  "<p> You might think that Hip hop star and music mogul Sean 'Puffy Daddy' Combs would keep a discreet profile as he awaits trial for possessing weapons. But you would be wrong. The notorious rapper is to launch his movie career with a role, which will further whip up the media storm that surrounds him. </p> <p> The star who, rightly or wrongly, has the image of a pistol-packing maverick will portray a New York gangster boss in Made , a thriller set in the boxing world. The film is bound to send typewriters and tongues into overdrive when it is released in the US later this year. Is he living up to his image or trying to have fun with it? It's the latter according to director Jon Favreau. 'If he took himself too seriously, he'd come off as Vanilla Ice,' he says. After missing out on the chance to play the lead in Oliver Stone's kinetic and well-received gridiron drama Any Given Sunday, Combs has decided to aim high and forgo a few million dollars - not that he needs them. </p> <p> Made is a low-budget independent film, which is unlikely to herald his arrival as a celluloid player equal to his girlfriend Jennifer Lopez. But the same team behind indie hit Swingers made the film. That will carry kudos among fans who have yet to appreciate Combs's musical mastery. Combs hasn't done a Will Smith. He won't be on the soundtrack although he offered. That could be a wise move. Combs's profile as a serious rapper lies between Richard Blackwood and Smith himself. If he can't hold his own against the bad boys on vinyl, at least he can do it on screen. Like fellow rappers including Ice Cube and LL Cool J, he wants to be both mainstream and edgy. Both the above artists have recently turned in solid performances in marquee movies - Ice Cube ( Three Kings ) and LL Cool J (Any Given Sunday) and their careers are developing. Combs's case won't reach the courts until next year. The public will have reached its verdict by then.</p>",
  "<p>Two words were not being spoken much at the Democrat's convention in Los Angeles: 'Monica' and 'Willard'. Monica needs neither introduction nor explanation, but Willard maybe does; it's the name Bill Clinton gave to his penis, according to another of his women, Gennifer Flowers. Clinton's reasoning: 'It's longer than Willie.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, in Malibu, a few miles up the Californian coast, Willard has been on the mind of one of Hollywood's most intriguing stars. Indeed, Willard is the protagonist in Joe Eszterhas's latest book, American Rhapsody , America's current number four bestseller. </p> <p>Eszterhas is the only movie screenwriter to attain and equal the superstardom of Tinseltown's actors and directors. He has had many famous and infamous ideas during his career walking in and out of Hollywood's portals, looking inside out and outside in. The best known is the 'pussy shot' of Sharon Stone crossing her legs while wearing no knickers in Basic Instinct . </p> <p>But even this was unambitious compared to American Rhapsody , which had political and movie-making circles holding their breath during the months before it was published. It's a hilarious and scandalous book, part-fact, part-fantasy, about a serious subject: Washington observed through the prism of Hollywood and vice versa. </p> <p>The Sharon Stone episode is there in full, along with a string of other fantasies that portray the actress as a dope-smoking, power-obsessed manipulator. Almost the entire Hollywood establishment is treated in the same way: Richard Gere, Michael Douglas, Warren Beatty, Gina Gershon, Glenn Close; many more are named and shamed as vain and self-obsessed. </p> <p>Writs were expected to fly as soon as the book was published and although no one has sued, Stone's agent, for one, has not ruled out action. At Knopf, the book's American publisher, the lawyers were sufficiently concerned to write a 30-page memo. In Britain two publishers have turned it down after taking legal advice. </p> <p>At the heart of American Rhapsody is an outrageous but astute portrait of Bill Clinton as America's 'first rock'n'roll President'; the man who ran the White House as a Hollywood mogul. </p> <p>'Politics has become entertainment,' says Eszterhas, 'and entertainment has become politics. Betty Thomas, who made Private Parts and Dr Dolittle, said that comedy in Hollywood was now \"funny moments with liberal inserts\", and that is right, because Sixties liberals and political correctness have taken over the industry. And the inner dynamics of Hollywood are like politics. Say you give a script to a group of executives - they all sit around, afraid to voice an opinion, saying nothing, waiting to know what the consensus is. Just like focus groups, opinion polls or a cabinet. Meanwhile, politics is about getting a candidate in front of the public as a star, politics as rock'n'roll, politics as a movie.' </p> <p>These mutually reflective prisms are a product of the cult of rock'n'roll, as epitomised by Eszterhas's own progression from Rolling Stone to Hollywood and now the innards of the Clinton scandal. 'I always wanted to be a rock'n'roll star,' admits Hollywood's highest-paid scriptwriter, 'and so did we all. So did Bill Clinton. Fact is we went on to do other things. But we still wanted to do our success like rock'n'roll stars.' </p> <p>That's why Bill should come to Hollywood, as he is urged to do in the pivotal chapter of American Rhapsody , 'Bubba in Pig Heaven'. 'You've got to move out here, Bubba - Hollywood is the place for you - this place reeks sex from its cellular pores. A townful of sluts on the make, Willard-friendly and experimental, bored with ham-and-egg, Al Gore orgasms.' </p> <p>Eszterhas's point is best illustrated by the knotty problem that dominated a year of American politics: the status of oral sex. Blow jobs were central to the Lewinsky scandal. Bill Clinton insisted that blow jobs do not count as sex; much of America agreed. Eszterhas assures the President that oral sex is what manicure girls offer in Hollywood as a matter of routine; they are 'a little break in a busy afternoon', just as they were for Bill in the Oval Office. Same for rock stars in between make-up and the stage. And that's the whole point: 'This is the permeation of rock'n'roll into everything,' says Eszterhas. </p> <p>He was born in Hungary in 1944, the year the country's Jews were rounded up and sent to Auschwitz. 'I've studied the Holocaust extensively,' he says. 'It's my lifelong obsession.' His family fled when the Red Army cut a swathe across the country, as far as Austria, where the boy and his parents were moved from camp to camp by British and American military authorities. </p> <p>After the war, they moved to the rust-belt town of Cleveland, Ohio, where his father edited a Catholic-Hungarian newspaper. Young Joe knew little English, but learned quickly enough to graduate and get a job on the Cleveland Plain Dealer , for which he interviewed Jimi Hendrix. He was obliged to leave the paper, however, after causing it to lose a libel suit to the tune of $16,000, a colossal sum in 1971. At that time, there was only one magazine that would give a home to a man who had developed a lifestyle propelled by a mix of drugs, booze and his Willard (by his own admission). He joined Jan Wenner's Rolling Stone and from there made the move to Hollywood. </p> <p>'I remembered what Hemingway said,' recalls Eszterhas. 'He said, \"Stop at the California state line, don't do it; it'll break your heart\". I decided not to stop and not to let it break my heart.' </p> <p>His first script, which got him into an immediate fight with Sylvester Stallone, was 'Fist' . 'It was 300 pages long. A page a minute - that's a long movie, and that's how little I knew.' At the time, Eszterhas said: 'I have always been fascinated by the corruption of power.' </p> <p>Eszterhas lives in a house on the ocean-front of the Malibu Riviera. Bob Dylan is a neighbour. The greeting is warm and relaxed; his kids charge around covered in sand and seawater. The sofas are decorated with Native American designs and the walls are a shrine to the Sixties: a picture of the Beatles signed by George Harrison; Muhammad Ali; Robert Kennedy. His own scripts - Jagged Edge , Music Box , Telling Lies in Hollywood , Sliver , Basic Instinct - share shelf space with the complete works of Charles Dickens. </p> <p>Eszterhas's wife, Naomi, moves as graciously around this m\u00e9nage as is possible for someone who has given birth to a fourth son, Luke, just two days before. They are blissfully happy, 'but it took me 50 years to get there,' says Eszterhas. Their meeting is a story in itself: Sharon Stone ran off with Eszterhas's friend, Bill McDonald, who duly deserted his wife, Naomi. As an act of friendship, Eszterhas and his wife, Geri, decided to take Naomi on a break, only for the screenwriter and the jilted wife to fall in love. 'If someone asked me if I introduced Bill and Sharon deliberately to get hold of Naomi, I'd say, subliminally, I'm sure they're right.' </p> <p>When most American writers call themselves 'outsiders', one is sceptical. With Eszterhas, you know it's more than partly true. 'I was six when we came to this country. When I was 14 or so, I still had a lot of trouble with it. I saw my father humiliated countless times in limitless ways. Every time I saw that happen, I was thrown into full-blown hysterics, like a two-year-old. I find myself with an immediate understanding of people who are on the outside, the Jews, whatever colour or creed they are. The showgirls, gays and outcasts.' </p> <p>In Hollywood, Eszterhas has done many out-of-the-ordinary things, but one above all. He has made the usually hidden figure of the screenwriter into someone not only visible but also bankable. 'I have only one loyalty - to my writing. I never wanted to be the head of a studio or a producer,' he says. 'I just wanted to make sure that what I write is what appears on screen, to not have some idiot change it on its way to the screen. There sure as hell are some idiots in Hollywood. Complete morons.' </p> <p>This attitude has led Eszterhas into some famous scraps, victories and defeats. It led to his fight with one of the most powerful titans in Hollywood, Mike Ovitz, when Eszterhas left Ovitz's Creative Artists empire to rejoin the agent with whom he originally worked in Hollywood, 'and who gave me my break' - out of loyalty. 'I'm the only sucker in Hollywood to be accused by Ovitz of disloyalty for doing something loyal,' he shrugs. </p> <p>His greatest triumph, he says, was protecting the coda scenes of both Jagged Edge and Flashdance from 'going to the wall in the hands of the directors'. His biggest failure, he says, was the loss of control of a script dear to him, 'written with my friend, Richard Marquand, who later died. It was about an escaped convict and the relationship he had with children. The script was taken and destroyed many years later by Jean-Claude Van Damme as Nowhere to Run . It lost its sensitivity, it lost everything. I don't like to remember that movie.' </p> <p>His favourite among his own movies is Music Box , in which Jessica Lange plays an attorney defending her Hungarian father against accusations that he was a collaborator with the Nazis and a war criminal. It was the most serious film to establish the hallmark Eszterhas theme - that everyone has a past, and that it is not always the past you want people to know about. </p> <p>It was a theme he returned to in Showgirls , which he admits is the least favourite of his own films. In the film, a girl escapes a life of prostitution to join a dance troupe in Vegas. The film contained an infamous rape scene, 'which we should not, I feel now, have shown, although I do insist that to show such a scene does not imply any complicity in it. I worry that we are approaching a time when that which is shocking is squeezed out by the Stalinism of political correctness. I think the messenger was slain for the message. It's against the tyranny of political correctness that American Rhapsody is an assault.' </p> <p>The book took shape after the failure of Showgirls and the sudden convergence of other movies. 'Every time I flicked channels, there I was, talking. I was talking too much and writing too little. So Naomi and I went to Hawaii. The phone was cut off and we lost touch. This gave me the chance to have a good think about my life.' </p> <p>On his return to Los Angeles, the Lewinsky scandal was in full bloom, and Eszterhas became addicted and immersed. 'I had in mind to do a piece for Rolling Stone , but I had no idea that it would become an obsession and a 1,000-page manuscript. Maybe as a writer I was getting hemmed in by scripts. I felt like someone let out of jail and going berserk.' </p> <p>Apart from Bill, Monica and the political cast, the book singles out Sharon Stone for treatment. Eszterhas claims to have 'created' Stone and to have been her lover. He feels a 'proprietary interest' when he hears about the friendship between Clinton and Stone. She was 'Bill Clinton's ideal woman' and 'every bit as political as he', given that 'a star's career is a lifelong political campaign'. She had 'ascended her star on the strength of her privates, but had handled the challenge well'. </p> <p>'I just had this idea that Bill and Sharon wanted to get together and should have got together,' explains Eszterhas. 'But Bill would not have got away with what Hillary has let him get away with. Not only would he have had scratches on his nose, but Sharon can be quite lethal with an ice-pick.' </p> <p>Does he have it in for Sharon Stone? Eszterhas puts on his sincere face. 'Of course not. Who would? She is cuddly and warm.' Cuddly and warm? 'She's a great actress and, like Marilyn Monroe, she's the sex symbol of her time. I'm just saying this: Kennedy-Monroe, Clinton-Stone - it would have been perfect.' </p> <p>Then there's Warren Beatty, whose political ambitions are derided not only because he is 'the man with the golden Willard'. He quotes Joan Collins: 'Three, four, five times a day was not unusual for Warren. And he was able to accept phone calls at the same time.' </p> <p>The most wonderfully insulting reference to Beatty concerns not his sexual prowess but his own presidential ambitions - and his lacking the concentration required to last four years in the White House. In conversation, Eszterhas adds: 'Warren's problem is common for method actors. It's a natural reaction - method actors getting too caught up in their parts. He had done Bulworth and he couldn't let go. He had to pretend that he could do it in real life. You see? Politics as Hollywood and vice versa.' </p> <p>The book also fantasises about Farrah Fawcett Majors defecating on a lawn at a public function and Richard Gere unzipping his flies and revealing 'no boxers' while pitching a movie idea to Eszterhas. </p> <p>Eszterhas said some weeks ago that he still intended to eat at Spago's and 'get good tables'. 'Since then,' he assured me last Wednesday, 'I have eaten there, got an excellent table and many people came up to me to say how much they enjoyed my book, not least because they were not in it.' </p> <p>'He's made a few enemies with this,' one insider told The Observer . But when Tina Brown threw a party for him, 'about 300 of the supposedly offended Hollywood people turned up. Mike Medevos, head of Phoenix, said he loved it and he was happy he wasn't in it. There are plenty more like him.' </p> <p>The White House has nothing to say, even though American Rhapsody is as sympathetic a portrait as Bill Clinton is likely to get in any book that is not by a party-political ally. In understanding the Willard-propulsion of Clinton the man, Eszterhas has explained the drama that befell Clinton the President. And by seeing that drama through Hollywood's eyes , he has spoken for that stubborn 65 per cent of Americans who were unmoved by the whole affair. </p> <p>But there is one thing Eszterhas cannot forgive: the lying. Richard Nixon casts the shadow of evil in this book. 'The important thing,' says Eszterhas, 'was that Nixon was a liar and the Sixties was about telling the truth. Now we had Clinton, jabbing his middle finger at us with a great big fucking lie.'</p>",
  "<p><strong> Observer:</strong> You've subtitled this book, 'A Novel of the Revolution'. Is it just about the American Revolution or something else as well ? </p> <p> <strong> Patrick McGrath:</strong> Centrally it's about the American Revolution, because it's about Martha Peake who would not have come to our notice were it not for her role in the American Revolution. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> Is she a historical figure ? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> She's a complete invention. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> And is New Morrock, the town to which she emigrates, also an invention? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> Completely.</p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> So you've borrowed things from all over the place? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> Yes, whatever came in handy. I believe the context of the novel is as true to the American Revolution as I could get it, but my own story is invented. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> There's a rape at the heart of the book. Was that difficult? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> It wasn't particularly, once I saw that it was necessary. I wanted the rape to occur for symbolic reasons largely, so that Martha could bear the child of her father in the New World, and then the problem remained of making it work psychologically. </p> <p>I wanted to get at the relationship of England and America, to explore that in terms of a parent-child relationship. I wanted to get at the mythical element within every nation's own history. The simplifications that occur; the distortions that occur in history, or within the transmission of historical fact into national narratives. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> Was there a specific moment of inspiration for your story? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> The overall story was inspired by the story that I think is now becoming familiar, of John Hunter, the anatomist, and his relationship to a man called O'Brien, an 8ft 2in Irish giant, whose skeleton can still be seen in the anatomy museum in Lincoln's Inn Field. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> So on one level the book is a deliberately Gothic historical novel. Did you enjoy the experience of writing in this genre? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> I've always had a leaning towards the Gothic, and the Gothic seems to permeate my imagination, although I never sit down and say I'm going to set out and write a Gothic novel. But in this case I thought I had a chance to actually employ the Gothic in the most precise and proper way, because Gothic is a genre that concerns itself about time, and particularly the way that time both ruins things and also conceals things. I thought these attributes of the genre were perfectly suited to a novel that is to some extent questioning the historical method. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> But it's also about memory, recollection and story-telling. </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> Particularly memory as a sort of national attribute. The way that a country will remember its own past in certain ways that tend to reflect its own sense of importance, sense of glory, sense of triumph, sense of the struggles it has come through. The United States is remarkable among nations for this. So I wanted to see if personal memory, the way that we adapt and adjust and distort our memories in order to provide ourselves with the best possible biography, if you couldn't just transfer that process complete to the business of a nation telling its own story through history, with all of the foibles and idiosyncrasies of personal memory. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> Martha Peake's story is told by an unreliable narrator who is also receiving the narration from a second narrator. Was that technically complex? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> It was a struggle to come up with that idea. I had my story, Harry Peake and his relationship with Martha, and then Martha in America. What I didn't have was a frame for it. I didn't know who was to tell this story, and I thought of Martha, I thought of Silas, I thought of the anatomist Lord Drogo, and then it occurred to me to have a young man, Ambrose, come out and speak to an old man. Neither of them is particularly reliable, and yet between them they somehow construct this thing that we will call the 'History of Martha Peake'. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> The spirit of Dickens hovered in a benign way over much of the book. </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> I always feel rather blinkered when I am writing a novel, and I seem to be inventing out of a whole cloth somehow, but I think I deliberately feed the imagination by reading. In particular, I read Barnaby Rudge for this book. But there's a certain way in which the reading is absorbed at a level which is not employed in the actual writing. </p> <p>I let that all happen in an unconscious way, so I don't feel threatened by the proximity of Dickensian London. I was more conscious of Hogarth actually than Dickens. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> Which writers would you say have influenced you the most? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> I think it's more a matter of books. I have a personal canon which would include Death in Venice and Heart of Darkness, Wuthering Heights, probably Brideshead Revisited, Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde, The Picture of Dorian Gray, Dracula. Probably for this one, I think, Roderick Random, I re-read that for this and went through my Fielding and my Johnson and Boswell. </p> <p>But I think that little clutch of rather dark nineteenth, early twentieth-century novels and novellas would be my personal canon. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> At times, the novel seems reminiscent of Stevenson. </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> When I'd finished my previous book, Asylum, I wanted very consciously to write something that was much more driven by plot and narrative than by internal psychological development and went back to Stevenson and read things like Kidnapped and Treasure Island as well as Jekyll and Hyde. </p> <p>I thought I would write a novel that gives the same sorts of pleasures that Stevenson does, and also John Buchan as well - romantic adventure. The idea was to get a sort of Stevensonian narrative pleasure working in the book, if at all possible. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> How long did it take to write? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> Four years, which was largely spent immersed in American Revolutionary history, so as not to make a fool of myself. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> Did you go out to Boston? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> I did a tour of New England and tramped about battlefields and so forth. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> Is New Morrock based on anywhere? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> It's generic north Massachusetts or Maine, which at that time was part of Massachusetts. It seems a bit wild to be Massachusetts, so I imagine that it's somewhere in Maine. Actually it feels to me more Cornish than American. The cliffs of Maine don't tend to rise to those heights. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> What are you writing now? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> Nothing at the moment. I'm mulling and reading and thinking and preparing to write. Something contemporary, I think. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> But Gothic? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> I don't know. As I say, I don't start off thinking I'm going to write a Gothic novel. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> But that's your subject, isn't it ? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> Yes, I suppose insanity has always been of great interest. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> Why is that? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> Probably I got it from my father, who was a psychiatrist in charge of Broadmoor from 1955 to 1981. He taught me to see that the insane are ill rather than monstrous, and that they deserve the same sympathy and respect that any ill person deserves. I think my childhood gave me a moral position from which to develop character. I found that when I began to write fiction I ran through a number of genres in my first year and settled then on some sort of pastiche of Edgar Allan Poe, and sensed that I was on the territory that I should be on. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> And did you always want to be a writer? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> I did, but then that sort of dream was submerged for about a decade from my late teens to my late twenties - when I thought that I should be doing a more socially responsible activity, much under the influence partly of the time and partly of my family, all of whom ended up being doctors or teachers of one sort or another. </p> <p>But in the end that didn't work out, so I returned to the notion of writing as a last resort.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Martha Peake</strong><br>Patrick McGrath<br>Viking \u00a312.99, pp352<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502444806,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Gothic was an eighteenth-century invention, of course. And there's a wonderful sense of rightness about Patrick McGrath, the best of Gothic novelists, turning back to the period and writing this astonishing historical novel. For some time, I toyed with various reviewer's formulae along the lines of 'McGrath is the best Gothic novelist since'... Since who? Mary Shelley? Ann Radcliffe? Forget it. McGrath may be the best Gothic novelist ever. </p> <p>The remarkable thing about McGrath is that, though he works within the conventions of his genre, he always seems to see the full range of their implications. Gothic, for McGrath, is not just a literary mode which may be dropped into or out of at will; it is the state of mind we have lived in since the Enlightenment.</p> <p>One of the most pleasing things about Martha Peake is that it doesn't see the haunted house terrors which the late eighteenth century liked so much as an irrelevant diversion from its more serious inquiries. Rather, those serious inquiries - 'the American Revolution, the death of God, and Hume's epistemology' - exist alongside and within a Gothic world view. It feels like a real understanding of the period, and a big step forward in our understanding of ourselves. </p> <p>It's set in the 1760s and 1770s and tells the story of a poor hunchback, Harry Peake, and his daughter Martha. Peake's extraordinary deformations come to the attention of an amateur physiologist, Lord Drogo, who exhibits him and shows signs of wanting to acquire his body for his museum of curiosities. Martha escapes the dreadful Castle Drogo, after being raped and impregnated by her gin-sodden father, and runs away to America. </p> <p>Most of Martha Peake is more or less indistinguishable from the most elegant haunted-house nightmare one ever read. There is an insane hunchback, roaming the remote Castle Drogo. A lecherous body-snatcher hangs about, eyeing up any likely candidates for his employer's knife and occasionally delivering hanged wretches from Tyburn. Most of the story is told by an opium-addicted geriatric in front of the fire at dead of night. Beloved, angelic wives are killed in tragic fires; the children of incestuous rapes are born and discovered to be misshapen monsters; smugglers haunt the nearby coves, ready to signal to waiting ships. </p> <p>Not many novelists now would have the nerve to end a chapter like this, 'And then, in the silence, with a last flare in the whivering gloom, one wall sconce in the ante-chamber gave out with a sputtering sigh', and then, a second later, 'and in the sudden darkness, a hand fell on my shoulder'. Gothic is, of all literary genres, the most irredeemably trivial, the one most incapable of dealing with the horrors it so eagerly evokes. One could not write a Gothic novel about Auschwitz. </p> <p>McGrath's brilliance, however, is to see the Gothic fantasy within a proper, serious context. His last novel, the sublime Asylum, let the horrors arise slowly from the solipsistic and public mythologies of madness and psychiatry; this one uses the most tawdry trappings of Otranto and Udolpho to explore the mind and history of the age which dreamt them up.</p> <p>Take the smugglers; they are an ordinary sort of theatrical prop. But why were they smuggling? Well, to avoid duty, which weighed heavily on the poor; and when Martha, later in the novel, escapes to America and meets more smugglers there, the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution are not far away. And we realise we are in the hands of a novelist of unusual intelligence. </p> <p>The fineness of Martha Peake is not in the absorbed exploration of intellectual life, but in the astonishing virtuosity of the plot. There are at least two unreliable narrators; there is a series of lucid, shocking reversals towards the end, which cannot even be hinted at; there is, throughout, a wonderful sense of delay and suspension, screwing the tension up to its highest possible point. If, in the end, it is a dazzling divertissement rather than the grand and troubling meditation of Asylum, it is an unusually intelligent and serious one. </p> <p>At the end, the reader starts to wonder about things McGrath has not hinted at. If Martha's son inherits his father/grandfather's deformity, how can that deformity result, as the novel says, from a fire? And bigger questions; Martha runs away from a country which hangs innocents like a poor thieving actress, Mary Magdalen Smith, to America, land of the free. But the reader is bound to reflect that there are plenty of Mary Magdalen Smiths still being put to death in Texas today. You can't trust the words of this novel. But, my God, you trust its author.</p>",
  "Every morning for the last week, Admiral Vyacheslav Alexeyevich Popov has paced the bridge of the Peter the Great, the nuclear-powered Kirov-class cruiser which is the flagship of the Russian Northern Fleet. Every morning the view has been the same. <p>As the dim Arctic night has lifted, he has seen the same ships rolling with the heavy swell of the Barents Sea, felt the wind tugging at his gold-braided peaked cap and watched the same men send the same inadequate machines into the frigid waters. Three hundred and fifty-seven feet below, on the ocean floor, lies submarine K-141, the Kursk: a 500ft, 14,000- tonne, double-hulled Oscar-II class submarine. On board are an undisclosed number of torpedoes and missiles (each with 1,000lb warheads), two nuclear reactors (each capable of producing as much power as one of the smaller British power stations) and, almost certainly now, the corpses of 118 men. </p> <p>Nine days ago, 45 year-old Gennady Lyachev, the captain of the Kursk, was relaxing in his quarters at the submarine base of Vidyayevo. For a week his crew had been waiting. Now, finally, they had been given the go-ahead. </p> <p>At about 8.30am on Saturday morning, he took the Kursk north down the wide Kola inlet to join the rest of the famed Northern Fleet 50 miles out in the shallow Barents Sea. By 10am it was in position. Around the sub, 33 warships checked and turned and tested their weapons systems under a blank sky. </p> <p>Twelve miles away from the Kursk's position, a Norwegian intelligence vessel, the Marjata, was rolling with the heavy swell. Two American submarines, out playing the Cold War game of Arctic cat-and-mouse with the Russian fleet, were also close by. The Northern Fleet's summer manoeuvres allow the West to judge the capabilities of the Russian navy. But after days of observation nothing of real interest had turned up. </p> <p>At 10.31am on Saturday, something did. Listening devices on the Marjata picked up a muffled explosion. Analysts took it to be a depth charge. But 2 minutes 11 seconds later came a far bigger blast. Even the USS Loyal, an American acoustic data-gathering vessel 250 miles away, heard it. Within an hour the observers noticed the Northern Fleet's deployment change radically. Something dreadful had happened. </p> <p>We know that at 10.29 the Kursk was engaged in a weapons-firing exercise with the rest of the fleet. It would have been at 'periscope depth' - around 100ft. The Kursk has six torpedo tubes in its bows and silos for 12 more missiles - probably SS-N19 'Shipwrecks' with a range of 300 miles - stored along its sides. </p> <p>When it was the submarine's turn to loose one of these formidable weapons, Captain Lyachin would have given the order to fire and waited for the shuddering roar of the outgoing projectile and the reports of his gunners. But it seems that one of the missiles prematurely detonated while firing. Some think it was an SS-N19 in a vertical launcher. Others say it was probably an SS-N16 'Stallion' fired from a torpedo tube in the bows. </p> <p>The explosion blasted a massive hole on the right side of the bows of the sub. The Kursk would have twisted and bucked under the blast and then lurched sickeningly down and to the right as the water jetted in through the torn hull. Anyone in the forwardmost of the sub's 10 bulkheads who had survived the explosion would have been smashed unconscious by the blasting sea and killed almost instantly. They wouldn't even have known they were drowning. </p> <p>In the control room, Lyachin had only a few seconds to react. He would have issued three or four terse orders. 'It's not like the films,' said Richard Sharpe, editor of Jane's Fighting Ships and a former nuclear submarine captain. 'Submarine captains don't shout.' </p> <p>First, the captain would have ordered the Kursk's ballast tanks to be 'blown' or filled with air to boost the ailing sub's buoyancy. As forward movement also keeps a crippled sub afloat, he would also have ordered the reactors to be cranked up to generate maximum speed. Then, if he had time, he would have paused to take stock. </p> <p>However, he almost certainly did not have time. Even if sailors in the forward bulkheads moved fast enough to shut the water-tight doors the enormous pressure of the water would have simply blasted them open again. Hundreds of tonnes of freezing cold water would been jetting into Lyachin's control room before any emergency procedures could be activated. The veteran seaman simply had no chance to save his ship. Within seconds he was going down with it. </p> <p>With its forward third full of water, the Kursk tipped downwards and headed for the seabed. The explosion ruptured the right ballast tank and the imbalance would have given the sub the 12 to 20 degrees list that Russian officials have reported. </p> <p>A submarine under control would take 95 seconds under normal conditions to dive 350ft. The Kursk, with its 50,000-horsepower reactors driving it down nose first, would have taken less than half that time. Two minutes and 15 seconds after the first explosion, the Norwegian listeners aboard the Marjata recorded a second explosion, far bigger than the first. It was, they said, the equivalent of around two tonnes of high-explosive and measured 3.5 on the Richter scale. It blew out the whole of the front right section of the sub, buckling its hull as far back as the conning tower. By the time of the second blast - almost certainly other munitions going off - the vessel was probably on the ocean floor. No mayday had been sent, no emergency beacons released, no flares sent to the surface. It had all happened too fast. </p> <p>Every ship in the Northern Fleet must have known something terrible had happened. At 11.30am the submarine failed to make a pre-arranged radio contact. Nearly 14 hours later, at 3.21am, the operator of a sonic depth finder on board the Peter the Great informed Admiral Popov that he had registered an 'abnormality' on the seabed. It was the Kursk. </p> <p>Six hours later the first specialist rescue ships were in place above the stricken submarine. For a day the story was kept from the press. Then it leaked. When the questions started coming at them, the navy spokesmen stalled. They were in touch with the crew, they said. There was air and power on board the sub. They were 'confident of a positive outcome'. </p> <p>The truth was very different. When, on Sunday morning, President Putin asked Defence Minister Igor Sergeyev what chance they had of saving the crew, he got a blunt answer. 'Extremely small,' Sergeyev said. </p> <p>From Sunday to Thursday last week a fierce storm battered the Barents Sea. The Kolokol-class diving bells that were the first option of the rescuers were useless as their motherships rolled up and down with the swell. Making a connection to the Kursk's rear escape hatch proved impossible. </p> <p>Instead three mini-submarines were deployed. But though the craft dived round the clock, thick clouds of silt and strong currents made it impossible to find the hatch, let alone connect to it. When - on Friday morning - one of the subs did connect, the crew found that the hatch was so misshapen that an airtight connection was impossible. </p> <p>Now rescue hopes depend on a British state-of-the-art 'Slingsby LP5' mini-sub that is on a private exclusive contract to the Royal Navy. It was only on Wednesday, when Putin finally gave permission for the rescuers to accept Western offers of help, that the sub, its crew and support team were flown in an Antonov cargo plane from Scotland to Trondheim in Norway. From there they have been making their way on a Norwegian ship towards the Barents Sea. For the sailors and their relatives, the LP5 is the last hope. </p> <p>The contrast between the grim 'secret cities' of the north and Sochi's Bocharov Ruchei, the sumptuous sprawling complex by the Black Sea converted into a presidential retreat by Boris Yeltsin, could not be greater. There are tennis courts, swimming pools, cinemas and exclusive beaches. For a week, as the drama being played out under the Arctic seas 2,000 miles to the north gripped the nation, Putin obstinately stayed put. </p> <p>While millions of Russians were glued to their TV screens, watching the drama unfold, the commander-in-chief seemed indifferent to the fate of the 118 Kursk crewmen. His official engagements included appointing new Russian Ambassadors to Jamaica and Chile, sending a 70th birthday card to a well-known actress, and debating Russia's brain-drain with a group of professors. </p> <p>It was five days before he made his first, brief statement on the crisis. On Wednesday, after a 25-minute phone call from President Clinton, he finally gave the green light for the British to get involved. Then, on Friday, he suddenly announced that his first thought when he learnt of the disaster was that he should be there. He didn't go because he didn't want to be in the way, he said. </p> <p>It was a singularly unconvincing performance, coming after two days of unprecedentedly vicious attacks in the Moscow press. But the political logic for his silence is clear. </p> <p>Chatting from Sochi by phone on Tuesday evening with Ehud Barak, the embattled Israeli Prime Minister, Putin is said to have told him that it was already too late for the Kursk seamen. The ex-KGB man clearly thought that putting himself at the head of a lost cause was not going to do his action-man image any good at all. </p> <p>But he miscalculated. His inaction was politically costly. For the first time in his time in power, Putin was seen to falter. The politicians and the senior naval officers, once almost legendary figures inspiring awe and respect, now were the target of very different emotions. </p> <p>Ilya Klebanov, the Deputy Prime Minister who Putin appointed to head the government inquiry into the accident, was mauled by the wives of the seamen who hurled abuse at the authorities, weeping, fainting and screaming at a meeting at the Kursk's home garrison of Vidyayevo, 30 miles from Murmansk. </p> <p>And the admirals' bungling, lying, and arrogance triggered a wave of popular revulsion. The newspapers contrasted Putin's vanishing act with how Western leaders, in the age of television democracy, take charge at times of national disasters or humanitarian emergencies. </p> <p>The top brass and the Kremlin elite just didn't understand, the commentators said. It's the same old story, they alleged. It's the traditional Russian elite's contempt for the lives of Russian servicemen and the suffering of their families. We thought Putin was different, they said. We were wrong. </p> <p>The fate of the Kursk has struck a chord across the nation in a way not witnessed in years. </p> <p>The huge steel tomb on the bed of the Barents Sea has become a symbol of all the grievances, the pent-up frustrations, the anger and the disappointment in contemporary Russia. </p> <p>And while Putin sunned himself in Sochi, the mood inside the navy headquarters in Moscow was getting more bitter by the hour. The atmosphere was 'openly menacing', said a source. 'The admirals are just going through the motions.' </p> <p>'See if the British can do any better,' said one officer sourly. </p> <p>Few now think there will be anyone left for the British to help. Until Tuesday, someone was heard tapping SOS messages on the hull of the Kursk. Since then, however, there has been nothing. No radio contact, no sonar telephone, nothing. </p> <p>Russian officials believe that at least a third of the crew were dead before the Kursk hit the bottom. The areas damaged, and thus flooded, include the sub's accommodation areas. Richard Sharpe, a retired British submariner, believes that the only bulkheads that would have held back the waters are those protecting the twin nuclear reactors in the middle of the vessel. He thinks the rear half of the sub - including the reactor control room and the vast chambers housing the transmission - would have been relatively undamaged. </p> <p>There are usually 20 sailors on shift in these areas. The huge 190-megawatt reactors could provide them with light and clean air and, though they would have been without water and food, they could have sat tight until someone got to them. </p> <p>But, the Russian navy says, the reactors are not running. The emergency shut- down procedures may have been activated by the shock of the accident but experts say that is unlikely. The crew probably closed them down themselves, as they had been trained to do in the event of a disaster or just in the fearful confusion. They would have been unable to restart them. </p> <p>The lights would have gone out and the cold become intense. The water at that depth is almost freezing. It would have been like sitting in a dark, meat fridge at the bottom of a 400ft-deep swimming pool. Within 48 hours the air would have started to go bad. The Kursk's 'air scrubbers' - which process the foul air - would have needed power to function. Any batteries would have been quickly exhausted. Weak and traumatised, the men would be increasingly prone to hypothermia. </p> <p>The build-up of exhaust gases would have made their condition worse. Normal air is 4 per cent carbon dioxide. When the level reaches 5 per cent, severe headaches and nausea start. Co-ordination and mobility start to suffer. When the level reaches 10 per cent most humans lose consciousness. They don't slip away, but lie choking and gasping in pain and terror until the darkness finally closes in. The men in the front of the Kursk died in seconds as a wall of water crushed and filled their lungs with water. The men at the rear followed an identical physiological path, but much, much more slowly. </p> <p>Yesterday, the eighth day of the crisis, residents from the closed town of Vidyayevo, where the Kursk command is based, said that the atmosphere was extremely tense. Relatives of the trapped submariners had gathered in the town, where they were being cared for by counsellors. </p> <p>A special train arrived yesterday morning bringing the mothers of the conscript sailors to the bleak shores were their young sons once lived and trained. </p> <p>The people of Vidyayevo know all about disaster. Eleven years ago, 120 men died when another submarine, the Komsomolets, caught fire and sank. Every year dozens of fresh wreaths are scattered over the sea in memorial. </p> <p>Next year there will be scores more. </p>",
  "<p>While reporters this week wasted their papers' budgets in Los Angeles covering the shadow puppetry called the Democratic Convention, America's political future was being decided 80 miles south, in San Diego. </p> <p>Here, where a bilious tumble of freeways, McDonald's and Wal-Marts smashes up against the Mexican border, San Diego's 2.6 million residents have been involuntarily enrolled as laboratory rats in a scary economic experiment. Just weeks ago, San Diego became the first city in America to end the regulation of electricity prices. </p> <p>When California's state senate voted to bring the miracle of market competition to electricity, they wrote right into the law that domestic prices would fall by 'at least 20 per cent'. No points for guessing what happened. The price for energy rose by 379 per cent compared with last year. </p> <p>Actually, Californians were lucky. I located Beth Emory, former counsel for the agency that runs the daily power auction. She said that on the first hot summer day, when California needed every bit of juice it could find, generating companies bid in their electricity at $9,999 per unit. This was 1,000 times the formerly controlled price of $10. </p> <p>But San Diegans were fortunate. In their greed-crazed rush, the sellers assumed the system's computers could only handle four-digit bids. In fact, the computers would have accepted seven figures, taking bids high enough to bankrupt half the families in the state in one day. </p> <p>I have been able to trace San Diego's economic plague to the original carrier: one Daniel Fessler. Fessler, the Golden State's former chief utility regulator, flew to England some years ago and carried back with him an infatuation with Margaret Thatcher's economic theorems and an unnatural affection for her troubled offspring, the England and Wales Power Pool. </p> <p>The Pool, at around 4pm or so each day, is seized by a clique of electricity companies which crank up prices by as much as 2,000 per cent. Even Britain's somnolent regulators have twigged to the fact that this supposed free-market auction house is, as Ofgem recently reported, a playground for price-fixing and collusion. </p> <p>One suspects California's politicos knew this. After all, the majority of Britain's electricity system is owned by the same US operators that have San Diego by the bulbs, including Enron (Houston), Edison International (Los Angeles), PPL and Southern Company (Atlanta). This week, the last pair took over Hyder, Wales's water and power utility. </p> <p>But something extraordinary has happened in San Diego. Laid-back Californians have leapt off their surfboards and are waving two fingers in the air and chanting 'Boycott!' </p> <p>The electricity companies can send out their bloated bills, but the tanned masses are not going to pay. By the thousands and now, apparently, by the tens of thousands, customers have simply continued to pay only the old, lower, prices. </p> <p>Joining the boycott this week: the city's school system, the Council of Churches and even, without a hint of shame, the state senator who sponsored the original deregulation law. </p> <p>In Bolivia, when British-American, owner of the city of Cochabamba's utility, hiked prices and customers boycotted bill payments, the government confronted protesters with bullets and martial law. </p> <p>But in California, protesters were met by panicked politicians. The leftish governor of California, Democrat Gray Davis, drafted an emergency law to knock back prices retroactively by 60 per cent. The state's utility regulators effectively endorsed the revolt by barring San Diego Gas and Electric from cutting off service to customers who refuse payments through October (up to election day). </p> <p>The Governor has launched an investigation into market manipulation. According to consumer advocate Mike Florio, a member of the power system's oversight panel, the governor won't have far to look. There is 'stacking and cramming' (tricks learned in the UK) plus false scheduling and transmission line games that have cost San Diego about $304 million this summer. </p> <p>On one day, for example, an Enron trader sold the state about 500 megawatts of power to go over a 15 mw line, which is like pouring a gallon of gasoline into a thimble. This forced the system operators to make costly emergency purchases, blowing market prices through the roof. </p> <p>The power pirates are stunned by the public revolt. After all, though San Diego prices have skyrocketed to about 10p per kilowatt hour, this is no more than US power companies typically charge their British customers - who endure the fleecing with a stoic shrug. </p> <p>So what has got the beach bunnies up in arms? Amer ica's little secret is that the New World Order of free markets and deregulation is for export only. America has always expected that, within its borders, the public, through state power, should squeeze down the prices and profits of monopoly service companies. </p> <p>The city of Los Angeles owns its own electricity and water system and virtually gives the stuff away. Good. We don't have to put up with World Bank dicta for privatisation and market pricing designed, as we Angelenos say, for the rest of you schmucks. </p> <p>And there's something else. Deep in its commercialised, Disneyfied heart, America still throbs with a certain democratic spirit. Not, as Jonathan Freedland would have it, the spirit of Thomas Jefferson and the Bill of Rights, of toleration and public discourse; I'm talking about the spirit of Charles Bronson and Death Wish, the coiled snake on the Revolutionary Flag: Don't tread on me! </p> <p>Since long before the recent price hike, 46,000 San Diegans have voluntarily paid $15 a year to belong to the Utility Consumers Action Network (Ucan), the sole work of which is to harass, challenge, sue and otherwise drive electricity and phone companies up against the wall. </p> <p>Ucan sponsored the can't-pay-won't-pay radio adverts. And there are other utility-bashing groups. It is the American genius for public vengeance. </p> <p>The San Diego power rebellion, blessed by the state's Democrats, should be one hell of an election platform for Al Gore. After all, it was Fessler and his fellow Republicans, when they controlled the state's government, who passed the deregulation law. But Gore has consumer blood on his hands. </p> <p>Though not something they would put on their campaign posters, Clinton and Gore have promoted California-style deregulation as the model for the entire US. </p> <p>(Let's just note that a big winner in the deregulation game is Entergy of Little Rock, Hillary's former client. On the other hand, another electricity profiteer is Sam Wyly, a man who made wealthy George W Bush even wealthier.) </p> <p>This week, while Al practiced his platitudes to salarymen and retainers inside the convention hall, Ralph Nader came to town to remind Californians that he was a founding father of Ucan. </p> <p>Polls show fed-up Californians giving Nader 10 per cent of the state's votes. If Nader's support holds, Bush will win all of California's electoral votes, and thereby, the White House. </p> <p>It seems unfair that Gore should pay the price for his complicity in the electricity shake-down, especially as George W's buddies joined in the rip-off. </p> <p>But then, given that Gore has also entered the ghoulish contest over who is the strongest supporter for capital punishment, it is only just that his campaign may come to an end in California's electric chair. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gregory.palast@theguardian.com\">gregory.palast@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "She is a master of disguise and one of Britain's most wanted women. Detectives this weekend appealed for help in tracing Fiona Mont, the 30-year-old daughter of a prominent Sussex Tory family who has been on the run since faking her own death in January. But now, say police, a number of sightings have placed her firmly in Europe. <p> Nicknamed 'The Cat' because of her ability to keep ahead of detectives, Mont has proved expert at evading capture. Police say that by using seduction and charm she has become one of the most sophisticated and cunning fugitives they have encountered.</p> <p> Mont faces charges relating to a huge computer fraud she is believed to have masterminded. Police are reluctant to give specific details of her probable location, as they believe friends and former lovers in Britain are keeping her informed of police progress. Her downfall began last September, when Steve Skerrett decided to buy a computer. A detective constable with Sussex police, Skerrett responded to an advertisement in his local paper and found himself sitting in a basement flat in Hove with Mont and her boyfriend, surrounded by boxes of new, branded computers. </p> <p> He arranged to return the next Monday, but in the meantime spoke to a colleague who had been working on a case in which a computer manufacturer had been defrauded of tens of thousands of pounds of machines. A few calls reinforced their suspicions, and Skerrett returned on the Monday with a search warrant. Skerrett said of his first visit to Mont's flat: 'We started talking about our jobs, and I told them I was a policeman. There was no reaction, not even a flicker. Nothing at all. She was ice cool about it. I think, to be honest, she probably found the idea of selling something to me quite amusing. It's all a bit of a game to her.'</p> <p> While on bail charged with fraud in this case, Mont continued to play games, calling Skerrett up at his office and inviting him out for a drink. He declined. Mont's confidence crumbled only when she attended an identification parade and was picked out by witnesses. Fearful of facing trial and possibly prison, she resorted to desperate measures and faked suicide. Her Rover 820 car was found abandoned on the edge of the notorious suicide spot at Beachy Head, near Eastbourne, a week later. Her keys had been left on the edge of the 535ft cliff - it seemed she had thrown herself off. </p> <p> A search-and-rescue operation involving police and members of the Coastguard using helicopters and dozens of boats was launched, but called off after two days when Fiona's mother, Joan, said her daughter had called her. Mont now faces charges of wasting police time and skipping bail, as well as the original fraud allegations. </p> <p>Police now know that, after leaving her car at Beachy Head, Mont fled the country in an aircraft piloted by Graham Hesketh, whose nickname is 'The Baron' and who is wanted by police in connection with a number of offences. It was originally thought the pair used the flight as a ruse to come back to England undetected, but detectives are now convinced they remained in Europe, where they may be engaged in a range of other criminal activities.</p> <p> Mont has also left behind a string of broken hearts. One boyfriend is now in prison near Paris awaiting trial on drugs charges. Another is on bail in the UK. 'She is an extremely clever woman,' said Skerrett. 'She can make herself look like a duchess or a tramp and will use anyone who can be of benefit to her.'</p> <p> For Mont, life on the run is a far cry from her privileged upbringing. Her mother is a prominent local Tory, a former leader of East Sussex County Council and president of the Rottingdean Conservative Association. Her late father, Neville, was a solicitor and former Under Sheriff of East Sussex. Mont was educated at the \u00a36,975-a-year St Mary's School in Brighton, but was expelled because of her delinquent behaviour. Although she has been in and out of trouble with the law ever since, Mont has only two minor convictions and has never been to prison. </p> <p>She frequently uses her background as evidence that she has no need to turn to crime. Mont studied law and worked briefly at a local business centre. Using these skills she has set up companies and is believed to have used accounts which indicate these companies have turnovers in excess of \u00a31 million a year. Police say she used these accounts to apply to various computer companies for lines of credit and order tens of thousands of pounds of goods, which she allegedly sells without ever paying for them. Mont is believed to have pocketed more than \u00a3300,000 in this way in the past year alone. </p> <p>She has allegedly placed dozens of ads in the Yellow Pages for her bogus companies, which have never been paid for. She has legally held passports in a number of different names to disguise her identity. After changing her name by deed poll, she sends off her old passport and applies for one in her new name. As anyone is entitled to change their name as often as they want, no checks are made at the Passport Office to see whether such changes could be used for criminal purposes. She uses a number of aliases, including Frances Montgomery, Alison Miller, Jacqueline Mayhew and Jamina Chadwick. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:tony.thompson@observer.co.uk\"> tony.thompson@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "The icecap at the North Pole has turned to water for the first time in 50 million years. Scientists aboard a Russian icebreaker have discovered an ice-free patch of water a mile wide at the top of the world. <p>It is the first time humans have seen water at the pole, and it is the most dramatic evidence yet of the impact that global warming is having. Satellite studies have shown that the ice pack is more than 40 per cent thinner than it was 50 years ago. The last time the pole was awash with water was during the Eocene period, 55 million years ago, when the world's climate grew significantly warmer. </p> <p>'It was totally unexpected' said Dr James McCarthy, director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University and co-leader of a group working for the UN-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. McCarthy was the lecturer aboard a tourist cruise to the North Pole on the Russian ice-breaker Yamal. </p> <p>Global warming is thought to be affecting the Arctic far more than other regions of the world, with temperatures rising three to five times faster. The icecap is melting so fast that climatologists have predicted that within 50 years it will disappear totally during the summer. This would cause devastation to the wildlife on the ice floes. Already, polar bears are reported to be losing weight because of difficulties in finding food, and walruses are having fewer young. The permafrost in north Alaska and Canada is also melting. </p> <p>Normally the ice pack at the North Pole is three to 10 metres thick, but the Yamal crunched through thin ice and intermittent open water on its way to the pole from Spitsbergen, in the Svalbard archipelago. The ice was so thin that sunlight could penetrate it. When the ship reached the pole, water lapped at its bow. The captain of the ice-breaker, who had made the trip 10 times in recent years, said he had never before seen water at the pole. The scientists also reported seeing ivory sea-gulls, the first time they have been sighted there. The Yamal had to steam a further six miles before the 100 passengers could get out and be able to say that they had stood at - or near - the North Pole. McCarthy said the passengers were astounded by what they saw: 'There was a sense of alarm. Global warming was real, and we were seeing its effects for the first time that far north.' </p> <p>Dr Malcom McKenna, of the American Museum of Natural History, also aboard the Yamal, said: 'I don't know if anybody in history has ever got to 90 degrees north to be greeted by water, not ice. Some people who pooh-pooh global warming might wake up if shown that even the pole is beginning to melt.' </p> <p>The world's climate grew significantly warmer during the Eocene period, when water and jungles dominated the polar regions. In the last 100 years, the world's temperature has risen by about one degree Centigrade. Eight out of 10 of the hottest years have been in the last 20 years.</p>",

  "Some friends of mine finally seem to have resolved the constipation that their two-year-old son, Freddie, has suffered from since birth. Technically speaking, childhood constipation is caused by an abnormal amount of waste matter building up in the lower bowel, which then becomes so hard and uncomfortable that the child is either unable, or afraid, to pass it, with the result that the waste in the bowel becomes even more compacted, thereby exacerbating the condition. Freddie could go for days without passing a stool, and frequently howled with pain when the root of the problem eventually shifted. <p>Constipation has various triggers: the gut may temporarily seize up following an illness, while children may sometimes deliberately hold in motions after a bout of diarrhoea in case they have an 'accident'. In Freddie's case, because one stool had actually ripped his anus, he understandably did everything that he could to avoid the potentially painful process of going to the loo. </p> <p>Overenthusiastic potty-training on the part of parents may be to blame, too. If you put your child under too much pressure to perform on the potty, he may deliberately choose not to do so when he's angry. Another extreme reaction is that of a child I once saw in my practice who eventually had to have her bowel emptied in hospital. Her parents, who had put her 'accidents' down to laziness, had scolded her so much that she had become frightened to go to the loo. It is vital that you use positive feedback and do not criticise your child. If you think that it would help them, and they are old enough to understand, try introducing a reward system by recording lavatorial 'successes' on a chart, marking them with a star and then a reward for a collection of stars. Until they have established regular toilet habits, try to get into the habit of praising younger children and giving them a little treat each time they pass a stool. Encouraging Freddie to go to the loo regularly, made him feel more confident and less scared that he'd have an 'accident'. </p> <p>If your child is constipated, the first thing you should do is ascertain whether they are drinking enough fluids, which is especially important during the summer months. If you're still bottle-feeding, you may have to supplement their fluid intake with boiled water, or, once they've reached six to eight weeks of age, some undiluted, unsweetened fruit juice. Two-year-olds should drink at least half a litre of water a day, rising to three-quarters of a litre in the case of three-year-olds. It doesn't matter whether they drink still, sparkling or tap water, but avoid giving children sweetened juices, which will rot their teeth. And because water is far more hydrating than sweet drinks, and therefore better able to soften a stool, serve only water with meals. </p> <p>Because sweet and fatty foods tend to have a constipating effect, make sure that your child isn't eating too many fast foods, crisps or chocolates. Reserve them as treats - or even as rewards for regular toilet habits - and restrict your child to a couple of pieces of chocolate, for example, rather than a whole bar. Children who are allowed to overindulge in convenience foods are less likely to eat fruit, vegetables and wholegrains, all of which are essential fibre-providers, the fibres that they contain swell in the presence of water and stimulate the gut to move. All fruits and vegetables contain fibre, so the more of them your child eats, and the more water they drink, the less likely they are to become constipated. </p> <p>Certain fruits seem to have a particularly strong laxative effect, including figs, dates, apricots, papayas, prunes, rhubarb and soft fruits, such as plums. A small portion of fig and apricot pur\u00e9e can soon get the bowel going, and a little fruit pur\u00e9e can be given to children as young as four months old - as long as they've been cooked first to soften them. Dried fruits can be also be pur\u00e9ed as long as they have been soaked first and mixed with yogurt, added to fruit smoothies or served as an accompaniment to ice cream. You could also give your child a small glass of prune juice every day; either on its own or mixed with freshly squeezed orange juice. If your child is fussy about eating chunks of vegetables, try disguising them in pasta sauces, perhaps pur\u00e9eing tomato sauce with aubergines, carrots, onions and peppers. </p> <p>Cereals and pulses are also good sources of fibre, so try sneaking some chickpeas into home-made soups or chicken rissoles, filling jacket potatoes with baked beans or encouraging them to dip cucumber or carrot batons into a small bowl of hummus. Make toast soldiers with wholegrain bread, but as with all fibres, it's important not to overdo the fibre, at the expense of other valuable foods. </p> <p>Some children are allergic to, or intolerant of, wheat or dairy produce. If you suspect your child becomes constipated after eating a specific type of food, keep a food diary for a couple of weeks and also record when they go to the loo and whether - and, if so, when - they have a stomach ache, headache or any other symptom. Having analysed the food diary, if you think you can see a pattern, give your child less of the suspect food, and if this strategy has positive results, ask your doctor to refer you to a paediatric dietician for advice on how best to balance your child's diet. </p> <p>If, having tried the above tips, your child still remains constipated, visit your doctor, who may prescribe a mild laxative. Don't abandon my nutritional advice, however, because the more you can help to relieve your child's constipation through food, the less they will rely on laxative drugs. Above all, remember to be relaxed about your child's eating and toilet habits. Uptight children are likely to develop bowel problems, so the more you can do to calm them down, the fewer problems you'll all experience. <br><br> Jane Clarke is a state-registered dietician and author of The Bodyfoods series of books</p>",
  "<p>Peshawar is a rough town. Its bazaars are thick with suppressed violence and its traders rarely smile. Five times a day the call to prayer howls through the air in a clatter of static and guttural vowels. At night the roads rattle with automatic gunfire and it is impossible to tell if there has been a wedding or an assassination. </p> <p>Many people die in Peshawar, violently or otherwise. Nobody chooses to end their days there. No one asks for his ashes to be scattered in the churned mud of the Storytellers Bazaar or from the battlements of the Purana Qila, the old fort. To the west of the city, the Khyber Pass leads up through the dusty, rocky hills of the Hindu Kush towards the border with Afghanistan. When the pollution above the city clears, the hills are sharp against a very blue sky. But they are gritty, sullen mountains and no traveller wants his bones to lie among them. </p> <p>Carlos Mavroleon didn't want to die here. Certainly not in the small, claustrophobic hotel room where they found his heroin-soaked body, on 27 August 1998. Carlos didn't want to die anywhere. Perhaps more than at any other time in his incredible life, Carlos wanted to be alive. </p> <p>He had packed it in to his 40 years. The old Etonian heir to a \u00a3100m fortune, he had been a war correspondent, a Wall Street broker, a lover of glamorous women from glamorous political dynasties (the Kennedys) and from less glamorous ones (the Heseltines). He had been a cool, gimlet-eyed war reporter, blowing off the tension of his assignments in the bars and clubs of Notting Hill. He had commanded a unit of Afghan Mujahideen against the Red Army and had been a bodyguard for a Pakistani tribal chief. And, for most of his adult life, Carlos had been a regular user of speed, coke, Ecstasy, heroin and enough pharmaceutical products to stock a large, if specialised, chemist. </p> <p>But through it all, it seems, he knew what he was doing. Carlos was rarely, if ever, out of control. He pushed it to the edge, looked over - and came back again. And again and again and again. Except in Peshawar on that stinking hot August day two years ago. </p> <p>On 7 August 1998, two massive blasts devastated the American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya and killed more than 200 people. American investigators followed the trail of the bombers from East Africa to Pakistan and on, via Peshawar, into eastern Afghanistan. Thirteen days after the explosions, President Clinton launched 75 cruise missiles against the camps that the CIA believed were run by Osama Bin Laden, the terrorist mastermind supposedly behind the attacks. It was called, slightly optimistically, Operation Infinite Reach, and successfully killed a dozen or so young Pakistanis who were training in the camps as well several blameless old men and a large number of goats. When the missiles went in, I was in Kandahar, a fiercely Islamic city in the desert south of Afghanistan. We heard of the attack at about midnight and I spent much of the night filing to my newspaper. It was only at dawn that I really began to realise the situation. We sat tight in the United Nations compound and listened to the radio and the chanting from the mosque. </p> <p>Feelings ran high in the aftermath of the strike. In Kandahar, it took a long speech from the most senior cleric in the city to stop the mob marching on us. In Kabul, the capital 300 miles to the north, two UN peacekeepers were machine-gunned, one fatally. There were huge demonstrations against the Americans across Pakistan. Reports started circulating in Peshawar that a bounty of $15,000 had been offered by Bin Laden for dead Westerners. </p> <p>Carlos was staying with his family at his father's seaside home in Athens when the missiles went in. He arrived back at his flat in Fulham, west London, to find 12 messages winking at him on the answerphone. Carlos was known to other journalists as a 'shithole specialist'. The worse the war, the deeper the poverty, the nastier the place, the better Carlos liked it. His favourite shithole was Afghanistan. The calls on his answerphone can't have been unexpected. He rang CBS, the American TV network, to accept an assignment for their flagship Sixty Minutes programme. Leslie Cockburn, the producer at CBS, knew him well. 'I can't imagine why you are calling,' he joked when he called her. 'By the way, I have a multiple Afghan visa.' </p> <p>CBS wanted him to get to Peshawar as soon as possible to try to get to the camps. The hardline Taliban militia who ruled much of Afghanistan - including the bit I was stuck in - were not letting any journalists into Afghanistan. To get into the country would mean travelling in disguise. It would be very risky. Even a team of Afghan journalists had been badly beaten up and narrowly escaped execution when they tried the same exercise. But if anyone could pull it off, he could. Carlos called his fianc\u00e9e, a 26-year-old TV researcher who he was due to marry in November, and then rang his father. 'Don't worry, papa, I'll be careful,' he told him. He packed his gear, picked up a $5,000 expenses advance and flew straight out to Pakistan on Emirates first class. He arrived in Peshawar on 23 August and checked into Green's hotel just off the central Saddar Bazaar. He had four days to live. </p> <p> Saddar police station is only a mile from Green's hotel. Ten days after Carlos' death a smiling detective called Nisar Ali Marwat flicked a brown file on to his glass-topped desk and told me to read it. Under a slowly rotating fan, I leafed through the badly typed pages. A heavily moustached sergeant brought sweet, milky tea in stained cups. Another, sitting on a broken chair behind me, played with his handgun while I read, emptying and refilling the magazine with small, snub-nosed bullets. </p> <p>The death certificate was numbered 83/98. It gave the cause of death as 'Heroin poisoning (self)'. The autopsy was conducted at 8am on 28 August by Professor Inayatur Rehman Khalil of the Khyber Medical College, Peshawar. Time of death: between 18 and 24 hours before the time of the autopsy. Carlos's body was fully rigormortised and showed no visible signs of violence. All organs were normal. The face and upper part of the chest were 'livid'. There was a blood-stained discharge from the right nostril. The left arm showed a prick-mark in the ante-cubital region and an insulin syringe contaminated with blood lay beside the body. The syringe tested positive for diacetyl morphine (heroin). Carlos's stomach also tested weakly for diacetyl morphine. There were three small packets of drugs in the room. One, opened, was diacetyl morphine. The second was crude powdered opium. The third was an antihistamine tranquilizer called chlorophenaramine maleate. </p> <p>According to the police statements, Carlos was sitting upright on his bed when he was found, a cigarette between his lips. The bloody syringe was on the coffee table in front of him. There was also a blackened coin. He had died of 'heroin asphyxiation'. </p> <p>A press photograph taken of his body as it was removed from the hotel shows a swarthy, good-looking man with tight, black curly hair that made him look much younger than his 40 years and a lean, muscular body. He was stripped to the waist when he died and was wearing baggy, local-style trousers. </p> <p>Another sheet of paper listed his belongings: satellite phone and spare battery, camera charger, British passport B451472, small video camera, Leatherman-style knife/tool, Sony audio recorder, first-aid kit, Maglite torch, tripod and head, Sony shortwave radio stethoscope, four syringes, duty-free pack of Marlboro Lights, sewing kit, video camera battery packs and charger, two shalwar kameez (local baggy trouser and shirt), white local prayer cap, local leather sandals, Holy Koran (translation), books of Islamic history - four, $1,800 in $100 bills, $2,400 in $50 bills, and 12,265 Pakistani rupees [\u00a3150]. </p> <p>I read the list and looked up at Nisar Ali Marwat. The man behind me had put his pistol away. The tea cups had left oily stains on the glass of his desk. He shrugged. </p> <p> When 'Bluey' Mavroleon said goodbye to his son for the last time he cannot have been too reassured by his promise to be careful. Carlos may have been kind, brave, intelligent and charming. But, by ordinary standards, he was not careful. </p> <p>But then Carlos had never lived by ordinary standards. He was born in April 1958 and grew up in the rarefied air of real high society, not the ersatz Hello! version. His father is a Greek shipping tycoon who was once married to Somerset Maugham's granddaughter Camilla. She eventually left him, when Carlos was three, for Count Freddy Chandon, head of the champagne house Mo\u00ebt et Chandon. Carlos's mother, Giaconda, is Mexican. His brother, Nicky, is married to the filmstar Barbara Carrera. The family fortune is estimated at \u00a3100m. Carlos's address book contained phone numbers for Fawn Hall, the secretary at the heart of the Iran-Contra affair and an old flame, Barbara Streisand and Christina Onassis. He went out with Annabel Heseltine, the journalist daughter of the former deputy prime minister for two years. She wanted to marry him. When it became clear that something awful had happened to Carlos, Ethel Kennedy, wife of Bobby senior, rang the White House to find out exactly what was wrong. </p> <p>In 1979, Bluey inherited the family fortune. Carlos grew up in London's Eaton and Cadogan squares and was sent to Eton but, though he did well, hated it. He started to rebel, at first in the ordinary ways; with left-wing politics, music that his parents wouldn't like, soft drugs and drink. But as ever he soon left the ordinary far behind. At 14, he left his privileged world and signed himself into a London comprehensive. </p> <p>After two years of taking a lot of LSD and indulging in 'industrial scale shoplifting', he told his parents he was going to the southwest of France to stay with friends. There were no phones, he said, so they wouldn't hear from him for at least two weeks. He had calculated that would give him enough time to get free. He planned to head to Burma and smuggle rubies. </p> <p>He got as far as Pakistan. High in the Hindu Kush foothills, close to the border with Afghanistan, in lands that are barely controlled by the current Pakistani administration let alone by the British Raj, Carlos did odd jobs - including bodyguard and labourer, learned to speak the guttural language of the Pashto tribesmen who looked after him and converted to Islam. He never contacted his family. They gave him up for dead. </p> <p>After nearly two years, he returned to Britain and Belgravia, thin, sick and still restless. His family welcomed him back, hopeful that his youthful wanderlust was sated. Carlos worked hard to get his A levels, but played hard, too. He moved from amphetamines and acid to heroin. Before long, he had picked up a serious habit which he never entirely shook. </p> <p>He may have been reckless, but he wasn't stupid. He crammed at Millfield, a top public school, and got a place at Princeton University. Not satisfied with that, he applied to Harvard and, on the strength of a successful interview and a fistful of forged references, got in to read politics. With his money and connections, he was soon mixing with the best of America's East Coast society. He was a favoured guest of the Kennedy clan. He had an affair with Mary Richardson, who later married Bobby Jnr, and a short fling with Fawn Hall. </p> <p>From Harvard he went on to Wall Street. It was the 80s and Carlos, intelligent, well-connected and bold, did well. He lived in Manhattan. He made a lot of money. And spent much of it on cocaine and heroin. </p> <p>And yet it wasn't enough. By 1985, the attractions of his Manhattan lifestyle had palled. He flew to Islamabad - the capital of Pakistan - and drove up to Peshawar. It was then the main headquarters and logistics base for the guerrilla groups. He introduced himself to them and convinced them to take him into Afghanistan. It was his first taste of war. Within months of returning to America he had sold the New York apartment and was on his way back to the sub-continent. He was 26. </p> <p> A canal runs through Peshawar. It is full of refuse and dead animals, but the children play in it anyway. By the banks of the canal, in a bungalow set back behind high walls and a courtyard, is the Afghan Media Resource Centre (AMRC). Throughout the Afghan war, it funded journalists' trips into Afghanistan and disseminated the material they collected. It is widely believed to have been set up and supported by the CIA. Carlos used to sleep on its floor between trips 'inside'. </p> <p>One of the films they have at the AMRC was taken in June 1988 near the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad. I watched it an hour or so after reading through the police report on Carlos's death. A keen young Afghan projected it on to the only wall not covered in pictures of blown up tanks, dead guerrillas or Russian soldiers, burned out villages and downed helicopters. </p> <p>First the camera pans across a field full of Mujahideen fighters. They are waiting to go into action, squatting with their weapons in lines in the sun or standing in the shade of trees. In the background are the mountains typical of eastern Afghanistan. The film flickers, jumps and weaves. A bearded, grinning Carlos appears. </p> <p>'My name is Karimullah,' he says, his voice deep and unaccented. He is wearing the pakol - the beret-like woollen cap of northern Pakistan and Afghanistan - and has four curved magazines and an AK47 slung across his shoulders. He is a head taller than everyone else. His new name means 'blessed by God'. </p> <p>'I am a Mujahideen,' he continues. 'We are making an attack today on the city of Jalalabad. All the Mujahideen commanders have come together for this attack. I am very happy and proud to be with my Mujahideen brothers. Allahu Akbar. God is great.' Karimullah then continues in fluent Pashto. 'I am from London. In London I fought the Jihad with a pen. Now I fight it with a sword. I have come to Afghanistan to take part in the Jihad.' </p> <p>The cameraman asks if when the Jihad is over Carlos/Karimullah will bring his family to Afghanistan. 'Inshallah [God willing],' he replies with a broad smile. Carlos had arrived in Peshawar three years previously. At first he had been involved in the political side of the Mujahideen's struggle, handling foreign journalists and visiting American VIPs, but the urge to be physically involved in the action became too strong. By 1988, he was an experienced fighter and, according to former comrades-in-arms, a good one. </p> <p>'When you go into battle, you do what you are told. Karimullah would do whatever he was asked and do it well,' said one former comrade. Several former fighters said that by the end of his time in Afghanistan, Carlos was in charge of a dozen men and was running ambushes by himself. He was always in the thick of any action and even prayed longer and harder than his comrades. One former Mujahideen remembered how Carlos had gone outside for dawn prayers in a freezing gale and had returned wet through. 'We laughed at him when he came back in, but he just said \"Ahumdilallah [God be praised]\", and lay down again.' </p> <p>In 1989, the Soviets pulled out. The war carried on as the guerrillas took on the Moscow-backed government's forces, but Carlos was becoming disillusioned with the infighting among the various groups. It was time to reinvent himself again. He returned to London and within months had metamorphosed into a war correspondent. At the end of his time in Afghanistan he had worked as a cameraman and had shot footage of frontline action. With that, and his languages and charm, the work was soon rolling in. In 1991, he was in Oman trying to sneak, in disguise, into Kuwait during the Gulf War. He failed, but succeeded in getting into northern Iraq a few months later. The next assignment was Somalia, then the Sudan, Burma, Angola, Rwanda and back to Afghanistan. On several occasions, he found himself back in Peshawar. Twice he tried and failed to use his connections with the Mujahideen to get access to Osama Bin Laden. </p> <p>In the early 90s, he made a number of trips to Somalia for the American networks. Tim Deagle, a journalist who had worked with Carlos in East Africa, said their time together had revealed Carlos as 'a seriously good human being'. 'Despite everything we saw - and we saw hundreds of dead bodies in a day - he never lost his compassion. We went into one village and there were about three people left uninjured and he went around giving out first aid and looking after people. Most would have just taken their pictures and left.' </p> <p>Yet there was a spirit of recklessness in Carlos, a flamboyance, that seemed never to die. Deagle remembered his colleague insisted on a lunch-stop during a particularly chaotic moment during the fighting. 'He had found two lobsters, so we stopped in a field hospital with an army withdrawing around us and cooked them up and ate them with bayonets.' </p> <p>On another occasion, Deagle found Carlos standing on top of a jeep with a pistol in his hand, a huge stack of dollars in the other and a crowd of angry Somali gunmen around him. 'NBC and ABC had asked him to pay off the people they had hired for protection. Carlos told them all they had to pray before he would pay them. You or I would have been executed on the spot, but he got away with it. He always did.' </p> <p>In between trips, he had a number of relationships - 'women just flocked to him' according to his brother - and took a lot of cocaine. He spent time in the clubs and bars of Chelsea and Notting Hill. He read dozens of books, usually classics, and read and re-read TE Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom . He wrote book reviews for the Literary Review . Almost always he managed to keep his addiction hidden. Colleagues who he worked with closely for years never saw him take drugs. There are hints though that he did. Several people in Peshawar told me that he had got into an argument with an Afghan journalist after smoking heroin in Jalalabad. It was in 1996 after a second failed attempt to find Bin Laden. It seems Carlos didn't cope with disappointment well. </p> <p> Green's hotel is gloomy and claustrophobic. Poor backpackers and wealthy Pakistanis stay there, not journalists working for American networks. Carlos's room cost \u00a38 a night and was on the third floor facing east. From its small window there was a view of tangled electricity wires and roofs. </p> <p>Carlos arrived in Peshawar on the evening of Sunday 23 August. He dumped his bags and walked a hundred or so yards to the office of The News - a local paper - to catch up with Rahimullah Yusufzai, a Pathan reporter who knows everyone and everything. If Osama Bin Laden wants to talk to the Western world he gives a statement to Rahimullah. So do the Taliban. </p> <p>Rahimullah knew Carlos from the time of the Afghan war and was generous with his advice. He was happy to talk over the various ways to get to the bombed camps, even though he was trying to work out how to reach them himself. Yusufzai told Carlos what he must have suspected: that his only chance was to disguise himself as a local and work his way through the mountains and across the border. The best place to try, Rahimullah said, was from the small town of Miram Shah which is only a score or so miles from the camps themselves. The next day Carlos hired a car - a big Toyota pick-up - and a driver and set off. By nightfall he was at Bannu, a dusty town on the edge of the mountains, by late afternoon on the next day he was in Miram Shah itself. </p> <p>Within hours he was picked up by Pakistani intelligence services. It was the evening of Tuesday the 25th. Though the Pakistani spooks didn't touch him, they scared him. The whole of the country was jittery after the strikes and the intelligence services were more jumpy than anyone. Despite his credentials, he must have had a hard job convincing his interrogators of his true identity and purpose. After a tense and sleepless night he was put on a bus back to Peshawar. As he was not found to be in the possession of heroin when picked up on Tuesday evening, it is fair to assume that he bought the drug after his release from custody. </p> <p>Around 7.30pm the next day, Cockburn, his producer, began calling Carlos's satellite phone. It rang out every time. By the evening, she was very anxious. She called Green's and was told that Carlos had his key and was in his room which was locked. She kept trying the sat'phone. Eventually the hotel staff used a master key to open the door of the room. Carlos was dead on the bed. He had died a few hours earlier. </p> <p> I arrived in Peshawar on the day Carlos died. After three days stuck in the UN compound while the authorities tried to restrain angry mobs in the streets we were finally evacuated by the UN back to Pakistan and I had driven up to Peshawar to cover the story of the missile strikes' fall-out from there. After only a few hours in the city, a local newspaper editor, Faisal Quazi, called me on my mobile to ask if I knew anything about the dead British cameraman. </p> <p>That evening, Peter Jouvenal, a veteran cameraman who knew Carlos from the days of the Afghan war, mentioned over a drink that the dead man had been to Eton. Suddenly everyone wanted an answer to the same question: how did a man with so much end up dying in such a mean and sordid way? Two year's on there is still no good answer. And, as a result, though the authorities have officially closed the file, there are many who believe that the bald facts of the police report and the post-mortem are concealing something more sinister. </p> <p>One thing everyone seems to agree on is that Carlos would have been unlikely to have accidentally overdosed. Nicky Mavroleon pointed out that his brother was an experienced drug user. 'Carlos used to tell me that to him it was like having a drink. When he was having a good time he just wanted to get high... but he always knew what he was doing,' he said. Carlos did have a doctorate in drugs and he was far from unused to the vagaries of the local Peshawar heroin. </p> <p>Also, everyone seems to agree Carlos had not injected for years. Not since 1993 according to his doctor. He had been put off by a friend dying of Aids some years before, his father said. Would he suddenly switch back to syringes? Particularly if, as the police suggest, he had already been smoking the drug. </p> <p>Could he have committed suicide? Rahimullah Yusufzai saw him shortly before he died and said that though he was shaken by his ordeal at the hands of the intelligence men he was not too worried. A CNN cameraman who bumped into him in a Peshawar street later that day said, with no pun intended, that he 'seemed full of beans, really on a high'. </p> <p>'He told us how he had been in prison and seemed to think that it was all very amusing,' the cameraman said. 'He had a cutting from a local paper that said that he was a British spy which he said he was going to have framed.' </p> <p>Everybody who knew him said he was planning to settle down and was as happy as he had ever been. He was to marry in the autumn and was, according to his father, 'devoted' to his fianc\u00e9e. He had also never entirely lost his Muslim faith and in Islam suicide is as great a sin as it is in Catholicism. </p> <p>And it seems strange that he would be taking drugs at all. As an old south Asian hand, he must have known that, at least following his arrest, he would almost certainly be under surveillance? Would he have bought the heroin anyway? So would an experienced drug-user make a major mistake using a method he had given up at a time of his life when more than anything he wanted to be clean and happy? </p> <p>The answer has to be yes. If the suicide scenario is rejected, as it has to be, and the accidental overdose explanation is thrown out too, you are left with nothing but half-baked conspiracy theories. We know that he was tailed throughout his stay in Peshawar and that Green's hotel staff were interrogated by intelligence men both before and after his death. And we know that he was suspected of being a spy. And we can assume the intelligence services, who were tailing him, knew he had bought drugs. But Peshawar breeds conspiracy theories. The basic fact is that there are easier ways to kill someone than making them inject themselves with a deadly syringe. You have to apply Occam's Razor. What is more plausible - an accidental suicide or a plot involving spooks and forced overdoses? In the end, all that you are left with is a grieving family, a brown file on a police chief's desk, a dozen badly typed sheets of paper and the pathologist's 'Heroin poisoning (self)'. The most likely scenario is that a bitterly disappointed Carlos turned to the stand-by which had always helped him when he was feeling low. Relatives say that despite his amazing life he actually had very low self-esteem. The heroin was a prop when he felt down.</p> <p> And that afternoon in Peshawar the disappointment must have been acute. He desperately wanted the assignment to work. To have got the footage from the camps would have made him a media star. He was 40, wanted children, wanted to settle down and wanted some conventional respect from his more conventional peers. And having, in the last few years, watched reporters like Carlos working in Iraq, in Sierra Leone, in half a dozen other such places, I have seen, and felt the sense of heroic difference, the adolescent joy at your distance from the nine-to-five, from the office, from the suits. Heroin gives you that distance, too. If, when he returned to Green's hotel, Carlos momentarily lacked it he wouldn't for long. To start with he would have felt a mellow, sleepy high as the drug triggered the release of dopamine in his brain. It is quite likely that, if he started off smoking the drug, he would welcome the rush of an injection straight into the bloodstream. If you haven't been using the drug for a while the rush is, one regular heroin user tells me, intensified. A wave of contentment overcomes you. Things stop mattering. For Carlos, by the late afternoon of 27 August 1998, as the towers of Peshawar's mosques stretched their shadows across the superheated roofs of the city and the loudspeakers crackled into the Maghreb prayer, nothing mattered at all. </p> <p>I left Pakistan earlier this year. Every week I get calls from old friends and contacts in Peshawar and Islamabad. Recently, I have been asking if anything new has turned up on Carlos's death. People have forgotten it now, and these days I am offered friendly advice rather than information. 'Let sleeping ghosts lie,' said one police officer I know. </p> <p>If Carlos has a ghost it is unlikely to be sleeping.</p>",
  "<p>Submission is making a come-back. 'We scrub your floors the old-fashioned way,' boasts the brochure from Merry Maids, the largest of the residential-cleaning services that have sprung up in America in the past two decades, 'on our hands and knees.' </p> <p>Recently, I spent three weeks as an employee of The Maids International in Portland, Maine, cleaning, along with my fellow team members, approximately 60 houses containing a total of about 250 scrubbable floors - bathrooms, kitchens and entryways requiring the hands-and-knees treatment.</p> <p> It's a different world down there below knee level, one that few adults voluntarily enter. Here you find elaborate dust structures held together by a scaffolding of dog hair; dried bits of pasta glued to the floor by their sauce; the congealed remains of gravies, jellies, contraceptive creams, vomit and urine. Sometimes, too, you encounter some fragment of a human being: a child's legs, stamping by in disgust because the cleaner is still there when he gets home from school; more commonly, the electrolysed calves of the female homeowner. Look up and you may find this person staring at you, arms folded, in anticipation of an overlooked stain.</p> <p> In rare instances she may try to help in some vague way or apologise for the leaves shed by a miniature indoor tree. Mostly, though, she will not see you at all and may even sit down with her post at a table in the room you are cleaning, where she would remain unaware of your existence unless you were to crawl under that table and start gnawing away at her ankles. </p> <p>Housework, as you may recall from the feminist theories of the 60s and 70s, was supposed to be the great equaliser of women. Whatever else women did, we also did housework. If men thought of the home as a site of leisure and recreation - a 'haven in a heartless world' - this was to ignore the invisible female proletariat that kept it cosy and humming. We were on the march, or so we imagined, united against a society that devalued our labour even as it waxed mawkish over 'the family' and 'the home'. </p> <p>We railed against husbands and boyfriends who refused to pick up after themselves, who were unaware of housework at all, unless of course it hadn't been done. Wherever second-wave feminism took root, battles broke out between lovers and spouses over sticky countertops, piled-up laundry, and whose turn it was to do the dishes. The radical new idea was that housework was not only a relationship between a woman and a Hoover or an unmade bed; it also defined a relationship between human beings, typically husbands and wives. Hence the feminist perception of housework as one more way by which men exploit women. </p> <p>We rejected the servant option. There already were at least two able-bodied adults in the average home - a man and a woman - and the hope was that, after a few initial skirmishes, they would learn to share the housework graciously. </p> <p>A couple of decades later, however, the average household still falls far short of that goal. True, women do almost half the amount of housework they did before the feminist revolution and the rise of the two-income family - a decline that reflects a relaxation of standards rather than a redistribution of chores. Yet women still do two-thirds of whatever housework - including bill paying, pet care, tidying and lawn care - gets done. The inequity is sharpest for the most despised of household chores, cleaning: in the 30 years between 1965 and 1995, American men increased the time they spent scrubbing, vacuuming, and sweeping by 240 per cent - all the way up to 1.7 hours per week - while women decreased their cleaning time by only 7 per cent, to 6.7 hours per week. In the UK, a survey of British parents in 1996 revealed fathers spend an average of two hours cleaning per week, compared to 13.25 hours by mothers. </p> <p>These averages conceal a variety of arrangements, of course, from minutely negotiated sharing to the most clich\u00e9d division of labour, as described by one woman I heard of, who recently said: 'I take care of the inside, he takes care of the outside.' But perhaps the most disturbing finding is that almost the entire increase in male participation took place between the 70s and the mid-80s. Fifteen years after the apparent cessation of hostilities, it is probably not too soon to announce the score: in the 'chore wars' of the 70s and 80s, women gained a little ground, but overall, and after a few strategic concessions, men won. </p> <p>Enter then, the cleaning lady. Marriage counsellors recommend her as an alternative to squabbling, as do many within the cleaning industry itself. A cleaning woman quotes one of her clients as saying that if she gives up the service, 'My husband and I will be divorced in six months.' </p> <p> When the trend toward hiring out was just beginning to take off, in 1988, the owner of a Merry Maids franchise in Arlington, Massachusetts, said: 'I kid some women. I say, \"We even save marriages. In this new 80s period, you expect more from the male partner, but very often you don't get the co-operation you would like to have. The alternative is to pay somebody to come in...\"' Another Merry Maids franchise owner has learned to capitalise more directly on housework-related spats: he closes a third of his sales by making follow-up calls Saturday mornings, which is 'prime time for arguing over the fact that the house is a mess'. The micro-defeat of feminism in the household opened a new door for women - only this time it was the servants' entrance. </p> <p>The cleaning industry is booming. Among my middle-class, professional-women friends and acquaintances, including some who made important contributions to the early feminist analysis of housework, the employment of a maid is now nearly universal. Strangely, or perhaps not so strangely, no one talks about the 'politics of housework' any more. The demand for 'wages for housework' has sunk to the status of a curio. Among feminist sociologists, housework has lost much of its former cachet - in part, I suspect, because fewer sociologists actually do it. The home, or at least the affluent home, is finally becoming what radical feminists in the 70s only imagined it was - a true 'workplace' for women and a tiny, though increasingly visible, part of the capitalist economy. And the question is: as the home becomes a workplace for someone else, is it still a place where you would want to live? </p> <p>The 'cleaning boom' is concentrated among chains such as Merry Maids, Molly Maids, Mini Maids, Maid Brigade, and The Maids International - all named, curiously enough, to highlight the more antique aspects of the industry, though the 'maid' may occasionally be male. These corporate cleaning services have abolished the mistress-maid relationship. The customer hires the service, not the maid, who has been replaced by a team of two to four uniformed people, only one of whom - the team leader - is usually authorised to speak to the customer. The maids' wages, their taxes, their backaches, and childcare problems are all the concern of the company, meaning the local franchise owner. If there are complaints on either side, they are addressed to the franchise owner; the customer and the actual workers need never interact. Since the franchise owner is usually a middle-class white person, cleaning services are the ideal solution for anyone still sensitive enough to find the traditional employer-maid relationship morally vexing. </p> <p>Dan Libby, my boss at The Maids, confided to me that he could double his business overnight if only he could find enough reliable employees. To this end, The Maids offers a week's paid vacation, health insurance after 90 days and a free breakfast every morning consisting of coffee, doughnuts, bagels and bananas. Some franchises have dealt with the tight labour market by participating in welfare-to-work projects that not only funnel employees to them but often subsidise their paycheques with public money, at least for the first few months of work (which doesn't mean that the newly minted maid earns more, only that the company has to pay her less). The Merry Maids franchise in the city where I worked is conveniently located a block away from the city's welfare office. </p> <p>Among the women I worked with at The Maids, only one said she had previously worked as an independent, and she professed to be pleased with her new status as a cleaning-service employee. She no longer needed a car to get her from house to house and could take a day off - unpaid, of course - to stay home with a sick child without risking the loss of a customer. I myself could see the advantage of not having to deal directly with the customers, who were sometimes at home while we worked and eager to make use of their supervisory skills: criticisms of our methods, and demands that we perform unscheduled tasks, could simply be referred to the franchise owner. </p> <p>But there are inevitable losses for the workers as any industry moves from the entrepreneurial to the industrial phase, probably most strikingly, in this case, in the matter of pay. At Merry Maids, I was promised $200 for a 40-hour week, the manager hastening to add that 'you can't calculate it in dollars per hour' since the 40 hours include all the time spent travelling from house to house - up to five houses a day - which is unpaid. The Maids International, with its straightforward starting rate of $6.63 an hour, seemed preferable, though this rate was conditional on perfect attendance. Miss one day and your wage dropped to $6 an hour for two weeks, a rule that weighed particularly heavily on those who had young children. </p> <p>In addition, I soon learned that management had ways of shaving off nearly an hour's worth of wages a day. We were told to arrive at 7.30am, but our billable hours began only after we had been teamed up, given our list of houses for the day, and packed off in the company car at about 8am. At the end of the day, we were no longer paid from the moment we left the car, though as much as 15 minutes of work - refilling cleaning-fluid bottles, etc - remained to be done. So for a standard nine-hour day, the actual pay amounted to about $6.10 an hour, unless you were still being punished for an absence, in which case it came out to $5.50 an hour. </p> <p>Nor are cleaning-service employees likely to receive any of the perks or tips familiar to independents - free lunches and coffee, cast-off clothing or a Christmas gift of cash. When I asked, only one of my co-workers could recall ever receiving a tip, and that was a voucher for a free meal at a downtown restaurant owned by a customer. The customers of cleaning services are probably no stingier than the employers of independents; they just don't know their cleaning people and probably wouldn't even recognise them on the street. Plus, customers probably assume that the fee they pay the service - $25 per person-hour, in the case of The Maids franchise - goes largely to the workers who do the actual cleaning. </p> <p> The most interesting feature of the cleaning- service chains, at least from an abstract, historical perspective, is that they are finally transforming the home into a fully capitalist-style workplace, and in ways that the old wages-for-housework advocates could never have imagined. A house is an innately difficult workplace to control, especially a house with 10 or more rooms like so many of those we cleaned; workers may remain out of one another's sight for as much as an hour at a time. For independents, the ungovernable nature of the home-as-workplace means a certain amount of autonomy. They can take breaks (though this is probably ill-advised if the homeowner is on the premises); they can ease the monotony by listening to the radio or TV while they work. </p> <p>But cleaning services lay down rules meant to enforce a factorylike - or even conventlike - discipline on their far-flung employees. At The Maids, there were no breaks except for a daily 10-minute stop at a convenience store for coffee or 'lunch' - meaning something like a slice of pizza. Otherwise, the time spent driving between houses was considered our 'break' and the only chance to eat, drink or (although this was also officially forbidden) smoke a cigarette. When the houses were spaced well apart, I could eat my sandwich in one sitting; otherwise it would have to be divided into as many as three separate, hasty snacks. </p> <p>In a customer's house, nothing was to touch our lips at all, not even water - a rule that, on hot days, I sometimes broke by drinking from a bathroom tap. TVs and radios were off-limits, and we were never, ever, to curse out loud, even in an ostensibly deserted house. There might be a homeowner secreted in some locked room, we were told, ear pressed to the door, or, more likely, a tape recorder or video camera running. At the time, I dismissed this as a scare story, but I have since come across ads for devices like the Tech-7 'incredible coin-sized camera' designed to 'get a visual record of your babysitter's actions' and 'watch employees to prevent theft'. It was the threat or rumour of hidden recording devices that provided the final capitalist-industrial touch: supervision. </p> <p>What makes the work most factory-like, though, is the intense regimen imposed by the companies. An independent, or a person cleaning his or her own home, chooses where she will start and, in each room, probably tackles the most egregious dirt first. Or she may plan her work more or less ergonomically, first doing whatever can be done from a standing position and then crouching to reach the lower levels. But with the special 'systems' devised by the cleaning services and imparted to employees via training videos, there are no such decisions to make. </p> <p> <strong> In The Maids' 'healthy touch' system, which is </strong> similar to what I saw of the Merry Maids' system on the training tape I was shown during my interview, all cleaning is divided into four task areas - dusting, vacuuming, kitchens, and bathrooms - which are in turn divided among the team members. For each task area other than vacuuming, there is a bucket containing appropriate cleaning fluids, so the biggest decision an employee has to make is which fluid and scrubbing instrument to deploy on which kind of surface; almost everything else has been choreographed in advance. When vacuuming, you begin with the master bedroom; when dusting, with the first room off the kitchen; then you move through the rooms, going left to right. When entering each room, you proceed from left to right and top to bottom, and the same with each surface - top to bottom, left to right. </p> <p>Deviations are subject to rebuke, as I discovered when a team leader caught me moving my arm from right to left, then left to right, while wiping Windex over a French door. It's not easy for anyone with extensive cleaning experience - and I include myself in this category - to accept this loss of autonomy. But I came to love the system. First, because if you hadn't always been travelling rigorously from left to right it would have been easy to lose your way in some of the larger houses and omit or redo a room. Second, some of the houses were already clean when we started, at least by any normal standards, thanks probably to a housekeeper who kept things up between our visits - but the absence of visible dirt did not mean there was less work to do, for no surface could ever be neglected, so it was important to have 'the system' to remind you of where you had been and what you had already 'cleaned'. </p> <p>No doubt the biggest advantage of the system, though, is that it helps you achieve the speed demanded by the company, which allots only so many minutes per house. After a week or two on the job, I found myself moving robotlike from surface to surface, grateful to have been relieved of the thinking process. </p> <p>The irony, which I was often exhausted enough to derive a certain malicious satisfaction from, is that 'the system' is not very sanitary. When I saw the training videos on 'Kitchens' and 'Bathrooms', I was at first baffled, and it took me several minutes to realise why: there is no water, or almost no water, involved. I had been taught to clean by my mother, a compulsive housekeeper who employed water so hot you needed rubber gloves to get into it and in such Niagara-like quantities that most microbes were probably crushed by the force of it before the soap suds had a chance to rupture their cell walls. </p> <p>But germs are never mentioned in the videos provided by The Maids. Our antagonists existed entirely in the visible world - soap scum, dust, counter crud, dog hair, stains and smears - and were attacked by damp rag or, in hardcore cases, by a scouring pad. We scrubbed only to remove impurities that might be detectable to a customer by hand or by eye; otherwise our only job was to wipe. Nothing was ever said, in the videos or in person, about the possibility of transporting bacteria from bathroom to kitchen or even from one house to the next. </p> <p>Instead, it is the 'cosmetic touches' that the videos emphasise and to which my trainer continually directed my eye. Fluff out all throw-pillows and arrange them symmetrically. Brighten up stainless-steel sinks with baby oil. Leave all spice jars, shampoos, etc, with their labels facing outward. Comb out the fringes of Persian carpets with a pick. Use the vacuum to create a special, fernlike pattern in the carpets. The loose ends of loo paper and paper towel rolls have to be given a special fold. Finally, the house is sprayed with the service's signature air freshener - a cloying floral scent. </p> <p>When I described the 'methods' employed to cleaning expert Cheryl Mendelson, she was incredulous. A rag moistened with disinfectant will not get a countertop clean, she told me, because most disinfectants are inactivated by contact with organic matter - ie, dirt - so their effectiveness declines with each swipe of the rag. What you need is a detergent and hot water, followed by a rinse. As for floors, she judged the amount of water we used - one half of a small bucket - to be grossly inadequate, and, in fact, the water I wiped around on floors was often an unsavoury gray. </p> <p>Yet the point at The Maids, apparently, is not to clean so much as it is to create the appearance of having been cleaned, not to sanitise but to create a kind of stage setting for family life. And the stage setting Americans seem to prefer is sterile only in the metaphorical sense, like a motel room or the fake interiors in which soap operas take place. </p> <p> But even ritual work takes its toll on those assigned to perform it. Turnover is dizzyingly high in the cleaning-service industry, and not only because of the usual challenges that confront the working poor: childcare problems, unreliable transportation, evictions, and prior health problems. As my long-winded interviewer at Merry Maids warned me, and my co-workers at The Maids confirmed, this is a physically punishing occupation, something to tide you over for a few months, not year after year. The hands-and-knees posture damages knees, with or without pads; vacuuming strains the back; constant wiping and scrubbing invite repetitive-strain injuries even in the very young. </p> <p>In my three weeks as a maid, I suffered nothing more than a persistent muscle spasm in the right forearm, but the damage would have been far worse if I'd had to go home every day to my own housework and children, as most of my co-workers did, instead of returning to my motel and indulging in a daily after-work regimen of ice packs and stretches. Chores that seem effortless at home, even almost recreational, quickly turn nasty when performed hour after hour, with few or no breaks and under relentless time pressure. </p> <p>So far, the independent, entrepreneurial housecleaner is holding her own, but there are reasons to think that corporate cleaning services will eventually dominate the industry. New users often prefer the impersonal, standardised service offered by the chains. The trend toward outsourcing the work of the home seems, at the moment, unstoppable. For a fee, new firms will also pick up dry cleaning, babysit pets, buy groceries, deliver dinner, even do the Christmas shopping. With other firms and individuals offering to buy your clothes, organise your financial files, and wait around in your home for the plumber to show up, why would anyone want to hold on to the toilet cleaning? </p> <p>Barring a major souring of the economy, there is every reason to think that we will become increasingly reliant on paid housekeepers and that this reliance will extend ever further down into the middle class. For one thing, the 'time bind' on working parents shows no sign of loosening: people are willing to work longer hours at the office to pay for the people - housecleaners and baby-sitters - who are filling in for them at home. </p> <p>Another trend impels people to hire outside help: fewer Americans know how to clean or even to 'straighten up'. I hear this from professional women defending their decision to hire a maid: 'I'm just not very good at it myself', or 'I wouldn't really know where to begin.' Since most of us learn to clean from our parents (usually our mothers), any diminution of cleaning skills is transmitted from one generation to another. Upper-middle-class children raised in the servant economy of the 90s are bound to grow up as domestically incompetent as their parents and no less dependent on people to clean up after them. Having cleaned the rooms of many overly privileged teenagers in my stint with The Maids, I've come to the conclusion that the American overclass is raising a generation of young people who will, without constant assistance, suffocate in their own detritus. </p> <p>Almost everything we buy is the product of some other person's suffering and miserably underpaid labour. I clean my own house (though I have to admit I recently hired someone else to ready it for a short-term tenant), but I can hardly claim purity in any other area of consumption. I buy my jeans at shops which are reputed to subcontract to sweatshops. I tend to favour decorative objects no doubt ripped off from scantily paid Third World craftspersons. Like everyone else, I eat salad greens just picked by migrant farm workers, some of them possibly children. So why should housework - as I have found in conversations with liberal-minded employers of maids - arouse any special angst? </p> <p>Perhaps because we all sense that there are ways in which housework is different from other products and services. First, in its inevitable proximity to the activities that compose 'private' life. The home that becomes a workplace for other people remains a home, even when that workplace has been minutely regulated by the corporate cleaning chains. Someone who has no qualms about purchasing rugs woven by child slaves in India or coffee picked by impoverished peasants in Guatemala might still hesitate to tell dinner guests that, surprisingly enough, his or her lovely home doubles as a sweatshop during the day. You can eschew the chain-cleaning services, of course, hire an independent cleaner at a generous hourly wage, and even encourage, at least in spirit, the unionisation of the house-cleaning industry. But this does not change the fact that someone is working in your home at a job she would almost certainly never have chosen for herself - if she'd had a college education, for example, or a little better luck along the way - and the place where she works, however enthusiastically or resentfully, is the same as the place where you sleep. </p> <p>It is also the place where your children are raised, and what they learn pretty quickly is that some people are less worthy than others. Even better wages and working conditions won't erase the hierarchy between an employer and his or her domestic help, because the help is usually there only because the employer has 'something better' to do with her time, as one report on the growth of cleaning services puts it, not noticing the obvious implication that the cleaning person herself has nothing better to do with her time. In a merely middle-class home, the message may be reinforced by a warning to the children that that's what they'll end up doing if they don't try harder in school. Housework, as radical feminists once proposed, defines a human relationship and, when unequally divided among social groups, reinforces pre-existing inequalities. Dirt, in other words, tends to attach to the people who remove it. Or, as cleaning entrepreneur Don Aslett told me with some bitterness - and this is a successful man, chairman of the board of an industrial cleaning service and frequent television guest: 'The whole mentality out there is that if you clean, you're a scumball.' </p> <p> To be cleaned up after is to achieve a certain magical weightlessness and immateriality. Almost everyone complains about violent video games, but paid housecleaning has the same consequence-abolishing effect: you blast the villain into a mist of blood droplets and move right along; you drop the socks knowing they will eventually levitate, laundered and folded, back to their normal dwelling place. The result is a kind of virtual existence, in which the trail of litter that follows you seems to evaporate all by itself. Spill syrup on the floor and the cleaning person will scrub it off when she comes on Tuesday. Leave the newspaper scattered around your airplane seat and the flight attendants will deal with it after you've deplaned. Spray toxins into the atmosphere from your factory's chimneys and they will be filtered out eventually by the lungs of the breathing public. A servant economy breeds callousness and solipsism in the served, and it does so all the more effectively when the service is performed close up and routinely in the place where they live and reproduce. </p> <p>In a more generous social order, housekeeping services would be subsidised for those who have health-related reasons to need them - the old or infirm, for example. This would generate new jobs for the low-skilled people who now clean the homes of the affluent. And in a less gender-divided social order, husbands and boyfriends would more readily do their share of the chores. </p> <p>The moral challenge is, put simply, to make work visible again: not only the scrubbing and vacuuming but all the hoeing, hammering, drilling and lifting that goes into creating and maintaining a livable habitat. In an ever more economically unequal culture, where so many of the affluent devote their lives to such ghostly pursuits as stock trading, image making and opinion polling, real work - in the old-fashioned sense of labour that engages hand as well as eye, that tires the body and directly alters the physical world - tends to vanish from sight. </p> <p>The feminists of my generation tried to bring some of it into the light of day, but, like busy women fleeing the house in the morning, they left the project unfinished, the debate broken off in mid-sentence, the noble intentions unfulfilled. Sooner or later, someone else will have to finish the job.</p>",
  "Nowhere is western culture more baffling than in matters of body weight. From modern medicine, the caveats have come thick and fast. In 1997, the World Health Organisation declared a global epidemic of obesity. European health experts convened in May this year in Antwerp to call for action in order to prevent a 'lost generation' of children hooked on fast foods, television and computers from developing diabetes, heart disease and cancer. In July, the Medical Research Council cautioned MPs that unless efforts were made to cut obesity, the Government's targets to reduce these diseases wouldn't be met. <br> The codicils from this quarter don't help: the BMA announced in June that actresses and models during the late-1990s carried a scant 10 to 15 per cent body fat (the average for healthy women is 20 to 26 per cent), concluding that such exposure to 'unachievable' goals could spur eating disorders, and adding that 'more realistic body shapes need to be shown on TV and in fashion magazines'. Be slim to be healthy. Don't be too slim to be socially acceptable. And all you need to be slim is fat, sugar and calories. That was the message in that commercial for H\u00e4agen-Dazs in which a twentysomething man and woman made love on a sofa, mingling heaping spoonfuls of Pralines &amp; Cream with the wettest of French kisses. Sex. Youth. Beauty. Ice cream? The incongruity didn't end there. The lovers are skeletons, an unlikely couple to imagine opting for a tub at the check-out counter.   I was 10 years old when I learned I was overweight. We had recently moved to London, and my mother ordered some custom-made suits for me from a tailor in Hong Kong, who specialised in mail-order finery. She sent the measurements along and, when the clothes arrived, there was a greeting from the tailor. The faltering English did little to soften its thrust: 'These are suits for your fat son. We made them special fat so he can grow extra fatty in them.' There was mild horror laced with hearty laughter at the dinner table that night.   Suddenly - and perhaps too early for my benefit - the 'big' issue was upon me. I've had to contend with being overweight for most of my 40 years. On the health side, I've been fortunate. I've suffered none of the scourges associated with the morbidly obese, which (as defined by the medical profession is anyone 100lb over their ideal weight) I gather I am. My yearly check-ups are unremarkable. My weight hasn't been an obstacle to pleasures enjoyed by the ideally trim: women haven't turned me away; I've played a good standard of tennis for 30 years; though buying clothes can be a challenge, in the competition between dessert and dressing up the winner has never been in doubt.   I am the product of a family and culture that lives to eat. My grandfather, who turns 100 in October, claims the source of his extraordinarily good health has been his refusal to eat vegetables or drink water without whisky in it. He has never exercised. His diet has been rich in saturated fats and refined grains and sugars. Despite a slight paunch, his weight has revolved around 12st 7lb for most of his life. Which isn't to say that the body image and health themes haven't been present. In my family, diets were frequently embarked upon between bouts of comprehensive bingeing. On the distaff side, the relationship to food has been ambivalent: one instance of anorexia, another of bulimia and generous helpings of crash dieting and pill popping.   My sisters have unquestionably managed their weight more consistently than I have, whereas my love of food has been singular and unequivocal. My seven years as a restaurant critic in America didn't do me any favours. My wife frets over what my appetite for eating, cooking and obsessing about food does to our time together, which might otherwise be better spent on more beneficial pursuits: she has a point. She worries that there's a limit to how much good genes can help and cautions that I shouldn't ignore my long-term health prospects: she has a point there, too. Meanwhile, my weight had recently ballooned to 21st. An exercise in futility and deprivation - that has been my experience with diets.   The so-called 'hungry high' is an oxymoron. I've tried the Scarsdale Diet, the Rotation Diet, the Atkins Diet, the Pritikin Diet, the Cambridge Diet, even the Beverly Hills Diet - mother of all crazies, truly a child of its time. In 1981, a self-anointed 'nutrition guru' named Judy Mazel theorised that by applying the enzymes in fruit according to her plan, one could lose weight. On a diet of fruit, there was little alternative. Week One's menu consisted of pineapples and two bananas on Monday; papayas and mangoes on Tuesday; papayas, pineapples and more papayas on Wednesday; watermelons all day on Thursday and again on Sunday; two bananas, dried apricots and blueberries on Friday; and prunes, strawberries and two bananas on Saturday. I tried it three times. By the week's end, I was a fruitcake. I never made it to Week Two.   I was 13 when I underwent my first fat-farm experience. My parents had travelled to a hospital in Italy to try a method that was all the rage in the 1970s, and soon after I was enrolled with my older sister. We did it again as a family, with my grandfather in tow, and in protest. I went to Rome no fewer than three times. We were informed that through an injection of a hormone extracted from a pregnant woman's urine, we could lose 21lb in 21 days. The full details were less salubrious. The human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) hormone is secreted by women during the first trimester of pregnancy. Dr A Simeons published a report in 1954 in which he observed how so-called 'fat boys' with adiposogenital dystrophy (a syndrome of undescended testicles) were helped by daily injections of the hormone. For a time, the world watched and some, like us, followed. Simeons was a poor advertisement for his method. He had died of weight-related coronary disease some years prior to my first visit to his centre of operations, Rome's Ospedale Salvatori Mundii. The regime worked insofar as I did lose 21lb. The 500 calorie-per-day diet may have had just a little to do with it.   Perhaps it can never be too emphatically said how, of all cities, Rome should be the last one in which to starve. Misery was the order of each day. A pricking needle in my buttocks was my wake-up call. Breakfast consisted of weak tea or coffee with skimmed milk plus all the saccharine I desired. Lunch was 100gm of meat, chicken or fish - boiled to a pulp - with boiled green vegetables, a single bread stick and a single piece of fruit. Dinner was a repeat of lunch. Water was the only beverage. It was abstinence, Italian-style. A wise move on the hospital's part was to have nuns serve the food, for the urge to physically assault the person serving your food was powerful. I actually fainted on one occasion. The nun gave a glucose tablet and a benediction. There was a silver lining, and it came early: two days before starting, you were encouraged to 'force feed' in order to build up what was enigmatically referred to as 'fat reserve'.   The obvious arguments - one, that we were obese, not geese, and two, that surely there was already more than enough of the latter - were never offered. Instead, we repaired to the most aromatic trattorias in nearby Trastevere and took no prisoners at the table. I should note that hCG has since been completely discredited as a treatment for obesity. Whatever weight was lost was quickly regained, usually with interest. My next big diet-centre experience was in North Carolina's Duke University Medical Centre, which has since become Diet Central for the variety of weight treatments on offer. I sampled the so-called 'rice diet'. It was a fitting appellation: rice for breakfast, rice for lunch and rice for dinner, puffed or boiled, no extras, and above all, with no salt. Patients who attended the 'Rice House' were simply the heaviest people I had ever seen in my life. I felt like a ballet dancer standing next to a fleet of barrage balloons. Some of the very largest had to be lowered like grand pianos down recesses beside staircases in order to help them make it to the dining room. Many were on respirators and the sound of wheezing breezed through the house.   The scene at the swimming pool in neighbouring Duke Towers evoked a lagoon teeming with hippos. I mislaid some 45lb, but soon found them again. The Rice House is still open for business, even on the web: <a href=\"http://www.ricediet.com. The\" target=\"_NEW\">www.ricediet.com. </a>The realm of prescription medication has for the most part been terra incognita . In the 1970s, a well-known doctor in London gave me so-called 'fat-burning' and diuretic pills that had me sweating like an ox and feeling that a heart attack was around the corner. I haven't sampled the new generation. <br>  As for the new miracle pill, Orlistat, let the side-effect literature speak for itself: 'oily spotting, flatulence with discharge, faecal urgency, fatty or oily stool, oily evacuation, increases defecation and faecal incontinence'. 'We have a paradox,' says Dr Robert Lefever, director of the Promis Counselling Centre in London, where compulsions of every type are treated as variants of the same fundamental disorder: addiction. 'Diets don't work,' he says. 'But the only way to lose weight is to diet.' His views can seem contradictory. He sees addiction as a condition best treated by former addicts, not shrinks. He's critical of surgical treatments from the medical world to which he belongs. 'Surgeons have no place in dealing with a psychological problem. There's an awful lot of quackery, such as stomach stapling and gastric bypass.' He isn't kidding.   Hospitals offer a wide menu of grisly procedures designed to put an end to obesity - and much else besides. Two primary bariatric surgical procedures are commonly used: vertical banded gastroplasty and gastric bypass. The genesis of this none-too-modest proposal for weight loss dates back to 1969, when it was noted that near total removal of the stomach for cancer and ulcers caused patients to remain at below their normal weight. The approach involves stapling off most of the stomach, bypassing the duodenum and allowing the undigested food to pass directly into the small intestine. The weight loss occurs as the body adjusts to its new, limited capacity to absorb nutrients, for which vitamin supplements are thereafter widely prescribed. The mortality risks are deemed 'relatively low', though there is a chance of forming adhesions in the bowel, which frequently calls for more surgery.   The aftereffects are a laundry list. My favourite is the 'dumping syndrome'. After surgery, all food is emptied from the stomach pouch into the small intestine. Sweets and fatty foods irritate the small intestine, causing symptoms such as abdominal cramping, sweating, and general malaise. Eating and drinking fluids simultaneously is another way to feel the dumping syndrome; they recommend waiting half an hour between eating and drinking - for the rest of your life. Can the surgery be reversed? Yes, but the risks are greater than those braved the first time. Hippocrates gave us the recipe for weight loss 24 centuries ago - eat less and exercise more - and while for most that still holds true, perhaps it's possible that there's an even better way.   France's Michel Montignac, in his book Eat Yourself Slim, proposes a diet that aims to satisfy the passionate eater and lacks the more usual element of self-denial present in every diet I've ever tried. Rather disarmingly, when I spoke to him recently he said, 'Forget about my book before embarking on a plan, and simply eat the French way, then read my book.' Montignac, formerly obese, now trim but still a foodie, advocates eating well, regardless of caloric intake. The way to avoid putting on weight, he claims, is by classifying foods by their glucose content, which causes the body to produce high amounts of insulin to combat it, resulting in obesity. Beer, potatoes, cooked carrots, soft drinks, and pastry are out. Beef, dark chocolate, red wine, foie gras, ice cream are in, along with healthier foods such as wholemeal grains and pasta, pulses, fruit, and green vegetables.   A typical Montignac day begins with either a lipid breakfast or a carbohydrate breakfast. The lipid is less healthy, but acceptable: fried eggs, bacon, tomatoes and mushrooms. The carbohydrate breakfast offers all the wholegrain toast and sugar-free jam you want, plus cereal with skimmed milk. Fruit before any meal must be consumed on an empty stomach, waiting 15 minutes to digest.   Lunch or dinner can be either salad with goat's cheese and fillet of beef with B\u00e9arnaise sauce and saut\u00e9ed vegetables, then cheese for dessert, or brown rice with tomato coulis, salad with cottage cheese, and low-fat yogurt mixed with fructose jam.

  "<p>The entrance pavilion of the Prince Maurice hotel sits in the middle of a small, artificial lake. Its thatched roof is supported on a skimpily elegant structure of teak logs, deftly lashed together and carefully lit at night to give the internal face of the thatch the delicate texture of a piece of fine, tobacco- coloured silk. </p> <p>There are no walls; a light soaking of tropical rain can be just as enjoyable an experience as a warm breeze. You can sit in a teak chair watching the sky reflected in the tiered infinity pool that merges imperceptibly into the sea. The rest of the hotel, an intricate assembly of moated pavilions on stilts, none of them more than two storeys high, divided by pools and courtyards, is all but invisible in the palms. </p> <p>To all intents, it's a Balinese village, just the kind of sensitive piece of hotel architecture built with a respect for local traditions that should give a certain kind of well-heeled tourism a good name. Or, at least, it would be a piece of respectful and sensitive architecture if this particular hotel actually were in south-east Asia. </p> <p>But it isn't. This is Mauritius, 5,000 miles away, off the east coast of Africa. And the Prince Maurice is a brand-new hotel whose non-specific Asian style has suddenly become as ubiquitous as the modified Bauhaus glass slab used to be. It looks as if it embraces the climate, but it's air-conditioned. It looks green, but it is just as demanding on water and sewage systems as any other kind of hotel. </p> <p>The language of hotel design has a significance way beyond the daily preoccupations of the tourist industry. In the 1960s, the hotel became a kind of national calling card, allowing a country to demonstrate to a captive audience how up to date it was. A glass-slab hotel, like the SAS Palace designed by Arne Jacobsen in 1960, or the vast hotels of Moscow of the same period, were once regarded as being as essential to the apparatus of an ambitious state as a nuclear power station or a steel works. And they managed to look much the same. </p> <p>Now a city state like Dubai feels it has to find ways of suggesting its deep cultural roots architecturally when it builds a high-rise hotel, even when the real point is to demonstrate how sophisticated and modern it is. That schizophrenia is clearly apparent in the architecture of the Burj Al Arab, which tries to have it both ways. It's a skyscraper built on an artificial island linked to the mainland by a causeway that is meant to convince us that Dubai has more to offer than sand and a distant view of oilfields. </p> <p>The architects, WS Atkins, came up with a queasy mixture of a Star Trek baroque structure and a translucent, plastic fa\u00e7ade to provide the local colour. Allegedly, it looks like the sail of a dhow, inflated to a gargantuan 35 storeys. </p> <p>There was a time when hotels did all they could to persuade us we hadn't left home. Now they do all they can to show us how different they are from home and, paradoxically, the effect is to go on making everywhere look the same. Partly, it was because the international style seemed self-evidently right for hotel architecture. Travel was a reflection of the same kind of rootlessness as the international style, an architecture ostensibly without national inflections. </p> <p>But there was also something reassuring about the fact that an international hotel didn't quite belong to its context. Apart from hard-core minimalists, most of us would rather not have to deal with the very particular bathing arrangements of a traditional Japanese ryokan at the end of a long day fighting off jet lag. You know where you are with a Holiday Inn. You can be sure you will find the light switch in the same place on the same wall from Mexico to Belgium, and you can be pretty confident that the lavatory is not going to present too many challenges either. </p> <p>There is a price to pay for reassurance. The Costa del Sol and the Turkish Riviera finished up lined end to end with what looked very much like the council flats and office blocks that their package-holiday occupants had left behind at home in search of a change of scene. </p> <p>Magaluf started to look very much like Mile End, while the Hilton in downtown Istanbul felt much the same as the Hilton at Heathrow or the Hilton in Shinjuku, except for the customised cocktail of the day and the usually sanitised names on the brass tags pinned to the waistcoat lapels of the lobby staff. </p> <p>It was a certain level of guilt about the consequences of all this, together with shrewd commercial calculation about increasingly sophisticated tourists, that triggered the process that eventually led to the arrival of Asia in Africa. </p> <p>Architecture was used to make politically correct hotels that wanted to stop looking like ugly Americans, and tried to become part of the landscape instead. Rather than transplant Western models to the tropics, Adrian Zecha, founder of the Aman hotels group, tried to use authentic indigenous architecture to build hotels that looked as if they belonged. Amanpuri was the first, opened in 1988 in Phuket, and was instantly successful. Zecha's architect, Ed Tuttle, developed a style that quickly spread from Thailand to Bali, Java, the Philippines and eventually reaching not just Mauritius but even the outskirts of Marrakesh, the Arizona desert and Australia. Tuttle based his hotel designs on the work of the great Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa, who tried to mix indigenous traditions with a vision of modernity. Bawa built a new parliament for Sri Lanka that looks like a monumental version of an Aman resort, or the Prince Maurice for that matter. It was meant to express a sense of national identity, a blend of tradition with modernity. But the style has been hi- jacked, to become the acceptable face of contemporary luxury, a place for latterday Marie Antoinettes to play at being castaways.</p>",
  "<p>Picture this: a reception in Fresher's Week and a cluster of tanned first-year students are hovering in an oak-panelled room, clutching warm sherry and eyeing each other self-consciously. 'I just got back from Australia two days ago,' says one. 'I'm like totally jet-lagged, we were just drinking twenty-four seven.' 'Oh God, yah, I was just in Goa,' says another, anxious to compete, 'and we were just like off our faces the whole time.' 'When I was in Koh Pan Yang,' says a blond boy with public school vowels, 'mushrooms were so cheap, I don't think I was straight for like six months.' 'I was the same in Bolivia,' says another, nodding sagely. 'I think it's like a really valuable experience to go to the East - it's so important to get away from western consumerism,' says a girl festooned in designer labels. 'What about you?' </p> <p>'Oh, I spent the year teaching illiterate Gypsy children in the south of Spain,' I say, aiming for studied nonchalance. A puzzled silence descends. The tanned faces buckle into expressions of incomprehension - ' Why? ' they are not quite saying. 'But I was like completely loaded the whole time,' I add quickly, in case they think I'm a Christian or a member of Amnesty International. </p> <p>Voluntary work always used to be the justification for spending a year abroad before university - you could get sponsorship, you got all the benefits of travel and it allowed you to demonstrate to your prospective institution what a noble person you were. It was also useful for persuading a generation of middle-class parents doubtful as to the wisdom of a year off that you were doing something that could be quantified as 'worthwhile', so they'd let you out of their sight. But in recent years there seems to have been a subtle shift of emphasis. According to the latest report by the Gap Year Company, fewer than 5 per cent of students travelling abroad before university take part in voluntary work; travel has become a valid end in itself and universities and employers are no more likely to be impressed if you spent a year building a hospital in Angola than if you spent it face down in your own vomit in a Thai brothel.</p> <p> Even Prince William - who will probably do neither of the above - is being encouraged to broaden his horizons by spending a year sampling another culture. The mere business of getting yourself to the other side of the world, not losing your passport or return ticket, avoiding rapists, pickpockets and murderers, and managing to get yourself home again without unwittingly packing 10 kilos of heroin is evidence of initiative, curiosity and a survival instinct that will prepare you well for adult life. At least, this is what the students tell their parents. </p> <p>But even if all this unbridled hedonism has left the do-gooding teenager on the edge of extinction, I still firmly believe that a gap year should be compulsory for all right-thinking young people about to go off to university. There are pros and cons to every choice, of course, but the crucial advantage common to all gap year experiences is that it forces you to grow up. Some might argue that stumbling round the subcontinent in your underwear eating the local hallucinogens while trying to have sex with Australians is not necessarily proof of maturity, but at least it gives you the chance to live away from home for the first time and make all your mistakes before you get to college. A gap year is a chance to reinvent yourself. You're transient, as are the people you meet - they don't know your parents, they don't know whether you were a geek at school, they don't know that you used to do your hair like Robert Smith without irony. You can be an entirely different person, and since you'll never see any of these people again (even if you do, none of you will remember), you can practice inventing your new away-from-home personality so that you get it right before you make it to university and are stuck with it for the next three years. </p> <p>It's also very hard not to become more interesting after a year of travel. During those first terrifying days at university, no matter how often people tell you their totally cool and totally identical stories about trekking through Nepal on acid, they're still more fun to talk to than those - how young they seem! - who are still having the conversation about what A levels they got. That was, like, years ago ! (Or - God forbid - the ones who spent their year off working for an engineering firm in Swindon and who turn up at college with smug sponsorship cheques in their student account and rollerball pens in their breast pockets. This is not a valid use of your year off.) </p> <p>A gap year is for being bold, adventurous, wild - and, in some cases, altruistic. The great advantage of voluntary work, apart from the spiritual rewards and the warm glow inside that comes from helping others, is that people are more likely to give you money if they think you're teaching poor children how to read than if they think you're spending it on skunk and tequila. (Which is not to say that you can't do both.) It also gives you the chance to engage with the local people and become part of a community in a way that is impossible if you only pass through with a backpack. The key is to find an organisation that is not too rigid in its structures and rules, so that you can combine the hard work with the kind of self-exploration and experimentation that is the main point of a gap year. </p> <p>Unless you're exceptionally lucky - or rich - you'll leave university with at least \u00a35,000 of debt, get sucked into the relentless carousel of job interviews, acquire more debt, and carefree travelling will become an impossible luxury. My advice would be: go while you've got the chance - build schools, climb mountains, learn to dive, learn a language, smoke dope, drink too much and have a fantastic time. Find yourself. Just don't find yourself in an office... </p> <p><strong> Ten facts about gap years</strong><br> </p> <p> 150,000, or one in five, students take a gap year before entering university </p> <p><strong> 2</strong> 35,000 are state school leavers and 15,000 are from independent schools. 30% are women travelling alone. </p> <p><strong> 3</strong> Only 10,000 of the 200,000 people aged 26 and under who take gap years embark on a structured placement. </p> <p><strong> 4</strong> More than half of all school leavers taking gap years remain in Europe; one in 10 visits Central or South America. </p> <p><strong> 5</strong> Australia is the most popular destination among older travellers, with one-fifth spending most of their time there. </p> <p><strong> 6</strong> The least popular destination is Africa. </p> <p><strong> 7</strong> Asia is popular among all age groups. On average, 14% of British travellers visit the Far East. </p> <p><strong> 8</strong> Of those returning from trips, 70% say they would go again. Two-thirds claim that their gap-year experience has changed them. </p> <p><strong> 9</strong> One-third of people taking a gap year travel alone, and nearly half set off with just one companion; 20% of backpackers do not return with the person they left with. </p> <p><strong> 10</strong> \u00a32,000 is the average spent on a six-month trip. The biggest problem for those wishing to take a gap year is raising enough money; the second biggest problem is securing a visa. </p> <p> Research by Ben Cooper </p>",

  "<p><br><strong>Address: </strong>Birdcage, London</p> <p>There is something agreeably laid back about the Birdcage. \"If you want to book for lunch,\" says the message on the answerphone, \"leave your name and telephone number twice, or just turn up at the restaurant.\" Obviously, they're not overwhelmed with lunchtime trade, but it still has an efficient, cheerful, friendly tone to it, and that sets the style for the service, as well. It's as if all those associated with the Birdcage want to convey that the restaurant is rather different. </p> <p>In fact, it is about as different as it is possible to be -from entry to exit, from menu to wine list, from first mouthful to last, it is like being in the company of a kindly, eccentric, humorous relative who has a mad enthusiasm for the Orient. The dining room, which isn't exactly gigantic, is so stuffed with Orientaliana as to hardly allow any room for tables. Figurines, peacock feathers, swathes of decorative fabrics, mirrors, pictures, plants glitter in the crepuscular gloom. The tables themselves are so covered with decorative bits and bobs as to scarcely have room for plate, bread, wine and all the other paraphernalia of eating. Then the menu comes, stuck to the flyleaf of a book; and the wine list is in the form of an origami bird. </p> <p>In the face of this onslaught of individuality amounting to nuttiness, it is easy to be distracted from the originality and excellence of the food. Even here the sense of having entered another world persists. There aren't many places - actually, there aren't any places - where you will find goat consomm\u00e9 with Irish moss and wakame tartlet, ackee whitefish in paperbark with lavender-drenched potato, or Japanese golden plum echinacea ice cream with baby bee or giant hornet honey glaze, or that suggests a glass of pudding wine to wash down a chocolate-covered scorpion, worm or cricket. And, yes, that's real scorpions, worms and crickets. Three crickets (though they might have been locusts), cropped up on top of my bitter cactus rice knapsacks in pan-leaf canvas. </p> <p>This outr\u00e9 display of exotic ingredients might simply be distracting, ridiculous or downright disgusting in incompetent hands, but they aren't. They all play useful and active parts in the utterly consistent and highly structured world of Michael von Hruschka, itself a name that is cause for wonder. I believe he helped out at that early bird of east-meets-west fusion, the Hempel, but has since taken the precepts, and indeed the whole notion of fusion, to an illogical but divertingly delicious extreme. On the whole, I am no great lover of fusion food. Too often, it is an excuse for culinary promiscuity in which the sum is considerably less than the parts. But von Hruschka manages to avoid both clich\u00e9 and confusion. </p> <p>After much mulling, Blossom - who eats fish but not meat - and I chose: a triptych of squid, honeyed Hungarian chilli pig with tiger-nut pesto square, then pear-and-raisin cigarillos with jasmine and poppyseed anglaise to finish (me); salmon with Japanese spices, then mohinga with ackee fishballs (Blossom); and bitter cactus rice in pan-leaf canvas between us out of curiosity. </p> <p>Each dish arrived in exquisite arrangements of tiny parcels, blocks and bricks. You think you are getting one thing, but no, you get three variations, each tied in a Lilliputian strip of lime peel, decorated with a stem of cress or whatever. The effect is like being served a series of Faberg\u00e9 miniatures. This is labour-intensive stuff to cook, but not to eat. </p> <p>Take my triptych of squid. There was a diminutive heap of roasted rice with scrolls of limpidly tender squid, that cephalopodic sweetness peeking through a clean, chilli-driven dressing. There was a dainty bowl of Stygian black soup made of squid ink and heaven knows what else, which was slightly thickened, seductively, sourishly acidic and rich beyond measure. Between these came a brace of taut and spiced squid spring rolls. It was a brilliant sequence of differences, each fully characterised and compellingly edible. </p> <p>A true-blue Hungarian might have trouble recognising a national dish in von Hruschka's version of the pork dish, but the restrained sweetness of the honey, pointed warmth of the paprika and the aromatic dryness of the tiger-nut pesto square made for a rare and meticulously balanced mouthful. And as for the Japanese gold plum business, well... </p> <p>Given the range and variety within each dish, I would need a volume or two to describe the elements and effects of our lunch, and after a while such detail becomes as wearisome to read as it is to write. Who, after all, stops to note, codify and remember tastes in detail in the course of a meal when your companion is amusing, intelligent, diverting and perceptive. Sad sacks only. I did take notes, because I am a compulsive sad sack, but I have no intention of inflicting my affliction on you. </p> <p>Instead, I want you to go along and try out the Birdcage for yourselves. It will not be to everyone's taste. The mad clutter, quirky humour and the wild combinations, unabashed theatricality, fastidious decorative style and miniaturism of the dishes will irritate as many people as those who fall in love with them. </p> <p>Those who want to love need to be prepared to pay a price. I paid \u00a386.30, which included a restricted amount of wine - five glasses between us, including two glasses of champagne: \u00a330.50-worth, to be exact. Two courses at lunch cost \u00a319.50, three cost \u00a326.50, but considering the labour, love, originality and Epicurean pleasure involved in each mouthful, it isn't unreasonable. You will pay more and have less fun in most places in London. Or the Orient, come to that.</p>",
  "Two images stand out from the protests taking place outside the Democrats' convention in Los Angeles this week. The first was of battalions of riot police, equipped as if for an invasion, standing guard outside the downtown temples of corporate America as demonstrators marched past. The second was of the mainly Latino workers in the Broadway sweatshops leaning out of windows to cheer on the marchers protesting against \"corporate greed\" and globalisation. <p>The images symbolise both what is missing from conventional American politics, what divides the haves and have-nots of the world's richest country and what is fuelling the still unspecific but growing international movement that started in Seattle last year and will be seeking another platform in Prague next month. </p> <p>Only half of the American electorate vote for the president and the events of the past week in LA have partly served to explain why. The financial clout of the corporations now gives the appearance of having permeated every aspect of policy-making so that it is no longer clear to many people whether their elected representatives are acting in the voters' interests or their backers' interests. </p> <p>Do politicians shy away from real gun reform because of the gun manufacturers' lobby? Do they back a judicial system that jails more than 2m Americans because the prison-industrial complex now carries such weight? Are they helping the Colombian government in a civil war because they want to protect the interests of American oil and because it suits the military-industrial complex? For many politicians the answer may be no, but the suspicion will remain as long as the race is to the richest. The news this week that George W Bush had now raised $100m for his campaign and his running mate, Dick Cheney, had received a corporate pay-off of $20m further emphasised the great gulf between those inside the safe convention walls and those outside on the streets. And it is this gut feeling that the corporations and the international financial bodies are now controlling decisions on wages, the environment or immigration, that has helped to mobilise this still loosely-knit confederation of protest. </p> <p>What fuels it, too, in the United States, is the feeling that neither of the two main parties offer alternatives on what are to some people the most important issues of the day. One of the angriest demonstrations of the week focused on those on death row and in jail for drugs offences. Both Democrats and Republicans back the death penalty and both support the \"war on drugs\" that has led to the incarceration of so many. Indeed one of Al Gore's pledges during his acceptance speech was for a further 50,000 police officers. Not a further 50,000 teachers for a country with the illiteracy levels similar to those of many third world countries; not a further 50,000 medical workers for a country where 40m are not entitled to healthcare. No wonder some of the placards outside carried the slogan: \"Don't incarcerate, educate\". </p> <p>The ghost at the feast this week has been Ralph Nader, the Green party's candidate and now the repository of the hopes of the liberal left outside the Democratic party. His name was written in the heavens by a sky-writing plane on Wednesday and has been on the lips of many throughout the week. Is a vote for Nader a vote for Bush is the question that will be asked many times between now and November, but increasingly the evidence is that the uncommitted, the independents and the disillusioned Democrats will be heading his way. If these votes do indeed lose Gore the election, the next big question will be whether it leads to a larger, more focused movement and whether the Greens are the party best equipped to lead it. </p> <p>Al Gore and George W Bush may bask in the warm glow of their respective conventions, but outside the air-conditioned halls it is clear that the old order is no longer trusted by the very people - the young, the poor, the Latinos, the blacks - they are claiming to want to help. Somehow, it seems unlikely that many hands would be waving from sweatshop windows if either of the two presidential parties had ventured down Broadway in their limos this week. </p> <p> duncan.campbell@theguardian.com</p>",
  "<p>Last year the king of Jordan was supposed to have disguised himself as a taxi-driver to find out what his people really felt and thought. Driving a cab or riding the Tube would be a good idea, not only for kings and prime ministers, but also for newspaper editors, who play a crucial role in shaping a national identity and culture. A nation's fears and prejudices can certainly be triggered by sensational tabloid campaigns, such as the News of the World's name-and-shame anti-paedophile campaign. But they also develop, less visibly and dramatically, on a day-to-day basis, in response to more muted signals and omissions in the broadsheets. </p> <p>This week I witnessed a scene on a London bus that strikingly reflected both the real changes in the city's multicultural demography and the lingering racism, xenophobia, and aggression below the surface. A large middle eastern family, including women and babies, and laden with pushchairs and shopping, were having trouble keeping their packages out of the aisle. An elderly lady nearly tripped over their trolley. When they got off at the next stop, a man near the exit loudly expressed his disgust: \"Wouldn't have been allowed on the bus in my day. Should go back where they came from! No buses in the desert!\" </p> <p>How did this incident connect to the influence of the serious press? Neither the xenophobe nor the women were probable readers of the Guardian or the Telegraph. I remember that when I first came to London in the 60s, elderly ladies would also make racist remarks on the buses, usually about the Jamaican conductors. Certainly Britain has become a more legally egalitarian country, and the press has contributed, through editorials, to the notable decline of intolerance, incivility, and small-minded provincialism. </p> <p>But the press could also take more notice of the subtle changes that occur when a society is transformed by immigration and manners, and help its readers become more aware and understanding. As an American, I'm aware of small but intriguing differences between British and American media, especially around the representation of birth, marriage, and death. Such events and their accompanying rituals are part of our lives, but they get widely varying treatment in the press. </p> <p>Some British newspapers, including the Guardian, ignore birth and downplay marriage. Others treat birth and marriage as society news or paid announcements. Virtually all give most attention and space to death, in obituaries and wills. </p> <p>An obituary signals that someone has had a life of distinction, whereas a newborn has few accomplishments beyond its parentage. But the British broadsheets, despite their enlightened editorial policies, still seem to reflect the beginnings and endings of an elite population. American newspapers give most attention to marriage, in a culture where intermarriages, upwardly mobile marriages, and contemporary courtship are subjects of intense social scrutiny. </p> <p>The British press is more interested in birth than its American counterpart, but in a different way. The Times and Telegraph publish birth announcements as social events: \"Born to James and Antonia, Cassandra Hermione, a sister for Tarquin.\" All the papers treat the arrival of a well-born infant, from baby Leo to baby Rocco, as a significant news item (and Hello! and OK couldn't survive a week without \"presenting\" the infants of B-list celebs). </p> <p>The papers list birthdays, not only of the famous living but also of the dead; and they are impressed by the birthdays of the very old, especially aged royals. Undoubtedly, most of this coverage is simply tradition, but it also reinforces an anachronistic image of the class system, with its hereditary titles, and of the traditional family with two parents. </p> <p>By contrast, when American newspapers report birth, they tend to do so as a sociological rather than a social occasion. The Washington Post lists \"district newborns\" by hospital in a weekly column, an illuminating glimpse of American diversity and social change. Many of the births are to single mothers, or unmarried couples, and the babies' names reveal ethnicity and inventiveness. These are examples from the weeks in which my grandchildren were born: Va'Shay, Bridget, Valencia, Precious Tityana, Lovely Candy, Nirvana Joy, Lawrencia Noelene, Ebony Imani (girls); Efuw Bandiwa, Kavon Shamal, John Geoffrey, Sincere Lamont, Da'Quan Ali, Marques Javonne (boys). </p> <p>I suspect that most of the babies on that bus were born here, and I'm sure that a journalistic record of births in London would reveal as much ethnic diversity as in Washington or New York. All of the papers devoted considerable space this week to Madonna's complaints that English hospitals were inefficient and Victorian; they pointed out that infant mortality rates in Britain are lower than in the US. There are social as well as medical changes taking place in those Victorian hospitals, with long-term significance for the culture as a whole, and not just for jetset celebrities.</p>",
  "<p>Back in 1992, long before Ireland began its dizzying economic upward curve, a group of theatregoers huddled into Dublin's cramped Project theatre to witness The Emergency Session, an evening of hardcore Celtic gangsta-rap, presented by the country's most celebrated young company, Rough Magic. As the lights came down over thumping breakbeats, our MC, a hip-hop reincarnation of Ireland's first president and guiding spiritual father, Eamon de Valera, pimp-rolled onstage to the rhythm, spitting out the verses in that priestly county Limerick twang so familiar to the home audience. </p> <p>Numbers included Cead Mile Failte [100,000 welcomes], Bitch, an indictment of the Republic's treatment of women, and Neutral, More or Less, about Ireland's famed nudge-and-wink neutrality. However, the most memorable moment came with a tongue-in-cheek vision called Eire 2016AD, which conjured up a rosy picture of the state a century on from the uprising against British rule that led to its foundation: \"This country's really moving, the economy's improving,\" rapped MC Dev to incredulous guffaws, before following up with the queasy prediction: </p> <p> \"We all know how it's going to be, don't we? <br>One big theme park, a quaint holiday, <br>Unless you're female or homeless or gay. <br>But we won't let reality get in the way, <br>Here in theme park Ireland, Slainte, have a nice day...\" </p> <p>Returning to live in Ireland after almost 10 years away, I have often been struck by the eerie prescience of that show, a cassette of which I carried with me on my odyssey first to London and then to St Petersburg. What was then so preposterous that it barely made sense in the realm of satire has now miraculously become a reality. From a basket-case economy that ran up such debilitating international debt in the late 70s and 80s that the IMF seriously considered foreclosure in 1986, Ireland has been transformed into the mythical Celtic Tiger, a technological overachiever with double digit growth rates approaching three times the European average. </p> <p>Unemployment, which approached 20% in the 80s, is now down to 4%, and the debilitating, centuries-old emigration trend has been shunted into reverse. In the most startling development, Ireland is now the world's biggest exporter of computer software, nudging ahead of America for the first time last year. </p> <p>Entirely new stereotypes have displaced the downtrodden models of the past: \"Striding through the streets of Dublin these days,\" gushed Fortune magazine late last year, \"is an entirely new species of Irishman and Irishwoman: educated, optimistic and affluent - unaffected by the twin demons of poverty and despair that hounded their ancestors for the last several hundred years.\" </p> <p>And the Irish Times recently claimed: \"There is now a real surge of power in the Celtic psyche, where the Irish in the world are seen as models for business acumen, drive, ambition, political and social progress and achievements in the arenas of music, sport and literature.\" </p> <p>Yet despite the frothy rhetoric - which appears to have intoxicated most politicians - it is difficult to escape the sense that the Irish were still refusing to let \"reality get in the way\". Certainly the Dublin that greeted me was not the vibrant model capital of these congratulatory profiles, but largely the same scattered, grubby and vaguely planned provincial city I'd left 10 years ago, though now far more polluted and congested. House prices had gone up 300-500% and, as was obvious from the blankets and bundles in shop doorways across the city, homelessness had reached conspicuous, Thatcherite proportions, rising by 150% in the past year. Though there were considerably more jobs around, few people in my immediate circle were materially better off, and many felt the opposite. </p> <p>And the general mood among many commentators was far from celebratory: \"The economic boom has not really reflected itself on the basics of what people expect of living in a decent society,\" says author and columnist Fintan O'Toole, \"A lot of the impact has been negative, in that it is much more difficult to buy a house, to travel around the capital, and to access a lot of basic services.\" Far from being a nation finally at peace with itself and comfortable with its new-found affluence, Celtic Tiger Ireland seems increasingly fraught with contradictions. </p> <p>Few economists or politicians predicted this and, consequently, even fewer have any idea of what course it will take in the future. It is also an economic recovery that happened almost entirely independently of the Irish business elite, who had conspicuously failed for decades to lift the country out of terminal depression. </p> <p>The Celtic Tiger was essentially created not by the Irish but by American hi-tech multinationals, eager to find a convenient launch-pad into Europe and attracted to Ireland by its educated and moderately rewarded workforce, Euro-friendly orientation, and crucially, by its rock-bottom 10% rate of corporate tax (compared to 40% in Germany and over 30% in Britain). Put bluntly: \"It was based on criminally low taxation rates to attract foreign industry,\" says writer and journalist John Waters. \" In effect, Ireland became a laundering operation for multinational industry in order to avoid tax.\" </p> <p>By the mid-90s, this was beginning to bear fruit: $7bn direct investment in 1997 alone. The impact has been most beneficially felt in the employment market. Jobs have become so freely available that Ireland, once Europe's greatest exporter of humanity, has now begun to run out of people - every shop or restaurant window in Dublin now displays \"help wanted\" notices, computer programmers are recruited en masse from Russia and navvies shipped in from London. Meanwhile, wages for the majority of the Irish inhabitants have been kept artificially low by a \"social partnership\" agreement and still weigh in at just 80% of the European average. </p> <p>Corruption is now ancient history <br>There were no convictions (obviously) <br>Well, different standards applied at the time, <br>We didn't know taking a bribe was a crime, <br>It used to be called a consultancy fee <br>Way back in 2015AD. </p> <p>No other single factor has done quite so much to undermine the inflated rhetoric of the boom than the constant revelations flowing from tribunals set up to investigate massive wrongdoing by the political and business elite in the 70s, 80s and early 90s. Irish politics is now not merely tainted by corruption, but characterised by it. The definitive Irish sleaze bible is an engrossing little tome entitled This Great Little Nation: the A-Z of Irish Scandals and Controversies. It was written by Gene Kerrigan and Pat Brennan, and runs to over 300 pages of epic wrongdoing in the beef industry, a little priestly paedophilia, land re-zoning scams, bribe-taking, party political cronyism and a massive banking tax evasion scheme. </p> <p>At the centre of the vast web of political scandal is Charles Haughey, the country's taoiseach - prime minister - throughout much of the 80s and early 90s. It transpires that Haughey supported a lavish lifestyle by soliciting \"donations\" from businessmen totalling some IR\u00a38m, and misdirected party funds, including some for his own use. Facilitated by his financial adviser, he also operated a secret offshore financial haven, and in the latest, grubby instalment, played out some weeks ago before the Moriarty tribunal, ran up a IR\u00a31.1m unauthorised bank overdraft in the 70s, some of which was never paid off. Beneath Haughey, there appears to have been a legion of dishonest politicians and business leaders, many operating the same Cayman Island scheme to evade tax. </p> <p>Exactly how and why Ireland became the land of crooks and shirkers may puzzle us for decades. Much of it happened simply because, amid weak democratic structures and lazy press reporting, it could. But some of it must be put down to a peculiarly Irish distrust of structures of power, rules and regulations, always considered alien and Anglo-Saxon. </p> <p>The essential \"truth\" of Irish social interaction - ad hoc, unstructured, public house relations - was always liable to degrade into cronyism and graft: \"It was part of that kind of macho world where one could also tell your friends how you had drunk seven pints, driven home and evaded Garda checkpoints,\" says novelist Dermot Bolger. \"In the same way that drunken driving was publicly acceptable, tax evasion wasn't regarded as criminal.\" </p> <p>By far the most disturbing aspect of this corruption is the country's reluctance to punish any of the culprits. To date, none of the major protagonists has been imprisoned or even fined. After an abortive attempt to bring Haughey to trial, he still enjoys a luxurious lifestyle in his north Dublin mansion and on his own private island. Instead of being penalised, these disgraced figures of the past have simply crept back into the system and many have been the greatest beneficiaries of the boom. It is likely that we are now generating plenty of fresh material for the tribunals of the future. </p> <p>Now we're no longer down on our knees, <br>Our children don't have to seek work overseas <br>And so we can counsel these new refugees <br>Flooding into the country in twos and threes <br>Get back in line, can't you read the sign <br>No dogs or Bosnians please. </p> <p>On a social level, the boastfulness and bluster of the new Celtic Tiger ethos has not translated into an inclusive and open-minded national outlook, a real confidence that would reflect a people sure of their own abilities and able to respect the contributions of others. In fact, it appears to have triggered long-dormant prejudices, actively encouraging a nasty strain of unselfconscious xenophobia. </p> <p>The persistent railing against \"blacks\" that many of us have heard from friends and relatives, and the often naked aggression against foreigners on the streets of the capital, couldn't be more profoundly disappointing. Most of the hostility is directed against asylum-seekers, who have begun to arrive in significant but relatively small numbers - rising from 362 to 8,000 over the past six years: nine in 10 have experienced verbal abuse on the streets, according to one survey, and seven out of 10 had been refused services. </p> <p>The government this year launched a policy of dispersal, which basically dumps refugees in rural areas where they are isolated from support and aid groups, barred from working, given meals in B&amp;B or hostel conditions that they often cannot tolerate on religious grounds, and given just IR\u00a315 a week to live on. John McDermott of the Refugee Information Service, says: \"Opposition politicians are fond of saying that it is a shambles. But it's not a shambles if you are a racist. If you are a racist it all makes perfect sense.\" </p> <p>We've got democracy the Irish way, <br>With a referendum every day, <br>News update on the latest amendment, <br>You can have an abortion, as long as you're not pregnant. </p> <p>There can be little doubt that Ireland has made a giant leap towards becoming a secular state over the past decade: contraception is now freely available, limited divorce is finally on the statutes and the influence of the church largely destroyed by sex scandals in the early 90s. The country is now predominantly urban, with two-thirds of the population living in towns and cities, a negative image of the 30s and 40s, when De Valera forged his vision of a rural priest-ridden Catholic wonderland, populated by athletic farm-boys and comely maidens dancing at the crossroads. </p> <p>Yet, almost by sheer force of habit, much of the old order remains. This is still the only country in Europe to outlaw abortion, the only country in the world with this ban written into its constitution. In an act of collective moral doublethink, we continue to tolerate the fact that over 6,000 Irish women must travel every year to Britain for the operation, an alarmingly high percentage in late-term because of the lack of support and advice at home. </p> <p>And though, in the wake of the infamous X case in 1992, when the state attempted to prevent a 14-year-old rape victim from travelling to London for a termination, abortions have been allowed on a technicality when the life of the mother was in danger, a new referendum is currently being mooted to plug this loophole. </p> <p>A frantic Riverdancing nation, <br>Faint with self congratulation, <br>Where the only debate we'll ever condone, is <br>Will there be life after Boyzone? </p> <p>One of the more striking ironies of the Irish resurgence is that, as the new mythology rises up to displace the defunct rural, mud-hut primitive imagery of the past, Ireland has become far more efficient, in the cultural arena, at manufacturing and marketing the old stereotypes. The success of this strategy is reflected most spectacularly in the onward march of the Riverdance extravaganza, which has now moved ahead of U2 as Ireland's most lucrative cultural export. But the same dynamic is also evident in some more upmarket recent international successes, such as Martin McDonagh's Tony award-winning play The Beauty Queen of Leenane, and, to a lesser extent, Conor McPherson's The Weir, both of which peddle nostalgic and distorted aspects of Ireland and now appear even more hollow and untruthful. </p> <p>McDonagh's melodramatic oeuvre seems particularly symptomatic of a culture being driven by an outmoded and objectified self-image, its plots crammed with stage-Oirish creatures of mind-boggling artifice, and dialogue laced with sub-Synge idioms that could creditably pass for parody. </p> <p>For the audiences in London or New York who made successes of these plays, the west of Ireland shack settings and their logorrhaic muck-savage inhabitants appear impossibly exotic and elemental. When the works eventually return to Ireland, they are protected from any kind of vigorous criticism by a phalanx of awards and accolades. Overall, the dynamic is not unlike the one that has colonised downtown Dublin with fake Oirish pubs, whose emeraldy, signposty, plastic ambience proved such a huge hit in Helsinki and Manhattan that it was then re-imported back into Ireland, widely supplanting the authentic item that inspired them. </p> <p>Irish culture has been transformed into little more than a brand name, specifically and somewhat cynically engineered to appeal to foreign or expatriate perceptions, and then mistaken for the real thing when it arrives home. Product that doesn't match the ingredients listed on the label, such as Marina Carr's play, On Raftery's Hill, which brilliantly captured the spirit of a xenophobic, inward-looking nation, is simply discarded, playing to half-full houses at home and receiving cool reviews abroad. </p> <p>Ireland cannot really be like this. <br>One big theme Pub, the Pogue Mahone, <br>Where the rackrent landlords are all home grown, <br>There's a new pornography: property prices, <br>And the sexiest words are 'housing crisis.' <br>It's our own asylum, and so it will be, <br>In Eire 2016AD </p> <p>Despite the economic and material advances made over the past decade, and the revolution in employment opportunities, Ireland is failing to live up to the expectations generated by its own propaganda and its new status as one of Europe's more affluent nations. If the new wealth is viewed as a test of national character, it is one that we have failed quite abjectly, in our treatment of refugees and other races, in our ability to build and maintain adequate public and social services, in our ability to share the dividends with the poorer sectors of society. </p> <p>This adoptive self-image of a brash modern nation also fails to take account of the deeply conflicted nature of Irish society and alienates the majority who appear to be reaping meagre benefits. Truth for truth, and folly for folly, the idea of a technologically advanced, highly affluent Tiger nation striding boldly into the 21st century seems to be no more nor less accurate than any of the previous fictions that exerted such a grip on Irish identity, from the misty Celtic Twilight of Yeats to Dev's rosy rustic picture, each of which eventually led into a cultural and spiritual dead end. </p> <p>Ireland is given to illusory, indulgent images of itself. With the latest Celtic Tiger variant, all it has managed to do is modernise its self-delusion. What Eire really looks like in 2016AD depends on decisions taken right now. With extra cash surging through the system, there is for the first time a chance to cut through these prevailing fictions and build a society on well-funded social principles. </p> <p>However, we seem more intent on using further tax cuts to prolong the party, letting us bask a little longer in the glow of the superheated economy. All the indications suggest that we will be gazing back from MC Dev's watershed centennial year, fondly recalling the frenzy of the Celtic Tiger boom years and perhaps lamenting the missed opportunity to transform Ireland into a modern, egalitarian, inclusive as well as affluent country. </p> <p>\u0095 Verses by Arthur Riordan</p>",
  "<p>Tina Modotti was always rather dismissive of her beauty - as only the very beautiful tend to be. The photographer Edward Weston was famously smitten by her: his nude portraits of Modotti are among the most arresting images of the 20th century. Diego Rivera immortalised her in his public murals. Pablo Neruda penned her epitaph: \"Perfect your gentle name, perfect your fragile life,\" he wrote. She inspired deep infatuation, great art, poignant poetry. </p> <p>Modotti's looks served her well throughout her short life, and were instrumental in kick-starting her spell as a 20s Hollywood silent-screen star, the first of several varied careers. Soon after giving up film work, she became the model, lover and apprentice of Weston. </p> <p>A kind of It girl of the avant-garde, Modotti was both celebrated and vilified in her lifetime. She was well known for her grand romances with illustrious men, and for her apparently effortless knack of inspiring others. \"Drama goes with her, has been born with her and will die with her,\" read one particularly febrile newspaper editorial following the assassination of her communist Cuban lover, Julio Antonio Mella - and a charge against her of conspiracy in his murder. </p> <p>Add to such high-octane intrigue her political activism in Mexico, Moscow and Europe - not to mention her early and sudden death in 1942, at the age of 46 - and it is easy to see why the Modotti myth has been revisited in recent years. Unsurprisingly, there has been talk of a feature film about her life - she is an immensely versatile icon, representing many things to many people: the dangerous femme fatale; the gentle, tragic spirit; the proto-feminist; the committed revolutionary. </p> <p>Then, of course, there is the matter of her photography - ultimately, the only real certainty about her. Whatever the feverish speculation that surrounded the cult of her persona - and surrounds it still - Modotti was a great and visionary photographer. Her gifts and passion were unique, and her skill truly groundbreaking. In a photographic career of less than a decade, she produced work that was so startlingly innovative that she is now widely considered to be an important pioneer of modern photography. So much so, in fact, that a few years ago one of her flower studies (Roses, from 1924) commanded nearly $200,000 at auction in New York, an unprecedented amount for the sale of a photograph. </p> <p>Still, such is the melodrama that surrounds her story - a mythology fuelled by the portraits of her as much as by her own images - that it has tended to colour the perception of her work. Recently shown in Arles, and moving next month to Helsinki, is a new exhibition, Tina Modotti And The Mexican Renaissance, which attempts to strip Modotti of the romanticism that surrounds her, and to present her work in a pure form within a strictly historical context. </p> <p>\"The story of her life has been presented as very Hollywood. Her reputation as a photographer must stand or fall by the intrinsic quality of her work,\" says the curator of the show, Sam Stourdz\u00e9, who describes the exhibition as \"austere\" in its conception. Excluding both Weston's portraits and Modotti's own famous flower studies, the show concentrates, instead, on her social documentary work in Mexico between 1923 and 1930. </p> <p>The exhibition was made possible by a surprise discovery. In 1994, the American biographer Patricia Albers, while researching for a book on Modotti, went to Oregon to meet the family of her subject's first husband, Roubaix de L'Abrie Rich\u00e9y, an American poet of French-Canadian origin known as Robo. The family directed Albers to their attic, where she found two crates packed with papers, letters, telegrams - and some original photographs and contact sheets that had never before been seen in public. They had been sent to Robo's mother, with whom Modotti had stayed in touch following her husband's death in 1923. The provenance was without doubt; many of the pictures even bore the photographer's distinctive handwriting on their reverse sides, \"like postcards\", says Stourdz\u00e9. The exhibition is the first showcase in Europe for these photographs, and they will be displayed alongside photographs from the private collection of New York dealer Truck Morton. </p> <p>It is, perhaps, no surprise that Modotti was so drawn to Mexico. She said that it reminded her of her homeland. Born into a working-class family in Udine, northern Italy, in 1896, Modotti had followed her father and sister to California in 1913. She found work as a seamstress, but soon emerged from obscurity when she took to the stage in the theatres of the San Francisco Italian community and, following her marriage to Robo, the Hollywood studio world. She enjoyed some success on the silent-movie screen, although she was always typecast as a gypsy or harem girl. \"The exotic allure of Tina Modotti,\" proclaimed a poster for The Tiger's Eye of 1920. \"They could not picture an Italian girl except with a knife in her teeth and blood in her eye,\" Weston later wrote. </p> <p>Modotti soon tired of the movie world, however, and - spurred on by her adulterous liaison with Weston - she became increasingly drawn to photography. There is no doubt that she benefited from the tutelage of the brilliant Weston: much can be seen of his influence in her work - she quickly assimilated his formal, rigorous skill in composition and meticulous approach to developing and printing. Photography became her passion, and even when the relationship with Weston foundered, she ensured that the apprenticeship thrived. </p> <p>Despite her affair, it seems that Modotti's marriage to Robo was still functioning. It was Robo who first left for Mexico, in 1921, and his wife planned to join him later. A couple of months into his stay, however, he became ill with smallpox and, after a violent few days, died. Despite Robo's death, Modotti went to Mexico as planned, where she set up her own studio in Mexico City and began to earn her living through portrait photography while continuing to work on her increasingly politically-conscious photographs. </p> <p>In 1910, the 34-year dictatorship of General Porfirio Diaz had collapsed into a brutal conflict that tore Mexico apart. It wasn't until a decade later that hostilities subsided, and when the left-wing leader General Alvaro Obregon came to power in 1920, the nation experienced a burst of creative energy and optimism. Modernisation was getting underway, and the arts were, for the first time in living memory, being treated with a new seriousness. An ambitious cultural policy was coming into play, combining social and educational initiatives. Little wonder that intellectuals, writers, poets and artists were drawn to Mexico City, which quickly established itself as the central axis of this cultural renewal and became home to an artistic revolution. It was not only painters such as Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo and David Alfaro Siqueiros who were exponents of the new vision; photographers, too, played a major role. </p> <p>Modotti quite easily found a place for herself in Mexico's artistic renaissance. She was especially struck by the work of the muralists, who encapsulated the mood of a country emerging from dictatorship and unrest: the desire to rediscover the country's pre-Hispanic traditions and renew its Indian roots was at the heart of the new movement, whatever the pictorial innovations it pioneered.<strong> </strong> \"The Indian people of Mexico became like her family,\" says Stourdz\u00e9. So much so, in fact, that Modotti, shocked by what she had heard about her native Italy under fascist rule, joined the Mexican Communist party in 1927. </p> <p>Weston taught her much, but the humanity and social engagement in Modotti's work are all her own. She photographed the life around her with such a revolutionary fervour that many of her pictures were published in the Mexican communist party's El Machete newspaper. She allied herself to the Estridentista, or Stridentist movement, a circle of writers and artists with internationalist aspirations for their country. It was a time when many photographers were clinging to a romantic ideal of Mexico, yet Modotti concentrated on the urban reality: she focused on Mexico as a nation in transition, and photographs such as those of telephone wires and telegraph poles became symbolic of the industrial modernisation that held such promise. Such images were rigorously constructed and, with their bold patterns and vertiginous angles, a million miles from the bucolic sensibility that was the norm at the time. </p> <p>This is not to say that Modotti was immune to \"exoticism\"; on the contrary, she was equally drawn to the picturesque drama of Mexican life, and her subjects are ennobled in her images. Many of the pictures discovered by Patricia Albers present images of workers as valiant heroes: Indians Carrying Blocks Of Stone ... (1927), for example, and Indians Carrying Corn Husks ... (1927) depict Mexico's indigenous population as the backbone of the country. Her work also emphasised the shortcomings of government institutions, capturing the stark contrasts between the lives of the rich and the poor by juxtaposing urban squalor with bourgeois scenes. </p> <p>Also among the new finds is an arresting image of a young girl writing. It's an image full of hopefulness: at that time, around 80% of the population were illiterate, and the government were introducing a literacy programme. Alongside this picture were found numerous street scenes of women and children going about their daily business in harsh conditions, some of them shot in soft focus. The photographs Making Tortillas and Women With Children Doing Laundry, along with the images of women carrying heavy loads on their heads, portray stoicism in adversity and a tenderness towards the subjects that stops just short of sentimentality. Modotti's emotional engagement, made almost abstract by the European modernism she had inherited from Weston, makes for some striking invention. In the shot of a political rally in 1928, before the murder of Obregon, the bold patterns made by the straw sombreros and draped white cotton clothing seem like symbols of quiet order amid tumult. </p> <p>Hands Resting On A Tool, meanwhile, a now almost-iconic image, is shown in the exhibition alongside one of Albers's discoveries, a shot of the gnarled feet and battered toenails of a Mexican-Indian worker in hyper-real glory. They make an arresting sight, as does the 1929 portrait of Modotti wearing Tehuantepec Indian costume - a self- portrait, and not a particularly accomplished photo, but a telling moment in the life of a woman for whom Mexico had become a kind of spiritual home. </p> <p>The photograph of the mother nursing her baby, in which the feeding infant's eyes are open, is also one of the newly discovered pictures. It is a particularly poignant shot, bearing in mind Modotti's own experiences. She was unable to have children - a string of grand passions transformed her life, but she died alone, with no family. All the more ironic, then, that Rivera miscasts Modotti as an earth mother in one of his murals high above the altar in a Mexican cathedral. Stourdz\u00e9 is philosophical on the subject. \"I think that it was because she had no family life that she was a great artist. She put everything into her photographs.\" </p> <p>Modotti's relationship with Julio Antonio Mella, the leader of the Cuban communist party who was living in exile in Mexico, drew her more deeply into political life. But after just four months together, Mella was assassinated as the couple were walking along a street in Mexico City. In the aftermath of his death, Modotti was arrested and tried for conspiracy in the murder, and the Mexican newspapers made headlines out of the false allegations. At the same time, Modotti was viewed as the official \"widow\" of the martyred hero, and became a kind of mascot for the international revolutionary movement. </p> <p>Modotti was eventually acquitted, but by 1930 all foreign communists were being expelled from Mexico. The authorities were watching Modotti closely, and became convinced - not without cause - that her house had become a base for insurgents. She was implicated, falsely, in a conspiracy to kill the Mexican president, and was deported. She spent the rest of the decade based in Moscow as a Soviet agent and apparatchik, and during the Spanish Civil War acted as an organiser with Red Aid. When the republican cause was dashed, she returned to Mexico, an exile with a false passport, and - together with her new lover, the Spanish Civil War hero Vittorio Vidali - became involved again in political work. She died there from a heart attack, although rumours suggested foul play or even suicide. </p> <p>Modotti remained in the public eye - in Weston's nudes and Rivera's murals - even after her fashionableness as a photographer had faded,<strong> </strong> and the press remained intrigued by her starry presence. When she arrived in the US following her deportation from Mexico in 1930, press photographers scrabbled to take her picture. Trying to convince her to pose for them, they promised to make her look pretty. She later described the scene in a letter to Weston, adding, \"I could not understand what prettiness had to do with the revolutionary movement.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Tina Modotti And The Mexican Renaissance will show at Helsinki City Art Museum from September 12-November 15. A book of the exhibition, with 80 reproductions, is published by Jean Michel Place and is available from <a href=\"http://www.jmplace.com\">www.jmplace.com</a>.</p>"
