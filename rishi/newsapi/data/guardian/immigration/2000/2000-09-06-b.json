  "<p>When Blair got in, the doors opened. Charities and pressure groups which had been battling for years outside the stony walls of Whitehall suddenly found themselves invited into the warmth of government. Dialogues, compacts, placements; liaison panels, working groups, consultative committees. The names may have differed, but the message was the same: we care about your issues and we want to hear what you have to say. </p> <p>Three years on, many charity and public sector leaders are finding that the doors may be open, but the minds remain closed. For campaigners working on welfare and the environment, it has often been a slow process of disillusionment, as they realise that ministers are good at lending a sympathetic ear - but unwilling or unable to deliver. </p> <p>A few have got a little of what they want. Civil liberties groups were delighted when the government moved to introduce the Human Rights Act, although they found that Labour's initial reforming zeal was soon replaced by the old Whitehall fondness for secrecy and control in the shape of a watered down freedom of information bill and legislation enabling the state to snoop on private email. </p> <p>Others have simply felt betrayed. Refugee groups had been reassured by Labour's principled rhetoric in opposition, and devoted countless hours to a two-year long consultation process on reform of the asylum system, only to find themselves confronted with new immigration legislation that sought to exclude, impoverish and criminalise asylum-seekers. </p> <p>Campaigners who have got little from Labour need to get tough. Surveying the success factors for hundreds of recent campaigns for the new Campaigning Handbook, I noted the number of times organisations had used a new generation of techniques, such as legal actions, news management and internet campaigning, to force government to the negotiating table. </p> <p>The opportunities for such influence naturally peak in a pre-election year. Before the 1997 election, the Labour Party imposed a moratorium on any new spending commitments, following the decision to stick within Tory expenditure limits. Campaigners for better welfare provision were given a lecture about the real world, and in effect asked to take it on trust. This time, that argument won't wash. Any party which wants to win next time knows it needs to deliver on health, education and welfare. But the time for getting clear commitments from the politicians will soon run out. Campaigners need to negotiate hard now if they are going to get anything more after the next election than an open door and a friendly smile. </p> <p>\u0095 Mark Lattimer is author of the Campaigning Handbook, published next week at \u00a315.95 by the Directory of Social Change (020-7209 5151)</p>",

  "<p>Homebush Bay, a messy scrap of land nine miles west of central Sydney, has a chequered past - home to a saltworks, a brick factory, an arms depot, an abattoir and three decades of the city's dirtiest waste. Yet this unpromising patch of turf has sprouted towering stadiums, and will host the 27th Olympiad, billed as the first \"green Games\". </p> <p>In 1993, Sydney was the first city to bid for the Games on a platform of green promises. That year, the International Olympic Committee adopted the environment as its third \"tier\", after sport and culture, and IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch announced that Sydney won the 2000 Games \"partly because of the consideration given to environmental matters\". </p> <p>But the detritus from Homebush Bay's industrial past - 9m cubic metres of asbestos, heavy metals, DDT and dioxins - was soon exposed. </p> <p>\"It's been a bloody nightmare in some ways,\" says Sydney 2000's environment communications manager Michael Bland. The Olympic Co-ordination Authority (OCA), funded by the New South Wales government, took Greenpeace's advice to treat the waste on site rather than dumping it elsewhere, and a A$150m (\u00a360m) clean-up operation began. The dioxins - a by-product of the chemical weapon, Agent Orange, manufactured in Sydney for the US to spray on Vietnam - were chemically broken down. Other waste was treated with innovative \"bio-remediation\" techniques, using plants to filter and feed on waste. Greenpeace accepts that the Olympic site is now safe. </p> <p>Alongside the clean-up of Homebush came a construction programme boasting many environmental initiatives, including a headline-grabbing preservation programme for the endangered green and golden bell frog discovered hopping around the old brickworks. A six-fold increase in numbers followed, although Green Games Watch 2000 (GGW) cautions that it is too early to proclaim its long-term success. Energy and water-saving technologies are ubiquitous at the site. The athletes' village is the world's largest (predominantly) solar-powered suburb and will become ordinary - if expensive - homes after the event. Stadium Australia, the main arena, uses 30% less energy than conventional designs. Toilet water is recycled, cutting drinking water consumption by 50%. </p> <p>Across the city, triathletes have been terrified by sightings of sharks close to their Sydney harbour swimming course. Apart from a nasty oil spill a year ago, it has been seen as testimony to the improving quality of the harbourside water, although Bland believes that \"the best bio-indicator is that we've had lots of whales this year\". </p> <p>Inside Homebush, the use of plastics has also been minimised and a major recycling and composting system established. Food is served on crushed apple pulp plates, with baked cornflour cutlery. Sydney 2000 hopes to reduce landfill waste by 80%: \"an ambitious target,\" judges Greenpeace's international Olympics co-ordinator Blair Palese, \"but more power to them\". </p> <p>Even some of the 11 global Olympic \"partners\" have got in on the act, with Greenpeace pressuring Coca-Cola into pledging to trial environmentally friendly HFC-free refrigeration technology during the Games. </p> <p>Sydney 2000's effort to conserve energy, water and biodiversity while minimising waste and pollution has been done \"in spades\" claims Bland. \"We can be very justifiably proud.\" </p> <p>\"This is a turning point for the Olympic Games,\" agrees Palese. To have the Games \"virtually running on renewable energy\" is \"pretty impressive, no matter how you slice it\". </p> <p>But environmental groups offer some important qualifications. Greenpeace recently gave the Olympics a six out of 10 green rating. GGW echoed this, calling Sydney the \"semi-green\" Games. </p> <p>\"The biggest single failing has been the failure to change the Olympic sponsoring companies,\" says GGW's Bob Symington. Despite seven years in which to implement Sydney's environmental guidelines, none of the worldwide sponsors (Coca-Cola, McDonalds, IBM, Visa, Fuji-Xerox, Kodak, Panasonic, Samsung, Sports Illustrated, John Hancock and the United Parcel Service) has incorporated sustainability as a core business function, he argues. </p> <p> The secretive nature of the development, is also criticised by GGW, who argue that by keeping all losing tenders secret \"we have no idea what could have been built at Homebush Bay and how green it could have been\". </p> <p>Bland is dismissive: \"If that's the most serious problem they've got then they are really scratching around.\" </p> <p>But he accepts that apart from Coca-Cola's HFC-free tests and Samsung's supply of some green fridges, Sydney 2000 has failed to ban refrigeration and air conditioning that creates greenhouse gases. According to Greenpeace, there is not one environmentally friendly air-conditioning unit on site. </p> <p>\"We at the Olympics have been victims of the fact that the refrigeration and air-conditioning industry in Australia have been troglodytes,\" Bland explains. With the largest ozone hole in the world looming over the southern hemisphere, Sydney's failure to galvanise local industry to adopt non-HFC standards widespread elsewhere is far from exemplary, say critics. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Bland hopes that \"a new wave of environmental understanding\" could be the global legacy of the Games. \"We believe that these Games create a whole new focus for people to start thinking about these things again... and they can see the practical solutions we have on the site,\" he says. </p> <p>The recycling and energy and water conservation measures may offer a useful model for the western world, but the local legacy of the Olympics is patchy. The village is too far from the train station to encourage future residents to reduce their car use, while Homebush Bay remains polluted. </p> <p>The continued contamination of Rhodes Peninsula, adjacent to the Olympic site, is not the responsibility of the Olympic movement, stresses Bland. However, its clean-up was part of the Games package promised by the NSW government. </p> <p>Last Friday, to Greenpeace's dismay, the government announced that the tender for waste treatment would go to a consortium proposing to ship the pollutants to Queensland - \"a real let-down,\" says Palese, a proposal which violates the promise to treat waste on site. </p> <p>Greenpeace does praise Sydney 2000's green effort. But maintaining its standards is \"going to be difficult\" says Palese. In 2004, the Games return to Athens. \"It's not going to be anywhere near what Sydney was,\" she predicts. </p> <p>\"I hope Athens do as good a job as we've done,\" says Bland. \"Regardless of whether they do or they don't, Sydney has set a new benchmark on how to deal with the environment.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, beyond the Olympic walls, Homebush Bay is still so polluted that fishing is forbidden.</p>",
  "<p>Her flat is damp. It has no central heating. Pipes are \"constantly\" leaking. Now her one-year-old son has asthma. Charlotte can rattle off a long list of other complaints about high-rise living on the edge of Glasgow city centre. But like many tenants battered by bureaucracy's apparent inability to tackle basic repairs, she has given up hope.</p> <p>Even scaffolding, clamped to the side of the crumbling 60s structure, in a belated stab at installing double glazing, fails to impress the 22-year-old. \"They should knock this lot down instead of putting all these windows in,\" she says, a faint smile betraying deepening resignation. \"Everything here is bad, really bad. It's like the house that Jack built, freezing in the winter and damp in the summer. I hope to get out soon -to England.\" </p> <p>Across what passes for a square in the St George's Cross district, littered with rubble and broken glass (\"more wear and tear than vandalism - don't blame the weans [children],\" sighs a middle-aged woman) Gordon Dodd is walking his six-year-old son home in the late evening. While his low-rise flat nearby is in slightly better repair - \"although heating would be nice\" - he is under no illusions about the scale of the problem facing Britain's biggest council landlord. \"To be honest, half the houses in Glasgow need to be bulldozed and rebuilt. These big blocks of flats [the city has 150] are no use to man or beast. They're in a terrible condition.\" </p> <p>A mile away, surveying the city from his new office in Glasgow's business quarter, the man charged with sorting out a housing crisis would not disagree. \"The stock is in a hellish condition and everyone realises it is not fit for the 21st century, for the dignity of people who want to stay in their homes,\" admits Bob Allan, chief executive of the embryonic Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) and former head of a nearby local authority. \"It's saddled with debt, dampness, cold, poor electrics - everything far worse than the UK average.\" </p> <p>After years of defensiveness, no one in authority disputes that the city's 94,000 council flats and houses are among the worst in Britain. Only a quarter reach acceptable standards, while a further quarter are seen as \"saveable\". The remaining 50%, in areas like St George's Cross and elsewhere, are in such poor condition that they face an uncertain future in a city which, because of low demand, has been demolishing 2,300 council houses annually since 1993. </p> <p>Saddled with a housing debt approaching \u00a31bn and facing a repairs backlog of \u00a31.2bn for stock deteriorating by the day, Glasgow city council has thrown ideology to the wind. Memories of that old political cliche, Red Clydeside, may still linger in older hearts; after all, the government in 1919, fearing a Bolshevik uprising, put tanks on the streets outside the city chambers. </p> <p>But now the Labour pragmatists running the city chambers have decided to get rid of that monument to municipal socialism - council housing. In a move certain to set the pace for big English cities - notably Birmingham - it is preparing to hand over its entire stock to Allan's housing association next year, provided tenants vote \"yes\" in a city-wide ballot. </p> <p>The move has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for the Scottish executive and the young minister for communities, Wendy Alexander, whose enthusiasm and direct involvement - she co-chairs a steering group with councillors - has clearly ruffled feathers in the marbled city chambers. </p> <p>\"We have an opportunity to create a new, positive spirit in many communities,\" Alexander has said. \"From initial soundings with tenants' groups there is a genuine desire for constructive change. Tenants will lead the way throughout the entire process . . . this will be for the people of Glasgow, by the people of Glasgow.\" </p> <p>As part of the deal with the council, the executive has agreed to go one step further than its Whitehall equivalent by servicing Glasgow's housing debt from its own funds. Free of this financial albatross, the emerging GHA would then set about tackling the repairs backlog and (in Allan's words) \"rebuilding communities\". As debt repayment accounts for half the average weekly rent of \u00a345, this is no mean subsidy. </p> <p>The other attraction for the council, target of constant sniping from disgruntled tenants, is that housing associations, unlike local authorities, can get loans from banks and building societies - using the income stream from rents as collateral. As a result, the council hopes that institutions, including possibly the European Investment Bank, will help raise around \u00a31.6bn over 10 years to smarten up what remains of the former municipal stock. </p> <p>Both Alexander and the council are adamant that the GHA must be a non-profit making mutual association, controlled by communities and not by businessmen. After the ballot, the idea is to shift control to some 14 area organisations - and eventually fur ther down the chain to smaller associations of about 500 houses each. </p> <p>But assurances of mutuality have failed to halt criticism that the housing transfer smacks of backdoor privatisation. Tommy Sheridan, a Scottish Socialist Party councillor and a member of the Scottish Parliament, says opposition will match the great anti-poll tax campaign, which he led in the late 1980s. \"This will develop into a very bitter and bloody battle,\" he insists. \"There is a tremendous amount of fear. For the first time in modern history, Glasgow will be left without a council house if this goes through.\" </p> <p>Sean Clerkin, who chairs a Glasgow-wide campaign against stock transfer, claims the plan is not only a \"test bed for council house privatisation throughout the UK\", but also an issue which could seal Alexander's fate as a minister. \"It will either be her big success story,\" he says, \"or the noose that hangs her because she's that closely associated with it.\" </p> <p> Charlie Gordon, Labour leader of Glasgow, accepts the issue is so emotive that the council and the Scottish executive have some way to go in convincing 94,000 tenants. He says: \"There is a folk memory in Glasgow of what it was like renting from private landlords and older people [over a quarter of tenants are pensioners] remember exploitation and the rest of it.\" </p> <p>If a ballot were held tomorrow -rather than next year - Gordon accepts that the plan would be overwhelmingly rejected. \"This is a process and we are still in the early stages,\" he says, accusing opponents of being \"politically motivated dogmatists\", unwilling to accept plans for \"another form of social ownership\". </p> <p>Others are not so restrained. In a recent newsletter, produced on behalf of the council and the Scottish executive, critics were accused of feeding Glaswegians \"a diet of fear, half-truths and misinformation\" about rocketing rents, widespread redundancies, and privatisation. </p> <p>But with more than 2,000 staff in the housing department, and a further 3,000 employed by the council's direct labour organisation (DLO) - mainly on council house repairs - job losses are clearly a fear. That is why the Scottish TUC is opposed to the scheme, although job assurances, and a commitment to give a contract to the DLO after the transfer, will be given. Allan's next step will be formally to present a transfer package to the council by the end of the year, outlining investment and rent levels, the structure of his organisation and tenancy agreements. If the authority accepts, plans for a ballot will be set in train. </p> <p>To win hearts and minds, he says publicity material will have to be free of hype and spin. \"We have to do this in an honest and open way rather than as a smart piece of salesmanship.\" In the end, he believes they will get a \"yes\". \"But we will have to work hard for it.\" </p> <p>One thing is clear. If the vote goes against the council and the Scottish executive - so far, in smaller author ities, stock transfer ballots have exceeded general election turnouts - ministers will not let matters rest. \"The status quo is not an option,\" insists Allan. </p> <p>But in St George's Cross, and elsewhere, it is clear that the GHA has some explaining to do. \"I'm afraid they might make us go private,\" laments Jean Thomas, who has lived on the 11th floor of a block for 23 years. \"You hear so much about private landlords putting you out. We're all right the way we are, aren't we?\" </p> <p>Gordon Dodd isn't so sure. \"To be honest, I don't think there is an option. I'll vote yes. It's a bold step they're taking. I just hope housing remains an integral part of society in the future. I was with a private landlord before I got a council flat and wouldn't like to go back to that.\"</p> <p><strong>South of the border </strong></p> <p>In England, 450,000 houses have already been hived off, with 165,000 likely to follow in this financial year - although 3.2m still remain in council hands. But no big city has transferred its housing, largely because of uncertainties over huge debts. Birmingham, with a debt of \u00a3650m, is holding talks with the Department of the Environment, but the ruling Labour group is clearly divided on the issue. The Conservatives have accused unions, and Labour dissidents, of being at odds with the official line on transferring 92,000 homes - slightly fewer than Glasgow - to a series of social companies. </p> <p>While English ministers insist that councils will not be forced to get rid of their houses, the Chartered Institute of Housing has calculated that 200,000 homes annually will have to be transferred if the government is to meet its target of clearing a \u00a319bn repairs backlog in 10 years.</p> <p>But the scale of the challenge to win over tenants was illustrated last month at Wycombe district council, Buckinghamshire, when tenants opposed transferring 7,150 houses to a new social landlord in a postal ballot which registered a near 70% turnout.</p>",
  "William Hague mapped out the Tories' general election battle plan yesterday when he unveiled the party's \"mini-manifesto\" which combined hardline pledges to distance Britain from the European Union with softer commitments to tackle social divisions. <p>With less than a year to go until the expected date for the general election, the Tory leader dismissed recent polls to declare that his party could return to power once voters embrace his \"commonsense revolution\". </p> <p>Many of the details in the Tories' pre-election manifesto, including plans to end state funding of universities and to detain all asylum seekers, have already been leaked. </p> <p>But Mr Hague outlined a few surprises yesterday, including a plan to give young people the right to invest their state pension money into private schemes and a plan to end the health secretary's day-to-day role in running the NHS. </p> <p> </p> <p> <b> Pensions</b> </p> <p>Young people would be encouraged to save for retirement through a state-funded alternative to the basic state pension. Anyone who opts for the scheme would be given a sum of money each month -equivalent to the amount which would eventually fund their state pension - to place in a private or occupational scheme. </p> <p>The mini-manifesto said: \"We wish young people to build up a funded alternative to the basic pension for the future. No one would be forced to change. The basic state pension would continue to be paid as now, not merely to current pensioners but to people of working age and new entrants who want it in the future.\" </p> <p> <b> Health service</b> </p> <p>The NHS would be transformed by ending direct political control of the health service, ending centrally imposed waiting lists and encouraging greater use of the private sector. Pledging to take \"politicians out of day-to-day management of the NHS\", the document said: \"The secretary of state's role will be to set a strategic framework of health policy, agree funding and guarantee minimum standards of quality.\" </p> <p>Patients would be given a maximum waiting time \"based exclusively on their medical need\". The document added: \"That time will be determined by their consultant and will meet the the individual patient's circumstances, not an arbitrary average. The health authority will be required either itself to treat the patient within that waiting time, or to arrange for the patient to be treated in another health authority or to pay for treatment in the independent sector.\" </p> <p> <b> Economy</b> </p> <p>The document confirmed that Mr Hague has abandoned his guarantee to reduce taxes regardless of the state of the economy. Instead the Tories have pledged to cut taxes if the economic conditions are right. </p> <p>It said: \"We will be a tax cutting government - in all normal circumstances we will reduce the burden of taxation. Such a policy is economically right and it is morally right.\" </p> <p>The Tories pledged to match Labour spending in health and education, but to cut spending in other areas. The document said: \"Government cannot spend what the nation hasn't earnt. It is not sustainable for government spending to grow faster than national income.\" </p> <p> <b> Europe</b> </p> <p>Mr Hague reiterated his pledge to oppose the European single currency for the lifetime of the next parliament. He also promised to oppose moves towards a \"fully integrated superstate\" by introducing new legislation to prevent EU law from overriding the will of parliament, except in areas ceded by Westminster. </p> <p>The document said: \"Down one road lies a fully integrated superstate, with nation states and the national veto disappearing. This is the route down which Britain is gradually disappearing. The alternative route, our route, is to a Europe of nations combining in different combinations for different purposes and to a different extent, a network of Europe.\" </p> <p> <b> Law and order</b> </p> <p>A war \"as never before\" would be waged against criminals. The Tories pledged to reverse the cuts in police numbers; overhaul the law in favour of the likes of the Norfolk farmer Tony Martin who was jailed for murdering a burglar; abolish the early release scheme; and to hand out mandatory sentences to drug dealers who sell to children. </p> <p>\"Crime is rising again and yet there are fewer police,\" the document said. \"Violent crime is soaring and yet thousands of violent offenders have been released early from jail. The mainstream majority thinks that government is too often on the side of the criminal rather than the victim.\" </p> <p> <b> Education</b> </p> <p>Central control over education would be ended by funding schools directly and using government auctions to set up multi-billion pound endowments to fund Britain's universities. </p> <p>The document said: \"Too much central political interference is damaging standards in our schools. Parents instinctively know what makes a good school. It is a place with an enthusiasm for learning and with a strong ethos and values. We want to give schools the freedom to become such places.\" </p> <p> <b> Inner cities</b> </p> <p>Britain's inner cities would become \"attractive, clean and crime-free places\" through a series of \"radical new approaches\". The worst tower blocks will be pulled down and new laws will be introduced to crack down on \"bad neighbours\". </p> <p> <b> Family</b> </p> <p>The Tories will attempt to win back their reputation as the party of the family by restoring the married couples' tax allowance. They would also introduce \"family scholarships\" to help parents to retrain when they return to work after taking a break to look after their children. </p> <p>Mr Hague said his proposals amounted to an ambitious alternative for Britain which the British people would embrace. \"Believing in Britain is a striking new social agenda for Conservatism based on one very simple, very Conservative principle: freedom,\" Mr Hague said. \"Freedom for parents, for families, for pensioners, for teachers and doctors and nurses.\" </p> <p> <b>Main points:</b> <br></p> <p>\u0095 Young people to be provided with state-funded alternative to basic state pension </p> <p>\u0095 Health secretary to be deprived of day to day role in running the NHS and centrally-imposed waiting lists to be dropped </p> <p>\u0095 Taxes to be cut \"in all normal circumstances\". Tories would match Labour funding on health and education, but cut spending in other areas </p> <p>\u0095 Pound would be saved for lifetime of next parliament as Tories oppose moves to \"fully integrated superstate\" </p> <p>\u0095 Fall in police numbers to be reversed and prisoner early release scheme to be abolished</p>",
  "Thousands of rioting refugees and pro-Indonesian militia members attacked a UN office in West Timor today, killing at least three foreign UN aid workers, the Indonesian military and witnesses said. <p>Sergeant Joseph Carvalo said an angry crowd beat the three to death and then burned their bodies along with a car in front of the UN office in the border town of Atambua.</p> <p>The murdered victims were foreigners but their nationalities were not immediately known. However, Sergeant Carvalo said a Brazilian UN worker was also badly injured. </p> <p>UN peacekeepers in neighbouring East Timor were preparing to enter Indonesian-controlled West Timor to evacuate other UN workers trapped in Atambua. </p> <p>But Australian army Captain Dan Hurron, attached with one unit in the East Timor border town of Suai, said a UN force would only enter with Indonesia's permission. </p> <p>Officials at the headquarters of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in West Timor's capital, Kupang, said contact had been lost with its besieged office in Atambua. </p> <p>UN spokesman Jake Morland said there were serious fears for their safety. He said 90 other UNHCR staff in West Timor were on standby for possible evacuation in case the violence spread across the province. </p> <p>It was not immediately clear why the violence flared or why the UN workers were targeted. However, witnesses said some crowd members accused the United Nations of ignoring their plight. </p> <p>The UN agency has been delivering aid to an estimated 90,000 refugees who have lingered in border in camps after fleeing violence in East Timor 12 months ago. </p> <p>It has regularly complained that militia gangs, opposed to East Timor's independence from Indonesia, have attacked its staff and buildings in West Timor over many months. </p> <p>Caravel said today's riot erupted a day after the murder of a refugee in the nearby town of Betun. He and other witnesses said as many as 3,000 mourners took the man's body to Atambua and staged a protest outside the UNHCR's office. </p> <p>About 250,000 East Timorese fled East Timor for dozens of border refugee camps in West Timor a year ago to escape violence by Indonesian troops and their militia allies who opposed a UN-supervised vote for East Timor's independence. </p> <p>The United Nations along with other foreign officials complain that anti-independence militiamen are using the West Timor camps as border incursion bases and safe havens. </p> <p>Under pressure to stop escalating border violence, Indonesia has repeatedly promised to close the camps.</p>",
  "<p>FX Toole talks like he writes. Rapidly and saltily. He is 70 years old, is just off the plane and his hearing aid is playing up. But he is unstoppable - on bullfighting, boxing and writing, the Hemingway-esque trinity which has shaped his life and seen a heart-warming late literary flowering. We meet at a gym in east London and, after a couple of hours in his ebullient company, I feel I have gone 10 rounds with a champ, light on his feet but punching heavy, like the prose in Toole's debut book, Rope Burns. </p> <p>Rope Burns is a collection of short stories that draws on Toole's experiences in boxing. James Ellroy has called the book \"a hymn to ferocious longing and loss\" and described it as \"the best boxing short fiction ever written\". It is visceral and violent; written in a rhythmic street language that, in the great American tradition, manages to be both uncompromising and elegiac. It is, on all counts, a pretty good first round for a 70-year-old, worth his 50-year-wait to get published. </p> <p>Where to start with Toole? He seems to encapsulate America. Irish father and \"brought up Irish\" - the FX stands for Francis Xavier; Californian country-girl mother; child of the Depression; brief stint in the navy; trained to be an actor (his brother became an opera singer) but wanted to write too and read avidly. One day he read Hemingway's Death in the Afternoon and had a vision of his future life. </p> <p>\"I was fed up with theatre people. I came upon Death in the Afternoon and said 'here it is, here's the real thing, here's the true drama'. I gave up acting and became a bullfighter, and I got the living shit kicked out of me.\" </p> <p>Toole moved to Mexico and became fluent in Spanish. But he soon realised that it was already too late; though only in his mid-20s, he was too old. \"I was a pretty good bullfighter, but I didn't have the skills to get out of the way. A good writer - it's not only what he puts in, it's what he leaves out, right? with a good fighter, it's not only what he takes to it, it's how he gets away. I had to take chances that someone 16 would not be expected to take.\" He got gored three times, ran out of money, and after two years, headed back to the US- with a new wife and daughter. </p> <p>Maybe age imposes a seamlessness on life, but Toole's struggles have barely made a mark on his spirit. His body is in pretty good shape, too, considering the goring, the boxing, and open-heart surgery 10 years ago. There is clearly something to be said for avoiding publishers' lunches until your 70s. </p> <p>Toole is vague about the 20 years following his return to California. Two more marriages (\"three strikes and now I'm out\"); construction work; lots of bar tending, a good place to hone both survival skills and story-telling instincts; and writing, writing, writing: an \"LSD novel\", a play in which a pair of Doberman pinschers play key roles, but nothing that came even remotely close to being published. </p> <p>Lesser men would have despaired. In fact, it sounds like even Toole despaired. \"I didn't have the heart for it. The reason I didn't have the heart for it is that I didn't have my soul. It took open-heart surgery to give me my soul back; it gave me the heart to put up with rejection.\" In Missouri in 1996, a boxing story, The Monkey Look, \"popped\" into Toole's head. He wrote it, a magazine accepted it, Secker and Warburg editor Geoff Mulligan read it and commissioned Rope Burns, which is being published simultaneously in the UK and US. There has even been Hollywood interest, though Toole already seems to have latched on to the fact that film optioners fight dirtier than ageing heavyweights. </p> <p>Though Toole has always loved boxing, he came late to the professional game. \"I was 45, living in California; I'm watching the fights every week and all of a sudden the skies part and I think I'm going to learn how to do this. I had no illusions about being a fighter; I wanted to understand how they did it, mechanically, psychically and mentally. That was the great adventure.\" </p> <p>He found a trainer called Dub Huntley, who was so sure that Toole would give up he trained him for nothing. Toole didn't go away. He was way too old to fight, but not too old to work as a cornerman. Huntley was tied up one evening and asked Toole to work the corner for one of his fighters in an amateur contest in LA. Toole reluctantly agreed and it was love at first fight. \"I fell in love right there, from the inside out. It was from the outside in before; now it's the inside out.\" </p> <p>He became a fight junkie. \"There's nothing like it in the world. It's like bullfighting: you're living right on the edge. I'll fly anywhere. Where's the fight? I'll go.\" He became an expert in treating cuts and travelled all over the US, and to Europe and South Africa, working corners. </p> <p>In the introduction to Rope Burns, Toole reflects on this love affair: \"I began to learn and to understand what had drawn me to boxing as a boy. It was the science of fighting, and the heart it takes to be a fighter. Boxing was an exercise of the mind. I also began to realise that, despite my age, I was someone who could play the game. I was spellbound. I still am. God has blessed me with the sweet science.\" </p> <p>Rope Burns depicts the brutality and crookedness of fighting, the viciousness of LA street life, the desperate circumstances of many boxers. Toole wants to distance himself from writers such as Norman Mailer, who, Toole says, have written about boxing from the outside and in the process romanticised it. </p> <p>\"What happens so often is, 'look at me, look how much I know about boxing', as opposed to 'what's the subject that we're dealing with?' I have this tremendous insight into this hermetically sealed world, which they don't; they don't know their ass. Mailer trained and for a while he was trying to get into fights with people. The writer as tough guy. Fuck that. You fight for money or you fight because someone comes through the window of your house. Some writer comes up and says 'let's go fight'; get lost.\" </p> <p>But for all the desperation, the fact that Toole portrays a Fat City-style world of bruisers and losers, there is a kind of innocent beauty in the book too: the love of the trainer for his charge; the common search for identity, for - key word in boxing - respect; the way two men who have brutalised each other will hug at the end; the realisation that the higher you go, the further you can fall. </p> <p>Toole mentions, in passing, a fighter called Frankie \"Too Sweet\" Jennings, a handsome man in his youth (hence Too Sweet), now so busted up he can hardly make himself understood. A good argument against boxing, I suggest. Toole doesn't get the full freight of the question. Jennings was talented, he says, but he didn't train properly, was out of condition, got hit too often. Now you just want to hug him, hold him. </p> <p>But boxing wrecks lives, I say loudly, to make sure the hearing aid is working, and he gets the counter-punch. He throws a combination. \"There is more barbarity in corporate America than there is in boxing. More lives are destroyed in business than in boxing. They kill more jockeys in America than fighters. The physical part of boxing is incidental to the mental part. I hope I've portrayed that in the book. You have to be tough to be a boxer, but it's not about being tough, it's about being smart. In bullfighting, one of the worst things they can say to a young bullfighter is 'you're brave, you've got balls'. Bullfighters want to be artists. The greatest of all was Pedro Romero. He was in 7,000 bullfights and he never shed a drop of blood. That's a good bullfighter.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Rope Burns is published tomorrow by Secker and Warburg (\u00a310)</p>",

  "<p>The past is a foreign country - they do things differently there,\" to quote a film that was famous in the 70s. I'm not sure about the 70s themselves, though: sometimes they seem like another planet. The decade certainly seems alien in the current crop of TV shows, such as BBC2's I Love the 70s, in which talking heads tenderly recall our past passions. Can it be that we really sat glued to Starsky and Hutch, wore lip gloss, bought Brotherhood of Man records? Or rather, did we really enjoy these things for real, without ironic hindsight? </p> <p>The true cause of our nostalgia is that we perceive the 70s as the last period in Britain when it was possible to enjoy popular culture at first hand - that is, without mediating layers of commentary. This was a last breather before the advent of the sort of style journalism that dissected and ironised pop culture. </p> <p>Sometimes, however, the past seems less like another country than just two doors down the street - which is what makes Channel 5's That 70s Show so perplexing. Created by Terry and Bonnie Turner, originators of Third Rock From the Sun, this retro sitcom keeps telling us that things are happening in another world. Yet everything looks familiar. Squint a little, and Eric and his teen buddies from Point Place, Wisconsin, could be modern high-schoolers. </p> <p>The real anachronistic skewiness is left to the parents. Girl-next-door Donna's parents are period pieces: a Danny De Vito clone in a frizzy perm and a bona fide ex-Charlie's Angel (Tanya Roberts). But Eric's folks embody a stranger time slip: Dad is a stuffy authoritarian, Mom is protective and fussy, at one point suffering a paranoid vision of the kids going wild when left alone in the house (dressing as blaxploitation pimps and failing to use table mats). Otherwise, they seem like 70s parents only in the sense that they are really a hangover from stuffy 50s sitcom parents. And that is the joke - they are an anachronism within an anachronism, straight out of Happy Days. </p> <p>Happy Days was a 70s phenomenon par excellence, in that nostalgia was a central obsession of the era. Just as we reinvent the 70s, that decade re-created other eras after its own image. To get its period right, That 70s Show would have to refer to 50s revivalist rocker bands like Sha-Na-Na; Eric's gang would have to adulate the Fonz, or decorate their rooms with 20s retro mirrors. </p> <p>That 70s Show is not particularly funny, but the creakiness is part of the joke. If the show mostly feels like a stiff, run-of-the-mill sitcom, that is actually an ironic play on the sitcoms that its characters would have watched. </p> <p>There's a huge difference between That 70s Show and those British 70s shows. In our own retro programmes, the past looks absolutely other, a tawdry world of brightly coloured nostalgic kitsch - Clangers dolls, CB radio, Sex Pistols singles. But That 70s Show suggests a strangely familiar America. That is because the programme's allusions are not really to the 70s at all, but to late-90s reflections of the 70s. The show draws on ideas and images in the air today - the retro repertoire of films such as The Ice Storm, Dazed and Confused, The Brady Bunch Movie. That 70s Show is not much cop as a spoof of the 70s, but as a pastiche of our turn-of-the-century fantasies of the age, it's at least remarkably thorough. Still, I doubt I'll be reminiscing fondly about it in 20 years' time. </p> <p>\u0095 That 70s Show is on Channel 5 on Mondays at 7pm.</p>",
  "I was one of the lucky ones to get into the Oval on Monday, and it was a tremendous experience (Now cricket's come home, after 31 years, September 5). I only wish I could have bottled and sold the atmosphere: fervent support for the home side without (as far as I could tell) xenophobia or drunken loutishness; strangers on the tube to and from the ground talking to one another; children, who couldn't find their seats in the packed stands after a visit to the loo or to buy an ice cream, being ushered back by unknown grown ups who had noticed them on the steps. <p>All right, being generous in applause to members of the side your team is beating doesn't cost, but the reception given to Ambrose and Walsh was quite something.

  "Jill Selbourne, who has died aged 54 after a spirited resistance to cancer, was a Labour councillor in Conservative Westminster and one of the leaders of the campaign against gerrymandering there. A radical campaigner among London's poor and underprivileged over several decades, she had represented the impoverished Harrow Road ward since 1986. <p>Selbourne was an inspirational woman of great charm and humour and a tenacious and imaginative political fighter along the difficult urban frontiers of race and class. She had a capacity for creating friendships and getting people together socially as well as politically. </p> <p>Like so many people in the Labour Party, she could be categorised neither as \"Old Labour\" nor as \"New Labour\": she perceived herself simply as a socialist, an anti-racist, an internationalist and someone who thought for herself. Her politics was rooted in community activism, working with black and refugee groups in the north of the borough, and helping to galvanise local communities. </p> <p>Further afield, a visit to the Caribbean island of Dominica, where many of north Paddington's inhabitants come from, left her with a permanent enthusiasm for its way of life. She would often return there, and helped to set up the Frontline Cooperative Bookshop in Roseau, the capital, in 1982, the island's first - and still surviving - independent bookshop. </p> <p>Selbourne was born in Devon but her family later farmed along the Ridgeway on the Wiltshire Downs, where she spent much of her childhood and frequently returned to recharge her batteries in later life. She was educated in Norfolk and in Somerset, and joined the sixth form of Marlborough grammar school before graduating with a first in anthropology from Sussex University. </p> <p>Travelling in India inspired an interest in the sub-continent's religions, a commitment to the politics of the wider world and a zeal to effect change, both in Britain and abroad. On her return, she completed her formal education by studying for an MA at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, and then in 1969 began working with the Community Development Project in Southwark. </p> <p>Moving to north Paddington in 1973, she worked as a community development officer with Voluntary Action Westminster, finding in community regeneration and the empowerment of deprived and dispossessed people her own reason for existence. She relished the area's multi-racial, multi-cultural life, and for many years at the Notting Hill carnival would appear in carnival costume during the day and then dance furiously behind the floats until closing time. </p> <p>For many years her spare time was spent working with YaaAsantewa, the black arts centre off the Harrow Road named after the great Ashanti queen. Started in 1973, and originally known as the Factory, it occupied former industrial premises which Jill campaigned to acquire for use as a community centre. She was its indefatigable supporter through several crises. </p> <p>As a councillor in 1986 and chairwoman of the Labour group on the Westminster council housing committee, she was the prime mover, successfully opposing plans to sell off the council's housing estates. Helping to channel the creative energies of the people involved, she was instrumental in starting the resident-controlled Walterton and Elgin Community Homes housing association, which assumed responsibility for some of the old estates. </p> <p>More recently, as developers made plans for the gigantic site once occupied by Paddington station's goods yards, Selbourne took a lead in organising the local community to demand a say in what would happen there. The result was the creation of the Paddington Development Trust, which involves schools and colleges, health trusts and residents' associations and secured a \u00a313m government grant, the largest new funding ever brought into one of central London's most deprived areas. </p> <p>Late in 1998, at the height of her powers and with many ambitions still unfulfilled, Selbourne was diagnosed with malignant melanoma, and she resisted it with characteristic determination. Eventually, when it became clear that this was one battle she would not win, she accepted her fate without fear and drew great strength from her many friends and family, and from her own deep spiritual reserves. </p> <p>She leaves two daughters, Jane and Sally, and two granddaughters, and her long-time partner, Neale Coleman, whom she married two weeks before her death. </p> <p>Jill Selbourne, political campaigner, born February 25 1946; died August 31 2000</p>",
  "For months Angelica Ramirez hoped against hope that the changes in her body were caused by the shock of the rape. Eventually, when she could fool herself no more, alone and frightened, she tried to induce an abortion. <p>\"I thought if I don't eat, it will die. I thought if I do the exercises and take pills and special herbs I will abort the baby, but nothing worked. Nothing happened.\" </p> <p>Desperate, she approached a doctor, who agreed to do the operation. But she could not afford his fee; so, with her mother's help, she left her small-town home to have the baby in a city orphanage, so that her father would not find out. </p> <p>\"I know it's not the child's fault, but every night I ask the baby why it had to be born, why I had to have it. That's why I want to give it up for adoption. That's why I don't want the baby ever to know that I am its mother,\" she said, a shy teenager shaking in a failed attempt to control her tears. </p> <p>The taboo that led her to pretend her pregnancy was not happening has deterred politicians on all sides from touching the abortion issue. </p> <p>Women's groups estimate that 850,000 Mexican women abort every year, and about 1,000 are thought to die from botched jobs. These statistics do not even recognise cases such as Angelica's. </p> <p>But in the past few months Mexico has been taken by storm by a national debate on unwanted pregnancies and abortion which, although begun by the religious right - newly emboldened by its links to the president elect Vincente Fox's National Action party (Pan) - has given the pro-choice camp a public platform it was previously denied. </p> <p>\"We have the opportunity to do something different,\" said Ricardo Sheffield, one of the Pan deputies who passed an amendment to the penal code in the state of Guanajuato designed to make abortion, even in cases of rape, punishable with prison. </p> <p>\"The damage of rape can be repaired, but killing by abortion - there is no resolving that.\" </p> <p>Rosario Taracena, an activist for reproductive rights, said the extreme right posed a very real threat, but the feminist movement had long been pushing for the chance to talk openly about abortion and the restrictive laws and cultural taboos which ensured that the most abortions were performed in secret. </p> <p>The Guanajuato bill caused a furore, not only because rape is one of the very few conditions under which abortion is legal in all Mexican states but also because it brought to the surface the deep contradiction between Mexico's Catholic sensibilities and its strong anti-clerical tradition, which abhors mixing religion and politics. </p> <p>It also came soon after the case of Paulina, a 13-year-old rape victim whose attempt to get a legal abortion was blocked by politicians, lawyers and doctors in the northern state of Baja California ,where the Pan is also very strong. The case was given extensive and sympathetic treatment by Mexico's main television network, Televisa. </p> <p>It also deeply embarrassed Mr Fox. A previous governor of the particularly religious state, he had worked hard to distance himself from Pan's rightwing image. But his victory breathed new life into the fundamentalists in the party. </p> <p>The new aggressiveness of the pro-lifers prompted left-leaning parties to pass liberalising amendments to the abortion laws of Mexico City and the state of Morelos. Although hardly radical, they indicated a readiness to pick up the gauntlet thrown down by the extreme right in Pan. </p> <p>Under pressure to calm the situation, the governor of Guanajuato, a close associate of Mr Fox, vetoed the reform at the end of last month. But the state's deputies have vowed to raise the issue again at a later date. </p> <p>\"The debate has only just begun,\" s Mr Sheffield said. \"Mr Fox says this will go no further, but he is not a congressman. We have been raised as opposition, and it is in our blood.\" </p> <p>\"It was to be expected that the religious right would do something like this,\" said Edgar Gonzalez, a researcher, who stressed that the Pan, founded in 1939, had its roots in the Cristera war 10 years earlier between a reactionary church and the new revolutionary anti-clerical state. </p> <p>Pan has broadened its appeal over theyears, but Mr Gonzalez said the fundamentalists had remained, awaiting the right opportunity to push their agenda. </p> <p>\"There is nothing to indicate that they are going to give up so easily now,\"he said </p> <p>There is also nothing to suggest that those who want women to be free to chose abortion will simply accept a quiet return to the status quo. </p> <p>\"What we want is for the debate to continue until we get a national referendum,\" said Veronica Cruz, a leading Guanajuato feminist, encouraged but not satisfied by the veto of the rape reform bill. </p> <p>Meanwhile nobody doubts that whatever the law says, women will seek out ways to abort. For those with money and contacts it can be as simple as a visit to a discrete doctor, but for many it is a matter of noxious concoctions and sharp objects. </p> <p>And it is business as usual in Mexico City's Sonora market. </p> <p>\"How many weeks?\" a vendor asked to gauge the required dose of a herbal remedy he promised would start the bleeding within five hours. </p> <p>\"I only sell to women who are up to three months late, after that it gets dangerous, but for enough money you can always get someone to help you out.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Abigail Morris was named artistic director of the Soho Theatre in 1992, some of her friends advised her against taking the job. The Soho, originally called the Soho Poly and founded as a lunchtime theatre by Verity Bargate and Frederick Proudin 1968, was one of London's first fringe venues and gave many famous writers their big break, from Barrie Keefe to Sue Townsend. But by the early 90s the company appeared to be in freefall. If Morris took the job, she might see her fledgling career go down with it. </p> <p>Now Morris sits in the meeting room at the top of a new \u00a310.5m theatre in Dean Street in the heart of Soho, having guided the company through its first season in its purpose-built home. At least 80% of seats have been sold for each production; a remarkable 73% of audience members were under the age of 35; the final play, Stop Kiss, had its run extended by two weeks; and Amanda Whittington's Be My Baby, about life in a home for unmarried mothers in the 1960s, is heading for the West End. </p> <p>This is not the first time Morris has pulled a rabbit out of the hat. In 1993, against the advice of those who predicted a marketing disaster, she followed her instincts and programmed Diane Samuels's Jewish refugee drama Kindertransport, which became a hit both in the West End and on Broadway. The same year, when she accepted a production of Jonathan Lewis's soldier drama Our Boys, theatres that had rejected it phoned her up to inform her that she was mad. Our Boys later transferred to the Donmar Warehouse. Even the decision to open the Dean Street theatre not with fanfares but with a low-key season of new work has paid off. </p> <p>But perhaps her greatest coup was persuading her bosses that a company with barely two pennies to rub together should buy its own building. In just eight years the Soho has gone from bust to boom, and Morris, whose only previous experience was running the feminist theatre company Trouble and Strife in the late 1980s, has become a major player in Britain's new-play culture. Any list of those most likely to shape Britain's theatre in the 21st century would be incomplete without Morris and the Soho's administrative director, Mark Godfrey. Some predict that this is a partnership to match that of Richard Eyre and David Aukin, who worked together in regional theatre before running the National. By coincidence, Aukin chairs the Soho's board. </p> <p>\"I had nothing to lose,\" Morris says of her decision to take the job at the Soho. Yet within weeks of arriving she found herself having to persuade the Arts Council not to withdraw its funding. Two years later the end once again appeared imminent when the company faced eviction from the Cockpit Theatre, an unlovely venue in north London where it had moved after being pushed out of the centre of the city in 1990. </p> <p>But Morris, small and wiry, is as tenacious as a terrier. She suggested to the board that the company find and convert its own building in central London. Someone spluttered that they'd probably need \u00a3100,000 - way beyond the ambitions and pocket of a small company like Soho. If the board members had known that the final cost would be 100 times as much, they would probably all have had heart attacks. </p> <p>But the timing could not have been better. Capital grants were just becoming available via the Lottery, and the Soho seized on the old synagogue in Dean Street, snatching it from the clutches of a company that wanted to turn it into a lap-dancing club. Then, when property prices in the capital went through the roof, the Soho did a deal with a developer that gave it a 200-seat theatre and writers' centre in return for the right to build flats above the venue. A restaurant covers the theatre's running costs, putting the company in the rare position of spending its subsidy on producing work rather than keeping the toilets clean. </p> <p>At \u00a3253,000, the Soho's grant is less than Hampstead Theatre's or the Bush's, and insufficient for a theatre with such an ambitious new writers' programme. But the company's first season in its new home has already had a major impact on the delicate ecology of new writing, and Morris's distinctive taste has provided a refreshing counter to the brutalism of so much new work. </p> <p>\"In the end choosing a play is very much like choosing a friend. You have a hunch,\" says Morris, whose \"hunches\" last season included eight plays, all box-office hits, of which six were written by women. There was no specific plan in this, but Morris may once again be ahead of the crowd. In the mid-90s she was one of the first programmers to realise that the modern theatre-goer has a preference for 90-minute mini-dramas rather than four-hour epics. (She claims only to have been reflecting her own short attention span.) </p> <p>Taken as a group, the astonishing thing about the plays in the first Soho season is that they pulled in audiences simply by focusing on the pain and pleasures of ordinary people leading ordinary lives. Morris is not afraid of the kind of violence that has become fashionable in the theatre (Alex Jones's Noise, staged when the Soho was camping out in the Dean Street synagogue before building was completed, was as uncomfortable and brutal as theatre gets) but the plays she chooses are less about shocking and more about telling stories. Even Noise sprang from that most common of situations - neighbours arguing about noise levels. </p> <p>Morris is reluctant to talk about either motherhood (she has two girls under five, making her that rarest of creatures, a female artistic director with small children) or religion (she is a practising Jew and won't work late on Fridays). But both seem to influence her choice of plays and her desire to tell stories. \"Telling stories is such a good way of drawing people in. It engages people on a deep level. It creates a dialogue and enables people,\" says Morris, who cites the story of her friend's parents, Polish Jews, who were hidden throughout the war by a woman who was anti-Semitic. \"I am interested in those kinds of stories, and theatre is a really good way of exploring the contradictions in people - their very many facets. People are complicated. It is not as simple as saying that Iago is more interesting than Othello.\" </p> <p>Certainly it is not the case in Morris's latest production, Navy Pier, a play about writing, ambition and creative and intellectual ownership, which opens the Soho's second season this week. Like almost all of the Soho's plays, this is theatre that approaches its subject slightly off centre but with a nose for accessibility. The chances are that it will be yet another hit. But Morris is taking no bets. \"In the theatre you can't ever second-guess, and in a way that is great. It means that however successful you become, you should never lose the freedom to go out on a limb, to say, 'That's the play that speaks to me, and that's the one I'm going to put on.' \" </p> <p>\u0095 Navy Pier is at the Soho Theatre, London W1 (020-7478 0100), from Thursday.</p>"
