  "The term \"British\" has racial connotations and will no longer serve as a description of the UK's multicultural society, says a report by an influential think-tank launched today. <p> Its conclusion that the UK should be formally recognised as a multicultural society whose history needs to be \"revised, rethought or jettisoned\" yesterday attracted fierce criticism from Conservative MPs who said it was an affront to the \"native British\" who needed to stand up for themselves. But Labour ministers have promised to study its findings in detail and are likely to give it a warm welcome. </p> <p>The Runnymede Trust-sponsored Commission into the Future of Multi-ethnic Britain whose report is to be launched by the home secretary, Jack Straw, also suggests it is time to review the privileged position of the Anglican church in public life and to take measures to boost the number of black and Asian faces in parliament. </p> <p>But it is a short section on \"the future of Britishness\" in the 400-page report which has sparked most controversy. The report of the commission, chaired by Lord Parekh, Labour peer and political scientist, says devolution, the Good Friday agreement and globalisation have undermined the notion of Britishness. </p> <p>It rejects \"Englishness\" as alternative: \"To be English, as the term is in practice used, is to be white. Britishness is not ideal, but at least it appears acceptable, particularly when suitably qualified - Black British, Indian British, British Muslim and so on. </p> <p>\"However, there is one major and so far insuperable barrier. Britishness, as much as Englishness, has systematic largely unspoken, racial con notations. Whiteness nowhere features as an explicit condition of being British, but it is widely understood that Englishness, and therefore by extension Britishness is racially coded. </p> <p>\"There ain't no black in the union jack,\" it has been said, quotes the report, which says there is an assumption that whiteness and Britishness go together like roast beef and yorkshire pudding. </p> <p>The failure to include in the national curriculum a rewritten history of Britain as an imperial force involving dominance in Ireland, Africa, the Caribbean and Asia, is proving to be an unmitigated disaster, the report claims. It argues that racial and cultural differences have been symbolically \"written out of the national story\". The wide-ranging report also calls for the establishment of a human rights commission, for action on discriminatory police stop and search policies and for the scrapping of the voucher system for asylum seekers. </p> <p>It says it is also time to review the connections between church and state. Such a review would have to look at how other religions are discriminated against in \"customs related to civic religion, for example daily prayers at Westminster and various religious ceremonies, including memorial events, in local government; the law of blasphemy; and the coronation oath\". </p> <p>Gerald Howarth, the Tory MP for Aldershot and a member of the Commons home affairs select committee, claimed the report represented social engineering on a massive scale. \"It is an extraordinary affront to the 94% of the population which is not from ethnic minorities. The native British must stand up for themselves.\" </p> <p>Lord Tebbit, the former Tory party chairman, claimed the greatest conflicts in the world were the product of multicultural societies such as Yugoslavia, Sri Lanka and the former Soviet Union. </p> <p>\"Since no one is being held hostage in this kingdom and those who arrived recently have come to get away from their own countries and enjoy the benefits of this country, the best way forward is integration rather than separation into cultural ghettoes.\"</p>",
  "England, Scotland and Wales are at a turning point in their history. They could become narrow and inward looking, with rifts between themselves and among their regions and communities, or they could develop as a \"community of citizens and communities\". <p>Many customary images of Britain are England-centred - indeed southern England-centred - and leave many millions of people out of the picture. </p> <p>More and more people have multiple identities - they are Welsh Europeans, Pakistani Yorkshirewomen, Glaswegian Muslims, English Jews. </p> <p>Diversity gives Britain important opportunities in world markets. Yet the opportunity is in danger of being squandered through racism and exclusion. </p> <p>Aggressive hostility to Islam is expressed in ways unthinkable in relation to other beliefs. The state's attitude to asylum seekers sends a shiver down many spines. Stories of murders, injustices and outrages haunt many people's memories. </p> <p>People in Britain have many differences, but they inhabit the same space and share the same future. All have a role in the collective project of fashioning Britain as an outward-looking, generous, inclusive society. </p> <p>A state is not only a territorial and political entity, but also an \"imagined community\". A genuinely multicultural Britain urgently needs to reimagine itself. </p> <p>Among other things, such reimagining must take account of the inescapable changes of the last 30 years - not only postwar migration but also devolution, globalisation, the end of empire, Britain's long-term decline as a world power, moral and cultural pluralism and closer integration with Europe. </p> <p>\"Community\" is a tricky term. All communities are changing and all are complex, with internal diversities and disagreements. There are also many overlaps, borrowings and two-way influences - no community is or can be insulated from all others. </p> <p>Hybrid cultural forms have emerged, especially in music and the arts. In this context, does \"Britishness\" have a future? Some believe devolution, globalisation and the new cultural diversity have undermined it irretrievably. </p> <p>The government has stated that it is committed \"to creating one nation\". What values and loyalties must be shared by communities and individuals in one nation? </p> <p>Most theoretical debates on such issues in Britain have been between what may be called nationalist and liberal theories of society. </p> <p>Under the nationalist model, the state promotes a single national culture and expects all to assimilate it. People who do not or cannot assimilate are second-class citizens. </p> <p>Under the liberal model, there is a single political culture in the public sphere, but substantial diversity in the private lives of citizens. </p> <p>A third model is the pluralist one which rejects a hard and fast distinction between public and private spheres and envisages that the public realm should be continually revised to accommodate cultural diversity in society at large. </p> <p>This model is to be found in multicultural societies such as Canada, Australia, Malaysia and India. </p> <p>The need now is for debates between liberal and pluralist theories. Britain should develop both as a community of citizens [the liberal view] and as a community of communities [the pluralist view]. </p> <p>A more ceremonious form of welcome for new British citizens might help everyone reflect on the value of citizenship. </p> <p>As far as racism is concerned, hostility that uses skin colour and physical appearance as markers of supposed difference does not represent the whole picture. </p> <p>There is also hostility using markers connected with culture, language and religion. A distinction needs also to be drawn between overt racism and institutional racism. </p> <p>Differentials in income and life-chances between black, Asian and Irish people and the rest of the population must be tackled. </p> <p>Sixty per cent of people of Bangladeshi or Pakistani origin live in poverty. More than half of African-Caribbean and African people live in districts with the highest rates of unemployment. </p> <p>Also, entirely independently of ethnicity, there must be progress to cut differentials in the general population between regions and neighbourhoods. </p> <p>Negotiations over contested issues - for example, the content of the national curriculum, the wearing of religious clothing at work - cannot take place in an ethical vacuum. They require ground rules that provide a minimum guarantee of protection for individuals and a framework for handling conflicts of interest. </p> <p>Such ground rules are provided in part by international human rights standards. </p> <p>The country's criminal justice system must on the one hand deal with racist crime with the utmost vigour; on the other, it must engage in its own processes with the utmost professionalism and fairness and with the minimum of damage to wider relationships and public trust. </p> <p>There is a growing body of data showing that black and Irish people are treated differentially at all stages of the criminal justice process, and that they are disproportionately likely to be imprisoned. </p> <p>In education, monitoring by ethnicity is inadequate or non-existent. There are substantial inequalities affecting, in particular, pupils and students from African-Caribbean, Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities. </p> <p>The cultural fabric of a society expresses ideas of who \"we\" are. The media has an essential role to play. </p> <p>The NHS depends...on the contributions of Asian, black and Irish doctors, nurses, managers and ancillary staff. </p> <p>At the same time, patterns of mortality and morbidity are more serious in Asian, black and Irish communities than in the population as a whole, and there is much insensitivity in the NHS to the distinctive experiences, situations and requirements of these communities. </p> <p>There are two problems with the approach to asylum and immigration by both major political parties. </p> <p>First, the sense of panic the issue instils and the subjectivity with which it is discussed lead to bad law that does not work even in its own terms, giving rise to challenges both in UK courts and among international human rights bodies. </p> <p>Second, it undermines Britain's development as a community of communities. </p> <p>If Britain is to flourish, its political leaders should shape, not pander to, public opinion on issues relating to race and diversity. </p> <p>A thoroughgoing review of religion in Britain would need to reconsider a wide range of connections between the Church of England and the state; in particular, legislation widely felt to privilege Anglicans in England over other denominations and faiths. </p> <p>The Race Relations Act 1976 has had a positive effect. However, a new Equality Act is required, together with a new Equality Commission. </p> <p>Furthermore, there needs to be a Human Rights Commission to promote a human rights culture, and the United Kingdom should formally declare itself to be a multicultural society. </p> <p><b>Who's who on the commission</b></p> <p><b> Chairman</b><br> </p> <p> <b> Lord Bhikhu Parekh</b>, 65, emeritus professor of political theory at the University of Hull and deputy chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality 1985-90 </p> <p><b> Vice-chair</b><br> </p> <p> <b> Dr Kate Gavron</b>, trustee and research fellow, Institute of Community Studies, with particular interest in the Bangladeshi community in east London </p> <p><b> Commissioners</b><br> </p> <p> \u0095<b> Yasmin Alibhai-Brown</b>, writer and journalist </p> <p>\u0095<b> Muhammad Anwar</b>, research professor at the Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations, University of Warwick </p> <p>\u0095<b> Colin Bailey</b>, chief constable of Nottinghamshire, former chair of Association of Chief Police Officers' race relations sub-committee </p> <p>\u0095<b> Amina Begum</b>, social worker, London borough of Tower Hamlets </p> <p>\u0095<b> Michael Chan</b>, professor of ethnic health, University of Liverpool </p> <p>\u0095<b> Lord Navnit Dholakia</b>, 63, chair of the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders </p> <p>\u0095<b> David Faulkner</b>, senior research associate, University of Oxford centre for criminological research. </p> <p>\u0095<b> Stuart Hall</b>, 68, former professor of sociology, Open University </p> <p>\u0095<b> Bob Hepple</b> QC, Master of Clare College and professor of law, University of Cambridge </p> <p>\u0095<b> Judith Hunt</b>, chair of Camden and Islington health authority </p> <p>\u0095<b> Antony Lerman</b>, formerly executive director, Institute for Jewish Policy Research </p> <p>\u0095<b> Matthew McFarlane</b>, chief inspector, Nottinghamshire police, responsible for strategy and policy on race and community relations </p> <p>\u0095<b> Andrew Marr</b> (was a member until April 2000), now BBC political editor.

  "Unlike the Scarman and McPherson reports, which were crisis-driven and hence largely short-term in their orientation and approach, The Future of Multi-ethnic Britain is an attempt to take a calm and long-term view of the current state of our multi-ethnic nation and suggest ways of countering racial discrimination and disadvantage and making Britain a society that is at ease with its rich diversity. <p>The report concludes that although we have made considerable progress, which is greater than many other European countries and of which we can be legitimately proud, we still have a long way to go. </p> <p>Racial discrimination continues to disfigure many areas of life, and racial prejudices are easily aroused, as was seen recently in the case of the asylum seekers. Ethnic minorities do not enjoy full equality of opportunity, and valuable talents are wasted. </p> <p>Thanks to the devolution of power to Scotland and our membership of the European Union, there is an increasing tendency in certain circles to define British identity in an exclusive manner that alienates a large number of people and fails to foster a common sense of belonging. </p> <p>The report therefore makes a number of general and specific recommendations. It urges that Britain should formally declare itself a multicultural society. Such a declaration is a statement of who we think we are and tells the world and our own citizens that we accept and cherish our cultural diversity and intend to give all our citizens an equal opportunity to realise their diverse potentials and contribute to national well being. </p> <p>The report recognises that, while cherishing cultural diversity, Britain must remain a cohesive society with a shared national culture. That culture is based on shared values, including such procedural values as tolerance, mutual respect, dialogue and peaceful resolution of differences, as well as such basic ethical norms as respect for human dignity, equal worth of all and equal life chances. </p> <p>The common national culture includes shared symbols and a shared view of national identity, and these are best evolved through a democratic dialogue between our various communities. The report sees Britain both as a national community with a clear sense of collective purpose and direction and also made up of different communities interacting with each other within a shared moral framework. </p> <p>The history of a nation often has a tendency to be written in an exclusive manner, stressing some groups or traditions at the expense of others. It is therefore always a contested site and constantly rewritten. The report proposes that, in the light of our changed circumstances, we need to reconsider the traditional view of our history and open it up to new sensibilities and aspirations. </p> <p>National identity is not given once and for all and cannot be preserved as if it were an antique piece of furniture. </p> <p>The so-called white majority itself consists of groups of people divided along cultural, religious and other lines. This is equally true of the minority. Since Britain does not consist of cohesive majorities and minorities, we should think of it as a looser federation of cultures held together by common bonds of interest and affection and a collective sense of belonging. </p> <p>At a policy level the report proposes a human rights commission to help enforce the Human Rights Act. It also proposes a single equality commission to bring different gender and race based legislations within a single legal framework. </p> <p> R ace cannot be ghettoised. The report therefore recommends that all government departments should take full account of it and that we should evolve an inter-departmental co-ordinating mechanism located, perhaps, in the Cabinet Office. </p> <p>Important changes are also needed in the police service, the wider criminal justice system, political representation, education, our attitudes to asylum seekers and so on. The reports makes important recommendations in each of these areas. </p> <p>In each case its concern is three-fold: to ensure equal opportunity, to secure fair treatment and respect for differences, and to create a cohesive and self-confident country. The report rejects quotas, positive discrimination and all attempts to give any group a privileged treatment. It pleads for fairness, equality and common belonging as the necessary basis of a just, plural, rich and self-confident Britain. </p> <p>\u0095 Bhikhu Parekh is chairman of the Commission on the Future of Multi-ethnic Britain </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Twenty-six years ago, at the start of the last Labour government, ministers were handed a detailed confidential report on British race relations produced by the government's think-tank, that doubted whether the country would ever achieve a fully integrated society. For this to be achieved, it suggested, \"the internal class structure of the different coloured communities should resemble that of the white British population\". <p>It thought this might be achieved by the Indian community, but expressed grave doubts that it would be possible for manual working West Indians. Yet, as our columnist Gary Younge noted on Monday, never have so many black Britons been doing so well - or so many been doing so badly. So much for predictions. A black middle class is alive and well but so, - as a new think-tank report on the future of multi-ethnic Britain published yesterday notes - is an even bigger group suffering discrimination by the police, schools, employers and health service. </p> <p>The new report is full of sensible proposals for which this paper has long campaigned: a single human rights commission, monitoring and rooting out all forms of unlawful discrimination; an independent body to investigate complaints against the police; an end to vouchers for asylum seekers and more legal support for applicants; a greater commitment to spreading good race equality practice in education. It rightly resurrects the idea of requiring government contractors - at local and national level - to prove they are employing a fair proportion of black and Asian workers. But all these sensible ideas are likely to be swamped by its suggestion that Britain is a racially coded word that should be replaced with the term \"community of communities\". </p> <p>The commission has failed to note how the connotation of words changes. Britain was once a white imperial power. Today it is a multiracial society of different cultural, ethnic and religious backgrounds. This new diversity, which has injected a fresh vibrancy, energy and vitality into our culture, must be protected. An integrated society does not mean an assimilated society. But it does not need a further change of name. Dumping \"Great Britain\" was right; dropping Britain would be wrong. America was once a wasp (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) dominated society. No one assumes that any more. Britain is travelling down a similar road.</p>",
  "<p>Charles Clarke, Home Office minister </p> <p>We know that some children, particularly gathered in large groups, can become involved in anti-social behaviour and crime. Early intervention can be more effective than waiting until a child ends up in the criminal justice system. After consultations, we are extending the age-range to encourage local authorities to use these powers to tackle effectively the problem of children causing nuisance to residents and indulging in anti-social behaviour. But we are also spending \u00a320m on schemes to help stop children becoming involved in crime. <br><strong>Verdict: Yes</strong></p> <p><strong> Paul Cavadino</strong>, spokesman for Nacro, the crime reduction charity </p> <p>Blanket curfews to cover whole areas aren't a good way to tackle crime. To start with, they stop the law-abiding majority of young people from going about normal activities, such as sports, youth clubs and visiting friends. They also make life difficult for parents, especially if a curfew is lifted for youngsters out with adults, who would then face huge demands on their time. Second, there is no evidence that it works: a study in California at a time when youth crime was falling showed that it fell no more in countries where there was a curfew than where there wasn't.<br> <strong>Verdict: No</strong></p> <p><strong> Reyhan Karnas</strong>, reporter on Exposure, a young people's magazine</p> <p>A lot of the young people I know who have been in trouble with the police don't have parents around in the evenings anyway. Their parents are out a lot, or they're working. So how would they be able to keep them in? What anyone who really wants to cut youth crime should do is improve facilities for young people: the problem is that there aren't enough safe, legal things for us to do in the evenings. Give us more youth clubs, more ice rinks, more places to go. Wouldn't that make life better for everyone - instead of measures to keep us locked up all night?<br><strong> Verdict: No</strong></p> <p><strong> Paul Flynn</strong>, Labour MP for Newport West </p> <p>Like all parents, Jack is great on theory, but less so on how to put it into practice. The idea that parents can tell teenagers what to do is a delusion that has affected parents for generations. It happens to all of us: we forget what it was like to be young. That's the trouble with this policy. It just doesn't sound practical. How would we enforce it? How many more police are going to have to be out there to make sure young people are all tucked up in bed at night? So many politicians are deluded by the belief that applause can only come from tough policies.<br><strong> Verdict: No</strong></p> <p><strong> Tracey Golledge</strong>, council estate resident, mother of a 14 -year-old </p> <p>I can see why he wants to do it, and in many ways I think it would be a good idea. My own estate isn't too bad, but the neighbouring estate has lots of kids on it who are out at night causing trouble. The trouble is that I don't think Jack Straw's idea would work in practice. If you're a mum with younger children, you've got no chance when a strapping 15-year-old says at 10pm: \"I'm going out, what are you going to do about it?\" To say you'll fine that mother \u00a31,000 isn't on - and if you end up sending her to prison and put her children into care, what have you achieved?<br> Verdict: No</p>",
  "<p>Home secretaries can be tarnished by failings in some outpost of the department's wide-ranging responsibilities. After fiascos with passports and asylum seekers, Jack Straw's prison policy is in danger of continuing that pattern. </p> <p>Like his Conservative predecessor, he has shown little desire to follow the approach of earlier home secretaries with policies based on reducing the size of the prison population. Instead, numbers have grown remorselessly. With mandatory sentence lengths for severe crimes, to sate the public appetite for severe punishment, Straw clearly believes that \"prison works\". The result: large numbers of lifers, with scant hope of early release, could increase violence and disruption in already overcrowded prisons. </p> <p>Drug dealers are one target group for mandatory sentences. The danger in demonising any group is of missing shades of grey. Just as most homicides are committed by close relatives, so the majority of those sentenced for supply of drugs are small-time dealers using the money to support their habit. This is light years from the barons of the drug world, living off crime in luxury mansions. Yet the former, not the latter, will be caught by the application of \"three strikes and you're out\" to the criminal justice system. </p> <p>In the first comprehensive spending review, the criminal justice system secured substantial extra resources for drug treatment programmes and testing orders. These orders are being introduced nationally despite ambiguous evidence of effectiveness as seen in three pilot areas. They risk being an over-hyped but ineffective remedy, like child curfew orders and anti-social behaviour orders. By contrast, additional resources for treatment services in the community are minimal. The result is a logjam of prisoners, wanting such treatment, for whom no services are available. </p> <p>The Home Office reigns supreme in Whitehall turf wars on drug policy. Its prevention advisory service has extended its role into both drug education and treatment programmes, ruffling feathers in the education and health ministries. Yet the same department treats the idea of a rational debate about decriminalisation of cannabis use as if it were heresy. Such a debate might well conclude that the public health risks would outweigh the benefits, but current attitudes exclude any discussion. </p> <p>Good government is not responding to every populist campaign of the Sun or Daily Mail. It is about managing effectively for results. Focus groups are no way to get clear policy outcomes. </p>",
  "<p>Hopes of a small but significant government rethink on long-term care funding have been raised by a decision by the Scottish executive to go its own way on the issue. In its response to the royal commission on long-term care, it has followed England in rejecting the commission's recommendation that \"personal\" care should be free. But in opting similarly for the lesser benefit of free nursing care in all settings, it has also rejected English ministers' approach to defining such care. </p> <p>South of the border, ministers are proposing that the NHS pay for all care defined as \"the costs of registered nurse time spent on providing, delegating or supervising care in any setting\". Critics say this approach is likely to exclude much care delivered by health care assistants and to discriminate against elderly people with conditions such as dementia. </p> <p>The Scottish executive has said: \"We recognise that some conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, mean that people require a high level of care, if not specific medical intervention. We do not therefore believe that either the rigid definition of tasks, or the professional demarcation of nursing, offers a positive way forward. We believe that care must be provided on the basis of need, rather than on definitions of what is done or who does it.\" </p> <p>John Hutton, English social care minister, has said that the door remains open to representations on implementation of free nursing care, intended for a year's time. Campaigners now sense a chance to force movement. </p> <p>Michelle Dixon, head of public affairs at the Royal College of Nursing, says: \"If Scotland can accept the benefits of a broad definition of the nursing care they will provide free under the NHS, there is certainly no justification for a narrower definition in England.\"</p>",
  "<p> Six-to-four the field, six-to-one bar! Shouting the odds, the TV and my father, low down on the living room floor. </p> <p> C'mon, baby! he yells, beating his flank with his fist. With the betting slip in his teeth, he gallops down the last furlong of the rug, to the home straight of the lino. Words bolt from the side of his mouth: Yankee Piggott Photo-finish. I don't understand any of it: I think my father's English leaves a lot to be desired. </p> <p> He curses: Jesus Christ. </p> <p> At the end of the race, his face is very flushed, an inch from the set. He's watching the lines and dots as if Barney's Boy will suddenly leap through the screen. Ripping pink shreds of paper from his mouth, my father tears up his slip and spits the remains on the rug. Then he starts in on the Sporting Life, holding it out in front of him, rending it between his fists until he's tearing air. I know at these moments that he would tear me too, for the slightest thing, and I crawl ever so slowly behind the couch, until he's put on his donkey jacket and slammed the back door. </p> <p> He isn't just like this about horses. My father will gamble on anything that moves. He won't do Bingo or fruit machines or snow on Christmas Day, but horses and pontoon and poker and dogs. My father's love is Chance. Look at that roulette wheel! Bet red, bet black, bet red, bet black. If he could place his bet Under Starter's Orders he would still change his mind over every fence. The Form makes no difference, the words don't make sense, and the odds at Joe Coral have no bearing on his stake. </p> <p> He has always been this way, according to my mother. She made her own bet on him, in November 1948, in the church of St Mark's, in a white lace gown. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> This is what happens just before I am born: it's 1960. My parents, Frankie and Mary, have five beautiful daughters, and a half-share in a cafe overlooking Cardiff docks. Salvatore Capanone, my father's oldest friend, owns the other half. The sailors on shore leave pour in through the red door to eat, and find a girl. My family lives above the cafe. They have two rooms; one long one, divided into bedroom and lounge by a thick toile curtain depicting scenes of the French aristocracy, and an airless back room which they call The Pit, because you have to climb down into it. My sisters inhabit The Pit, and my father has put a gate up in the doorway to stop Luca, who's only two years old, from climbing up the steps and falling down again. Luca swings her fat leg over the gate whenever my mother isn't looking, and falls from that instead. </p> <p> There is a third room, one more flight up. It has a square wooden table covered with worn green felt, and four vinyl-backed chairs stacked one upon the other. In the far corner is a window where a blind conceals the day. My mother never goes into this room; it's not hers to use. </p> <p> There is no kitchen. Every morning my mother trudges downstairs to the cafe to fetch food for my sisters to eat, which they do, sitting in a long line on the couch and watching the Test Card on the television in the corner, while she moves her washing from surface to surface, doing her impression of someone who is tidy. My father's old sea chest is the only storage space, filled with baby clothes. I'll be wearing them soon. My mother knows this, but she doesn't want to air the clothes because my father doesn't. Also, she's determined that I'm a boy this time, and so a lot of the shawls and bonnets and little woollen coats will be redundant, being mainly pink. </p> <p> Celesta, who's eleven going on forty, is helping to get Marina and Rose ready for school. They look like two turnips in their cream-coloured balaclava hats, and Celesta doesn't want to be seen with them. She wears a straw boater with a chocolate-brown ribbon, bought for when she goes to Our Lady's Convent School. She won't start there until next term, by which time the boater will have a distinctly weathered look, but at the moment she wears it all the time, even in bed. Fran has just begun at primary school. She draws angry pictures of bonfires using three crayons at a time. My mother pays no attention to this, having to deal with Luca now, and the prospect of me later. </p> <p> When the other children leave, my mother squashes Luca into her hip and goes downstairs to the cafe. She unbolts the front door, slipping off the heavy chain which swings against the wood, and paces the narrow aisle between the tables. At the furthest end, where the daylight doesn't stretch, are two booths and a long counter. Close to its brass lip sit a single smeared tumbler and a half-empty bottle of Advocaat. The air is sweetish here. A sleeveless Peggy Lee is propped against the gramophone in the corner - Salvatore has had a late night. </p> <p> My mother eases Luca into her high chair, and as soon as she is down, with the rush of cold around her thigh, she screams. She won't stop until she has something sticky on bread, or until my father comes back from the market and swings her in his arms. Luca can't understand why she isn't allowed to practise running. Salvatore used to let her, when my mother had to go and fetch Fran, or hunt the Bookies for my father. </p> <p> Frankie and Salvatore are a strange brace. My father is smooth and lean, well cut in his well-cut suit. His partner is softer, larger, with milky hands and brimming eyes. Every morning Salvatore puts a clean white handkerchief in the pocket of his apron to deal with the tears which will flow through the day. He blames the heat of the kitchen, rather than his childless wife or the plaintive tones of Mario Lanza. The air is full of music when Salvatore cooks. He plays Dino and Sammy, endless Sinatra, and his favourite, Louis Prima, who reminds him of somewhere not quite like home. The records are stacked in the plate rack on top of the counter, the plates haphazardly stowed beneath. Salvatore glides through the days and nights, dusting flour into the grooves of Julie London, wiping her clean with his napkin. And then he wipes his eyes. </p> <p> There is a delicate division of labour in this business. Salvatore is a better cook than Frankie, for whom the flames of the kitchen are too much like his vision of Hell. So while Salvatore cuts his fingers, brands the soft flesh of his forearm on the searing stove, and sings and cries, Frankie wears his suit and does things with money upstairs. But Salvatore likes it this way, he gets to see people. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> At first, convinced that it would tempt the passers-by, Salvatore made stews and bread and almond cakes dusted with sugar. He wedged the red door open with a bar stool, wafting the smell of baking out into the street with his tea-towel. He wrote a sign, DELICIOUS FOOD, in a careful hand, and tied it with parcel string around the rusted frame of the awning outside. But Mack the Knife spilt out on to the pavement, upsetting the barber shop owner next door, the sign ran in the rain, and soon Salvatore brought the stool back to the bar. The pigeons in the yard grew fat on unbought food. </p> <p> Never mind, said my mother. It takes time. </p> <p> Now he cooks for the sailors, who want egg and chips or bacon in starchy white rolls, and the cafe is busy. Sailors bring in girls, and girls attract trade. Salvatore fries everything in the flat black pan on the, stove, his thinning hair stuck to his head with steam. The combed strands come unglued throughout the day, falling one by one in lank array over his left ear. He pretends to be a widower so that the night girls will pity him. In fact he is married to Carlotta, who is respectable, and will not enter The Port of Call, our cafe. Or as Carlotta calls it in her broken English, That Den-o-Sin. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> Salvatore loves my mother and my father and my sisters. He is part of the family. And he will love me too, when I am born. Until then, he has to make do with Luca, who shrieks from her high chair the moment my mother's back is turned. Salvatore watches from a safe distance as Luca's arms jolt up and down in an urgent plea to be lifted. He would free her, but he daren't. The last time he did, she ran like a river to the end of the cafe and caught her head on the edge of a table. She stared at it, astonished, while her forehead bulged and split. The knock held her silent for two days, so silent, my mother thought she was damaged: it was the only time Luca was quiet. </p> <p> Now when my mother has to go out, she traps Luca in The Pit with soft toys to keep her happy for the five minutes she thinks she will be away. Luca throws them at the furthest wall, screaming like a bomb. </p> <p> In search of my father, my mother is blunt and shaming. She no longer has the time to be discreet. </p> <p> Have you seen Frankie? Len the Bookie? In The Bute, are they? Righto. She tracks down her husband, to the arcade, the coffee house, the back room of the pub. When she finds him, she is vocal. My father complains. </p> <p> This is business, Mary. Keep out of it. The other men look down and grin into their shirts. And when my father does return, my mother points to Luca's head. </p> <p> That's down to you, that is. Sufficiently shamed, or just tired of losing, Frankie starts a clean sheet. He stops betting; he has finished with it for good. But when my mother tells him about me (at six months the evidence is mounting), he takes the money he's accumulated through not gambling and opens a card school in the top room of the cafe. He wins, and wins. And suddenly I am luck personified. </p> <p> We'll call him Fortuno, he says, rubbing my mother's stomach as if she's harbouring the Golden Egg. My mother has other ideas. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> In the top room, all four chairs are occupied. There is a haze of cheroots, a sweat of onions, the stink of eggs in oil. My father has staked everything on the winning of the game. Away in the infirmary, I'm wailing at the midwife as Frankie decides to Twist. My mother is straining with the labour of prayer. Over and over. </p> <p> Oh God, let it be a boy. </p> <p> When the midwife pulls me out, she conceals me. I am shunted from scales to blanket to anteroom. She closes the door on my mother. </p> <p> If you have to tell her anything, tell her it's a boy, says the midwife to the nurse. </p> <p> Salvatore's wife Carlotta, waiting in the corridor with her big black handbag poised on the bulge of her stomach, catches just this one phrase - tell her it's a boy - and makes a phone-call to the cafe. </p> <p> Salvatore is watching the card game from the doorway upstairs, peeping through the curtain of beads which hangs from the lintel. They cascade from his shoulders like Madonna tears. He doesn't hear the telephone; his mind is in anguish for the game he's not allowed to play. His eyes are fixed on the Brylcreem glint which crowns my father's head. Salvatore's right hand rests stiff across his heart, his left holds a spatula, which oozes slow drips on to the red linoleum floor. He should be downstairs making greasy meals for the thin night girls, but Salvatore cannot concentrate on bacon and eggs when his business is at stake. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> Salvatore likes his partner Frankie, even though he's lazy and not always dependable, and he adores the night girls downstairs. The young ones perch on the stools, their bouffant heads nodding in time to the music on the gramophone; they are stiff-lacquered, clean-scented. The older ones smile, now and then flinging an arm across the booths to display their latest Solitaires. Or they sit in silence. They draw their wet fingers round the rim of their glasses, in an effort to make the last rum last. </p> <p> Rita, Sophia, Gina. Salvatore recites the girls' names in his sing-song voice. These women are really Irene and Lizzie and Pat. They close around the green metal ashtrays, depressing the buttons with their jewelled hands, watching the debris swirl into the hidden bowl below. When they do leave, the imprints of their bored thighs remain a while upon the shiny leatherette. They never say thank you and they never look back. Salvatore always forgives them. He wipes his hands down the breast of his apron, and sings through the night, while Frankie gambles in the room above his head. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> Tonight, Salvatore wants to watch. Here we have my father, the giant Martineau, Ilya the Pole, and crooked Joe Medora. This pack of men is busy. </p> <p> Sal ... telephone, says Joe, not looking up. Salvatore rolls reluctantly downstairs. </p> <p> Joe Medora wears a slouch hat, a silk scarf anchored at the neck, a Savile Row suit. He's an archetypal villain who makes sure he looks the part. He angles his cigar into the side of his lipless mouth, staring over his Hand. He's seen all the films; no gesture is wasted. He is patient. </p> <p> It's my father's move. Jack of Hearts, Five of Clubs, Four - winking - Diamonds. </p> <p> It's a boy! cries Salvatore, beating back upstairs. Bambino, Frankie! </p> <p> And my father, who is Frankie Bambina to his friends, poor unlucky Frank to have so many daughters, Twists in reckless joy, and loses the cafe, the shoebox under the floorboards full with big money, his own father's ruby ring, and my mother's white lace gown, to Joe Medora. </p> <p> At least I have a son, he thinks, as he rolls the ring across the worn green felt. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> My father stands above my cot with a clenched fist and a stiff smile. He rubs his left hand along the lining of his pocket, feeling the absence of his father's ring and the nakedness of losing. </p> <p> At the end of the ward, Salvatore's face appears in the porthole of the swing door. Carlotta's face fills the other, and for a moment they stare separately at the rows and rows of beds and cots. Carlotta lets out a shout, Mary! Frankie!, and sweeps towards my parents. Salvatore raises his hand in salute, but takes his time, pausing to exchange greetings with the other mothers. </p> <p> A fine baby, Missus! </p> <p> What a beauty! Boy or girl? </p> <p> Twins? How lucky! There aren't enough babies in the ward for Salvatore, perhaps not in the world. He bends over each one with his big smile and his hands clasped at his back. </p> <p> Carlotta spreads herself on the chair next to my mother's bed and rummages deep into her bag. She makes small talk, not trusting herself to mention me, or the cafe, or the future. My father stabs his teeth with a broken matchstick he's found in the other pocket of his trousers, and sucks air, and says nothing. No one looks at me. Then Salvatore approaches the foot of my mother's bed and opens his arms wide to embrace my father. Both men lean into each other, quietly choking. Carlotta produces a dented red box from her bag, prises off the lid, and offers my mother a chocolate. </p> <p> Please have one, Mary. They're your favourites. </p> <p> Mary is in a state of mute blankness. A girl baby, yet again. In her head, she wonders what to call me - she's exhausted her list of Saints' names on the boys she never bore, and is sick of all the arias in the names her girls have got. Dolores drifts up in miserable smoke. </p> <p> Salvatore rests a hand upon my mother's arm and gazes into my cot. The pink matinee jacket is fastened too tight around my neck; it reeks of mothballs. Wearing his best suit for the visit (which is also the one he wears to funerals), Salvatore smells the same as me. He lands great kisses on my forehead and holds me up for inspection, cajoling my mother. </p> <p> See, Mary! So pretty! </p> <p> My mother fixes on the flaking paint of the radiator, and wishes we would all go away. Frankie, too, has had enough of Cooing and Aahing. He puts his hand on Salvatore's chest and shunts him back down the ward. He presses so hard, Salvatore feels the buttons of his shirt indent his skin. </p> <p> Mary is in shock, my father tells them. Better leave her alone. This is nothing compared to the shock she'll get when she finds out she's homeless, and her wedding dress adorns a bottle-blonde from Llanelli. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p>I am a week old when everything changes. My parents move into a run-down house at one end of a winding street. The other end is dead, sealed by a high wall spun with barbed wire. Joe Medora owns our new house, and our old cafe. The rent increases on a whim: when Joe gambles on a loser, it goes up. But it can go up when he bets on a winner, too. </p> <p> My father is put in the Box Room: it is a cell. Celesta and Marina and Rose have the back bedroom. One window overlooks the road, where Rose leans out to spit on unsuspecting heads. Marina springs up and down on her bed, tearing off the wallpaper in long strips, while Celesta puts her fingers in her ears, reads The Book of Common Ailments, and convinces herself that she is dying. </p> <p> The front bedroom becomes Our Room, my mother and Fran and Luca and me. Fran has the bed in the corner, and Luca has exclusive rights over my mother, who puts me in the chest. When she's convinced that I'll survive the night, I'm allowed to share the bed. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> Carlotta is recruited in these difficult times, apparently to look after us children. She's really here to make sure my mother is a Good Wife who doesn't desert her fallen-on-hard-times husband: my mother might at any second run away with, say, the Coalman. This is prescient, but not in the way Carlotta thinks. </p> <p> For now, Salvatore still works at the cafe, renamed The Moonlight Club in sputtering neon, and he leaves his friend Frankie alone. But he thinks about us, he worries about me, and he asks Carlotta every night for a report. </p> <p> Getting big now, Carlotta says, stretching her arms out like a fisherman to show how I'm growing. </p> <p> Salvatore is not entirely convinced, and once a week he sends Carlotta with a parcel of food, stolen from his shifts at The Moonlight. He feels he is entitled; after all, he's still a partner in the business. Except these days, working with Joe Medora, he feels more like a slave. </p> <p> While my mother takes to her bed and stares at the ceiling, Carlotta cooks up a steam in the little kitchen. She makes baked pasta with blackened edges, solid slabs of home-made bread. Everything she provides is sharp and hard, as if to counteract the softness of her body and the thick roll of her voice. My mother thinks of little, but she listens. She hears the sticky cough of the woman in her kitchen, and imagines Carlotta dipping her feelers in the cooking pot, testing the saltiness of the ham. </p> <p> It is about this time that I am burnt. </p>",
  "A picture of a set of tightly gritted teeth ought to have accompanied today's reports that Gordon Brown is planning to hand some sort of sop to rural motorists and the haulage industry. The chancellor may see the political necessity of staving off petrol protestors, whose 60-day deadline for government action expires on 13 November, but you can be sure that he's not happy about taking a dent in his iron reputation. <p>That's why his plan, which is said to involve cutting the road tax paid by some motorists in the most distant, rural parts of the country from \u00a3155 to \u00a345, is so insignificant. Affecting virtually no one, it will appease just as few motorists - and many of those who may benefit will not need the aid, anyway. The plan may well mean cheaper motoring for the Queen at Balmoral and the Duke of Westminster on his highland estate, but for the rest of us it might as well not exist.</p> <p>As a result, motoring organisations, who represent rather more suburban Mondeo drivers than green-wellied Land Rover owners, have attacked the plan even before it has been properly announced. Motoring lobby groups such as the AA want cheaper petrol for all, achieved either by lowering the world price of oil (which is beyond even New Labour's powers) or by cutting tax to levels found elsewhere in Europe. Even the Tories' promise of a 3p cut is hardly enough to sate them. </p> <p>There is no way that the present chancellor is going to grant even that. Whether he is persuaded by the environmental case for high levels of energy taxation is open to doubt. What is certain, though, is that he enjoys seeing the government's coffers fill with the motorists' gold, and enjoys his unbending reputation even more. </p> <p>But though Gordon Brown is part fiscal-strongman, he is also part politician, a would-be prime minister in a government that wants a second term above almost anything else. When New Labour loses seats next May, the chancellor will take some of the blame; and perhaps most of it if his refusal to deal with the cost of motoring becomes a big election issue. </p> <p>As a result he has shifted from his position last month, which was to dismiss all talk of changing motoring taxes as political blackmail, downplaying even the vague promise of doing something in his autumn statement. His new plan to help rural drivers may be only the start, a way of breaking the political ice and introducing the idea that he will act. The oldest political trick in the book is to lead everyone to think you are going to do very little and then suddenly do quite a lot. </p> <p>The chancellor may be playing this game. His \"secret\" meeting with representatives of the haulage industry last Friday, also uncovered today, may be part of it. </p> <p>So may be suggestions that the prime minister has \"told\" the chancellor to do something about the problem. These may make Tony Blair look like a leader, but they also make him part of the cave-in if one comes about. \"It wasn't my fault, mate. The other guy made me swerve,\" is a standard line to give the police after a car crash.</p> <p>Gordon Brown may be about to employ it to get out of the government's recent political calamity, too.</p>",
  "Israeli newspapers declared a state of civil war yesterday, hours after mosques and Arab businesses in Tel Aviv were besieged by Jewish mobs in a night of mayhem. <p>The attacks in the city were the worst explosion of sectarian hatred since the Jewish state was created 52 years ago. </p> <p>\"Today you have a chasm that will take years to bridge. The last years we had succeeded - a great part of society - in finding a formula for Jews and Arabs to live together,\" said Joseph Algazy, a veteran commentator on the Israeli Arab community for the liberal Ha'aretz newspaper. \"Now this is destroyed. The poison seed has been planted, and it will not be easy to root it out, or to forget.\" </p> <p>On the beachfront in the southern suburb of Bat Yam, a young man named after an Israeli war hero slouched on a car outside the smashed shutters and glass display-cases of the Victoria ice-cream parlour, savouring his handiwork of the night before. </p> <p>\"We are not going to sit quiet anymore. The government does not do anything to stop the Arabs, so we have to take the law into our own hands,\" said Moshe Dayan, 22. </p> <p>His friend, Meir Moyal, who was also present when a mob of hundreds of Jews destroyed the Arab-owned business with their bare hands, said: \"This is a Jewish area, and there should only be Jews here.\" </p> <p>Until Monday night, however, that would never have occurred to Simon Sasin, the owner of the shop. Although ethnically a Palestinian, he says he speaks Hebrew better now than his mother tongue, Arabic. \"I know it's nothing personal,\" he said. \"It's just Arab against Jew.\" </p> <p>Increasingly, that is the way it is beginning to appear in much of Israel, as ugly attacks on Israeli Arabs spread across the country. </p> <p>The unravelling of Israel's delicate social fabric began last week when Arab Israelis in northern Galilee began to protest in solidarity with their Palestinian cousins in the West Bank and Gaza. </p> <p>That display of anger was in itself enough to send pulses racing in many parts of Israel. But the destruction of a Jewish pilgrimage site in Nablus by Palestinian mobs at the weekend sent those passions spinning out of control. </p> <p>On two consecutive nights this week, Jewish mobs attacked the 200-year-old Hassan Bek mosque in central Tel Aviv. They destroyed the storeroom with a petrol bomb before returning after evening prayers on Monday. \"They stood at the gates and started screaming: 'Death to Arabs' and throwing stones,\" said Nuwar Daka, the imam. </p> <p>The police arrived promptly and pushed the mob back, but the Arab community is still fearful. Several Arab men stand on the mosque's front steps; they say they will spend their nights here. Several people said they were afraid to turn up to work for their Jewish employers. </p> <p>\"Everybody is afraid - Jew and Arab. We don't know what is going on, and how we arrived at this. Who knows? Maybe we are going to start shooting at each other,\" said Yakub Yusuf, an accountant.</p>",
  "<p>An air and land search was under way in North Yorkshire last night after two teenage girls were swept into a river during a school trip. </p> <p>Cave rescue teams and RAF helicopters led the search after the two, both 14, fell into Stainforth Beck, near Settle, at around 3.30pm. </p> <p>A search near a waterfall where the beck joins the river Ribble failed to find the girls, and rescue teams concentrated their search on the river during the afternoon. </p> <p>Acting inspector Stuart Mackleston of North Yorkshire police confirmed that the two had been \"river walking\" with 13 other pupils and two teachers from the Royds school in Oulton, West Yorkshire. </p> <p>They were all walking up stream in the beck when one of the girls got her foot stuck between stones, and lost her balance when her boot came off. </p> <p>Mr Mackleston said: \"A teacher tried to steady her, as did another student, but the girl fell over, dragging the other student with her. Both were swept away.\" </p> <p>The missing girls' parents were being kept informed, he said. </p> <p>Police helicopters with heat seeking equipment made a sweep of the area at 6pm last night, with no success. Although forces from across the county border in Lancashire had lent equipment and support, police said nightfall and heavy rain made it hard to continue. </p> <p>A police spokesman said: \"We have searched the beck and the Ribble as far as Settle, and helicopter have searched this far and well on into Lancashire.\" </p> <p>He said a further search would be made later in the evening when the river level had dropped. </p> <p>The beck, usually about 10 metres across and two metres deep, had been swollen throughout the day by rainwater from overnight storms. </p> <p>It lies at the western edge of the Yorkshire Dales in the shadow of Pen-y-ghent and close to the Settle and Carlisle railway line. </p> <p>The area is popular with walkers, cavers and school parties, but rivers in a land scape famous for its limestone rocks can turn from streams to torrents after the kind of continuous rain which has fallen for the past three days. </p> <p>Police said the group of 15 boys and girls had been out river walking as part of a week long school trip to the Yorkshire Dales. </p> <p>A boy had also fallen into the beck but had been rescued by a teacher. </p> <p>As weather conditions deteriorated and night began to close in, residents from the village of Stainforth joined in the search for the two girls. </p> <p>When asked whether there was any hope of finding the them alive in the river, a spokesman from North York shire police said: \"Miracles do happen.\" </p> <p>A shop assistant working in Settle, 10 miles south of the search area, said that when he heard about the search, \"I phoned home immediately to check whether my little brother and sister were OK, but customers are telling me they [the missing teenagers] were on a school trip from Leeds.\" </p> <p>Roger Whittaker, spokesman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said rivers were at their most dangerous at this time of year as heavy rainfall combined with cold temperatures. </p> <p>Mr Whittaker emphasised that the only safe place to swim was a properly supervised pool or beach. </p> <p>Recent figures had shown that more and more children and young teenagers were drowning in rivers and streams across the UK. </p> <p>More than 54 children aged under 15 drowned in rivers last year, he said, compared with 36 in 1998.</p>",
  "\u0095 Alexander Walker objects to your description of Leni Riefenstahl as a \"Nazi filmmaker\" as being inaccurate (Letters, October 9). However, Goebbels structured all communications and cultural life through \"guilds\" which excluded Jews, communists and other undesirables, but which totally controlled work. Riefenstahl was, of course, a member. He then actively discouraged people like her from joining the party in order to fool the public about their independence. <p>Contrary to Walker's claims, Riefenstahl's relationship with the Nazi leadership was deep and abiding and antedated their coming to power. It included invoking the aid of the notorious anti-semite and Gauleiter of Nuremberg, Julius Streicher, to silence Bela Balacz, the Jewish direc tor of Riefenstahl's biggest hit as an actress, the 1932 film The Blue Light. Walker is however correct when he states that Goebbels disliked her. There was good reason for this. She got in the way of his propaganda plans and had, dangerously, direct access to Hitler. Her persuasiveness was legendary and certainly bamboozled US de-Nazifiers. </p> <p>And in 1941, for her film Tiefland, she took 60 Romanies out of a small holding concentration camp, the Maxglan Lager near Salzburg, to use as extras. She returned these families to the camp system where most died. The survivors were filmed by Nina Gladitz for her 1987 documentary Time of Darkness and Silence, which is a potent rebuttal of Riefenstahl's endlessly hawked protestations of innocence and ignorance. </p> <p>\"Nazi filmmaker\" seems like a pretty accurate description. </p> <p><b>Prof Brian Winston </b><br> University of Westminster <br><a href=\"mailto:winstob@wmin.ac.uk\">winstob@wmin.ac.uk</a> </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095No matter how great a contribution to cinematography we believe Leni Riefenstahl to have made (and to me she is one of the greatest directors ever to have lived), to this day she is totally unable to understand why one cannot divorce art from politics striving to promote the Aryan superhuman while professing ignorance and shock at the inevitable and tragic outcome of the movement built upon this fascist aesthetic. </p> <p>Riefenstahl's socialising with the Nazi leadership in the 1930s is documented in Goebbels's diaries and elsewhere. She adored \"our Fuhrer\" from their first meet ing in 1932 to her visit to the Berghof in 1944, agreed with Hitler's policies as expressed in Mein Kampf and wrote in 1939 of her \"indescribable joy\" as Nazi troops marched down the Champs Elysees. And, to correct Alexander Walker, Riefenstahl was exhonerated of party membership but was found guilty of complicity as a sympathiser at the Freibourg de-Nazification trials. </p> <p>This twisted genius taught many of us a great deal about cinematography and taught the BBC outside broadcast unit almost everything it knows. But, as the son of a Jewish refugee, I was troubled enough buying Riefenstahl's films, without having to stomach a whitewashing of this 98-year-old apologist for the 1,000-Year Reich. </p> <p><b>Mike Green</b><br> London</p>"
