  "<p>I have just one certificate stuck to the cork board above my desk, but what I did to get it is something I'm particularly proud of, and also a little embarrassed about. It certifies that I successfully completed a flight aboard a British Airways aircraft - there is even a photograph of the very plane, a Boeing 757, way above the white cliffs of Dover. When I look at this picture, I often wonder how I got through this flight. Perhaps I should have made a lunge for the emergency exit and bailed out. Or kicked and screamed until the pilot turned back. You see, I did once get off an aircraft shortly before it taxied to the runway. That was a couple of years before I undertook the fear-of-flying course; a couple of years during which I steadily lost touch with reality. </p> <p>Fear of flying is totally irrational, or so I've been told countless times, but when you experience it, it seems the most logical thing in the world. And it can take your breath away, literally, because it's not just a mental condition; it has powerful physical symptoms, too. What might at first seem to be a dull ache in your stomach quickly spreads throughout your body, so you hurt all over. Meanwhile, your heart rate begins to shoot up, along with your blood pressure, and you start to sweat profusely. You become nauseous. And everything appears to close in around you. You feel as if you are about to implode. You don't exactly feel rigid with fear, more you just feel totally crushed by it. </p> <p>The symptoms first manifested themselves on a Swissair Airbus that was about to depart Geneva for London Heathrow. They were so bad that neither the cabin crew, or even my uncle with whom I was travelling, could have persuaded me to stay on board. </p> <p>Perspiring and shaking wildly, I finally stood up, grabbed my hand luggage, muttered something to my uncle about taking the train, and stumbled for the exit. I didn't look back. I was allowed to get off because the plane had been delayed for more than an hour-and-a-half due to a \"technical problem\", and a few other businessmen sitting in the front of the plane were also getting off, though clearly for very different reasons. </p> <p>Had there not been a \"technical problem\", I'm pretty sure I would have completed this flight, albeit very nervously. As it was, the longer we sat on the Tarmac, with men in overalls wandering on board every so often, the more anxious I became. In fact, at one point the plane actually pushed back from the stand and was heading for the runway, engines roaring, or, rather, sort of whining, only to return a number of minutes later. The pilot eventually explained that a computer would have to be changed, although this was a pretty quick operation and we would be off shortly. I, however, couldn't help thinking that it would be a lot easier to get off - after a while, I couldn't bare to look at what was going on (in retrospect, I think this was because I didn't want to witness an engineer making a mistake, not that I would have known what that would have looked like). With each new setback, I was more convinced that this plane was never going to make it to London and that it was going to crash, that we were all going to die, gruesomely - my anxiety and the corresponding physical symptoms spiralling ever more out of control. </p> <p>The source of my phobia was a Swissair Airbus (for all I know, it might have been the very same) leaving Geneva for London almost one year earlier. Everything was going smoothly that day. There were no delays, the evening sky appeared clear - a beautiful, deep mauve colour with a few snowy peaks just visible. Travelling for work, I happened to be sitting in the business section and was more concerned with the newspaper I had been handed than anything that was going on around me. We took off right on schedule - that I remember, as I was eager to get back in time for dinner with my fianc\u00e9e. A few seconds later, just as we were at what seemed to be the steepest (and slowest) point of the climb, there was a huge bang, an explosive bang. An electric-blue flash shot through the cabin, along the side walls and aisle, the overhead lockers and right under my feet. A number of people screamed, though not at the front of the plane, not in business class. Then there was this eerie silence. No one even rustled their paper as we waited for the plane to start tumbling back to earth. </p> <p>My first thought was, wow, I'm going to die in a plane crash. Me. Why me? And why now? I had just got engaged. I had recently sold my first novel. I had a terrific new job. For about the first time in my life everything was going right. Then wham. But instead of plunging to earth, the plane kept on climbing. Up in the plush business section, we started to look at one another quizzically. After what seemed like for ever, but what must have been four or five minutes, the pilot came on the PA to say that the plane had been hit by lightning but there was nothing to worry about. They had run a number of checks and we were to continue to London Heathrow, where we were still expected to land on time. </p> <p>Over the next year I flew a great deal - I had little option. My \"terrific\" new job was in fact travel editor of an international newspaper. Refusing to accept that I had suddenly become afraid of flying - I never talked about the lightning strike - I found myself drinking more and more heavily before I got on a plane. And then I started making up all sorts of excuses to get out of going on trips, particularly those involving developing countries or eastern European airlines, or airlines that used Airbuses. I'd ring ahead to check. Looking back, I see that I turned down Brazil, Mexico, Morocco twice, Budapest and Prague. </p> <p>As well as the alcohol, I also began consuming handfuls of beta-blockers that my doctor had prescribed for me. Beta-blockers are meant to help reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety, and with those out of the way, without your heart pumping like mad, it's supposedly easier to think about something other than your anxiety - though I think that I found the drink more effective. When I went to New York on Concorde, I consumed so much Dom P\u00e9rignon 1985 Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon that we could have left the stratosphere completely and zoomed off into space for all I would have known. Then I tried to go everywhere on Eurostar, and despite on one occasion being stuck in the tunnel for four hours (three of which were in darkness), I still vastly preferred the experience to flying. It simply didn't set my mind racing with so many catastrophic thoughts. </p> <p>Yet why I let myself in for another Geneva hop, on Swissair, almost exactly a year after I thought I was going to be in a fatal crash, I still can't quite explain - perhaps I was testing myself. However, once on the Tarmac, in this Airbus that obviously had a serious technical problem, I knew I wouldn't be so lucky a second time - I had already been warned. My fate was sealed. Suddenly flying didn't just frighten me; I had developed a phobia about it. All rationality had gone out of the window. Why would Swissair, an airline with one of the best safety records in the world, allow a dodgy plane to take off? </p> <p>Of course, I knew that nothing would happen to the plane - I left my uncle on it, after all - just as I knew flying was one of the safest forms of travel. Still, I was glad I got off that plane. I remember walking through the terminal building, heading for the train, feeling a huge weight had lifted. I suppose in succumbing to my anxiety, my phobia, I at least recognised that I had a problem. </p> <p>For a while I let things get really out of hand. I read everything I could find about planes and their safety records. Regardless of the statistics, I would always come to the conclusion that none of them was that safe. There was always a crash somewhere to prove my point, or suddenly a plane with an impeccable safety record, such as the Concorde, would fall appallingly out of the sky. </p> <p>I pored over articles on specific crashes - the Valujet DC-9 that slammed into a Florida swamp, the TWA Boeing 747 that blew up in midair just out of JFK, the Swissair MD11 that came down in Nova Scotia, the Romanian A310 that barely had time to become airborne after leaving Bucharest airport. I read somewhere that all the pathologist had to identify the pilot of a Boeing 737 (the most popular commercial jet in the world) that crashed in Pittsburgh was the sole of his foot, a slither of charred flesh. A friend, who works for a big City bank, passed me an internal report that graded airlines by their safety records so its employees could decide which they would feel happiest flying with. I can tell you that at the bottom of this listwas Macedonian Airlines, closely followed by Azerbaijan Airlines, Kazakhstan Airlines and Orbi Georgian Airlines - not, of course, that I had ever flown with any of these. </p> <p>A short while later, the same friend (friend?) passed me some information that I thought at the time proved my phobia wasn't quite so irrational, that I'd been on the right track all along. It included the terrifying fact that cars are actually 12 times safer than planes and that, of all modes of transport, only motorbikes are more dangerous. This statistic was arrived at by calculating the number of trips taken, as opposed to the norm of looking at the deaths per distances travelled. Even, apparently, if you measure the fatality rate per man-hour of exposure to a particular form of transport, cars and planes come out pretty evenly. </p> <p>Gradually, I became aware of not just how common my condition was, but that I wasn't the only travel writer who was afraid of flying. Aside from numerous tales of head-banging turbulence and engine fires, aborted takeoffs and undercarriage failures, many of my former colleagues feared that because they flew so much, by the law of averages one day their time would be up. But regardless of all this, and irrespective of how you skew the figures (and even if there has just been a terrible crash - you can usually find at least one major incident in the world in any given month), flying is remarkably safe, and getting safer. The overall accident rate per flight stands at one in a million, well down from 50 in a million in the 60s. </p> <p>Yet, to the phobic mind, these figures are meaningless - the plane you are on is going to crash, and nothing anyone says can distract you from that thought. I like to think that I eventually left my travel editor job for other reasons (to concentrate on my novel-writing, say, and to spend more time with my new wife), but it is conceivable that my fear of flying played a considerable part. </p> <p>With my feet planted firmly on the ground, I began to question why flying affects so many people in such a negative way (some say up to half the adult population fear it) - why exactly it generates all this anxiety. I wondered whether I would ever be able to get on a plane without my palms becoming clammy and this heaving sensation starting up in my chest. In fact, I wondered whether I would ever be able to get on a plane again. Why was I being so bloody irrational about it? I just couldn't get my mind to accept the reality of the situation - that I wasn't going to die every time I stepped on to a plane, even if it were to be involved in an incident. Planes are obviously well built enough to withstand lightning strikes, as well as all sorts of mechanical and systems failures. I then started to think about the nature of phobias. My doctor intimated that what most phobias ultimately do is mask some other, probably deeper-rooted anxiety. So what else was troubling me? What had the Geneva incident really triggered? </p> <p>By the time I eventually enrolled on a fear-of-flying course, I had already got somewhere with containing my phobia, even if I hadn't yet got that far with understanding what lay behind it. I had decided to set my next novel on a plane, thinking that an object capable of inspiring such powerful feelings in me would provide great source material. Or, if you like, I wanted to put my obsession, my pre-eminent anxiety, to good use. Plus, I've always thought of my writing as a kind of therapy, a way of exorcising demons, of trying to confront long-buried issues - of working out who I am and where I come from. And I also wanted to know what made the cabin crew tick, what made them able to spend their lives flying around the world fearlessly. As it was, I soon discovered that they aren't all that fearless. </p> <p>A friend who once worked for Virgin told me how turbulence used to frighten her so badly that she often found herself screaming out loud, much to the alarm of nearby passengers. She resigned after a particularly bumpy transatlantic flight. A senior BA purser I came across said that he was fine to begin with, but that after almost a decade he couldn't cope with it any more unless he took a Valium. And, in the course of my research, I heard numerous other tales of drug and alcohol dependency among cabin crew, of people locking themselves in the crew rest area, of people not going to work at all because flying suddenly scared the wits out of them. </p> <p>In the course of my research, I managed a number of flights (specifically eight - four return trips to New York, which is the route in my book) without resorting to my usual cocktail of beer and beta-blockers, by convincing myself that because I was writing a novel set on a plane it would be too extraordinary for me to die in a plane crash. I felt I was somehow invincible - which, if nothing else, illustrates how phobias can really twist your mind, your rationality. At least I was able to concentrate on my surroundings, trying to observe everything in the name of research, rather than worry about a bomb going off in the cargo hold, or the chances of being in a midair collision. </p> <p>In the past, I hadn't even been able to look out of the window and always asked for an aisle seat, then I'd cower behind newspapers and magazines. Now, I'd stare at the cloud formations, the sun dipping behind a cresting wave of stratocumulus, and think, yeah, actually this is pretty beautiful. I'd listen to the steady, almost reassuring trilling of the engines, rather than turn up the volume on my headset. I'd no longer fight the sense of motion, but let my body relax into the seat (as much as that's ever possible). </p> <p>It was amazing, too, watching the cabin crew scuttling up and down the aisles, dealing with demanding passengers, handing out the hot meals (or \"hots\", as they say in the business), and every so often checking that their hair was in place. I suppose what slowly struck me - and this was after I had ventured into numerous galleys for a gossip - was the fact that they weren't some alien species. They were just like you and me - certainly me, in the way they worried about their relationships and their social lives, about their job security and who was bitching about them behind their back. Except everything seemed to be so condensed. It was as if they were operating on fast-forward. They weren't just suddenly overfamiliar with each other; they had affairs and bust-ups on one-night stopovers that would have taken months to materialise in normal jobs. Taking all this in suddenly seemed much more interesting than worrying about the plane crashing. </p> <p>So when I turned up for the fear-of-flying course - which I had booked months beforehand - I was feeling surprisingly confident thanks to this whole new agenda my phobia had provoked and the knowledge (both social and technical) that I had already gained through my research. In many ways, I felt that I had largely overcome my fear of flying, or at least had learned to cope with it. I honestly believed that the BA-approved course would be a breeze, that I might come top of the class. </p> <p>What I did not realise was that most people who are seriously afraid of flying know an enormous amount about it. There were people attending (about 150 in all, and a pretty even mix between men and women) who recalled crashes I'd never heard of, people who could describe the workings of a modern aircraft just as competently as the smooth-talking pilots taking the course. And whenever one of the course instructors said some flight system or particular control was infallible - bound by what is known in the industry as in-built redundancy - there was always someone who could successfully contradict him. </p> <p>\"Turbulence is not comfortable,\" we were told to recite, \"but it is not dangerous.\" Which, sadly, isn't quite true, someone pointed out - a number of passengers have apparently died in midair due to severe turbulence. And planes aren't immune to lightning strikes, either - in 1976, an Iranian jumbo jet was reported to have exploded after being struck just outside Madrid. </p> <p>My early confidence quickly subsided - the gloomy surroundings of the bland Heathrow airport hotel, where the course was being held, didn't help. I had clearly been kidding myself that I had somehow got over my fear of flying. In fact, what I had probably been doing was just hiding it, or, I suppose, smothering it behind the whole idea of my novel. As we moved on from the technical aspects of the course to the mental issues, it became increasingly apparent that I had been ignoring the issue of phobias and, more important, what really lies behind them (and concentrating on cabin crew gossip instead). It transpires that people afflicted with a fear of flying roughly divide into two groups. There are those whose fear comes from unfamiliarity with the experience and those who, for whatever reason, have developed a phobia. The first lot are easy enough to treat. It's the second lot, people like me, who are the problem. </p> <p>The psychotherapists, who came along for the afternoon, tried, much as my doctor had, to suggest that it is ourselves who are making us anxious and not the aircraft. They said that very often fear is self-administered and that we simply allow our imaginations to play tricks on us. However, they didn't go much beyond telling us to think of pleasant thoughts - ie, to indulge in a bit of positive thinking, which, to a degree, I had already started to do. Mind you, I can't blame them for not expanding further on the issue - it probably would have taken them a few years to sort us lot out, not an afternoon. One of them said something, however, shortly before we were to board the plane for our \"test\" flight, that took me right back to the Geneva incident. </p> <p>\"Remember,\" this patient, soft-voiced, middle-aged woman said, \"anxiety breeds anxiety.\" The time my plane was struck by lightning just so happened to coincide with a great change in my life. I had recently become engaged, accepted a new job, put my flat on the market, sold my first novel, and, I suddenly recalled, been mugged. I'm now certain that the shock of the lightning strike had somehow jumbled all this up in my mind. </p> <p>All my anxiety about having been mugged, and concern over whether my first novel, new job and quite possibly impending marriage would all be the huge success I hoped them to be, shifted on to the very tangible experience of flying. What was suddenly so good about life became confused because of a traumatic experience. </p> <p>I'm not sure how effective the course was in getting me to recognise this, or whether I was moving, albeit slowly, in that direction (or maybe even the opposite direction), anyway. I'm not sure that you could say I was your normal fear-of-flying candidate, being a novelist and perhaps particularly susceptible to neuroses and heightened levels of anxiety. Though from the people I met on the course (and while researching my novel), I reckon a phobia about flying can hit anyone, even an air steward. It took me a long while - almost three years - to recognise all this, and also the very obvious and related fact that flying is about letting go or, rather, relinquishing control (unless you happen to be the pilot). </p> <p>In a way, I see overcoming my phobia - or at least beginning to understand what lay behind it - as a sign of growing up, as a sign of finally accepting that the world doesn't just revolve around me. However, part of me can't help feeling increasingly queasy about having now actually written this novel set on a plane - a novel, as it has turned out, about not just flying but also about relationships and commitment, desire and anxiety. </p> <p>I haven't flown since publication day, because I am worried that I might just be tempting fate once again. The one, probably very obvious, question that I can't recall being asked on the course, was: \"What do you do if the phobia returns?\" As with alcoholism, or any form of addiction, do you ever really get over a fear of flying? </p> <p>\u0095 Henry Sutton is the author of Flying, published by Sceptre, priced \u00a314.99.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Book of Kings </strong> <br> James Thackara <br> 773pp, Duckworth<br> \u00a319.99 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502453177,00.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Buy it at BOL</a><br></p> <p> Ambition is a laudable quality in a writer, but so is humility, and to assume the mantle of Tolstoy in order to attempt an epic novel on the Third Reich is an enterprise full of possible pitfalls. In addition, the novel as a literary form has moved on in the past 150 years; it is questionable whether a book as great as its subject is still possible in what is now a dated, if not wholly outdated, form. As a conventional novelist, James Thackara does not address this question, and his book leaves it unanswered; 25 years in the writing, it remains an ambitious failure. </p> <p>Tolstoy had the good sense to stick, for the most part, to what he knew, which was Russia; he knew where his heart was too. Thackara is an American, and his narrative is all over the place, since he collects a small bunch of principal characters of various nationalities and then follows their movements over large parts of the globe. As a result one tends to doubt his credibility, particularly since he peppers his text with bits of German that are almost invariably inaccurate. </p> <p>The selection of characters Thackara chooses to focus on is also rather odd, creating a distinctly lopsided view of the second world war. England and the rest of the British are excluded, which is a bit like writing an account of Waterloo with no Duke of Wellington. The narrative begins in 1932 with four students sharing a Paris flat - two Germans, an American and, oddly, a half-caste youth from Algeria. This is a bunch of young people having a good time and not yet interested in politics, apart from Justin Lothaire, the Algerian, who was politicised by childhood poverty and has a burning ambition to be a writer. David von Sunda will turn out to be a good but ineffectual German and Johannes Godard a silly, misguided one. Duncan Penn is a spare part, doing absolutely nothing in the US for several hundred pages until he has his moment of glory as an all-American hero, and promptly gets killed. </p> <p>Conscious of the immensity of his subject - its 50 million dead - and anxious to avoid the plodding prose of the blockbuster, Thackara adopts a high-flown, poetic style that sets one's teeth on edge. On the other hand, he does know how to keep an eventful narrative moving, so that one skims hastily over the stylistic infelicities in order to find out what happens next; and both the story and the characters are refreshingly unpredictable. </p> <p>David von Sunda marries a Frenchwoman and leaves for Mexico as war becomes inevitable. To avoid his family property being confiscated, he later comes back and joins the Wehrmacht. Being a good German, he gets embroiled with the July plot to kill Hitler, but is too cowardly to do the deed when he gets the chance in the Adlon Hotel and deserts from the Russian front, ending up in a forced labour camp as a wanted man. His brother is executed, but David survives to be reunited with his wife and children. After the war he turns down a job at the UN in favour of rebuilding the family fortune in South America. </p> <p>The problem with his friend Johannes, meanwhile, is that his head has been clouded by too much German philosophy, while his body is in thrall to the sexual charms of a Wagnerian soprano - a fatal combination. When, belatedly, the scales fall from his eyes and he finds out that his Nazi cronies are a bunch of murdering thugs, he tries to make a run for it and gets bumped off by the Gestapo. </p> <p>The time has now come, dear reader, for America to save the world. Enter Duncan Penn, along with seven million others, raring to go - even if it is 1944 and not 1939. \"In the US 3rd Army, there was impatience at the scholarly pace of Field Marshal Montgomery's joint invasion plan.\" I seem to remember that the impatience was all on Churchill and Monty's side, and that if Montgomery had had his way the Allies would have been in Berlin by Christmas, the war shortened and Russia held back. Instead Patton and the 3rd Army took the less risky option of heading south. Here Thackara behaves just like Hollywood, which has been annoying war-weary Britons with its \"How America won the war\" films since 1945. Dunkirk does not get a mention, even though much of the action takes place in occupied France; it might raise awkward questions on the whereabouts of Duncan Penn and his compatriots when their help was most needed and not given. </p> <p>Another significant absence is the Jews, mentioned as a \"race\" being exterminated rather as if they lived on the moon. They were of course an integral part of European life; every character in this novel would in reality have been confronted by personal dilemmas when asked to help desperate individuals. But not a word. Even Justin, who is in the Resistance, never hides a Jew, gets one over the frontier or fights alongside one. </p> <p>A novelist is entitled to choose his characters and the events he relates, but when it comes to the catastrophe at the heart of the 20th century too much has been written, too many still live to remember and even the myths have become too strong for a mere author to disregard.</p>",
  "The international net around Slobodan Milosevic tightened yesterday as Russia, for so long his main ally, ruled out providing a bolthole for the indicted war criminal. <p>The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, in a further blow to Mr Milosevic, recognised the new government of Vojislav Kostunica. </p> <p>The US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, welcomed the announcement: \"This is great news,\" she said. \"I cannot tell you how important it is and how important it is to the Yugoslav people.\" </p> <p>Mr Milosevic's other main ally, China, did not rule out offering a haven but hinted it was unlikely, expressing strong doubts about becoming involved in the crisis. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic's overseas options were narrowing to Iraq or Libya. Belarus said it would consider any asylum application but, as its government is heavily dependent on Moscow, that option looks increasingly unlikely. </p> <p>Cyprus froze all Yugoslav bank accounts, making flight overseas harder. But its central bank denied reports that Mr Milosevic and his cronies funnelled huge amounts of cash to Cypriot offshore accounts. </p> <p>The two neighbouring countries that would have provided the likeliest escape routes overland, Bulgaria and Romania, announced Mr Milosevic would be arrested if he crossed into their territory. </p> <p>He was still in Serbia last night insisting he would remain involved in Serbian politics. But there are many with scores to settle and the war crimes tribunal in the Hague is insisting it wants him to stand trial.</p>",
  "Still bunkered down in his villa in a leafy Belgrade suburb, despite rumour and counter-rumour about his attempted flight abroad, Slobodan Milosevic yesterday broadcast his defiance of Serbia and the rest of the world. <p>He may be tilting at windmills. The kingdom of fear he has ruled for 13 years has vanished, his world is in tatters. But he spoke as though he were still in charge, denouncing the popular revolution that has overthrown him as \"violence\", and \"destructive riots weakening\" Serbia and playing into the hands of its enemies. </p> <p>On a day that the country found it had more friends than it has had for a decade, the intransigent statement smacked of paranoia. Mr Milosevic has cultivated a siege mentality among Serbs for years to cement his power. It may be that he has begun to believe his own propaganda. </p> <p>The only international government figure to shake hands with the new president of Yugoslavia, Vojislav Kostunica, and to get a chance to gauge Mr Milosevic's temper, was Igor Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, who sped to Belgrade at dawn yesterday. </p> <p>Borislav Milosevic, the indicted war criminal's elder brother and ambassador in Moscow, insisted that Mr Milosevic remained head of state, at least for the time being. \"There are rules for the transfer of power. These should be followed. There is a set period of time - in America I think it's two months,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Ivanov spent 45 minutes with Mr Milosevic at his villa at 15 Uzicka Street, in the suburb of Dedinje, accompanied by the hardline Yugoslav army chief of staff, Nebojsa Pavkovic, and other military leaders. The regime's foreign minister, Zivodin Jovanovic, was also there, describing Moscow as \"a friend of Yugoslavia\". </p> <p>The question was whether Moscow was still a friend of Mr Milosevic. The Russian minister said little after the meeting, but Russian sources claimed that loyalist crack units of interior ministry troops and the army were heading towards Belgrade from Nis in the south, and from Montenegro, to defend the fallen despot. </p> <p>In neighbouring Bulgaria, senior officials also predicted that Mr Milosevic could still be a menace. \"It's possible that Milosevic could still have resources for a counter-attack,\" said Ivan Kostov, the Bulgarian prime minister. </p> <p>But Mr Milosevic appeared to have few props left. His last potential international support collapsed when Russia recognised Mr Kostunica as president after a week of sitting on the fence. With Mr Milosevic stripped of his Russian card, the main speculation centred on whether the 59-year-old cigarillo smoker with a penchant for Scotch would seek sanctuary abroad. And if so, where and how. </p> <p>He appears to believe he is entitled to stay put and devote himself to leading his Socialist party of Serbia, which remains the single biggest party. It is as if no one has told him there has been a revolution. </p> <p>Dmitry Rogozin, a senior Russian for eign policy official who has been in close contact with Belgrade throughout the crisis, said Mr Milosevic \"fell into a deep depression\" after losing the presidential election to Mr Kostunica a fortnight ago. A brooding recluse and diabetic, he is known to suffer from periodic bouts of depression. It was not clear yesterday whether Mirjana Markovic, his strong-willed wife who, if anything, is even more hated in Serbia than Mr Milosevic, was still in Belgrade, or whether the couple's son and daughter were still there. </p> <p>His brother dismissed all such talk of depression and of escape plans. \"There are absolutely no reasons to leave the country. These are rumours being spread to give credence to rumours about him being demoralised... Why should he leave the country? Half the population supports him. He is the leader of a major party.\" </p> <p>But reporting to Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, on his talks in Belgrade, Mr Ivanov and his boss \"considered measures needed to maintain peace\" in Yugoslavia. Since Mr Milosevic's continued presence in the country is widely seen as the biggest threat to peace, it appeared likely that his safe haven options were also discussed with the Russians. The German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, and Mr Putin also discussed the dilemmas later yesterday. They are also believed to have discussed Mr Milosevic's exit options in Moscow on September 25, the day after Mr Kostunica's poll victory. </p> <p>Iraq, China, Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus have all been mentioned as possible boltholes. Mr Milosevic's three lost Balkan wars made refugees of more than 3m people. Now his family may share their fate - displaced and homeless. </p> <p>Along with the indicted Bosnian Serb war criminals Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, he is the world's most wanted man. The Hague tribunal indicted him for war crimes in Kosovo last year and is seeking to charge him with further war crimes in Bosnia and Croatia. </p> <p>That makes it highly unlikely that the Kremlin would give him a safe haven. The Russian prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, said yesterday that the asylum issue \"has not been raised or discussed in that way... We are far from assuming that we have to consider the matter in that light.\" </p> <p>More hopefully for Mr Milosevic, the prime minister of Belarus, Vladimir Yermoshin, said that Minsk would consider approaches for \"political asylum\", but that none had been made. His boss, President Alexander Lukashenko, said that no one from the Belgrade regime had requested sanctuary. </p> <p>\"He has many options,\" said Mr Lukashenko. \"Milosevic simply has no grounds for leaving Yugoslavia.\" </p> <p>Despite the statements from Borislav Milosevic, the ambassador admitted last night that he had not spoken to his younger brother yesterday. </p> <p>Apart from sticking unfailingly and triumphantly to his line that Mr Milosevic had to go, Mr Kostunica has made no threatening noises towards the Milosevic family or the regime. He has repeatedly said he will not hand over Mr Milosevic to the tribunal in the Hague, which he views as an illegitimate political tool of the west. </p> <p>But if Mr Kostunica lacks rancour and vengefulness, it is not clear that will be able to rein in hotter tempers bent on meting out rough justice to the hated Milosevic family and the former regime's retinue of cronies and criminals. </p> <p>It appeared that the Russian mediation in Belgrade yesterday was aimed at preempting any such bloodshed, though it was not clear how. Mr Putin departed for his home town of St Petersburg last night on the eve of his birthday without providing any clues as to what should become of Mr Milosevic.</p>",
  "<p>For me, the most brilliant bit of that altogether brilliant film Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory is the scene where Veruca Salt, the monstrously spoilt muppet, sings her ode to greed and gluttony, I Want It Now. (\"I want a room full of music and laughter/Ten thousand tons of ice cream/And if I don't get the things that I'm after/I'm going TO SCREAM.\") I've seen this scene now with four separate people that I've been married to/going steady with, and each time my love object has turned to me with a look of pure glee and recognition on their faces. And this used to happen when I was really thin, too, so you can wipe that smirk off right away. </p> <p>Wanting gets a pretty bad press these days, so most people, when they want a thing, say they need it instead. I've never understood this, and consider it far more morally dubious and all-round undignified to need something rather than to want it. \"Needy\", to my mind, is about as unattractive a way for a person to act as is possible, whereas being \"wanty\" indicates a healthy level of self-worth and faith in one's own judgments. And yet \"Because I want to\" is still a phrase that strikes many people as being a cue for anarchy - we try to stop children saying it as soon as possible, usually by trumping them with that gem of killer logic, \"Because I say so\". </p> <p>Women, especially, are not meant to want things. That's why the aromatherapy racket has proved so successful. The perfectly natural impulse to want things to smell nice can no longer be dismissed as mindless extravagance, as perfume might be, but as a necessity that is actually good for one's soul. When did you last hear a woman say, \"Because I want to\"? No; instead, she stripped off to empower herself, she committed adultery because her needs weren't being met, she got pie-eyed because she saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus. The last gal I heard saying it was the then 15-year-old Billie Piper, in that incredibly bratty chart-topper of the same name. Well, it only took a couple of years to knock that sort of sass out of her, and now poor Billie spends most of her waking hours denying that she takes drugs, drinks to excess and chucks celebrity boyfriends in order to get publicity for her records. Not so much Because I Want To as I Didn't Do It, Honest! </p> <p>There seems to be a feeling that if people do what they want and make no bones about it, society will somehow collapse. On the contrary, I believe that denying our desires and excusing them as needs causes a lot more trouble than being straightforward about our selfishness would. A society that recognised that people generally do as they want would stand very little nonsense from the two men per week who kill their wives, partners and exes, usually pleading diminished responsibility and claiming they were \"driven\" to it by \"nagging\" or \"taunting\" witches; the same goes for child molesters who \"couldn't help themselves\". Of course, we've got to be understanding and sensitive and all that guff but, if someone really wanted to use that old line about not knowing what came over them in order to wangle a lighter sentence, I'd sure as hell make sure they had their voting rights automatically removed, too; we don't let mad people vote, after all. And if you deny that you have free will and are so weak that you can, in fact, have your actions dictated to you by the liquid distilled from a rotting potato (vodka), as alcoholics do, are you really any more deserving of your stake in democracy than a man who thinks he's Napoleon? </p> <p>I'd have a lot more respect for even nasty people if they just admitted why they do what they do - because they want to. If only a bloke from the Countryside Alliance would stand up just once on Newsnight and say, \"Well, Jeremy, the thing is I get the most enormous stiffy when I see that damned attractive little fox bitch being torn apart, and what's wrong with that, what?\" But, instead, they wheel out a load of cant about the fox enjoying it (just like rapists!) and it being necessary for the countryside, otherwise all the trees would fall down. People who work in animal labs are another lot: they're sadists, and there's no two ways about it. Why not come out and admit it? They'd probably find that, in the long run, people would be far more understanding and tolerant of their sadism than they are of all those transparent lies about a new mango-and-apple shampoo being absolutely vital for the future survival of mankind and therefore worth the sight of a couple of hundred beagles. Hell, if they came out and said that they were addicted to hurting animals, they'd probably get on Richard And Judy, sharing sniffles and big feely hugs with Denise The Agony Aunt. </p> <p> Very few things are truly addictive: heroin, for instance, bends over backwards to let potential addicts off the hook, making most people extremely ill the first few times they take it. It is probably harder to become addicted to heroin than to kick it. Yet junkies, and particularly the families and spouses of junkies, clamour for it to be recognised as a \"disease\", which is pretty damned insulting to people dying of cancer. To my knowledge, no one went out and deliberately gave themselves cancer because they admired a famous cancer-sufferer's cheekbones or because the Velvet Underground had some really cool songs about it. Most alleged drug addicts don't \"need\" drugs at all; they merely want to need them, because simply wanting them would seem so selfish and swinish. The same goes for shopaholics (want nice things), chocaholics (greedy pigs), sexaholics (slags) and workaholics (can't stand the person they're married to and their whining offspring, so stay at the office all hours God sends). As for alcoholics, they're just self-pitying drunks, and sometimes they're not even that - just people with very dreary inner lives who need a bit of identity and status, however warped. I recently read of an American actress who started attending AA meetings because she was having two Martinis each night after work. Two frigging Martinis! </p> <p>As people become less willing to stand up and identify themselves as communists or Christians or anything that might be ridiculed as highfalutin or judgmental, they are clamouring to be this-aholics or that-dependants. Apart from anything else, this has upped the bore-quotient at parties something chronic. But, on a more serious level, it has also turned us into a nation of babies, forever mewling at the teat of addiction. How much braver and bolder - and, yes, how much more socially responsible - is my favourite Spanish proverb: \"Take what you want, and pay for it, says God.\"</p>",
  "The time has come to face up to it: my birthday is on the horizon. To tell the truth, I have little time for birthdays; I don't really like the formality that often accompanies the celebration meal. Instead, my favourite form of dining is the long lunch that drifts on into evening. Companionship and great victuals are the real point of such gatherings, and, in an ideal world, they would occur at random and frequently throughout the year. <p>Mind you, when the boss told me that I could have anything at all for my birthday meal ... wow! Flights of fancy, such as caviar, Hollywood-style, came rushing to mind: as in Garbo as Anna Karenina, dipping into a great heap of ice-cooled sturgeon roe. \"What?\" I cried. \"Money no object?\" No, there's a cap of \u00a310 a head, came back the stern reply. Meanness itself. But perhaps it's better that way: the problem with such grandiose productions is that everything generally looks better on paper. Remember Babette's Feast? </p> <p>No, I would resist the dread words of \"theme\" and \"different\"; I'd just be myself, and cook a simple, elegant, robust meal, and hope for my favourite presents, a bottle of good fizz and an armload of cut flowers. Glad company, hearth and home would create the mise en sc\u00e8ne. </p> <p>So, what to begin with? A starter is a pivotal dish, critical in relaxing all into the meal, and therefore requires a great deal of consideration. While prepping in the restaurant, dwelling on this subject, in walked Mr Beale, a stout fellow with a twinkle in his eye and one of the ruddiest complexions I've ever seen. He was making his once-a-week delivery of the very best smoked eel, and it occurred to me that a dish of Beale's Eels' finest would do splendidly: sliced thinly, accompanied by crisp bacon, a really good poached egg and some horseradish to enliven the whole. </p> <p>Generally speaking, I prefer that a main course should be a dish of simplicity, with the principal ingredient - be that fish, meat, fowl or game - of the finest provenance, and cooked and accompanied in a manner that complements the raw material. That is, after all, the mark of all good cooking. The presentation should be without fuss or fanfare, letting the prime ingredient take its rightful place as the star of the meal. </p> <p>Well, it's a great theory, but what on earth was this dish fit for my birthday to be? It occurred to me that I rarely, if ever, eat veal these days. Sure, I have it on the menu at the restaurant, but its price is such (on account of the calves being hand-reared) that we can't afford to waste any of it, let alone allow any to slip off in the direction of the staff. So, veal is what I chose. The best veal dishes are Italian and, seeing as it is my birthday, a small taste of La Dolce Vita seems a perfectly reasonable request: cream sauces have been given a very bad press of late - of course, cream in every sauce in every meal is silly and lethal to a waistline and heart alike - but, every now and again, and cooked simply, a cream sauce is delicious. And when that sauce is charged with capers and anchovies and grappa et al and then spooned over a veal chop, it is very, very good indeed. </p> <p>I must confess to preferring no vegetables here, save for a few freshly gathered small potatoes, all waxy and delicious, and anointed with a little butter. In fact, I would prefer, instead, some really good cheese to have later on - a cracking good Cheddar or one of those dreamily creamy Irish cheeses, such as Durrus, with that patchy crust coloured varying hues of pink to beige, and the cheese itself all soft and yielding to the touch; or Cashel Blue, so rich and glorious. </p> <p>In the same manner as the devoted oenophile whose choice of wine will determine the choice of food, the ice cream I choose will determine the pudding to partner (in my book, ice cream is a must at any party). Coffee makes a great ice cream, one of the best in fact, yet it is all too rarely seen these days. Coffee ice cream with chocolate sauce is a very good combination; even better is coffee ice cream spooned into a chocolate souffl\u00e9 - a heavenly mix. </p> <p>The final, and most important, ingredient required to make this dinner special is the time to sit and enjoy the fruits of one's labours. </p> <p> All recipes serve six. </p> <p><b> Smoked eel salade - a wonderful composed salad. </b></p> <p> 600g smoked eel fillet </p> <p>12 rashers very good streaky bacon </p> <p>18 small waxy potatoes </p> <p>1 tbsp red-wine vinegar </p> <p>4 tbsp top-quality olive oil </p> <p>1 tsp chopped flat-leaf parsley </p> <p>1 tsp caster sugar </p> <p>1 tsp white-wine vinegar </p> <p>3 tbsp double cream </p> <p>1 dssp grated fresh horseradish </p> <p>Salt and pepper </p> <p>6 fresh free-range eggs </p> <p>Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. Lay the rashers of bacon on a rack and cook them in the oven until crisp and well coloured. Scrub the potatoes clean, and boil them until cooked through. </p> <p>While they are still warm, peel the spuds and toss them in the red-wine vinegar, oil, salt and a little pepper. When they are cool, cut the potatoes into slices and toss with a little more oil and the parsley. </p> <p>Dissolve the caster sugar and a pinch of salt in the white-wine vinegar, then add the cream and horseradish (by all means up the quantity of horseradish if you like), and stir. </p> <p>Thinly slice the eel and set to one side. Set a pan of water on the cooker, and bring to the boil. Add a spoonful of white-wine vinegar, then crack the eggs into six small cups. Poach the eggs in their cups for three to four minutes, until the white is cooked and the yolk runny. Have to hand six plates, and on them pile all the ingredients one upon the other, starting with the potatoes and finishing with the bacon, and serve at once. </p> <p><b> Veal chop with ham, anchovies, capers and grappa - a splendid dish that is both simple and unusual. Also, it is not without a hint of La Dolce Vita, so it's ideal celebration food. It is worth noting that British veal is dark and extremely delicious. </b></p> <p> 2 tbsp capers </p> <p>6 good anchovy fillets </p> <p>160g thickly sliced boiled ham </p> <p>6 veal chops, around 2.5cms thick </p> <p>Vegetable oil, for frying </p> <p>Salt and pepper </p> <p>60g unsalted butter </p> <p>4 tbsp grappa </p> <p>6 tbsp whipping cream</p> <p>If the capers are salted, rinse them and then chop roughly. If they are preserved in vinegar, chop them roughly. Finely chop the anchovies and cut the ham into small cubes. Liberally pepper and lightly salt the veal. Heat a large, heavy-based frying pan and into it pour a thin layer of light oil. Gently lay the veal in the oil - do not cram the meat in the pan; if need be, do the chops in two or more batches or in two frying pans. Leave the chops to cook, undisturbed, until a rich, brown crust has formed on one side, about seven minutes or so. Turn over the chops, and repeat - do not fall prey to the temptation to prod or lift the meat in any way. Seven minutes on both sides will cook the veal to a splendid medium-rare (if you prefer it more or less well done, reduce or increase the cooking time accordingly). </p> <p>Transfer the chops to a warm dish. Add the butter to the pan, stir in the chopped anchovy until it has almost dissolved, then add the capers and ham, and stir to coat thoroughly. Tip in the grappa and, while it bubbles away, scrape up any residue adhering to the bottom of the pan. Stir in the cream, let it simmer for a bare minute, then set the veal on the dining plates and anoint each with sauce. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Chocolate souffle with coffee ice cream - having got your souffl\u00e9 (or, indeed, the individual souffl\u00e9s) to the table, break the crust and spoon in a generous helping of the ice cream. Eat swiftly, as it really is marvellous. The ice cream, from Elizabeth David's Italian Food, is the best recipe I know, and at its best churned just a few hours before eating (the custard for it can, however, be made the day before). You really need an ice-cream machine for this. </b> </p> <p>For the ice cream... </p> <p> 430ml cream </p> <p>A scratch of lemon zest </p> <p>110g freshly roasted coffee beans </p> <p>6 egg yolks </p> <p>110g sugar</p> <p>Set a pan of water on to boil. Take a bowl that will sit happily on the pot without touching the water and reduce the heat to a murmuring simmer. Put the cream, lemon zest, coffee beans and egg yolks in the bowl, and sit it upon the pot. Stir gently and steadily until the mixture thickens considerably. Remove the bowl from the heat, stir in the sugar, and leave to cool (upon a bowl of ice, if necessary). Churn according to the instructions of your ice-cream machine. </p> <p>For the souffl\u00e9... </p> <p>Butter </p> <p>100g plain chocolate </p> <p>2 tbsp strong coffee </p> <p>30g cornflour </p> <p>600ml milk </p> <p>60g sugar </p> <p>30g unsalted butter </p> <p>3 egg yolks </p> <p>5 egg whites </p> <p>1 tbsp sugar </p> <p>Icing sugar, for dusting</p> <p>Generously butter and lightly flour a souffl\u00e9 bowl (or six individual souffl\u00e9 moulds) and tie a collar(s) of greaseproof paper around it (or them). Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5, and move the shelf to the middle of the oven. </p> <p>Put the chocolate and coffee in a small bowl over a small pan of simmering water, and stir until melted and smooth. Slake the cornflour with three tablespoons of milk and, when you have a smooth paste, beat the rest of the milk along with the 60g sugar into the flour mix and tip into a saucepan. Bring to a boil over a high heat, remove from the flame and stir in the chocolate and coffee, scraping down all the mixture from the sides of the bowl. Dot the surface of the milk/chocolate mix with butter and leave to cool. </p> <p>In a scrupulously cleaned bowl, beat the egg whites until voluminous and peaked. Add a tablespoon of sugar and carry on beating until stiff. Scrape the chocolate mix into a separate bowl and beat in the egg yolks. Fold in first a quarter of the egg-white mixture, then the rest, a third at a time, taking care to maintain as much volume as possible. Pour the mixture into the mould(s). At this stage, the souffl\u00e9 mix can sit for several hours, lightly covered, until it is required. Remember, the dessert is best served straight from the oven. </p> <p>Bake for 35 minutes, then dust the top with icing sugar and cook for a further 10 minutes (individual souffl\u00e9s will take only 15-20 minutes). Insert a needle to check that the souffl\u00e9 is cooked through - and if it comes away clean, then you can be sure the souffl\u00e9 is done. </p> <p>To serve, crack the top of the souffl\u00e9 with a spoon and drop the ice cream within. One might even think about adding some Cognac ... </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 Jeremy Lee is chef at Blue Print Cafe, Butlers Wharf, London SE1.</p>",
  "'I'm getting married, dear,' my mother announced. 'Paul's a retired policeman. I'm sure you'll like him.' This was bound to happen: being dropped by her young Spanish lover has triggered a conservative revival in her, and Daily Mail readers are always vulnerable to the appeal of marriage, but still ... <p>'Have you divorced Mike?' I asked, just in case. </p> <p>'In my heart, of course. But I've been told you can have a 24-hour divorce via the internet. I need your help.' I thought she must have been to the pub early (her local is one of those half-timbered places with 'Europe Sucks/Join Nafta' stickers on the leaded glass, so it's open day and night). However, I entered 'quick divorce' into the search engine window, and she was right. 'You can have a 24-hour divorce in Mexico through <a href=\"http://www.quick-divorce.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.quick-divorce.com</a>', I told her, 'or a three-day divorce in Hispaniola or Haiti through <a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/biz/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.angelfire.com/biz/</a> divorce. Apparently, that was Diana Ross's choice.' </p> <p>'Oh, I must do that, then.

  "William Hague yesterday sacrificed a ritual Conservative conference triumph with a speech which reached out beyond the Tory heartlands in an attempt to woo disaffected blue collar Labour voters. <p>Seven months before the expected May election, the Tory leader used his 49-minute address in Bournemouth to tell floating voters that the Conservatives had learned from past mistakes and want to govern pragmatically \"for all the people\". </p> <p>He was firm on the need for tax cuts, but promised better health care and schools, inner city revival and pension rises, all services on which Labour is finally spending billions. </p> <p>The speech was strong in its populist tone - \"no government in recent times has been as tough on criminals as we will be\" - but conspicuously short on specific policies. </p> <p>Labour was quick to complain that the sums did not add up, and that \u00a316bn worth of cuts would follow a Tory victory. It was another key election issue to which Mr Hague made virtually no mention. </p> <p>Instead he mocked senior ministers and abused Tony Blair as an actor without principles \"who is prepared to say whatever will please his audience without the slightest consistent thought or principle entering his head\". </p> <p>What was immediately noticeable was that Mr Hague's oratory did not work its usual magic with the activists in the hall. His speech was punctuated by desultory applause, except during pledges to protect Britain's independence - and the pound - from the EU. </p> <p>So confident was he that his three year \"common sense revolution\" has reconnected the Tories with what he repeatedly called \"the mainstream majority\", the ordinary voters Labour has allegedly ignored, that he challenged Mr Blair to an immediate election. \"Go on Tony, call it now,\" he said. </p> <p>The volatile state of public opinion, which has seen Labour first lose, then regain an eight-point poll lead in the past month, makes it unlikely that Mr Hague wants his bluff called, especially after this week's mixed messages on social tolerance which pitted Ann Widdecombe against Michael Portillo yesterday. </p> <p>In a contrite tone which echoed Mr Blair's acknowledgement that voters are alienated by politicians, he said: \"I don't think we'll solve every problem, avoid every mistake... I just want to govern with the common sense instincts of the people.\" </p> <p>His assessment of those instincts was a blend of familiar rightwing nostrums on Europe, crime, asylum, tax and wasted public spending, and new efforts to persuade people that he understands the fears and aspirations of those who live on sink estates and struggle to pay their way. \"I'm in it for you,\" he kept saying. </p> <p>Given the mixed signals which some shadow ministers have delivered, Mr Hague said: \"There are some who say there is a contradiction between traditional Conservative issues and winning new Tory audiences; between tolerance and championing the mainstream values of the country. There is no contradiction. Being tough on crime, believing in lower taxes and the robust defence of our nation's independence are not in contradiction with wanting better schools and hospitals, and thriving inner cities. They are an essential part of achieving those things.\"</p>",
  "Russia today joined the rest of the world in accepting the new order in Yugoslavia, when it dramatically changed tack and congratulated Vojislav Kostunica as Yugoslavia's new leader. <p>Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, travelled to Belgrade conveying congratulations from Russian President Vladimir Putin to Mr Kostunica, the opposition leader being hailed by Western heads and even Yugoslav state media as the \"president-elect.\"</p> <p>Mr Kostunica's legitimacy was underlined as the European Union invited him to the EU-Balkans summit in Zagreb, Croatia, on November 24, according to French officials. </p> <p>In another move signalling the overthrow of the old order, former supporters of the disgraced former president, Slobodan Milosevic, in the republic of Montenegro declared their loyalty to the new president. Mr Milosevic, who presided over a disastrous dismemberment of Yugoslavia, was swept out of power in exuberant mass demonstrations in Belgrade yesterday. </p> <p>In keeping with the new mood, foreign secretary Robin Cook said that Yugoslavia had released two British policemen jailed for spying. </p> <p>Adrian Prangnell and John Yore were arrested in Montenegro in August with a Canadian colleague.</p> <p>Mr Cook welcomed the overthrow of Mr Milosevic, saying that sanctions against Yugoslavia could be lifted on Monday when the European parliament next meets. </p> <p>There is widespread speculation that Mr Milosevic will seek asylum abroad, possibly in Belarus, but the ousted leader's brother, who is Belgrade's ambassador in Moscow, said he was not planning to go anywhere. </p> <p>\"Why should he leave the country? Half the population openly supports him. He is the leader of a major party,\" said Borislav Milosevic. </p> <p>The ambassador said Mr Milosevic was still in Belgrade and would discuss his options with Mr Ivanov. President Bill Clinton has urged Russia, Yugoslav's traditional ally, to help resolve matters by persuading Mr Milosevic to quit.</p> <p>In the Kazakh capital, Astana, the Russian prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, said the question of asylum for Mr Milosevic in Russia \"has not been raised and is not being discussed\". Mr Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal by a UN tribunal in the Hague, and his status will be one of the tricky issues to be sorted out in the new Yugoslavia. </p> <p>The west has expressed its determination to put Mr Milosevic on trial for war crimes, whereas Mr Kostunica, a constitutional lawyer, has refused to recognise the Hague tribunal. Should Mr Milosevic fetch up in Russia, it would be expected to hand him over as it is a member of the UN security council.</p> <p>Tony Blair, in Warsaw for a speech on Europe, said: \"There is a legal process in respect to Milosevic. The most important thing now is for him to go... the legal process takes its course. Let us hope this is indeed the first day of liberation of the people of Serbia from President Milosevic.\" </p> <p>In Belgrade, jubilant crowds roamed the streets early this morning, celebrating the end of 13 years of Mr Milosevic's rule.</p> <p>Fears persist that there could be counterattacks by remnants of the discredited regime. Through the night, tens of thousands danced and sang in celebration of the seizure of Yugoslavia's parliament and other key symbols of the Milosevic regime.</p> <p>All state-owned media were working normally, broadcasting or publishing apologies for their past support for Mr Milosevic. </p> <p>Serb television occasionally flashed its logo during broadcasts, with the slogan: \"This is the new free Serbian television.\" </p> <p>State-owned or formerly pro-Milosevic dailies issued special editions reflecting the change in their editorial policies.</p> <p>Politika featured a front-page photograph of Mr Kostunica, his arm raised triumphantly in the air over a headline: \"Serbia on the road to democracy\".</p>",
  "<p>\"I have sold myself to the devil.\" </p> <p>\"Let me tell you about myself,\" replied Dr Hildegard Wolf, who had become Paris's most successful psychiatrist by virtually ignoring her patients for their first three sessions. </p> <p>\"I am Lord Lucan,\" Lucky eventually said a month later. \"There is another Lord Lucan in Paris at the moment,\" she replied, \"whom I am also seeing. He goes by the name of Walker.\" </p> <p>Hildegard reflected on the merits of the two Lord Lucans with her long-time companion, Jean-Pierre. \"It could be either or none of them.\" </p> <p>\"You are the fake stigmatic, Beate Pappenheim, who was exposed in 1986,\" said Walker at their next session. \"I take it you want money. Prove you are Lord Lucan and I'll pay you.\" </p> <p>\"Why didn't you tell me?\" asked Jean-Pierre. \"They must be in league together.\" </p> <p>\"I suppose your accomplice told you that I am Pappenheim,\" said Hildegard. </p> <p>\"I know the name, but I have no accomplice,\" replied Lucky. \"Do you think the lower orders bleed more than we aristocrats?\" </p> <p>\"Which of you is real?\" asked Hildegard. </p> <p>\"I am,\" said Walker. \"Lucky is my accomplice. I hired him to collect the money my friends put at my disposal.\" </p> <p>Hildegard fled to London. Ever since her secret had come out she had known she would have to go into hiding. Jean-Pierre rifled through her diary looking for clues to her whereabouts; he called a Dr Jacobs. \"London is where I would hide,\" said the doctor. </p> <p>\"I'm going to have to kill Walker,\" mused Lucky. He had been fortunate to have been given Walker by one of his friends in Mexico 10 years ago. But his usefulness was over. As Lucky's friends died off, the funds dried up and new DNA tests meant they could no longer pass off as one another. </p> <p>Jean-Pierre discussed the Lucan problem with Dr Jacobs. \"They need to go back to Africa.\" </p> <p>\"They went to work for my grandfather in central Africa,\" Jacobs later reported. \"Unfortunately, Lucky was clubbed to death and eaten by the children. My grandfather thought it would turn them into earls.\" </p> <p>\"And Walker?\" </p> <p>\"Back in Mexico.\" </p> <p>Suddenly, thought Hildegard, the world seemed a little cleaner. </p> <p><strong>And if you really are pressed: The digested read, digested:</strong> </p> <p>Dame Muriel puts her mind to Lord Lucan, who disappeared 25 years ago after the murder of his children's nanny.

  "<p>The rumour spread through the city like wildfire (which had quite often spread through Ankh-Morpork since its citizens had learned the words 'fire insurance'). </p> <p>The dwarfs can turn lead into gold... </p> <p>It buzzed through the fetid air of the Alchemists' quarter, where they had been trying to do the same thing for centuries without success but were certain that they'd manage it by tomorrow, or next Tuesday at least, or the end of the month for definite. </p> <p>It caused speculation among the wizards at Unseen University, where they knew you could turn one element into another element, provided you didn't mind it turning back again next day, and where was the good in that?

Everything's got 'em all mixed up just right.' </p> <p>He stamped his feet in an effort to get some warmth into them. </p> <p>'If it was possible to turn lead into gold, everyone'd be doing it,' he said. </p> <p>'Wizards could do it,' said Sergeant Colon. </p> <p>'Oh, well, magic,' said Nobby dismissively. </p> <p>A large cart rumbled out of the yellow clouds and entered the arch, splashing Colon as it wobbled through one of the puddles that were such a feature of Ankh-Morpork's highways. </p> <p>'Bloody dwarfs,' he said, as it continued on into the city. But he didn't say it too loudly. </p> <p>'There were a lot of them pushing that cart,' said Corporal Nobbs reflectively. It lurched slowly round a corner and was lost to view. </p> <p>'Prob'ly all that gold,' said Colon. </p> <p>'Hah. Yeah. That'd be it, then.' </p> <p>And the rumour came to the ears of William de Worde, and in a sense it stopped there, because he dutifully wrote it down. </p> <p>It was his job. Lady Margolotta of Uberwald sent him five dollars a month to do it. The Dowager Duchess of Quirm also sent him five dollars. So did King Verence of Lancre, and a few other Ramtop notables. So did the Seriph of Al Khali, although in his case the payment was half a cartload of figs, twice a year. </p> <p>All in all, he considered, he was on to a good thing. All he had to do was write one letter very carefully, trace it backwards on to a piece of boxwood provided for him by Mr Cripslock the engraver in the Street of Cunning Artificers, and then pay Mr Cripslock twenty dollars to carefully remove the wood that wasn't letters and make five impressions on sheets of paper. </p> <p>Of course, it had to be done thoughtfully, with spaces left after 'To my Noble Client the', and so on, which he had to fill in later, but even deducting expenses it still left him the best part of thirty dollars for little more than one day's work a month. </p> <p>A young man without too many responsibilities could live modestly in Ankh-Morpork on thirty or forty dollars a month; he always sold the figs, because although it was possible to live on figs you soon wished you didn't. </p> <p>And there were always additional sums to be picked up here and there. The world of letters was a closed book - mysterious papery object - to many of Ankh-Morpork's citizens, but if they ever did need to commit things to paper quite a few of them walked up the creaky stairs past the sign 'William de Worde: Things Written Down'. </p> <p>Dwarfs, for example. Dwarfs were always coming to seek work in the city, and the first thing they did was send a letter home saying how well they were doing. This was such a predictable occurrence, even if the dwarf in question was so far down on his luck that he'd been forced to eat his helmet, that William had Mr Cripslock produce several dozen stock letters which needed only a few spaces filled in to be perfectly acceptable. </p> <p>Fond dwarf parents all over the mountains treasured letters which looked something like this: </p> <p>Dear [Mume &amp; Dad],</p> <p>Well, I arrived here all right and I am staying, at [109 Cockbill Street The Shades Ankh-Morpk]. Everythyng is fine. I have got a goode job working for [Mr C.M.O.T. Dibbler, Merchant Venturer] and will be makinge lots of money really soon now. I am rememberinge alle your gode advyce and am not drinkynge, in bars or mixsing with Trolls. Well thas about itte mu\u0083t goe now, looking forwade to seing you and [Emelia] agane, your loving son,</p> <p> [Tomas Brokenbrow]</p> <p>... who was usually swaying while he dictated it. It was twenty pence easily made, and as an additional service William carefully tailored the spelling to the client and allowed them to choose their own punctuation. </p> <p>On this particular evening, with the sleet gurgling in the downspouts outside his lodgings, William sat in the tiny office over the Guild of Conjurors and wrote carefully, half listening to the hopeless but painstaking catechism of the trainee conjurors at their evening class in the room below. </p> <p>'... pay attention. Are you ready? Right. Egg. Glass ...' </p> <p>'Egg. Glass,' the class droned listlessly. </p> <p>'... Glass. Egg ...' </p> <p>'Glass. Egg ...' </p> <p>'... Magic word ...' </p> <p>'Magic word ...' </p> <p>''Fazammm. Just like that. Ahahahahaha ...' </p> <p>'Faz-ammm. Just like that. Aha-ha-ha-ha-ha ...' </p> <p>William pulled another sheet of paper towards him, sharpened a fresh quill, stared at the wall for a moment and then wrote as follows: </p> <p>And finally, on the lighter Side, it is being said that the Dwarfs can Turn Lead into Gold, though no one knows whence the rumour comes, and Dwarfs going about their lawful occa\u0083ions in the City are hailed with cries such as, e.g., 'Hollah, short stuff, let's see you make some Gold then!' although only Newcomers do this because all here know what happens if you call a Dwarf 'short stuff', viz., you are Dead. </p> <p>Yr. obdt. servant, William de Worde</p> <p>He always liked to finish his letters on a happy note. </p> <p>He fetched a sheet of boxwood, lit another candle and laid the letter face down on the wood. A quick rub with the back of a spoon transferred the ink, and thirty dollars and enough figs to make you really ill were as good as in the bank. </p> <p>He'd drop it into Mr Cripslock tonight, pick up the copies after a leisurely lunch tomorrow, and with any luck should have them all away by the middle of the week. </p> <p>William put on his coat, wrapped the wood block carefully in some waxed paper and stepped out into the freezing night. </p> <p>The world is made up of four elements: Earth, Air, Fire and Water. This is a fact well known even to Corporal Nobbs. It's also wrong. There's a fifth element, and generally it's called Surprise. </p> <p>For example, the dwarfs found out how to turn lead into gold by doing it the hard way. The difference between that and the easy way is that the hard way works. </p> <p>The dwarfs dwarfhandled their overloaded, creaking cart along the street, peering ahead in fog. Ice formed on the cart and hung from their beards. </p> <p>All it needed was one frozen puddle. </p> <p>Good old Dame Fortune. You can depend on her. </p> <p>The fog closed in, making every light a dim glow and muffling all sounds. It was clear to Sergeant Colon and Corporal Nobbs that no barbarian horde would be including the invasion of Ankh-Morpork in their travel plans for this evening. The watchmen didn't blame them. </p> <p>They closed the gates. This was not the ominous activity that it might appear, since the keys had been lost long ago and latecomers usually threw gravel at the windows of the houses built on top of the wall until they found a friend to lift the bar. It was assumed that foreign invaders wouldn't know which windows to throw gravel at. </p> <p>Then the two watchmen trailed through the slush and muck to the Water Gate, by which the river Ankh had the good fortune to enter the city. The water was invisible in the dark, but the occasional ghostly shape of an ice floe drifted past below the parapet. </p> <p>'Hang on,' said Nobby, as they laid hands on the windlass of the portcullis. 'There's someone down there.' </p> <p>'In the river?' said Colon. </p> <p>He listened. There was the creak of an oar, far below. </p> <p>Sergeant Colon cupped his hands around his mouth and issued the traditional policeman's cry of challenge. </p> <p>'Oi! You!' </p> <p>For a moment there was no sound but the wind and the gurgling of the water. Then a voice said: 'Yes?' </p> <p>'Are you invading the city or what?' </p> <p>There was another pause. Then: </p> <p>'What?' </p> <p>'What what?' said Colon, raising the stakes. </p> <p>'What were the other options?' </p> <p>'Don't mess me about ... Are you, down there in the boat, invading this city?' </p> <p>'No.' </p> <p>'Fair enough,' said Colon, who on a night like this would happily take someone's word for it. 'Get a move on, then, 'cos we're going to drop the gate.' </p> <p>After a while the splash of the oars resumed and disappeared downriver. </p> <p>'You reckon that was enough, just askin' 'em?' said Nobby. </p> <p>'Well, they ought to know,' said Colon. </p> <p>'Yeah, but-' </p> <p>'It was a tiny little rowin' boat, Nobby. Of course, if you want to go all the way down to them nice icy steps on the jetty-' </p> <p>'No, sarge.' </p> <p>'Then let's get back to the Watch House, all right?' </p> <p>William turned up his collar as he hurried towards Cripslock the engraver. The usually busy streets were deserted. Only those people with the most pressing business were out of doors. It was turning out to be a very nasty winter indeed, a gazpacho of freezing fog, snow and Ankh-Morpork's ever-present, ever-rolling smog. </p> <p>His eye was caught by a little pool of light by the Watchmakers' Guild. A small hunched figure was outlined in the glow. </p> <p>He wandered over. </p> <p>A hopeless sort of voice said, 'Hot sausages? Inna bun?' </p> <p>'Mr Dibbler?' said William. </p> <p>Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler, Ankh-Morpork's most enterprisingly unsuccessful businessman, peered at William over the top of his portable sausage-cooking tray. Snowflakes hissed in the congealing fat. </p> <p>William sighed. 'You're out late, Mr Dibbler,' he said politely. </p> <p>'Ah, Mr Word. Times is hard in the hot sausage trade,' said Dibbler. </p> <p>'Can't make both ends meat, eh?' said William. He couldn't have stopped himself for a hundred dollars and a shipload of figs. </p> <p>'Definitely in a period of slump in the comestibles market,' said Dibbler, too sunk in gloom to notice. 'Don't seem to find anyone ready to buy a sausage in a bun these days.' </p> <p>William looked down at the tray. If Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler was selling hot sausages, it was a sure sign that one of his more ambitious enterprises had gone wahoonie-shaped yet again. Selling hot sausages from a tray was by way of being the ground state of Dibbler's existence, from which he constantly sought to extricate himself and back to which he constantly returned when his latest venture went all runny. Which was a shame, because Dibbler was an extremely good hot sausage salesman. He had to be, given the nature of his sausages. </p> <p>'I should have got a proper education like you,' said Dibbler despondently. 'A nice job indoors with no heavy lifting. I could have found my nitch, if'n I'd have got a good education.' </p> <p>'Nitch?' </p> <p>'One of the wizards told me about 'em,' said Dibbler. 'Everything's got a nitch. You know. Like: where they ought to be. What they was cut out for?' </p> <p>William nodded. He was good with words. 'Niche?' he said. </p> <p>'One of them things, yes.' Dibbler sighed. 'I missed out on the semaphore. Just didn't see it coming. Next thing you know, everyone's got a clacks company. Big money. Too rich for my blood. I could've done all right with the Fung Shooey, though. Sheer bloody bad luck there.' </p> <p>'I've certainly felt better with my chair in a different position,' said William. That advice had cost him two dollars, along with an injunction to keep the lid down on the privy so that the Dragon of Unhappiness wouldn't fly up his bottom. </p> <p>'You were my first customer and I thank you,' said Dibbler. 'I was all set up, I'd got the Dibbler wind-chimes and the Dibbler mirrors, it was gravy all the way - I mean, everything was positioned for maximum harmony, and then... smack. Bad karma plops on me once more.' </p> <p>'It was a week before Mr Passmore was able to walk again, though,' said William. The case of Dibbler's second customer had been very useful for his news letter, which rather made up for the two dollars. </p> <p>'I wasn't to know there really is a Dragon of Unhappiness,' said Dibbler. </p> <p>'I don't think there was until you convinced him that one exists,' said William. </p> <p>Dibbler brightened a little. 'Ah, well, say what you like, I've always been good at selling ideas. Can I convince you of the idea that a sausage in a bun is what you desire at this time?' </p> <p>'Actually, I've really got to get this along to-' William began, and then said, 'Did you just hear someone shout?' </p> <p>'I've got some cold pork pies, too, somewhere,' said Dibbler, ferreting in his tray. 'I can give you a convincingly bargain price on\u0097' </p> <p>'I'm sure I heard something,' said William. </p> <p>Dibbler cocked an ear. 'Sort of like a rumbling?' he said. </p> <p>'Yes.' </p> <p>They stared into the slowly rolling clouds that filled Broad Way. </p> <p>Which became, quite suddenly, a huge tarpaulin-covered cart, moving unstoppably and very fast... </p> <p>And the last thing William remembered, before something flew out of the night and smacked him between the eyes, was someone shouting, 'Stop the press!' </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters/story/0,6761,378502,00.html\">Continues</a></p>",
  "The Yugoslav army today indicated its acceptance of the uprising that overthrew Slobodan Milosevic by saying it will act only if its military facilities, personnel and material goods come under direct threat. <p>The Tanjug news agency, which yesterday abandoned its support for the Milosevic regime, said the top army leadership had met early this morning. Citing sources close to the army leadership, it said: \"The Yugoslav army remains consistent to the stands publicly announced several times that it will act within its constitutional powers.\"</p> <p>Today's meeting, a day after opposition supporters took control of the Yugoslav parliament building and state media, is seen as crucial to the outcome of the popular revolt as it appears that the army and security forces have accepted as a fait accompli the end of Mr Milosevic's reign. </p> <p>The army will take comfort from the fact that Vojislav Kostunica, the opposition leader who has been declared president after last month's presidential election, does not accept the jurisdiction of the Hague tribunal on war crimes and is a fervent Serb nationalist.</p> <p>No movements by military units were reported anywhere in the country today. Momcilo Perisic, a former army chief of staff and now an opposition figure, said he had contacted Yugoslavia's military leaders and that they had promised not to intervene. </p> <p>The whereabouts of Mr Milosevic are unclear, but there are reports that he is in a bunker in Beljanica, some 25 miles west of the town of Bor, which is close to the Romanian and Bulgarian borders. </p> <p>The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, arrived in Belgrade today, the first foreign official to arrive in Serbia since yesterday's tumultuous events. He is to meet Mr Kostunica and there were suggestions that he would also meet Mr Milosevic. But Russia, one of Yugoslavia's traditional allies, says the question of asylum for the fallen tyrant is not under consideration.</p> <p>Russia's Interfax news agency quoted the Russian prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, as saying that the question of asylum \"has not been raised and is not being discussed. We are a long way from looking at the question in that way.\"</p> <p>In Belgrade, jubilant crowds roamed the streets early this morning, celebrating the end of 13 years of Mr Milosevic's rule. Fears persist that there could be counterattacks by remnants of the discredited regime. Through the night, tens of thousands danced and sang in celebration of the seizure of Yugoslavia's parliament and other key symbols of the Milosevic regime.</p> <p>All state-owned media were working normally, broadcasting or publishing apologies for their past support for Mr Milosevic. Serb television occasionally flashed its logo during broadcasts, with the slogan: \"This is the new free Serbian television.\" </p> <p>State-owned or formerly pro-Milosevic dailies issued special editions reflecting the change in their editorial policies. Politika featured a front-page photograph of Mr Kostunica, his arm raised triumphantly in the air over a headline: \"Serbia on the road to democracy\" with a subtitle describing him as president. </p> <p>The only voices of dissent in the overwhelmingly positive international reaction to the popular revolt came from Russian officials. The Interfax news agency quoted the head of Russia's communist party, Gennady Zyuganov, as saying he did not approve of events. \"This is not democracy, it smells of marijuana, vodka and dollars,\" he said. </p> <p>Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, welcomed the overthrow of Mr Milosevic, saying that sanctions against Yugoslavia could be lifted on Monday when the European parliament next meets. He added: \"We can then get down to the task of rebuilding.\"</p>",
  "<p>Following the success of my last-but-one cookery book, Eat to Slim (Boxtree, \u00a39.99), and its bestselling follow-up, Eat More and Knock Off Pounds (Boxtree, \u00a314.99), Channel 4 approached me with an idea for a brilliant new TV series, which would offer a radical approach to the whole cookery and dieting thing. </p> <p>Only a fortnight to go, and you'll find it impossible to avoid my TV series, Pig Out and Lose Weight, and its lavishly illustrated tie-in book of the same name. The book's cover - also the logo of the TV series - has yours truly in a mauve leotard and jogging pants, sweating it out on a cycling machine while eating the most gorgeous slice of my own Thick and Creamy Chocolate Cake to Die For. </p> <p>It's all still firmly under wraps, and I know all my lovely friends at Channel 4 will absolutely kill me for this, but just to give you a taster, here's how programme one goes. It opens with me in my leotard on my bike with the cake - cue titles and music - and then there's a great close-up of yours truly licking her lips while Simply the Best! blares out in the background. </p> <p>I then get off my exercise bike and jog around all four sides of the open-plan kitchen, touching each wall in turn, until I get to my fridge. A fridge, I tell the viewer, is the very best place you can think of to perform those vital body-toning exercises that are so necessary for a shapely \"tum\". I then lean against the fridge with my right arm outstretched, slowly moving my left foot through an arc of 180 degrees, then I turn around and do the same thing with the other arm and foot. After a couple of minutes of this exercise, I take a well-earned breather and open the fridge to fetch out all the ingredients for one of my all-time favourite starters: Timbale of Smoked Salmon with a Low Fat Cottage Cheese on a Bed of Lean Bacon Potato Cake with Extra Thick Chocolate-and-Peanut Custard. </p> <p>With all the ingredients laid out before me on my stainless steel work-surface, I tell viewers that this is a brilliant \"bluffer's\" dish that takes only a matter of minutes to prepare - yet is guaranteed to impress even your most standoffish guests! Then, before embarking on the preparation, I remind everyone that the absolute best way to lose weight in the kitchen is to engage in a tightly controlled regime of aerobics while doing all the cooking. For instance, it's easy as pie to perform my stretch-and-stretch/stretch-and-stretch exercises with your knees and lower thighs while preparing the Extra Thick Chocolate-and-Peanut-Custard with your upper body. </p> <p>With the starter all ready and looking simply out-of-this-world, I jog backwards (excellent for slicing pounds off the buttock area, would you believe!) to the fridge and move straight on to the main course - Boudin of Guinea Fowl Stuffed with Veal Sweetbreads with Mussel and Saffron Sauce on a Coulis of Low Fat Blackcurrant Yoghurt. But before I embark on the preparation, I am filmed strapping on my rollerblades, switching my CD to full-blast and then -between the stirring and the pummelling, the slicing and the frying - letting it all hang out and shedding inches off the old waistline by boogying on down to the all-time greatest hits of Macy Gray. </p> <p>To complete the meal, I prepare a simple Butterscotch Mousse with Vanilla Ice-Cream and Low-Fat Cr\u00e8me Fraiche on a tray on the floor while performing 10 old fashioned press-ups. Smashing! And so - with all the hard work completed - I get myself in the mood for my dinner party by slipping into a favourite frock and pouring myself a rewarding glass of champagne, accompanied by some wholemeal taco chips and an amazing marzipan and cream-cheese dip. </p> <p> The lovely thing about the TV programme is that it doesn't just show the food preparation \u00e0 la Delia - it also lets the viewers participate in the dinner party itself (though not literally, obviously: I haven't got a clue who half of them are!). In that first programme, my guests include arts supremo Chris Smith, the inspirational Anita Roddick, the ever vivacious Eve Pollard and top lyricist Tim Rice (who, he tells me, is fighting a losing battle with his waistline!). </p> <p>Talk flowed. As usual, it began with cooking (\"Don't tell anybody - promise!\" said Eve as we dug into our Smoked Salmon Timbales, \"but I've just picked up the most brilliant way of stuffing an artichoke with that marvellous new Tesco's wholemeal blancmange\"), before moving on to dieting (\"I've lost just over three pounds in six weeks on my splendid new break-dancing machine,\" revealed Chris. But I mustn't give too much away. You'll have to watch it for yourselves - and do please mark spring 2002 in your diaries for my follow-up series, Cook that Flab. Enjoy!</p>",
  "After 13 years as unquestioned leader of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic was left with few cards to play last night. Deserted by the people who he put through three wars, he was also deserted by the media machine that faithfully pumped out his propaganda. In the final sudden hours he must have realised that, after the police melted away in the face of the huge crowds outside the parliament building in Belgrade, the army would stay doggedly neutral. The loyalty of his feared paramilitary police was also in question. <p> These last lines of his defence crumbled rapidly last night in the face of people power as the opposition led by Vojislav Kostunica, organised and unified as never before, secured interior and defence ministry guarantees that they would not launch a crackdown on their own people.</p> <p> There were conflicting reports last night about the whereabouts of Mr Milosevic. Unconfirmed reports said that he had left the country by plane, while others indicated he was still in Yugoslavia. </p> <p> An opposition source claimed he was in a bunker near the eastern town of Bor, protected by army troops from the 92nd light infantry brigade. </p> <p> There were no guards outside the ousted president's official residence in Belgrade last night, suggesting he had fled the capital. Mr Kostunica, addressing supporters, said there was no need to go to the house in the luxury suburb of Dedinje. \"He has fled from here,\" he said.</p> <p> A former Milosevic loyalist, army chief of staff, and key figure in the Bosnia war, General Momcilo Perisic, went to the army command to negotiate the military's neutrality against the insurgency.</p> <p> But while the military top brass has been relatively loyal to the regime, the army has been loath to get involved in an internal policing operation. During the past decade the army has consistently been neglected by Mr Milosevic in favour of his well-armed and well-funded praetorian guard, the 120,000-strong interior ministry troops, who were the president's shock troops in the ethnic cleansing of Bosnia and Kosovo.</p> <p> In any case the pace of events on the ground last night in Belgrade was creating its own new reality and it appeared that Mr Milosevic's survival options were increasingly focused on flight abroad.</p> <p> He may well be able to buy himself a safe haven. All through the 90s, his regime has been stripping the assets of the Yugoslav state and salting them abroad - in Cyprus, in Russia, in China and other offshore treasure chests.</p> <p> A sign of panic from the Belgrade regime surfaced in Moscow at the weekend when crony companies of the regime in Russia were ordered to repatriate their assets to Belgrade in apparent preparation for appropriation by the Milosevic clan. Borka Vucic, the septuagenarian head of Serbia's biggest bank, Beobanka, and a kind of godmother to Mr Milosevic, is reported to have made two visits to China in the past two months. The regime is reported to have $200m in Chinese banks.</p> <p> Mrs Vucic is Mr Milosevic's key financier. Mr Milosevic himself headed Beobanka in the early 1980s and Mrs Vucic has been a faithful acolyte for 15 years. She worked in New York and London before becoming boss of Beobanka in Cyprus, the biggest offshore bank on the island, and masterminding the asset stripping of the early 90s which was aimed at counteracting UN sanctions.</p> <p>She has been unfailingly faithful to Mr Milosevic and his orthodox communist wife, Mirjana Markovic, regarding him as a proxy son after losing her own son in a car crash, western bankers said.</p> <p> The favoured boltholes for Mr Milosevic, his wife, his daughter and son are Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and China. Yesterday in Moscow the smart money was on Belarus. </p> <p> The former Soviet foreign minister, Alexander Bessmertnykh, said yesterday that Mrs Markovic could be in Moscow within days, though Mr Milosevic's elder brother Borislav, the Yugoslav ambassador in Moscow and the alleged source of the information, instantly denied it.</p> <p> As a permanent member of the UN security council which voted to set up the Hague war crimes tribunal on former Yugoslavia in 1993, Russia would be in an awkward position were it to afford the Milosevic family asylum. Mr Milosevic faces charges of war crimes in Kosovo and charges relating to crimes in Croatia and Bosnia are being prepared.</p> <p> But that does not mean that the Kremlin may not be organising an alternative shelter for Mr Milosevic. Belarus fits the bill because Moscow has clout there and the authoritarian regime of its president, Alexander Lukashenko, is sympathetic to the Serbian strongman.</p> <p> The American military is monitoring Yugoslav airspace from their base in Bosnia for any unusual air traffic, particularly by the Falcon or DC-10 aircraft favoured by the Milosevic regime.</p> <p> For a decade, ever since Mr Milosevic turned tanks against his own people on the streets of Belgrade in March 1991 and before he launched wars in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, a widespread view has been that the president would go down fighting, not against Croats, Muslims of Bosnia or Kosovans, but against his own people in the country he destroyed. As long ago as 1991, the demonstrators on the streets of Belgrade compared Mr Milosevic with Saddam Hussein and predicted that he and Mirjana would suffer a similar fate to that of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu in neighbouring Romania, who were executed at Christmas 1989.</p> <p> The other widely predicted view was that Mr Milosevic, having destroyed Yugoslavia and turned himself into the biggest menace to European peace since the Nazis, would end it all as Adolf Hitler did in his bunker in 1945 - by killing himself just as his preacher father did in 1962 and his teacher mother did 10 years later.</p>",
  "A political party exists to govern. That's what parties are for. They're not for clog-dancing, flag-waving, or even for debating the finer points of education policy. Yet nine times, yesterday, William Hague felt obliged to remind us that the Conservative party was ready to govern. What a discovery! Never has a leader protested so often that his entire purpose in life is, actually, within his capacity. The more resonantly he repeated it, the more it dawned that this might be exactly the thing he wasn't ready for. <p>This was a performance of extraordinary emptiness. Here was not a government-in-waiting but an opposition that has yet to develop a constructive view of the world it might inherit. The entire thrust of Mr Hague's pre-governmental speech was negative. It depended for all its best lines on Labour's iniquity and for all its political energy on the trite proposition that disillusioned voters will prefer anything to the present lot. </p> <p>It was plainly trying to connect with the generalised sense of discontent that burst out of last month's fuel crisis and became the pretext for the Tories' advance in the polls. But because Mr Hague misunderstands the nature of this public cynicism, he failed to address the true anxieties underlying it. He placed a heavy bet on total disillusionment - as if this absolved him from getting to grips with any deeper reality, beginning with his own inability to strike a chord with a congregation beyond the home church. </p> <p>His critique did chime, at a certain level, with the public mood. There have been a lot of Labour failures. People look at the health service and wonder whether they would ever get a hospital bed. They were appalled by Mr Blair's inability to keep the petrol tankers running. The Greenwich dome is no longer even worth a sick joke. Three-and-a-half years is a long enough period for the blame for many things to be switched from the Thatcher-Major years to the Blair record. </p> <p>It is also fair enough to rail against the cronyism of New Labour, and light a fire under the elitist bistros of Islington. The Blair style has had arrogance pinned on it, but the more credible reproach is that it is out of touch. Laying claim to the real heart of old England, though Wales and Scotland were not mentioned, is standard stuff for an opposition leader. </p> <p>But people are not that stupid. Mr Hague spoke like someone who thought public cynicism derived from fury with Labour, failing to see that the problem is not rage but caustic indifference. They didn't have especially high hopes of Labour. A lot more than Mr Hague's ranting will be needed to persuade them that he would be much different. </p> <p>When he allowed us some relief from his anti-Blair hyperbole, and his insecurity about being fit for government, he ran over the thin policy pickings: lower fuel taxes, \"free\" schools, tax relief for private health insurance, jail for asylum seekers. But the general thrust was insulting in its lack of specifics. Though the speech had a certain hard-line coherence - nothing here for inclusive softies - it treated his wider audience with intellectual effrontery. </p> <p>Mr Hague expects the voters to be satisfied with the mere assertion of a better way, rather than its depiction. He devoted not a single line to expounding a credible position on tax-and-spend or how he would satisfy the taxpayer's revolt without provoking the service-user's revenge. This, after all, is the domestic issue that most explicitly divides Labour from the Conservatives, as well as the one that has thrown the darkest doubt on the Hague-Portillo team's fitness for government. </p> <p>As had been the case throughout the week, any gaps in the sums were filled by that weariest of promises, broken by every government: a war on bureaucracy and red tape. </p> <p>For people in the Tory party, and those already committed to voting Conservative next time, this speech was probably warming. It did something to retrieve the leader from the giggling pits he was allowed to plumb in Channel 4's ultra-soft focus film, designed to set him up as a human being before the conference. He obviously is a human being, humorous and self-aware: so self-aware that he sometimes seems like a man who has read every textbook on political performance. Technically, his delivery yesterday was masterly. He can stamp out a punch-line as well as anyone in politics. </p> <p>The core vote will also be delighted with his defence of section 28, his promise to put more criminals in the stocks than anyone since Judge Jeffreys, his heavy shouting about the independence of Britain. From this audience nothing got deeper-throated applause than Mr Hague's unqualified representation of Europe as a threat to British identity. If Mrs Thatcher had uttered this kind of stuff in the 1980s, she'd have been carted off by a disbelieving party long before 1990. Now it comes naturally from a man whose claim, repeated over and over again in that mantra of self-doubt, is that he will govern for all the people. </p> <p>But that is the problem. What will the floater make of him? What, even, of those natural and former Tories who say they cannot stand Mr Blair, but are also quite settled in their view that they could never vote for a party led by William Hague? </p> <p>He said he was reaching out. He spoke some words about being inclusive. The party appropriated for itself the One Nation slogan. But Mr Hague could not see any conflict, even any disagreement, between what people have historically understood by the One Nation philosophy and what people now understand by opportunistic populism. </p> <p>He seems to imagine that all the world are natural Hagueites, beating with the heart of England, awaiting only him to speak for them. Just as he supposes the whole of England shares his neurotic anxieties for Britain's inviolable nationhood. There are many sceptics, and he had nothing to say to them. He preached to the converted as if there was nobody left to persuade. He seems a long way from understanding the country he so anxiously insists he is ready to govern.</p>",
  "William Hague yesterday sacrificed a ritual Conservative conference triumph with a speech which reached out beyond the Tory heartlands in an attempt to woo disaffected blue collar Labour voters. <p>Seven months before the expected May election, the Tory leader used his 49-minute address in Bournemouth to tell floating voters that the Conservatives had learned from past mistakes and want to govern pragmatically \"for all the people\". </p> <p>He was firm on the need for tax cuts, but promised better health care and schools, inner city revival and pension rises, all services on which Labour is finally spending billions. </p> <p>The speech was strong in its populist tone - \"no government in recent times has been as tough on criminals as we will be\" - but conspicuously short on specific policies. </p> <p>Labour was quick to complain that the sums did not add up, and that \u00a316bn worth of cuts would follow a Tory victory. It was another key election issue to which Mr Hague made virtually no mention. </p> <p>Instead he mocked senior ministers and abused Tony Blair as an actor without principles \"who is prepared to say whatever will please his audience without the slightest consistent thought or principle entering his head\". </p> <p>What was immediately noticeable was that Mr Hague's oratory did not work its usual magic with the activists in the hall. His speech was punctuated by desultory applause, except during pledges to protect Britain's independence - and the pound - from the EU. </p> <p>So confident was he that his three year \"common sense revolution\" has reconnected the Tories with what he repeatedly called \"the mainstream majority\", the ordinary voters Labour has allegedly ignored, that he challenged Mr Blair to an immediate election. \"Go on Tony, call it now,\" he said. </p> <p>The volatile state of public opinion, which has seen Labour first lose, then regain an eight-point poll lead in the past month, makes it unlikely that Mr Hague wants his bluff called, especially after this week's mixed messages on social tolerance which pitted Ann Widdecombe against Michael Portillo yesterday. </p> <p>In a contrite tone which echoed Mr Blair's acknowledgement that voters are alienated by politicians, he said: \"I don't think we'll solve every problem, avoid every mistake... I just want to govern with the common sense instincts of the people.\" </p> <p>His assessment of those instincts was a blend of familiar rightwing nostrums on Europe, crime, asylum, tax and wasted public spending, and new efforts to persuade people that he understands the fears and aspirations of those who live on sink estates and struggle to pay their way. \"I'm in it for you,\" he kept saying. </p> <p>Given the mixed signals which some shadow ministers have delivered, Mr Hague said: \"There are some who say there is a contradiction between traditional Conservative issues and winning new Tory audiences; between tolerance and championing the mainstream values of the country. There is no contradiction. Being tough on crime, believing in lower taxes and the robust defence of our nation's independence are not in contradiction with wanting better schools and hospitals, and thriving inner cities. They are an essential part of achieving those things.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sir Richard Branson's People's Lottery yesterday accused its rival Camelot of \"hounding\" the national lottery commission chair Dame Helena Shovelton out of office. </p> <p>Simon Burridge, chief executive of the People's Lottery, accused Camelot of trying to derail the process of choosing which company would win the next licence to operate the game. In what has become an increasingly acrimonious affair, he described the behaviour of Camelot as outrageous. </p> <p>\"I feel they have hounded her out,\" he said. \"They talk about her delivering 'gross insults' but they called her a liar and have been waging a campaign to get her removed. </p> <p>\"This is a reasonably obvious strategy. They are trying to get new commissioners and a new bidding process. That's the only slim chance they have. Camelot have been taking this moral high ground but actually it's precisely their lack of morality that has got them into this situation in the first place.\" </p> <p>Dame Helena resigned late on Wednesday night after a tumultuous few weeks citing her \"personal villification\" in the media. She is being replaced temporarily by Harriet Spicer, who helped launch the feminist publisher Virago Press. </p> <p>Camelot chief executive designate Dianne Thompson said she was not satisfied that the commission would act fairly in awarding the next licence. It was her furious response to a letter from the commission that finally triggered Dame Helena's resignation. </p> <p>Camelot was angered by a decision in August made by the commission to negotiate excusively with the People's Lottery despite having reservations over both bids. </p> <p>Ms Thompson said: \"Dame Helena's resignation is a step in the right direction because it shows they are now taking this seriously. We are not seeking the resignation of the others but the decision taken in August was taken unanimously and we want them to reassure us that we will be treated fairly.\" </p> <p>She said the delays which have caused fears that charities could lose funding were the commission's fault. </p> <p>Camelot wants a public statement from the commission admitting culpability for the chaos surrounding the bid and to retract comments that the People's Lottery would deliver more for good causes. </p> <p>It also wants the evaluation of the two lottery bids to be made public. </p> <p>Ms Thompson said further legal action was still likely if the assurances aren't given. </p> <p>Ms Spicer, 49, who has taken on the task of picking a winner, has the type of CV which makes for early self-confidence - Benenden school and St Anne's College, Oxford. </p> <p>On leaving university she had a brief dalliance promoting ice cream before being rescued by a friend at the publisher Quartet who knew that Carmen Callil needed a secretary. Ms Spicer quickly became co-director and business manager and was made managing director in 1992.</p>",
  "As convoys of opposition vehicles converged on Belgrade yesterday, a shockwave of protests spread across the countryside. Hesitant riot police stood by, or were swept aside by the popular uprising. <p>In the northern town of Subotica, near the Hungarian border, the arrest of a student activist triggered a rally of 10,000 people in the town square. In the third largest city, Nis, a similar sized demonstration tried to force its way into the local offices of President Milosevic's Socialist party but was persuaded by opposition leaders not to give police a reason to attack them. Water cannon vehicles remained parked. </p> <p>Attempts to block the roads leading to the capital were easily thwarted. Where the police had set up roadblocks they were overwhelmed by the numbers pressing forward. A procession of vehicles carrying 2,000 people was briefly stopped near the town of Smederevska Palanka, 30 miles south of Belgrade, but eventually pushed its way through barricades. </p> <p>Protesters used an excavator to shove aside two lorries laden with sand and parked across the main road from the opposition-held town of Cacak to Belgrade. Police in riot gear did not intervene as a 12-mile-long column of cars and buses, with opposition and Serbian flags fluttering from the windows, ferried 15,000 people into the capital. </p> <p>At other roadblocks, lorries were pushed off the highway while demonstrators negotiated with police commanders to be allowed through. At one blockade, protesters overturned a police car into a ditch. Several thousand people were marching on foot towards Belgrade from the industrial city of Pancevo, six miles to the north. </p> <p>There were more defections to the opposition from the state-controlled media. The Dnevnik newspaper in northern Serbia carried reports on opposition activities and the wave of strikes and blockades. At the strikebound coal mine in Kolubara, where police first gave ground to the crush of opposition demonstrators on Wednesday night, the occupation by miners continued in defiance of the police who had taken over part of the complex in an attempt to prevent widespread power cuts. </p> <p>The strike committee in Kolubara decided to stay put rather than join in the march to Belgrade. \"We are not afraid, we have to keep up,\" a member, Zoran Cvetanovic, said. \"We want to keep our workers in the pits - we do not want them to go to Belgrade because we must persist in our demands and defend ourselves.\" </p> <p>Another strike leader said: \"There should be no confrontation with [the police]. If they know how to make the machines work, then they can make them work. We won't work until the true results of the presidential elections are recognised. Until Vojislav Kostunica is president.\" </p> <p>An opposition leader declared: \"We found the fire in Kolubara, this dynamite that has activated people all around Serbia.\" </p> <p>The 7,500 strikers at Kolubara understood what was at stake. \"I'm not afraid of the police. There's no reason to be afraid,\" said Miljana Ljuba, a 36-year-old who spent 17 years working the pits in a region that until last week solidly supported Mr Milosevic. \"The police are people, just like us. We are fighting for justice.\" </p> <p>\"We are not interested in bloodshed,\" said Milos Maksimovic, 35. \"Milosevic had enough in Bosnia and Croatia. I respect Mr Milosevic. In the past I voted for him. But now we need another man. The opposition is careful - and there will be no bloodshed.\" </p> <p>Under a moonlit night in the wasteland of the massive strip mine, Mr Milosevic's political game of 13 years finally looked to be up. Some strikers even shared a cigarette with police. </p> <p>The machines that dig the coal for the electricity-generating plant were still. The police lurked around the perimeters of the mine like ghosts of the force Mr Milosevic once used to suppress dissent. The miners had simply downed their tools. </p> <p>Ljubisa Petrovic, pensive with slate grey eyes and stubbled beard, worked in the eastern field, one of many mining strips in the complex. </p> <p>\"They called us from D field. They said they had stopped production and decided to strike,\" he said. \"Then everyone who was working stopped working in my field. We just want a confirmation of the opposition win. We know that the votes Milosevic claims were stolen.\" </p> <p>In Serbia's junior federal partner, Montenegro, the presidential adviser Miodrag Vukovic warned: \"Milosevic is still alive politically. He is more dangerous than ever.\" Against a background of fast-moving events, Mr Vukovic also suggested that Montenegro's union with Serbia was essentially dead. </p> <p>\"There is definitely no Yugoslavia,\" he said. \"In Montenegro everything is working perfectly, while Serbia is coming to a standstill. If Yugoslavia still existed we would probably be having anti-Milosevic demonstrations here, but we are not.\" </p> <p>Mr Vukovic said fears Mr Milosevic would stage a coup in this tiny coastal republic to divert attention from the election chaos in Serbia had subsided. \"We are past the worst. The soldiers are now back in their barracks.\" </p> <p>He added that if Mr Kostunica managed to wrest power from Mr Milosevic and wanted to be taken seriously as a democrat, he would need to overhaul all federal institutions and call new parliamentary elections. He said talks would be needed to establish a new union between Serbia and Montenegro. </p> <p>\"This entity need not be called Yugoslavia,\" he said. \"Montenegro is already independent economically and politically.\"</p>",
  "For the grand finale, which way would William Hague go? To zero tolerance or caring (but not sharing) conservatism? A dilemma since both soft Portillo and tough Widdecombe drew the audience to their Zimmer frames - none so far finding that crystal definition. But nor did Hague with his \"Governing for all the people.\" <p>The floor was already littered with the week's startling images. Squiffy good, spliffy bad. Fourteen pints makes a man, but a joint puts you in the slammer. No more short breaks to Amsterdam - a positive blood test at immigration within 10 days risks a \u00a3100 airport tax. Two and a half thousand more crazed cannabis smokers in jug, alongside the 78,000 asylum seekers to be locked up. Tally-ho for the party in favour of hunting burglars! But nothing, absolutely nothing to explain how they were going to spend more and tax less. </p> <p>So away sail the Tories to never-never land, where Peter Pan Hague is eclipsed by the two big beasts fighting for his crown. Widdecombe Hook's law-and-order idyll wrestles with crocodile Portillo's penitential tears. The great culture war for the prow of the Marie Celeste is set to become Westminster's best pantomime. Michael wrings his hands and uses \"I\" and \"me\" 50 times in his grand audition, Ann stamps up and down proclaiming there's no such thing as \"social tolerance\". At last the fun is back in fundamentalism. </p> <p>It's unlikely Mr Portillo has changed his scales. He may have taken a course in modernism, learning that the personal is political. Never mind the policy, feel my feelings. \"I\", \"me\", \"my\" politics is clammily involving, hot-breath intimate and above all confessional. Coming out as gay with an asylum-seeking father - what worse could a man own up to in that fearsome Bournemouth hall? A few sessions of hospital portering, touring Spain to rediscover his roots, searching his soul for the humility, truth and light that come after a great fall - here is heroic material for the making of a modern myth. (Did Max Clifford ever offer any advice?) It was a bravura performance. </p> <p>But pause a moment to consider his versatility. Remember his last great theatrical conference role, where he used his defence brief for tub-thumping, intolerant Europhobia: \"Britain is blessed with very brave soldiers, sailors and airmen, willing to give their lives - for Britain, not for Brussels. The European Commission might want to harmonise uniforms and cap badges, or even to metricate them. The European Court would probably want to stop our men fighting for more than 40 hours a week. They would probably have sent half of them home on paternity leave!\" And the finishing war cry: \"Around the world three letters send a chill down the spine of the enemy - SAS. And those letters spell out one clear message: don't mess with Britain. The SAS has a famous motto: Who Dares Wins. We will dare, we will win!\" From Rambo in 1996 to Cliff Richard in 2000 - another year, another end-of-the-pier show. </p> <p>So which way should William Hague turn? Towards Widdecombe's social whips and chains, old Portillo's union flag or new Portillo's I-feel-your-pain? Easy. Hague took it all in. But it was a remarkable dinosaur of a speech, a classic hour of political emptiness that would have any ordinary audience groaning in agony. Riffs of vacuous verbiage wove worn-out airy phrases in and out and back again to nowhere. \"Making the most of being British\", \"I'm in it for you ... for the real people of this country ... who look to the Tories to give them back their country ... for all the people ... decent law-abiding families, hardworking families, with common sense values\", over and over again, excruciating nothingness. Even his debating-society wit would have made a schoolboy wince: \"Less PC and more PCs!\" </p> <p>Where in all this was the substance? More BSE than beef. And yet the dim outline of the coming election lurked within the leaden clouds. First law and order - \"No government has ever been as tough on law and order as we will be.\" Then the real battleground: \"No government has ever been as committed to cutting taxes as we will be.\" This is the crunch, the nugget in the dross. \"Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy\" (a George W Bush line). Yet how will it be done? All week they have billowed out an extraordinary list of spending promises. </p> <p> Shadow chancellor Michael Portillo seems to have been too busy practicing his lines in the mirror to rein in the profligacy of his comrades who have spent recklessly whenever they opened their mouths. More on pensions, whatever Labour offers. As much on schools and hospitals whatever Labour spends, unimaginable sums on locking in asylum seekers. A fortune on more police and yet more prison, stopping what Hague called \"prisoners idling in their cells\". Undisclosed sums knocking down tower blocks, petrol tax cut, more money for farmers and hauliers. (Hague did a good I-feel-your-pain about a hardworking trucker far from home.) </p> <p>Where will it all come from? Three throwaway lines suggest a kind of answer. First there was a glancing reference to Gordon Brown's \"surplus millions\", money the Treasury denies exists unless the Tories plan to spend recklessly like Lawson and Lamont did in the good times, only to bust in the next down-turn. Then there was \"cutting fraud\", that old stand-by of phoney economics. Last and horribly plausible was the source that got just one brief sentence, a pledge to cut \"worthless government schemes\". That can only mean one thing, a slash and burn of all the programmes now rolling out, the ones that rarely catch the headlines. </p> <p>No more to Sure Start for the poorest children, no more counsellors and clinics to cut teenage pregnancy, advisers to help the over-50s and single mothers back to work, the million new nursery, child care, after-school and homework club places - plus all the myriad other \"worthless schemes\" unrolling as yet too slowly to have earned public understanding and support. There are indeed billions to be slashed out there with few but the poor to notice their passing. </p> <p>What can Labour learn from watching the Tories? Plenty. What matters is substance, there is nothing else. Less phrase-making, more intellectual rigour. Talk about hard practical things, admit failures, discuss problems, treat voters like grown-ups not like idiots. Let the next manifesto and annual report be nothing but Gradgrind fact, own up to disappointment, never over-promise, never over-claim. Modesty in success, honesty in failure. Above all no cheap tricks. The terrible leaked Gould memo did killer damage to Tony Blair's integrity. Never again louts-to-cash-point law-and-order lollipops: they convince no one. Leave tawdry opportunism to the enemy. Rein in Jack Straw; rise above, don't outbid Widdecombe. Leave emoting to Portillo. The public is canny, its cynicism often justified. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Potential jurors in the first trial arising from the biggest corruption scandal in the history of the Los Angeles police were told yesterday that an officer murdered two people and buried their bodies in a rubbish dump in Tijuana. <p>But the \"police monster\" who allegedly killed a young man and his mother because they did not come up with the drug money he demanded is not in the dock; he is the chief prosecution witness, former police officer Rafael Perez.</p> <p>The suggestion that Perez, a corrupt officer who turned informer to escape a long sentence for stealing cocaine from a police locker, is also a murderer is the latest twist in a saga that has transfixed the city and seriously damaged police morale.</p> <p>The trial of four police officers accused of corruption, which started this week, is the first opportunity for the full story of police shootings, drug dealing, bribery and planting of evidence to be told in court.</p> <p>Perez's former girlfriend Sonia Flores claims that he has not told the whole story of his wrongdoing, although he has openly admitted taking part in the shooting of a gang member and planting drugs and weapons on criminals.</p> <p>She says that she was present when Perez and another officer, David Mack, tried to extract money from the young man and his mother in central Los Angeles.</p> <p>When the money was not forthcoming, Perez and Mack, who is serving a jail sentence for bank robbery, shot them, Ms Flores claims.</p> <p>They allegedly wrapped the bodies in carpet and drove them south of the border where a corrupt Mexican officer helped to dump them in a tip.</p> <p>A rubbish tip on a hillside outside Tijuana is due to be searched.

  "The landscape of Argentina's sub-tropical northern state, Corrientes - the Iber\u00e1 - became the source of the visionary poetry of Francisco Madariaga, who has died aged 73. <p>He lived between noisy, booming Buenos Aires and a hut some 15km from Santa Rosa in Corrientes. All his poetry, with its flashes of tropical intensities, was written from that very urban city to ward off anguish. </p> <p>Though born in the capital, Madariaga moved early to a Corrientes village, only returning to Buenos Aires when he was 15. Corrientes is Argentina's Mesopotamia; it lies between two vast rivers, the Paran\u00e1 and the Uruguay, is dotted with shallow lakes, swamps, dunes and palm trees, and is populated by alligators, wild horses and snakes. It remains wild and backwards even today, with a history of violence and lawlessness, \"a lush anachronism of colours and smells\". </p> <p>When I first met Madariaga in 1970, he offered me some cigars he had made, and invited me to visit him in the wilds. A reticent man, he spoke Spanish with a sing-song, and learnt Guarani, the regional Indian language, perfectly, sprinkling his poems with the odd Guarani words, while citing Rimbaud, DH Lawrence and H\u00f6lderlin. He blended peasant and sophisticate, linking him with writers of the American hinterlands, like Mexico's Juan Rulfo and Brazil's Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa. </p> <p>Madariaga once awkwardly identified himself in a poem as \"beduin-gauchi-afro-hispano-guaran\u00ed\" (Bedouin-Gaucho-Afro-Hispanic-Guarani). Tall, skinny and striking, with a delightful laugh, he refused to join respectable Buenos Aires literary life. On another time when we met, in 1977, he was a night porter. This deliberately marginal stance was reflected in his devotion to a kind of poetry that could be loosely described as ethically surrealist, in that he never betrayed his poetic values, nor watered down his work for easy reading. </p> <p>He began publishing poems in 1943; his first collection, El peque\u00f1o pat\u00edbulo (Small Gallows), appeared in 1954, by which time his staccato and aphoristic constants were already evident. He followed this in 1960 with Las jaulas del sol (The Cages Of Sun), and in 1963 came El delito natal (Birth Crime). In 1973, there was, among others, Tembladerales de oro (Golden Quagmires), and he collected all his poems in El tren casi fluvial (The Almost Fluvial Train), which was published in Mexico and Argentina in 1987. His last book, in 1998, was Aroma de apariciones, (Aroma Of Appearances). </p> <p>Although he published continuously, Madariaga's total output was small, and exclusively poetic. He never col lected the chronicles of his travels, by canoe and horseback, around his beloved backlands. On a postcard to me, he once described his work as \"travel notes from canoes, trains and horses\". </p> <p>As well as celebrating the inaccessible Corrientes landscape, Madariaga evoked the way intense sensations - light, touch, smells, images - could be trapped in words without betraying them, a kind of sensual candour or erotic emotionalism. His short poem The Wood, translated by Anthony Edkins, captures this visionary energy: </p> <p> A pot <br>boiling blood <br>in winter. <br>Region where <br>red fire-drinking <br>whores urinate. </p> <p>Madariaga was a singer of love and women, and was anti-intellectual - or \"anti-verbal\", as he wrote in a poem. For him, the shock of direct experience with the world, when it matched his passionate imagination (or vice-versa), could not be analysed or controlled. </p> <p>His 1954 poem, The True Land, opens with a question: \"Is happiness elsewhere?\" and closes with a mandate: </p> <p> Virtuous drinker of the diamond's water, lie down <br> and rage at the giant globe of the idea. <br>This blood-drum is your land. </p> <p>Madariaga adapted surrealism to his own purposes, but did join forces with poets Enrique Molina and Aldo Pellegrini in 1952 to found a surrealist cell, with a magazine, A partir de cero (Starting from Zero), which denounced the philistine, neo-fascist, cultural policies of the then ruling Peronists and the cosmopolitan nostalgia of writers grouped around Victoria Ocampo's magazine, Sur. It was a dotty, and stimulating assault on good taste. </p> <p>He was a close friend of the wealthy avant-garde poet Oliverio Girondo, and his writer wife Norah Lange and their circle, and later promoted and protected countless younger poets and painters. Though he remained apolitical, he was admirably honest and eccentric. </p> <p>By the late 1970s, Madariaga's poetry was officially recognised, was sung by folksinger Teresa Parodi, won prizes, and became included in most anthologies of Latin American poetry. In 1996, his work was chosen to launch the collection of outstanding Argentine poets published by the state-funded Fondo Nacional de las Artes. </p> <p>He was twice married, with two children from his first wife, and a son with Elida Manselli, his second wife, also a poet. </p> <p>\u0095 Francisco Madariaga, poet, born September 9 1927; died September 24 2000</p>",
  "The Tooting Granada in south London yesterday became the first Grade I listed cinema. Its interior was summarised despairingly by cinema historian Richard Gray as \"chunks of every European cathedral you've ever heard of with a bit of Moorish Chinese Venetian Shakespearean thrown in for good measure.\" <p>Other English cinemas were listed for the first time or upgraded after a year long hunt to find the lost treasures of the golden ages of cinema building, between the wars and just before the first world war. </p> <p>Despite the enormous recent rise in the popularity of cinemas, there are now an estimated 551 in England compared to 4,036 in 1946. </p> <p>The appeal for nominations brought more than 450 suggestions to English Heritage, the government's conservation adviser. Some listings are just in time to save buildings which are now empty and decaying, or in use as warehouses and stores. </p> <p>The 32 cinemas listed yesterday included some of the earliest, with the Electric Palace in Harwich, built in 1911, upgraded to Grade II*. The 1910 Picturedome in East Finchley, and the 1912 Empress Road, Manchester, now a paint store, were also listed. The grandest, the Tooting Granada, was built in 1931. The arts minister Alan Howarth yesterday took in its vast auditorium, with its cliff faces of Gothic tracery, medieval frescoes, stained glass, heraldic lions, griffins playing harps and foxes with trumpets, all under a Venetian coffered ceiling and said the picture palaces were part of everyone's heritage. </p> <p>The cinema was built for Sidney Bernstein, who called his chain Granada in memory of a Spanish holiday, and insisted \"people want architecture with marble columns, gilt and mirrors.\" His exotic interior designer, Theodore Komisarjevsky, a refugee White Russian prince, gave him all of those in spades. </p> <p>\"He really didn't know the meaning of the word excess,\" said Elain Harwood, English Heritage's expert on 20th century architecture.</p>",
  "For the first time since the second world war the far right is on the march in Norway, and real power is within its grasp. <p>According to opinion polls, the extreme right, anti-immigration, Progress party has outstripped the ruling Labour party to become the most popular political force with this affluent country's 4.5m people.</p> <p>Its approval rating has soared as high as 35% and its charismatic leader, Carl Hagen - or \"King Carl\" - is being touted as the next prime minister.</p> <p>With less than a year to go before parliamentary elections are held, alarm bells are ringing and Norway's reputation as a tolerant society is under threat.</p> <p>The Progress party has won support by promising all things to all voters, and by promising to cut taxes and spend more of the country's oil revenue on improving the welfare state. It also wants to bundle the elderly off to Spain, where health care is cheaper.</p> <p>As the party has become more popular, Mr Hagen has done his best to rein in some of its more outspoken members and play down its hardline immigration policies.</p> <p>But his most radical ideas are unchanged. The party's manifesto advocates abolishing development aid to the third world because, it says, the money is spent on \"arms and luxury goods\" for the elite. Poverty, it argues, is a result of poor countries' inability to organise themselves.</p> <p>Norway already operates a restrictive immigration policy but Mr Hagen would go further. A maximum of 1,000 immigrants a year would be allowed, and asylum seekers who broke Norwegian law would be repatriated.</p> <p>The party also wants a national referendum on whether any more foreigners at all should be admitted - Norway has about 250,000 - and it is keen to test new arrivals for Aids.</p> <p>The party is compared by some to Austria's far-right Freedom party and France's National Front, but it insists that it is not racist.</p> <p>\"We're a new political breed,\" says the silver-haired, rather portly, Mr Hagen, sitting in his smart office in the parliament building in Oslo.</p> <p>\"We combine the best from social democratic thinking and the best from conservative thinking.\"</p> <p>Norwegian society is under attack, he warns, and too many immigrants will spark social unrest.</p> <p>\"Let's not be naive and blue-eyed. If you have too many immigrants you will get social conflict. You can like it or dislike it, but that's a fact.\"</p> <p>And, he says, the problems have already begun, especially in eastern Oslo, known as Lit tle Karachi because it has so many Pakistanis.</p> <p>\"We have knives in schools, which we never had before, and we have gangs shooting at each other.\"</p> <p>Asked if ordinary Norwegians feel as he does about newcomers, Mr Hagen is categorical. \"Opinion polls for the last 10 years have shown that they agree with me.\"</p> <p>Akhenaton de Leon, director of the Institution Against Public Discrimination, agrees that hostility against immigrants is widespread and says the rise of the Progress party is a symptom of this. \"We have problems in paradise. Police harassment is rampant in this country, and racial discrimination in the housing and labour markets is widespread.\"</p> <p>He says he has seen intolerance increase in the past few years. Clients have told housing agencies to let property to whites only, even the most menial jobs require unreasonably high language skills, and black people often find it difficult to get into to nightclubs and restaurants.</p> <p>\"Mr Hagen is a clever populist who is dangerous for society,\" Mr De Leon says. \"If he enters into a coalition with the Conservative party it would be a disaster for the integration process in this country.\"</p>",
  "<p>Archaeologists yesterday offered a snapshot of life as it was lived 30,000 years ago, when the Midlands were a steppe in the middle of the ice age. </p> <p>Their discovery of a hunters' temporary camp in Rutland, reported by English Heritage yesterday, offers a rare, possibly unique insight, since at the time there were perhaps only a thousand people living in the whole of what is now England. </p> <p>Archaeologists from Leicester University stumbled across the signs of ancient habitation in Glaston, near Oakham, during a medieval dig. They found a flint arrowhead typical of the upper stone age, together with part-worked flints and loose chippings. Alongside them were gnawed bones from a den of hyenas. </p> <p>\"This site is incredibly important as a look at what life was like on the steppe in eastern England at that time,\" said Andy Currant of the Natural History Museum, in London. More remains may yet be found, as the archaeologists have been given an extension until the end of the month, when work begins on building houses. </p> <p>The human nomads who used the camp were returning after an absence of 70,000 years, when the cold had been too severe for them and their favourite prey, the wild horse. Rutland then was steppe, similar to present day southern Siberia, with rolling grassland and dry, bitterly cold winters. Woolly rhinos, mammoths and elk roamed in huge numbers, with man a lonely hunter. </p> <p>\"You must perceive the rarity of this creature, man, among the rest,\" said Simon Colcutt, of Oxford University. \"A human in this environment required [the wildlife of] at least 200 sq kilometres to live off. If you had a viable group of 30 or so, you wouldn't have much of Britain left.\" </p> <p>Exhaustive tests will be done on the remains to find out how the presence of man - or, possibly, his hominid rival, the Neanderthal - fitted in with the hyenas' lair.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Day 1: meeting the press</strong> <br></p> <p> It is three years since I last saw Terence Davies. His mother had just died, and he was in despair, and he'd tell anyone who stopped long enough to ask how he was. He couldn't see the point of going on. Actually, he looked as if he'd already given up. </p> <p>So it's hard to recognise the man lapping up the limelight on stage at New York's Lincoln Center. Physically he looks the same - the campest accountant you'll ever meet. It's his demeanour that has changed. An American journalist in the post-screening audience says: \"Meeting you here, you seem like the life of the party. Why don't you do an Ealing-style movie next time?\" Davies, who has made two of the most miserable and beautiful films in cinema history, licks his lips. \"I'd love to,\" he says, \"but having a good sense of humour isn't the same as being able to write comedy.\" This most English of Englishmen is revelling in the cerebral glitz of Manhattan. </p> <p>It's 12 years since Davies came to prominence with Distant Voices, Still Lives. The film was autobiographical, documenting the love with which his mother and nine siblings survived his father's brutality. As with all Davies's films, the images haunt you for ever, notably the father, played by Pete Postlethwaite, ripping away the tablecloth, and Christmas dinner with it - a silent, terrifying assault. </p> <p>Distant Voices, Still Lives was the second instalment of Davies's Liverpool life. The first, his rarely shown Trilogy, is made up of three short movies and is equally brilliant, equally unbearable. The Trilogy shows the young man trying, and failing, to come to terms with his homosexuality. Again, the images glue themselves to mind and soul - the solitary woman on the bus who breaks down and cries till there's nothing left; the father, played by Wilfrid \"Steptoe\" Brambell, coughing himself to death in a wordless scene that seems to last for ever. With these films Davies quietly reinvented cinema. The camera barely moved, the actors barely acted - they were more like living photographs than movies. </p> <p>After a six-year absence Davies is back with his fifth film, an adaptation of Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth, and the New York journalists are stunned by what they have just seen. Yes, this period piece is a conventional film - a radical departure for Davies - but it is a savage take on New York society in the early 20th century. </p> <p>It's a perfect film for a New York audience - after all, it is set in the city, though it was actually shot in Glasgow because it was so much cheaper. But it's still astonishing to find Davies here, feted wherever he goes. It was surprising enough when the abused child grew into a man who managed to hold down a job for so many years; even more surprising when he gave it all up to make his art-house movies. Now here he is, unable to move for Oscar talk, explaining how he turned Gillian Anderson, one of today's biggest television stars, into a formidable film actor. He may resist the idea, but, as he tells the world's press why he adapted Wharton's novel and they hang on his every word, he's on the cusp of the big time. </p> <p>\"What is extraordinary about the book is its modernity,\" he says. \"It's about the destruction of one person by a social class, it's about how much money you've got, what you look like - and what is modern society about if not how much money you've got and what you look like?\" </p> <p>When Lily Bart, the heroine played by Anderson, refuses to marry for money and fails to salvage her reputation by ruining that of the man she loves, she is destroyed. </p> <p>He is asked why he chose Anderson. Davies looks a little sheepish as he embarks on a typical story. \"When I cast her I hadn't seen The X Files and still haven't because I don't watch television except for the news and some documentaries. I was looking for faces that looked like the Singer Sargent portraits of the belle \u00e9poque , and I said, 'That is a John Singer Sargent face, who is she?'\" Davies invited her over for a pot of tea, as he does, and it turned out that the American celebrity knew all about the obscure British film-maker. \"Apparently, she was a fan. She told me she had seen The Long Day Closes and had cried at the tracking shot over the carpet.\" </p> <p>In The Long Day Closes, Davies's father finally dies, he discovers movies, the family discovers peace, and for four years he embraces life ecstatically. Davies's tracking shot is perhaps his most distinctive trait: the camera languorously glides over a carpet, a cinema audience, the Atlantic ocean. The technique is self-indulgent, audacious and gorgeous. </p> <p>The great worry about Terence Davies - one of the great worries about him - was that once he had exhausted his family life, there would be nothing left. He says he knew he had to escape his own history. Technically, he did this with his last film, The Neon Bible, but even here the boy with his tender misery was little more than an American version of young Terry. </p> <p>\"When you mine your own seam, you also destroy it,\" he says. \"There's a point where you become repetitive - there's nothing else to say. My great love is Eliot's Four Quartets and these were my modest version of the Four Quartets, based on the suffering of myself and my own family.\" </p> <p> <strong> Day 2: on the road</strong> <br></p> <p> We're in a yellow cab on the way to a radio interview. Davies and his PR, Mark, are trying to outcamp each other. Mark stares at a huge billboard advert for Tommy Hilfiger - a male model in nothing but his six-pack and underpants. \"It's very popular, that advert in New York,\" Mark says. \"I bet it is! I can imagine,\" Davies answers. </p> <p>Mark tells him The House of Mirth has just been reviewed in Newsweek - three and a half stars. \"Is that good?\" Davies asks. \"Three and a half out of four. We're doing OK.\" </p> <p>Davies disappears into a tiny booth. He's talking about modernity again, the way that the greatest dramas always remain contemporary. \"Because they touch on basic human terrors. We could be Medea saying to Jason, 'If you leave me, I'll kill the children.' Horrific though it is, we can understand that possessive love. Believe me, I understand possessive love.\" </p> <p>Davies left school when he was 15, qualified for little but victimhood. After the four years of bliss following his father's death, he went on to secondary school where he was bullied constantly. His voice is smoky, seductive, with little trace of Liverpool. For some reason, he says, at school he started to talk like the Queen Mother. When he left, he worked as an unqualified accountant for 12 years. He hates the fact that he had the pedantic, quibbling mind to be a good accountant. He also trained and worked as an actor for many of those years. He knew, though, that he didn't have the physical appeal to become a huge success. Davies complains that he looks like an avocado. </p> <p>\"I'd give anything to be really good-looking and have a wonderful body and be really stupid,\" he says. \"It's an unbeatable combo.\" </p> <p>The radio presenter makes the inevitable comparison with Martin Scorsese, who also adapted a Wharton book, The Age of Innocence. Davies protests. \"Martin Scorsese is a huge name! I'm not a huge name. I go into a room full of people and I'm the only person I've not heard of. I think his film is a masterpiece. There are shots I would die for.\" He describes one, and looks as if he's about to explode with enthusiasm. </p> <p>\"God, it's ravishing. I don't feel in the same class as Martin Scorsese. Although I must say I met him when he came to London. He invited me to dinner, which was so charming. So charming . And he's got a very good sense of humour. I said, 'What's your next film?' He said it was about the Dalai Lama, and I said, 'What are you going to call it, Hello Dalai?' And he said, 'No, Raging Lama!' \" Davies dissolves into hysterics, as does the presenter. </p> <p>\"First you make me cry, now you're making me laugh,\" she says. \"You're making me forget everything.\" \"It's a gift,\" Davies says. He's turned into No\u00ebl Coward. The pair of them are flirting like crazy inside their tiny booth. </p> <p>We're walking along Sixth Avenue towards his hotel. Davies is talking about how American musicals and the Ealing comedies influenced him. I ask him whether he's joking about the comedies. No, he says. Of course not. </p> <p>Earlier in the day he had said how churlish the English could be, and cited the saying \"too clever by half\" as an example. I wonder what his family makes of the man who finds it hard to open his mouth without quoting Shakespeare or Keats or TS Eliot. Do they call him too clever by half? \"No. They're terribly proud of me, as I'm proud of them. But they think this life is glamour, and it's not. Why should I spoil it for them, though?\" When his mother was alive they'd speak to each other every day at 6pm. \"If I was somewhere like here, I'd phone up and say, 'Guess where I am, Mum? New York.' And she'd say, 'You're not !'\" He smiles. </p> <p>When he made Distant Voices, Still Lives it was tough on the family. Some of his brothers and sisters felt he was wrong to expose his father, that it was private business. \"But my mum just said, 'He's told the truth.' Which was pretty fantastic. She was a pretty fantastic woman. She had no bitterness in her.\" </p> <p>Davies was only six and a half when his father, a rag and bone man, died, but he says those few years damaged him for life. \"I'm still acutely aware of atmosphere in a room. When I was a kid I'd run into a room and if he didn't want anyone around, he'd just kick me from one end of the house to the other. You don't make that mistake very often.\" </p> <p>Did he ever think his father would kill him? \"No. What was terrifying was the silences, and the cruelty that was in the air. Then it would all start again. I thought he'd kill my mum because on one occasion he just picked up an axe. My eldest sister hit him over the head with a milk bottle. I didn't want her to die. I thought, 'What would I do if she died?'\" </p> <p>Every day he feels the influence of his father - in his relationship with other people. \"The damage that is done when you're a child is so long-lasting. Especially having your self-esteem taken away. You can never regain it. I feel inferior to most men, especially if they've got good bodies and are good-looking. I really feel inferior, and I have to say I'm full of jealousy.\" </p> <p>He says he regards his homosexuality as a curse. \"I loathe it. It's ruined my life, and I wish I were normal and ordinary. I'm no good at sex anyway.\" He is celibate and says he has long forsaken the dream of a boyfriend and stable domestic gay life. His guilt was compounded by his Catholicism. \"On one occasion I prayed until my knees bled.\" At 22 he rejected Catholicism as a lie. </p> <p>But if Terence Davies seems miserable now, that is just one side of him. He feels joy as intensely as despair. When he talks about Shostakovich, Brahms, poetry, or the \"women's films\" he loves, or the paintings of Vermeer and the magical way that light falls on a window, he is transported. </p> <p>Laura Linney, who also stars in The House Of Mirth, says: \"He is the most passionate person I have ever met. He has enormous passion for his work, his life, his likes, his dislikes.\" </p> <p>I tell him how great it's been to see him so upbeat in public. Yes, he says, it's been a successful trip, it's been lovely seeing old friends and, yes, he does get enormous pleasure from so many things. He qualifies himself. He says he knows, just knows, some small thing will happen in the next few days to ruin it all. \"I tell you. I'll see something that in anybody else would just not matter and it will make me feel so depressed, someone crossing the street or an old person not being helped or something, and that's it - the veil falls from life and you see what lies behind it, and it's absolute terror.\" </p> <p>Sometimes his own words seem to bring on another bout of nausea. He says he's aware of what he's trying to achieve when he tells people about his life, about the wounds. \"I'm saying, 'Love me, love me; like me, like me.' And at 55, there's something really rather tawdry about that. It's adolescent, for God's sake.\" </p> <p> <strong> Day 3: the premiere</strong> <br></p> <p> The fans are milling outside the Lincoln Center. Fans of Gillian Anderson, fans of The X Files, fans of Edith Wharton. There may well even be a few Terence Davies fans somewhere. One elderly woman tells me she's waiting to see Anderson. \"She's an actress, isn't she? They told me she'd be here tonight. I've never seen her before.\" Security refuse to let me in. \"Hey, you could be an assassin for all we know,\" says the man with the unwelcoming muscles. </p> <p>Eventually Davies arrives and I follow on his coat-tails. We walk through a tunnel of flashing cameras. \"They don't have a clue who I am,\" he says. He's probably right. In the green room, the actors and Davies gather before the screening. They are all working on different projects. When they ask him what he's moved on to, he holds his hands up. There is no new project. All his energy is still consumed in this film. Six years, and he never had time to think what may be next. \"I've no savvy. It's stupidity. Stupidity. I'm dim.\" </p> <p>I ask Eric Stoltz, who plays Gillian Anderson's unrequited lover, what Davies is like to work with. \"Terry is a whirlwind of passion. He's a Tasmanian devil crossed with Doris Day. He gets so passionately involved in everything he does that he becomes a dervish of activity and emotion.\" He looks over to Davies, who is giving someone a huge hug. \"He's quite subdued now, but on set... when he is up, there is no greater joy in the world than being around him.\" And when he's down? \"When he is in a dark place the world becomes darker. He's a truly lovely and unique artist. I do worry about him out in the world, though, because he feels things so deeply.\" </p> <p>Stoltz says, as an American actor, he was used to having things his own way; and suddenly Davies comes along and tells him how to say every line. \"He doesn't so much direct as conduct. He had the film in his head and we were there to serve his vision. However much it drove us mad, it also delighted us and intrigued us and fascinated us and we ended up loving him.\" </p> <p>In the centre of the room, Davies is engaged in a heated conversation with the actor Anthony LaPaglia. Others look keen to speak to him but keep their distance. </p> <p>Davies and the cast arrive in the box to see the last minutes of the film. At the end, a spotlight falls on them and they get a wonderful reception. Davies looks ecstatic. As the light goes down, he and producer Olivia Stewart are hugging in the dark. The hug turns into a slow dance. </p> <p>He's in terrific form in the post-film question and answer session. He tells the audience that he has cheered up no end since he's been seeing a shrink. \"My therapist and I have really bonded. Even he hates my father now.\" He says he still doesn't know anything about The X Files. \"It's about the paranormal, they say. Well the only paranormal I know is the internal revenue service.\" When asked what his next project will be, he says he fancies remaking some well-known films, \"but I'd do them as prequels, on very little money - Conan the Librarian, Strangers on a Bicycle, Monsieur Hulot Goes to Thomas Cook\". </p> <p>The guy who runs the festival doubles up. \"What a crack-up,\" he says. </p> <p>A woman with a first edition of The House of Mirth is among the autograph hunters outside. She looks at Davies intensely. \"I was a little worried about what you'd do with the book, but really you've done a very good job,\" she says. </p> <p> <strong> Day 4: the aftermath</strong> <br></p> <p> Davies seems in great nick. He's just had a bad review in the New York Times and he says he doesn't care. \"It just doesn't matter. We've done our best, and the audience reaction has, I think, proved that it is good. For the first time in my life I think I'm growing up and thinking it doesn't matter.\" About time too, I say. \"You're right, absolutely right. I can't tell you how right you are. I can look at it now with a kind of aesthetic difference and say, 'If people don't like it, I'm sorry about that,' but it doesn't destroy me like it used to. It used to destroy me.\" </p> <p>The new confidence lasts approximately a minute. He starts talking about yesterday's shopping debacle. When I look confused he says, \"Oh, didn't I tell you? I went to buy some perfume for my sister, and I know I've got some credit, $300-$400 credit on my card, but they wouldn't take it.\" He's telling the story with great brio, and I'm expecting a cracking punchline. But suddenly Davies's eyes are swirling with tears. \"I was desperately embarrassed, really humiliated, and I came back, rang Barclaycard, and the hotel had put the whole cost of my room, nearly \u00a31,000, on to my card, despite the fact that it said on the computer that Sony are paying for it.\" The tears are dribbling down his cheeks. \"I know it's silly to be upset by something like that. I was really low for some reason. Well, I know the reason. I get homesick after four days. I go back to the hotel and literally want to blow my brains out. This is just the anus mundi.\" What's that? \"The arse of the world\", and he smiles the softest of smiles. </p> <p>Davies is broke. He has never made money from his films. And even though The House of Mirth is his biggest budget movie, at $8m, his salary has been deferred and deferred again. He says he's not venal or greedy, but he's tired of living hand to mouth. I ask him what his ambition is, and he doesn't mention making it in America, or Oscars. \"I'd just like enough money to live on. I'm sick of struggling from one set of debts to another.\" </p> <p>What was that intense conversation about last night with Anthony LaPaglia? \"The trouble with me is I have no small talk,\" he says. \"Anthony was asking me why there was no music, and I was telling him that it didn't need any.\" Did LaPaglia like the film? \"I think he did, but it's hard to tell. I don't know. I didn't ask. If people like it they'll say, and if they don't say anything I assume they don't like it.\" </p> <p>Did Gillian Anderson like it? \"Well she didn't say, so I don't know.\" Did he want her to say she liked it? \"That would have given me a great deal of pleasure, yes it would have. The fact that she didn't ... it hurt me, yes. All she said was congratulations, but that's like saying the scenery's nice.\" </p> <p>I'm still trying to cheer him up, but failing miserably. You look so much better than when I saw you last, I say. Yes, he mutters, he hit rock bottom when his mother died. \"I wanted to die. I did. That's it, I thought. There's nothing else to live for, there just isn't because she was the love of my life. I loved her with all my heart, and I was able to tell her.\" He talks about the pleasure he got from being able to feed her, from making her last days comfortable. \"I just held her, and I just said, 'I love you so much,' and we didn't say anything else. I just held her hand.\" </p> <p>Did he really think he would kill himself? \"I don't think I have the courage, because I don't think it's an act of cowardice, I think it's courage - and I haven't got it.\" </p> <p>He talks about the handful of Edith Wharton boppers at last night's screening. \"Look at those young girls last night. Full of hope, those little faces, and you do pray that the hope doesn't get crushed. But what happens when hope is not realised, or crushed, or when hope is betrayed?\" This question seems to be at the heart of all Davies's films. Again he says he wishes he were good-looking and stupid, unaware. He probably says it every day, but never for effect. </p> <p>Then he asks who it was who said that truth can be bleak and painful, and only a lie is beautiful. \"Looking into your heart can be a very painful process. Being aware is a mug's game. An absolute mug's game.\" </p> <p> \u0095 The House of Mirth is released next Friday.</p>"
