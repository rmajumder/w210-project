  "<p>From The Cherry Orchard, which opened last week at the National Theatre, to A Streetcar Named Desire: suddenly, insolvent toffs are all the rage. Perhaps it's because their crises tell us something about ours. Tennessee Williams's play pitches naked privilege against brute consumerism; as incarnated by that devastating duo Blanche Dubois and Stanley Kowalski, the latter isn't an improvement on the former. </p> <p>Andy Hay's production reanimates their primal duel in an atmospheric 1940s New Orleans, where jazz tunes hang in the air like heat-haze and the neighbours argue so violently that plaster shakes down from the Kowalskis' ceiling. In a staging punctuated with blues singing from Ruby Turner as Eunice, Hay hits only a few bum notes - the incidental music, for example, can be too insistent. So can Williams's symbolism - mournful Mexicans shuffling past the window, indeed - but there's little Hay can do about that. </p> <p>The star of a proficient cast, John Sharian turns in an electrifying performance as the mercenary brother-in-law into whose lap destitute Blanche has the misfortune to fall. When blind-drunk, and having beaten his pregnant wife, Sharian's Stanley moans like a wounded animal; when triumphant, he throws his \"Ha!\" at Blanche like vitriol. Sharian balances the admirable with the ruthless in a character whose monstrousness is, until the bitter end, kept straining at its leash. </p> <p>Tara Fitzgerald as Blanche lacks Sharian's force of personality, while her good looks are too rosily robust for a woman who characterises the frail grandeur of the Deep South. But she snares Blanche's lethal combination of neediness and hauteur, and she's a fantastic flirt: the paperboy doesn't know what's hit him. </p> <p>Hay stokes up the resulting passions to such an extent that the tension surrounding his production's denouement - in which Blanche departs for the asylum under the gaze of her alienated suitor Mitch, Stella the treacherous sister and Stanley himself - positively throbs. With Blanche, thought Williams, went not just snobbery and hypocrisy, but the belief in an archaic civility. Is that a baby Stella's holding when the lights dim, or did she and Stanley just sling it out with the bathwater? </p> <p>\u0095 Until October 14. Box office: 0117-987 7877.</p>",
  "<p>What next, after the mighty wrecking ball finally sets about Wembley, Venue of Legends and the Legless?</p> <p> I foresee Ken Bates, the FA's supremo of unbuilt stadiums, stumbling into the gallery of Millennium cock-ups alongside Peter Mandelson of the Dying Dome and Ove Arup, who built the Shake-Rattle-and-Roll Bridge over the Thames to the Tate Modern gallery. </p> <p>How can it be otherwise for Bates, when every estimate climbs like a maddened rocket? The talk a few years back was of \u00a3200 million for a gleaming colosseum to house World Cups and an Olympic Games. </p> <p>Last year that more than doubled to \u00a3103 million for the land plus \u00a3320 million for rebuilding - and the Olympics had fallen off the inventory. It's football only. The price leapt to \u00a3465 million earlier this year. Now I hear \u00a3600 million for construction, which, you can be sure, will be closer to a billion by the laying of the last brick. </p> <p>Yet what will ordinary spectators really gain? Cosier seats, unobstructed views, escalators everywhere and, in a little touch of luxury, the end of urinals that rot their shoes. The public of 2000AD are entitled to take such modifications for granted. </p> <p>But Nike Stadium, Tesco Towers, Ken's Kingdom or whatever they dub New Wembley will remain outdated and unsatisfactory until shifted from the horrible inconvenience of being jammed between residential areas and industrial estates; a clogged warren that entangles drivers who enter and which can delay them until nearly midnight when going home. </p> <p>Tubes and trains are over-crowded, scruffy, and uncomfortable. Sometimes threatening. Police protection? You're on your own! Parking? Best to come by coach or to get yourself elected to the FA Council, whose members and cronies enjoy guaranteed parking and kill time after matches in a dining hall with cosy bars. </p> <p>It's like First World War generals feasting in an out-of-range chateau without a care for the poor sods (read fans, in this case) at the front. The analogy is closer than you may think, for the segregation of supporters and officialdom has persisted since Wembley opened in 1923, not a full five years after the boys came marching home. </p> <p>Why don't the FA uproot themselves from Wembley? Partly because they are scared of straying outside the M25 - which is like a blanket around them. They might get nosebleeds letting go. Also the various MPs, diplomats and other influential poncers of tickets feel uneasy if too far from the West End. </p> <p>Yet land is cheaper on the far side of the motorway, and the M25 is ringed by planning officers prepared to use every legitimate inducement that might capture a national stadium for their community. In the Seventies, for instance, 100 acres outside Watford were offered in vain to the FA for a new Wembley plus a soccer school and training quarters. </p> <p>Much more recently, some 200 acres of the old Hatfield aerodrome (where Steven Spielberg shot battle scenes in Saving Private Ryan ) were identified for the Minister of Sport as available for erecting the greatest arena in Britain, some 20 miles from London with motorway access and fast trains to King's Cross and the North. </p> <p>In fairness to the FA, it has to be realised that soccer finals and a sprinkling of internationals alone cannot meet the full costs of running a stadium. Wembley itself was no goldmine, being sold in the late Twenties (after a bankrupted buyer killed himself) for less than a sixth of what it cost to build. A syndicate bought it outright for \u00a3122,500 and began scuffling for a regular income from new sports. </p> <p>Dog-racing (50,000 for the first meeting) was followed by speedway (average gates of 19,000 one season) and then by the building in 1934 of the Empire Pool as a year-round showcase for boxing, ice hockey, skating spectaculars and the Harlem Globetrotters with Wilt 'the Stilt' Chamberlain and 'Meadowlark' Lemon always playing basketball against a team called simply The Opposition. Mainly white and never allowed to win. </p> <p>They were all stars in their way. Chick Zanuck, a tempestuous competitor on ice. All the Globetrotters. Heavyweights Jack Petersen and Len Harvey meeting at Wembley for the British title, which Petersen retained on points over 15 rounds. </p> <p>But the stadium's truly great stars, drawing crowds the country could only marvel at, were outdoors on the stadium's football pitch. This was proved beyond argument in Wembley's inaugural match: Bolton Wanderers v West Ham in the 1923 FA Cup Final. The Policeman on the White Horse final. The game that brought us Bubbles , music hall hit of the year when adopted by the Hammers as still the most tuneful and wryest of club songs. </p> <p>Statisticians never admit to guesswork, but their gate figure of 126,047 is sheer conjecture - and probably wrong by a whopping 70,000. The stadium's official report says: 'The total may have exceeded 200,000.' </p> <p>Mistake No 1: It was pay at the gate. Mistake No 2: Admission was ridiculously cheap at only a florin (10p today). Mistake No.3: The gates and barriers were frail. They shut at 1.45pm but were smashed and swept aside in minutes. </p> <p>By 2.45,the pitch was black with people while the Grenadier and the Irish Guards band played unseen in the multitude. At 2.46, the FA's thoughts of an abandonment were squelched by King George the Fifth, an old sailor prone to salty language and saying in effect to fluttering officials: 'Bugger going home! Clear the damned pitch, instead!' </p> <p>Enter George Scorey on Billy. It was the first match the constable had seen and he never attended or watched another - yet remains indelibly in football history for bringing order into chaos. As he said later: 'The horse, being white, commanded attention and seemed to understand what was required. Also the crowd were good-tempered as he eased them back with his nose until we cleared the goal line.' </p> <p>David Jack scored for Bolton in the second minute. His shot with the old heavy casey whirred past goalkeeper Hufton before crashing into spectators (standing on the trampled netting of the Hammers' goal) and flattening them like dominoes. </p> <p>The teams spent half time on the pitch, there being no way off. Centre-forward John Smith then scored Bolton's second from a move begun by a spectator's pass. </p> <p>West Ham promptly demanded an abandonment. Bolton retorted: 'We'll play till dusk.' The ref waved play on and it finished 2-0. Next the FA entered a new term into football's language: 'All-ticket', which the final has been ever since. </p> <p>Oh Wembley, Wembley, Wembley, where I watched two Liverpool supporters kneeling on the pitch after the 1974 final and kissing Bill Shankly's shoes. But the range was too long to hear the great manager, quite unabashed, say: 'While you're down there, give them a good polish.' Oh Wembley, where I saw Danny Blanchflower captain the Spurs in the stadium's first League-and-Cup double final and 19-year-old Charlie George shoot Arsenal to parity of glory 10 years later. </p> <p>Wembley was where I saw the Liverpool and Manchester United doubles and the European Cup finals won there by both clubs. A couple of those six matches fell short of meriting the ecstasy exhibited by the supporters, but don't mention it to the players. As time goes by, all members of winning teams (as Shakespeare said in another context) 'remember with advantages'. Wembley, where I didn't see Fanny Blankers-Koen of Holland, 30 and a mum, win four gold medals. The 100 and 200 metres, the 80 metres hurdles and the 4 x 100 relay. She ran the anchor leg in the 1948 Olympics, the austerity games of Spam-fritter dinners, dried egg, meals in school halls and athletes housed in tents. </p> <p>It was also the games of Branislav Stankovic, left-back and silver medallist of Yugoslavia. 'Stinker' if modern headline writers had been at work when he was sent off in the final against Sweden. The first dismissal in Wembley history. You could win a quiz knowing that. </p> <p>Away with such villains and bring on more heroes. Shaun Edwards of Wigan playing in the Rugby League final against Warrington for an hour with a fractured cheek and saying nothing: 'I didn't want them to know I was hurt.' </p> <p>These were real men. I once found Great Britain's XIII in their dressing room getting stuck into beer after beating Australia 19-12. The sponsor's champagne? Washed their hair in it. I think of Michel Platini, several months retired and without any training apart from two sets of tennis, taking on a Football League Centenary XI and showing them how to play.</p> <p> I think of Pel\u00e9 and the pity that he never played any closer to Wembley than Craven Cottage in a testimonial. And what a nice touch if England invited him, as a Fifa ambassador and the only holder of three World Cup winners' medals, to do the honours for the old stadium's finale against Germany next month.</p> <p>I think of Bobby Moore and the last time I saw him, broadcasting from Wembley although knowing death was at his shoulder. I think of all the 1966 team - Gordon, George, Jackie, Bobby Moore, Ray, Alan, Bobby Charlton, Martin, Roger and Geoff - and feel somewhat disloyal for entertaining the idea that three years earlier even they had been outranked in Wembley stardom.</p> <p>It was June, a cool evening and I'm among a 53,000 crowd watching Elizabeth Taylor sashay down the steps to ringside on the turf. She appeared first and he, 21-year-old Cassius Clay, bounded into the spotlight wearing a rhinestone crown (although not yet a champ) and a red dressing-gown proclaiming 'Cassius the Greatest'. American reporters eyed him quizzically. Many of them believed he was gay. The same theory was being checked out by at least one Fleet Street newspaper, but events proved that young Cassius had a hungry look for Liz. He kept eyeing her over the ropes.</p> <p>Filling in time by dancing and pulling faces until carrying out his forecast of a fifth-round stoppage of the 'bum and cripple' opponent - in fact, British heavyweight champion Henry Cooper. The fourth was close to ending when Clay took a peek too many. Cooper's left fist, thrown from blood and desperation, left him sprawled through the ropes. Clay, by normal standards, was gone, yet he stood sort of upright at the bell almost nobody could hear in the din. </p> <p>Over and over, Angelo Dundee had warned; 'If there's one thing Cooper can do, it's to whack with the left hand.' Here the trainer wasted no time on recriminations, saying only 'Ice his balls' as the corner-men caught Cassius before he could fall. Dundee's attention was on a split in his man's left glove. </p> <p>He gave it an educated tug. The damage widened and a replacement was sanctioned. Strangely, there wasn't one anywhere, but the minute's delay was all Cassius needed. In two minutes and 15 seconds of the fifth, it was all over, with blood everywhere and thousands screaming 'Stop it'. </p> <p>Slurs on the sexuality of Cassius/ Muhammad began dying then and there. Soon team doctor Pacheco would jest about his fighter's recruitment by Black Muslims: 'He'll be a pelvic missionary.' And, two fights later, who should be ringside again for Ali's first round KO of Sonny Liston in Maine? Miss Taylor. </p> <p>What a fascinating Wembley memoir and well worth a picture on the Valhalla Board that the new stadium should be planning now if mindful of the warning that the country perishes which forgets its history. Footballers, of course, will dominate it. A shot, for instance of Dixie Dean, captain of Everton and, when only 20, scorer of 60 First Division goals in a season. He's receiving the FA Cup from the Queen Mum - and it's so long ago that she was still the Duchess of York. </p> <p>Stanley Matthews, leaning like a skier when aiming that decisive cross to Bill Perry, must be shown. Everyone from 1966 should be displayed and, if anybody can find it, the picture of Sir Alf Ramsey so concentrated on play that he's falling off the bench from which everyone else jumped to hail Geoff Hurst's clinching goal. In recognition of the most dazzling team that this stadium ever welcomed... a picture of Ferenc Puskas and his 1953 Hungarians. </p> <p>Come to think of it, we should show our English sportsmanship by similarly honouring every side who have defeated England at Wembley. To wit, Hungary, Sweden, Austria, West Germany, Italy, Holland, Spain, Brazil, Denmark, Russia, Uruguay, Germany, Chile and France.</p> <p>I realise this would also mean a long gallery of nine Scottish XIs but it could save the FA a fortune. For there's every chance of the Jocks showing their appreciation by demolishing Wembley for free, as they so nearly did in 1967 and 1977.</p>",
  "<p>For reasons too complex to explain, I have just spent a fortnight in Ghana. It proved an excellent place to watch two other West African countries, Cameroon and Nigeria, reach the quarter-finals of the Olympic tournament. </p> <p>Most Ghanaians support Nigeria and Cameroon, but not very passionately. There were no street celebrations, for instance, when the Super Eagles squeezed into the quarter-finals. Africans are becoming blas\u00e9 about footballing triumphs. Nigeria took the gold in the last Olympics, and Ghana habitually win youth World Cups. </p> <p>Moreover, few Ghanaians have seen much of the Olympics. Even in Accra, the capital, only one home in four has a television set. Instead, radios announce that an Olympic vehicle has been hijacked by an escaped convict, or that a Nigerian athlete has been run over. </p> <p>Ghanaians empathise with Nigeria for the loss of Nwankwo Kanu, withheld by Arsenal. Every African country knows how that feels. Indeed, Ghanaians judge footballers largely on their willingness to come home to play for the national team 'to serve the country', as they put it. So Alex Nyarko, the Everton midfielder, is well regarded here. </p> <p>Nyarko even made it to the recent match in Lesotho, the mountain kingdom at the bottom of Africa. He left at half-time, flying off to play for Everton against Spurs, but Ghanaians appreciated the effort. </p> <p>As one ex-pro told me: 'Nyarko is not a player who comes driving up in a posh-posh car. When Abedi Pel\u00e9 is in town, you know that he is here. When Tony Yeboah is here, also. With Nyarko, only when you meet him personally you know that he is in town.' </p> <p>Watching African players in Europe, with their Italian clothes and rap music, it can be hard to imagine how they grew up. Roger Milla, the great Cameroonian, was once a railway worker's son picking fights on the streets of Yaounde. Clemens Westerhof, the Dutchman who used to coach Nigeria, says he first noticed Kanu at a derelict ground in the middle of nowhere when out of a tiny team bus emerged a boy beanpole bent almost double. </p> <p>Abedi Pel\u00e9, it seems, grew up in a town in the far north of Ghana, where his many relatives traded across the Burkina Faso border in grain, currencies, sheep and goats. (Crucially, it seems, Ghanaian sheep and goats are slightly different to Burkinabe ones.) I was told by this by the son of a former chief of this town, who was wearing a T-shirt that said, 'Dennis Bergkamp: he's as cold as ice.' </p> <p>This man praised Pel\u00e9 as a 'lavish giver', who has built dormitories at local schools so that students can board. </p> <p>One of the delights of West African football is the team names. Perhaps the best is the Ghanaian side Mysterious Dwarfs. The players aren't really dwarfs, unlike the minor Cameroonian side Ants of Salapoumbe, whose players really are pygmies. Rather, in Ghanaian folklore dwarfs possess mysterious powers. One man told me a story about a Muslim who had procured a bunch of dwarfs to come with him to collect some gold; but after he had bought them gin, the dwarfs made themselves invisible and 'beat him rough-rough'. </p> <p>Similarly, the Dwarfs club became the Mysterious Dwarfs because often, when they appeared beaten, they somehow won. 'But that is not helping them this year,' noted my informant. </p> <p>When it comes to corruption, Africans speak of Nigeria with a sort of awe. The watchdog Transparency International has adjudged Nigeria the world's most corrupt nation, a title previously held by Cameroon. Ghana, though straighter than both, is not entirely pure. </p> <p>Last Sunday I watched Accra's Hearts of Oak stumble their way towards the Ghanaian title. Hearts have been so poor recently that some say they are throwing matches. But on Sunday, against Okwawu United, the referee kept bailing them out. In the first half he disallowed two Okwawu goals, denied Okwawu a penalty, and refused to send off a Hearts player for flattening a striker who had only the keeper to beat. 'Referees are always lenient to Hearts,' confided my neighbour, a Hearts fan. </p> <p>Quite likely the referee was honest: he was even-handed in the second half, and the game ended 1-1. But whereas in Britain only tedious conspiracy theorists think referees support Manchester United, in Africa you don't have to be paranoid to suspect a fix. </p> <p>Ghana have won four African Nations Cups, but have never qualified for a World Cup, and its fans are reduced to supporting Cameroon and Nigeria. It is clear why Nigeria is better at football: there are 120 million Nigerians. But why does Cameroon outperform Ghana? </p> <p>As one of the few living humans to have visited both countries, I have a theory. Every lunchtime, evening and weekend, Yaounde, Cameroon's capital, turns into a vast football field. On every spare scrap of land there is a game. </p> <p>In Accra, however, the only footballs you are likely to see are those thrust at you by street vendors. In that way the city resembles London, where very few play but millions support.</p>",
  "<p><strong> LUCAS NEILL</strong> </p> <p><strong> Millwall/Australia, Midfielder</strong> </p> <p> Australia's Olympic games disappointment should provide a strong incentive ahead of the Oceania World Cup tournament. Neill - whose regular international call-ups have irritated Millwall - is a versatile midfielder, considered one good season away from a move to a bigger club. </p> <p>Signed on a free in November 1995, the 22-year-old made an excellent early impression as defender, midfielder and striker, voted Player of the Year and earning his first senior international cap. A series of injuries slowed his rate of progress, but his form and his adaptability has recovered: whoever takes over as Millwall's new manager will be pleased with the versatile Neill. </p> <p><strong> Australia </strong> have a decent chance of qualification: Neill and colleagues face Tonga, Fiji, American Samoa and Samoa in Group One. </p> <p> <strong> TEPI MOILANEN</strong> </p> <p><strong> Preston/Finland, Goalkeeper</strong> </p> <p> Preston keeper Tepi Moilanen could be famous by the end of next month. The 6ft 5in Finn, currently enjoying professional anonymity at Deepdale, will become public, tabloid property in the build-up to his country's World Cup qualifier against England in Helsinki next month. </p> <p>Moilanen, an AC/DC fan nicknamed Tepi, is vying with Bolton's Jussi Jaaskelainen for the Finnish number one jersey, and on current form is a likely starter. </p> <p>After arriving from Jaro, struggling to adapt and spending time on loan toughening up at Scarborough and Darlington, Tepi displaced England youth keeper David Lucas to become first choice. </p> <p><strong> Finland's </strong> chances of reaching the finals are mixed: they opened with a 2-1 win over Albania, but this World Cup may have arrived two years early. They can, though, be tough to beat in Helsinki - as England will doubtless prove. </p> <p> <strong> STEFAN THORDARSON</strong> </p> <p><strong> Stoke/Iceland, Midfielder</strong> </p> <p> One of the growing Icelandic contingent at the Britannia Stadium, Thordarson has settled quickly since arriving on a free from Bayer Uerdingen - catching the eye early on with a vicious free kick against Liverpool in pre-season. He's no relation to Gudjon Thordarson, the manager who brought him to England in the summer, but did play under him when the Stoke boss was in charge of the national team. </p> <p><strong> Iceland</strong> remain unremarkable on the international stage. They were unlucky to lose 2-1 to Denmark in their opening Group Three qualifier in Reykjavik last month, but the coming trip to the Czech Republic offers little cause for optimism in a group which also contains Bulgaria and Northern Ireland. Iceland are up-and-coming - ranked 52 in the world - but Thordarson and colleagues will have to battle to make it to Japan. </p> <p> <strong> IVAN TISTIMETANU</strong> </p> <p><strong> Bristol C/Moldova, Defender</strong> </p> <p> Signed by Benny Lennartsson for \u00a3225,000 in December 1998, Tistimetanu was quickly dubbed 'Iron Testicles' by Bristol City fans impressed by the wildness of his challenges, and by the complexities of his surname. When Tistimetanu tackles, they say, you stay tackled. </p> <p>The two-time Moldovan player of the year and leader of his country's World Cup bid is as well liked in Bristol as he is at home - adding capable midfield qualities to his defensive hard man reputation. Comfortable on the ball, and with a shot which would burst nets if on target more often, he's proved himself an invaluable ball-winner - but still needs to convince new manager Danny Wilson to make him part of his long-term plans. </p> <p><strong> Moldova </strong> had a losing start in Group four, going down 2-0 in Turkey - they'll need to do better against Slovakia, Azerbaijan and Macedonia to stand a chance. </p> <p> <strong> VITALY ASTAFJEVS</strong> </p> <p><strong> Bristol R/Latvia, Midfielder</strong> </p> <p> Before Astafjevs - Latvia's most capped player - arrived at Bristol Rovers, the club had only one foreigner, and he was a Scot. But, with the midfielder settled in and performing well after his protracted transfer from Skonta Riga, Rovers are realising the benefit of importing a creative influence. </p> <p>The fans have taken him to heart with an 'Ooh aah, it's a Latvian' chant (inspired by the Ambrosia ad). 'He's become a real favourite here,' says Rovers' commercial manager Ralph Ellis. 'You don't get many foreign players at this level so we had to be sure we were getting the right man for the job. He has already proved us right.' </p> <p>Astafjevs is also the key man and captain in the plans of <strong> Latvia </strong> manager Gary Johnson - but, having already lost to Scotland, the side have a lot to do to avoid an early end to their campaign. </p> <p> <strong> EFETOBORE SODJE</strong> </p> <p><strong> Crewe/Nigeria, Defender</strong> </p> <p> Regular international duty nearly ended Efe Sodje's career in England: during the summer, Colchester lost patience with his regular absences and released him. Rescued by Crewe manager Dario Gradi, the Greenwich-born, bandana-wearing Sodje will be a certain squad member in 2002, barring a dramatic loss of form. </p> <p>Having spent much of his career regarded as one of the best lower-league defenders around, now, at the age of 27, his long-touted move into the big-time looks unlikely. A strong performer, he began his career at Stevenage and is a regular in Nigeria's 'Super Eagles' squad - though still rarely a first team starter. His famous bandana (Motto: Against All Odds) is worn on the advice of his mother, who won't allow him to take it off. </p> <p><strong> Nigeria's </strong> standing in Africa is akin to France's in Europe: they will qualify - and they're contenders for the trophy. </p> <p> <strong> WALTER BOYD</strong> </p> <p><strong> Swansea/Jamaica, Striker</strong> </p> <p> Time was when Jamaica was known only for the three R's - reggae, rastafarianism and Red Stripe - but, in the last four years, the Caribbean island's football team has emerged as a must-watch side, with a world ranking of 38. </p> <p>Swansea's Boyd, a powerful forward who has been a regular goalscorer in Division Three, is a folk hero back home: popular manager Rene Simoes almost found himself hounded out of office when he briefly overlooked Boyd's talents. </p> <p>Now that many of the 'bandwagon jumpers' - players like Robbie Earle and Fitzroy Simpson who discovered their Caribbean heritage just in time to play in the last World Cup - have gone, the <strong> Jamaica </strong> squad are determined to prove that their success last time was not a one-off. They've won group D, and could well be one of the three to qualify from the northern and central American zone. </p> <p> <strong> FAN ZHIYI</strong> </p> <p><strong> Crystal Palace/China, Defender</strong> </p> <p> Fan Zhiyi's first goal in English football against Bury two years ago was seen by 3,546 at Selhurst Park - and 500 million in China. After 64 appearances, 1.3bn Chinese viewers remain captivated: those who can afford to, attend the matches, the rest watch on national television. </p> <p>Fan's form in England has peaked this year: an 11sec 100m runner, he's proved himself dynamic in defence and powerful in attack - also leading a 22-man brawl against Forest earlier this season. A hundred million pre-teen Chinese groupies will be seeing a lot more of him during next month's Asian Games - he'll miss a month of football for Palace, before he returns to China for World Cup qualifying. </p> <p><strong> China's</strong> chances are better now than ever before. They're led by Bora Milutinovic - who has taken Costa Rica, Mexico, USA and Nigeria to previous finals - and recently beat Guam 19-0. </p> <p> <strong> STERN JOHN</strong> </p> <p><strong> Nottingham Forest/Trinidad, Striker</strong> </p> <p> Lazy or lacking in confidence? Forest fans still aren't sure what to make of Dwight Yorke's international partner. When he arrived for \u00a31.5m from American MLS side Columbus Crew in November, David Platt was keen to protect him: 'It's unfair to heap pressure on his shoulders - we can't expect too much.' But after a debut goal and assist, and the knowledge that John had scored 52 in 65 games for his previous club, fans have been disappointed with the lack of fireworks since. </p> <p>But John, 25 next month, is still recovering from a cruciate ligament injury suffered two months into his Forest career. He made a remarkable comeback before the end of the season, but is still sluggish and under-achieving. His <strong> Trinidad &amp; Tobago</strong> place, though, is secure - he's been capped 30 times, and manager Ian Porterfield, whose side are progressing well through qualifying, expects big things. </p> <p> <strong> MOHAMED CAMARA</strong> </p> <p><strong> Wolves/Guinea, Defender</strong> </p> <p> Wolves' new defender Mohamed Camara (there are more Mohamed Camara's in Guinea than there are John Smith's in England) has followed Liverpool's Titi and Inter Milan's Zoumana in promoting the Camara name in European football. The 26-year-old, though, is yet to make his Wolves debut following a long-term loan move from Le Havre this summer, but remains an international regular. </p> <p><strong> Guinea </strong> have much in their favour as they try to reach the finals for the first time, including Fifa's decision to grant Africa five qualifying places and their Fifa world ranking of 78 - above Northern Ireland and Wales. Nevertheless, winning Group E, is likely to prove difficult. A good start, with victories over Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso, has put them top of the table, but they'll be tested to the limit when they play away to South Africa, the favourites, in March. </p> <p> <strong> BAICHUNG BHUTIA</strong> </p> <p><strong> Bury/India, Striker</strong> </p> <p> The first, and so far only, footballer from the sub-continent to play in England, Baichung Bhutia has made a big impression at Bury - even though he still hasn't attracted the hordes of new Asian fans the club's marketing men had hoped would follow him to Gigg Lane. </p> <p>The 24-year-old striker was brought up in the eastern Indian state of Sikkim and established his reputation with East Bengal, one of the country's top sides. Powerfully built, he's coped well with the physical side of Second Division life, and has developed his game rapidly. Whether <strong> India</strong> will progress far enough for him to play in 2002, though, remains to be seen. Since the country withdrew from the 1950 Finals after being told their players could not play barefoot, India have disappeared from the world stage. A mini-revival has begun, but it's unlikely to be enough to beat the likes of Iran, Saudi Arabia and China.</p>",
  "<p>To the west, England is separated from World Cup 2002 by two oceans, which for the purposes of this exercise we shall call the Atlantic and the Pacific, and by two large land masses, referred to mundanely as North and South America, but which for our purposes we shall designate as Concacaf (the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football), and Conmebol (the Confederacion Sudamericana de Futbol). </p> <p>Conmebol received its name from its discoverer, Pel\u00e9, who, when he first sailed within eyeshot of the beaches of western Bolivia, and observed carefree children kicking about a football, shouted to his first mate, Joseph Conrad, 'Con, me bol, please, so I can join in the game!' Through a natural process of erosion, perhaps hastened by a mandate from Sepp Blatter, this once-famed utterance has been shortened to its present form, Conmebol. </p> <p>As for Concacaf, which lies to the north and encompasses all known atolls between Bermuda and East Guam, little is known of its origins, the purpose of its existence or its proper pronunciation. </p> <p>While both Cons will be sending teams to the World Cup in Japan and Korea, Mebol, as its name might suggest, is of far greater significance than Cacaf, containing within its boundaries at least two countries who have been known to play football skilfully, these being Argentina and Brazil. At present, only Argentina are doing so, but Brazil's failures - in four away matches to date, the 1998 World Cup finalists have managed one win and one draw, scoring only two goals in the process - are proving far more entertaining to aficionados of the hysterical, a phrase recently added to Fifa's list of approved synonyms for 'supporter'. </p> <p>Already we may have seen the last, alas, of the dapper and debonair Brazilian manager, Wanderley Luxemburgo (he of his own wonderful website). For in 'The Land of Ten Thousand Strikers' it is no small embarrassment to have had only two players score goals in more than one of the eight qualifying matches played so far. And it's even worse when, Rivaldo being one, the other is the Roma defender Zago. </p> <p>Surely there was no relation between the two, but only days after Brazil's 3-0 humiliation by Chile, Luxemburgo was charged with tax evasion. Yes, the rusty but inexorable steam engine of Brazilian justice had started to chuff, and not even a subsequent win over hapless Bolivia was able to stop it. </p> <p>Indeed, Luxemborgo's former secretary and lover suddenly moved centre stage, describing for the media 'suitcases stuffed with dollars' in the home they had once shared. Alas, poor Wanderley: he had forgotten the dictum about keeping one's pleasure separate from one's business, especially if one is going to lose to Chile and Peru, and draw with Colombia and Uruguay. </p> <p>For the ex, whose name was Renata Alves, and who herself had been charged with tax evasion, produced a 'little black book' which she said she'd taken from 'their' home when she departed. The book, she said, contained the names of 37 Brazilian players with whom Luxemburgo allegedly had engaged in business practices which had maximised profit by defrauding the government. </p> <p>'I am only speaking out to save my honour,' Ms Alves explained, 'and of course I cannot disclose any of the individual names.' </p> <p>'Well, let me ask you this,' said an enterprising member of the press. 'Among those 37 names would we find, for example, Elivelton, Zinho, Mazinho and Edilson?' </p> <p>'Yes.' </p> <p>But she added that absolutely, not for love nor money, would she disclose the names of the remaining 33. On further behalf of the salvation of her honour, however, Ms Alves did claim that Luxemburgo, while still a club manager, had taken illegal commissions from the sale prices of his players and had used these proceeds to buy at auction certain properties which 'friends' had assured him could be immediately resold for vast profit, with no traces of the transactions appearing on the tax registers. </p> <p>There's a time for fight and a time for flight, and Luxemburgo wasted no time deciding which time it was this time. He flew immediately from Conmebol to Australia, where he vowed to restore his honour by coaching the Brazilian Olympic football team to a gold medal. </p> <p>'They're launching a campaign against me,' he declared. 'I don't know where it's coming from, but I'm being massacred. I don't know who they are, but they're trying to topple me, and the worst part is, I don't even know why.' </p> <p>Let me count the ways, suggested several Brazilian sports columnists, and proceeded to list the forwards Luxemburgo had used in qualifying matches, and those he had ignored. </p> <p>There was, for example, the 'dynamic duo' from Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro: Guilherme de Cassia Alves (no blood relation to Ms Renata Alves has been alleged), and Marques Batista de Abreu, whose selection seemed so bizarre it caused speculation that places on Brazil's national team were, to put it bluntly, up for sale. No formal charge to that effect has yet been brought, but it must be said that the abundance of domestic strikers used at the expense of those playing in Europe has been, well, striking. </p> <p>Francoaldo Sena Souza Franca was chosen from S\u00e3o Paolo; Edilson, who had scored one goal during his club season, came from Flamengo; and another who had failed in Europe, Luis Carlos Goulart Luizao, arrived from Corinthians. None of the above has yet managed to score for Brazil in a Conmebol World Cup qualifier, and their selection by Luxemburgo comes to seem all the more remarkable when one considers forwards over whom his roving eye has passed without pause. That list would include such Europe-based talents as Jardel, Elber, Paulo Sergio, Leonardo, Sonny Anderson, Savio, Jamelli, etc. Even Romario was excluded until after the 3-0 humiliation by Chile. Once added to the team, he immediately scored three goals, making Luxemburgo look all the more stupid - or worse - for not having negotiated his inclusion much sooner. </p> <p>And now, once again, alas poor Wanderley: if he'd thought a Sydney sojourn would grant him respite from his woes, he was once more wide of the mark. For his Olympic team - the team he had chosen and the team he now coached - contrived almost immediately to lose to South Africa. A Brazilian team of any sort losing to South Africa? The cries for Luxemburgo's head (not to mention his wardrobe, and the 'suitcases stuffed with dollars') have at least temporarily silenced the samba beat from the gaudy beaches of Rio to the sombre hallways of Brasilia. Edmundo is facing a four-year prison term for vehicular homicide. But for Wanderley, it seems, nothing less than life (or death) will do. </p> <p>Facing a mid-October court date, which promises to be only the first among many, Luxemburgo might be thinking by now of political asylum. After all, if Australia itself should refuse him, surely a grateful South Africa would not. </p> <p>Or he could always wander down a Sydney street in search of the consulate of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. There, political asylum might prove only the start. Has anyone seen the Luxembourgian national side in action lately? Has anyone noted that manager Paul Phillip hardly cuts a bella figura? For that matter, the whole damned duchy has been looking a little dowdy of late. Wandering Wanderley might be just the man to provide the needed panache. And who knows? If he carries the national team to Portugal for Euro 2004, they just might rename the country in his honour. After all, Luxemburgo is 21st-century in a way Luxembourg can never be.</p>",
  "<p>In the United States July 4th means Independence Day. November 5th in Britain is Guy Fawkes Day. July 14th to a Parisian means the storming of the Bastille. For the people of Trinidad and Tobago, two events carry enough significance to be remembered by their dates alone. Trinidadians speak of 'July 27th' and 'November 19th' in hushed tones. Not even 'the 51', the West Indies cricket team's lowest Test score (against Australia in 1998) is accorded that respectful dread. </p> <p>On 27 July, 1990, the self-styled Imam Yasin Abu Bakr led 113 young black Muslims in an armed uprising that killed two dozen. The insurrectionists firebombed police headquarters, stormed the Parliament building and the only television station at the time, took the prime minister, members of Parliament and journalists hostage and precipitated a six-day crisis that paralysed the nation in a state of emergency and caused \u00a36 million of damage to public buildings and twice that to private property. </p> <p>And, on 19 November the year before, the national football team, needing only a home draw to qualify for the 1990 World Cup finals, were knocked out of the competition by the US by a single goal. In a dangerously overcrowded National Stadium, 30,000 calypso-singing, jumping, wildly cheering spectators clad in red were stunned into a silence from which they are only now emerging. Ten years later, it is difficult to say which event traumatised the nation more. </p> <p>Certainly Trinidad and Tobago foot ball seems to have recovered better than the nation itself. This year, scoring 13 goals and conceding none (and that without Shaka Hislop in the net), Trinidad and Tobago needed only four of their first six matches to qualify for the second round of the 2002 World Cup. Mexico, the leading team in the group on paper, have had the best performance against T &amp; T so far, going down by only 1-0. Canada lost by two at home and twice that many in Port of Spain; and, the day before the West Indies cricket team lost the Test series 3-1 to England at the Kennington Oval, Trinidad and Tobago's football team hit Panama for six at the Queen's Park Oval. </p> <p>Team spirit, under new coach Ian Porterfield, is so high that it is unlikely the now available Hislop will replace his substitute, Clayton Ince, in the next round, and perhaps not at all. Dwight Yorke left Aston Villa saying that, since he would probably never play in the World Cup for his country, he would have to consider Manchester United his personal summit. He looks likely to be eating his words in Japan. </p> <p>Yorke's rise is counterpoised by his friend (and former under-14 national football team colleague) Brian Lara's slow sinking from excellence under the overwhelming weight of a mediocre cricket team. Yorke is not a greater footballer than Lara is a cricketer; but fortune favours the lucky and the man who holds the two highest batting world records finds himself in a sport that is, at the moment, simply not as striking. </p> <p>The Queen's Park Oval was sold out for the games against Panama and Canada. Not even one-day cricket, with ticket prices half those of the football games, achieves that regularly any more. The one Test match played in Trinidad this year (against Zimbabwe, a game the West Indies very nearly lost) attracted crowds sparse enough to embarrass a secondary schools league final. </p> <p>In international prestige, which matters more than anything else to the West Indian, who scorns percolated Blue Mountain coffee for Nescafe instant, individual island football has whipped West Indies cricket. Jamaica captured the hearts of the world (if not a single point) when the Reggae Boyz got to the first round in France in 1998. The president of Concacaf (North and Central American Continental Football Federation), Austin 'Jack' Warner, is from Trinidad and even the most sceptical of his critics was impressed by seeing Kevin Keegan and Franz Beckenbauer each giving coaching sessions in Trinidad to try to win votes for his respective country's 2006 World Cup bid. </p> <p>The nation has not done as well, spiritually or materially, as the football team. The Muslim rebels were released from prison by a local judge and, by the time Trinidad and Tobago's highest court of appeal, the Privy Council, sitting at 11 Downing Street, eventually ruled that the rebels ought not to have been let go, they felt it would not be fair to re-arrest them. The law-abiding citizens of Trinidad and Tobago thus had to come to terms with watching the 114 men they saw shoot up the place on television get out of jail free. Two years ago, another local judge held that the Muslim rebels were entitled to compensation for a Muslim school and supermarket burned down by policemen out of vengeance. </p> <p>Politically, the ten years between 1990 and today have torn the nation's soul. The judiciary is in open conflict with a government led by a lifelong Marxist who now plays golf with the business elite he five years ago labelled 'the parasitic oligarchy'. The prime minister's heir apparent, the present attorney-general and the former president of the T &amp; T Human Rights Bureau, somehow squares his moral conviction against the death penalty with the direct personal supervision of the hanging of nine men in a single weekend. </p> <p>Apart from having a local girl named Miss Universe in 1998, Trinidad and Tobago has had little to celebrate in the last decade, particularly from West Indies cricket. The territory had only one player on the team last year and, when Brian Lara relinquished the captaincy, there was no Trinidadian at all. The economy is growing but so are the ranks of the poor, with nearly 40 per cent of the population living below the United Nations poverty line measured at the earning rate of one American dollar a day. Like everywhere else in the world, in Port of Spain, the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting children. </p> <p>Hope of short-term glory lies with football, where the petty inter-island rivalry that devastates West Indies cricket is, somehow, not a factor. Trinidad and Tobago supported Jamaica in the last World Cup and, should only Trinidad and Tobago qualify this time around, Jamaicans are sure to cheer the Soca Boyz ahead of the teams West Indians generally support, Brazil and Argentina. </p> <p>Ten years ago, when qualification for the World Cup finals was more likely, and seven days before the last match itself, the government of the day threw a week-long celebration called Red Week without a hint of irony. </p> <p>Immediately before kick-off, the players were taken on a motorcade from one end of the island to the other and displayed to the adoring masses in an orchestrated demonstration of spontaneous appreciation that would have made Stalin jealous. The result of that premature frenzied festivity was 1-0 to the US, and the silence of the shell-shocked for a decade. </p> <p>Today, though they are quick to cheer each success of the World Cup team so far, Trinidadians and Tobagonians are slow to be talking about Japan 2002 the way they did about Italy 1990. There may be several red-letter days ahead but there will be no Red Week. </p> <p>The events of November 19th and July 27th are inextricably tied up in the minds and hearts of the people of Trinidad and Tobago; indeed, the national team were actually playing an international match when the Muslim rebels set off the first bombs of their coup attempt. Trinidadians may do well to remind themselves of the fates of the two teams that went out on the two dates: the Imam and his 113 of July 27 were freed; the eleven on the team of Red Week were left in tears on the field on November 19. And, just last week, with Dwight Yorke's future at Manchester United perhaps coming under a raised eyebrow, the Imam collected a cheque from the Attorney General for TT$1.5 million, the first instalment of the muslims' TT$12million claim for the damage done to their property.</p>",
  "Serendipity is the most popular word in the English language, according to a poll conducted by the London Literary Festival. A term redolent of happy chance seems an odd choice for a nation with an anxiety complex the size of Cardiff, the flashpoint for the latest outbreak of mass hysteria. <p>On Tuesday, Warren Moore, drivetime presenter of the radio station, Red Dragon, made a facetious remark hinting at renewed petrol blockades. In normal times, his comment might have registered only with a Welsh hill farmer or two, a few, late-season pony-trekkers and a posse of longhorn sheep. Instead, countrywide queues built up, pumps ran dry, fuel replenishment was put back by a week and the Sun demanded: 'Have we all gone mad?' </p> <p>Apparently we have. As the phantom scare faded, more details emerged about the previous week's panic-buying. Somerfield, the high-street supermarket chain, reported that its customers did not restrict their shopping sprees to aisle wars over bread and milk. In addition, sales of deodorant, shampoo and shaving foam rose astronomically. Washing powder and cleaning fluids evaporated from the shelves as the public stockpiled against a pristine Armageddon. Had things got a micron more desperate, we would no doubt have been hoarding any mutant turnip left unsquelched by Lord Melchett and his newly-legitimised Greenpeace crop-tramplers. </p> <p>What to deduce from such irrational behaviour, beyond the fact that the bathroom cabinets of Middle Wallop are now stocked with sufficient anti-perspirant to sanitise every armpit in Mexico City? The social psychologists' explanation is simple. Collective behaviour is the glue of community and therefore a good thing until it is subverted by self-interest. Mass action of the me-first kind flourishes when people lack trust in central authority. Rumour and fear are sparked by lack of faith in official pronouncements. </p> <p>In an age of doubt and slick communication, the country prefers to take its cue from Wayne of Red Dragon rather than from a Prime Minister whose recent strategy on calming national panic seemed hardly more effective than that of a commuter shouting 'Sarin' on a Tokyo tube. But the drift in public faith is not primarily the fault of Blair, who, for all his vast majority, collected fewer votes in 1997 than Major did in 1992. Voter apathy means, in turn, that the parliamentary spectrum cannot reflect the wishes of the self-disenfranchised, who register their protest through other outlets. Hence what Steve Reicher, editor of the British Journal of Social Psychology, calls 'a crisis of democratic representation'. </p> <p>Or, as Martin Luther King put it: 'Crowds are the voice of the oppressed.' Mass movements, even with their overtones of panic and menace, are, at best, the engine of social change. The trouble is that the oppressed are a motley bunch with more or less righteous causes and justifiable tactics. From the Chartists to Seattle, the history of direct action is littered with the laudable and the loutish. All such crusades are cloaked in the one-size-fits-all mantle of worthy struggle and just ends. Group power of any sort teeters uneasily between the mild and the mad. </p> <p>So what provoked the most recent cocktail of protest and panic? Daniel Bell, the American sociologist and the father of the Third Way, would say that the deferred gratification of early capitalist production has yielded to instant fixes and grab-it-all hedonism. Whether panicking Persil-hoarders or Coutts-card fashion victims scouring the planet for the last pair of must-have Prada slingbacks, we are all mad consumers now. </p> <p>David Howell, in his new book, The Edge of Now, argues that current unrest will be stilled once we learn to love the global marketplace and rediscover the Victorian conflation of commerce and virtue. Perhaps so, but there never was a halcyon age of accord. The link between protest and the market has been going on since nineteenth-century food rioters discovered that an end to feudal structures equalled dearer grain. But in a modern democracy, the cult of direct action, only partly targeted on financial concerns, looks increasingly bizarre. Blankets of flowers for Diana, petrol bombs for the alleged paedophiles of the Paulsgrove estate, fox-hunters on the warpath, guerrilla gardeners trashing London: is this the normal cut-and-thrust of focus groups unleashed or a signal of something more sinister? </p> <p>Mob-mourning for Diana was always a leading indicator that the flood tide of British sentiment, if skewed to other ends, might turn nasty. The paedophile protest, conducted in the name of innocent children, proved just how vicious. </p> <p>Politicians, enjoined to 'listen', a synonym for 'cave in', have, at least until the petrol d\u00e9b\u00e2cle, riskily preferred emollience to condemnation when dealing with special interest groups. But stifling uproar can be a zero sum game, particularly when a febrile British public behaves as if, give or take a few screaming owls and crying crickets, we are all participants in the last act of Macbeth. </p> <p>Implicit in this mood is a justifiable suspicion that something odd is happening to democracy. When peaceful protesters against the Chinese President are bundled into police vans and anti-paedophile vigilantes are humoured, something is awry. When an unelected House Of Lords forces the retention of Section 28, its obduracy looks suspiciously like mob rule decked in ermine. And when Lord Melchett and 27 allies charged with criminal damage walk free from Norfolk Crown Court after admitting destroying a GM crop, it is truly time to reach for one's wallet. </p> <p>The verdict effectively means that hardliners, certain that the public cheers for them, will feel freer to wreak havoc with scientists' legitimate crop trials and besiege beleaguered farmers newly returned from manning the petrol barricades. This vicious circle of protest points up the power vacuum afflicting government. Although not responsible for the Melchett jury's call, politicians set the scene for clemency in failing to make the case that GM crops, potentially a vital future resource, should be properly tested. Instead, the debate became mired in charges of corporate exploitation and in a suspicion, undented so far, that the public, still understandably horrified by BSE, was being lined up for the vegetarian version. </p> <p>And so the crop protesters will be back. A neo-Luddite band emboldened now to consider themselves beyond the reach of the law, they are the latest ragtag army so easily conscripted in a post-industrial Britain where ideology falters and power belongs to any self-interest group with a mood-grabbing campaign and a wish to bend the Government to its will. The clout once applied by state or unions is mutating into what E.P. Thompson called 'collective bargaining by riot'. Public uprisings do occasionally pitch it right, as in the outcry for more money for the health service, but in the main, they specialise in the selfish, the blinkered and the vindictive. </p> <p>None of that might matter, except for the dangerous gulf between the brilliance of the strategy of internet-age direct action and the vacuity of its aims. The recent overall gain of twentieth-century protest, and its sideline of panic, is as follows: a stream of sex offenders driven underground, a freer hand to block legitimate scientific progress and a stash of superfluous shower gel. </p> <p>Such a tally might have puzzled those, from Luther King to Pankhurst, who made direct action the accelerator of social progress. Today, it seems more like its drag anchor. That is why Tony Blair's toughness towards petrol protesters is right. And why William Hague's moment of bonding with the 'fine, upstanding' citizens of the picket line will prove to be less than serendipitous.</p>",
  "<p>It is one of the deadliest new viruses to have emerged on the planet, and in the past few months it has begun to terrorise a growing list of victim nations. West Nile Fever looks set to become a global threat for the twenty-first century. </p> <p>Last month the disease killed 12 Israelis; France and Jordan reported outbreaks; and US scientists warned the disease has probably spread across the nation, threatening new eruptions in areas such as the Gulf coast. </p> <p>The bird-borne disease - which can trigger fatal inflammations of the brain, or encephalitis - caused panic when it broke out in America last year, killing seven New Yorkers. It was the first outbreak in the Western hemisphere. Researchers are still arguing over the cause, with some putting the blame on an infected bird that had been imported from Israel, while others said mosquitoes on airliners had spread the disease. </p> <p>The disease, spread from birds to humans via mosquitoes, returned to America's East Coast, with cases being identified in New York, New Jersey and Delaware. 'The disease is now firmly established in the US,' Dr Ernie Gould of the Institute of Virology and Environmental Microbiology, Oxford,said. 'It is there for good now. It is hard to see how on earth they can get rid of it.' </p> <p>The threat of West Nile has so alarmed Canadian health authorities they have decided to post chickens along its US border. Coops are being built from Saskatchewan to Atlantic Canada, creating a poultry version of Hadrian's Wall. The birds inside are scheduled to be tested regularly for West Nile viral antibodies, the aim being to give scientists an early warning of an impending outbreak. </p> <p>Such measures probably will prove futile. John Rappole and colleagues at the Smithsonian Institution's zoo in Front Royal, Virginia, have just reported, in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases , that they now believe more than 70 migratory species of bird, including ducks, starlings, terns and gulls, can carry the West Nile Fever virus, creating vast squadrons of avian hosts that can ferry the disease around the globe with impunity. </p> <p>'The virus is probably in every corner of North America by now,' as well as parts of South America, Rappole told New Scientist . The virus is usually harmless in healthy people but can cause deadly inflammations in the brains and spinal cords of immune suppressed or elderly patients. Most of those killed in the Israeli outbreak were in their eighties, for example. But although the disease has caused alarm in the West, it is by no means a new affliction to our planet. It is endemic from the Cape of Good Hope to Cairo. More than 80 per cent of Eygptians are infected at some time, though only older people run the risk of encephalitis. The disease is also widespread in the Middle East and India, and has appeared regularly in many parts of southern Europe. </p> <p>Three years ago, an outbreak of West Nile Fever, which is caused by a member of a group of viruses called flaviviruses, affected more than 500 people around Bucharest, Romania. More than 50 died. Other outbreaks occurred in southern Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Italy. </p> <p>So why is the disease spreading? In many cases, human activities - new dams and irrigation works - are helping mosquitoes breed and spread West Nile, say scientists. Global warming may also be having an effect. </p> <p>'It is without doubt a nasty illness,' said neurologist Dr Tom Solomon, of Liverpool University. 'But we should not go overboard about it. Until last year no one knew about West Nile Fever, even though there had been several previous outbreaks in south Europe. It wasn't until New York was hit that the West gave a damn. Now we can't stop talking about it. </p> <p>'The situation is particularly ironic when you look at Japanese encephalitis, a virtually identical bird-born disease caused by a sibling virus. It affects more than 50,000 people a year in Asia, and kills 15,000 of them. It is much nastier, but we don't notice it because it has not yet touched the Western hemisphere. </p> <p>'In general, though, flaviviruses are going to be a real problem. We have not seen everything they can do yet. They are rapidly evolving entities and they are likely to adapt to all sorts of new ecological niches.' </p> <p>Indeed, flaviviruses have already adapted to cooler climates by abandoning mosquitoes and starting to use ticks as their intermediary hosts. One such illness has already appeared in Britain: louping-ill fever, which can decimate grouse populations and has triggered outbreaks of non-fatal meningo-encephalitis in humans. </p> <p>Additional research by Lucy Pogson</p>",
  "<p>Not very long ago, William Aikens, a former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said: 'When the oil price rises above $30 a barrel, Saddam Hussein will be treated like Mother Teresa.' His statement sums up the indisputable connection between petroleum price, Iraq (possessing the second-largest oil reserves in the world) and Washington's policy towards Saddam. </p> <p>With Iraq producing 3.6 million barrels per day (bpd), its highest output ever, the removal of a United Nations' ceiling on its petroleum sales in January, and American oil corporations buying up a third of its oil exports, Saddam has become a major player in the market. </p> <p>This was acknowledged implicitly by America when Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced recently that Washington would not use force to compel Iraq to accept inspectors of the newly formed UN Monitoring and Ongoing Verification and Inspection Commission (Unmovic). She then joined the UN ambassadors of Russia, France and China in urging Unmovic chief, Hans Blix, not to force the issue. </p> <p>This has enabled Saddam to become active, rather than reactive, in his foreign affairs. Hence his recent claim that by carrying out horizontal drilling near the Kuwait-Iraq border, Kuwait was stealing 300,000 barrels per day of Iraqi petroleum. </p> <p>Hence, too, his letter to the UN Security Council holding Saudi Arabia responsible for the losses that Baghdad suffered when Riyadh closed the oil pipeline from southern Iraq to the Saudi Red Sea port of Yanbo in August 1990. </p> <p>Saddam's aim in putting Kuwait and Saudi Arabia - big petroleum producers - on the defensive is to destabilise the oil market and spike up the price. He knows well how tight the current world petroleum market is - thanks chiefly to thriving economies all around the globe - and how vulnerable the US is on the issue of oil imports. </p> <p>Today 60 per cent of the 19 million barrels of oil Americans consume daily comes from abroad, double the levels seen in 1983. And the trend is set to continue. </p> <p>In the Nineties, oil output in the US declined by 15 per cent, while consumption rose by 11 per cent. With less than 5 per cent of the world population, America consumes 25 per cent of world oil output. It sucks up all the petroleum exports of Canada, Mexico and Venezuela. And it is becoming increasingly dependent on imports from the Gulf region, including Iraq. </p> <p>As soon as Iraq accepted the UN-administered oil-for-food scheme in December 1996, allowing it to sell $2 billion worth of petroleum in six months to buy food and medicine, Washington let it be known that US companies were free to buy Iraqi oil. </p> <p>And they did - for two years. Then, enraged by Operation Desert Fox, the Penta gon's 100-hour blitzkrieg against Iraq in mid-December 1998, Saddam ordered that no Iraqi oil be sold to American companies. </p> <p>But that did not happen. Indeed, according to the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, Iraq emerged as the fastest-growing source of US petroleum imports in 1999. </p> <p>US companies bought about a third of their Iraqi oil imports through foreign intermediaries. Their tankers loaded the commodity at an Iraqi oil terminal and sailed directly to American ports, often in the Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>'The Chevrons and the Exxons of this world have to buy [Iraqi oil] from the Russians, the French and the Chinese traders,' said Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. </p> <p>Saddam is well aware of the shipment of Iraqi oil directly to the US. 'That doesn't bother him,' said Vahe Petrossian, a London-based oil expert. 'By banning direct sales to American companies, Saddam deprived them of their trading profits. These now go to the middlemen from countries friendly with Baghdad - Russia, France and China.' </p> <p>Part of the reason for US corporations seeking out Iraqi crude is that an American law prohibits them from purchasing oil from Iran, Opec's second largest producer, whose output is on a par with Iraq's. </p> <p>All this is part of Washington's Dual Containment pol icy towards Tehran and Baghdad, adopted in May 1993. But the policy has been in tatters for the past four years, a fact the Clinton administration refuses to recognise. </p> <p>When it comes to repairing Iraq' rundown petroleum industry, the European subsidiaries of US oil equipment firms are in the forefront. Since mid-1998, making bids through their foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, more than a dozen US corporations have signed tens of millions of dollars'-worth of contracts with Iraq for oil-producing equipment . </p> <p>With the UN allowing Iraq to spend an average of $100m a month on repairing its petroleum industry, the pickings are rich. </p> <p>In July, Unmovic announced with much fanfare that its 44 inspectors from 19 countries were to take a month-long training course at New York's Columbia University to familiarise themselves with the historical, legal, administrative and political aspects of inspections and monitoring, and to become 'sensitive' to Iraqi culture. </p> <p>The snag is that Iraq has refused to accept last December's UN Security Council Resolution 1284, setting up Unmovic. So when Unmovic boss Blix said in August that a small team of his inspectors were ready to go to Iraq, his progress report was received with embarrassment rather than enthusiasm by the US. Half of the Unmovic inspectors have returned home. </p> <p>In the words of Henry Kissinger, a former US Secretary of State: 'Countries do not have friends or foes; they have interests.' And no interest is higher or more important in America than to keep gas-guzzling cars running, and homes and offices heated in winter. </p> <p>If that requires supping with the devil - renamed Saddam - so be it. </p> <p><strong>Rolling out the barrels: the supply chain</strong></p> <p><strong> Crude</strong> <br> When the price of oil was only $10 a barrel, in early 1998, Opec countries dependent on foreign earnings tried to bump it up to around $20 by cutting production to 2.6 million barrels a day in March and June. Nothing happened. They tried again with a 1.7 million cut in March: the price soared to $30 early this year. </p> <p>US pressure and concern that high prices were not in Opec's interest led to three production increases this year - 1.7 million barrels a day in March, 700,000 in June and 800,000 in September. But the price has not budged, because: </p> <p>\u0095 The shambolic quota system is inexact and often broken by Opec members. </p> <p>\u0095 Demand for oil is rising. </p> <p>\u0095 Crude is only one link in a complicated oil supply chain. </p> <p><strong> Shipping</strong> <br>The next link is shipping crude to market. The price charged by tanker owners to do this had gone up from $17,000 a day in September last year to $73,000 a day last month, says shipping broker Clarkson. This has raised shipping costs per barrel from around 60 cents to $2.60. The rise has been driven by a rebound after the Asian crisis, the scrapping of ships and demand for safer double-hulled vessels. </p> <p><strong> Refining</strong> <br>Next comes refining crude into products from petrol to heating oil. Refiners in Europe and the US were running below capacity last January. Now they are almost flat out, according to the Centre for Global Energy Studies. But as they have raised capacity, demand has risen, too. In the spring, US petrol stocks were down to 25 days. A massive rise in capacity had failed to lift that beyond 23 days by August. The result: higher prices at the pumps. The petrol problem is at last receding, only to be replaced by a similar difficulty over winter heating oil. </p> <p>\u0095 Dilip Hiro is the author of 'Dictionary of the Middle East', published by Macmillan, price \u00a320.</p>",
  "<p>An international game of pass the parcel is emerging this weekend about who or what is to blame for the high oil price and what action, if any, could make it fall. </p> <p>Fears about the high cost of oil and its downstream derivatives are driving a high-stakes game of geopolitics, involving the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the US presidential elections, and futures market traders in New York and London. Black gold is high on the agenda in Prague for worried leaders at the G7 summit of industrialised nations. </p> <p>In the US a combination of economic and political effects led to the unprecedented release of oil reserves by President Bill Clinton. </p> <p>The wild card in the pack is this week's Opec heads of state meeting in Caracas - only the second such gathering in the organisation's history. The timing could not be better, coming as the cartel thrusts itself back on to the world stage from the brink of irrelevance, and in the immediate wake of the US's intervention. </p> <p>So what can make oil cheaper? Not surprisingly, it depends who you ask: it's Opec or it's extra refining capacity; it's a matter of using strategic reserves, or a question of rectifying the irrational exuberance of futures markets. </p> <p>In Prague the heads of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are fret ting at the prospect of oil shaving fractions of percentage points off world growth, and boosting inflation. The double-headed hydra of high oil prices affecting economies in the long term and voters in the short term was largely unforeseen. The French government is using the G7 meeting to propose an informal summit between the European Union, the US and the oil-producing countries. </p> <p>In the US, oil has become a political issue because of the high prices and because the Republican presidential running mates, George W Bush and Dick Cheney, have strong connections with 'Big Oil'. It was Al Gore, the Democrat candidate, who stirred the pot by getting Clinton to release some of the US's strategic reserve of 571 million barrels. </p> <p>Similar moves from the other G7 nations are now possible. In emergencies a mechanism exists through the International Energy Agency, the energy market watchdog of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, to release portions of the agency's reserve of about 1.2bn barrels. This oil was last used in the Gulf War, and was on standby for millennium computer bug problems. </p> <p>IEA countries could decide to make a co-ordinated intervention to dampen down speculative hysteria. But the notion of high prices as an 'emergency' is unprecedented. For now, efforts are concentrated on the more traditional channels of polite diplomacy to secure a production increase from Opec. </p> <p>William Ramsay, deputy executive director of the IEA, said: 'Frankly, Opec have not shared their agenda with us, though one of the clearest reasons may be to celebrate 40 years of existence.' </p> <p>The world leaders in Prague may be worried, but the Opec guests in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, will be ebullient. The city has been given an extra lick of paint. In the run-up to the summit, a three-month cultural festival featuring Opec member states' work included Kuwaiti art exhibitions and demonstrations of Venezuelan basketry. The meeting is the high point of a process of Opec reconstruction, largely propelled by the feisty Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez. </p> <p>He travelled around the Middle East to deliver personal invitations to the conference, promising to visit Saddam Hussein even if he had to go to Iraq by camel or skateboard. Saddam and Libya's Colonel Gadaffi declined their invitations on security grounds, but the trip and the rhetoric surrounding it caught the eye of oil markets mindful of a possible return of the oil militancy of the mid-Seventies. </p> <p>However, Opec insiders say this should not be seen as a return to the sabre-rattling of that era. 'If Opec then could be considered a rebellious teenager,' its general secretary, Dr Rilwanu Lukman, said last week, 'I am happy to say that now, as its fortieth birthday nears, the organisation has gained the maturity that comes with age.' </p> <p>Opec will attempt to forge stronger links with other oil-producing nations, such as Mexico and Russia. Norway, which is a member of the IEA but has followed Opec output price trends in the past has sent an observer to Caracas. Senior analysts suggest Opec may achieve the spectacular diplomatic coup of admitting Russia to the cartel. </p> <p>If the heads of state really do want to make a difference beyond the diplomatic pomp and circumstance of the summit, they will find the scale and timing of any intervention in the market very difficult to judge. </p> <p>Opec members are notoriously bad at breaking quotas. It is also difficult to tell how other elements in the supply chain, from shipping costs and refining capacity to final demand for oil products, will play out. On top of this, oil markets - including Nymex in New York and London's International Petroleum exchange - are hard to read. Any production rise aimed at pushing the price into the band favoured by economists, Opec and consumers - between $22 and \u00a328 a barrel - is liable to cause a crash. </p> <p>'Opec has increased production this year much more than necessary,' Chavez told Venezuelans on TV last week. </p> <p>He said suggestions that Opec could increase production by 2.2 million barrels per day were exaggerated: the cartel was already producing in excess of world demand. Opec says the high price is not a result of a an oil shortage, but a lack of refinery capacity and futures market speculation. </p> <p>Refineries across the industrialised world are running flat out. Some have been doing so for months, and will have to shut for maintenance in October. If this is the bottleneck, increasing production of crude, or releasing reserves, may ease crude prices in the short term, but it is unlikely to cut the retail cost of petrol and heating oil. </p> <p>The IEA is not convinced. 'The numbers being put around - that Opec took 4 million barrels off the market, have put 3 million back in, and in the meantime demand has increased production by 2 million barrels - speak for themselves. I don't think you can explain the fragility in today's market by futures trading,' says Ramsay. </p> <p>The key to understanding where oil prices may be heading lies in the dark world of the futures markets. The oil market is distorted in such a way that it doesn't pay to store oil. Oil companies, refineries and speculators can make profits by running down their stocks and buying cheaper future supplies. This arises partly because of the uncertain intentions of the global oil market players, from Opec to governments and oil companies. </p> <p>The oil markets are, to use the jargon, 'backwardated'. This means speculators believe supply increases by Opec and changes in global demand will eventually come into balance, bringing the price of oil down from their present dizzy levels. As a result oil on the futures market is cheaper than the current or 'spot' price. </p> <p>If the Opec heads of state make any increase in production, it will have to be finely judged. Analysts believe that to bring the price down, any rise will have to be significant - more than a million barrels per day on top of the 800,000 rise announced earlier this month. </p> <p>However, such an increase is likely to produce a shock similar in scale to that following the March 1999 1.7 million cut, which triggered a massive oil price rise. But this time, of course, prices would slump. </p> <p>That would reverse the current 'backwardated' market, and create conditions of 'contango', where massive current supply puts the spot price below the futures price. </p> <p>Leo Drollas of the Centre for Global Energy Studies says: 'It is highly likely that we will reach contango soon: we will be awash with crude and the spot price will collapse. If I could say when that was I'd be in Monte Carlo. But I'd say it's likely in the first quarter of next year.' </p> <p>Robert Mabro, of the Oxford Institute for Energy studies, says: 'Unfortunately it seems that an oil shock is the only method of correcting these extreme prices, so you bounce back and forth from $10 to $33.' </p> <p>The likelihood of oil price ping-pong prevents Opec from making any production response that will have an impact on the market. </p> <p>In these conditions, a more likely cause of a significant fall in the price is smaller-than-expected demand caused by an exceptionally mild winter. A harsher winter, with everything else equal, will keep the market 'backwardated' and the price high. </p> <p>Industry analysts believe Clinton's intervention could backfire. Refineries will look for every means possible to sell crude from the reserve on the spot market and buy futures - undermining the effect of the reserve oil on product prices. Whether they succeed depends on the price at which the reserve is released, and how effective the US government is at policing abuse. </p> <p>'Refiners are clever,' said one analyst. 'They'll always find a way to beat the system.' </p> <p>There is also a risk that Opec might reverse some of the production increases in response to the unprecedented release of reserves. And then where would we be?</p>",
  "Labour's attempts to fend off a pensions revolt suffered a fresh blow yesterday as a poll revealed overwhelming backing for a rise for all pensioners. <p>More than 90 per cent of the public want a substantial increase in the universal basic state pension, according to the survey for Age Concern and the Transport &amp; General Workers' Union. </p> <p>The findings show Chancellor Gordon Brown's strategy of targeting help at the poorest pensioners, rather than all OAPs regardless of income, has not so far convinced the public. </p> <p>They come amid frantic attempts to avert defeat for the leadership at Labour's annual conference this week. </p> <p>The GMB and T&amp;G unions are now ready to drop demands to link pensions with earnings. But they want a rise in the basic pension. And although the Chancellor has hinted in private that he will be generous in the Budget, he is refusing to give specific details. </p> <p>'The unions want numbers, and they won't get them,' said one government source. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a second potential headache is looming over vouchers for asylum seekers, which have replaced cash handouts to buy food and basic goods. </p> <p>Bill Morris, the T&amp;G leader, has tabled a motion demanding their abolition. He will argue they stigmatise refugees and could incite racist violence. </p> <p>Morris, appalled by seeing asylum seekers forced to queue separately to spend their weekly \u00a326.34 and being refused change, is threatening to release a dossier of evidence backing his case, including private advice from civil servants. </p> <p>While both issues arouse strong feelings among delegates, pensions are more significant electorally. </p> <p>Tony Blair and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott will try to soothe ruffled feathers at a trade union liaison committee dinner tonight in Brighton. </p> <p>But the crucial negotiations are expected to take place tomorrow, particularly with Morris, who is privately anxious not to kick the Government when it is down. The NEC, Labour's ruling body, will meet tomorrow but its statement is unlikely to produce any new commitments on pensions. </p> <p>Government offers on the table include hiking the so-called minimum income guarantee - made up of basic state pension plus a means-tested top-up for the worst off - or adjusting thresholds at which pensioners become eligible for the extra help. </p> <p>Brown and social security secretary Alistair Darling believe an important principle is at stake. Treasury sources insisted the Chancellor would not be budging and was 'quietly confident' of riding out the storm. </p> <p>But rebel unions want more cash for all OAPs regardless of income, arguing that means-testing is offensive and potentially disastrous electorally. </p> <p>However, Treasury sources said there would be no change to Friday's statement, which promised rising prosperity for all OAPs and 'transitional arrangements' until the introduction of a new pensioner tax credit in 2003. </p> <p>If the earnings link had not been broken in 1979, the basic pension would now be worth \u00a397.45, not \u00a365.50 for a single person. </p> <p>The majority of the 2,000 poll respondents said it should be over \u00a3100.</p>",
  "THE Ulster Volunteer Force - engaged in a murderous feud with rival loyalists - has warned the Irish government that any attempt to impose joint authority over Northern Ireland will be met with bomb attacks in the republic. <p>The UVF also insisted that its confrontation with an Ulster Defence Association faction in Belfast's Shankill Road was far from over. </p> <p>A senior UVF commander told The Observer that, while the organisation was pre-occupied with the feud, it was monitoring the deteriorating political situation closely. If David Trimble was ousted as First Minister and Dublin pressed for an alternative to the Good Friday Agreement on the lines of joint rule over Northern Ireland, the UVF would review its ceasefire. </p> <p>Ulster Unionist officials admitted yesterday that Trimble could soon face a vote of no confidence after his party's shock by-election defeat in South Antrim. John Taylor, the UUP's deputy leader, also warned that, if the Northern Ireland Secretary met nationalist demands to implement the Patten report on policing in full, this would be the signal for Ulster Unionists to withdraw from the power-sharing Executive. </p> <p>'There is no way we are ever going to back to the kind of tit-for-tat sectarian cam paign we saw in the past,' the UVF leader said. 'If there is to be resumption in the future caused by Dublin pushing things too far, then the organisation will be looking across the border.' </p> <p>The threat of bombs over the border in response to joint authority is more potent than ever before, given the stockpiles of weapons and explosives being uncovered in security operations aimed at clamping down on the loyal ist feuding in Belfast. Even within UVF ranks, the most pro-Agreement of the loyalist terror groups, there is growing disillusion with the direction of the political process. </p> <p>The RUC has found large amounts of plastic and home- made explosives alongside home-made mortars, rockets and grenades since the feud between the UVF and 'C' Company of the UDA in West Belfast began last August. The explosives used to destroy the Shankill Road offices of the UDA's political wing, the Ulster Democratic Party, last week were a compound of commercial powergel explosive and a new type of plastic explosive similar to Semtex. The UVF are understood to have acquired the plastic explosive from Eastern Europe. </p> <p>The arms finds in the Greater Shankill indicate that both loyalist terror groups have continued to smuggle arms and explosives into Northern Ireland despite their ceasefires and public support for the Agreement. </p> <p>The UVF commander stressed that the organisation continued to back the Agreement and wanted the peace process to survive. But there was increasing concern that, if Trimble and subsequently the power-sharing Executive fell, nationalists on both sides of the border would push for joint Dublin-London rule over the North. </p> <p>Asked about the likelihood of an early resolution to the feud, he said: 'Until the UDA national leadership takes control of \"C\" Company, then the chances of ending this are remote. </p> <p>'Even if it does end, the bitterness caused by people being expelled from their homes will last for generations. There is no mood for compromise among ordinary volunteers.' </p> <p>The UDA's leadership has so far rejected calls for it to distance itself from 'C' Company, whose members are confined to the Lower Shankill area.</p>",
  "The Russian-made rocket propelled grenade fired at MI6's headquarters on the Thames caused only minimal material destruction but produced maximum political damage. The Real IRA 'spectacular' resulted in a broken window, a scarred building and traffic and rail chaos around Vauxhall Cross and Waterloo station. <p>The political fallout of the RPG attack has been enormous. It was the first major propaganda coup for the dissident republicans. A daring sortie on such an obvious symbol of the British establishment will have impressed many young disaffected republicans contemplating joining anti-ceasefire terror groups. The MI6 attack will undoubtedly be a useful recruiting tool for the Real IRA. </p> <p>The initial political target of the Real IRA's third and most spectacular strike in London, though, was David Trimble and the faction of his Ulster Unionist Party that still supports the Good Friday Agreement. The rocket was fired on Wednesday night fewer than 12 hours before polls opened in the South Antrim parliamentary by-election. </p> <p>An intensification of the Real IRA's terror campaign in Britain would simply confirm the fears of many UUP voters in the constituency that the Agreement had not brought about the peace and stability Tony Blair and Trimble had promised it would. </p> <p>Combined with the ongoing loyalist feud, many unionists in South Antrim clearly concluded that Blair's promises about peace and no terrorist representatives in government were not worth the paper they were written on after the Agreement was signed in Easter 1998. </p> <p>Judging by the South Antrim result, a stunning victory for Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists in what was once regarded as the UUP's second safest seat in Northern Ireland, the Real IRA's timing was perfect. The Rev William McCrea, the DUP's bible-thumping, gospel singing candidate, overturned the UUP's 16,000 majority. </p> <p>Trimble's allies and later Peter Mandelson attempted to put a spin on the size of the defeat, blaming voter apathy, the rain on Thursday and that old chestnut, the media, for McCrea's triumph. The turnout was remarkably low by Northern Ireland standards - just 43 per cent of the electorate bothered to vote. McCrea's majority over his main rival, the former British Airways publicity director David Burnside was a mere 822 votes. Yet none of this can disguise the fact that the result is a severe slap in the face not only for Trimble but also Blair. </p> <p>According to UUP members canvassing for Burnside there were two 'killer issues' confronting them on the doorsteps - anger over the Patten reforms of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the perception that Blair had gone back on his pledges, particularly his promise that parties linked to paramilitaries (ie Sinn Fein) could not sit in government until there was actual decommissioning. </p> <p>Most unionists see the ditching of the RUC name, the dumping of the harp and crown cap badge and Patten's proposal that there be some local political control over the new police force as unacceptable sops to Sinn Fein and an insult to the 323 officers killed during the Troubles. South Antrim contains a number of Protestant middle-class redoubts populated by serving and retired police officers. </p> <p>One UUP canvasser summed up the attitude of this crucial 'police constituency' in South Antrim: 'They said they would either vote for McCrea just to register a protest against Patten and Blair or else not turn up to vote at all. They said they felt sorry for Trimble, that he had been betrayed by the Prime Minister.' </p> <p>The British Government tried to put a brave face on a terrible setback. Peter Mandelson insisted that while the result indicated 'some unease' within the unionist community too much was being made of McCrea's victory. </p> <p>'If you infer anything from result, it is that faced with the choice between two anti-agreement unionists, many unionists chose to stay at home and not vote at all,' he told reporters at his residence in Hillsborough castle on Friday night. </p> <p>The liberal non-sectarian Alliance Party repeated the mantra claiming that pro-Agreement unionists had no one to vote for because David Burnside had declared he no longer supported the Good Friday deal. Alliance candidate David Ford however failed to mention that had his party not stood then the bulk of the 2,003 votes they received would probably have gone to the UUP and kept McCrea out. </p> <p>Given the reaction of senior UUP figures, Mandelson's assertion that the result does not damage the Agreement sounds like wishful thinking. John Taylor, the UUP deputy leader and MP for Strangford, is regarded as the weather vane of Ulster Unionism. If Taylor turns against the Trimble project then the majority of the party, including that critical band of wavering sceptics, will follow suit. </p> <p>Yesterday Taylor condemned any attempt to challenge Trimble's leadership but warned that the UUP's continued participation in the power-sharing executive at Stormont was under review. </p> <p>Taylor cited the period directly after the UUP annual conference on 7 October as make or break time for the Northern Ireland government. The British Government will publish the final draft of the Bill on policing reforms which unionists suspect has been scheduled after the UUP conference to enable Mandelson to placate Seamus Mallon, the SDLP deputy leader, who wants Patten implemented in full. </p> <p>John Taylor said: 'David Trimble's leadership is excellent and the party would be very very foolish to try and replace him at such a critical time. However, the breaking point is coming for us soon. If the Policing Bill leaves the RUC irrevocably damaged then I would say that this is the time to pull out of the Executive. There is no sense in having a situation where the Ulster Unionist Party is going to fall into electoral oblivion. If nationalists insist on getting their way entirely on policing then they will have done irreparable damage to the Belfast Agreement. They are pushing unionists too far.' </p> <p>The UUP deputy leader's remarks hint to a possible strategy ahead for the party that falls short of ditching Trimble. The Ulster Unionists will use the threat of the DUP and other anti-agreement unionist forces eclipsing them to extract more concessions on policing from the British Government. </p> <p>Even those firmly in the No camp, such as the Lagan Valley MP Jeffrey Donaldson, are known to be reluctant to organise a coup d'etat against Trimble. The Observer has learnt that a number of UUP MPs have approached Donaldson over the weekend urging him to put his name forward. One plan they floated to him was that the Rev Martin Smyth, the South Belfast MP, would offer to stand as a caretaker leader until after next year's expected general election and then be replaced by Donaldson. </p> <p>Smyth came close to defeating Trimble in a leadership challenge earlier this year when he received 47 per cent of the votes from the party's ruling body, the Ulster Unionist Council. But the young pretender to Trimble's throne is thought to be wary of a Smyth-Donaldson ticket, preferring instead to push forward a motion calling on the party to pull out of the Executive until the IRA hands over guns and bombs. </p> <p>As for Trimble himself, the UUP leader and First Minister insists he will fight on. He still believes the Agreement is more resilient than his internal opponents are making out. Yet Trimble must be mindful of recent history, particularly his own path to power. </p> <p>Five years ago his predecessor, Lord Molyneaux, blamed voter apathy for his party's defeat in the North Down by-election at the hands of the most articulate sceptic of the peace process, Robert McCartney. Following McCartney's triumph, Molyneaux attributed the low poll (38.8 per cent) to the fact that North Down had suf fered the least from 'terrorist savagery' charging that the affluent class in Bangor, Cultra and other rich corners of the constituency had forsaken unionists living on the border. After Thursday's routing by the DUP, Trimble also blamed apathetic Ulster Unionist supporters for letting McCrea snatch the seat. </p> <p>Trimble would do well to remember that just months after Molyneaux made his gaffe about North Down, he was forced to step down as party leader.</p>",
  "A gun-toting Yardie gangster who threatened to shoot three people in a road rage incident was being accompanied by an undercover police officer who could not intervene, it has been revealed. <p>The incident, which took place in broad daylight on the streets of central London, is documented in a new book about Scotland Yard's covert operations unit, known as SO10. In a second twist, it has emerged that the gunman had actually been brought to London by the Metropolitan Police as part of a scheme to gather more information about Yardies in the capital. </p> <p>He was paid 'lifestyle' expenses of \u00a3500 per week, given a mobile phone and a two-year-old Golf GTi to drive. He was booked into a plush hotel but later moved to a two-bedroomed flat in Docklands with a monthly rental of almost \u00a31,000. All his expenses - rent, clothes, food and drink - were settled weekly by Scotland Yard. </p> <p>The revelation is certain to fan the flames of controversy that have dogged police attempts to tackle black organised crime. </p> <p>According to Philip Etienne, the undercover officer assigned to escort Skank during his first two months in London, the gangster was one of a number of known criminals specially imported to provide information about Yardie crime. The road rage incident confirmed his suspicions that such men were almost impossible to control. </p> <p>'I was driving down a narrow road near Dean Street when a Jeep appeared coming in the other direction. I stopped and went to reverse to let them get by but Skank knocked my hand away and insisted that we wait until they moved. Eventually the driver, a young woman, came out to complain and Skank just ripped into her, insulting everything about her. There were two other guys in the Jeep and they came over, looking for a fight. Skank jumped out, reached for a gun hidden in the folds of his jacket and threatened to shoot unless they moved.' </p> <p>Etienne could do nothing while playing the part of a gangster; luckily the Jeep driver gave in. Skank later brought a bodyguard from Jamaica at police expense and he moved into the Docklands flat. The operation was abandoned a few months later and both men vanished, leaving unpaid bills. </p> <p>Bringing Skank to London was an extension of a scheme Scotland Yard adopted in the early Nineties when it was recognised that only true Jamaicans known in criminal circles were able to mingle freely with the Yardie gangs. </p> <p>In 1994, Delroy Denton, a Yardie arrested while entering the country illegally, was persuaded to become an informer. He was released into the community while the authorities considered his application for political asylum. Denton had a history of extreme violence in Jamaica, including the ice-pick murder of a prostitute. In the 11 months after his release, Denton was accused of raping a 15-year-old schoolgirl and then jailed for life for raping and murdering Marcia Lawes, a 24-year-old mother of two in Brixton. </p> <p>The Infiltrators by Philip Etienne and Martin Maynard with Tony Thompson is published by Michael Joseph on 28 September, price \u00a315.99</p>",
  "A sudden rise in the number of illegal female circumcisions being carried out in Britain has raised alarm and could lead to a review of current legislation. <p>The Observer has learnt that an all-party parliamentary group looking into the practice will recommend a tightening of the law. In particular, it wants to close a legal loophole that allows girls to be sent abroad for circumcision. The report will also recommend that a national survey should be carried out to determine the scale of the problem and seek more government funding for projects to combat the practice. </p> <p>Researchers believe more than 3,000 young girls in Britain may be being mutilated each year, a sharp increase resulting from a recent influx of refugees from the Horn of Africa, where female circumcision is commonplace. </p> <p>Though most girls are sent abroad, the crude operations are increasingly performed at home, often during school holidays to give the children time to recover and escape the notice of teachers. </p> <p>The illegality of the procedure means researchers and activists meet a wall of silence in the refugee communities. 'Nobody will ever tell you they sent their children abroad for circumcision, but it is known that they do do it,' said Zeinab Mohamed, who has studied the Somali community in Manchester. </p> <p>The people who carry out the operations are nearly always members of the refugee communities and usually doctors, nurses or midwives. No one has ever been prosecuted in Britain and campaigners and health workers usually only hear of rumours of their actions. Recently a Somali girl in Southall, west London, tipped off social services about nurses coming to circumcise her younger sister. But when the news leaked out the nurses disappeared. </p> <p>Circumcision, which varies in severity from cutting the clitoris to removing the labia and sewing up the vagina with thorns, occurs across the Horn of Africa. Last year alone, the number of asylum applications from Somalia, where virtually all young girls are severely mutilated during circumcisions, topped 7,400, compared with 1,780 in 1996. </p> <p>However, fighting circumcision is difficult. The tradition is entrenched and mothers face enormous pressure from family and friends to have daughters circumcised. If they do not they face being ostracised or divorced. </p> <p>The depth of belief in the practice is revealed in answers to an anonymous survey being conducted among Horn of Africa refugees living in London. The main protagonists behind the circumcisions are frequently elderly women, usually grandmothers.</p>",
  "<p>Hussein Chalayan spends more time than is healthy flying between London and New York. The British Designer of the Year has even used airline seats as the inspiration for a collec tion, making dresses with built-in headrests. Another ingeniously used flaps and battery-powered moving panels, like the wings of a plane. Twice a year, the frequent flyer shows two different collections on the catwalk - his own in London and, across the Atlantic, the luxury cashmere brand TSE New York. If cloning was an option, Chalayan would be first in the queue, not just because he could do with another pair of hands, but because he'd like to know what it was like to be cloned. </p> <p>When he is not in New York or in London, chances are Chalayan is in Istanbul. He travels there five or six times a year, visiting his show sponsor, Turkish textile group IKTIB, which is eager to promote designers of Turkish origin. They could not wish for a better role model than Chalayan for the fledgling talent they are trying to encourage at home. Just seven years since he left college, Chalayan has achieved worldwide acclaim. </p> <p>In July, Time magazine listed him as one of their 100 most influential innovators for the 21st century. He was the only fashion designer, alongside architects, industrial designers and dotcom geniuses. This says a lot about either the snobbery of Time towards fashion as a form of design and innovation, or the elevated status Chalayan has achieved for himself internationally. He is f ted by both the serious architecture and design set, who identify with his conceptual and philosophical approach to fashion (when Zaha Hadid was looking for a designer to create the uniforms for the Millennium Dome, Chalayan was her first stop), and fashion groupies, who simply love his clothes. He has also been nominated as best avant-garde designer by this year's prestigious New York VH1 Awards. In July, American Vogue included him as one of the 12 designers who will change the course of fashion over the next decade. It described him as 'the premier intellectual designer of his generation'. </p> <p>The fuss is well justified. At his best, Hussein Chalayan has the ability to create magic. And he never gives anything but his best. He is a perfectionist to the point of near-madness. His shows are not just feats of creativity, cutting and tailoring, but also of precision-timed choreography, too. Not for him the catwalk with bored-looking models marching into the pop of camera flashbulbs. He has shown in an art gallery in east London, a warehouse in King's Cross, on a go-kart track in south London and the on stage at Sadler's Wells Theatre in Islington. He designs all his own sets, and has elevated the fashion show into performance art. </p> <p>For this autumn, Chalayan created a minimal white room, with table and chairs. As the show progressed, the models stripped the room bare, incorporating the contents - including the furniture - into their clothes. The idea came from seeing news reports about refugees fleeing from Kosovo. 'I come from a part of the world that's turbulent,' he says. 'The collection was about leaving your house in times of war and hiding your possessions. Kosovo was a reminder of what happened in Cyprus.' The audience held its breath as a round table was transformed into a telescopic wooden skirt, and chair covers metamorphosed into dresses. It sounds pretentious - anything to do with the designer's work usually does. But, in reality, the shows are breathtaking; well-executed and brilliantly conceived, as are the clothes themselves. No wonder the fashion world is jamming his phone lines demanding more seats for his show on Wednesday. A change of venue has meant he had to reduce the number of invitations to an intimate 500. </p> <p>Since his graduation show from Central Saint Martins in 1993, when he sculpted a corset out of wood and buried clothes in a garden with iron filings to see how they would rust and decompose, Chalayan has been one of fashion's most challenging designers. His first student collection was promoted in the windows of Browns on South Molton Street, the showcase which launched the career of John Galliano. At the time, Caroline Collis of Browns said: 'He has a real spirit to his work and we felt that, because it was a college show, he wasn't constrained. He wasn't at all concerned with commerciality. It will inevitably come, but what he's produced at this stage is very free, searching and exciting.' The collection was inspired by the 17th-century French philosopher Descartes, and the clothes told the story of a fictional female scientist. </p> <p>I remember interviewing him then. It was 1994. I was a junior fashion writer on The Independent. He was a shy, nervy young man, desperately aware how easily he and his work could be misunderstood. His friend, Bj\u00f6rk, had already adopted him as her favourite clothes designer, wearing his paper clothes on stage. Typically, however, he didn't really want to talk about it. Was he being perverse? Or was he simply trying to keep hold of his integrity? After the portrait session, he insisted on picture approval. It wasn't vanity. He was simply paranoid about the press and how he would be represented. He even turned up at the office and I had to take a selection of prints to show him in the shabby reception area. 'I don't want mass-market appeal,' he said. And he was doing his damnedest not to get it. </p> <p>While Alexander McQueen shocked with his bum cleavages, Chalayan took on the mantle of fashion's Thinker. He quietly experimented. One season, he made an entire collection using Tyvek, the unrippable paper usually reserved for envelopes. Another, he designed dresses with straps that were held in place by balloons filled with helium. He made up narratives in his head and clothed the characters in them. At times, despite the fact that he was living in respectable, right-on Crouch End in north London, he seemed to be on another planet. Ask him why he had designed a particular shape, or why he had made a dress fly like a kite, and he would embark on a long, philosophical discussion. While most fashion designers make your head spin with their flights of fancy, Chalayan would leave you reaching for your Encyclopaedia Britannica . </p> <p>He still does not aspire to reach the mass market, although he has learnt that in order to survive, he has to diversify. Business has been a struggle. The company does not yet own a computer. He has worked with Top Shop, creating a capsule collection of designs for the chain store's more fashion- forward teenagers. And. this autumn, his first pieces for the Marks &amp; Spencer Autograph range have arrived on the shop floor, although they will not be branded as his designs. He began designing a luxury cashmere collection for TSE New York, which added weight to Chalayan's profile in the States, but seemingly still acting as a subsidy for his own label. Slowly, he has been expanding into extra space in his Covent Garden headquarters. His own office is simple: white-washed with a basic office desk and chair. Nothing fancy. He is not interested in the trappings of the designer lifestyle. </p> <p>Chalayan has just turned 30. It's 18 years since he moved from his home in Nicosia in northern Cyprus to England, where he was enrolled at Highgate Boys' School in north London. For a shy young teenager, with an exotic-sounding name that no one could pronounce, it was just another battleground, at times lonely and brutal. 'We were told as kids in Cyprus that when you eat something, you always offer it to someone else first,' he says, and remembers thinking it was mean of the children at school that they never offered around their bags of crisps. </p> <p>It wasn't until he was 17 that Chalayan became aware of the fact that there was such a thing as a degree in fashion design. 'I was always interested in clothing the body, but didn't know there was a course you could do.' He had decided on a future as an architect. But when he read a magazine article about the Turkish designer Rifat Ozbek, he discovered the fashion degree at Saint Martins School of Art and Design. At that point, his future suddenly became a little clearer. </p> <p>If Chalayan's parents had not separated when he was a child, he may well have spent his student days in Istanbul University rather than in the ramshackle studios of Central Saint Martins on London's Charing Cross Road. As a child, he lived close to the frontline between north and south Cyprus. 'There was a real border culture. You are living in mystery and don't know what's on the other side.' And of course, that was precisely what the young Chalayan wanted to know. Perhaps that explains why he is so very inquisitive. His process of designing is the result of a constant quest to learn more, whether it's philosophy, religion or science and technology. He has a habit of deflecting questions back on his interviewers, and always asks more questions than he answers. 'I'm just a very curious person,' he says. 'I've always been inquisitive, wanting to learn about new things. The more you live, the more you realise you don't know.' </p> <p>One subject that interests Chalayan is Islam. For his spring/summer 1998 collection, he created one of his most provocative images. The show ended with a line-up of six models. The first wore a chador, which covered most of her body and allowed a gap just for her eyes. Each veil became shorter and shorter until, finally, the last one was nude apart from a mask covering her face. 'It was about defining your cultural territory,' he says. 'How a group of people define their territory with their clothes. The covering of the body was also representative of death, the veil bringing the body to a mummy-like state. It is a deathly state. You're pretending you don't exist. By becoming an anonymous person, you are creating your own territory. It was such a powerful show - so moving for me.' </p> <p>The designer is interested in breaking barriers. That is why he came up with the idea to photograph diverse families living in Istanbul and reproduce them in a limited- edition book to be given away at his show and sold in aid of Turkish charities. 'Istanbul breaks a lot of rules,' he says. 'It's not what you think it is. The diversity is rich and exciting. People think it's an Islamic state, but its incredibly secular. As I get older, I realise how many more undiscovered things there are in this part of the world.' </p> <p>Although he is Cypriot by birth, Chalayan is fascinated by Istanbul, its geographical position straddling Europe and Asia, and its cultural diversity. 'It is my favourite European city,' he says. Recently, he designed a dress for one of Turkey's most popular singers, Sezen Aksu. On Thursday morning, the Turkish newspapers will feature his London show. And after his show on Wednesday night, the TV crews will be lining up for their two minutes of air time with Chalayan backstage. Although he doesn't yet sell so much as a T-shirt in Istanbul, the city has adopted him as its own. He's happy to be their golden boy. </p> <p>Whenever he goes he makes sure he pays a visit to Mete and Nadire Goktug, an architect couple who have lovingly restored the ruin of an old British jail and turned the ground and first floors into a teashop. The top floor has a studio room with a wall of glass on one side. Occasionally, they entertain there, and sometimes spend the night, although they actually live somewhere else. </p> <p>Food is one of the designer's favourite subjects. His list of things to see and do in Istanbul does not start with the Blue Mosque or the Haghia Sophia, but a fish restaurant by the Bosphorus, or a traditional Turkish restaurant, whose specialities include a variety of weeds. 'The Galata tearoom has the most amazing atmosphere,' says Chalayan. 'And you have to try the man-ti! They are like Turkish dim-sum, little parcels of meat or potato. They serve it with yoghurt.' Sure enough, the steaming bowl of potato man-ti is delicious. Nadire will read your fortune after you've finished with your tiny cup of strong, black Turkish coffee. Chalayan admits to being very superstitious. 'I have a belief that if you don't do something in a certain way, things won't be right. I think I do things to prevent certain things happening, and believe some actions might bring bad luck.' </p> <p>It is unexpected to hear Chalayan talk of such things as superstition. Looking at his clothes, you would expect him to be completely rational and logical at all times. But he says it is all part of his cultural background. 'I'm more of an instinctive and emotionally oriented person,' he says. 'I was brought up to focus on my emotions and be in touch with them. That is how my background affects my work. I refer to Turkish costumes at times. But it's more to do with my childhood and how I was brought up.' </p> <p>He is, to put it mildly, a very complex character - totally dedicated to his work, and absolutely single-minded in its execution. His vision of the world, as expressed by the more extreme and conceptual pieces in his collections, is certainly a unique and uncompromising one. It is difficult to define the abstract workings of Chalayan's brain. But as long as those cogs keep turning, churning up visions of Islam, superstitions, philosphies, scientific formulae, memories of war and the breaking down of borders, Hussein Chalayan will continue to inspire and be inspired. And the fashion world is left hanging in the balance, waiting to see what magic he will weave next.</p>",
  "Arpad Toth lights yet another cigarette and slumps heavily into a padded swivel chair. On the other side of the sliding glass doors at the far end of the room, darkness is falling. Momentarily, he raises his head and gazes balefully out at his disappearing garden. It was all going to be so perfect. It was going to be Eden. Now his five-year-old son is buried out there. <p>'I used to carry around this cyanide and I'll tell you, there were times when I was seconds away from... it looked like sugar. Looked exactly like sugar. Here, do you want some? You can have as much as you like...'</p> <p>He's smiling with his mouth, but not with his eyes, and I'm struck by the contrast between the muffled detonation of a man's soul and the fireworks on the Paulsgrove Estate in Portsmouth this summer, where cars were burnt and houses sacked and children carried placards screeching 'KILL THE BASTARDS' and chanted, 'Sex case, sex case: hang 'em, hang 'em, hang 'em' in reference to the faceless paedophile who is presumed to have taken Sarah Payne from her family. These two scenes, seemingly a universe apart, are about the same thing. This has been the summer of the dead child.</p> <p>We're sitting in a park on the outskirts of Croydon on a sunny September morning. Thirty feet away, a dozen or so small children are being entertained by a clown. The air is light with laughter and mums smirk as they hover watchfully in the background.</p> <p>'She's one of the better entertainers,' says Dee Warner. 'The ones we've had recently have been pretty bad. Even the kids noticed.'</p> <p>A conversation with Warner can be unsettling. One of the children giggling at the clown is her five-year-old son, Harry, while four-month-old Ellie sleeps in her pram. Our attention moves seamlessly between them and the unspeakable horror that is an everyday part of their mother's life. She and her friend Lynn Costello run the organisation Mothers Against Murder and Aggression, and the stories she carries around with her are shocking.</p> <p>There's the pair of 15-year-old girls seized by a gang of boys, taken to a barn, raped and set alight, then trammelled and scattered by firefighters who had no idea they were there; the parents whose daughter was knifed by a jealous schoolmate, whose only son then committed suicide next to a note indicating that he wanted to be with his sister. The man whose 10-year-old son and wife were beaten to death with a sledgehammer the day after the boy's birthday. The children taken and murdered by paedophiles and 'care in the community' psychiatric patients.</p> <p>It's lurid, horrendous, frightening stuff, and the examples given here are far from the worst. Warner and Costello formed MAMAA after James Bulger was killed by two 10-year-olds in 1993. They didn't have specific aims then, they just wanted to channel the despair they felt at a child being obliterated by other children. Now they run a helpline for the parents of murder victims from Warner's scrupulously tidy ex-local authority house on the edge of a pleasant estate. They also campaign for victims' rights and harsher punishments for offenders and supported the Paulsgrove protesters. What I want to know is how she lives with all this horror. And why?</p> <p>'Yeah, my brother-in-law says I'm paranoid,' she begins. 'He says I act like someone hanging around on every street corner waiting to take your child away. But I mean, what was the chance of Sarah Payne having a row with her brother and walking off? Sophie Hook was in her own back garden. People say I shouldn't make Harry so aware, but I'm afraid he is. When we did all the campaigning around [convicted paedophile] Sidney Cooke coming out, if he saw a picture of Sidney Cooke, he'd say, \"That man's really horrible and if you see him you should shout and shout and don't go with him.\" My sister said, \"Oh, my God...\" But what if he does see him?</p> <p>'And the scary thing is that with the \"name and shame\" thing, I showed Harry the photographs and he said, \"They don't look horrible, Mummy.\" I said, \"Well, that's the trouble, Harry, they don't always look horrible.\" People tell us that not all paedophiles murder, but they murder childhoods.'</p> <p>This is certainly true, but as I walk to my car, two things are running through my head. The first is a conversation I'd had with a child psychologist, who told me that an excess of fear can destroy childhoods, too. The second concerns a set of statistics supplied by the Home Office, which show that the number of children under the age of 10 who are known to be killed by strangers is astonishingly small.</p> <p>In 1994, there were none, while 1995 and 1996 saw two each, and the figures have remained more or less constant since figures became available. Most children are murdered and/or abused by people they know, usually relatives. Anyone who seriously wants to protect children might like to consider abolishing the family. These facts have been widely reported: we're aware of them, but it doesn't appear to help. My suspicion is that this is because, on the whole, we don't want it to.</p> <p>The fact is that something like 12,000 children under the age of 19 die each year. And nightmarish though Sidney Cooke is, even he can't match that. In this context, monsters become a soothing chimera, because monsters can be avoided, if we're good: the random horror of the world cannot. The problem is that the stories which have transfixed us this summer have had the effect of making child death seem at once palpitatingly present, yet also distant, freakish, unreal, little more than another opportunity for collective catharsis. Will Barbie be evicted from Big Brother ? Will the abducted girl die? These national cliffhangers are received in the same way, through the same media, and our collective responses look remarkably similar.</p> <p>The horror is increased, while the suffering is distanced. As one expert at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital scowled when asked to consider the idea that death is at least being brought out into the open: 'Yes, but if faced with a reality that's in danger of becoming too personalised, people still run a mile. The reality is as difficult as it ever was.'</p> <p>What follows is something of that reality.</p> <p>I'd heard and read a lot about Arpad Toth and his remarkable battle with the General Medical Council (GMC) following the unnecessary death of his son, but the man stalking across the drive to meet me was not what I'd expected. He is stocky and initially wary, a little spiky and nervous, prone to launch into lectures -almost any subject will do - at moments of discomfort. He built this drive, and the country house it leads to, and the stables and professional recording studio which take up most of the ground floor. Like a lot of perfectionists, he dresses his vulnerability with rigour, layers and layers of rigour - but a boy-like intensity radiates from his bleached-blue eyes and there is an agile, oppositional caste to his mind that is seldom less than entertaining. I found myself liking him very much. What I'd been told was true. You don't forget having met Toth.</p> <p>Now 47, his earliest memory is of watching tanks roll through the streets of Budapest from the balcony of his mother's apartment block. They escaped to England, where his mother married a fellow refugee, an art dealer. Arpad trained as an electrical engineer and worked as a technician at Oxford University before coming here. Eric Clapton and Radiohead recorded in the studio he built, and everything was progressing according to plan until his girlfriend informed him that she was pregnant. He was furious until his son, Wilfred, arrived, then fell in love in the hopeless, bewildered way that reluctant fathers often do.</p> <p>His boy was healthy, but had a congenital illness, a condition Toth describes as the inverse of diabetes, which meant that his body was capable of manufacturing and storing glucose in the liver, but couldn't retrieve it. The brain runs on glucose, so care had to be taken to ensure that Wilfred was given small but frequent feeds of carbohydrate or sugar. There had to be enough for his needs, but not so much as to burden the liver with excess supplies. It was a delicate balance to strike.</p> <p>The difficulty came at night, when the only way to regulate Wilfred's glucose intake was through a naso-gastric tube attached to a peristaltic pump. The system worked, but the pump had a serious design flaw in that once it had been set and the start button pressed, the only clear way to establish that it was working was to watch it for a period of time. Toth claims to have been close to finding a more reliable way of administering the glucose his son needed, when, on the morning of 9 October 1993, everything went wrong.</p> <p>Grimly but evenly, Toth describes the crisis which engulfed his family. That night, Wilfred's mother, a senior nurse who was six months pregnant with a second child, laid him in his usual place, between the spaces she and her husband would occupy in bed. She armed the pump and pressed the start button, but that night it didn't come on. Arpad came to bed early for him, at 2.30am, and watched satellite news, as was his habit, until he fell asleep. She rose early and fixed herself some coffee and was sitting up watching TV and reading the papers when Wilfred went into a violent hypoglycaemic fit. She woke her partner. According to them, it was now about 7.15am. They called their doctor's surgery and gave the boy some powdered glucose, which appeared to have no effect. What he needed was intravenous glucose.</p> <p>In their version, the doctor took an age to reach this very serious situation, then refused to administer the intravenous solution, instead offering barbiturates to control the fitting. Toth blames himself for his 'moment of doubt', during which he briefly lacked the confidence to insist that he knew better than a doctor who was about to do the wrong thing. Eventually, the GP called the local hospital in order to have Wilfred admitted 'for observation', then left. By the time the family arrived, manic and terrified, the brain damage caused by Wilfred's starvation of glucose was irreparable, and he never recovered from his coma. Toth turned off the life-support machine a week later, and the boy died in his arms.</p> <p>He took his complaint against his GP to the GMC and it was thrown out at the first hurdle, though if they'd known who they were dealing with, they might have reconsidered their haste. In the meantime, in his grief he refused to relinquish Wilfred to anyone. He took him home, called his friends round and they dug a huge hole in the frozen, wintry garden and plastered the walls and carpeted the floor until it looked like a scaled-down version of his son's room, Thomas the Tank Engine bed and all. One night, his partner came home and found the distraught Toth out there with a shovel, trying to rejoin his boy. When a daughter was born eight weeks later, in the same room in the same hospital as Wilfred, and a few doors away from the place where he died, her father could barely bring himself to acknowledge her presence.</p> <p>He blamed the doctor, his partner, himself, the universe. If there was still any kind of plot, he lost it, just wanted to exchange his grief for nothingness. He speaks of those early years with a kind of eerie detachment.</p> <p>'I think the only thing that stopped me from ending it then was that I thought, \"Christ, if I do this, I'll be betraying my son's memory.\" I gave in. I couldn't stand up to the powers that be. Then you think, \"Well, even if I make this statement, who would care? If they didn't care when my boy died, why the hell would they care when I die?\" So at times like that, I just went, \"Fuck it, I'm going to make a difference.\" And having suffered the ultimate insult, there's not a hell of a lot they can do to me any more, but there's a hell of a lot I can do in return.'</p> <p>I'd asked Arpad Toth whether he'd had anyone to confide in about all this. He'd replied that, no, he didn't; he'd felt alone, isolated, cut adrift from the rest of humanity. This is something you'll hear other parents say and which I caught a glimpse of on the train down to the Demelza House Children's Hospice in Sittingbourne, Kent.</p> <p>I was reading a leaflet giving details of an intense-sounding weekend course aimed at helping children come to terms with the death of relatives. At the end of it were some comments from participants and their guardians. One ran: 'My child was surprised to find other children in the same situation. When he told his story, he was really amazed that the other children did not laugh.' I must have appeared troubled by this, because I looked up to find the girl sitting next to me shifting her gaze uncomfortably and the woman opposite doing likewise. They'd seen what I was reading. They thought I'd lost a child - at least that's what I thought they thought - and a voice deep inside me wanted to say, 'No. No, I haven't. I'm OK. I'm like you.'</p> <p>I'm OK? And then I knew: we're afraid of people in this situation. We don't know what to say and fear the bleak force of the emotions involved, as though, in allowing them to enter us, we might conjure them into reality. If we infantilised inhabitants of the 21st century only relate to things we can identify with, the converse is also true: if we don't want to be identified with something, we shun it.</p> <p>Demelza House is a joyous place, with verdant grounds and everything a child with a terminal illness needs in order to be the careless scamp they deserve to be at this stage of life. Yet if you ask the staff how their jobs are perceived outside of their immediate environment, you will hear the same thing again and again. 'People either seem to see us as angels or lunatics,' says administrator Liz Johnson. 'And the effect on strangers when you tell them what you do can be astonishing. Conversations just stop. It's as though you've just told them you have leprosy. We tend to stick quite close to each other around here.'</p> <p>Staff on the Child Death Helpline at Great Ormond Street will tell you that people they call simply don't hear the word 'death' in their title. They hear 'deaf' or 'deer' or 'deb', or simply nothing at all ('Child wha'?') - anything but the reality. The few who do hear tend to gasp and try to get off the phone. The line has been going for five years, is staffed mostly by volunteers who've lost children and if you really want to know what the reality of the experience is, this is the place to visit.</p> <p>Anna, a volunteer, lost a 14-year-old son to leukaemia.'Most of us go through life assuming this will happen to someone else, and not beginning to understand what it's like. People feel huge sympathy, but just don't know what to say. Unfortunately, I think that one of the things which has come from all the reporting of children dying is that people suddenly become authorities on it and will try to demonstrate this to you, that they understand what you're going through. But they don't, they can't. And then in a month or so, they'll say, \"I expect you're feeling better now.\" People can get carried away on the wave of the feeling, or what they think this feeling is, and all these publicised tragedies have encouraged people to think that this is their way of being a part of that, you know. And they have no idea. You find yourself thinking, \"Why are you doing this? Just go about your business, maybe say a little prayer and be thankful it's not you...\"'</p> <p>So what does she say?</p> <p>'When you get a first-time caller and you're suddenly faced with this thing that has happened, my stomach immediately goes and the only thing I can say is, \"I'm just so sorry.\" Because I am. Just so sorry. People, I think, do find it hard to say that. It sounds trite, but sometimes it's all you can say.'</p> <p>Anna and her colleagues all talk of the isolation, the guilt, the blame, the anger, the fear for their other children and the loss of trust in the world, the complete loss of confidence, broken relationships, sense of helplessness and failure; the way you try to protect other members of your family and compensate for friends' discomfort, and the pressure this puts on you. The anniversaries, the pain when other children or grandchildren reach and pass the age at which yours died. The fact that your child, to one degree or another, had to make their final journey on their own. If the death was violent, there may be elements of post-traumatic stress - flashbacks, nightmares, imaginings of the fear the child might have felt. You never 'get over it', and there is no resolution. All you can do is learn to accommodate the loss, says coordinator Jean Simmons. The old five-stage models of grief, which purport to culminate in some sort of transcendence, she adds, are a waste of time.</p> <p>'We don't find those old linear models, in which you help people through certain stages until they can let go and resolve, helpful. We think it's more about holding on, finding ways to incorporate the loved person into your everyday existence, to recognise how they changed you and the influence they continue to have on your life and relationships.</p> <p>'Here, they won't be pathologised. The death of a child is special because, fortunately, not many will experience it. Nevertheless, there is a fear of bereaved people in society, which is strange, because it will happen to everybody at some stage, yet we treat it as if it were a pox. I think that's why they tend to be rushed off to counsellors. The pain is dealt with as an individual psychological response, but this is not something that's gone wrong with the bereaved individual - their response is normal and natural. The problem, often, is around them.'</p> <p>I wanted someone to tell me that the pain ends and things are all right in the end, but I'm not hearing that. No wonder we're scared of this stuff.</p> <p>Toth didn't believe in counselling either. Chain-smoking in his studio late into the night, he veers between sounding like Hamlet and General Patten as he describes his seven-year journey to here. Everything has changed. His relationship with his partner and daughter never recovered, for a start.</p> <p>'I suppose we never quite came back to each other,' he says quietly. 'Something's changed - I can't put my finger on it. And every time I look at my son's picture, I think, \"Christ, here we are seven years on, and I haven't achieved anything yet.\" I mean, I've achieved this, but it's still not enough.'</p> <p>By 'this', Toth means a famous victory he has just won over the GMC in the High Court, which could have far-reaching consequences for many, many people. According to his lawyer, Lee Ranford of Russell-Cooke Potter &amp; Chapman, 98 per cent of complaints brought to the GMC have hitherto failed, with an astonishing 90 per cent being rejected at the initial 'screening' stage. Now the organisation, whose motto is 'protecting patients, guiding doctors' ('We think it's been the reverse up to now,' says Ranford), has to have 'compelling reasons' for throwing out a complaint at this first stage, and must justify its decision, disclosing the evidence used to reach it. Toth has dozens of legal binders from the actions he has 'been forced' to bring against a range of parties.</p> <p>He appears to have been treated badly and can now re-animate his complaint against the GP involved in his son's case. He thinks that the same is true for many thousands of previous complainants and that, if even some of them make use of this new opportunity, the GMC would not be able to cope and would have to be replaced by an official body that could. Undeniably, this is an extraordinary thing that Toth has done, and there would appear to be plenty more to come.</p> <p>But what happens when the legal distractions are over and Arpad is just left with Arpad? I have to ask the question four times before he will give an answer that doesn't involve proceedings of some kind.</p> <p>'Well... it's something for me to do, isn't it. What I really like doing, what I've done all my life, is... I like inventing things. I like writing my music. I like doing my gardening. I don't really need to socialise. I'm quite happy with my own company and just dipping in and out of society as I need to. And I'd like a peaceful life. I don't want to be in strife all the time. But I find that nobody else is doing it. Nobody else is saying, \"I'm there for you.\"'</p> <p>Does the pain ever lessen?</p> <p>'No. Not really. You have flashbacks. You have dreams. You wish you could turn the clock back. If only I did something different. If only I didn't have that moment of doubt. It's a constant source of torment. You're faced with these people telling you they know and eventually you think, \"Maybe I am being hysterical, overreacting, losing my marbles,\" and eventually you cave in. And of course, death comes almost instantaneously and then you realise, \"Oh my God, I can't change my mind. In the space of one or two seconds, everything went, and there's no turning back.\" And even now I wake up in the middle of the night and say, \"Oh, he's here! Oh no, fucking hell, he ain't. It was a dream.\"</p> <p>'To lose a child is worse than losing a parent. It's unnatural, especially when it was avoidable. So you can't even inure yourself to the possibility, because the thought is too horrendous. So I think what'll probably happen is that this'll never finish. Even when the case against the doctor is concluded, I think that probably my path is set. I will always be there for the underdog. To try and change the system. Maybe one day I might even do something that will make it a bit more fair.'</p> <p>Arpad is slowing. I'm watching him dissolve like a snowman in the rain. 'You know, occasionally, when one of the animals died - a cat or a sheep - he made me promise that I would never die. Silly little thing. Then it turns out...'</p> <p>I'm wondering what to take from all this as I leave the Child Death Helpline offices and cross the road for a tour of Great Ormond Street Hospital. Like Demelza House, it is a buoyant, optimistic place, where thousands of children are being helped, cured, made more comfortable. Even here, though, the range of emotion you encounter makes your head swim. The horror is never far away. Outside, I'd passed a man and woman standing, he with his arms around her, each staring into some cruel and private distance, simply looking stranded.</p> <p>In the chapel, a big book where people can set down thoughts or prayers contained many entries along the lines of 'Please help me through my op. Charlotte, age 7' and 'Please help my friend Lynn.' One mother wrote a daily account of how her daughter's operations were going and you could feel her mood swing from hope to desperation to relief to anxiety, her girl's pain playing her like a game of poker. The entry that followed me home, though, simply read: 'Lord hear our cries and have mercy on my son. Please keep him safe in your arms forever.'</p> <p>Then, in the cancer ward, the revelation, as I watched a little girl of six or seven struggle through a door with a mobile drip which was so much bigger than she, then wrestle it grimly down the corridor. She'd lost her hair, presumably as a consequence of chemotherapy, and her face was misshapen, distended, with harrowed eyes wide with determination. You looked at her and your only possible thought was, 'This is not right. It shouldn't be happening,' at which point you either burst into tears or pull your jacket over your head, crouch to the floor and hop around like Basil Fawlty impersonating a frog. Neither, it is fair to assume, would be of much help.</p> <p>The thing is, we expect to be able to protect our children. We lead them to believe that we will, and in the main we do, but their childhood ends the day we no longer can, or will, and so does any echo of our own. In the adult world, joy tends to be anticipated, where horror drops out of the sky. We want the opposite for kids, for horror to be seen in advance and susceptible to control, while joy just happens. And we can't have that.</p> <p>Jean Simmons had told me that one of the most agonising decisions parents face when a child dies is what to dress them in for the funeral. 'They nearly always talk about dressing the child warmly,' she said. 'They're afraid they'll be cold.'

  "<p><strong> Isobel Parker <br> Age:</strong> 40<br> <strong> Lives in:</strong> Chichester, West Sussex<br> <strong> Occupation:</strong> Community health development officer<br> <strong> Earns:</strong> \u00a327,000<br> <strong> Mortgage:</strong> \u00a363,000<br> <strong> Debts:</strong> Credit card and other debts totalling about \u00a38,000<br> <strong> Investments:</strong> \u00a3200 in a Tessa<br> <strong> Pension:</strong> Member of occupational scheme<br> <strong> Aim:</strong> To clear her debts in the best way and start saving</p> <p>Earlier this year, Isobel Parker returned from Romania, where she had spent 12 months working with Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO), helping develop community health services for women and children. Although she had experience in a similar field here, working with rural communities who had, among other things, no access to running water, provided a very different set of challenges. </p> <p>Now back home, she faces the next challenge: sorting out her finances. </p> <p>'When you work for VSO you are paid at the local rate, which in my case was \u00a3120 a month. Although I had let my house in Chichester while I was away to help cover expenses in the UK such as my mortgage, the rent did not cover everything. So I ran up a fair amount of debt. I would now like to find out the best way to clear it.' </p> <p>The bulk of her debts - \u00a36,000 - went on two credit cards, with First Direct and RBS Advanta. Currently she is making only the minimum monthly repayments on these. In addition, she has an agreed \u00a31,200 bank overdraft and an informal loan of \u00a31,000 from friends. </p> <p>She is wondering whether to consolidate her debts by taking out a personal loan, or to add them to her mortgage - \u00a363,000 with Halifax. It is a fixed-rate loan with a redemption penalty period expiring in 2003. She is repaying it through a mixture of an endowment (\u00a344,000), an Isa (\u00a315,000) and an ordinary repayment loan (\u00a34,000). </p> <p>She says she has enough spare equity in the property to increase her mortgage if necessary and estimates it is now worth around \u00a395,000. </p> <p>She took a sabbatical from her job with a Health Authority when she decided to go to Romania, but has now decided to move on to a new position with a local authority, for which she needs a car. Fortunately her new employer is providing her with a loan for this purpose. She has also become a member of the local government pension scheme, to which she is transferring the benefits she had built up with the NHS scheme. </p> <p>Her pension scheme pro vides her with some life assurance and she also has \u00a313,000 of critical illness cover. She has two bank accounts, with the Halifax and with First Direct. </p> <p>Her only savings are just less than \u00a3200 in a Tessa, which she opened with First Direct just before the tax-free accounts were abolished in April 1999. Once she has sorted her debts out, she would like to save more for the future.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Sharon Linnard</strong></p> <p>VSO work can be very rewarding but not financially, as Isobel has discovered. She is right in making debt repayment her first priority because, although minimum payments on credit cards seem acceptable, the underlying interest rate is surprisingly high. First Direct's rate is 18.9 per cent a year, with RBS Advanta not far behind at 17.9 per cent. </p> <p>One way of containing this is to make an application to a different provider where for a limited period a much lower rate is charged on debts transferred. A good example is the Nationwide Building Society whose Visa Card.</p> <p>However, this only buys time. Isobel should try to reduce the amount outstanding as much as she can in that period. Were there more in her Tessa, it would be tempting to use that to reduce borrowing, but she may prefer to keep the account open so that once her debts are repaid, she can resurrect a very tax-efficient account.</p> <p>She could talk to the Halifax about suspending payments under the Isa for a period and converting the whole of her loan to interest-only for the time being, though the endowment should be maintained. This would allow her to reduce her credit card borrowings.</p> <p>On the positive side, Isobel is a member of an excellent occupational pension scheme which, to some extent, reduces the urgency over increasing her savings. </p> <p>\u0095 Sharon Linnard works for chartered accountant Blick Rothenberg.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Gordon Wilson </strong></p> <p>The key to clearing debt is to focus on the rate of interest being paid and find the cheapest rate possible. Overdrafts are generally expensive. In addition to high interest rates, there are often transaction charges. I would also steer clear of personal loans. Rates tend to be high and they are inflexible, although this can suit people who need the discipline of fixed repayments. </p> <p>Isobel does not really have the option of increasing her mortgage, due to the redemption penalties. She could review the position in 2003. Depending on how much debt she has cleared, increasing the mortgage could be useful.</p> <p>I would suggest that Isobel considers consolidating her debt to a low cost credit card. Very low introductory rates are currently available. Isobel could then establish how much she can afford to repay each month and set up a direct debit to the card company.</p> <p>This means Isobel is in control and the debt can be cleared more quickly if funds become available. One catch is that many credit card companies offer the introductory rate for only six months; after that it could increase substantially. Isobel would need to transfer her balance before the rate increased.</p> <p>Once the debt is clear, Isobel's thoughts should turn to her retirement. She could consider Additional Voluntary Contributions, Stakeholder Pensions and Isas. </p> <p>\u0095 Gordon Wilson works for financial adviser Aitchison &amp; Colegrave. </p> <p>Advice is for guidance only.</p> <p>\u0095 Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

  "<p>There is just a certain something about guitars. More than almost any musical instruments, with the possible exception of saxophones, they are the epitome of cool. At school guys who played the violin or flute were seen as swotty and dull, but if they could bash out a couple of chords on a beaten-up old Fender, that was a different matter. </p> <p>Guitars are also aesthetic objects: their basic curves may be found in violins and cellos, but only 'axes' can pull off cherry sunburst, cardinal red, or even silver sparkle finishes with aplomb, and as a result they've become increasingly desirable. This means that many are great investments, appreciating by 10 to 20 per cent a year - far better returns than you'll find in a building society or Isa. </p> <p>The good news is that you don't have to earn a rock star's wages to afford such an asset. Noel Gallagher of Oasis used his Switch card to buy a guitar for less than \u00a3500 just before he hit the big time and has now, apparently, developed quite an eye for collectables. However, you need to know what to look for because, as in any market, there are duds and fakes. </p> <p>Rick Zsigmond is a partner in London's Vintage Guitar Emporium and has sold instruments to some of the biggest names in the business. His shop's toilet walls are covered in autographs and read like a 'Who's Who' of rock and pop - Holly Johnson, Jon Bon Jovi, Gary Moore, Bryan Adams and Rory Gallagher. Loyd Grossman's name also appears among them; it seems the Masterchef presenter is an avid collector (yes, really). </p> <p>'The first rule about buying a guitar is that you have to love it,' says Zsigmond. 'Go for a sound you like and admire. For instance, if you're a fan of Buddy Holly, or indeed Jimi Hendrix, you might choose a Fender Stratocaster.' Both of these rock legends had their Strats engraved on their headstones. </p> <p>Paul Alcantara, a London-based writer and guitar teacher with around 30 instruments in his collection, echoes this sentiment: 'When you buy a vintage guitar, a little magic comes with it. It should be something that interests you and you shouldn't be afraid to play it. For those of us who grew up in the postwar years, electric guitars have become potent icons of the rock 'n' roll era. That's why products of the mid-Fifties to mid-Sixties are the most sought after.' </p> <p>At the top of the price scale are US manufacturers such as Fender, Gibson, Epiphone, Martin and Rickenbacker. One of these makes from the peak era would be a serious investment, setting you back thousands of pounds. The price rises further with the 'Cor' factor: clean, original and rare. A 1958 Gibson Flying V in natural korina finish was recently on sale for \u00a355,000, and prices can reach \u00a380,000 for a really desirable instrument. </p> <p>But if your means are modest there is still a variety of good guitars around. Alcantara is a fan of the US brand Paul Reed Smith, among others. He bought a 1987 model for \u00a3900 last year. The same model in similar condition would now cost around \u00a31,500. He says: 'It is just a lovely quality guitar, with Brazilian rosewood fretboard, a material not used any more [for ecological reasons].' Other makes he rates are Musicman and Tom Anderson, in electric, and Santa Cruz, Collings and Taylor acoustic guitars. </p> <p>He believes that, unless you're an expert, it is often safer to buy an instrument for \u00a3700 rather than \u00a37,000. 'Who's going to bother to fake it for a few hundred? Higher up the scale, there's a bigger incentive.' </p> <p>His success has come from trying to stay one step ahead, buying instruments that appeal to him as a player and often choosing 'sleepers', makes which have yet to reach their potential on the market. </p> <p>'Guitars produced in the Eighties, such as Jackson, often came with lurid graphic finishes and can be found for a fraction of their original retail price. Who knows? A heavy metal revival and these could become highly desirable.' </p> <p>He has already scored from this approach. 'I bought some Danelectros, made of masonite [hardboard to us] with lipstick tubes for pick-ups, which stopped being produced in 1968. Some cost as little as \u00a3150. I've sold some now and done quite well, but I've also held on to a few.' </p> <p>Zsigmond believes that, if you are just starting out, re-issues of classics such as Fenders and Gibson Les Pauls can be a good buy. He says: 'They may depreciate briefly, but then you can watch the value start to climb back up.' </p> <p>Alcantara, though, strikes a note of caution: 'Some of the limited edition reissues are made in greater quantity than a maker such as Rickenbacker would produce its originals.' </p> <p>Both agree that the best advice is to follow your nose. 'Some people just have a feel for the right guitar,' says Zsigmond. </p> <p>Once you have an idea of what you want, what should you look out for? 'Restoration,' says Zsigmond, 'can render a guitar virtually worthless. If you suspect an instrument has had major repairs or a change to the finish, walk away.' </p> <p>Small repairs or knocks, though, are generally not too serious: they won't affect the value too much and they can give the guitar character. Other repairs, such as changing the frets, are essential - but in some of the older, rarer guitars, this can affect the value. </p> <p>'Then you find owners who are afraid to play their instru ments, which seems a shame,' says Alcantara. </p> <p>The finish can also make a big difference to the price. A good condition 1966 Gibson Firebird in a wood finish, for instance, is now worth around \u00a33,000, says Zsigmond, but in cardinal red it's worth \u00a37,000. </p> <p>Other popular or 'custom' finishes go under such evocative names as candy apple red, seafoam green, shoreline gold, blue sparkle and aqua pearl. However, take care in this area: the premium price asked for a rare colour means they are susceptible to faking. </p> <p>If the collecting bug takes hold, there are several ways of adding to or upgrading your collection without breaking the bank. You could pool resources with like-minded friends, for instance. Zsigmond sells to a group of five City workers, whose primary motive is investment, but who take it in turns to take their jointly owned guitars home to play. </p> <p>As values rise, they upgrade their instruments, often by part-exchanging. This is a route taken by single collectors as well, starting small and building up gradually. </p> <p>Another option is swapping with other enthusiasts. 'People develop different tastes,' says Alcantara. 'Collectors meet and swap regularly.' </p> <p>The most important thing, however, is to enjoy what you collect. You don't have to be Eric Clapton to appreciate the quality of what you've bought, even if all you do is 'noodle' away in your sitting room. </p> <p>As Alcantara says: 'You can play an old guitar, but you can't post an old stamp, can you?'</p> <p><strong>How to ensure your 'axe' keeps its cutting edge </strong></p> <p>Avoid storage where temperatures fluctuate, such as near radiators or heating pipes. For acoustics, it might be worth buying a humidifier. </p> <p>If you move your guitar through different temperatures, leave it in its case for a couple of hours to acclimatise or the finish could crack.</p> <p>When cleaning your guitar, do not use polishes that are:</p> <p>\u0095 paraffin-based; they will dull the finish.</p> <p>\u0095 waxy; they may leave the instrument greasy for weeks.</p> <p>\u0095 made with silicone.</p> <p>Wipe your guitar with a damp cloth and replace the strings regularly.</p>"
