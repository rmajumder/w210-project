  "<p>This may be an apocryphal story, but it goes as follows: After Andreas Niniadis scored for Olympiakos Piraeus last weekend, he picked up a mobile phone hurled at him by a helpful opposing fan and dialled the number of Diego Maradona in Cuba. </p> <p>'Hello,' said Maradona. </p> <p>'Diego, is that you?' asked Niniadis. </p> <p>'Who is this?' asked Maradona. </p> <p>'Come on, Diego, it's me,' said Niniadis. 'Andreas from Greece. Niniadis from Olympiakos. Don't you remember me?' After more embarrassing explanations along these lines, Niniadis wished Maradona a happy fortieth birthday. Maradona, who may have forgotten that it was his birthday, said, 'You made a mistake,' and hung up. </p> <p>This call probably never happened, because it is difficult to imagine a Greek footballer speaking a word of a foreign language. Even so, the conversation sums up the tragicomedy that is Greek football, because the man Maradona had never heard of is a hero in Greece. </p> <p>The Greek game hopes to improve its image somewhat this Wednesday, when Panathinaikos receive Juventus in the Champions League. The Greeks will be through to the second round if they win, so the match is being hailed as the biggest encounter in the region since the Trojan War, or perhaps bigger. Olympiakos Piraeus will join Panathinaikos in the last 16 if they draw at Olympique Lyon on Tuesday. </p> <p>This would delight Greek football fans, who are refreshingly unspoiled. No Greek side have ever won a European trophy, and when the national team finally qualified for a World Cup in 1994 they ended up wishing they hadn't bothered. I remember watching their practices near Boston: an outfield player would stand in goal while others blasted shots over the bar. In matches they were thrashed. Athenian bars were packed with people making obscene gestures at television sets. </p> <p>It is remarkable that a reasonably prosperous European country of more than 10 million people has achieved so little in football that basketball is in danger of becoming the national sport. The best a Greek team ever managed was Panathinaikos's appearance in the European Cup final at Wembley in 1971, when they lost 2-0 to Ajax. However, in his book Champions of Europe Brian Glanville says the club 'were outrageously favoured by the French referee of their return home leg against Everton in the quarter-finals'. Joe Royle, then an Everton player, recalled how in the first match at Goodison Greek defenders would whisper in his ear, 'Athens, Athens!' </p> <p>'And in Athens', records Glanville, 'Everton got nothing from the referee.' </p> <p>Generally, there are so many bribery scandals in Greek football that they hardly qualify as scandals. The big clubs are traditionally owned by very rich men who use football as a way to snuggle up to government. The Olympiakos president and telecoms magnate Socrates Kokalis is a friend of the governing Pasok party, while the upper echelons of Panathinaikos, once pally with the ruling military junta, are now closer to the New Democracy party. Government contracts are worth a lot in Greece. </p> <p>One foreign manager recalls frequent summonses to meet his president behind suburban Athenian train stations late at night, where he would be told which players to put in his team. Presidents also delight in suddenly buying players, and if the coach doesn't like them, well, he's never around for long anyway. </p> <p>You might think all this would prompt the best Greek players to move abroad. It seldom does, and even when they do leave they usually come home fast. Grigoris Georgatos, the Olympiakos defender, joined Inter Milan a year ago, played rather well, but returned to Greece after one season desperately homesick despite having spent most of his free time in Athens. A rare Greek to have prospered abroad, the Ajax striker Nikos Machlas, admitted to having spent his first months in Holland crossing the days off a calendar. Greek footballers make English footballers look cosmopolitan. </p> <p>In any case, why leave Greece? It is a delightful country with excellent pay for footballers. This summer Panathinaikos reportedly offered Teddy Sheringham a salary of \u00a31 million net. Well-known players who fail in Spain or Italy often end up in Greece, their arrival generally prompting the newspaper headline, 'I Have Not Come for the Money'. Olympiakos currently boast the Brazilian Giovanni, while Panathinaikos have the Croat Goran Vlaovic and the Portuguese Paolo Sousa, none of whom has so far performed miracles. </p> <p>It would be wrong to say that Greek fans expect too much. In fact, they expect very little. When the national team played a friendly against Austria in February, only 600 people turned up. Even Greek fans, however, had expected better than a defeat in the recent World Cup qualifier in Albania, much as it pleased hundreds of thousands of dirt-poor Albanian migrant labourers. Surely England should be able to nose ahead of Greece and finish second in the qualifying group? </p>",
  "<p>'Ice is nice when you ski in the right position,' said Meinhardt, our ski instructor in St Anton, cradle of Austrian skiing. 'When it is a little bit icy, we heff ze edges,' he emphasised with a large grin. 'And more edges equals more holiday.' </p> <p>Not having had a ski lesson in the Alps for over a decade, I was curious to see whether Alpine instruction had moved on from 'Bend ze knees and follow me'. </p> <p> <strong> Austria</strong> </p> <p> An instructor took me on to the snow, pointed up the hill and said: 'Go.' I trudged 100 metres up, put on my skis and made as many turns as I could in the short descent. 'Ok, join the ski safari (a ski tour of the Arlberg region) with Meinhardt. We can assess skiers just by how they handle the skis. Seeing them skiing confirms this.' </p> <p>Founded in the Arlberg by Hannes Schneider in the Twenties, the Austrian skiing technique is characterised by the wedel , a succession of fast turns on the fall-line. Today there are some 500 ski schools and over 12,000 instructors, all trained by the Austrian Ski Federation. Jurgen took up the story: 'Boot technology has transformed skiing. More recently the shaped, waisted (or 'carving') ski has made it easier to turn and edge the skis with less effort. Up to a certain level our teaching is the same as before; how to balance, feeling the support of boot and ski. Sliding is still the same. From about level four (advanced intermediates) we teach skiers to use the shape of the ski, to carve.' Across the Alps, adult beginners are recommended 'fun' carving skis - about nose height. </p> <p>'The main problem for skiers,' continued Jurgen, 'is how to shift the upper body and weight. Teaching is about how to break up a movement into parts. We have to let the client know what is wrong and how to make it right.' </p> <p>The Austrians, French and Swiss all divide skiers into six groups, from novice to expert. Instructors who speak good English are widely available. </p> <p>This was Meinhardt's tenth season teaching in St Anton. He graduated from the Austrian National Ski School over a five years, working first with beginners, then as a county instructor and finally as a national instructor. </p> <p>'Steve, more leg action up and down. We heff steel edges so the ice dumplings are no problem, unless we lean back into the slope.' Guilty as charged. 'If you use the expensive waisting of your skis properly, then you have more holiday. But if you let them slide, you might as well be on old-fashioned straight skis.' </p> <p>'Round turns are the best, Denise. Go slowly down for the whole steering phase. If you go down too quickly, you have no pressure left to apply and you lose the edge. This means less holiday.' </p> <p>Throughout the day Meinhardt emptied our minds of bad habits by a variety of tricks; skiing without sticks, touching our knees as we turned, synchronising turns with the skier in front, linking slalom poles with the next skier. He even produced a rope, which we had to wind around our midriff contrary to the direction of the turn. It worked. We found we leant down the hill more, naturally assuming a better position, skiing faster but still in control. Meinhardt summed it up over a beer. 'Skiing is kneeing. More leg action, more flex, don't waste the waist of your ski. Look down the hill.' </p> <p> <strong> France</strong> </p> <p> 'What is your exact skiing standard?' asked Lionel outside the Ecole du Ski Fran\u00e7ais (ESF) in Chamonix. After some cross-examination about how I handle black runs and moguls, a class was fixed. </p> <p>Of the 13,500 instructors in 250 French resorts, 80 per cent are male. The average age is 34. Lionel Didier, 33, who passed his ESF national diploma in 1989, has been a full-time instructor for six years. He usually works with English-speakers. 'When the English say they want to learn, they mean it,' he said.'They tell the truth about their skiing standard, so it is easy to put them in a class. Grouping is very important; a well-chosen group has a synergy that helps everyone improve. But a slow person feels pressure and the group gets bored.' </p> <p>Lionel puts great emphasis on the psychological aspect of the sport. 'You have to be attentive to people and their wishes. I would say your skiing reflects how you really are as a person.' So poetic, so very French. And so worrying - I was about to be rumbled. </p> <p>Lionel likes to teach by example and imitation. Technical explanations are saved for when people are resting. 'Copying is quicker than understanding. Look at me, see the picture and copy. I know what you are thinking, \"Ooof, it is steep, I am going to fall\".' </p> <p>Now for the first trick. 'What do we put on frightened horses? Blinkers. Hold your poles shoulder-width like a window frame. Look at the downhill view. Turn the window like a robot. Don't use the upper body to turn. Turn with a down-and-up motion. Was it a nightmare? Good. This means that with the window you can't use the type of turn you normally use; you have to use your weight.' </p> <p>The encouragement continues: 'If you are scared, don't look at the slope, don't think of what might happen: use your window. There is no one skiing technique. There are many - for ice, powder, crust, spring snow. With the knees you can be precise. In deep snow, not much edge. For ice, lots of edge. </p> <p>'Allez, Barbara.' Just up from a less advanced class, Barbara is apprehensive on the black runs, finding this group younger and fitter. Lionel is attentive. 'Trust me, ski behind me.' At the front of the class she will not notice the speed. Her confidence increases. We try another trick - lifting the uphill knee while keeping the ski tip on the snow; this keeps the weight forward. 'Don't set your mental computer into turning mode, but into feeling what the ski is doing. Once you feel it, you have it forever.' </p> <p> <strong> Switzerland</strong> </p> <p> 'Gravity is a game,' began Gaby Fischer, our instructor in Nendaz, near Verbier. 'Carving skis have transformed Swiss teaching. Instruction used to be more academic.Now we no longer seek perfection, we just have fun.' The Swiss Ski School, established in 1930, formerly taught to a rigid format. But the Swiss have revamped their methods as a direct result of the now-standard carving skis. Qualifying as a Swiss ski instructor is harder than ever, with 65 per cent failing the skiing tests in the first assessments. It takes nearly six weeks over two years to qualify as a Professor de Ski, with annual refreshers. </p> <p>'Now that the pistes are always prepared and bumps are harder to find, skiers can enjoy a wider, stabler and more individual stance,' said Gaby, now in his seventh season teaching in Nendaz. With typical Swiss precision the all-important 'resistance to the snow' has been broken down into a number of key elements which apply equally to snowboarding: edge, slide, find resistance, make the turn; weight and unweight, set the edge. </p> <p>In my intermediate class, Gaby taught initiation of the turn from the centre of gravity, the belly-button; move this in the desired direction of travel and everything else follows. Gaby's teaching was supplemented by a variety of trick turns. We tried the crab, the Swedish, the Norwegian, even some faltering freestyle. He tailored his advice to our personalities.'Some people are tactile, some artistic, some musical. We try all sorts of things. Rachel, try thinking of long turns as a melody, like a waltz. Mike, on short turns, you need aggression, more techno, more samba.' </p> <p> I left the Alps feeling that instruction is better than it has ever been. With the latest equipment, skiing has become easier and more fun. Great care is taken to place the skier in the right group. Good teaching today depends not so much on traditional national methods, which are moving ever closer together, but on the instructor's personality. </p> <p>My instructors were attentive, innovative and perceptive. Lionel showed me a window in the mist. Gaby got me waltzing in difficult snow. And Meinhardt got me using my knees and edges so I had 'more holiday'. </p> <p>But in the end, you still have to 'bend ze knees'. It is just that now, they have so many different ways of telling you how to do it.</p> <p><strong>Downhill all the way</strong></p> <p>Stephen Lee drove to the Alps, travelling from Portsmouth to Le Havre with <a href=\"http://www.poportsmouth.com\">P&amp;O Portsmouth</a>: 0870 2424 999.</p> <p><strong>Switzerland</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.switzerlandtourism.ch\">www.switzerlandtourism.ch</a><br> Nendaz - <a href=\"http://www.skinendaz.ch\">www.skinendaz.ch</a> Hotel Deserteur: good position and old Swiss charm (00 41 27 288 2455)</p> <p><strong>Austria</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.austria-tourism.at\">www.austria-tourism.at</a><br> St Anton - <a href=\"http://www.stantonam arlberg.com\">www.stantonam arlberg.com</a><br> Hotel Neue Post: superb position and elegance.

  "<p>In court 67 of the Royal Courts of Justice in London last week Oxford University and the style of the English establishment were subjected to unaccustomed scrutiny. The case against Oxford was plain to see. The university was accused of treating Nadeem Ahmed so perversely when it deemed he had failed an exam that an unprecedented intervention by the judiciary in its affairs was in order. Ahmed is, as you may have guessed, a British Asian and his second and equally unprecedented charge that Oxford is a racist institution will be heard by the County Court in a few weeks. </p> <p>The establishment style was harder to pin down. You caught it in the circumlocutions of the pack of university lawyers and a faint, musty smell in the air. Both suggested that Oxford remained a self-protecting world where students were expected to fall on their swords without a murmur; where nudges and hints were preferred to precise, open standards. Transparency would allow the public to look in and pass impertinent judgments. Better, far better, to keep the waters muddy and the procedures obscure. </p> <p>Amateurism has its champions. But the informal approach is an absolute disaster when accusations of racism are made. A simple question - did Nadeem Ahmed pass or fail? - which any other academic institution could resolve without breaking sweat, has become the subject of two court hearings. </p> <p>Ahmed is neat and rather donnish. He did not strike me a professional victim willing to cover his failings with bellows of 'racists'. Quite the reverse. In the months before his case came to court he had displayed a deplorable unwillingness to shoot his mouth off to Observer columnists desperate for a story, as I learned the hard way. </p> <p>He went to Oxford to study the tranquil Sufi philosophy of the Islamic kingdoms of medieval Spain. His experience was anything but calming. The supervisor of his post-graduate degree was Dr Fritz Zimmermann from the School of Oriental Studies. They did not get on. </p> <p>In 1999 Ahmed and his fellow students were told to sit an exam in Arabic. A white woman who had no training in Arabic before she had begun the course sailed through. Ahmed who studied Arabic at the University of London, and whose tutor there described him as a proficient pupil, failed. </p> <p>According to Ahmed's evidence, Zimmermann told him afterwards: 'Why are you so interested in academia, is it the glamour? You are not cut out for academia. You have a basic problem with languages. Seriously, are you dyslexic? You give the impression of being an uneducated person?' When Ahmed replied that he had tried to produce a stylish rather than a literal translation, he alleges Zimmermann countered: 'Well, that is just your problem. Where a text is clear-cut and simple, you wish to turn your behind around and fart on it with your obscurity.' These fighting words concluded with Zimmermann saying that Ahmed should leave Oxford. Yet, peculiarly, he could not order him to go because the 'exam' his student had sat, and on which his academic ambitions rested, was not an exam. </p> <p>I'll explain as best I can. Normal exams are set by a rigorous and independent exam board. The papers are not marked by a pupil's teachers - accusations of bias would fly if they were - but by external examiners. None of these conditions applied in the School of Oriental Studies. The exam was set by Zimmermann and marked by Zimmermann. It wasn't an exam but an informal test. Ahmed couldn't be expelled for failing it. </p> <p>Zimmermann and the university deny all accusations of racism vehemently and I've no way of knowing whether Ahmed is a victim or an academic incompetent. But Oxford accepts that the 'exam' was flawed because it was 'not independent' and 'not double-marked'. The university adds that a second 'exam' Ahmed took after he protested was also flawed. In this instance, Ahmed wasn't just presented with a translation but had to answer supplementary questions on Arabic grammar which his fellow students had been spared. </p> <p>The scholar found himself in a weird position. The School of Oriental Studies said it wanted to see the back of him, but couldn't force him to leave. Ahmed was called to meetings in pubs and asked to be a good chap and disappear. In these circumstances, most graduates go. There is no point in studying under dons who don't want to teach you. Ahmed, however, decided to stay and fight for the right to be taught. 'I know I will have a miserable time if I win,' he told me. 'But I want to make sure that no Asian or black student at Oxford goes through what I've gone through.' </p> <p>Ahmed searched for allies. The university had no ethnic minority officers for Asian students with a grievance, so he appealed to Tom Paulin, who teaches at his college. Readers who have seen Paulin explode on BBC2 when asked to comment on the latest saccharine film or Britart banality may think there is not a force on earth which can stand in his way when a rage is upon him (with the possible exception of a battle-ready nuclear sub). Paulin made more than 100 phone calls but got nowhere. No one wanted to listen. </p> <p>Paulin says he is 'deeply concerned' and I can understand why. If Ahmed wins in the High Court, a ruling is expected tomorrow, or succeeds in substantiating his racism charge, Oxford will look like an dysfunctional relic. Discrimination is at its worst in those industries - journalism is one - which don't advertise jobs but rely on informal recommendations and word of mouth. Pupils may soon learn that Oxford apes the informality of the worst employers. </p> <p>A victory for Ahmed would also encourage Ministers to turn what is left of their socialist scorn on Oxford and Cambridge. Gordon Brown may have got his facts hopelessly wrong during the Laura Spence affair, but his broad argument was undeniable. The 7 per cent of pupils who go to private schools make up one third of all students who get three As at A-level but receive 50 per cent of Oxbridge places. </p> <p>There are, of course, many in both universities who are desperate to connect their colleges to the rest of society but they may be fighting a losing battle. Applications from state schools fell this year. Oxbridge academics complain that it is getting harder to persuade working- and middle-class students to apply to universities where they believe they will be belittled by plausible but dimwitted snobs. Ahmed says he is fighting for the black and Asian Oxford students of the future. They could be few in number. </p> <p><strong>Who is allowed to remember the Armenians? Not us</strong></p> <p>'Who now remembers the Armenians?' Hitler asked as he brushed aside objection to the extermination of European Jewry. About one and a half million Armenian Christians were slaughtered by the Turks in 1915. Few cared about them in 1941 let alone 2000. </p> <p>Certainly the Home Office and the BBC are insouciant. They have decided that the first Holocaust memorial day commemoration - which, I suspect, will be a triumph of professional mourning over history - should contain no mention of the genocide that suggested to Hitler he could get away with mass murder. </p> <p>There are good political reasons for amnesia. Turkey is an Armenian Holocaust denier. Last month Ankara told Washington it would not let the US Air Force use its bases if Clinton accepted that what happened was genocide. </p> <p>The same pressures may be at work in Britain. When Sarah Topalian, a British citizen with an Armenian father, complained to Neil Frater, the Home Office master of Holocaust ceremonies, she was told that the Foreign Office had intervened. 'Some people might conclude' that Turkish pressure had been effective, Frater said. </p> <p>It's an old story. The designers of the Washington Holocaust Museum promised Armenians that their past would be mentioned. They broke their word when the museum's council decided that discussion of Armenians diluted the 'unprecedented' character of Jewish suffering and the Israeli government said it was anxious not to offend its ally, Turkey. </p> <p>American Holocaust museums are not keen on finding space for the communists, the socialists, the trade unionists and the mentally ill - Hitler's first victims - either. No one goes on about Hitler's killing of 500,000 gypsies. They are even more unpopular than the Reds. </p> <p>Holocaust commemoration is too often the manipulation of the past for present purposes, and the Turks and museum directors aren't the only culprits. US and Israeli Jewish leaders have disgraced themselves by claiming that the suffering of European Jews was 'unique' and used it to brand protest against the persecution of the Palestinians with race laws and overwhelming force as 'anti-semitism'. If what happened to Jews is unique, replied the brilliant (and Jewish) historian Peter Novick what are these 'lessons' Holocaust Days are meant to teach us? Surely the unique can never be repeated and we can all therefore ignore it? </p> <p>To me, the only lesson to be learned is to support asylum-seekers as they are libelled and denied sanctuary by Jack Straw and Ann Widdecombe. We should ask the British politicians to reform themselves rather than wallow in a phoney concern for the Jews whose 'bogus' claims for asylum they would have rejected had they been in office in the Thirties.</p>",
  "<p>Film stars, when you meet them, can seem disarmingly small. If you saw the grungily anonymous Joaquin Phoenix on the street, you wouldn't notice him or you might look the other way with a grimace. But once his face is magnified and projected on to a screen, its play of alert, wounded expression becomes mesmeric and his identity multiplies as we watch. </p> <p>Earlier this year, he was the slimily incestuous emperor in Gladiator. Now, he has two new films out, and two new personae on show. In James Gray's The Yards, he plays Willie Gutierrez, a Puerto Rican wideboy for whom racketeering on the New York subway offers a frail chance of social mobility. This will be followed by Philip Kaufman's Quills. Here, Phoenix is the tenderly idealistic Abb\u00e9 de Coulmier, the cleric in charge of the asylum where the Marquis de Sade was confined, who finds himself tempted and corrupted by his prisoner's doctrine of sensual liberty. </p> <p>On the way to the Dorchester for my interview with Phoenix, I passed a poster for The Yards. It makes him look like a fallen angel painted by Caravaggio, moodily engulfed by shadows. Upstairs, in one of the hotel's hospitality suites, surrounded by bottles of water which had lost their fizz and bowls choked with cigarette butts, I met the 26-year-old owner of that glowering, alluring image. There was not much resemblance between them. His hair had been slept in and his clothes - creased shirt, greasy jeans, scuffed trainers - belied his apprenticeship as a Prada model. </p> <p>But once he began to talk, I understood the camera's infatuation with him. He is cinematic because he's so restlessly kinetic. The hotel armchair might have had hot bricks in it rather than cushions. His fingers anxiously shredded a scrap of paper, while his body twisted sideways like a corkscrew. The New Yorker's film critic Anthony Lane has said that Phoenix's face seems to have been squeezed in a vice; the rest of him is also pushed and pummelled by invisible forces. His slight frame houses a cyclone. </p> <p>Describing a cinematic fight with Mark Wahlberg - the blood brother who betrays him in The Yards - Phoenix re-enacted the struggle in the hotel room, concussing the perfumed air. 'Mark and I blocked it out of ourselves. We wanted it to be an epic battle, falling down the stairs and out on to the street. We had elbow pads and knee pads, but on the first take Mark just grabbed me with his pinkie, flipped me into the air and I landed on my head. Man, did I have a bump. I was black and blue for days. But I sure as hell wasn't gonna do any fucking John Wayne-style punching. I wanted it to be sloppy and barbaric and painful, like I'm hugging the life out of this guy who's my friend while I'm pounding at him.' </p> <p>He demonstrated on himself, pulling fistfuls of his hair and slamming the side of his skull. I remembered the astonishing scene in Gus Van Sant's To Die For in which Phoenix, a dim-witted slacker suborned by Nicole Kidman (who bribes him with blowjobs) to murder her husband, talks about vampires and turns himself into one, scratching at his own flesh as if it were anaesthetised, insentient, dead. The actor is someone who can replace his face at will. Phoenix, so frenetically physical, often seems to be trying to unscrew his own head. </p> <p>He was able to treat me to a solo performance of the fight with Wahlberg because both characters were slugging it out inside him. James Gray originally offered him Wahlberg's role of Leo, a convict plaintively trying to go straight. Phoenix favoured Willie: 'I said, \"I wanna play the charismatic one, the proactive guy\", just to get away from the post-To Die For thing, where I was always the loser. But I agreed to take Leo; then, after I'd been being him in my head for a year, they offered me Willie instead. So I spent a month going back and forth between them, trying to decide. I chose Willie because he was the sorta guy I hadn't been before. And when I became him, that was kinda shocking to my family - that I could be so obnoxious and strut and swagger about, being so goddamn suave, as this guy who just thought he was the man.' </p> <p>His family is Phoenix's touchstone of moral truth and emotional reality, and he endearingly explains the waywardness of Willie by saying: 'That kid had no secure parenting.' His parenting was secure, though unconventional. His mother and father were itinerant hippies, who happened to be disseminating the gospel of the Children of God in Puerto Rico when he was born. They named their offspring elementally or allegorically: the eldest was River (who overdosed on heroin and cocaine in 1993 and died on the asphalt of Sunset Boulevard while Joaquin, still a teenager, phoned for an ambulance in sobbing desperation), followed by Rain, Liberty and Summer. Joaquin felt that his own name (pronounced, significantly, Whack him) excluded him from the Aquarian tribe, and for a while experimentally called himself Leaf. </p> <p>Their parents fed them on tofu sandwiches and, when signing the toddlers up with a talent agency, specified that they would not do commercials for Coke, McDonald's, meat or milk. Engaged by Prada, Joaquin declined to wear leather shoes. He isvegan, though I wonder how his intake of cigarettes and his proud ownership of a yellow, '72 Le Mans sports car accord with these dietary and ecological dogmas. </p> <p> Although he claims not to have suffered from his vagabond, hand-to-mouth upbringing, it's remarkable how many of his characters are waifs, mentally precocious but emotionally vulnerable. In Ron Howard's Parenthood, aged only 15, he carried round a paper-bag full of porn flicks; he even described Commodus in Gladiator to me as 'a lost kid. Yeah, I discovered the child in him. He was only 19 when he became emperor. You know, the guy's father ran the Roman Empire, which is like the biggest multinational ever, and Commodus just hates the fucking suit and tie they make him wear!' </p> <p>By encouraging self-expression, the elder Phoenixes turned their children into instinctive actors. 'I'm not technical,' Joaquin said, his arms flailing, when I asked him about a scene near the end of The Yards in which, in an excruciating close-up, we watch a tear slowly form in the eye of the anguished thug. 'I don't have something I can just turn on. I sit there for hours in my trailer, hoping I can get into the mind of the guy I'm supposed to be. I don't think too much. I try to let go and suddenly [he flung his arms wide, like Leonardo DiCaprio riding the breeze on the prow of the Titanic] it's time to feel.' </p> <p>On Gladiator, Richard Harris helped him to liquefy by pouring booze into him. But eventually, he found his own way into Commodus. 'About two weeks in, I had an epiphany. I'd shot the beginning, with me arriving at the German camp, and I had some days off. So one morning I was studying the script, and lightning struck. I thought, \"Fuck ya! I geddit!\" I went out and cut my hair and added some weight. To start with, I was toned. But I made him flabbier, to show how this scrawny prince had kinda ripened into an emperor. It all happened because... no, I don't think I want to say what the epiphany was.' </p> <p>Self-expression for Phoenix entails self-denudation. Hence the borrowed, inherited garments shed by Commodus: 'We never see people pulling off their clothes in period films. But I though he'd be uncomfortable with those strangling collars and heavy cuffs. So why not take his shirt off?' </p> <p>Phoenix tore at his own shirt and exposed an unironed vest. The psychological striptease went even further as he remembered and re-enacted the abb\u00e9's crazed, quixotic effort to rescue Kate Winslet in Quills, discarding piety and propriety as he races to save her from flagellation. 'He sheds his armour, which is his cassock, and he runs through the rain with his shirt open, his chest bare.' By now, Phoenix had worked himself into a frenzy, ripping off clothes he wasn't actually wearing. And the end of the process was the revelation of naked, puny inadequacy. 'This guy thinks he's being so heroic, and we're going, \"You arsehole\". The joke of the movie is that there is no heroism in that world.' </p> <p> The Yards is already being compared to On the Waterfront, with Phoenix as a latterday Brando. But there is an earlier and, perhaps, more telling augury in To Die For. His character is called Jimmy; Kidman flatters him by calling him James, which reminds us that his mother called him after James Dean. Phoenix was modestly shifty when I made the comparison between their styles (or, if you like, their shared Method), and created a diversion by fumbling with a cigarette. 'Yeah, I guess I saw some of East of Eden when I was a kid. But only about 10 minutes of it and I couldn't see why everyone thought he was so amazing.' </p> <p>He paused, puffed meditatively, then decided to risk a further admission. 'Then I watched Rebel Without a Cause not so long ago.' Again he stopped, wistfully unreeling Dean's great, intimate, raw-nerved performance in his head. 'As a matter of fact,' he tentatively added, 'that was while I was on Gladiator.' He dragged on the cigarette, exhaled, and disappeared behind a thick grey cloud. When the fog cleared, I noticed that he was staring directly into my eyes, while a knowing grin sealed lips which were not prepared to say any more on the matter. </p> <p>But his smile confirmed my suspicion: he had told me, not in so many words, about his epiphany.</p>",

A life that you managed perfectly yourself becomes a minefield of tricky situations brought about by attempting to share responsibilities. </p> <p>Yet the coveted state of singledom continues to be seen as a compromise. When was the last time you heard somebody say pityingly, 'Poor thing, she's still married, you know' - yet that's exactly the sort of presumptuous insult that's hurled at the single dweller on a regular basis. This despite the fact that many marriages involve more misery and compromise than most people who choose to go it alone will experience in a lifetime. The accepted wisdom, that from the day we're born we're duty bound to seek out a like-minded person who'll make two become one, defies logic. You only need the most basic grasp of mathematics to know that two is always two. </p> <p>I had my macro Damascene revelation on the joys of being single about three years ago. It was early morning and the pale light of a wintry sun trickled through my bed-room curtains as I stretched myself diagonally over the expanse of my double bed. Wearing my recently departed ex's pyjama bottoms and my own vest, I shuffled into the kitchen and prepared myself a cappuccino and a bowl of cereal. Then, picking up the newspaper from my doorstep, I slipped back between the still-warm sheets. The radio alarm had switched itself on, and John Humphrys's sonorous tones were reassuring me that, despite a few hiccups, the world hadn't ended overnight. </p> <p>As I lolled around on my bed reading the news and trying to remember my plans for the day ahead, I experienced a quiver of smug contentment. No more breakfast television, no more checking my watch when I was enjoying the company of friends, no more declining of invitations from people who bored him or vice versa, as much theatre as I wanted, no more Sky Sport. The list of my blessings was endless. I was free. I was single again. After years of whining self pity during my regular phases of being single I'd suddenly realised that, far from a being punishment, it was an idyllic state to be savoured. </p> <p>Of course, you can write me off as being a smug yuppie with a comfortable lifestyle and a selfish nature. But you'd be wrong. My modicum of financial security was hard earned, and as for being single, I've tried as hard as anyone to make terrible relationships work. Yet it never occurred to me to rise to the converse challenge of creating a worthwhile lifestyle alone. Like most people in their late thirties, over the last 20 years I've succumbed to the lure of cohabitation on a few occasions. My ex-boyfriends remain good friends, but as I watch them fall like skittles into new unions, I find surprisingly that I don't envy them at all. I've no doubt that despite my best efforts I won't remain in this heavenly state uninterrupted, but the chances are I will return to it again, and again, and again. Marriage has an undeserved reputation as the only way of life worth aspiring to, cohabitation comes a close second, and the popular misconception is that no one would choose to be single. A faintly hypocritical scenario when you look at the state of modern relationships. In the clear light of day, and with the right attitude, going it alone offers many advantages. </p> <p>Nevertheless, being single, particularly as a woman, continues to get a bad press. Pitied (poor thing can't get a man), vilified (single-mum syndrome) or condescended to (isn't it time you grew up) but never celebrated as a chosen way of life. I don't want to turn this into a diatribe about the male of the species - in general I have only the fondest feelings for the opposite sex - but it does seem slightly unjust that when a man chooses to remain a bachelor, he's openly envied by his cohabiting friends and admired by the world at large. A woman in the same position finds none of that respect forthcoming, and can only pray that the day the label 'single' turns to 'spinster' is further away than her menopause. For centuries, men have been prolonging their 'merry bachelor' days. Is it mere coincidence that women only reach a similar jovial state when they become 'merry widows'? I suppose it stands to reason. If a woman has never had the 'official' stamp of approval from a man, then what on earth has she got to be happy about? </p> <p>Any declaration on the joys of being single is invariably met with a sympathetic smile and a pat on the head for being brave enough to pretend you're not suicidal. If you don't answer questions regarding your love life with a resigned shrug and an 'I'll try to do better' attitude, people think there's something wrong with you. No matter how good a time you're having as a single woman, you are expected to be a bit ashamed. It wouldn't do to turn up to a dinner party and boast about the incredible sex you had all weekend with a man you met at a fabulous party two weeks previous. 'What a shame you couldn't get a babysitter; don't even remember what time we left but we danced for hours.' The couples who weren't plain horrified at the notion of such grotesquely casual sex (funny how moralistic people get after they've settled down) would be consumed with envy disguised as sympathy for your delusional state. 'I honestly think she really believes she's enjoying herself,' accompanied by a caring shake of the head while you're happily showing off your bite marks to the person sitting next to you. </p> <p>Sex for the single girl is unquestionably a tricky issue. Even in these supposedly emancipated times, it's still regarded as an activity that men should take pride in doing a lot of and women should try hard to pretend they never indulge in - unless it's in a monogamous, long-term relationship. Well, we all make mistakes and the longevity of the relationship is something none of us can guarantee when, overcome by passion, we find ourselves cavorting on the sofa. Unless, of course, we have a hotline to Mystic Meg. </p> <p>Women may be less profligate with their sexual favours, but they get just as bored by regular bad sex, or indeed just the same old sex. A married girlfriend recently turned to me in fury when I questioned the wisdom of her flirtation with another man. 'You have no idea what it's like to sleep with the same man day in, day out for 15 years. Why shouldn't I have a tiny frisson of excitement in my life?' </p> <p>I'm not recommending infidelity, but she had a point. As Bridget Jones so rightly said, if every married person who condescendingly enquires as to whether you've 'found a boyfriend yet?' had to illuminate you on the last time they had exciting sex (or just sex), they would soon desist. 'Yes, I've found a boyfriend, two or three this year, actually! Oh sorry, don't look so disappointed; didn't mean to gloat. How's Charles?' </p> <p>Most of my married friends question me relentlessly about whom I'm dating in a way single friends fail to do. My independently minded friends aren't less interested, they're just way too busy living their own lives - something I'm afraid cohabitees stop doing the minute they start sharing a front door. How else do you explain the wistful look in their eyes when you tell them you're off to Vietnam for a month? The urgency of their messages when a newspaper reports on an alleged tryst with George Clooney? The obvious resentment when you're shopping together at the Gap and you buy yourself a leather skirt while they hunt for baby dungarees? </p> <p>Men understood way back the benefits of staying single for as long as possible. It wasn't an enlightened state brought about by superior intelligence, but during the Dark Ages only they had the wherewithal. Now, finally, women have the opportunity to enjoy the lifestyle they've worked hard to create. Only a lunatic would leap off that bandwagon having only just managed to manoeuvre your way on! The second your deposit account has upwards of a three-figure balance is surely not the time to throw in the towel and start procreating. The fun is only just beginning. Hooking up with someone involves such a plethora of compromises that just thinking about it makes me nervous. I haven't slogged my guts out for 20 years to spend my much-needed holidays with a man who wants to play Moby Dick on a sun lounger while I trail around the cultural hotspots desperately wishing I had a girlfriend there to keep me company. Or, worse still, not even getting to make those trips thanks to an endless stream of boring in-laws whose only interest is in whether you're up the duff yet. I have trouble enough trying to keep up with my own family without embracing the assorted dysfunction of somebody else's. </p> <p>I want to see the world, meet Machiavellian people, read more books, sleep in, stay out, spend three weeks in a row without switching the television on, eat toast and Marmite four times a day for a month. None of those minor indulgences seem possible once you've let a partner muscle in on your life. Yet I have to listen to endless diatribes from unsingle buddies trying to convince me (and more frequently themselves) that life has perked up since they found someone to push the trolley around Sainsbury's for them. I can let weeks go by without venturing anywhere near a supermarket. Contrary to popular perception, when I open the fridge door and discover only a bottle of delicious wine and a bag of prunes (instead of several varieties of fruit juice and a winebox that hides the telltale signs of tippling) I'm not depressed for a moment. Instead I'm beside myself with relief that it's not full of snack-sized Babybels and six-packs of hideous fruit yogurts. </p> <p>The other day I found myself plucking the ends off a bag full of exotic salad leaves because my friend's husband doesn't enjoy the stems. 'Tell him to do it himself,' I finally snapped when the mundanity of my task grew too much to bear and the gales of laughter from the guests in the sitting room too enticing. 'That's the sort of attitude that explains why you'll never find a husband,' she retorted. Was it churlish of me to point out that that's one of the myriad reasons I don't want another husband at present? </p> <p> For, yes, I too once fell by the wayside. Marriage is something that, with the benefit of hindsight, I now consider on a par with smoking - a bad habit that you either pick up when you're young, or manage to avoid until you're old enough not to care about the repercussions. I leapt enthusiastically into that cauldron at the age of 18 and back out again three years later with third-degree emotional burns. Friends often ask why I don't describe myself as a divorc\u00e9e. When I ask why I should, they mumble an answer which even they are embarrassed to be verbalising. Being divorced is still considered a step better than single, apparently. It means someone once wanted you. No surprise, then, that 'spinster' is by definition a woman who was never lucky enough to marry, yet bachelors remain bachelors forever if they so desire. Society wants to be able to easily identify these poor, failed specimens so we can learn by their mistakes. I'm sorry to disappoint, but I'm less proud of the fact I made an error once than I am of my choice to remain independent ever since. </p> <p>When you ask people to define single, they often find themselves at a loss for words. Does it mean someone who lives alone? Someone who's not dating? In that case, I wasn't single last week; I'm single at present; but between now and the New Year, I'll probably only be single for a couple of weeks. The whole notion of singledom in an era of escalating divorce rates, when unconventional liaisons often outlive their more conventional friends' unions, is faintly ridiculous. It's also a label that only counts in the eye of the beholder. Unless I take out an ad in a national newspaper to announce my union with another or have sex publicly and regularly with one partner, I will continue to be perceived as single. What I do in my private life and the privacy of my own bedroom, or his, or wherever else we choose, doesn't alter my status unless I make a public declaration. One of the happiest couples I know lives in separate flats in the same building. Are they single or just plain happy? It makes you wonder if the only reason we do get married or cohabit is to convince other people that we're not repulsive. </p> <p>The independence of a career introduces the possibility of choosing to live alone, and it's an improvement to the status quo that my generation seem all too happy to embrace. Remember, we've lived through the Ice Storm era. Watched our parents fight their way through unhappy marriages or deal with society's disapproval if they chose to escape. That scourge of society, a single mother, raised me. With no money and no man to speak of, she brought up four functional, participating members of society. Five, if you count me! Now she's finally enjoying her 'state of independence' holidays with friends to Spain or Italy, weekends at music festivals in Wales - she never seems to have a spare moment.The opportunity to have similar choices without waiting for my widow's pension is a legacy my mother and her generation fought hard to be able to hand down. I'm not so naive as to believe you can have it all, but you've certainly got to try and get your paws on as much as possible while you can. </p> <p>Perhaps my own experiences of 'happy coupledom' have something to do with my reticence to share door keys at present. They say that living alone is lonely, but I don't think I've ever felt as alone as in the twilight months of a relationship when a once-busy double bed has become as wide and desolate as Antarctica. The possibility of reaching out for comfort from the other side is as ridiculous as warming your hands on an ice cube. </p> <p>Other low points of cohabitation include the plentiful nights I spent during one four-year tryst sitting at home with my lovingly prepared dinner for two while my partner went AWOL in the Bermuda triangle of Notting Hill pubs. During another relationship, I experienced the most miserable day of my working life. My partners dispensed with my services and my hitherto loyal assistant, with whom I'd been planning to set up a new business, deserted me for their offer of a new car. I called my boyfriend in tears and he offered to leave work early and meet me at home for crisis counselling. I raced back longing for a shoulder to cry and instead found myself weeping into my own chest for much of the night. He finally stumbled in at 2am mumbling about a prior engagement. Nowadays when I'm in trouble I know where to turn. </p> <p> Friendships are the one essential ingredient to a happy life that no single person can afford to underestimate. In the old days, the accepted form of behaviour when you managed to grab hold of a partner was to ditch your pals. Post singledom, your main contact was on the rare occasions when you tried to set them up with someone else. Again an arrogant assumption that what they really, really want is to be just like you. The 'libbers' of old may have been comrades on the picket line, but they kept one eye on their 'sisters in arms' to make sure they weren't running off with their husbands. They still lived in a dog eat dog world where hanging on to your man was imperative - perhaps the reason that old retainers like Fay Weldon and Janet Street Porter still rarely have a good word to say about their own sex. </p> <p>Nowadays we tend to value friendship much more than the opportunity of a leg-over with a pal's husband. For the post-marriage generation, friendship has established itself as the most stable relationship on offer. My friends and I joke about putting our savings into a farmhouse in Tuscany that we can share when we're old and incontinent. We plan on wheeling each other around and reminiscing while making passes at our hunky young gardeners. Friends are for life, while boyfriends tend to come and go. It's your friends who'll prop you up when your relationship crumbles, or you lose your job or life just gets too much. </p> <p>Of course there are lonely days and empty nights, but not just for people who choose to live alone - times when you want a cuddle and there's nobody there, or medicinal sex and not with a stranger. And of course the perfect relationship is an enticing dream. I used to experience physical heartache when watching an ex-boyfriend's parents together. They'd been married for 50 years, and yet when they danced with each other, they still looked like honeymooners. They used to wander around their own garden hand in hand, for heaven's sake! </p> <p>In this fractured world, that sort of 'happy marriage' is becoming an oxymoron. I'd like to have children and hope it will be with someone who adds another dimension to my life. It's true that one can never make two, but if you're lucky two can sometimes be better than one. Especially when they go on to make three and four. Meanwhile, and maybe forever, I intend to gobble up the world in gargantuan chunks. I have a suspicion that spending more time on enjoying your life and less time on seeking a partner may ultimately be the secret to both. One thing's for sure, though. Sitting around moping and waiting for Lancelot is a waste of time. And that's one thing you never have enough of.</p>",
  "At one o'clock tomorrow afternoon, Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, will sit down to a light buffet lunch with a small group of men in his office in Queen Anne's Gate in London. Over smoked salmon sandwiches and sparkling mineral water, they will review the war so far and look forward to the battles that lie ahead. On the sofas around the low coffee table will be Straw's junior Ministers, their aide, and a handful of key advisers. The weekly meetings tend to be informal and convivial. Tomorrow, the mood will be sterner. <p>The next 10 days may see Britain plunged into chaos not seen since the late Seventies. Protests against fuel prices will rage up and down the country. Motorways will be jammed with convoys of trucks; airports ringed with trailers. Fishing boats will block the Thames. Petrol stations will be out of fuel and supermarkets out of food. There will be running battles with the police. In September Britain staggered badly as protests flashed from Dartmouth to Dundee. This time, the protesters hope, Britain will be stretched full length on the tarmac. </p> <p>But, if Straw and his people have done their work well, there will be nothing more than a couple of heavily policed demonstrations and a few minor disruptions. They may distract momentarily from the chaos on the railways and the floods. The activists' hopes of forcing a cut in fuel tax, let alone a general election, will look risible. By the end of the month they will be back in their farmhouses and haulage firm offices with their exhaust pipes firmly between their legs. </p> <p>One of the biggest and most sophisticated operations of its kind ever run by a British government - involving tens of thousands of people from press officers to the head of MI5, from Army generals to low-level union officials - will have worked. The battle will have been won. </p> <p>At the Muir Town Lodge Hotel on the bleak shores of the Moray Firth in northern Scotland, there was talk of revolution last Wednesday night at an open meeting of the People's Fuel Lobby (PFL). Mark Francis, a haulier from Rhyl in Wales and a leader of the PFL, told the crowd that their cause was right and that if they held firm they would win the fight. </p> <p>The crowd listened carefully. Then several stood up to talk. A housewife said the cost of fuel was ruining her budget; a tourist worker said coaches couldn't afford to drive up from England to the Highlands. After two and a half hours, the meeting broke up. Within hours PFL leaders were heading for Newcastle and another planning session. </p> <p>Their aim is simple: to repeat what happened two months ago. Then, a dozen or so committed men caused chaos on a scale not seen in Britain for nearly 20 years. They forced the Government on to the defensive and, for one astonishing week, rode an unprecedented wave of public support. Only when the supermarkets were out of bread and milk, when hospitals cut back operations, when most fuel stations were out of petrol, did they end their protests. Almost overnight the blockades outside the oil refineries and the convoys jamming the motorways disappeared. </p> <p>But the activists, an ad hoc alliance of the frantic, the fanatic and the plain fed-up, did not end their protests unconditionally. Unless Gordon Brown, the Chancellor, made some move to lessen the burden of high fuel prices then, they made clear, the blockades would be back. Their deadline expires a week tomorrow. This Wednesday Brown is due to make his 'pre-Budget statement'. He is not expected to give much, if any, ground. The activists' demands of a 26p cut in the tax on fuel has fallen on deaf ears. There will be no 'hand-outs'. </p> <p>Brown and the protesters agree on one thing: if you want a fight, they are both saying, you can have one. And the fight will be fierce. </p> <p>'At the end of the day we are going to cause as much mayhem as possible,' Nigel Kime, a Lincolnshire haulier at the forefront of September's protests, told The Observer last week. </p> <p>Even the protesters don't yet know quite what form that mayhem will take. The aim is to cause disruption across the country. Last time oil refineries and fuel terminals were the primary target. But, as the oil firms have boosted defences - Shell's Stanlow refinery now boasts new concrete barriers - they may not be an initial target this time. Other plans include: </p> <p> \u0095 using trucks to blockade food distribution centres; </p> <p> \u0095 disrupting the National Grid by switching on farming and light industrial machinery to create surges of demand; </p> <p> \u0095 creating roadblocks by draining vehicles of fuel; </p> <p> \u0095 holding protests across railway lines to halt trains; </p> <p> \u0095 blockading milk depots; </p> <p> \u0095 organising small-scale strikes among supporters; </p> <p> \u0095 and demonstrating outside the homes of Labour MPs. </p> <p>Even before the expiry of the 13 November deadline some protesters will already be on the road. A convoy of lorries and tractors will leave Jarrow on Friday and head south at 25 mph through Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and Milton Keynes. A second convoy will leave John O'Groats heading for Edinburgh. By the time the main protest reaches London, on 14 November, the organisers hope it will be causing traffic queues 100 miles long. </p> <p>It will end - if the police let it - with a rally in Hyde Park. At the same time a fleet of trawlers will block the Thames. The protesters hope they can snarl up the capital for a week. </p> <p>'Seven days in London should present us with no problems,' says Kime, 37. 'If we end up stuck on the M25, then so be it. If we block up London, then we can seriously damage three major airports.' </p> <p>The key organiser is David Handley, a Monmouthshire farmer who heads the PFL and the more militant Farmers For Action. Handley, 48, has more than \u00a340,000 of debts and has been protesting on behalf of farmers for five years. His dairy farm, rented from Monmouthshire County Council, could soon be taken from him. </p> <p>Handley has left the running of his 88-acre property to his wife and dedicated himself to his campaigns. His boast that he can trigger protests practically anywhere at anytime is not idle. A 'bush telegraph' of mobile phones connecting hundreds of activists has been proven effective. </p> <p>He is not alone. Many, especially in north Wales, will be looking to Brynle Williams, a hillfarmer from near Mold, for leadership. Williams set the protesters' 60-day deadline and led the first protests in September. His associates say they are ready to go to jail. </p> <p>'Let them arrest us. Let's see how big their jail cells really are,' said Clive Swan, a neighbour of Williams's. </p> <p>Police and protesters worry that a few hotheads will hijack the demonstrations. There is evidence of infiltration from far right-wing organisations. There has also been interest from the left, from both anarchist groups and the Socialist Workers' Party. 'I am very worried. As soon as anything violent happens I'm off home,' said Rhys Parry, a farmer who co-ordinates protests in South Wales. </p> <p>The demonstrators' actions will put larger organisations sympathetic to their aims in a difficult position. The Road Haulage Association, the National Farmers Union and the Countryside Alliance all officially oppose direct action. But they face enormous pressure from members who support the protests. Handley is a member of the CA, and Williams is an official in the NFU. For everybody concerned the stakes are high. </p> <p>The Government's planning started in earnest on 18 September, days after the end of the last protests, with a meeting of a 'Fuel Task Force' in the Cabinet Office and of the Civil Contingency Committee, the Government's key crisis management unit. </p> <p>Blair and Straw knew they had to get it right. In the aftermath of the first blockades, the Tories overtook Labour in the polls, albeit fleetingly, for the first time since the 1992 election. The pair agreed that the Government had appeared to lose control. </p> <p>Their strategy was careful and clever. The Government worked out the threats they faced, then moved to eliminate them. One of Straw's first acts was to order one of the biggest undercover operations against non-terrorist targets in Britain for 20 years. </p> <p>Every local police force's Special Branch began to gather intelligence on the main leaders of the protests. The local media was monitored. Dossiers were compiled of activists' police records, finances and political views. Many were put under 'soft' surveillance. </p> <p>The Observer has learnt that operatives from MI5, the domestic security service, infiltrated a number of the more aggressive groups. Their information was critical in determining the Government's tactics. The divisions within the activists - particularly between Williams and Handley - were key. </p> <p>'It was perfect,' one intelligence source said. 'It played to one of this government's greatest strengths.' </p> <p>One of the first lessons learned from the September crisis was the importance of winning public opinion early. The Home Office and Downing Street agreed that a seven-day campaign of media management was needed. Those seven days ended yesterday. </p> <p>Last week was chosen as 'fuel week' because it looked like it would be quiet. Downing Street allowed only one key announcement a day. </p> <p>First, two Sunday newspapers were briefed about plans to use the military to make sure fuel got through. When The Observer had run the story a week earlier, government press officers downplayed it. Now they cranked as hard as they could. </p> <p>On Monday Straw urged people to 'get in stocks' and spoke of the threat to the NHS. On Tuesday and Wednesday Blair repeatedly said the Government would not act when threatened. At the end of the week Straw rammed the message home. </p> <p>There was a more aggressive side to the press campaign too. In September Handley had depicted himself as a Spartacus of the shires, a reasonable man pushed unwillingly to extreme action. It was essential to discredit him. </p> <p>Soon journalists came to hear, from concerned and anonnmous callers, about splits among the activists. Then came suggestions that Handley's business affairs might be worth looking at. One senior union official called him a 'latter-day Arthur Scargill'. A report detailing 180 alleged violent incidents directed at tanker drivers during the last protests was made public. Soon tabloid headlines were branding Handley a 'dangerous fool'. </p> <p>There was spin elsewhere too. Again and again spokesmen repeated that to cut fuel taxes would mean taking money from elsewhere. Predictably they said the money would come from the health service or pensioners. The storms battering the UK helped too. Global warming was highlighted as Ministers suddenly got very green. </p> <p>And, if the going does get tough, the Government has covered its flanks. </p> <p>The oil firms are well on board. During the first protests, when tanker drivers refused to cross picket lines, their relationship with Whitehall looked tense. Now they have pledged to Straw that they will do everything, without jeopardising drivers' safety, to get the tankers out. </p> <p>Essential services are now prepared - a clear contrast with last time. On 26 October, every NHS trust, local health authority, medical supply agency and the National Blood Service received a fax and email from Neil McKay, then the Acting Chief Executive of the NHS, suggesting they stockpile supplies and draw up contingency plans. </p> <p>Many petrol stations are storing three times as much fuel as usual. Thousands of companies and millions of individuals are taking their own precautions, buying storage tanks and jerry cans and filling up. Yesterday panic buying was continuing in southern England. The north was calmer, though there were problems in Liverpool. </p> <p>In the last resort the Government will use force. The policing of demonstrations will be far tougher than two months ago. Senior policemen say protesters are guilty of a criminal act even when just plotting to break the law. Pickets can be arrested for obstructing a public highway - as could slow-moving lorry drivers - or causing a breach of the peace. During the miners' strike pickets were prevented from travelling. 'There's no reason why we can't do the same now,' a former police officer and key government adviser said. Truckers have been warned that they face losing their operating licences if they break the law. </p> <p>And the Government has one last ace to play. A thousand soldiers are ready to drive tankers, more can drive trucks and several hundred men are trained to run the refineries. Between them they will ensure the fuel gets out. </p> <p>But the wild card is the public. The Government's control of public opinion is not as strong as it would like and opinion polls have shown support for the protesters is still high. There is a deep-seated conviction that the fuel tax - currently \u00a337 out of a \u00a350 fuel bill - is too high. There is a temptation to see deeper themes: the city against the country, the capital against the provinces, the urbanite Europhiles against those who have a very different view of what Britain is and should be. </p> <p>But, say academics, the emergence of a group of largely middle-class protesters signals the erosion of Britain's traditional class system rather than a reinforcement of divisions. New alignments are yet to be properly defined. </p> <p>Professor Rodney Barker, an expert on British civil disobedience at the London School of Economics, said: 'I could not have imagined this happening here 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago. The fuel protesters may look like an anomaly, but they might well be a sign of things to come.'</p>",
  "<p><strong>Beethoven's Hair: an Extraordinary Historical Odyssey and a Musical Mystery Solved</strong><br>Russell Martin<br>Bloomsbury \u00a314.99, pp256<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000094368,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>So singular this author's prose style that I had to consult the dust-jacket to find out if English (or American English) is his native language. It is. Since he was reportedly paid a six-figure sum to write this book about a peripatetic lock of Beethoven's hair, it is worth paying close attention to learn the secrets of his technique. The following sentence is typical: 'Utterly unmentioned throughout the three decades since she had joined the Fremming family, the hair and the black locket that contained it simply had lain in a drawer in the doctor's desk.' </p> <p>Fortunately, the writer has taken the trouble not to utterly unmention his editor by name, so we know whom to thank for this not unarresting ungracefulness which crashes across the page every few lines. Composite adjectives play havoc with syntax: Prince Razumovsky is 'battered by the bottomed-out economy' and Beethoven suffers from 'long-battered health', while the 'surely fear-racked owner' of the lock of hair goes missing once the Second World War 'dramatically was under way'. </p> <p>In general, however, the author adds rather than subtracts. Verbal frills adorn each phrase like decorous doilies. People 'opine', events 'commence', Beethoven 'employs' paper and 'pens' a letter. Bathos is raised to a high art. Beethoven's life is 'laced with enormous accomplishments'. His mother's death 'was a terrible blow to the whole family'. The news that the Germans had surrendered in 1945 is 'stupendous'. </p> <p>If the syntax is clotted, the story itself is painfully etiolated, stretched thin over more than 250 pages where a third as many would do. Without index, reference, footnote or bibliography, fact and guesswork are indistinguishable. The reader skates blindly, longing for a safety rail on which to cling but finding only a red herring hanging at the end of a line. The bald facts, repeated with maddening monotony, concern a clump of hair said to have been snipped from Beethoven's head at the time of his death by an acolyte, Ferdinand Hiller. </p> <p>Passed from father to son, this hair apparent eventually turned up in Denmark in 1943 during the Nazi occupation, handed to a Danish doctor by an unknown Jewish refugee he had helped to safety. The author brings events up to date with its sale (at Sotheby's in 1994) to two Americans, a collector and a urologist, who respectively bear the stunningly improbable names of Ira Brilliant and 'Che' Guevara. </p> <p>A parallel tale relates the scientific examination of samples of the hair, and the resultant conclusions as to Beethoven's state of health - not too good by all accounts: inflamed bowels, nose bleeds, frequent vomiting, swollen abdomen, jaundice, pneumonia and liver failure. </p> <p>Despite the book's subtitle, music doesn't feature, except as a background list, interspersed as a third narrative, of the composer's 'enormous accomplishments'. The absence of morphine in Beethoven's raped lock and the presence, instead, of lead - the chief findings of the scientists' tests - is of circumstantial rather than musical interest. Would they have known from this trichonometry the more relevant fact that Beethoven was deaf? </p> <p>Much is made of the discovery that he wrote his final works racked with pain rather than soothed with sedative. Our ears tell us that already, but who are we to split such trivial hairs?</p>",
  "<p><strong>Marquis de Sade: Letters From Prison</strong><br>translated by Richard Seaver<br>Harvill \u00a320, pp402</p> <p>In advance of the forthcoming film Quills, in which a leering Geoffrey Rush overplays the incarcerated sodomite, this is the definitive collection of Sade's correspondence. It is notable primarily for its lack of carnal interest. The letters are written from the dungeons of Vincennes and the Bastille, and from the asylum of Charenton in which he was held, on charges of 'offence against the morals of the kingdom' from 1777 for 13 years, until he was 50. Most are directed to his wife: lugubrious, impassioned, self-absorbed entreaties for her to be more attendant on his every sacrosanct whim. </p> <p>In one, for example, he requests a shopping list of absolute essentials to make his stay in his subterranean cell more bearable: 'Two dozen meringues and two dozen lemon cakes from the Palais Royal pastry shop; the architectural plans for the new Italian Opera in Paris; a dark green jacket, with a silk fringe, with or without silver, the size being the same as the one the tailor sent me a fortnight ago; some chocolate; and a little dog, preferably a pup, so that I may have the pleasure of raising it, either a spaniel or a setter...' </p> <p>Otherwise, he uses his apparently unlimited quotas of paper and ink to harangue his mother-in-law, Madame de Montreuil, who initially turned him in while he was attendant on his own mother's deathbed: 'Remember, Madame, that you will never derive any good from making my soul more savage and my heart more immune to feeling, the only possible results of the frightful state to which you have had me put.' </p> <p>As if to prove the point, Sade, never a man to stand on ceremony, in prison conceived of the works which made his name, and destroyed that of his family: Justine, Juliette and Philosophy in the Bedroom. Apollinaire once called him, somewhat grandly, 'the freest soul who ever lived' and, in chains, he let his imagination run riot, counting himself lord of infinite space.</p> <p>His letters, however, make scant mention of his literary or libidinous ambitions and are evidence more of his place within what he called 'an age of total corruption'. There are, thus, plea bargains for manservants and ever more urgent demands for oculists as his eyesight fails by candlelight; moreover, he employs every rhetorical device at his disposal in a vain effort to use family influence to hasten his release. </p> <p>When this liberation is not forthcoming the letters seem to become a vehicle of his enforced impotence - 'I am most assuredly not incapable of writing you,' he explains to his long-suffering wife at one point (as if she were in any doubt), 'and the day I am, for fear of worrying you, knowing how you feel about me, I shall manage so well that you won't even notice it.' </p> <p>At least, in them, he appears to sublimate his sexual frustrations into his sentence construction, which is often engorged and always tortured.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hans Christian Andersen: The LIfe of a Storyteller</strong><br>Jackie Wullschlager<br>Allen Lane/ The Penguin Press \u00a320, pp506<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501840350,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>The Harry Potter phenomenon, coming after Tolkien, sets off many chimes. The thirst for fairy-tales and allegories, for the domestication of the supernatural, looks to be universal. It is incised in the child and in the fertile mysteries of childhood as these survive in adult men and women.</p> <p>Fairy-tales join hands across time and space, across cultures and languages. The Argonauts become intergalactic warriors; Cinderella darkens into the fable of the three daughters in King Lear; a thousand tales of 'impossible' tasks to perform echo back to the labours of Hercules. Surrealism and science-fiction are derivative from the unrealities, consoling or menacing, of fairyland. Sirens and mermaids sing the great seas of our dreams, themselves voyages, from Homer to Walcott. </p> <p>This universality, this compelling mixture of 'childishness' and enigmatic depths, of laughter and desolation, has long intrigued psychologists. Freud analysed fairy-tales, seeking to unriddle in their spell the suppressed impulses of childhood traumas and nascent sexuality. </p> <p>Jung probed deeper, perceiving in their ubiquity, in the shocks of recognition they bring to us, certain archetypes of the human psyche, certain universal configurations of narrative which are remembered subconsciously and collectively. Like no other mental pattern, the fairy-tale, the metamorphosis of beauty into beast, of pauper into prince, leads us back, like the 'background noise' in modern cosmology, to the origins of the human psyche. </p> <p>The iceberg mass of the world's fairy-tales is anonymous. It arises from sources and occasions, from reveries and metaphoric imaginings innocent of authorship. The elves and imps, the talking animals and witches, the lost children and foundlings which people the landscapes of even the earliest cultures, come late. Millennia of animate shadows precede them. And even at his most inventive, the known, modern master of the genre will draw heavily on the shared inventory, on the global conventions of the genre. Charles Perrault's 'Mother Goose' or 'Puss-in-Boots' draw on a dense layer of folk-tales. </p> <p>The brothers Grimm are inspired collectors of German folk-lore, of tales festive and horrific which had been told and embroidered upon at the fire-side for centuries. The 'invention' of any fundamental motif, of a story that will enter and remain in our common remembrance, is exceedingly rare (if it exists at all). No one came closer to that magical turn than did Hans Christian Andersen. </p> <p>As Jackie Wullschlager shows in her finely documented and insightful biography, so much in Andersen's life had its direct reflection in his inspired fancies. His childhood was one of frequent misery. </p> <p>Seeking employment as a playwright or actor, the 'ugly duckling', during 1820-1822, hung on in Copenhagen virtually starving. Nothing in his harrowed personality seemed to give grounds for hope, except a nascent genius for friendship and the occasional stroke of luck out of the blue, precisely as in fairy-tales. </p> <p>Recognition came almost overnight with the publication, in the mid-1830s, of Andersen's first masterpieces. He was, before long, a European celebrity, the recipient of a royal annuity, the object of caring generosity among wealthy friends and patrons. But no measure of literary glory and material reward could ever efface the deep scars left by Andersen's early years, by the humiliations in his background (his aunt ran a brothel) and by the disappointments which attached to the manifest failings of his 'serious' fiction. Only a master of pain could have written the secret sufferings of 'The Little Mermaid'. </p> <p>As has no previous biographer, notably in Denmark, Wullschlager tackles the absolutely crucial but opaque question of Hans Christian Andersen's sexuality. She does so with unfailing tact and a salutary resistance to psychoanalytic facilities. Andersen made no secret of infatuations with women, notably with the great singer, Jenny Lind. Landed and aristocratic ladies drew his adoring gaze. There is, however, no proof that he experienced heterosexual relations, not even during his visits to prostitutes late in his life. </p> <p>The fundamental homoeroticism, on the other hand, is manifest from the outset. It generated passionate longings for a number of male friends, for a prince of the German imperial house, for a bevy of younger male travelling companions. Ardent letters and kisses abound. 'Do not judge me by ordinary standards,' pleaded Andersen, in a social climate all but closed to open homosexuality (yet rife with its practice). Yet again, there is no convincing evidence of consummation. Only of aching need and rhetoric. Here also, it is the tangled ambiguities of the fairy-tales which come as near as Andersen dared to revelation. </p> <p>It may be that Andersen's obsessive travels, his febrile restlessness as he moved from lodging to lodging in Copenhagen, are a surrogate for a symbolic and psychic compensation in respect of erotic unfulfilment. One feels dizzy at Wullschlager's picturesque chronicle. Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal - voyage after voyage, under often strenuous conditions. Lionised in England, Andersen overstayed his welcome as Dickens's house-guest. </p> <p>Jackie Wullschlager's account of the meeting between these two virtuosi of childhood anguish and unfolding is a delight. Though in failing health, the pied piper continued to chase across Europe and Denmark in pursuit, perhaps, of that elusive ice-maiden who haunts one of his last and most poignant tales. Andersen's funeral, in August 1875, was a national occasion. </p> <p>One would value a more substantial look at the exceedingly complex mutual awareness of Andersen and of Kierkegaard. Wisely, it may be, this book avoids speculating at any depth on the stylistic and psychological means whereby the teller of tales transmutes an often bizarre, localised happening or hallucination into a universal d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu, into a homecoming for children and grown-ups everywhere. Wullschlager ignores the pretentious mists and jargon of deconstruction or postmodernism. Her work is proudly old-fashioned and gives off a classic sparkle. It will bring joy under the Christmas tree, where Hans Christian Andersen belongs.</p>",
  "Kabul's Hotel Intercontinental is a ghostly place these days. Built by the British in 1970, it was once at the centre of Afghanistan's tourist industry. <p>Guests would take a dip in the pool, before proceeding to the ballroom or relaxing at the bar with a glass of Afghan wine. Last week, however, there were three guests. There were 120 staff on hand, in case more turned up. </p> <p>But the boutiques, the old Soviet travel agency, Intourist, the American Express counter, and the barber's shop were all dark and deserted. </p> <p>All this might change, however, if Afghanistan's uncompromising Islamic rulers have their way. In the face of continuing isolation from the outside world, the Taliban are now making an ingenious attempt to win international approval. They want to revive the country's once lucrative tourist industry. </p> <p>In a symbol of a gradual thaw in Kabul, the Taliban have eased restrictions on visas for Western tourists. With 95 per cent of the country now under their control, and four years after they swept into Kabul, the Taliban claim Afghanistan is once again a safe holiday destination. 'We extend a warm welcome to foreign tourists,' Abdul Rahman Hotaki, the Deputy Minister for Cultural Affairs, said yesterday. 'We would like them to visit our war-torn country.' </p> <p>Tourism used to be worth $25 million a year, Hotaki said. His government was now trying to 'improve facilities' to attract more guests. The 'top priority' was to prevent further damage to Afghanistan's unique heritage, which includes relics from Greek, Buddhist and Islamic dynasties. </p> <p>If sanctions were lifted, more restoration work could be done, he said. 'We are all members of the world family. Contact with foreign countries will bring changes in our policies and way of living.' </p> <p>Three months ago Mullah Muhammad Omah, the Taliban's reclusive leader, issued a decree saying Afghanistan's most famous archaeological attraction - two giant Buddha statues in the remote Bamiyan valley - should be preserved. There were, he pointed out, no Buddhists left in Afghanistan to worship them. But he added: 'The government considers the Bamiyan statues as an example of a potential major source of income for Afghanistan from international visitors.The Taliban states that Bamiyan shall not be destroyed but be protected.' </p> <p>The statement represented a U-turn by the iconoclastic Taliban movement, which two years ago tried to blow the Buddhas up. After seizing the valley, fighters dynamited the head of the small Buddha and fired rockets at the large Buddha's groin. The attack damaged frescoes which had survived since the third century and provoked international dismay. Last year a Taliban commander placed explosives behind the remaining head and returned recently to dump two burning tyres on the statue's chin. Sources suggest he has now been arrested. The Taliban dismiss reports that they have damaged the Buddhas as 'foreign propaganda'. </p> <p>Over the summer, a handful of tourists found their way into Afghanistan - the first recent visitors to do so after 20 years of war and Soviet occupation. In August, two British travellers visited Bamiyan. Other backpackers turned up this month in Herat, Afghanistan's ancient cultural centre, close to the Iranian border. </p> <p>The revival of the hippy trail, which saw thousands of students and Peace Corps volunteers descend on Kabul's Chicken Street en route to India, is clearly a far-off prospect. But with the war now confined to the extreme north-east, Afghanistan is accessible again for the first time in a generation. </p> <p>'The hippies who came in their hordes in the Seventies didn't just come for the hashish, they also came for the wonderful Afghan hospitality,' Brigitte Neubacher, of the Islamabad-based Society for the Preservation of Afghanistan's Cultural Heritage, said. 'Afghanistan is one of the most beautiful places in the world. The landscape is unspoilt, the sky is spectacular, and there is no pollution.' The country had been the victim of 'devastating propaganda', she complained. </p> <p>There are major obstacles for would-be tourists. Much of the country is still extensively mined. The relics of Soviet occupation from tanks to field guns haunt the mountainous landscape. It takes at least two weeks to get a visa, only obtainable from Pakistan, one of three countries that recognises the Taliban. </p> <p>Once in Kabul, tourists have to check in with the Foreign Ministry and collect a government translator. Foreign women are obliged to cover their heads. </p> <p>In Kabul itself, most of the tourist sites have been destroyed. The museum has been looted. The art gallery survives but shows only innocuous landscapes in accordance with the Taliban edict forbidding the human image. The zoo contains a blind lion, Shir, a few wolves and some unhappy owls. In Chicken Street, the only visitors to the carpet shops and jewellery boutiques are foreign aid workers. </p> <p>The drive to attract visitors is prompted by the regime's desire to revive a collapsed economy and by frustration at its failure to win international recognition. Faiz Ahmad Faiz, the Taliban's foreign affairs spokesman, said: 'We have brought stability and tranquillity to Afghanistan. We have the support of the people. We want only peaceful relations with other countries.'</p>",
  "<b> Margherita Taylor: </b> It was a memorable first meeting. Dermot and I had been paired up on a pilot for a sports show, No Balls Allowed . It was a long day because it really wasn't working between us. He's a perfectionist, so we kept having to do things over and over again. And when he couldn't remember a line, he'd hit his head really hard with his shoe. It scared me - I didn't know him. After that, I didn't think we'd ever see each other again. <p> No Balls was low budget. We had to really rough it and that brought us closer together. By the time T4 started, we knew each other inside out. We both really wanted it to work. We're both passionate about what we do, so we'd put in the extra hours, make sure we knew the script backwards, and work on making it funnier and more creative. The banter was the way we were in real life, and we became these two exaggerated characters on screen. Dermot would muck things up and I'd tell him off. I was quite motherly. I was the one who would say, 'Let's rehearse this again. Have you done your homework?' Now I think we are much more equal: what you see on screen is 100 per cent what you get off screen. </p> <p>We rely on each other a lot. When you're live in front of a couple of million people, you need to make sure the person sitting next to you is going to cover your back if you get it wrong. Dermot knows how I'm going to finish a sentence or how I'm going to start it. I trust him 100 per cent. </p> <p>Dermot's a real pro. I rate him among the top five presenters in the country, along with Johnny Vaughan and Chris Evans. Now, after he's done The Big Breakfast, people are finally seeing how talented he is. </p> <p>In a recent interview, he described me as 'his mum, his girlfriend and his sister rolled into one'. It's true. I was very nervous when I had to present the Dancestar 2000 Awards and I needed a hug from Dermot, in the same way a girlfriend would want a hug from her boyfriend. But even though we're both single, it's best to keep our relationship as it is. We work well like that. I wouldn't want to find out that Dermot doesn't wash his socks or picks his nose. </p> <p> <b> Dermot O'Leary: </b> I'd seen Margherita on Videotec and heard her on Capital Radio. So when we both turned up for the No Balls pilot, people knew who she was. I've never felt star-struck with anyone, but there was this certain pressure, especially when you're trying to get a job. My Achilles heel has always been learning lines. I used to have a tendency to hit myself when I couldn't remember them. It was essentially a day of self-flagellation. I went away thinking: a) I haven't got the job, and b) I'm never going to work ever again, because that girl thinks I'm a lunatic. </p> <p>Although we had a really good time doing No Balls Allowed, the first T4 was what really broke the ice. It was our first live show. We'd meet up night after night, just panicking. It was mutual fear that brought us together. </p> <p>We have a very natural friendship. There's no sexual tension. I look at her and I think she looks fabulous, but I never once think, I'll ask her out. It would be like sleeping with your sister. She's one of the most attractive girls anyone could know, but I genuinely recoil at the thought of even kissing her. I'm not particularly laddish, but when I'm around her, you always sense there's a school mam in the room - in the nicest possible way. She's always telling me off. She tells me off for swearing. She's like Mary Poppins. MT is the black Mary Poppins. If I start flirting with girl guests, she'll warn them off. She's totally like my mum. </p> <p>MT is my safety net. When we go out live, we both back each other up. She'll always pick up where I left off. I act like a football manager to her and she to me; we're always giving each other little hugs. We bring out the best in each other: she's taught me a lot about professionalism and I hope I've taught her to enjoy it a bit more. </p> <p>We relate to our audience. We're the sort of people that would watch T4 anyway. There's a good chemistry between us, and I think we do a good job. I'd like to work with her on other things, but at the end of the day, even if we're not working together, we're always on the other end of the phone.</p>",
  "Dusk was a couple of hours ago. It's a cold, wet midweek evening, you're on your way home from work and looking forward to spending some quality time with yourself. And unlike a night out, when you're lucky to return with change from \u00a350, it should be fairly cheap. <p>It'll be quiet when you get in: singing, humming or, God forbid, talking to yourself, are not traits to be encouraged, lest you find yourself doing them in important meetings or on the train, so listen to the radio instead. </p> <p>Cooking for yourself, however, is rewarding and therapeutic - have a go at a comforting meal from one of the month's new cookbooks (all around \u00a320 and sumptuously illustrated). Alternatively, if you're not one for measuring out your life in tablespoons, dig out something from the freezer (pizza, \u00a32.99). </p> <p>Spending time keeping body and soul together is always worthwhile, and you can do both simultaneously with Ayurveda - brush up on the principles with the Ayurvedic Encyclopedia (\u00a330) and splash out \u00a312 on an Ayurvedic body balm, which is about \u00a312 more than a relaxing hot bath costs. Television is not an especially enticing option unless you relish choosing between Anne Robinson, a programme about the M25 and various depressing combinations of soap celebs (TV licence fee, \u00a3104). Renting a video is a marginally better decision, or you could try entertaining yourself. Admittedly, few boardgames cater for the solitary player and card games are similarly limited - solitaire is interesting for, well, about a minute or two. </p> <p>This is perhaps a good time to have another crack at Volume One of Proust's A La Recherche du Temps Perdu - the same goes for Ulysses and Paradise Lost and any of those longer 18th-century novels you haven't persevered with. </p> <p>But every singleton has moments of self-doubt, when aloneness teeters on the threshold of loneliness: embrace these moments, because you may come to miss them.

  "<p>Uuuuh-uuuuuh-UUUUUUHHH...</p> <p>Of all the occasions that I might find myself mentally ticking off the undoubted benefits of being unattached and leading a life of heedless depravity, trying to catch up on my sleep on the Wednesday night drunks' express from Liverpool Street with people practically having sex in the next seat isn't one of them. Yes, I suppose I could ask them to keep their panting down a bit, or - if they are in the mood for rhetorical questions - whether they'd be quite so happy to put their feet up on the seats if their mothers were sitting here, or if they have any idea how many different varieties of bacteria are to be found on the average tongue. Or I could just start a conversation, perhaps breaking the ice by observing in an avuncular fashion that they are obviously very much in love and asking whether they've known each other long, or if they have relatives in Broxbourne. Or I could perhaps sit back, light a pipe and regale them with my own sexual adventures on public transport as a young eligible blade-about-town sporting a beginner's moustache and afghan flares in the days long before I came to my senses and settled for an adoring wife, four children of advanced intellectual ability and an inflexible mortgage the size of Liechtenstein. </p> <p>Uuuuh-uuuuuh-UUUUUUHHH... </p> <p>But I don't. Instead I rub furiously at the steamed-up window, wondering whether this is Cheshunt. I suppose I could ask the young chap in question if he knows where we are, but of course you can't disturb a dog when he's got his head in a bowl of Chum. Needless to say, there's no one else within polite hailing distance. If this were Friday it would be packed with fellow passengers, though admittedly they would be the kind of fellow passengers who would a) not have enough mind left to say with any accuracy whether this was Cheshunt; b) not care whether they ended up sleeping on the railway line; c) not be expected by any third party to remember to turn the dishwasher on before they finally came rolling into bed and attempted to explain in a voice unequal to the task of disguising its pronounced slur how they got vomit in their hair. That's the advantage of being single on the drunks' train. </p> <p>Of course, being single wasn't all fun, even in my day. I remember my mum wondering one morning why I'd arrived home the night before with a squashed slug stuck to the back of my jacket where I'd had to put it down for a beautiful young woman in Saturday eveningwear to lie upon. What was I supposed to do - leave the poor girl alone in the graveyard while I nipped home for a tarpaulin? You could hardly do that to someone you'd only just met. Though, reader, I did not marry her. Not because she was not wholly charmed by my chivalric bent and sense of occasion, but because I already had a perfectly good mother who could provide the full five-star range of ironing skills, sausage egg and chips, shoe cleaning, midday weekend wake-up call and other ancillary services that properly circumscribe the life of a civilised bachelor at ease. Who could ask for more - I mean, in the absence of trained staff? </p> <p>Of course, only infrequently was singlehood about having sex with another person. Most of the time it was about going out to the pub with companions of like mind, hygiene, conversational acumen and low self-esteem. What fun we had deluding ourselves that the way to meet girls was to travel in packs of eight and abuse each other in the name of humour. We were a close-knit group, but not obsessive about attendance. If you couldn't make it to the pub, you got a doctor's note. </p> <p>It was all a long way from the enviable cufflinks-and-champagne bachelor lifestyle of Simon Templar or superspy-womaniser Matt Helm, played by Dean Martin, whose bed upended every morning to slide him gently into a bubbly bathful of naked lovelies. But without a TV series of my own, the required veneer of sophistication continued to elude me until some years later when I moved to London and discovered that the best way to get a girl to sleep with you was to take an interest in art galleries. </p> <p>I rub the window. Ah, coming into Harlow. </p> <p>Uuuuh-uuuuuh-UUUUUUHHH...</p> <p>I wonder if they've just been to the Tate Modern...</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:phil.hogan@observer.co.uk\">phil.hogan@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "It should come as no surprise that our temples to art have taken over from secondhand bookshops and out-of-town superstores as the pick-up joints of choice for smarter singles. Nowadays, museums are falling over themselves to establish their groovy credentials, aiming to attract as broad a range of talent off the walls as on it. However, it's the growing vogue for late-night opening that's proved the real clincher: as darkness falls, the various bacchanalian revels with post-coital odalisques on display, not to mention the liberal amounts of beer and wine available in the obligatorily attached 'ace caffs', are encouraging torrid, if not downright louche behaviour in the primmest of mind improvers. <p>The most promising areas for culture cruising include the V&amp;A's Late View (6.30pm to 9.30pm Wednesdays - string quartet, cold buffet, major lingering around the Three Graces and Michelangelo's David ) and the National Gallery (until 9pm Wednesdays - try dallying by the Rokeby Venus). </p> <p>But high art's answer to Studio 54 has to be Tate Modern, and its Friday/Saturday roistering to 10pm. The Tate's three trump cards are: a preponderance of video installations, hence a sizeable proportion of darkened rooms; a generous scattering of anterooms equipped with chaises, thinly disguised as reading areas; and art that acts as an instant conversational ice-breaker (if you can't think of an opening line in the room featuring Sam Taylor Wood's video of a naked man dancing feverishly in slow-mo, you probably don't deserve a date). </p> <p>The Tate is disappointingly coy about its sexed-up status - a spokesperson harrumphs, 'If anyone was found doing anything indecent or inappropriate, they'd have to leave.' However, she goes on to say that staff routinely have to rearrange the chairs in the 'reading area' facing the platforms on Louise Bourgeois's giant towers as, by the end of each day, they've been lined up to ogle those brave enough to schlep to the top. </p> <p>So, if you want maximum exposure, hurry to Tate Modern - the towers come down on 26 November - and claim a lofty hotseat that's rapidly assumed the iconic status of the Blind Date stool and the Big Brother diary-room swiveller combined. 'Saw you up the Bourgeois' is the chat-up line de nos jours.</p> <p>\u0095 For further information about Tate Modern, call 020 7887 8008</p>",
  "<p>The hot new model came down the catwalk amid the blare of techno music. The world's press jostled for space, terrified they would miss out on the defining picture of the debut. A hundred flashbulbs exploded as the pack, flown in by helicopter, craned for a clear view through a cloud of dry ice. There, at the end of the catwalk, was... a washing machine. </p> <p>Waiting to greet his latest proteg\u00e9 was the machine's creator James Dyson, the man who turned the vacuum cleaner into a culture statement. He would shudder at such a suggestion, arguing that the products his company manufactures are the result of intelligent design, not fashion. </p> <p>Arms flailing like Peter Snow after too much caffeine, Dyson launches into salesman mode. He explains how, apparently, today's washing machines are practically useless when it comes to delivering your whites whiter than white. It's all to do with the wringing action. Only by flexing the fabric can those oh-so-stubborn stains be removed properly. </p> <p>'We think things can be done better,' he says. 'Handwashing produces better results than washing machines which don't have the wonderful manipulating action.' </p> <p>Originally, Dyson toyed with putting a paddle into his prototypes - 'all very Heath Robinson' - in a bid to move the load around. His eventual solution was to create a machine with two drums that spin in opposite directions, helping the fabrics to move around and dirt to shift faster. </p> <p>Dyson's company, based in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, has spent \u00a325 million developing the new machine, which has taken a million man hours to produce. More than 300 staff will be taken on at the company's factory as a result. By the end of next year Dyson estimates it will employ 3,000. </p> <p>Everything seems to be going swimmingly as Dyson, Pied Piper-like, leads the press on a tour of the company's research and development building. Currently, 16 per cent of turnover is spent on R&amp;D - reflected in the numerous prototypes it played with before launching the catchily titled Contrarotator. But then someone has the temerity to ask how much the new device will cost. '\u00a31,000,' comes the unabashed answer. Pens hover while everyone does mental arithmetic. 'That's three times the price of a normal washing machine,' someone says. 'Most machines are around \u00a3500,' Dyson retorts, 'but we believe that people will pay for ours.' He claims that the new device will mean weekly wash cycles will be practically halved. </p> <p>The company is banking on the Dyson magic working a second time. Five years ago he revolutionised the vacuum cleaner market when he launched his 'dual cyclone' bagless machine, the fruit of 15 years' labour. Dyson, a design graduate from the Royal College of Arts, had looked at more than 5,000 prototypes before launching the model that now corners more than half of the UK market. </p> <p>He and a handful of employees developed their first cleaner in the back garden of his house near Bath. He had moved to the West Country from his East Anglian birthplace to develop a new type of amphibious craft. And by this stage he had also devised the Ballbarrow wheelbarrow - which he subsequently sold on to another firm. </p> <p>Having developed the cleaner, Dyson toured all the big vacuum manufacturers looking to cut a deal, but to no avail. The City, too, ignored his pleas for cash. Eventually, Dyson borrowed more than \u00a31m and struck out alone. The suits must be kicking themselves now. The company, which has a turnover of about \u00a3420m, will make 1.3m Dyson vacuum cleaners this year - a 10 per cent increase on the previous 12 months. </p> <p>So successful did the product - originally sold only in Comet and Currys stores and by mail order - become that it attracted the attention of Hoover, which copied parts of the Dyson design. Last month a judge ruled that Hoover could not sell or manufacture its Triple Vortex cleaners in the UK. Dyson's claims for millions in damages will be assessed in the future. </p> <p>The court case served as a reminder that Dyson is something of an outsider who likes to question business's status quo. The washing machine is no exception. 'I don't think other manufacturers are trying to develop better products. They're just following the market,' he says. </p> <p>But does Dyson get tired of being labelled a maverick inventor, the classic British eccentric beavering away in the wood shed? 'It's a bit of a misnomer. There are lots of engineers who work here and invent things,' Dyson says in the disarming way which has turned him into one of the UK's favourite surrogate uncles and has earned him numerous invitations to sit on prestigious design and arts boards up and down the land. </p> <p>He believes a new generation of inventors might find the going easier. 'There's more money for new ventures in the form of internet start-ups. Maybe now the gloss has gone off the sector it will come back to technology.' </p> <p>Dyson is scathing about the dotcom world and hates the way his sector is seen as its ugly sister. 'I think we can be creative in manufacturing. It's just a pity we don't have a minister. We have a minister for e-commerce. Manufacturing is far more important than the internet.' </p> <p>The Government gets another ticking off for taking the design and technology GCSE off the compulsory studies list. 'I'm afraid that girls might give up on it as they have done in Wales where it was made non-compulsory four years ago. There could be a real gender imbalance. Design and technology is the fourth most popular GCSE and has the lowest truancy levels.' </p> <p>Other products, including a robot vacuum cleaner, will inevitably receive the Dyson treatment in the not too distant future. The bad news for those who loathe vacuuming is that the robot is taking longer to develop than hoped: the company has found it difficult to attract software and technology engineers to look beyond London. </p> <p>Those staff who do join seem to be happy with their decision. One of Dyson's staff, who has been with him right from the start, says: 'I don't think I could work anywhere else now.' Another employee who joined recently, says: 'Everyone wears casual clothes, there's no hierarchy, it's all open-plan offices.' </p> <p>Such a laid-back atmosphere might be difficult to achieve if Dyson were responsible to shareholders. Would he look to float? 'I'm not hostile to it,' he says, but then points out that the City might take a different view of the way profits are ploughed back into R&amp;D. He rules out licensing the brand and waxes lyrical about the fact that Dyson doesn't spend too much money on advertising. 'We'd rather we sold products through recommendations. It's always been that way.' </p> <p>For one fleeting moment he sounds like a traditionalist. But, deep down, Dyson is of the old school: a manufacturer, and proud of it. </p> <p><strong>Vital signs</strong><br><strong> Subject </strong> James Dyson </p> <p><strong> Age </strong> 53 </p> <p><strong> Job title </strong> Founder and Chairman, Dyson </p> <p><strong> Other directorships </strong> Sits on the Council of the Royal College of Arts and the Design Council.

  "No two men since the explorers Lewis and Clark have set out to shrink America as have George Bush and Al Gore during the final, frantic week of their nail-biting election campaign. <p>Dispatched by Thomas Jefferson, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark set out on their odyssey of 1805 to prove that the uncharted deserts and mountains of the continent were navigable by man. </p> <p>Last week Bush and Gore demonstrated that it can be criss-crossed like a village green, with a furious offensive of stump-speeches, mass-mailing, media carpet-bombing, aircraft pilots, palm pilots and dot.communion with the voters of America. It's a tribute to Air Traffic Control that their campaign jets have not crashed into one another; in fact, the two motorcades carrying Bush and Gore's running mate Joe Lieberman did cross paths, by pure chance, in Missouri. </p> <p>And Bush himself came close to a nasty crash on Thursday, when it emerged that he had successfully hidden a drunken driving conviction, picked up after a session in a bar in Maine during 1976. </p> <p>Bush was still fighting what appeared to be a successful counter-attack yesterday, winning loud cheers for his condemnation of 'gotcha' politics and helped by the fact that the tip-off to Maine's WPXT TV station - which revealed the conviction - came from Tom Connolly, a former Democratic gubernatorial candidate in the state and delegate to the party's convention in August, who concedes he was out to inflict political damage. </p> <p>Rather than try to capitalise on the revelation, Gore himself - campaigning in his home state of Tennessee - was anxious yesterday to keep a safe distance, forcefully denying any involvement in the leak. </p> <p>Bush's conviction, however, took second place to the question of his honesty, as a Dallas Morning News reporter, Wayne Slater, came forward on Friday to say that in an interview two years ago, Bush denied he had ever been arrested after 1968 - when he got in trouble for a drunken college prank. But Slater - whose paper is among the few to enthusiastically endorse Bush - was shy to pursue the point yesterday, saying the Texas governor was shut up by his press aide. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the campaign cavalry charged on. Apart from dodging scandal and gathering air miles, the Bush camp sent 110 million letters and made 62 million phone calls in five days; Gore's only a few less. Every local radio show has been meticulously targeted: hip-hop stations for rants against police racial profiling (Gore); Country 'n' Western frequencies with dire warnings against gun control (Bush). </p> <p>'The man who can right himself by a vote will never resort to a musket,' wrote James Fenimore Cooper in the American Democrat of 1838. That's as may be, but the virulence of last week's advertise-ments knew no precedent as Tuesday's showdown neared. Each candidate has run dry of policies to attack, so the ads counter-attack the other's attack ads. </p> <p>The burgeoning campaign coffers, apparently bottomless even before last week - have somehow found room for more, as further millions pour into both from corporations, millionaires, trade unions and interest groups. </p> <p>Daily, the two men move further apart over the clues and contradictions as to what kind of President each would make. Methodical Gore; intuitive Bush. Gore the combative policy-cannibal; Bush with his peaceful, easy feelin' - 'What, Me Worry?' Bush has been flattering 'the American people' like his father and Ronald Reagan before him, appealing to their Samaritan instincts while arranging to reward their financial greed. Gore, apparently free of his spin-doctors' chains and master of his own speeches, has become a rat-a-tat soap-box orator, palpitating with zeal. In an increasingly gravelly and imploring voice, he harangues 'the American people', urging them to greater things. </p> <p>Bush's standard speech has boiled down to 'Gore trusts Washington; I trust the people' and 'Gore is a liar; I tell the truth'. Gore's is about fighting for the common man and woman against 'special interests' and 'billionaires'. </p> <p>Their policies are likewise at loggerheads. There is no compromise over who is 'waging class warfare' (of which one accused the other all last week). No middle ground over their collision-course tax policies, plans for social security, healthcare and education, pitched against one another like fighting cocks. </p> <p>The fight itself, however, could not be closer: all that is certain is that on Tuesday the United States of America will elect a new President. Unlike all past elections since opinion polls began in the 1940s, neither candidate is stealing even a nose on the final lap. The vote will go to the wire. Although most polls show Bush creaking ahead in percentage terms, they also give each candidate around 200 votes apiece in the electoral college, with some 130 still to fight for. </p> <p>All the rules have been broken: the number of battleground states up for grabs is even this weekend expanding rather than contracting, forcing the candidates to spread themselves rather than hone in on a slither of voters. The final round is further complicated by the Greens' Ralph Nader, whose ego-maniacal refusal to step down has made him Bush's cherished ally, as he steals votes and time from Gore in the 'swing states'. </p> <p>America was invented in the most crucial of those states, Pennsylvania. Jefferson wrote his declaration in a Philadelphia pub; Lincoln rescued the Union at Gettysburg and industrial barons built the modern nation in Pittsburgh. Fitting, then, that both candidates began their week by blowing through the Keystone State. </p> <p>Bush's speeches were geared to give an aura of inevitable victory. He is not selling a package any longer, he just wants to look like a winner because, in the final hour, that is what people want to back. A curious fact about American elections is that in their aftermath, more people say they voted for the new President than actually did. Bush - although performing to audiences of devotees, Boy Scouts and Christian militants - is sticking to a conservative agenda without using conservative buzzwords. </p> <p>Gore, breezing into Pittsburgh from West Virginia, toured the heartland of the old industrial economy talking about the new one, promising 10 million high-tech jobs in the next decade. Then he nipped to California for some defensive work in the state he must and should win, and to record a Jay Leno talk show. </p> <p>Here we saw the man who wrote his degree thesis on how politicians use television: Gore quipped that voters were like a person with a sick dog, deciding whether to go to the vet or the taxidermist. 'Either way, you get your dog back.' </p> <p>Bush also swung to the West Coast, tearing up the San Andreas fault line faster than any earthquake could, and seeking to rupture California with its biggest on record - a victory for himself. In Oregon, he struck his favourite note: 'Tell them I'm from the West. Okay, it's West Texas. But Texas is a whole lot closer to Oregon than Washington DC.' </p> <p>Riding the general distrust of government, Bush talks about 'Washington' not as a place but a concept, a cabal operating against the interests of 'the people'. Absent from this construct, however, are the size of his spending programme, his own roots in the Northeastern aristocracy and the fact that the wheels driving him to next Tuesday could not have been better oiled than by the Texas-Washington axis. </p> <p>Gore followed the fault line, too, turning one of Bush's favourite lines against him - 'class warfare on behalf of billionaires' - and making voters aware of 'the big choice' facing them, as well he might so far as the rival manifestos are concerned. He joked that he would go to a Hallowe'en party as 'his own man - no mask'. It's his favourite line, but also a bitter one. </p> <p>Gore should by rights win this election - and still could, riding as he does on a magic carpet of unprecedented national well-being. And for a moment during this campaign he held victory in the palms of his hands, but let it slip. That was in Los Angeles, at the Democratic Convention in August, when he was - for once, and as he kept saying - 'his own man'. </p> <p>But Gore's history is one of allowing himself to be moulded and packaged, and after LA he reverted to type. Rather than stick to his newly assertive self-confidence, Gore followed the spinners' instructions and was once again lost between his 'nerd' and his Sopranos acts, neither of which is popular with the voters. Only last week did he again found his authenticity - the premium quality in this election. </p> <p>Next stop, Florida - a contested, glittering prize with Bush this time under pressure, struggling to rally his own faithful. Gore departed the Sunshine State leaving behind his (importantly elderly and Jewish) deputy, Joe Lieberman, returning again to Pennsylvania as Bush made another sweep across the Midwest. </p> <p>'The Shrub' had breezed through Chicago and was in Iowa by the time a drunken driving conviction had been awkwardly (and potentially explosively) revealed, while Gore also hit the Windy City - via New Mexico - in time to find the newsstands splattered with an Esquire cover showing his former boss snapped at crotch level, blue tie pointing towards the organ that kept Ken Starr busy for so long. </p> <p>Over the weekend, the pace will quicken; more Florida, more West Coast, more Midwest, more swing states. Why this frantic, and this close? The answer lies, for the most part, in demographic uncertainties. More than any past election, this one charts the new political map of America, one in which huge swaths of new 'Major Metro' areas are swinging some states for the Democrats, while former bastions of rural liberalism turn to the Republicans. </p> <p>Bush's father won 61 per cent of Florida in 1988, with Gore now showing a narrow lead. New Jersey, once a key 'swing' state, is safely Democratic. Even Ronald Reagan's California should finally settle for Gore. These are states of urban and suburban sprawl - now peaked - where issues like abortion choice and gun control are popular among the 'waitress moms' and their families, important to this election. </p> <p>Meanwhile: Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, West Virginia and others won by Democrat Michael Dukakis in 1988 are either contested or lining up for Bush: they are religious states, independent and bloody-minded, and offended by the Clinton administration. And in between are the places where this election will be won and lost: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Missouri. Until Tuesday, it won't be quite clear who the new demographic map favours. </p> <p>The fact that the Democrats are not poised for any certain victory - White House, Senate or House - is itself a historical anomaly, given the state of the economy and the cultural, generational values set by the Clinton years. </p> <p>As a potential Bush victory, Election 2000 is rather like a reversal of 1976 - a blip won by Jimmy Carter during a period of Republican hegemony, with things put back to rights by the election of Reagan four years later. </p> <p>The seeds of the Democrats' problems at a time they should be riding a roller-coaster were sown during the second Clinton administration: the distractions of scandal and impeachment, but more importantly the inability of that administration to turn its victory of 1996 into an unassailable, popular majority politics consolidating the white working class, urban and rural - a failure on which Bush now rides. </p> <p>The other reasons for the dead heat are the candidates and campaigns themselves. There are two prisms through which to look at Bush: you can either see him as the man who spent more money than any other politician in history, only to squander it along with a 17-point lead - or else the man whom the punditocracy backs to be elected President next Tuesday. Behind Bush's success - first and foremost - there is money, as there always has been. All his ventures in business, from oil drilling to the Texas Rangers baseball team, were underwritten and invariably bailed out by big tycoons who were anxious to lubricate their connections to his father. </p> <p>This created the financial base for his governorship of the oil kingdom of Texas, and eventually the present campaign. It was Republican big money that sought out George Bush for this moment, not the other way round. </p> <p>For that reason, the machine sponsoring Bush forgives him everything, even brazen draft-dodging during the Vietnam War (supposed to be the sacred measurement of a man in conservative circles) and even bare-faced lies about his service record after he jumped a line of 100,000 to join the Texas National Guard instead. These things have thus far not mattered, for the packaged Bush is, more than anything, a personification of interests. The drink-drive revelation, however, comes late and is up to the public, not the party, to judge. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.algore2000.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.algore2000.com</a><br> <a href=\"http:// www.georgebush.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.georgebush.com</a> <br>Official sites for the leading candidates  <a href=\"http://www.nadertrader.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.nadertrader.org</a> Vote-swapping website for Nader <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/Election2000\" target=\"_NEW\">www.gallup.com/Election2000</a> Opinion polls <a href=\"http://www.gwbush.com  www.algore-2000.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.gwbush.com www.algore-2000.org</a> Spoof sites</p>",
  "After eight years, Bill Clinton still divides us. To the millions of Clinton-haters, ranting over the airwaves of talk radio, Slick Willy is corrupt, philandering, mendacious, even murderous. To Clinton-lovers - and there are millions of those, too - the retiring 42nd president is both a morally questionable but politically superendowed figure, a giant among pygmies. Even his biggest fans are forced to qualify their admiration with disclaimers like 'a self-destructive personality of course' or 'a great President, but a rotten human being'. <p>Love him or loathe him, Clinton is fascinating. America, which is about to say goodbye to him, remains mesmerised. His job approval rating hovers in the high sixties, higher than any retiring President in memory. Not since FDR have the Democrats had such a winner. It is widely acknowledged that if he were running for office, he would walk a third term. In the arts, his turbulent presidency has inspired an astonishing micro-culture of books and films, from White House memoirs to films like Wag The Dog, to television soaps like West Wing. He is a figure for the playwrights, a political rogue of Shakespearean dimensions. </p> <p>Part of Clinton's magic is rather old-fashioned. He has a genius for language, and a genius for people. Rhetorically speaking, he is unbeatable, even through the cool medium of television. His speech, for example, at this year's Democratic convention, was vintage Clinton. Friends and foes alike watched in amazement as, once again, he reached out to the American people with a tour de force recitation of his achievements (balanced budgets, crime-busting, the first steps towards world peace in a number of hot-spots and record-breaking prosperity), while also contriving to gloss over the myriad catastrophes of his administration, from his proposed healthcare reform to the disaster of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. </p> <p>And then there are the legends. The healthcare reform address to Congress where the teleprompter failed, and Clinton ad-libbed for 10 minutes without missing a beat, until the text was found. The impromptu speech to black church leaders in Memphis that those who heard it say rivalled Martin Luther King for eloquence. </p> <p>On these occasions, and on many others, too, Clinton's extraordinary gift is memorably to express what people have been vaguely thinking, but also to connect, in the most personal way, with his audience. Many commentators have noted the physical urgency of his public appearances, the hunger for approval in his embrace of the electorate, and his spooky capacity to tune into the voters' consciousness. </p> <p>His appetite for people, and for bringing people together, which you can psychoanalyse for hours (abusive father, broken home etc), and which has led him astray in his personal life, is also quite extraordinary. During the make-or-break primary campaign in New Hampshire in 1992, it was estimated he had shaken hands with no less than a fifth of the state's voters. As an amateur Clinton-watcher, I must have spoken with more than a score of lobbyists (journalists, policy wonks, administrators) who have found themselves in the President's company, experiencing the full force of the 'Clinton effect'. Not one has failed to mention his amazing capacity apparently to focus on their needs, to woo their support, to leave them weak-kneed with an excitement that's almost sexual. </p> <p>Men, who have all the facts at their fingertips, come away astounded by his grasp of arcane detail. Women, who think they know better, find themselves swept off their feet. Those ice-blue eyes search into you, apparently, as if you were the only person in the world, challenging, seductive and hypnotic. Joe Klein, the author of Primary Colors, perhaps the single best book to have been inspired by Clinton, puts it this way: 'He is a genius with his left hand. He might put it on your elbow or up by your biceps, and then he'll flash that famous misty look of his. And he will mean it.' What, exactly, he will mean is another dimension of his appeal. With Clinton, ambiguity is all. </p> <p>America will miss him for this, and for another, even greater, quality - his capacity to use the 'bully pulpit' of the presidency to connect with the bereaved, the dispossessed, and the walking wounded. It is one of the ironies of Clinton's presidency that such a flawed father should be so good at playing the Father of the Nation. </p> <p>One of his finest hours was his response to the Oklahoma City bombing. Despite the partisan frenzy he arouses, Clinton has, to a remarkable degree, been the President for all the people, black and white, rich and poor, immigrant and establishment. American liberals will charge that he betrayed the historic Democrat agenda, that he cynically enacted welfare reform in quest of re-election. There's no escaping the fact, however, that leaving aside his silver tongue, he has materially improved the lives of millions of the least advantaged. </p> <p>In a recent New Yorker assessment, Klein, a journalist who has reflected deeply on Clinton's extraordinary personality, wrote that the President's misfortune, from the point of view of the history books, with which Clinton is reportedly obsessed, was to have been untested by a great crisis like a war. But I wonder if this is right. For much of his first and second term, Clinton was at war - with that 'vast right-wing conspiracy' even sober Republicans such as Dole and Gingrich now concede to have been orchestrated by the President's Republican enemies. Whitewater and Kenneth Starr's investigation, from this perspective, was Clinton's Guadalcanal, a hand-to-hand battle that left the field piled with corpses but the White House flag still flying, just. </p> <p>The attempt by the Clinton-haters to run Bill and Hillary out of town was unprecedented in its sustained ferocity. The remarkable way in which he managed to turn the grinding legalism of the impeachment procedure to his advantage was characteristic of a man for whom getting out of a tight corner is second nature. Agreed, without the dreadful moral lapse of the Lewinsky affair, the Starrs and the Gingriches and the monstrous regiments of Republicans would have had little, or nothing to exploit. In the event, there was a firestorm of media controversy. Many commentators predicted his resignation, his obliteration. And still he survived. He has always been the 'Comeback Kid', the character whom no amount of bruising on the bitter asphalt of political conflict could suppress. Nevertheless, the way in which he survived impeachment and acknowledged his faults may eventually be seen as his finest hour. More than that, he flourished, and presided over the biggest peacetime boom in living memory, a boom that may not have been of his making but which he was smart enough to influence at a number of crucial turning points. </p> <p>Maybe the buoyancy of the markets is a reminder that, in the age of globalisation, a President does not count for much. But that's only half true. Where he does count is, for instance, in his appointments to the Supreme Court, and, more generally, in setting a tone, in articulating a vision, in elevating the national aspiration. Clinton may have been an untrustworthy human being, but, whether it's Gore, the prince charmless, or Bush, the son feckless (the jerk or the moron - as some would have it) who steps into the Oval Office in January, either will be hard pressed to match Clinton's astounding ability to build convincing rhetorical bridges across the dark, ungovernable chasms of contemporary American society.</p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.algore2000.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.algore2000.com</a><br> <a href=\"http:// www.georgebush.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.georgebush.com</a> <br>Official sites for the leading candidates  <a href=\"http://www.nadertrader.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.nadertrader.org</a> Vote-swapping website for Nader <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/Election2000\" target=\"_NEW\">www.gallup.com/Election2000</a> Opinion polls <a href=\"http://www.gwbush.com  www.algore-2000.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.gwbush.com www.algore-2000.org</a> Spoof sites</p>",
  "<p>The historic city of York was last night bracing itself for more chaos after escaping further devastation yesterday by just two inches. </p> <p>The worst flooding in nearly 400 years brought water almost 18 feet higher than normal, peaking just below the defences that surround the city centre. But weather forecasters warned that torrential rain will sweep across England and Wales throughout today in a severe gale that could swell water levels further. </p> <p>Police, soldiers and firefighters - who have already laid 65,000 sandbags around the city centre in recent days - were using the brief respite to reinforce defences. Police Chief Superintendent Gary Barnett said: 'We are on a knife-edge at the moment and it doesn't look like it's going to change for the next two or three days.' </p> <p>An extra 500 troops remain on standby to help out those already at work, many complaining of exhaustion. </p> <p>As the battle to save York was reaching its climax, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott flew in by helicopter and pledged to speed up and increase payments to local authorities to help pay for damage. The Government will now pay the total cost of repairs - rather than just 85 per cent - and it will make sure the local authorities get the money within 15 days. In York alone, more than 3,000 people have been made homeless from the floods so far. </p> <p>After an emergency Cabinet meeting in London, Prescott promised an additional \u00a351 million for improving flood defences over the next four years. More money would be spent on research into climate change, and on examining the link between global warming and the current floods. 'Severe flooding could become more common as a result of global warming,' he predicted. </p> <p>Prescott visited victims of the flooding and told them he had 'great sympathy with houses and businesses which have been affected by the flooding. All we can do is give a warning [about the looming storm] and try to minimise the damage.' </p> <p>Railtrack warned that the new storm would lead to further turmoil to Britain's collapsing rail system, bringing delay to a huge programme of urgent maintenance planned for this weekend. More than 35,000 metres of track were due to be repaired over the two days, with most of the work taking place today. 'We always said it would be dependent on the weather, and with more rain on its way we could face some difficulties,' said a spokesman. </p> <p>More train delays are of little concern to the residents of River Street in York, a row of two-up, two-down terraced cottages. They paid over the odds for the picturesque location of their homes; this weekend they realised just how high a cost. </p> <p>It was early afternoon on Friday when Sharon Newsome looked out of her kitchen window and saw murky brown water lapping underneath her garden gate. Within two hours ice-cold waves had filled her yard knee-deep and were breaching the sandbags around her back and front door. Soon it was above her ankles. </p> <p>Newsome, 33, a college lecturer, said: 'The furniture went upstairs straight away. But then I just stood and watched as it grew darker and damper. Eventually I just thought I can't watch this anymore, and I had to leave.' </p> <p>Returning yesterday, she assessed the situation. 'People have been saying, \"Well at least you're insured\", but it's not the same. Those are my things in there and they can't be replaced.' </p> <p>Insurance may not cover the long-term costs of the floods. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors warned this weekend they could have a severe impact on house prices, creating an epidemic of 'property blight' in flood-prone areas. New rules are being intoduced to make sure that all homebuyers are warned about the risk of flooding, making it far more difficult for people to sell high-risk homes. </p> <p>The institution's Christopher Legrand said: 'It could create a blighting situation. There could be significant difficulties for people who have properties in flood plain areas. It's one of those unfortunate situations that happens occassionally. There is nothing you can do about it.' </p> <p>That would make it difficult for Karen Long. Her house is one of the worst hit in River Street.'We were carrying out the dogs and cats last night when I stepped off the back step and suddenly I was waist deep in water.' </p> <p>A passing dinghy from a houseboat some 200 yards away, on what had once been a distinguishable bank of the River Ouse, came to the rescue of Long, who is three months pregnant, and her partner Gary. </p> <p>'We were doing the house up,' she said, standing on the closest spot of dry land to her house, 20 feet away. 'The floorboards had just been laid and polished.' </p> <p>Even those who escaped by the skin of their teeth have a further day or two of worry. </p> <p>But yesterday under blue skies, York had almost a holiday atmosphere as families turned out to line the city's bridges to capture the dramatic scenes. </p> <p>Police patrols have been stepped up to prevent looting but many of emergency service personnel were taking the chance to catch up on some sleep before another possible night of evacuations.</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk\">Environment Agency</a><br><a href=\"http://www.meto.govt.uk\">Meteorological Office</a></p>",
  "<p>When NewsCorp officials gathered in the Hong Kong convention centre last March to unveil their latest Chinese internet investment, a tall woman handed out a business card that read 'News Corporation/Wendi Deng Murdoch'. </p> <p>Deng is not a NewsCorp employee. Once a junior executive at the company's Star TV in Hong Kong, Deng, 31, quit her post before marrying NewsCorp chairman Rupert Murdoch last year. Since then, she has been portrayed - by Murdoch and the company - as a traditional housewife who attends to decorating, her husband's diet and the like. </p> <p>But Deng is no homebody. Though she doesn't have a formal position with her husband's media empire, she has quickly asserted her influence over NewsCorp's operations and investments in Asia, its most important growth market. </p> <p>Working with her stepson, James Murdoch, 27, Deng has initiated or advocated Chinese internet investments totalling between $35 million and $45m, according to a top NewsCorp executive. With her advice, the company has also formed partnerships with cable companies in the region looking to upgrade their systems for high-speed video and internet access. </p> <p>Murdoch, who is 69, has never hesitated to put family members to work in his businesses. Last month, he named his eldest son, Lachlan, 29, deputy chief operating officer, in a move partly aimed at clarifying that he is his father's heir. James serves as chief executive of Star TV and has carved out Asia and the internet as his province. Even Murdoch's ex-wife, Anna Mann, whom he divorced last year, has an office and assistant at NewsCorp's New York offices, although she no longer has an active role with the company. </p> <p>Now, Deng is rising to a place of prominence in the family business. </p> <p>People within NewsCorp and outsiders involved in the Chinese internet and media industries say she identifies potential investments for her husband's company and acts as his liaison and translator in China. </p> <p>These people say Deng is well suited for this unusual role. The daughter of a factory director in Guangzhou, China, Deng came to the US 12 years ago with the aid of a California couple. The husband in that couple later left his wife for Deng. She mastered English, climbed from a California college to Yale's business school and eventually landed at Star TV in Hong Kong. </p> <p>Having left China in obscurity as a teenager, Deng is now returning in grand style, as the wife and adviser of a global media baron. </p> <p>'Wendi gives NewsCorp a Chinese face in China,' says Joseph Ravitch, co-head of the global media practice at Goldman Sachs Group, which advises NewsCorp on its Asia strategy. 'She represents not just the company but the owner, and that's critical in a country where families are very important.' </p> <p>Murdoch has long been fascinated by the potential of the Chinese market, and his Fox studio was a pioneer in the country. But at times, he has seemed to lack the feel for subtleties his wife is said to have. In 1993, shortly after he acquired control of Star TV, Murdoch made a still-notorious remark that satellite TV would prove 'an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere'. China immediately retaliated by banning private ownership of satellite dishes. Reception by private households of Star TV and its affiliate, Phoenix Satellite Television, remains illegal in China, though many cable operators and residential compounds defy the ban and carry the channels. </p> <p>Murdoch gradually repaired relations with the Chinese. He pulled the BBC from Star TV, making the channel more palatable to the Beijing government. He sold the South China Morning Post to a pro-Beijing businessman. And at his behest, NewsCorp's HarperCollins publishing unit killed a book contract with the last governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten. Today, NewsCorp's officially restricted Phoenix channel is a favourite among urban Chinese households, and the company has greater access to the mainland market than any of its competitors. </p> <p>With the exception of an odd mention in the newspaper gossip pages or a glossy magazine photo spread, Deng has stayed out of the public eye. She accompanies Murdoch on his worldwide jaunts and stayed at his side when he received prostate cancer treatment last summer. </p> <p>Shortly after they were married in June 1999, Murdoch told Vanity Fair magazine that his relationship with his new wife precluded her from working for NewsCorp. Instead Deng was 'busy working on decorating the new apartment' in Manhattan. He said his bride, a graduate of the Yale School of Management, was 'a bit frustrated' by the narrow scope of her activities, adding, 'We'll just have to resolve that somehow'. </p> <p>The resolution has taken Deng far beyond choosing upholstery. She has become a de facto diplomat on behalf of NewsCorp in China, a country where good relations with government officials is critical to success. Over the past year, she has met with politicians from President Jiang Zemin down. In one of her few answers to written questions, Deng said she had met the Chinese president only at large gatherings on 'formal occasions'. Deng also said she hadn't initiated any meetings with 'top level' Chinese government officials. </p> <p>In recent months, Deng has appeared with increasing frequency at the side of her husband and stepson James in NewsCorp business meetings. She sometimes intervenes to smooth over potentially awkward situations. In March, for example, she and the father-and-son Murdoch team met a well-connected Chinese businessman in Shanghai, in the hope of advancing NewsCorp's push into the Chinese TV market. The meeting got off to an uncomfortable start, at least partly because of the language barrier between the Murdoch men and their host, according to a participant. But Deng used her bilingual fluency to put everyone at ease,. </p> <p>Deng has become deeply involved in the company's analysis and negotiation of business transactions in China, according to people who have dealt extensively with NewsCorp. Entrepreneurs trying to interest the company in their ideas often go first to Deng, according to a person close to NewsCorp She has told this person she sometimes receives more than 100 emails a day from Chinese people with business proposals. She sometimes meets entrepreneurs at NewsCorp's offices in Beijing or at one of the city's business- gathering spots, such as the St Regis bar. </p> <p>NewsCorp executives say that among the deals Deng has helped forge is a recent multimillion-dollar company investment in Netease.com, one of the most popular web portals that target the mainland. Earlier this year, she worked with James Murdoch to negotiate NewsCorp's investment of more than $10m in the Chinese-language internet company renren.com, according to Anthony Cheng, founder of the website. Cheng recalls that at one meeting about renren.com, Deng displayed her deep involvement when she grilled him on the difference between the site's marketing strategies in Beijing and Shanghai. She calls him with ideas from time to time on how to improve his company, Cheng adds. 'She's very keyed into all the News Corp and Star TV properties and how to better link them,' he says. </p> <p>Deng initiated News Corp's investment last December in SinoBIT.com, a Beijing website that seeks to link entrepreneurs to investors online, according to Steve Sun, the site's co-founder. She did so by introducing Sun, whom she knew through mutual friends from Yale, to James Murdoch, Sun says. At the same time, people who have done business with Deng say she appears to take great pains not to overstep her unofficial role. Sun notes, for example, that she didn't attend a second meeting between him and James Murdoch, at which the terms of the investment in SinoBIT.com were finalised. 'She gave James the right to make the decision,' Sun says. </p> <p>Deng hasn't neglected the business of minding Murdoch, who has undergone the kind of change in appearance often associated with a man's marrying a much younger wife. </p> <p>Murdoch for decades preferred establishment addresses such as New York's Upper East Side and Bel Air in Los Angeles. But after remarrying, he and Deng set up home in Manhattan's trendy SoHo district, a few blocks from the apartment of Murdoch's son, Lachlan. Known for his British-style double-breasted business suits, the older Murdoch started sporting black turtlenecks. NewsCorp executives say that sometimes he even forgoes a tie at the office, once unthinkable. He told Vanity Fair he is pumping iron with a personal trainer at 6am and downing a morning concoction of fruit and soy protein. </p> <p>When Deng began appearing at Murdoch's side about two years ago, NewsCorp executives wondered where she had come from and how she got there. They knew nothing about her other than that she joined Star TV as an intern in 1996, shortly after obtaining an MBA from Yale. Deng herself hasn't commented in the press about her background. </p> <p>Born Deng Wen Di, in the eastern Chinese city of Xuzhou, her parents later moved to the southern city of Guangzhou. Deng was the family name. She later compressed her Chinese first name into 'Wendi'. Deng's father served as director of a machinery factory in Guangzhou. The family lived in a three-bedroom apartment, unusually large by Chinese standards. Wendi Deng has two sisters and one brother. A good student and champion volleyball player, Deng had enrolled in Guangzhou Medical College by the age of 16. </p> <p>Her ticket out of China came in 1987, when she met a Los Angeles couple, Jake and Joyce Cherry. Cherry, then 50, was working in Guangzhou, helping the Chinese to build a factory to make freezers for food-processing plants. The Cherrys' interpreter told them of a young woman who was looking for help with her English. Joyce Cherry, then 42, says she began tutoring the teenager. In the fall of 1987, Joyce Cherry returned to Los Angeles to enrol her two children in elementary school. Cherry stayed in China to finish the factory project. </p> <p>Soon after Joyce Cherry was resettled in Los Angeles, she says, her husband called to say that Deng wanted to come to the US to study. He asked Joyce Cherry to help complete the paperwork and get an application ready for a local college. The Cherrys sponsored Deng's bid for a student visa and agreed to put her up until she had established herself. The 19-year-old arrived at the Cherry home in February of 1988. She shared a bedroom and bunk beds with her hosts' five-year-old daughter. </p> <p>All was not well, however, between the elder Cherrys. Cherry, who arrived home shortly after Deng came to California, had grown physically ill in China from a combination of overwork and poor diet. The spouses' separation had strained the marriage, the Cherrys concur. At the same time, Joyce says she had grown increasingly suspicious about Deng's relationship with her husband. She recalls discovering photographs her husband had taken of Deng in coquettish poses in his hotel room in Guangzhou. Cherry confirms he became infatuated with the young woman. Once they were in Los Angeles, he says, Deng started making recommendations about his diet and wardrobe. </p> <p>When her husband and Deng didn't return home some evenings, Joyce says she concluded they were having an affair. She told Deng to leave, and Cherry left soon afterwards. He moved into a nearby apartment with Deng, who had enrolled at California State University at Northridge, a commuter college in the San Fernando Valley. </p> <p>The Cherrys divorced, and Cherry married Deng in February 1990. But that union didn't last. Cherry says that about four months after the wedding, he told Deng to leave because she had started spending time with a man named David Wolf. Cherry was 53 at the time. Wolf was in his mid-twenties, only a few years older than Deng. Wolf, who declined interview requests, worked in the early Nineties for an import-export company. He spoke some Chinese and was interested in a career in China, according to someone who knew him. </p> <p>Cherry says he and Deng were briefly reconciled at one point, but they split up for good when it became clear she was continuing to see Wolf. 'She told me I was a father concept to her, and it would never be anything else,' Cherry recalls. 'I loved that girl.' </p> <p>Divorce records filed with the Los Angeles County Superior Court show that the Cherry-Deng marriage lasted two years and seven months. That was seven months longer than what was required for Deng to obtain a green card, allowing her permanently to live and work in the US as a resident alien. Cherry says he and Deng actually lived together for 'four to five months, at the most'. They haven't spoken since 1996, he adds. </p> <p>During the early Nineties when she was married to Cherry, and for a time after that, Deng on some occasions introduced the tall, well-dressed Wolf as her husband, according to people who knew Deng. Ken Chapman, a California State economics professor, recalls that the last time he saw his former student, in 1995, she handed him Wolf's business card and said she could be reached through her 'husband'. At 5'10\" herself, Deng and Wolf made a striking couple, according to people who knew them. They shared several addresses during the Nineties and told friends that they had met in China, when Wolf had been there on business. </p> <p>For a time in the early Nineties, the couple worked at a suburban Los Angeles gymnastics academy operated by Li Ning, a Chinese three-times Olympics gold medallist. Deng served as a liaison between the gym's Chinese coaching staff and parents of the school-age clientele; Wolf, as the gym's general manager. Today, Wolf works as a director in the Beijing office of Burson-Marsteller, a large PR firm. </p> <p>In 1996, Deng graduated from Yale and began looking for a job. Through a friend, she met Bruce Churchill, who then oversaw finance and corporate development at NewsCorp's Fox TV unit in Los Angeles. She lacked experience in the entertainment industry, but had an Ivy League business degree and was fluent in English and Mandarin, attributes of particular value to News Corp's struggling Asian satellite service, Star TV. Churchill, who was on his way to Star TV as deputy chief executive, offered Deng an internship in Hong Kong. That grew into a full-time job. </p> <p>Even though Deng was a relatively junior employee, she took an active role in planning Star TV's activities in Hong Kong and China, according to former NewsCorp colleagues. She helped build distribution in China for its Channel V music channel, for example, and explored interactive TV opportunities for the company's News Digital Systems arm. </p> <p>Rupert Murdoch frequently talks to NewsCorp's business development executives around the globe, so it isn't surprising that one day he would cross paths with Deng. In early 1998, she first appeared at his side, acting as his interpreter in Shanghai and Beijing. </p> <p>By that summer, the Star TV staff was buzzing about romance between the pair. After dinner meetings in Hong Kong, they were observed holding hands. In May, Murdoch had separated from his wife of 31 years, Anna. The split surprised even his closest aides, who say they hadn't seen any sign of a rupture. </p> <p>Murdoch told senior Star TV executives in the autumn of 1998 that his relationship with Deng was 'serious'. Star TV's then-chairman, Gareth Chang, told Murdoch at the time that it was a bad idea for Deng to remain on staff, given her personal relationship with the parent company's chairman. That wouldn't be a problem, Murdoch replied, because Deng would be resigning and moving with him to New York. </p> <p>Today, Rupert and Wendi Murdoch spend time not only in SoHo, but also at their home in Bel Air and on a ranch near Carmel, California. Murdoch controls about 30 per cent of NewsCorp, a stake worth roughly $8.7 billion. He has said the stock is owned by trusts that name his three children as beneficiaries. </p> <p>Rupert and Anna Murdoch's divorce became final in June 1999. Negotiations over a divorce settlement dragged on for nearly 12 months, as Anna Murdoch's lawyers tried to determine the extent of NewsCorp's global assets. Financial terms of the settlement weren't made public, but the Murdochs have said they agreed on one crucial point: that their children eventually would gain control of the company. Five months later Anna Murdoch married widower William Mann, chairman of Henry Mann Securities in New York. Rupert Murdoch and Wendi Deng were married on June 25, 1999, 17 days after his divorce became final.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Stressed Out</strong> C4 <br><strong>Black Bear Rescue </strong>BBC1 <br><strong>Little Bird </strong>ITV <br><strong>Equinox: The Science of Stress </strong>C4 <br><strong>Fat Friends </strong>ITV <br><strong>Ruby </strong>BBC2 <br><strong>Josie's Journey </strong>BBC1 <br><strong>The Weakest Link: Champions League </strong> BBC1 </p> <p>Obviously, schedules can't be expected to take into account fearsome acts of God, but in a stressful week there seemed to be a great deal of extra stress-inducing TV. On Sunday night, for example, as the nation tied Toto to a door handle and dug out that pair of ruby slippers last worn in autumn 1987, Channel 4 devoted an hour-and-a-half to the horrors of working at Leeds City Council's One Stop Shop, where 14 per cent of the workforce were diagnosed as suffering from something close to clinical depression.</p> <p>Like a latter-day Kingdom of Oz, the modern front office was awash with chirpy mission statements while the backroom resembled a set from Terry Gilliam's Brazil: wonky filing-cabinets in battleship grey and lighting that allowed even the perkiest of personnel to assume the pallor of the recently deceased. But, happily, after administering a Poppins-ish dose of flip-charts, questionnaires and sugar-coated homilies, a pair of stress-management gurus managed to drag most of the workforce back from the metaphorical window ledge.</p> <p>Even though, leaves on the line and gridlocked motorways notwithstanding, watching <strong>Stressed Out </strong>probably ensured high levels of miserablist absenteeism the following morning.</p> <p>No, on a Sunday night we don't want too much Cortisol pumping around our systems, so it was probably less disturbing to switch to BBC1's <strong>Black Bear Rescue</strong>, where Amanda Burton was to be found playing with orphaned black bear cubs in Idaho. A celebrity getting up close and personal with telegenic beasties is, I suspect, the dumbed-down future of wildlife documentaries, if only because the old-fashioned, hardcore teeth-and-claws stuff is becoming far too depressing.</p> <p>Earlier on Sunday, for example, in BBC2's Wild strand, we had seen hungry, tranquillised polar bears being airlifted away from their globally warmed (and therefore swiftly melting) Canadian ice-floes, followed by Rajasthani tigers dodging poachers keen to sell their aphrodisiacal penises to the Japanese. But why Amanda? Other than, perhaps, to reveal that, contrary to the evidence of every single episode of Silent Witness, she is entirely capable of smiling, preferably while stroking a big (tranquillised) bear and describing it as smelling 'piney, cosy, just like you'd expect a bear to be, really'.</p> <p>Still, Burton's ability to grin like a great big girly failed to be exploited any further in Wednesday's <strong>Little Bird</strong>, in which she was back to her old routine. If there were any Baftas for sitting pensively inside a car in the rain, Burton could expect to be nominated several times over (she even snuck a quick one into Black Bear Rescue), but in Little Bird - a turgid, ponderous, strangely unemotional drama about adoption, in which she played a social worker - Burton gave us quite a few variations on the themes of pensive, ever-so-slightly-angry and possibly-a-little-bit-sad, plus one or two completely-inscrutables, all in profile, in a car, in the rain.</p> <p>Admittedly, it wasn't Amanda's fault that this one-off ITV drama had followed hard on the heels of BBC1's riveting adoption documentary series, Love Is Not Enough, but it was unfortunate that her character, Rachel, parroted the line again. Perhaps 'Love is not enough...' is the mission statement Blu-Tacked to the walls of adoption agencies?</p> <p>In Monday's <strong>Equinox: The Science of Stress</strong>, the second of C4's 'Stop, Go Home' series, we learned that Cortisol was a very useful hormone in the days when we needed to escape from lions, but somewhat less so if you're stuck in front of a call centre's crashing computer screen. Today we live in 'a stress culture' in which 'technology is pushing us forward faster than we can adapt', which will have come as a surprise to, well, almost nobody. The only thing to do, apparently, is to 'craft a lifestyle to optimise our happiness'.</p> <p>Using actors playing a high-powered lawyer and his wife, a working mother, tips for 'optimising happiness' included chucking your mobile phone into the nearest swollen river, not accessing e-mails on planes, ignoring your boss's wholly unreasonable request to turn up for a meeting when you've just got off a long-haul flight on your wedding anniversary, and enjoying your downtime by reading a John Grisham, rather than Brad Thrust Jr's Ten Steps to Managerial Mightiness.</p> <p>Presumably, for those of us whose lives do not closely resemble a 1980s advertisement for British Airways Club Class, some homespun mission statements Blu-Tacked to the workstation may suffice: 'Work Is Not Enough', perhaps, or 'Pass The Prozac'.</p> <p>Incidentally, the latter got a brand name-check in last week's otherwise excellent <strong>Fat Friends</strong>, when one character offered another 'a Prozac, if it'll help...' Please don't try this at home, children: treating stress with 'a Prozac' would be only slightly less helpful than a shot of Paracetamol or a weekend seminar by Brad Thrust.</p> <p>Reassuring, though, to know that the show's writer, Kay Mellor, hasn't succumbed to medicated depression, which is more than can be said for most of Ruby Wax's Tuesday night dinner guests on <strong>Ruby</strong> - Roseanne, Lynda La Plante and David Baddiel, who dished up delicious dinner-party topics such as the pros and cons of anal sex and the fact that being bonkersly successful and having loads of money just doesn't make you very happy at all, really. Given the high whinge-quotient, this was still hugely entertaining, but perhaps a spoonful of medicine would help all that unpalatable sugary celebrity go down - a day optimising some latent happiness by working at Leeds City Council's One Stop Shop, for example. </p> <p>But even if you spent most of last week in a dinghy, rowing down the high street (and, incidentally, what was Steve Redgrave doing when the emergency services needed him? Announcing his retirement, that's what), moaning was not an option between the hours of 10.30 and 11.30 on Wednesday night, during <strong>Josie's Journey</strong>, in which the survivor of the brutal attack that killed her mother, Lin, and sister, Megan, revealed herself to be a refreshingly unsaintly, engagingly stroppy 13-year-old with a smile even bigger than Amanda Burton's. </p> <p>At times this was an unbearably poignant documentary, notably when Josie's father Shaun broke down at Lin and Megan's simple grave, but at others it left a slightly bitter taste. Despite a mutually beneficial 'relationship' with both the Sun and the Daily Mail (they get the Josie exclusives, the Russells get cash for her trust fund) and the savvy acknowledgement that 'a drip-drip-drip of little stories is enough to keep the media at bay...', it was also made clear by Shaun that '[Josie] is at the point of wanting to move away from further media offers' (she swiftly rejected an invitation to open a f\u00eate with a straightforward, non-negotiable and Kevin The Teenager-ish 'boring!').</p> <p> At the end of the programme, however, there was a plug for the accompanying BBC book, written by Shaun, and so one gets the feeling that, like the parents of Sarah Payne, Josie's father uses a sympathetic media, when it suits, as a balm for his indescribable loss. Josie herself had the last word, dismissing her bravery with a shrug and suggesting that, in the future, 'I'll just ask the press people to go away and leave me alone.' Nice try, Josie - but they will never leave you alone.</p> <p>Wrong channel, right time: on Thursday night, while solicitor-turned-postwoman Kate Heusser was becoming only the second contestant - and the first woman - to win \u00a3500,000 on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, I was over on BBC1, gripped while watching mild-mannered Margaret rack up a massive \u00a37,600 in last week's second edition of <strong>The Weakest Link: Champion's League</strong>. 'I've never seen a cheque like that in my life, ever...' she said, blinking like one of Wonderland's dormice. And while she could easily have gone the distance on WWTBAM , I'm not sure she would have looked any more delighted with the result. </p> <p>Incidentally, I was 'Whassuped?' three times last week (by middle-class, middle-youth, white English people. And the next one who tries it will, indeed, find out 'whassup'), but received only one 'You are the weakest link. Goodbye!' - though I fear it's still early days.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Light</strong> Almeida London N1 </p> <p><strong> A Doll's House</strong> Ambassadors London WC2 </p> <p><strong> Road to Heaven</strong> Lyric, Hammersmith London W6 </p> <p> What makes Complicite the most stimulating theatre company in Britain today? It's not simply that they animate parts of the stage - and of the actors there - that most companies don't reach. Their fluid, anti-naturalistic style lets them chart territory which is usually dramatic desert. They're at home with the abstract, the speculative, the wild and the weird. </p> <p>All this was true of the illuminating Mnemonic, which next year arrives at the National, from where movement theatre has been culpably absent. And it's true of the rich, brooding <strong> Light</strong>, though at the moment (Complicite's productions are always evolving) this contains indigestible lumps. </p> <p>Complicite's artistic director, Simon McBurney and Matthew Broughton, have adapted Light from a novel by the Swedish writer Torgny Lindgren, one of whose books was filmed as Elvira Madigan. </p> <p>Lindgren's fable was prompted by a mixture of the bygone and the contemporary; by a village that rose from the ravages of plague, by the deaths of friends from Aids, and by medieval trials of animals. </p> <p>In Complicite's production, a grinning chat-show host introduces a group of villagers who, reduced to a handful by rabbit-borne disease, slide into anarchy. The white-suited compere gloatingly circles characters in dung-coloured costumes: one is toothless; one buggers his cow; one escapes terror by going into a trance. He circles them until they eject him. This is, among other things, a piece about the importance of telling your own story. </p> <p>There's a huge amount going on. Those animal trials, for instance. In true Complicite style, a major contributor to the action is a giant boar - magnificently played by Joseph Alessi as a steaming beast, who dominates the front of the stage, as he strains at his leash and rears up waving his trotters, long animal bones strapped to the actor's mud-spattered arms. This is a pig which is solemnly condemned to hang for eating a baby; a pig with a biography, a pig which sometimes looks like a bald, obliging baby, sometimes resembles a BNP thug, and which becomes a dangling lump. </p> <p>This story alone would be enough for most companies. But here it's intertwined with a larger debate about ways of coping with disaster: there are those who thrive on uncertainty and those who long for order; the play, which continually teases with the possibility that nothing it presents is true, opposes happy scavenger and troubled seeker after justice, but doesn't take sides. </p> <p>There are episodes in Light which aren't clear, and others which are plonkingly explained. But its inventive visualisation is a marvel. Twitching rabbits turn into hats in the wink of a magi cian's, or a butcher's, eye. A fighting couple are frozen in silent, perpetual pursuit. Hooded figures tweak eerie but appealing puppets, with the blackened limbs of mummies and the wide faces and huge eyes of ET; in doing so, they act out the narrator's manipulation of the story. </p> <p>As the curtain goes up on Polly Teale's Shared Experience production of <strong> A Doll's House</strong>, Anne-Marie Duff's arm waves through the window of a doll's house. In the closing moments, as she prepares to leave her husband and children, Duff unlatches a massive hook; the walls of her own house swing out - like those of a doll's house - on to a world of snow. </p> <p>The bold expressionism of Teale's direction and Angela Davies's design spells out Ibsen's shadows and snares. The Helmers' house is wanly lit; the walls are cracked; patches are rubbed bare; dead leaves blow across the floor. A sharp angle, against which Nora lolls like a broken marionette, divides the main room from a small chamber, in which trusty friends sit knitting, like tricoteuses beside the guillotine. Nora's fears and regrets assume palpable form: her tormenting debt-collector looms over her, or slumps in a corner; her dead father stalks the stage. </p> <p>This explicitness has one bad result: it causes some actors (the men - though not Pip Donaghy's Dr Rank) to be mouthy and over-emphatic. But it supplies an electrifying sense of danger. And it fuels Anne-Marie Duff's terrific performance, which swoops from giddy eagerness to washed-out determination; in the course of the evening her voice drops from reedy immaturity to adult dismay. </p> <p>For a few glorious days the Young@Hearts chorus from Massachusetts came to London - courtesy of LIFT - and took the audience with them on their <strong> Road to Heaven</strong>. The idea for their show is, like all brilliant ideas, simple. Like most brilliant ideas, it begins by sounding barmy, and ends by seeming essential. </p> <p>A group in their seventies and eighties performs pop songs. Not the songs of their youth - there are no quavering ballads - but the songs of subsequent generations. And not just the Beatles but the Stones; not just Dylan but Led Zeppelin. And the Clash. Not rocking-chair, but rock'n'roll. </p> <p>Picture-book - and show-biz - versions of old age are exploded. Forget roguish twinkles and apple-cheeks; forget 'indomitable' or 'crochety'. Against a design that suggests both hospital and asylum, three cowboys in ponyskin and fluorescent green chaps belt out 'Ghost Riders in the Sky'. 'Diamonds are a girl's best friend' is performed by a drag queen batting barbed-wire eyelashes. With tutu and wobbly wand, a white-haired woman knowingly lisps: 'Nobody loves a fairy when she's 80'; 'We do,' shouted a voice on the first night. </p> <p>Every song takes on a different tinge: why have we assumed they're written for the young? Yelled by Jagger, 'Satisfaction' is a boast; it's rendered here as a considered, ferocious complaint. 'I didn't know what time it was' - usually a melancholy romance - becomes disturbing when delivered, with dry precision by a clever, elderly woman. This extraordinary, funny and stirring show must return. And surely London should be treated to the chorus's 'Louis Lou I', a retelling of the French Revolution through the songs of Sinatra.</p>",
  "<p>Our story begins in Buffalo, in New York State's declining 'rust belt'. Six former steel mill workers, out of shape and out of work, decide to take their lives in hand. They may not have jobs, but they are, after all, still men. And women will always need men. Shouldn't they be making the most of their remaining visible assets? </p> <p>Does the premise sound familiar? Replace the shores of Lake Erie with the foothills of the Pennines, the defunct steel mills of Buffalo with the defunct steel mills of Sheffield, and we have The Full Monty . </p> <p>In Britain we have known for a while how strongly Americans felt about the original film - it took $45 million at the box office. But we didn't realise quite how possessive they had become. </p> <p>Now, just a week after the opening of The Full Monty: the musical, the gritty northern fable is halfway to being appropriated as part of the American Dream. It is already the hottest- selling ticket on Broadway and one day it may even earn the rare accolade of breaking even. The critics have been positive. Ben Brantley in the New York Times called it 'that rare aggressive crowd-pleaser that you don't have to apologise for liking'. To the Daily News it was 'fresh, bouncy and downright delightful'. </p> <p>'There was an awful long line waiting for seats today,' said a proud member of the production team on Friday. </p> <p>But there is one key person in The Full Monty saga who has not been queuing for a ticket: the British screenwriter, Simon Beaufoy. Only a few of Beaufoy's original lines remain in the musical and he no longer regards it as his story. </p> <p>'He feels it is nothing to do with him now and he has no plans to go to see it,' Beaufoy's agent, Rod Hall, told The Observer last week. Beaufoy was not even invited to the first night. </p> <p>The book for the new musical has been almost entirely rewritten by Terrence McNally, the playwright recently embroiled in religious controversy after his play Corpus Christi, about a gay Christ figure, was staged in New York and London. McNally, who also wrote the book for Kiss of the Spiderwoman , has had no contact with Beaufoy and has only seen the film once. </p> <p>So how did America manage to hi-jack this British hit? On the strength of the film, two influential showbusiness executives gave up their day jobs in order to bring a musical treatment of the story to the stage. One of them was Lindsay Law, former president of 20th Century Fox's Searchlight division, the company who released the original Monty. </p> <p>'It was a one-time-only adventure,' he says. 'Although the film was set in Sheffield, it was obvious it translated everywhere. It is the same heart and for that reason it could travel.' </p> <p>At Fox, Law was in charge of around 80 film scripts at any moment. He was keen to focus on one project only and he chose The Full Monty. </p> <p>Now a co-producer of the musical along with Thomas Hall, the former director of San Diego's Old Globe Theater, Law is to visit London this week to 'explore the possibility' of bringing the show to Britain. A tour of America has just been agreed, he says, and there are also plans to take it to Hamburg, Madrid, Mexico City and Sydney. But London, he knows, will be the real problem. </p> <p>'We have an American musical here and it would not be at all easy to change it to a British musical, although we have utilised a British movie. Our biggest concern is Great Britain by virtue of the special affection in its heart for this story.' </p> <p>Despite the fact that the producers have had no contact with the original Monty creative team, they have taken out an advertisement in the show's programme which formally thanks both Beaufoy and Umberto Pasolini, the producer of the film. </p> <p>'Reviews have said how closely it sticks to the movie,' says Law. 'We do have a couple of new women characters - a jazzy accompanist and a female stripper - but the guys are true to the original guys.' </p> <p>Law denies that he has simply Americanised the story to make it commercially acceptable in the States. 'Musical comedy is one of the few art forms that is original to America. We invented it and there are many more practitioners here, so it made sense for me to develop it out here. Then, of course, the team were going to be much more comfortable doing it with an American story rather than wondering all the time what those guys in Sheffield would have said. </p> <p>'Even over here there are plenty who fail constantly by writing boring musicals. A lot of the stuff on Broadway is full of mugging and \"large\" acting. The Full Monty is true to life and as a result has a much more substantial book.' </p> <p>It is a specific writing skill, Law argues, to be able to establish a character in a couple of lines and then lead him into a song. 'Terrence wrote the complete book to the show and then it was obvious some scenes were going to be better as songs.' </p> <p>The show has nearly double the budget of the film, which has made around \u00a3170 million worldwide. But the talent hired to work on the musical did not look, on paper, like a team that would guarantee a hit. Take McNally. More than 2,000 catholics, Hindus and Muslims demonstrated on the streets when his play Corpus Christi came to Manhattan. He did not seem the natural choice to write for a fun, family night out. </p> <p>The composer, David Yazbek, had previously written only for an obscure rock band, and Jack O'Brien, the director, has a chequered track record. His previous show, More to Love, closed after four days in 1998. Even the show's star, Patrick Wilson, arrived fresh from two critical disasters, Fascinating Rhythm and Bright Lights, Big City. </p> <p>The show was initially 'workshopped' quietly with 12 actors and then staged in full in San Diego. For Law, this slow creative process was crucial. 'It was a question of listening to your show to see what you had,' he says. </p> <p>What they had was a show with songs that rhymed 'carving' with 'Lee Marvin' and 'cojones' with 'testosterones'. Our heroes are a divorced father called Jerry and his chunky pal, Dave, who collaborate with four friends in a last-ditch search for cash and self-esteem. The famous dole-queue bopping scene is gone, so too is the moment when the troupe learn to dance by aping the Arsenal defence appeal for offside. Instead the gay love element in the plot has been enhanced and basketball replaces football. As in the film, the story builds to the climatic question, will they ever strip bare? And it is a question that has the audience in a nightly frenzy. 'They scream and yell, and not just at the stripping,' says Law, 'but at the humour. I was nervous about the Wednesday matinee because they were older women, but they were just as raucous.' </p> <p>Some of the mass delirium induced by the show's finale is, it should be pointed out, rather whooped up by the fact that female members of the cast join the audience in the stalls. It is a revelatory theatrical moment, though, and one which underlines exactly why it was decided it might be rather ambiguous to translate the British phrase 'the full monty' into its American equivalent, 'the whole nine yards'. </p> <p>\u0095 'The Full Monty': Eugene O' Neill Theatre, New York (00 1 212 239 6200), booking to 14 Jan.</p>",
  "Fancy a wild weekend pubbing and clubbing in Ireland's capital city? Then welcome to 'Black Lyn'. To get there, why not try flying with the republic's state airline, 'Lift Gates'. And if you get lost in the fair city, you can always ask an officer from the 'Hainin Polic' to show you the way back to your hotel. <p>No, you are not about to enter a parallel Irish universe; this is the new unionist-friendly, tri-lingual, independent Ireland. Ulster Scots - a language similar to Lallans, the native tongue of Scotland's most famous poet, Robert Burns - is set to be recognised as the republic's third official language. </p> <p>Under the Good Friday Agreement, Ulster Scots, spoken mainly by northern unionists, must have parity of esteem with Gaelic. Now David Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party has wrung a major concession from the Irish government - some street signs, cross-border bodies, and even the name of the Irish parliament will be translated into Ulster Scots as well as Gaelic. In Ulster Scots, an oral language spoken by an estimated 100,000 people in Northern Ireland and east Donegal, Dublin is translated as Black Lyn, the state carrier Aer Lingus becomes Lift Gates, and the Irish police or Garda Siochana is Hainin Polic. </p> <p>The man masterminding the drive for Ulster Scots' equality is John Laird, one of Trimble's allies in the House of Lords. Lord Laird of Artigarvan is co-chairman of the Irish cross-border body on languages and is determined to put Ulster Scots on a par with Gaelic. </p> <p>'It is not Lord Laird, David Trimble or anyone else from the Unionist party demanding that there must be parity of esteem. It says it in the agreement and 95 per cent of the people in the Irish Republic voted for it,' said Laird. He praised the Irish Government, which he said was 'opening every door to accommodate our language in the south'. </p> <p>Even Bertie Ahern, the Prime Minister or Taoiseach, will be given a third name now that Ulster Scots has been officially recognised in Dublin. Ahern will be known as the 'Haid Mannyster', while the parliament, Dail Eireann, becomes the Tolsel. </p> <p>'Even though I am a unionist, I have to say the Irish government have created no difficulties for Ulster Scots. In fact, it's quite the reverse; they couldn't be more helpful to us,' Laird said. </p> <p>The Ulster Scots Agency in Belfast was established following the signing of the agreement to promote interest in the language, spoken in the north since the 17th-centuryUlster Plantation. </p> <p>It is also promoting Ulster Scots culture, including the first Burns Night at Buswell's Hotel, facing the Dail/Tolsel, for Irish TDs and senators in the new year. There are even plans to translate the Irish national anthem, 'The Soldier's Song', normally an offensive tune for most unionists, into Ulster Scots. </p> <p>Laird singled out a number of Irish politicians for praise in helping Ulster Scots get an equal footing with Irish, especially Brian Lenihan, the son of the late Deputy Prime Minister or Tanaiste. </p> <p>'During a meeting in the Tolsel/Dail last month, I spoke to Brian Lenihan about the role of Ulster Scots in American history. I told him the man who wrote the American Declaration of Independence, Charles Thompson, was an Ulster Scot who spoke our language. </p> <p>'I informed him that John Dunlop, the compositor who helped print the Declaration, was another Ulster Scot speaker. But he already knew all this.' </p> <p>But there is still only one political party in Northern Ireland's devolved government which bothers to translate its press releases and faxes into the northern language - Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party. </p>",
  "Scores of criminals convicted overseas, including rapists and murderers, are being deported to Britain with virtually no official supervision, fuelling fears that they may reoffend. <p>An Observer investigation has found that up to seven arrive each week and around 100 have come back so far this year. In the past eight weeks alone two convicted murderers, two rapists, three child molesters and three armed robbers have landed at Heathrow after being released on parole abroad. Due to a loophole in the law, they fall outside the British parole and social security system. </p> <p>The ex-cons, mainly from North America, are dumped here because they were born in Britain but failed to take out citizenship in their new countries and so are automatically deported at the end of their jail terms. Many left Britain as children when their parents emigrated and have no memories of their home country. </p> <p>The problem is underlined by the fact that convicted killer David Wood, one of the notorious 'Canadian Krays', is likely to be deported from Canada to Britain by the end of the year. If successful at a December parole hearing, the former leader of a brutal Toronto gang will be put on the first plane to London. His brother, Philip Wood, sentenced for the same murder, came back in September. </p> <p>Together with his brothers, Philip and Colin, David received a life sentence in 1986 for killing Karen Thomson. She was going to testify against Colin, then her boyfriend, but she was knocked unconscious with a rock and left to drown in Lake Ontario. </p> <p>A Canadian crime story became a British problem because the brothers were born in Scotland. As one-by-one they are freed, they will be deported back to a country they last saw as children. David's parole chances are thought to be high. </p> <p>Colin Wood will follow six years later after having his sentence extended due to escaping. Only then will Canada's triumvirate of feared ex-criminals be reunited on British soil. </p> <p>If they were allowed to stay in Canada, the Wood brothers would be subject to stringent parole conditions and assigned a parole officer. But because they served their sentences abroad they - like all the other returning prisoners - get no monitoring in Britain. Deported sex offenders, who would be obliged to be on a national register if convicted in Britain, are under no obligation to tell anyone of their whereabouts. </p> <p>'With sex offenders sometimes we don't know where they are going, where they are living and what they are doing. It is a very worrying situation,' said Theresa Gilson, a case worker with charity Prisoners Abroad. </p> <p>The charity serves as the only safety net for the returning prisoners. It helps them find accommodation, jobs and sign on to the social security system. The charity has a policy that all sexual offenders must put themselves on the national register before helping them. But it admits some refuse. </p> <p>Many of those arriving at Heathrow are completely unprepared. In some cases the first time they knew they were to be deported was when immigration officials took them to the plane. Some arrive still wearing prison clothes and most have to borrow the Tube fare to London. Usually they sleep rough on the streets of the capital. They end up alone and penniless in a city most will never have visited before, which makes the temptation to reoffend strong. </p> <p>'That is our greatest worry. There is a strong incentive to reoffend when you are put in that situation and there is nothing in place to help you or supervise what you are doing,' said Gilson. </p> <p>Many of those returning are more tragic than dangerous. They have been convicted for minor offences and are now banned from ever returning to the countries they grew up in. </p> <p>One such is Stuart Milne, who was born in West Ham but left at the age of 10 months when his parents moved to California. Thirty-four years later he returned to London to sleep on its streets after a drink-driving conviction led to a prison sentence and automatic deportation. He went from working in the computer graphics industry near Silicon Valley to relying on East End soup kitchens. He left a girlfriend and a child behind and is permanently banned from travel to the US. </p> <p>The Home Office admits there is a problem and is looking at ways to plug the legal loophole. One possibility is allowing prisoners who are to be deported to serve the final period of their sentences in a British jail. This would allow them to come under British parole rules. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:paul.harris@observer.co.uk\">paul.harris@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The hapless citizen had only one concern: the state of the weather. Why were we having gales and storms, he wanted to know? Could they possibly be due to the impiety of the nation? </p> <p>The questions were of such pressing concern that the poor amateur meteorologist carefully carved them on a lead tablet - and then deposited it at a Roman oracle 2,400 years ago. </p> <p>The answer, unfortunately, is not recorded. Only the tablet has been recovered. Yet the questions it posed are intriguing - for they suggest that humans have always thought the weather is odd, and that we tend to blame its quirks on our own behaviour. </p> <p>Two millennia ago, bungled sacrifices, strange omens and sin among senators took the rap for floods and downpours. Today we have a different scapegoat: the carbon dioxide that is pouring from our factories and power stations. This is the new weather bogeyman, the climatic culprit responsible for last week's storms that deluged Shrewsbury, York, and Worcester; blocked rail lines and roads; and ruined thousands of houses with rising flood water. </p> <p>'Carbon dioxide emissions are the main drivers of climate change,' announced Environment Secretary Michael Meacher. 'We should greatly speed up our shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy.' But not every scientist is convinced about this neat connection between storm and industry. One increasingly vociferous group has started to argue that many climatologists have failed to take proper account of a key aspect of the problem: the behaviour of our climate in prehistoric times. </p> <p>'If you take a deeper, geological perspective, you have to consider another culprit - the last Ice Age,' said geographer Dr David Evans, of Glasgow University. 'Most current climate studies fail to do this.' </p> <p>The last full Ice Age ended more than 10,000 years ago, though the planet is still visited by lesser periods of cooling - the most recent being the Little Ice Age that began during the late sixteenth century and which did not end until the early years of the twentieth. During the Little Ice Age's most intense periods, Ethiopia was regularly struck by blizzards and crops frequently failed across Europe while Britain was frequently affected by Arctic weather. </p> <p>For example, on New Year's Day 1684, John Evelyn recorded that the Thames was frozen over so thickly 'as to beare not onely streetes of boothes in which they roasted meates and had divers shops of wares quite acrosse as in a towne but coaches, carts and horses passed over'. </p> <p>The Severn Estuary and the Wash also iced over while the resulting agricultural devastation wrecked the Scottish economy, contributing - some say - to the country's decision to agree to the Union of Parliaments in 1707 (though bribery by the perfidious English was also involved). </p> <p>The little ice age was almost certainly caused by a change in the sun's activity, researchers now believe. Solar radiation continuously batters the upper atmosphere and warms it. However, the sun's output fluctuates in a series of cycles, and when several of these cycles coincide, solar radiation can rise or drop dramatically. When that happens, the planet will heat up, or cool down. Importantly, from the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, astronomers recorded very few sunspots, while the Northern Lights were rarely seen - indicating that solar activity was low at this time, and that our climate would have been chilled. </p> <p>'The more closely we look at the Little Ice Age, the earlier it seems to have started and the later it appears to have finished,' added Evans. </p> <p>'In Iceland, glaciers were still around their maximum size in the early years of the twentieth century, and have only been shrinking since then. Those shrinking ice sheets has nothing to do with CO 2 levels and everything to do with the end of the Little Ice Age, I believe.' </p> <p>Scientists have been able to study past climates by analysing samples of ancient, buried ice. From these, they conclude that over the past two million years little Ice Ages have been followed by aftermaths that were rarely marked by calm, gradual rises in global temperatures, but were instead disfigured with jagged fluctuations in weather, just like the ones that are now being experienced. </p> <p>'Ancient climate records suggest one thing about the last century's weather patterns - that they are very similar and that there is therefore little evidence to support the idea that human activities, particularly those involving carbon dioxide production, have been affecting matters very much,' added Evans. </p> <p>'That does not mean they will not do so in future.' </p> <p>The issue is not about global warming, of course. No one doubts that it is occurring. The Arctic is estimated to have warmed by up to 6 C over the past 30 years, while its ice covering has dropped from 10ft to 6ft. Similarly, weather patterns have become more and more extreme, from tornadoes to droughts, and from floods to heatwaves. </p> <p>Nor is there any dispute that carbon dioxide levels have risen. Records show they have increased from 280 parts per million to 360 over the past two centuries. </p> <p>But is this increased carbon dioxide, trapping more and more sunlight, causing the planet to overheat - and if so, is it the cause of global warming? </p> <p>The climate gainsayers think not. 'I simply don't accept that humans are solely responsible for global warming,' said Professor John Lowe, of Royal Holloway College, London. 'On the other hand, by pumping out more and more carbon dioxide, we are definitely modifying an already highly sensitive situation. That cannot be denied.' </p> <p>This view is backed by climate history researchers at Newcastle and Exeter universities who have studied rainfall records for the past 1,000 years by analysing the width of growth rings in cave stalagmites. These reveal a number of sustained periods of wet and stormy conditions have occurred in that period. </p> <p>'Our research suggests that British rainfall is naturally highly variable,' said geographer Dr Andy Baker, of Newcastle University. 'We have shown that nature is able to repeat current events without the help of global warming.' Nevertheless, Baker added a crucial caveat: that further increases in global temperature, 'could exaggerate the natural variations and could create even more severe bouts of flooding'. </p> <p>In other words, most of the so-called climate change that we are witnessing is the result not of rising CO 2 levels but of natural climate variation, most of it associated with the recent end of the Little Ice Age. This does not mean industrial emissions will not have an impact in future, however. </p> <p>In addition, many climatologists disagree that industrial emissions are not having an impact. 'We are now seeing really large variations in the weather,' said Dr Mike Hulme, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at East Anglia University. </p> <p>'There is no way that these fluctuations are being caused only by warming after the Little Ice Age. That is quite insufficient to explain the weather changes we have seen since the 1980s. Only the input of greenhouse gases, and in particular carbon dioxide, can account for the things we have experienced recently.' </p> <p>In addition, the changes that have already been set in motion by global warming - no matter what its cause - promise to be profound. Sea levels have already risen by a foot over the past century, and will rise by a further one to three feet. For countries like Bangladesh that spells disaster. For low-level areas of Britain, it suggests some very uncomfortable times to come. </p> <p>'It will take several hundred years for sea levels to stabilise even if we could stop global warming today,' added Hulme. 'We are going to have to live with the consequences of global warming for centuries.' </p> <p>In fact, both sides agree that reducing carbon dioxide is desirable. It is just that the climate gainsayers do not urge this action with the fervour displayed by other weather experts, or by ecologists who are campaigning not just to save the environment, but to ensure developed countries alter their lifestyles. </p> <p>In other words, most agree that a few percentage cuts in carbon dioxide emissions could do wonders for our weather. </p> <p>Whether they will reduce our impiety is a different matter. </p> <p><strong>Weather myths and sober truths...</strong></p> <p><strong> Noah's Flood</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 Original scapegoat: God. </p> <p>\u0095 Real culprit: Inundation of Black Sea by Mediterranean 8,000 years ago </p> <p> <strong> Viking invasions</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 Original scapegoat: raping and pillaging instincts of Scandinavians. </p> <p>\u0095 Real culprit: exceptional warm period of climate around AD1000 helped Vikings reach Iceland, Greenland and America and settle there. </p> <p> <strong> 1815: The year without a summer</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 Original scapegoat: Day of Judgment. </p> <p>\u0095 Real culprit: Indonesia's Mount Tambora,'which exploded with the force of one billion tonnes of TNT, and coated the planet in inky dust. </p> <p> <strong> Demise of the dinosaurs</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 Original scapegoat: dinosaurs' own stupidity. </p> <p>\u0095 Real culprit: major climatic disaster, probably triggered by the impact of an asteroid.</p>"
