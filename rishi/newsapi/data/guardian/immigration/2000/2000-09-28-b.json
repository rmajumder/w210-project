  "Well, during 40 years in politics, I've been the warm-up man for some really class acts: Jack Jones, Barbara Castle, Neil Kinnock, John Smith, Tony Blair - and even my old mate Dennis Skinner. <p>But in all my days I've never been so proud, so happy, so honoured as to be the warm-up man for the next person coming on this stage - Nelson Mandela.</p> <p>What a week it's been! We had that bridge, sponsored by Unison. I'm not sure after yesterday's \"goings on\" whether it was a \"bridge of sighs\" or a \"bridge over troubled water\".</p> <p>And talking of the bridge, there is an announcement to make. Would the person who at the start of the week stepped in some yellow paint, please report to the standing orders committee? </p> <p>But more importantly, we've had great speeches, frank discussion, robust debate.</p> <p>This party has great ambitions, great desires for our people. But at the end of the day, it's not like opposition. When you're in government, you have to make choices and priorities. </p> <p>That's what Nye Bevan meant when he said \"the language of priorities is the religion of socialism\".</p> <p>And I want to thank all of you for your hard work throughout the year in our policy forums and discussions. </p> <p>We've had the odd disagreement this week. But don't lose sight of the huge range of policies we have determined this week.</p> <p>And wasn't that a great and inspiring speech from Tony on Tuesday - even if he was heckled by baby Leo half way through?</p> <p>Cherie and Tony are so proud of him. They can't wait to take him to his first focus group.</p> <p>And David Blunkett's been listening. David's got the message. Free nursery places for all three-year-olds. That's delivery - just in time for Leo's third birthday.</p> <p>Tony set out his vision and offered us leadership. He said it loud and clear - we have a vision worth fighting for!</p> <p>And, it will take sacrifice, effort: yes, blood; yes, tears; and, well - perhaps I'd better not mention the sweat, Tony.</p> <p>You should worry - he put his arm round me!</p> <p>Anyway, Tony's sent his suit to the cleaners. But I tell you what, at the next election we're going to take that Mr Hague to the cleaners.</p> <p>Conference, it's been 1,200 days since we were elected. And Tony and I have got the bags under our eyes to prove it.</p> <p>But Gordon's got the bags in the bank! (Only joking Gordon.) And he's not been short of advice this week on how to spend it.</p> <p>Leadership. Now, there's a lot of talk in the party about leadership.</p> <p>Yes, leadership is easier when things are going your own way. But the true test of leadership is during the harder times when you have to make difficult decisions. </p> <p>Home and abroad, Tony doesn't shirk them. In Tony Blair we've got a leader who is right up there in the top rank. Respected here, in Europe and on the world stage.</p> <p>And a man who can lead us into a second term. And Tony, no deputy could have a better leader to help him.</p> <p>So whether an election comes in six months or 18 months, we must be ready, now. Ready to put our case. Ready to go to every part of the country. Ready to go to the cities and the towns, and yes - ready to go into the villages and countryside to put Labour's case.</p> <p>Like you, I just can't wait to get stuck into those Tories. Tories? Tories? This opposition? - what a lot of chancers!</p> <p>William Hague - he gives guarantees here, guarantees there - guarantees galore. But would you believe him?</p> <p>I'd sooner take a guarantee from Del Boy than William Hague. Come to think of it. I'd have more chance of getting a remit from Rodney than a genuine guarantee from Mr Hague.</p> <p>Still, happy retirement, Rodney. The platform wishes you well. But I'm sure you will be back. After all, people said Jack Jones and Barbara Castle were going to retire. And that was 20 years ago!</p> <p>One thing's for certain, Hague's' not retiring before the election. He's getting ready. Make no mistake.</p> <p>You know, he's had another one of his weird \"bonding sessions\" for the Tory shadow cabinet. All those old Val Doonican sweaters were out again.</p> <p>During the break they had to watch William \"Bruce Lee\" Hague doing his judo with Sebastian Coe. He's still learning. He's not got a black belt or a brown belt, yet. But he's just qualified for a green belt.</p> <p>Most Tories thought a \"green belt\" was just somewhere to build a supermarket - and make a few bob. Chop and change.</p> <p>The Tories are a joke, but they are a very dangerous joke. Because of what their policies and their promises mean for people.</p> <p>The Tories. They're a party which gave us the \"common sense revolution\". A fresh start to policy, they said. It lasted three months.</p> <p>They gave us a tax guarantee - that is, to cut taxes whatever the state of the economy. That lasted one month.</p> <p>They then launched their mini-manifesto, in the summer - that lasted one week.</p> <p>They were asked time and time again, would they cut the fuel tax?</p> <p>Hague told Jimmy Young : \"I don't think we should chop and change from week to week. It's not my job to ride around on every bandwagon.\"</p> <p>Six days later, there he was, promising a tax cut, shouting, \"any more room on that bandwagon? Got room for a little one?\"</p> <p>So there we have it. \"Fourteen pints\" Billy Fizz, drunk in charge of a bandwagon.</p> <p>We all knowm, you can never trust what the Tories say. I call them the Burger Kings of British politics - every minute another whopper!</p> <p>Cheap and nasty. Not only do their policies change every day, so do their slogans.</p> <p>In the summer they had \"compassionate Conservatism\". I couldn't believe my ears. Hague, Portillo, Widdecombe, Redwood - \"compassionate Conservatives\"?</p> <p>Think about it. It's a contradiction in terms. They only have to say it, because no one believes it in the first place. In my book, \"compassion\" means consideration, caring and concern.</p> <p>Did they show any compassion when they put 3m people on the dole?</p> <p>Did they show compassion when they stopped the free eye-tests for pensioners?</p> <p>Did they show compassion when they destroyed hundreds of mining communities?</p> <p>Did they show compassion when they left people homeless, sleeping rough on the streets?</p> <p>That's not compassionate conservatism. It's callous Conservatism. </p> <p>They haven't changed. They're worse than ever. Their trademark is pandering to fear and prejudice.</p> <p>The way they talk about asylum-seekers - many of them fleeing from the horrors of war and persecution.</p> <p>The way they behaved over section 28. Abolishing section 28 isn't just about tolerance and dignity. It's about children being protected from bullying. </p> <p>It was pandering to bigotry. That's what was so disgraceful about their behaviour.</p> <p>Their latest target is doctors from overseas. I tell you, when they insult doctors and health workers from overseas, it's an insult to all public servants. An affront to all of us who use and value our national health service.</p> <p>My family doctor's Asian. I've been with him for years. I'd like to thank him and all those who helped create and serve our great national health service - from whatever land they came.</p> <p>And who made this attack? Can you believe it - it was a doctor. Dr Liam Fox, the Tory health spokesman. Liam Fox. Now you know what I think about fox-hunting. But in his case, I'd make an exception.</p> <p>So never, ever trust these Tories. Every day we're reminded of it. What about Jeffery Archer? One minute he's courting the press, the next minute he's pressed into court. </p> <p>There he is, charged with telling lies. I thought to myself, why stop there? Why not charge the whole damn lot of them for the lies they have told?</p> <p>So I say to Jack Straw, there's a case for a class action! Politics of organisation and the politics of ideas. Talking about action, you know I've always believed that the politics of organisation is as important as the politics of ideas.</p> <p>We know we can't rely on all the ladies and gentlemen of the press to get across our message. They've got their own agenda. We've got ours. And the job of everyone in this party is to set our agenda, not to feed theirs.</p> <p>People want to hear about real policies. Not the tittle tattle of years ago. So, we've got to take our message directly to the people. Face to face, on the doorstep, in the shopping centre, on the bus. </p> <p>That's the way we've always done it. And that's the way we must do it today.</p> <p>To keep on building that trust with the people, to win the battle of ideas and to win that second term we've all worked so hard for.</p> <p>Membership - conference, in that battle, we need every person we can to join our fight. Our membership is the backbone of our organisation.</p> <p>Too many of us just got out of the habit of recruiting new members. We must ask people to join the fight, to stay with us, to get involved and work with us.</p> <p>Our MPs, party staff, ordinary members are gearing up for the campaign ahead.</p> <p>I'm proud that Labour MPs on the front and back benches are playing a great part. Honing the message and delivering the message.</p> <p>And on our 100th birthday, let's just pause to pay tribute to the thousands of ordinary everyday members of this party, who give so much to this party.</p> <p>This week during conference our organisers have been making 10,000 phone calls. The night of Tony's speech, the phones were red-hot with people wanting to join the party. I want them to be red-hot every day of the week.</p> <p>Only today, I joined up a new member - our newest recruit, Duncan Worthington. Take a bow! And it's his birthday today. He's 24 years old. </p> <p>He's an accountant. So he can help us work out the \u00a324m of Tory cuts in every constituency.</p> <p>Be confident. So I say to party members, be confident. Be proud. Walk tall.</p> <p>Get out there and tell people about what we have done. Tell them what we will do , with their support. Tell them what the Tories would do if they ever came back. And remember to ask people to join the party.</p> <p>Our solidarity is our strength. Operation turnout: every one of you was handed a leaflet like this today.</p> <p>It asks you to commit yourselves to help the party in campaigning. And to recruit a friend to the party.</p> <p>Well, I say to the people watching today - come and join us again. Rejoin the fight. Write to us. Come and join us. Because we've delivered, delivered, delivered.</p> <p>But the issue is turnout, turnout, turnout.</p> <p>Conference, everyone in this hall knows what is at stake. You know what we stand for. You know what we want to achieve. You know what we promised.</p> <p>Remember our pledge card? Here it is.</p> <p>We promised a quarter of a million places on the New Deal. And we are well on the way, with 230,000 young people in jobs to date. Real people in real jobs. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>We promised to cut NHS waiting lists by 100,000. And we have done. But we are doing something much bigger - rebuilding the NHS. It'll mean 20,000 extra nurses, 2,000 new doctors, real staff in real hospitals. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>We promised to reduce class sizes for five-to-seven-year-olds. We are doing that - were already a year ahead of schedule. Standards improving day by day. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>On crime, we promised fast track justice for young offenders; but we have also cut crime since the election. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>We promised a stable economy. But we did much more than that: we achieved something magnificent. Something people said was impossible. A million new jobs in the economy. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>Labour is delivering. So, we've got a simple message to tell. Labour has got the economy on a steady course; which meant taking some difficult decisions. Now we are investing in our public services - hospital, schools, police, transport.</p> <p>And what's the Tory alternative? I'll tell you - \u00a316bn of Tory spending cuts. \u00a324m of cuts in every constituency.</p> <p>So, when you get to Bournemouth next week, Mr Hague, come clean about the cuts. And to help you, today we are publishing a document which shows where these cuts will fall.</p> <p>We're giving copies to every delegate so you can go back to your constituency and prepare to splatter the Tories.</p> <p>So we will ask the \u00a324m question in every constituency in the country.</p> <p>I'll tell you what it means: 30 less doctors and 60 fewer nurses; 60 fewer police officers; a school axed in every single constituency; a hospital closed in every six local authorities; 760 nursery places; and free TV licences scrapped for over 4,000 pensioners.</p> <p>And that only gets you halfway to the \u00a324m cut in every constituency. You've seen this beer mat we produced in the summer. [produces beermat and pledge card]</p> <p>\"Tory froth\" or \"Labour delivery\". That's the choice facing Britain today. We'll go to the election posing that choice.</p> <p>Remember 18 years. The Tories will be at Bournemouth next week. We don't have to guess what they would do in government. We lived with it for 18 years. And we'll never let them forget what the Tories did to our country.</p> <p>Never forget the poll tax, 3m unemployed, the betrayal of our pensioners and the health service.</p> <p>Never forget the mad cow fiasco, the water bans, the privatisation fat cats. Never forget that 22 tax rises, inflation over 10%, mortgage rates of 15%. Negative equity and repossessions. </p> <p>Never forget cash for questions; Black Wednesday; the pit closures - the sheer injustice of those Tory years. </p> <p>Remember Mrs Thatcher in 1979, standing on the steps of No 10, saying: \"Where there is discord, may we bring harmony\"? </p> <p>The real truth is, where there was harmony, she brought discord. Where there was faith, she brought doubt. Where there was hope, she brought despair.</p> <p>We'll never ever forget, and we'll never ever forgive that betrayal.</p> <p>So I say to you all inside this hall, and the wider public beyond it - in our 100th year anniversary, we can be proud of what we've achieved.</p> <p>The 20th century saw many great advances in technology. The computer, the television, a man on the moon. Even the Jaguar motor car.</p> <p>But the greatest achievement of the Labour movement was to help shape the 20th century. To combat poverty, a welfare state. To combat squalor, social housing. To combat idleness, full employment. To combat ignorance, universal education. And at the heart of it all was the national health service - based on the socialist principle of treatment on the basis of need, not the ability to pay.</p> <p>Because we believe every person is of equal worth. We believe that we achieve more by the strength of our common endeavour than we achieve alone. We believe in opportunity for all, in a community where power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not just the few.</p> <p>We civilised the 20th century with our democratic socialist values. Now our party is taking those values into the 21st century. Putting our traditional values in a modern setting. That's our crusade for social justice. Come and join us. </p> <p>So let's stand together, let's campaign together, let's work together. Together, build that better future for all.</p> <p>[After Gabrielle sings her hit Dreams to the conference, Mr Prescott introduces the former South African president Nelson Mandela.]</p> <p>I am about to welcome to conference a man who - with his courage, his strength, his charity, his dignity, his statesmanship and his humanity has won the hearts of the world.</p> <p>You know, we spent 18 years in opposition and we hated it.</p> <p>He spent 27 years in prison and he never for one second gave up faith or hope. </p> <p>Tony spoke of his irreducible core.

  "<p>This clash of world views, which has informed the American debate since colonial times, resounds still in books like McFeely's. The poignant stories he tells, of three men who committed terrible crimes, of their defenders, their victims and of the criminal justice system, are embedded in a twisted past and in very different visions of how a new world is to be made. One of the many strengths of his elegant, humane and subtle book is to show how the claims and counterclaims that are so often made like points in a college debate - a 'pro' parry met by an 'anti' retort - are freighted with the burdens of history and the ironies of modernity.</p> <p>In the United States no burden is heavier than that of race. McFeely became involved with the question of the death penalty not because of any expertise in criminology - he had none - but because he had written a biography of Frederick Douglass and a book about the 67 descendants of a slave who had been brought to the tiny barrier island of Sapelo in 1802, where they still live today. Stephen Bright, the indefatigable and brilliant lead counsel of the Southern Center for Human Rights, wanted to make use of McFeely's expertise in African American history. Specifically, Bright asked him to testify in support of two claims which he was making in a motion for a new trial. Bright's client is - the case is not yet resolved - Carzell Moore, a black man convicted, along with an accomplice, of the rape and murder of a 23-year-old white convenience store clerk. He is awaiting execution. Bright planned to argue, first, that under the terms of the 14th Amendment a black man is not 'equally protected' in a Georgia courtroom which, like all the others in the state, displays the Confederate battle flag. And second, that there is an intimate connection between that flag and the bitter history of lynching which underscores the death sentence of any black man in the United States, particularly in the South.</p> <p>In some abstract sense, the flag might represent a proud tradition of states' rights and benign local tradition, as its defenders in South Carolina have recently claimed. But in fact, as McFeely testified, the Georgia story is unambiguous. On 6 February 1956, its Governor vowed that no Negro child would ever attend school with a white one; three days later, the legislature voted to replace the Confederate horizontal bars that had graced the state flag since 1879 with the 'stars and bars': the blue and white cross of St Andrew on an in-your-face field of bright red. Its Civil War service done, this banner had rallied the Ku Klux Klan as it helped re-establish white power in the South during a half-century reign of terror. When, in 1993, the then Georgia Governor asked the legislature to remove this none to0 subtle exhibition of 'pride in the enslavement of many of our ancestors' he was jeered at, and finally withdrew his proposal after some months of hopeless advocacy.</p> <p>There have been 460 lynchings in Georgia since the late 19th century; 411 were of blacks. And, as Bright went on to argue in court, the surge in judicial executions after lynching declined in the 1930s could plausibly be interpreted as the swift removal of a black man by trial, which before had been effected by mob. The cries of 'burn 'em' heard as a murder suspect is booked today echo the cries of those festive crowds that attended the hangings, immolations and castrations of earlier years.</p> <p>The prosecutor who opposed Bright's motion for retrial responded - correctly, in a narrow sense - that this was all quite irrelevant. These facts had no particularly bearing on Carzell Moore; no one was proposing that he be lynched. (I also think that the three white men - die-hard segregationists all - who testified at Bright's behest that they had celebrated the execution of Moore's accomplice would have 'rejoiced' just as exuberantly at the execution of a white man. The festivities at the notorious serial killer Ted Bundy's execution were replete with tailgate beer parties and baseball caps emblazoned with the hindquarters of a pig, as if today's Floridans had read historians' descriptions of pre-modern carnivalesque inversion.) </p> <p>That said, capital punishment in the United States subsists - inescapably - in a miasma of race. The Honorable John H. Land in 1977 presided over the trial of a black man called William Brooks, whose case McFeely follows. Land is the son of a prominent local dignitary who had seen to the lynching of an adolescent boy 65 years earlier. The barefoot 'little black nigger' in question had, miraculously, escaped a murder conviction in the accidental shooting of a white boy. TZ Cotton - the white press and courts of his day never managed to get his name right - was kidnapped from the same Muscogee County Courthouse where Brooks was tried, taken to the edge of town and, begging for his life, pumped full of bullets. Brewster Land, Judge Land's father, was acquitted; none of those who witnessed the abduction and murder would come forward. Forty-four years later, in 1956, a prominent black physician and civil rights leader in the same Georgia town was murdered in the course of a political confrontation: an all-white grand jury refused to indict the white man who shot him - self-defence. Even if, as is clearly the case, the murder trial of Brooks was not a lynching, the distinction is lost on many. The power of the white establishment to maintain the social order through the death of black men is all too evident.</p> <p>Some murders - and some murderers - seem to disrupt that order more than others. McFeely cites David Baldus's massive 1985 study of almost 2500 cases prosecuted in Georgia in the 1970s, which showed some remarkable, if scarcely surprising, racial disparities. If the victim was white the death sentence was far more likely to be imposed than if the victim was black; if the murderer was black he was far more likely to face the electric chair if his victim was white: 22 per cent of black defendants with white victims faced execution, 1 per cent of black defendants with black victims, 3 per cent of white defendants with black victims. These findings are robust: none of hundreds of possible variables will make race go away as the explanation. (Recently, various procedural improvements have made the race of the victim a less powerful predictor than it once was, though it is still important.) </p> <p>A solid social science research tradition going back to the 1940s supports Baldus's study and makes the same sad but juridically irrelevant point: race matters desperately and yet not at all. In 1987, the Supreme Court held in its McCleskey decision that Baldus's and similar findings, though they might well be true, are irrelevant. The fact that the black killer of a white was considerably more likely to die at the hands of a state - Georgia, in this case - than any other racial configuration of killer and killed did not prove that in the particular case of Warren McCleskey, one of four black men convicted of killing a white police officer during a robbery, the defendant suffered his fate because of his race. In principle, the new Georgia criteria for distinguishing capital murder from other kinds and for deciding who would die were race neutral. True enough. (McCleskey died in the electric chair in September 1991.)</p> <p>Yet race and the death penalty are not to be disentangled so neatly. In the first place there is language. Both our modern authorised - judicially sanctioned - and earlier 'unauthorised' executions, or expressions of popular violence, i.e. lynchings, speak of community norms violated, of retribution against execrable creatures who have by their actions forfeited their claim to humane treatment, of the importance of deterrence and of toughness in maintaining 'our way of life'. This is not the rhetoric of the Enlightenment.</p> <p>Then there are the numbers. Lynchings hit their peak in the 1890s as the terror component of the broad legal, economic and social process through which the Jim Crow regime of unquestioned white supremacy established itself in the South. There were at least 1540 of them, about one every other day for ten years. There were, in fact, more lynchings than there were authorised executions by all jurisdictions in the entire country. By the 1930s the number had declined to 'only' 130 per decade; the number of executions by local - county or city - authorities had also declined precipitously. But the total number of executions declined far less rapidly. Executions by states, in fact, increased tenfold as popular violence declined, although the total number never again reached 1890 levels.</p> <p>With respect to rape, the substitution of the state for the lynch mob is painfully clear. Judicially sanctioned execution for rape was almost non-existent in the late 19th and earlier 20th centuries; it was left to popular violence. But as lynching declined the State took over. The number of executions for rape grew dramatically - and almost exclusively - in the South. By 1940, one out of four executions in the South was for rape. And then race: roughly nine out of ten of the 553 men executed before the Supreme Court struck down capital punishment for rape in 1977 - Georgia was the last state to hold out - were black. </p> <p>Finally, geography. The South did not always occupy as high a place in the league tables of execution as it enjoys today. Back in 1930, California, New York and Ohio were in the top ten; Pennsylvania was number 11. (Texas is number one whenever the reckoning starts.) But in the modern history of capital punishment, i.e. the history of its reinstatement and growth since 1976, no one can touch the Southern record. Of course, the death penalty is a national question, if only because the Federal courts are so intimately involved and because 38 states passed new statutes after the old ones were declared unconstitutional in 1972. (Seven of them have not carried out an execution under the new dispensation.) There is also a Federal death penalty to which over fifty new categories of crime covering, for example, drug trafficking, terrorism and killing a Federal poultry inspector, were added in 1995 in an accretion of capital offences matched only in early 18th-century England. No one, however, has been executed by the Federal Government since 1976; two executions are imminent, both are procedurally deeply problematic, and a moratorium is in place while the Attorney General studies the possibility of racial bias in sentencing. </p> <p>Capital punishment nonetheless is a decidedly regional phenomenon. Between 1976 and 23 August this year the ten states of the former Confederacy carried out 75 per cent of all 660 executions; Texas, Virginia and Florida alone accounted for more than 50 per cent. By contrast, in the NorthEast there have been just three executions in 25 years, about 0.5 per cent of the total. Race alone does not entirely account for this remarkable ecology but it is never very far from the surface. Even if the condemned person is not black, it still plays its part. McFeely quotes the former Attorney General Ramsey Clark's impassioned plea in a Federal court for the life of John Spenkelink, the first person in line for execution under the new laws passed to meet the Supreme Court's objections in the Furman decision: because Spenkelink was white, his death, according to Clark, was intended to atone for the past, to 'inoculate Florida from 150 years of racial discrimination'. The judge issued a stay. But Governor Bob Graham, a former opponent of the death penalty, who, McFeely suggests, balanced his progressive policies on race with toughness on crime, refused clemency. Graham's behaviour was typical of the new South. Bill Clinton's followed the same pattern. In his first term as Governor of Arkansas he was regarded as anti-capital punishment and in more than twenty murder cases declined to set execution dates. He lost the 1980 election and came back in 1982 with the promise that he would not commute any more life-without-parole sentences and set execution dates promptly. He kept his word and never again granted clemency or failed to sign an execution warrant promptly.</p> <p> McFeely believes that the revival of capital punishment can be understood as part of a more general revolt against the 1960s. And nowhere was there more to revolt against than in the South, where the status quo was most dramatically uprooted. It is difficult to remember that less than forty years ago a regime of segregation every bit as intricate, humiliating and insidious as the Nuremberg Laws or apartheid was taken for granted in what is now the execution belt. The demise of Jim Crow was without doubt the biggest upheaval of the decade and the civil rights movement the instrument of its overthrow. But women's liberation and gay rights all contributed, McFeely argues, to the sense many people had that something had gone seriously wrong with the moral order. In this context, the very real rise in crime could be attributed to a collapse of values. And a reborn death penalty - along with the internationally unprecedented explosion in incarceration - was meant to set things right. As far as I know, no one has argued seriously that capital punishment at anything like the levels that could be politically imagined actually prevents crime, but support for the gassing, lethal injection or electrocution of a few hundred assorted criminals has become the indisputable sign of 'being tough on crime': indeed, of being tough more generally, softness being assumed to be bad for the country. The anti-1960s backlash is not limited to the South, but McFeely is right in linking it closely to civil rights. The end of the old regime in the South did not result in a progressive alliance of newly enfranchised blacks with New Deal Democrats but produced instead the most reliable conservative voting bloc in the country. Religious denominations which are the theological heirs to the anti-abolitionists of the 19th century play a central role in this new political formation and in keeping the death penalty in place today. Most Supreme Court decisions regarding capital punishment have arisen from cases in the old South.</p> <p>Conversely, both sociologically and ideologically, the movement against capital punishment is a continuation of the civil rights movement in another register. Test cases are brought largely by lawyers from major civil rights organisations - the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the Southern Poverty Law Center - or those with extensive civil rights litigation experience. Stephen Bright and his colleagues clearly subscribe to Justice Brennan's view that the state 'even as it punishes must treat its members with respect for their intrinsic worth as human beings'. This is the rhetoric of the Montgomery bus boycott, the lunch counter sit-ins, and goes back to Sojourner Truth's 'Ain't I a woman?'</p> <p>Bright speaks of an inalienable humanity in even the most violent of his clients - no child is 'just plain mean' he responded to the prosecuting attorney's characterisation of the young William Brooks. Rehabilitation - 'redemption' in the language of the more religious - is always possible. And on the other side stand those who speak of the right to seek retribution - the adjective 'divine' comes inevitably to mind - in the name of an outraged community. Every criminal put to death is an affirmation of communal self-defence. Frankly, I am not sure how much each individual case matters, although this is how the language of retribution works. I think that what resonates so powerfully with supporters of the death penalty is the very fact that the State is able to execute people in the face of liberal progressive opposition. Seemingly defenceless against the seismic shift in civil rights and other rights besides, some people derive an adamantine solidity - and comfort - in exercising the power of life and death.</p> <p>History, and most particularly the history of race, thus weighs heavily on Americans' most recent embrace of capital punishment. But there is also something new, a procedural revolution, which has deflected the whole debate. And here, too, race plays a critical role. Modernity has crept up on the death penalty and executing someone will never be quite the same again. </p> <p>The procedural revolution has its roots in the late 19th century, when judicial review became far more frequent as individual states and the Federal government came to gain a monopoly on executions at the expense of mob violence and the scarcely more regulated actions of local government. Passion might sway the crowd but the rule of law must at least be seen to govern the State. But it was the Supreme Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia which set modernity in direct confrontation with much of what had been satisfying about punishment by death. The death penalty as it is carried into practice today is like an endangered species brought back from the brink of extinction, a creature from an earlier age making its way in a very different time from when it ruled the earth.</p> <p>The Furman case grew out of the fact that after the Second World War the United States was on track to abandon capital punishment entirely. Executions were increasingly rare; only once after 1950 were there as many as a hundred in one year and by the end of the decade the average was nearer fifty. This meant that, at most, about 1 per cent of all convicted murderers were put to death and, even counting only those who committed so-called capital murder, the percentage rose to at most between 10 and 15. By the middle of the 1960s, the ratio between crime and punishment was even more out of kilter: an average of 36 executions out of about nine thousand murders per year between 1960 and 1964 and then even fewer - seven, then one, then two out of more than ten thousand murders. By the end, less than 0.1 per cent of homicides resulted in an execution. The landmark cases of the 1970s - Furman for effective abolition, Gregg for restoration - have structured the American debate in ways which neither proponents nor opponents anticipated. Neither finds its terms particularly edifying; both are caught up in its contradictions. Advocates decry the procedural niceties which were the price paid for capital punishment's constitutionality. Such elaborate indulgence of criminals displays precisely the sort of 'softness' which capital punishment is supposed to belie. Procedure, dull instrumental rationality with its emphasis on equity and form, undermines the symbolic force of execution as the expression of the outraged community will. And on the other side, opponents who regard the death penalty as a violation of fundamental human rights find themselves arguing instead about jury composition, adequacy of representation and whether gassing, in contrast to lethal injection, constitutes 'cruel and unusual' punishment. Fairness is historically not a big feature of judicial killing, nor is it meant to be - being sure everything is done correctly is not the usual argument of abolitionists. A great displacement thus pervades talk about capital punishment today, one in which the real subject in all its grimness is at one remove.</p> <p>In the new regime the prosecution has to achieve two things before it can send an accused to his or her death. First, it must convince a jury that the defendant is guilty of 'capital' murder: guilty, that is, of murder characterised by statutorily specific aggravating factors - defined in Georgia as 'especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity'. It could be that the murderer lay in wait for the victim; that the victim was a child or an old person or a handicapped person, or an officer of the state. (Various states between them have produced hundreds of these aggravating conditions.) But this first step only makes the defendant eligible for death. To secure a death sentence the prosecutor must then persuade a jury, or a judge, or both, depending on the jurisdiction, that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating ones. No guilty verdict leads automatically to execution; each sentence must be determined individually and according to rules. These standards may, in practice, be impossibly high and, once again, race is part of the reason. As every prosecutor and defence attorney would know, black jurors are far more likely to spare the lives of the accused than their white counterparts. Perhaps, as McFeely hints, they feel in their bones the continuity between lynching and state-authorised execution. Or perhaps, in an unconscious exercise of moral proportionality, they weigh punishment for even a terrible crime - the rape and murder of a young woman in one of the cases McFeely recounts - against emotionally exigent historical standards. In 1944, not far from where McFeely testified, a sheriff well fortified by drink took a black man from his house, beat him to death before a large group of witnesses in the courthouse yard and escaped even being charged with murder. He was acquitted of violating the man's civil rights when the Supreme Court in its notorious Screw decision held that, while he had intended to murder his prisoner, he had not intended to violate his civil rights. As Stephen Bright pointed out to the eight black members of the jury at the 1990 retrial he won for William Brooks, the murderers of Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King and the little girls killed in a Birmingham church, all white men with black victims, were not executed or in some cases even convicted: 'Don't let anyone tell you that there has to be a death penalty.' This would have called to mind any number of comparable stories familiar to these jurors: of the men accused of bombing the homes and churches of the ministers who led the Montgomery bus boycott - a capital crime in Alabama at the time - two were acquitted despite making signed confessions and the rest were simply not charged. Perhaps, too, William Brooks's heart-wrenchingly violent childhood at the hands of his father, and his apparent rehabilitation over 15 years might have had more resonance for a black audience. But whatever the reason, seven of the eight black jurors voted in the initial ballot against the death sentence; all four whites voted for it. The sensibility evident in such results is not lost on those selecting juries.</p> <p>Prosecutors in the United States are allowed to insist on a 'death-qualified' jury - a bizarre adjective meaning one composed of citizens all of whom say that they could, in principle, vote for a death sentence. (Opponents argue that such juries are consequently not representative of a community in which a sizable minority is opposed to capital punishment, but that is still another procedural story.) Prosecutors are not allowed to excuse blacks from a jury simply on grounds of race, however powerful a predictor it might be of sympathy for a defence case. The temptation to do just that - to use illegal racial profiling to get a capital conviction and sentence - seems to be irresistible. Occasionally, jurisdictions are caught in flagrante. In one of the cases that McFeely followed, a researcher working on another matter was looking at jury lists for possible voter registration violations and happened on a memorandum that had been accidentally left in an archive box. This piece of carelessness saved the life of one of Bright's clients. Scribbled handwritten numbers, divided by categories, turned out to be codes for black and white men and women; the numbers indicated their representation in the voter list as a proportion of the population as a whole. The point was to allow only enough African Americans on the jury list to defend against a possible Constitutional challenge. In this case, the plan did not work. The judge threw out Tony Amadeo's murder conviction: 'Y'all are wasting your time,' he told the prosecutor, citing this blatant effort by the jury commissioners to under-represent blacks while avoiding a prima facie violation of relevant case law. </p> <p>Manifestly, this is not an isolated, Georgia eccentricity: among McFeely's cases there are others that came to retrial because prosecutors had deliberately excluded blacks from the trial jury. The only black among the seven executed in California since 1976 had as his lawyer a man who had called his secretary a nigger - 'only joking', he said - and who failed to protest the prosecution's challenge to all prospective black jurors. (This lawyer's lapse may have been due to more than racism. He was often drunk and soon after the trial resigned from the state Bar after being convicted of embezzling client funds.) A black man was sent to his death by an all-white jury in 35 of the 285 death penalty cases tried in Illinois since 1976 which were probed in a remarkable series of articles Steve Mills and Ken Armstrong wrote last year for the Chicago Tribune.*</p> <p>Ensuring equitable racial representation is by no means the only endemic procedural problem. Attorneys for the accused must present to the jury exculpatory or at least mitigating evidence if the standard - or the fiction - of procedurally rational capital punishment is to be maintained. The biggest determinant in all criminal cases is the quality of representation and that, of course, is closely correlated with the income of the accused. Not everyone is entitled to the O.J. Simpson dream team, but even the poor must have a jury that at least considers mitigation against aggravation. And here, too, the system fails. </p> <p>The trial attorneys in some of McFeely's cases were less than effective, but not by comparison with the general run of representation in capital trials. For this difficult, high-stakes assignment states all too often recruit some of the Bar's most inexperienced or incompetent members. The compensation offered is laughable, and only recently did many states agree to pay defence costs at all: there is a $1000 limit in Mississippi; $20 an hour in Alabama up to a maximum of $2000 and even less in some Texas counties. The takers at these prices are a bunch of losers, or worse. One study found that in 1989 attorneys who were later disbarred, suspended or imprisoned had represented 25 per cent of all Kentucky Death Row inmates. And things have not improved much. The Chicago Tribune found that attorneys so incompetent, unethical or criminal as to face disbarment or suspension represented 33 Illinois defendants (12 per cent) who were sentenced to death.</p> <p>As a result of these and other shortcomings judicial killing, an ancient form of retribution, is embroiled in the niceties of the contemporary rule of law, in precisely the kinds of appeals and retrials which constitute the work of the Southern Center for Human Rights. About 40 per cent of the five thousand death sentences meted out between 1976 and the mid-1990s were overturned on appeal. But perhaps the most remarkable consequence of the peculiar legal trajectory by which the US came back to the death penalty is the time which it now takes to execute someone. </p> <p>The job of people like Stephen Bright and other attorneys who oppose the death penalty is not to attack it frontally but to force the system to adhere to its own rules for administering it. The ultimate punishment demands scrupulous attention to detail and cannot be hurried. Even with routine representation - and many on Death Row have no attorney at all to handle their appeal - the process of mandatory appeal takes years. In 1960, it took a little over a year to go from sentence to execution: in Georgia today it takes an average of eight years, and the cases McFeely writes about have been stretched out for more than a decade. (In the 18th century it was a matter of weeks.) Thus another collision between the symbolic power of the death penalty and modernity is born. It may well be satisfying to kill the monster who repeatedly thrust an ice-pick into her victim during a drug-crazed robbery. But 15 years later that monster is no longer what she once was. David Hume had a point: a serious problem of personal continuity arises here and even proponents of the death penalty know it. A former Mississippi warden who supervised four executions in the early 1990s reports that he and his colleagues are often rattled by escorting someone to die whom they have known for a decade or more: 'If you have someone in prison for 15 to 20 years, you have a sense that when you take him into the execution chamber, you're not taking the same guy in there that came into prison.' </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/lrb/articles/0,6109,374577,00.html\">Continued in part 3</a></p>",
  "<b>What has prompted the review? </b> <br> There has been widespread protest by civil rights and refugee aid groups. They say the voucher scheme is blatantly discriminatory, immoral and humiliating. Transport and General Workers' Union leader Bill Morris has campaigned vigorously against the vouchers, which he describes as \"inhuman\" and \"degrading\". <p><b>How much do asylum seekers 'scrounge' from taxpayers? </b><br> They get a maximum of \u00a310 a week in cash, plus vouchers in denominations ranging from 50p to \u00a310, to exchange for food and other necessities. At most, asylum seekers get aid in cash and kind amounting to 70% of the minimum income support offered to UK citizens. </p> <p><b>What does that mean for an individual? </b><br> Oxfam has a case study of a 20-year-old man who fled the Democratic Republic of Congo after being arrested and tortured. He is expected to survive on a weekly allowance of \u00a310 cash and \u00a328 in vouchers. </p> <p><b>How do the vouchers work? </b><br> They can be used only in shops and supermarkets which sign up to the scheme. Leading supermarket chains including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Somerfield have all joined in. </p> <p><b>What do they get out of it? </b><br> The refugees are in effect a captive market, prevented from shopping around. Their contribution to the store's profit is guaranteed, as the government redeems the vouchers at face value. The icing on the cake is that the stores are not allowed to give change. So a refugee who buys, say, \u00a39.50 worth of goods with a \u00a310 voucher, is handing the store an extra 50p profit. Thus the supermarket chains are being subsidised, at the expense of some of the poorest people in the country. </p> <p><b>How does the government justify the vouchers? </b><br> The Home Office claims that because asylum seekers can receive the vouchers even while staying with friends and relatives, many are now accepting such offers of accommodation rather than be housed by the government. In consequence, the number having to be 'dispersed' to emergency housing around the country has declined from 64,000 to 38,000. </p> <p><b>What will be the effect of the new policy review? </b><br> Aid groups like the Refugee Council are hoping the vouchers will be scrapped. However, the government is being carefully noncommittal.

  "Shaun Woodward, the former Conservative MP who defected to Labour, yesterday launched a stinging attack on his old party, declaring that most Tories were \"instinctive racists\" who had stirred hate crimes. <p>Flanked by Neville Lawrence, father of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, at a fringe meeting in Brighton, Mr Woodward accused William Hague of \"disgraceful\" behaviour when he called for all asylum seekers to be locked up. </p> <p>The MP for Witney told the meeting: \"What was disgraceful was when the Conservative party, seeing how good it was at winning short term political support, actually developed political strategies designed to win local election seats and councils based on stirring up these fears because of the way they used their language.\" </p> <p>Mr Woodward added that the Tories' careless language had endangered Britain's ethnic minorities. </p> <p>\"Indirectly it does lead almost immediately to the promotion of hate crimes and actually the sort of appalling, disgraceful things that Stephen [Lawrence] suffered, he said. \"There will have been people... who do not have white skin in Britain who after the local elections this year will have been the victims of beatings, maiming and probably murder because of the sentiment that was stirred up.\" Mr Woodward's remarks will come as a blow to the Tory leadership which recently appointed the former London mayor candidate Steven Norris as a party vice-chairman in charge of wooing ethnic minorities. </p> <p>Mr Norris, who reached out to all communities during the mayoral election contest, has admitted that the Tories need to do more to appeal to such voters. </p> <p>His private thoughts about the racism in the Tory party were voiced by a senior aide during the election contest.

There is a Merlin in his life: a presence both familiar and strange, deeply mistrusted by the village priest, and this Merlin gives young Arthur a black stone in which he sees the story of the legendary Arthur played out for him. The more he sees, the more their stories begin to overlap. This book (the first of a trilogy) is told in 100 very short sections, as bright and vivid as the pictures in a Book of Hours.

Almond's well-received novels have trodden the borders of fantasy: I think he is even better with this firmly-rooted realism.

  "<p><strong>The polar bear king, Iorek Byrnison, has entered another world to seek out his friend Lee Scoresby...</strong></p> <p>And some time later, Iorek Byrnison stepped through the blackened undergrowth and the heat-split rocks at the edge of a burnt forest. The sun was glaring through the smoky haze, but he ignored the heat as he ignored the charcoal dust that blackened his white fur and the midges that searched in vain for skin to bite.<br></p> <p> He had come a long way, and at one point in his journey, he had found himself swimming into that other world. He noticed the change in the taste of the water and the temperature of the air, but the air was still good to breathe, and the water still held his body up, so he swam on, and now he had left the sea behind, and he was nearly at the place Serafina Pekkala had described. He cast around, his black eyes gazing up at the sun-shimmering rocks of a wall of limestone crags above him. <br></p> <p> Between the edge of the burnt forest and the mountains, a rocky slope of heavy boulders and scree was littered with scorched and twisted metal: girders and struts that had belonged to some complex machine. Iorek Byrnison looked at them as a smith as well as a warrior, but there was nothing in these fragments he could use. He scored a line with a mighty claw along a strut less damaged than most, and feeling a flimsiness in the quality of the metal, turned away at once and scanned the mountain wall again.<br></p> <p> Then he saw what he was looking for: a narrow gully leading back between jagged walls, and at the entrance, a large low boulder.<br></p> <p> He clambered steadily towards it. Beneath his huge feet, dry bones snapped loudly in the stillness, because many men had died here, to be picked clean by coyotes and vultures and lesser creatures; but the great bear ignored them and stepped up carefully towards the rock. The going was loose and he was heavy, and more than once the scree shifted under his feet and carried him down again in a scramble of dust and gravel. But as soon as he slid down he began to move up once more, relentlessly, patiently, until he reached the rock itself, where the footing was firmer.<br></p> <p> The boulder was pitted and chipped with bullet-marks. Everything the witch had told him was true. And in confirmation, a little Arctic flower, a purple saxifrage, blossomed improbably where the witch had planted it as a signal in a cranny of the rock.<br></p> <p> Iorek Byrnison moved around to the upper side. It was a good shelter from an enemy below, but not good enough; for among the hail of bullets that had chipped fragments off the rock had been a few that had found their target, and that lay where they had come to rest, in the body of the man lying stiff in the shadow.<br></p> <p> He was a body, still, and not a skeleton, because the witch had laid a spell to preserve him from corruption. Iorek could see the face of his old comrade drawn and tight with the pain of his wounds, and see the jagged holes in his garments where the bullets had entered. The witch's spell did not cover the blood that must have spilled, and insects and the sun and the wind had dispersed it completely. Lee Scoresby looked not asleep, nor at peace; he looked as if he had died in battle; but he looked as if he knew that his fight had been successful. <br></p> <p>And because the Texan aeronaut was one of the very few humans Iorek had ever esteemed, he accepted the man's last gift to him. With deft movements of his claws, he ripped aside the dead man's clothes, opened the body with one slash, and began to feast on the flesh and blood of his old friend. It was his first meal for days, and he was hungry.<br></p> <p> But a complex web of thoughts was weaving itself in the bear king's mind, with more strands in it than hunger and satisfaction. There was the memory of the little girl Lyra, whom he had named Silvertongue, and whom he had last seen crossing the fragile snow-bridge across a crevasse in his own island of Svalbard. Then there was the agitation among the witches, the rumours of pacts and alliances and war; and then there was the surpassingly strange fact of this new world itself, and the witch's insistence that there were many more such worlds, and that the fate of them all hung somehow on the fate of the child. <br></p> <p>And then there was the melting of the ice. He and his people lived on the ice; ice was their home; ice was their citadel. Since the vast disturbances in the Arctic, the ice had begun to disappear, and Iorek knew that he had to find an ice-bound fastness for his kin, or they would perish. Lee had told him that there were mountains in the south so high that even his balloon could not fly over them, and they were crowned with snow and ice all year round. Exploring those mountains was his next task.<br></p> <p> But for now, something simpler possessed his heart, something bright and hard and unshakeable: vengeance. Lee Scoresby, who had rescued Iorek from danger in his balloon and fought beside him in the Arctic of his own world, had died. Iorek would avenge him. The good man's flesh and bone would both nourish him and keep him restless until blood was spilled enough to still his heart. The sun was setting as Iorek finished his meal, and the air was cooling down. After gathering the remaining fragments into a single heap, the bear lifted the flower in his mouth and dropped it in the centre of them, as humans liked to do. The witch's spell was broken now; the rest of Lee's body was free to all who came. Soon it would be nourishing a dozen different kinds of life.<br></p> <p> Then Iorek set off down the slope towards the sea again, towards the south.</p> <p>(c) Philip Pullman 2000.

  "Sit outside one of the hypermarkets that ring Budapest, and you can watch a stream of shoppers rattling their carts through the automatic doors, or stopping for an ice cream as they emerge laden with goodies. It is possible to get almost anything you want in Hungary these days - exotic fruits that were unknown a few years back, cheeses from all over Europe, and a dazzling choice of foreign dishwashers, refrigerators and cookers. If you have enough money, that is. But a lot of people do not. A surgeon friend showed us his pay slip the other day. His high-stress job in a casualty department is worth just over $170 a month, so he works on Saturday nights as a disc jockey to support his wife and two-year-old son. Others are even less fortunate. <p>Budapest is enjoying a construction boom, and the government reported a sharp fall in unemployment last month. But there has been no obvious decline in the number of homeless people roaming the streets, and unemployment is sure to soar again this winter. So the annual lomtalanit\u00e1s (collection of unwanted items), when people turn out their basements and dump the contents at the side of the street for the council to take away, is still a keenly awaited event. The day before the pick-up for their district people get up early to put their stuff on the pavement before going to work. Then there's almost a party atmosphere as neighbours sort through discarded beds, mattresses, wash-basins, toilet bowls and tyres in case there's something they need. </p> <p>The Gypsies and scrap metal dealers are up early too. \"Got the other one, dearie?\" a Romany woman asks a man who is dumping a bedside table outside a block of flats. Another resident grabs a bed almost before its previous owner has put it down, carries it upstairs and re-emerges with a smaller one. The basement of our house in the southwestern district of Kelenf\u00f6ld hasn't been emptied for a decade, and the family descends on us at 7am to weed out the treasures of yesteryear, when you threw nothing remotely serviceable away in case there was a sudden shortage, or someone got married and needed to fix a bathroom or a kitchen in their new home. </p> <p>One by one these dusty trophies emerge: a bent tandem bicycle frame, a chipped sink, a divan with faded green upholstery, a collection of old tyres from the family Trabant, which is still in service, powered by a Volkswagen engine. Under the eagle eye of my mother-in-law, Edit, who uses her veto several times because she can't bear to part with something, we lug the stuff up the stairs and across the grass of the little park to a growing pile of similar objects. The tandem doesn't stay there long. Three scrap dealers lurking at the edge of the pile pounce on it, and one of them takes it to a van. A second attacks the sink with a blunt object, to free the taps and metal piping attached to it. The third inspects a loo contributed by a neighbour. </p> <p>On the whole it is all very polite and good-humoured. One of the scrap men actually asks if it's OK to remove a child's two-wheeler. But across the way an elderly resident bawls out a ponytailed hippie who tries to put a small wooden something or other on a second heap. \"That's my pile,\" shouts the older man, arguing that the object contravenes regulations (the lomtalanit\u00e1s does not include ordinary household refuse or debris from building sites). Ponytail slinks off, to return later with a larger wooden object that he deposits on our pile alongside some sticks contributed by an old woman from a house opposite. </p> <p>Our basement cleaned out, we set off in the car, past 20 or 30 battered fridges neatly stacked on some waste ground. As we drive by, a tiny pick-up truck approaches with two more. People are always looking for a fridge that works: these will be cannibalised, and the better-looking ones sold. When we get home late in the afternoon the heap on our side of the park stretches for 25m along the street and 15m on to the grass. At its highest it rises a good 3m. A few latecomers are nosing gloomily around in case the professionals have left anything worth having. Their task seems pretty hopeless. But these outcasts of the consumer boom have learned to make even a forlorn hope go a long way. </p>",
  "<p>The petrol crisis has prompted a serious rethink among some of Europe's motorists as they rush to escape the ever-present threat of higher prices by buying the latest models powered by fuel efficient, high performance, low emission diesel engines produced by manufacturers such as VW, Peugeot and even BMW. </p> <p>Yesterday, on the eve of the Paris motor show, analysts reported that around a third of new cars bought in Europe this year will be diesel compared with just 15% a decade ago. </p> <p>But the ramping up of crude oil prices and its impact on forecourts allied with regulations to reduce greenhouse gases has prompted both oil companies and car makers to bring forward the unthinkable: vehicles no longer fuelled by petrol or diesel but by alternative energy sources such as hydrogen - an apparently limitless and non-pollutant fuel previously thought of in connection with only nuclear or rocket technology. </p> <p>At an extraordinarily eerie filling station behind the cargo area at the Bavarian capital's airport, you can already fill up a top of the range BMW 7 series with the fuel of the future: liquid hydrogen. A robotic arm, triggered by a series of electronic messages from the dashboard and a smart payment card, glides out and fills the 750HL with up to 140 litres of liquid hydrogen - enough to travel 400km. </p> <p>The fuel is stored, at -253 C, in a tank fitted behind the rear seats that, according to Martin Geier, a BMW research executive, can withstand a full scale, rear end crash. The 5.4 litre engine, producing 204HP, does 0-100km in 9.6 seconds (compared with 6.8 for a conventional 750iL) and has a top speed of 226km an hour (compared with 250). It uses 40 litres per 100km compared with 13.8 for its conventional sister and the three or four litres of petrol now targeted by manufacturers. And in case the hydrogen runs out and the driver is not near the DM34m (\u00a310m) filling station at the airport, it has a 95-litre reserve petrol tank. </p> <p>The only problem is that you cannot yet buy the vehicle. There are only 15 such cars running in Germany. But Burkhard Goeschel, BMW's development director, says the engine has reached the stage where it is virtually ready to go into series production, and forecasts that at least several thousand will have been sold within the next few years. </p> <p>\"Series production, technically, can be started within a couple of months,\" says Mr Geier. </p> <p><strong> Future rivals</strong><br> </p> <p> BMW has opted for liquid hydrogen, now extracted from natural gas by its project partner Linde, rather than the hydrogen fuel cells being developed by rival groups which have forged strategic partnerships: Ford and DaimlerChrysler with Canadian cell producer Ballard and General Motors and Toyota, for instance. </p> <p>\"Everyone is buying a ticket to the lottery because we all know that whoever wins will win big time,\" says Paul Everitt, chief economist at the Society of Motor manufacturers and Traders. \"Nobody really knows what the market will be nor what is the right technology - they know they just have to be in the game.\" </p> <p>BMW says it favours liquid hydrogen because that guarantees higher performance than fuel cells which, so far, can enable a car to run for around 230km rather than the 400km of the 750HL and because it promises nil emissions </p> <p>However, says Mr Everitt, the extraction of hydrogen from water or gas is now achieved at considerable environmental impact - and manufacturers are betting on several tickets, including hybrid vehicles, in advance of a market that is still in the making. </p> <p>\"Nobody says they're going to win, and there's a considerable degree of doubt. They all have their own strategy and if you get it right and hit it first, you'll be the first one into the market and have a very clear competitive advantage,\" he says. </p> <p>So the oil companies such as BP Amoco are backing the car groups' alliances but equally hedging their bets as to the outcome, torn between their awareness that in the medium term oil may no longer fuel the modern economies and short-term issues of cost and competitiveness. </p> <p>Fritz Vahrenholt, a German Shell executive involved in the BMW project, says: \"The first hydrogen filling stations are here now. In 20 years every other new car worldwide should be capable of running on hydrogen. That's our objective.\" </p> <p><strong> Crude rethink</strong><br> </p> <p> The recent fuel crisis underlined the degree to which modern economies depend on oil but also that to which oil is a finite resource. Opec countries already realise that the time for achieving maximum revenues may be relatively short-lived, and Saudi Arabian ministers have said that the emergence of alternative fuels such as hydrogen should stabilise oil prices. </p> <p>BMW's Mr Geier points to an immediate snag: the absence of a national infrastructure to support alternative fuels. </p> <p>\"We could start production when we know our politicians are willing to support this and we have had no clear statements, even from the red-green coalition in Berlin, that hydrogen will be the fuel of the future.\" </p> <p>The more fundamental snag remains the issue at the heart of the stand-off between farmers and hauliers and their governments: tax. BMW executives acknowledge that without fiscal incentives the development of hydrogen-fuelled cars will be delayed or even prevented. </p> <p>So groups such as BMW may be ready to produce hydrogen-fuelled cars in volume but the political process has yet to encourage this. </p> <p>The recent crisis on the roads of Europe may yet prove to be the spur for a radical rethink which, within the next decade or so, will see us queuing up for fuel at filling stations such as the now deserted facility at Munich's airport.</p>",
  "American forces mopped up one of the last pockets of post-Cold War resistance yesterday when they deprived Cuba of the baseball gold medal for the first time. The US won the final after a brilliant performance from their 22-year-old pitcher Ben Sheets, who shut out the Cubans, pitching throughout the nine innings and securing a 4-0 victory. \"At the bottom of the seventh,\" said one US writer, \"Karl Marx got out of his seat and decided to beat the traffic.\" <p>The Cuban manager Servio Borges paid tribute to Sheets and shrugged: \"It's just a game of baseball.\" He may find it harder saying that back home. </p> <p>Cuba had never lost a game since baseball was introduced to the Olympics in 1992 before a surprise defeat against the Dutch last week. However, the rules had turned against them since professionals were at last allowed to compete and, theoretically, the US could send a dream team of all-stars. </p> <p>But the major league clubs had no intention of losing any players they needed at a crucial stage of the season and sent out instead a much-derided group of youngsters, with only a couple of old sweats. Sheets is no more than one of many up-and-comers making his way towards the top of the Milwaukee Brewers farm system. At least, that's all he was . </p> <p>\"This guy's a great pitcher,\" said the US manager, 73-year-old Tommy Lasorda, who has specialised in making Bill Shankly sound inhibited. \"He's got ice water in his veins. He's just a baby as far as baseball is concerned and look at what he's done in front of the whole world.\" </p> <p>Lasorda, who managed the Los Angeles Dodgers in four World Series, had no doubt about the importance of this win. \"This is bigger than the World Series. When the Dodgers won, the Dodger fans were happy but no one else was. But today, with this baseball team, the United States of America gets happy. By today everyone in the world knows about these players.\" </p> <p>You don't have to buy everything he says to catch the drift. And this is certainly yet another poke in the eye across the Florida Keys to Uncle Sam's longest-running irritant - in the sport Fidel Castro loves most. It may be followed by some smaller-scale digs as well. Round the stadium, at every game of baseball, were a group of inscrutable, self-contained men with radar guns and clipboards: US major-league scouts. </p> <p>The Cuban pitcher Maels Rodriguez touched 100mph during the middle innings of last night's game. Only a couple of guys in the US can match that, and it makes his potential value astronomical should he make a mistake and go to the wrong departure gate at Sydney Airport today. </p> <p>It is thought unlikely that any Americans will be lured to a contract in Cuba for a handful of pesos and all the sugar cane they can eat. But the US players may also have their values enhanced. Most of them have been plying their trade in thebackwaters of baseball - the Carolina and the Shenandoah Valley League; in Bangor, Maine, and Cheyenne, Wyoming - waiting for their big chance. Marshalled by Lasorda and the 37-year-old catcher Pat Borders, who won a World Series with Toronto, they made the most of it. </p> <p>Sydney probably seemed like just another plane stop, with funny dollars and accents, to most of them. Australia has rather more of a baseball tradition than Britain: the game used to be played in the winter and young cricketers such as the Chappells treated it as a useful off-season diversion. There were moments when the stadium seemed more like a little offshoot of the US and not part of these Olympics at all. However, the hot dogs were disgusting and would have been declared unconstitutional (as \"cruel and unusual punishment\") by the US Supreme Court. </p> <p>Most of the spectators were locals, which anaesthetised the underlying tensions. Last Saturday, when Cuba won the preliminary game against the US, there was a near-brawl. This was a routine baseball argument rather than a fight over Elian Gonzalez, Guantanamo and the future of the west. None the less, the US players thought the Cubans were keyed up and antagonistic. </p> <p>In the final, though, everything was tranquil. The US underdogs scraped into the final only early yesterday morning, with a late home run in the rain-delayed semi-final against Korea. However, Borges surprisingly started one of his lesser pitchers, Pedro Luis Lazo, against them. Mike Neill of the Seattle Mariners hit Lazo for the only home run of the night in the opening inning, Cuba never regained control, and in the fifth inning the US bats drove in three more runs. Sheets, meanwhile, remained unwavering. </p> <p>It all happened on the day it was announced that Rupert Murdoch's Fox network has bid for the TV rights to the major leagues for the next five years. Here was one part of Rupe's portfolio, baseball, coming together with another, Australia. Perhaps the guys can dwell on that on the journey back to Havana, and be grateful there's still something that can make them glad to be Cubans.</p>",
  "Tony Blair and Gordon Brown last night shrugged off a conference defeat at the hands of the unions by refusing to bend to pressure to restore the historic link between pensions and average earnings. <p>After a day of backroom meetings and attempted deal-making reminiscent of Labour conferences of old, the Brighton gathering rounded off a heated debate by voting 60-40 against the leadership. </p> <p>But any impression that this might help to alter government thinking on the controversial pensions-earnings issue was quickly swept away by the chancellor last night. \"I'm not going to give in to the proposal that came from the union leaders today. We have said quite clearly we are not doing that.\" </p> <p>Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, he went on: \"It is for the country to judge, it is not for a few composite motions to decide the policy of this government and this country. It is for the whole community, and I'm listening to the whole community.\" </p> <p>Twenty-four hours after delegates had cheered Mr Blair lustily they were spurred to defiance by a succession of speakers insisting that Labour must provide \"an immediate and substantial increase in the basic state pension\". </p> <p>Among them was Baroness Barbara Castle, creator of the state earnings-related pension in the 70s, now scornfully hounding her successors in the week of her 90th birthday. </p> <p>\"Comrades, pass this resolution today. This country can afford it because remember one thing, the cost of the earnings link only rises if earnings are rising too. Is a wealthy country not going to afford that dignity for our pensioners?\" she told the cheering conference. </p> <p>Last night the government avoided further embarrassment over a motion proposed by the TGWU union, calling on ministers to get rid of the controversial voucher scheme for asylum seekers. </p> <p>Union negotiators, enjoying a rare show of muscle, won a concession that will result in a statement from Labour's executive today, promising immediate abolition of the \"no change\" rule which denies asylum seekers any cash back in return for unspent value on their vouchers. There will also be a review. </p> <p>Behind last night's pensions vote lay the determination of the big three unions, the TGWU, the GMB general union and Unison, with 2.8m members between them - 60% of the unions' votes at Labour conferences. The AEEU engineering union stayed loyal. </p> <p>Details of the 60.21% to 39.79% vote showed that the constituency delegates, with half the votes at the conference, had been persuaded by last-minute appeals from Alistair Darling, the social security secretary, and his veteran deputy, Jeff Rooker. </p> <p>The rank and file backed the Blair-Brown line by 64% to 36%. It was the massive 84.17% to 15.83% No from the union section that ensured victory for the motion demanding restoration of the earnings link abolished by Margaret Thatcher in 1979. Had she not done so, the single pension would now be \u00a397 a week, not \u00a367.50. </p> <p>\"It's not that we're not listening, but it's been clear throughout that we're not going to restore the link,\" said a senior Blair aide. The chancellor's team was even blunter. \"We won the argument on the conference floor and we have lost a battle. But we will win the war,\" predicted one. </p> <p>With one in six pensioners enjoying \u00a320,000-plus pensions, it is better to target the neediest, say ministers, even though electoral necessity this week forced Mr Blair and Mr Brown to say there will be big across-the-board increases, probably \u00a35 to \u00a38 a week, before polling day. </p> <p>Rodney Bickerstaffe, general secretary of Unison, who is to succeed Jack Jones at the head of the national pensioners convention, showed personal regret - absent from the speech by the GMB's John Edmonds - in the conciliatory tone of his appeal to the platform for magnanimity. \"I beg you, no bullying,\" he said. </p> <p>Last night the GMB accused Mr Brown of intransigence, to the alleged annoyance of Mr Blair. But No 10 and No 11 were united in rejecting the charge. The stickler was Mr Edmonds, they countered. </p> <p>Both Mr Bickerstaffe and Bill Morris of the TGWU would happily have \"remitted\" the motion for further discussion, as the leadership wanted, they claimed. </p> <p>Mr Darling told the conference: \"The question is not whether we spend more, but how we do it.\" He stressed that to end poverty among Britain's 11m pensioners \"it must be right to help people with the lowest incomes first\".</p>",
  "The government last night agreed to an immediate and wide-ranging review of its controversial voucher scheme for asylum seekers and the scrapping of the \"no-change\" rule on voucher use to head off a conference defeat today. <p>Transport and General Workers' Union leader Bill Morris, who has made the campaign against vouchers a personal crusade, is now expected to support a Labour national executive statement and avoid pressing the union's motion opposing vouchers to a vote. </p> <p>The union has been given an understanding that the review will lead to the end of the voucher system, the TGWU said. </p> <p>Under the scheme, introduced in April to cut the numbers coming to Britain, asylum seekers are given vouchers to buy groceries and other essentials from selected stores, but are not allowed change if the cost of the goods is less than the value of a voucher. </p> <p>Tony Blair has been personally involved in negotiations all week in Brighton aimed at securing a compromise formula and avoiding a head-to-head confrontation on asylum policy with the country's most prominent black public figure. </p> <p>Mr Morris plans to tell delegates today his union is determined to end a \"degrading and inhuman system which creates new targets for racist attacks\" and the \"grotesque situation where taxpayers and asylum seekers are subsidising Sainsbury's and Tesco\" because of the \"no change\" rule. </p> <p>The TGWU yesterday released a dossier the union has used to lobby ministers for an end to the voucher scheme, including evidence of its link to racist harassment. </p> <p>Sodexho, the private company running the scheme on behalf of the government, has advertised vouchers to retailers as a \"revenue-making opportunity\", while both Safeway and Sainsbury's have expressed embarrassment at \"profiting from asylum-seekers\". </p> <p>Although ministers conceded a review of the voucher scheme at Labour's national policy forum in July, the TGWU said yesterday the new committment to an immediate review according to agreed criteria was a breakthrough. </p> <p>Both sides accept that if the TGWU's motion opposing vouchers is put to the conference, it will win a strong majority among union and constituency delegates alike.</p>",
  "Ohio lies at the heart of a nation still wavering over who it wants to be president. In fact, if there was a meridian of indecision running through the country, it would bisect this swing state, through Montgomery, its most evenly balanced county, down the middle of Dayton and under the feet of Felix Garfunkel. <p>Mr Garfunkel's vote, like the state of Ohio, is up for grabs. And with 40 days until the US goes to the polls, his opinions - and those of his fellow floating Daytonians - could prove decisive. Historically, the candidate who wins Montgomery county usually wins Ohio, and the winner in Ohio almost always wins the presidency. </p> <p>Mr Garfunkel, out shopping in the aptly named Dayton suburb of Centerville, is having a hard time deciding. </p> <p>\"I'm waiting for the debates to make up my mind,\" he says. \"I will see what the positions of the two are. Gore has promised a lot, but those things have yet to be proved. But Bush hasn't given details of what he thinks either.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush's lead in the state has narrowed to 4%, which is virtually insignificant, statistically speaking. In Dayton and the surrounding Montgomery county, the two candidates are running neck and neck with the support of 49% of likely voters apiece. Dayton's decision could be critical in determining the allocation of Ohio's precious 21 votes in the electoral college, which formally decides the presidency. </p> <p>Mr Garfunkel is 69 years old and shares the concerns of his fellow pensioners about the ballooning cost of prescription medicines and the fate of the state-funded Medicare system. But he admits he does not have a clear idea of either candidate's plans. </p> <p>Mark Taylor, 45, a respiratory therapist at a Dayton hospital is in the same boat. \"To be honest, there's not an easy answer,\" he says. \"I'm not real happy with either side. I'm not happy with the whole concept of politics. I think as far as the economy is concerned it's going a little bit easier on us. But I'm not sure if that has anything to do with Mr Gore.\" </p> <p>Ralph Nader, the environmentalist contender, is a man of real integrity, the Centerville voter believes, but as he is not going to win, what is the point? </p> <p>Other shoppers have more concrete views. Most of the white, middle-class residents are long-term Republicans who say they are still sickened by the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal, and angry with the vice-president for not resigning in disgust. Most of the black Daytonians are traditional Democrats whose party loyalty was set in stone 40 years ago, in the civil rights struggle. </p> <p>There is no reason to believe that the range of views in Centerville is very different from anywhere else in the great undecided heartland. It certainly looks like a thousand other quietly prosperous suburbs around the country. Regional unemployment - at 4% - is at a post-war low. The shopping malls are full and most of the cars parked along the shaded streets seem to have been bought in the last five years. </p> <p>In Dayton, a city of about 180,000, the scars of de-industrialisation are visible - empty sites where cars were once assembled for General Motors, whose jobs have gone to cheaper labour in Mexico and Asia. But those scars are being quickly smoothed over. The sleek offices of hi-tech companies have transformed the outskirts of town. </p> <p>\"There is a sense of contentment and a general lack of commitment,\" Jim Walker, a politics professor at Dayton's Wright State University, says. \"You will normally get a third partisan Republicans, a third Democrats and a third who just don't pay any attention. Ohio perhaps has more of those. I've found about 42 or 43% who just don't identify. That mostly means they don't pay attention.\" </p> <p>Prof Walker argues that the usual neat profile of a swing voter - someone carefully weighing their interests and options in the light of the party platforms - is a false one. Confusion, ignorance of the issues and disinterest are far more common. </p> <p>Certainly, the opinions expressed in Centerville appeared to be based on gut feeling rather than careful calculation. \"With many people\", Prof Walker says, \"the last good idea they hear will be the one they go for.\" </p> <p>The candidates have visited Ohio about a dozen times since the August conventions, and will visit another dozen times before the election, in the hope of providing that decisive \"good idea\". </p> <p>During a visit last week, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Joe Lieberman, told a crowd of supporters: \"If the Gore-Lieberman ticket carries Ohio, that's it folks - the other side doesn't have a chance. </p> <p>\"I'm not trying to put pressure on you but the future of America is on your shoulders.\"</p>",
  "He is a member of what has been described as \"the most dysfunctional family in Canada\", a murderer, drug dealer and career criminal. <p>Yesterday, Philip Wood stepped off a plane at Heathrow, bought himself a coffee and disappeared unchecked into a new life in Britain. </p> <p>Wood, 44, one of four brothers who together were dubbed \"the Canadian Krays\", was deported from Canada after being given parole. He had served 14 years of a life sentence for murdering a young woman. He was convicted along with two of his brothers. </p> <p>As he walked through the airport, the man described by one psychiatrist as \"psychotic\", and by another as having a personality disorder and being a borderline psychopath, looked calm and relaxed. </p> <p>Wearing dark glasses and a baseball cap and carrying just a holdall and a small backpack, he said, in a heavy Canadian accent, that he would need to take time to adjust to freedom. </p> <p>Wood was escorted to Britain by two Canadian immigration officials and met by two British officers. </p> <p>It is unclear where he will go, though his brother Douglas - deported to the UK in 1985, manacled to the flight deck of a military aircraft because he was deemed to be so violent - is believed to live in the Swindon area. </p> <p>Wood said yesterday his wish was to \"just disappear\" in Scotland and pleaded to be allowed to lead an \"honest, hard-working and peaceful life.\" </p> <p>He told the Glasgow Evening Times: \"I don't know anything about the Scottish culture, I'll just learn as I go.\" Wood admitted \"I deserved what I got\", but said: \"I did 16 years in a prison cell to reflect on it. There is nothing positive about someone dying and there is also nothing positive about a man staying in jail all these years. But it happened and it's a chapter in my life that I wish hadn't.\" </p> <p>Like other criminals deported to the UK, Wood will be free to come and go as he pleases: there are no controls over him because his crimes were committed outside this country. </p> <p>He told the Glasgow Evening Times: \"I am not a threat to anyone. I would not harm anyone. I just hope society forgives me and realises I have paid my debt.\" </p> <p>But he went on: \"I suppose I could be dangerous, but then so can everyone else. Given the right set of circumstances, anybody can kill.\" </p> <p>Last night, a spokesperson for the Home Office said: \"The government recognises the lack of supervision of returning offenders as a problem and is considering how best to deal with it. </p> <p>\"It is pursuing the ratification of an additional protocol to the Council of Europe convention on the transfer of sentenced persons to remove the consent needed of the prisoner being transferred.\" </p> <p>If this is successful, prisoners due to be deported will be transferred to a UK prison at an earlier stage in their sentence and will become subject to UK supervision arrangements on their release. </p> <p>The Canadian government has been criticised for what is the latest in a number of cases where immigration authorities have deported criminals whose parents had failed to take out citizenship for them. </p> <p>Glasgow Labour MP Michael Martin has accused Canadian authorities of using Scotland \"as a dustbin for social misfits\". </p> <p>The Wood family emigrated to Canada from Ayrshire in Scotland in 1965 when the four sons, David, Philip, Colin and Douglas, were aged between six and eight. </p> <p>From their teenage years until three of them were jailed for murder they had racked up more than 100 offences for drug trafficking, assault and robbery. They are said to have ruled the town of Guelph, near Toronto, and boasted that they could earn up to $30,000 a month from their drug dealing. </p> <p>In 1986, Philip, David and Colin Wood were convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life. They had killed Karen Thomson, 21, who was due to give evidence against Colin Wood in an impending court case. </p> <p>David Wood will be eligible for parole in a few months time and will also be deported. Colin Wood will not be eligible for a number of years because he escaped from prison and went on the run in the US. </p> <p>He featured on Canda's 10 most wanted list for three years until he was caught pumping gas at an Alabama filling station. </p> <p>In interviews with the BBC programme Frontline Scotland, the three brothers talked about their crimes and the fact that they would be sent to the UK, a country they know little about. They showed little remorse. </p> <p>Michael Prue, a lawyer who handled the deportation orders for the brothers, told Frontline Scotland: \"Every time I dealt with a member of their family, including the four of them who were under order of deportation, the one who's gone back, the mother who came to give evidence, they made your blood run cold. They really don't care about people. They don't care who they hurt. They don't care provided they get what they want. They wanted money, they wanted drugs, they wanted women, they wanted power. They wanted that, they didn't care what they had to do to get it.\" </p> <p>Mr Prue conceded that there was no doubt \"that they learned a great deal of their bad ways, their hostility, their anger while they were here and while they were growing up\" but he said that ultimately they were British. </p> <p>Yesterday, a journalist who met all three brothers at their three separate jails in Canada said Philip \"appeared to be the most dangerous\" of the brothers. </p> <p>\"He was very quietly spoken with manic, dancing eyes. He showed absolutely no sense of guilt or regret. The other two seemed to have accepted what they had done but he didn't. They were all blaming each other for the murder of the girl. </p> <p>\"Philip was certainly the least contrite. He had that kind of slightly unsettling charm about him but the longer you looked there was a flint there, a real steeliness about him. </p> <p>\"He was the least convincing when it came to his rehabilitation. I suspect that if it hadn't been for the fact that he was a British citizen he would certainly still be in prison in Canada now. </p> <p>\"The Canadian authorities wanted rid of these guys as soon as they could.\"<br> <b>Criminal exports home and away</b><br> </p> <p>\u0095 Archie \"Mad Dog\" McAfferty was sent back to Scotland in May 1997 after serving 23 years in an Australian prison for three murders in a five day killing spree. </p> <p>\u0095 In December 1998, Anthony Fallis, 32, was found dead in a Toronto river just 22 days after being deported to Scotland.

  "<p>Brian Woods has a single statistic to explain why people should watch Slavery (tonight, Channel 4). \"I don't think that anyone who is told that there is more slavery on earth today than there has been in human history can fail to be astonished and appalled by the fact.\" Sure, there is a flip response available to the terminally cynical: since there are many more people alive now than there have been, there are more people than ever in most categories. But that kind of answer crumbles when you see the film. </p> <p>Anti-Slavery, one of the oldest pressure groups in the world, estimates that there are over 20 million slaves in the world today. Those statistics are very rough, of course, because slavery is illegal everywhere, and no one is volunteering their ownership figures. But we are talking about slaves . Not your average woefully underpaid, intimidated, overworked Filipino or Guatemalan teenager in a sweatshop. These are people held against their will, coerced to work with the threat of violence, and paid nothing at all. </p> <p>Brian Woods and Kate Blewett are a talkative pair who have made a string of high profile documentaries (The Dying Rooms, Innocents Lost) mainly concerning the abuse and exploitation of children. Their new programme explores three uses of slavery today: Indian children kidnapped and forced to work on carpet looms; Malian migrant workers on cocoa plantations in Cte d'Ivoire, and domestic servants in Washington and London. Woods says they chose these groups because \"We wanted a way of bringing it home to people in the West and not letting it be something people could watch and go 'isn't it terrible what people in far off lands do to other people in far off lands'.\" </p> <p>The story that holds the film together is that of Huro, a missing boy from a small village in Bihar. Blewett and Woods accompanied his father on the search to try to find him working the carpet looms. It is a heart-tugging story, without any doubt. Which makes this a kind of journalism that not everyone is comfortable with, with emotional story lines and the open participation of pressure groups. But Blewett is explicit about what they are trying to do. \"This is a campaigning film, not a current affairs programme\", she says. \"If we can spread the awareness, that can be the beginning of changes.\" </p> <p>Woods elaborates, \"The public get angry about individual stories that are representative of the whole. If you tell the broad story in a current affairs style, people can go 'yes, that's a great shame' and get on with the next programme. The only way to get a strong emotional response from people is to give them the human story and to give them an individual they can care about. Obviously, just that is not sufficient. You also need to give people the facts, and let them know what they can do.\" </p> <p>And as Blewett explains, this also means abandoning some of the conventions of investigative journalism. \"We don't want to get the government responses in, or the big companies. We don't want to go to a chocolate company and say 'we found slavery on the plantations where there's a huge chance that your cocoa is emerging from'. We know what they are going to say. We don't want to waste a portion of our film giving people the right to reply, so it's much better if we keep all the named people out and leave it as a subject like 'chocolate' or 'the carpet industry' and leave the people who watch it to bring it round to the people involved.\" </p> <p>Likewise, Woods makes no apologies about the well-crafted narrative structure of a film whose highlights include a police raid, and a trip to a cocoa plantation in Cte d'Ivoire that Blewett describes as the scariest incident in her life. \"What we are trying to do is to set the viewers to respond emotionally. The most successful way to do that is really to use the dramatic techniques of feature films, where a story is unfolding, and you're pulling people in, and you're making it difficult to switch off.\" And it does work, partly because it exposes a level of degradation that even the most globally aware members of the audience will be shocked by. </p> <p>And what brings it home are the products involved: those Indian rugs everyone comes back with, touted as something that suggests they understand the Third World. And cocoa, basis for the chocolate that this country seems to run on. The film's strongest point, the one that sticks in your mind, is the deeply scarred Malian asked about his thoughts about people who eat chocolate. \"They enjoyed something I suffered to make; I worked hard for them, but saw no benefit. They are eating my flesh.\" But the film isn't just meant to make you feel guilty, implicated. It's meant to make you want to do something. And you can do something, as the one (comparatively) positive story shows. Brazilian charcoal workers used to be slaves, until international pressure brought a change. Today, they don't earn much, and they are overworked in unhealthy conditions. But at least they've got their freedom, and they've got a chance. </p> <p>Slavery, tonight, 9pm, Channel 4.

  "<p>Not many choreographers, when commissioned to create a new version of Romeo and Juliet, would rush off to re-read George Orwell's 1984. But Angelin Preljocaj, currently one of Europe's most sought-after dance- makers, has a reputation for seeing the past through deviant eyes. His repertoire includes classics from the Ballets Russes repertoire, which have been reinvented as transgressive, erotic fables, and a ballet about Casanova (created for Paris Opera), whose disturbingly clinical images of corruption included star ballerina Isabella Guerin reciting aloud from a medical textbook on VD. Its premiere at the Palais Garnier caused a satisfying scandal. </p> <p>Romeo and Juliet was actually commissioned back in 1989 by Lyons Opera Ballet, when Preljocaj was barely known outside the small world of experimental modern dance. He almost declined the project, since a work involving 30 ballet dancers and one of the world's most grandiloquent scores seemed too much of a giant to tilt at. But when he considered the essence of Shakespeare's story - lovers punished under a dictatorial regime - an Orwellian dystopia seemed to make irresistible sense of it. As he says, \"I thought of a world, like some eastern Europe state, where everyone was under surveillance, under control. I liked the contrast between this very deep and sweet love and this very hard, cold, political situation. I thought it would make the love story even more fragile.\" </p> <p>Reading the novel, he was entranced on rediscovering that its heroine was called Julia - \"it seemed a sign\" - and his own version of Juliet evolved into the daughter of a Ceaucescu-style dictator, while his Romeo was a homeless drifter. \"Finally each lover needs what the other has - Romeo has no power and no money, and Juliet has no freedom.\" </p> <p>But Preljocaj's scenario wasn't just inspired by Orwell: it also chimes profoundly with his own family history. Though he's a French national, he was born in France in 1957, only two weeks after his Albanian parents fled their country as political dissidents. \"They were on the government's red list,\" he says. \"They were in danger of being shot.\" Throughout his childhood, Preljocaj learned what it means to be split between two cultures and two loyalties. Living within a tight-knit community of Albanian exiles in Paris, he says his own home was \"a little Albania ... Like all people coming from the outside my parents didn't want to lose their identities so they lived very traditionally. At home we spoke a different language, ate differently, listened to different music.\" Yet like any kid, Preljocaj was desperate to fit in - \"I was like a child with two heads\" - so outside home he was more French than the French. </p> <p>When I spoke to him in Aix en Provence, where he and his dance company are now based, Preljocaj certainly looked like a native. He is neat and graceful in an unmistakably French style (trainers, jeans and T-shirt thrown together in a perfectly judged combination). But his eyes are of a blackness that suggest a more exotic provenance, as does the golden burnish of his skin. Today he feels that his divided upbringing served him well - creating a free zone in his personality. \"All my culture is from France,\" he says, \"but there is another part that comes from a more ethnic side, that is more instinctive, more mysterious maybe.\" </p> <p>It may have been that displaced imagination that allowed him, as a refugee kid in a tough Paris suburb, to fall in love with dance. At the age of 10, Preljocaj saw a picture of Nureyev in a book. There hadn't been any dance in his background except \"some traditional dancing at weddings\", but this photo spoke to him directly. \"He was in a jump and his head was very illuminated. The title of the photo was something like 'Nureyev, transfigured by dance', and I thought: What is dance that it can make someone look so beautiful?\" </p> <p>For the next six years, Preljocaj avidly attended ballet classes to find out, but at 16 he started to feel the pressure of being the only boy in his gang of rock'n'roll-crazed friends who studied dance. By that time, too, he was finding the academic discipline of ballet restricting. \"It was always the same steps. I felt I could interpret but I couldn't express myself.\" For a while he stopped dancing completely. Then he saw some modern dance and \"it finally clicked for me. I saw how I could be moving my body in a creative way\". </p> <p>France's impressive support for dance meant that soon after founding his own company in 1984, Preljocaj was fast-tracked through the national funding scheme and based in one of the regional choreographic centres. From there his reputation spread worldwide. One reason for his popularity is that his style is so non-partisan - Preljocaj is equally articulate in ballet and modern dance and is simply interested in having a sufficiently rich palette to say what he wants to say. He is also able to create dance that is raw, direct and honest, yet beautiful to look at. His work is simultaneously glamorous and subversive, and it keeps reinventing itself. </p> <p>Such is his appeal that Ballet Preljocaj perform a packed touring schedule, while he receives more invitations than he can manage for other companies. He is also being courted to run Berlin's soon-to-be-expanded ballet company. </p> <p>Such success could make an artist complacent, but Preljocaj has inherited his parents' dissident energy. Not only does he refuse to work in any situation that bores or offends him artistically, but he will not compromise his politics. For several years he was happily based in the city of Toulon, until the Front National party started to gain power there. \"The week before the city elections I decided that if that party won I would leave. The city is very involved in the company, so these people would be sitting on our board and discussing our policies. </p> <p>It would be impossible. Unfortunately the FN were elected, so for six months we were like in the air\" (and he doesn't just mean Ballet Preljocaj but also his wife and two small daughters). \"But Provence asked us to stay in the region, and finally Aix proposed to us to come.\" Not only has the city given Ballet Preljocaj a home, but it's in the process of constructing a purpose- built base with four studios, wardrobe, offices and a 400-seat theatre. Along with salaries for 24 dancers, it adds up to a deal unique in French modern dance and conditions that British modern dancers would kill for. </p> <p> The expanded size of his company means that Preljocaj has been able to claim large-scale works such as Romeo and Juliet for his own repertoire, a work he believes has grown more relevant in recent times. The eastern bloc may have disintegrated, but other, newer Romeo and Juliet tragedies have emerged. \"I've read all these stories - like about a Serbian guy and a Bosnian girl. Romeo and Juliet will always be modern because there will always be conflict between people.\" </p> <p>For Preljocaj, though, the personal consequences of the new Europe have been happy. In 1992 he was allowed into Albania for the first time, invited by the government to perform with his company, and bring his parents with him. Not only did he get to meet his grandparents, but the day before he left he had lunch with the new president, who asked if he'd been able to visit his father's home village, in the mountains in the north. </p> <p>When Preljocaj said his schedule didn't allow for such a journey, the president offered to fly him and his parents there in a military helicopter. Telling this anecdote, Preljocaj is cynically alert to its politics. \"Bon,\" he snorts, \"of course when we arrived, there were television cameras, newsmen everywhere. It was very good publicity for the government.\" But he is also moved by the fairy-tale symmetry of it all. \"When my mother escaped from Albania she carried me with her, inside her. Thirty-five years later I brought her and my father back again. It was something very special, very strange.\" </p> <p>Ballet Preljocaj's Romeo and Juliet is at Sadler's Wells, London EC1, from October 3. Box office: 020-7863 8000.</p>",
  "For three decades John Banville has been refining the exquisite, mandarin style that is his hallmark, and establishing himself as the finest writer of the confessional narrative since Nabokov. While he has moved around within time - he wrote an enduring historical triptych about Kepler, Copernicus and Newton - his mode of delivery has hardly changed during his career. <p>Certain colours - silver, gold, blue - dominate his descriptive palette; certain types of characters recur - the shambling, brutish, self-deceiving male narrator, the big-haunched, strident female; certain obsessions condition the texture of the prose - the solidity of light, for instance, and its ability to fall geometrically as rhomboids, panes or columns. Critics of Banville insinuate that though he plays it expertly, he has only got one tune. </p> <p>Banville clearly doesn't listen to them, however, because his new novel Eclipse is, if anything, an intensifying of his characteristic mannerisms. It consists of a monologue delivered by Alexander Cleave, a celebrated actor whose career ends at its apex when he corpses on-stage in a production of Euripides's Heracles. </p> <p>Anxious to escape the limelight of dishonour, Cleave returns to live alone in his dilapidated childhood home. There, he hopes, he will be able to work out who he really is. By scrutinising his past he will be able to peel back the onion layers of identity accumulated in a lifetime of acting and discover the bare nub of his self. And that is just about all that hap pens in the book. Cleave wanders dreamily about the corridors and rooms of his house, remembering scenes and people from his past, and trying to puzzle out how he got to where he is. </p> <p>Events from reality do intrude into his reveries; a circus comes to town, a malodorous caretaker named Quirke and his feral, 15-year-old daughter, Lily, move into the house; Cleave's wife, Lydia, arrives in a flurry of bangles and cigarette smoke. </p> <p>But these real-time happenings are held at a curious distance - we only witness them through Cleave's digressive prose. Even when something terrible and momentous does finally occur, Cleave's instinctive response is to re-imagine it as a theatrical scene: \"Tragedy always has its anonymous messengers; in sandals and robe they run in fleet-footed from the wings and fall to one knee before the throne, heads bowed, leaning on the caduceus.\" </p> <p>Eclipse is Banville's boldest book to date precisely because there is so little plot to it. The Untouchable (1997) fictionalised the life of Anthony Blunt, Poussin expert and most fastidious of the four famous Cambridge spies; it contained within it the narrative drive of known history. </p> <p>Here, however, there is nothing at all to distract from the language - the novel is a carefully made display case for Banville's burnished prose. Fortunately, it stands up to scrutiny. He has a scrupulous eye for visual detail - a shaving cut dabbed at with tissue is \"a white floweret with a tiny rust-red heart\"; pond-skimmers' feet make \"pewtery dents\" on the surface of a pond - but also a fondness for splendid, elaborate images; a word or idea in a sentence can suddenly fling open the door on to an unexpected antechamber of metaphor: \"It is late, the light is going. I see what was my life adrift behind me, going smaller and smaller with distance, like a city on an ice floe caught in a current, its twinkling lights, its palaces and spires and slums, all miraculously intact, all hopelessly beyond reach.\" </p> <p>That The Untouchable, a magnificent novel, didn't even make it on to the Booker Prize shortlist was a disgrace to the prize. In Eclipse, Banville has created another important, challenging fiction. The book is ornately written, heartless in an honest fashion, profoundly interrogative of ideas of identity and, above all, spectacularly beautiful. It is, in ways that so many contemporary novels are not, a work of art.</p>",
  "<p> 'Power to the people\" may not arouse much passion as a political slogan, but 25 years ago, the idea of \"computer power to the people\" helped start a revolution. Rather than being controlled by white-coated technocrats working for governments and giant corporations, computers should be available to everyone - which implied they must also be affordable and easy to use. </p> <p>It also implied that, if there was a market for market for personal computers, some people could have lots of fun and become very rich supplying them. Thousands of companies were founded to sell the new types of hardware and software the new industry required. Most promised far more than they could deliver, which is not uncommon with revolutions. Even so, it is impossible not to be impressed by the personal computer's growth in power and performance, and its market penetration. </p> <p>Today, PCs can be found in more than 50% of American homes - a far bigger proportion than any of the pioneers seriously believed. Where California's Silicon Valley has led the way, the rest of the world has followed. </p> <p>Intel made the revolution possible by designing the first microprocessor - a \"computer on a chip\" - in 1971, but it really started in Albuquerque, New Mexico. That is where a small company called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, MITS, run by Ed Roberts, made backyard model rockets and pocket calculators. MITS probably did not develop the first personal computer, but it put together the first hobbyist construction kit to capture the American imagination. It also came up with a catchy name, Altair 8800, derived from an episode of Star Trek. </p> <p>The MITS Altair helped set standards that encouraged the commercial use of personal computers, and some of them are still visible today. MITS used two products: an Intel 8080 chip, the ancestor of today's Pentium, and Digital Research's CP/M operating system, which could be used today by anyone familiar with MS DOS (Microsoft Disc Operating System). </p> <p>The Altair also ran a version of Basic (Beginners all-purpose symbolic instruction code) written by a teenager called Bill Gates and his friend Paul Allen. They were inspired to write it after seeing the Altair featured on the cover of Popular Electronics magazine. They moved to the Sundowner Motel in Albuquerque to be close to their only customer, with Gates dropping out of Harvard and Allen taking a job at MITS. There, in 1975, they co-founded Microsoft. </p> <p>MITS did not last long, but the Altair inspired dozens of companies to develop similar CP/M machines, most of which could share parts. These came to dominate the small business market for personal computers, but were not really suitable for domestic use. </p> <p>However, dozens more companies targeted home users with less expandable but better integrated machines. The main ones were the Apple II, Commodore PET (Personal Electronic Transactor) and Tandy TRS-80, all launched in 1977. </p> <p>In 1978, Science of Cambridge (later Sinclair Computers) launched the MK14 microcomputer kit for \u00a339.95 plus VAT, then the ZX80, ZX81, Spectrum and QL. In 1979, another Cambridge company, Acorn, launched the System 1 microcomputer kit for \u00a365 plus VAT, followed by the Atom, the Proton, the Electron, and the Archimedes. Actually, what would have been the Proton became much better known as the BBC Micro, announced in 1982. </p> <p> The BBC's adoption of the Acorn as the basis for a government-backed computer literacy programme shows what a grip the personal computer had already gained over the popular imagination. </p> <p>Unfortunately for Acorn, and dozens of similar start-ups, the future of the computer industry had already been decided. The microcomputer business had grown too big for IBM to ignore, and on August 18, 1981, it launched the IBM Personal Computer. </p> <p>IBM was by far the biggest computer company ever (with $87.5bn in annual sales, it still is) and part of its job was to set standards. That is what it did with the IBM PC. But for whatever reasons, including earlier failures, \"time to market\" and pressure from a long-running US government anti-trust case, IBM did not take its usual line of shipping a box with an IBM processor, an IBM operating system, and IBM-everything else. Instead, it based its PC on an Intel 8088 processor and Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system. It was, it turned out, handing its 40-year monopoly of corporate data processing to a couple of upstarts. </p> <p>In 1980, IBM had a turnover of $26bn and annual profits of $3.6bn, so perhaps it felt no need to fear a tiny company like Microsoft, which had only 40 staff. And while IBM realised that Microsoft and Intel would sell their stuff to all-comers, it perhaps didn't imagine that small, unknown companies would make better, faster IBM PC-compatibles and outsell the mighty IBM. But start-ups such as Compaq and Dell were soon on the way to doing exactly that. </p> <p>By setting a standard, IBM did the industry a service. Most personal computers produced up to that point had been incompatible with one another, even if they used the same chip. The Acorn BBC B, Apple II, Commodore 64 Atari 800,and others all used the MOS Technology 6502 processor, but software houses had to write a new version of their program for each machine. Given the cost and the time required, they often didn't bother, leaving these proprietary machines struggling for applications. By contrast, any PC program would run on machines from hundreds (later, thousands) of manufacturers. This helped propel the growing market for PCs and PC clones. </p> <p>The Altair 8800 and IBM's PC and PC AT (Advanced Technology) computers also led to a fundamental change in the way the industry was organised. Until then, the fashion had been for \"vertical integration\", with each manufacturer producing as much as possible in house. This could provide a better integrated system, but also created \"lock-in\": customers had few alternatives and could not easily \"defect\" to a rival supplier. </p> <p>Many early microcomputer firms, such as Apple and Commodore, followed this proprietary line.But they could not sustain the huge research and development required, and all struggled, were taken over, or went bust. </p> <p> By constrast, the PC market of the 1980s was based on \"horizontal integration\". Whatever PC you bought, it had an x86-compatible processor supplied by Intel, AMD, IBM, NEC or whoever, a version of DOS from Microsoft, IBM or Digital Research, and the manufacturer's choice of graphics card, hard drive, keyboard, memory, and screen. Choosing the \"best of breed\" created intense competition between parts suppliers, which led to rapid innovation, increased capabilities, and (usually) lower prices. </p> <p>Microsoft was in the thick of the competition in two areas. First, there was the need to replace DOS with a more powerful multi-tasking operating system (one that could do more than one thing at once). Second, there was the long-term aim of introducing a mouse-driven graphical user interface, to make computers easier to use. This had been part of the dream since 1968, when Doug Engelbart of the Stanford Research Institute demonstrated the first mouse, and it continued in the 70s at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Centre (Parc). Xerox's work provided the inspiration for Apple's Lisa and Macintosh computers, Microsoft's Windows, and Digital Research's GEM (Graphical Environment Manager) interface, which also appeared on the Atari ST home computer. </p> <p>In the 1970s, Xerox Parc was a decade ahead of the rest of the world, with its graphical interfaces and networks of personal computers connected to laser printers, which it sometimes showed off to visitors such as Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. But while it did launch some products, such as the Xerox Star 8010 in May 1981, they were expensive and never achieved commercial success. Instead of making Xerox rich, Parc's ideas enriched the industry, as firms such as Apple and Microsoft hired away their staff. </p> <p>At first, Microsoft had seen AT&amp;T's Unix as the obvious replacement for DOS, and announced its own version, Xenix. But while powerful, Unix was notoriously hard to use, and required more power than most PC users could afford. It also came in too many incompatible \"flavours\", of which Xenix was merely one. In 1987, Microsoft and IBM combined to launch OS/2 as a DOS replacement. However, since it didn't control the market and couldn't control IBM, Microsoft also wanted to hedge its bets. It didn't abandon Windows, and it opportunistically hired a group of defectors from Digital Equipment to write another DOS/Unix replacement, which appeared as Windows NT (New Technology). </p> <p>Some saw Microsoft's actions as treachery. Others recognised that IBM was trying to wrest back its control of the industry from Microsoft, Intel, Compaq and the rest. This plan revolved around OS/2 (later transferred to IBM's sole ownership), a proprietary MCA (Micro Channel Architecture) expansion bus, and Systems Application Architecture - a schema designed to tie IBM's Personal Systems (PS/2) to large IBM minicomputer and mainframe systems. Compaq formed a \"Gang of Nine\" to support a plausible alternative future, and IBM's plan failed. </p> <p>Next, IBM formed an alliance with Apple, which adopted IBM's PowerPC chip. They were still the two biggest personal computer suppliers in the US, and thought they could take on Intel. They were wrong, and later, Apple bottled out of the plan to move to a common hardware reference platform (CHRP) agreed between IBM, Apple, and Motorola. IBM then abandoned the launch of its own Power Personal Systems. </p> <p>The balance of power had already tipped Wintel's way in 1990, when Microsoft shipped Windows 3.0. Unlike OS/2, it was cheap, and easy to adopt. Users could even buy graphical applications such as Microsoft Word for Windows and the Excel spreadsheet (both first developed for the Apple Macintosh) and Corel Draw. </p> <p>At the time, Microsoft's turnover was only $1bn a year while IBM's was $67bn, so Big Blue was not about to admit defeat. It pumped vast amounts of cash into OS/2, promoting it as \"a better Windows than Windows\", until the stunning success of Microsoft Windows 95 sealed its fate. From that point on, Microsoft was clearly the computer industry's top dog, and sales of Windows-based PCs exploded. Microsoft's turnover grew from $1bn to $23bn during the decade, despite the continuous attentions of the Federal Trade Commission and the US Justice Department. </p> <p>Their investigations culminated in a trial in which Microsoft's business practices were comprehensively damned, leading Justice Penfied Jackson to order the break-up of the company - a decision now pending appeal. </p> <p>What is interesting is that, during the 1990s, despite its monopoly power, Microsoft was no more able to replace the DOS-Windows combination than anybody else. </p> <p>The Windows NT operating system, introduced in 1993, was supposed to do it. NT was designed to run on a range of different processors (Intel, Mips, DEC Alpha, PowerPC), to use more than one processor at once, and to offer the reliability and stability of rivals such as OS/2 and Unix. Despite various inducements, such as letting companies install NT for the same price as Windows 95, sales struggled. Three times, Microsoft has announced that the latest version of DOS-Windows (Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me) would be the last of the line, giving users little choice about moving to NT (now called Windows 2000). So far, it has not made it stick. </p> <p>Apple Macintosh users have been equally conservative, declining to move to technically superior systems such as Steve Jobs's NeXT or Be's BeOS, launched on the dual-processor BeBox. It remains to be seen if Jobs, the Apple co-founder who retuned to the company at the end of 1977, can shift them to an updated version of NeXT's Unix-based operating system, Mac OS X (see page 12 for a review of this system). </p> <p>That's the problem with revolutions: they may be exciting, but most users prefer evolution. They don't what to risk losing what they have in some great leap into the unknown. The result may be boring, but it is a sign of the personal computer's success that what started as a revolution has become the status quo. </p> <p> Which is not to say that progress has stopped. It has, rather, moved to handheld devices such as electronic organisers and mobile phones, to sealed-box \"appliances\" such as WebTV sets and games consoles, and most importantly, to the internet. And as the growth of the personal computer market has slowed, many PC companies - including Intel and Microsoft - have invested heavily in these new areas in search of the Next Big Thing. </p> <p>For a couple of decades, Microsoft's mission statement summed up the ambition of the PC industry: to put a computer on every desk and in every home. </p> <p>That has been changed to take in every type of device used anywhere at any time. The only argument is about whether we are entering the \"Post PC\" era, as some pundits claim, or the \"PC Plus\" era of Microsoft's new .Net (dot.net) vision, where the net, rather than the PC, is the software platform. </p> <p>Whatever happens, I expect companies raised in an industry based on rapid innovation and cut-throat competition will adapt and survive. Old and slow minicomputer and mainframe companies were generally unable to live with PC-based competitors, and old and slow consumer electronics and telecoms companies may be in for a big surprise. </p> <p><strong> Twenty five years of personal computing</strong></p> <p> <strong> 1975</strong> </p> <p> MITS Altair 8800 </p> <p>Microsoft Basic </p> <p> <strong> 1977</strong> </p> <p> Apple II </p> <p>Commodore PET </p> <p>Tandy TRS-80 </p> <p> <strong> 1980</strong> </p> <p> Sinclair ZX80 </p> <p> <strong> 1981</strong> </p> <p> IBM Personal Computer </p> <p>Microsoft MS-DOS </p> <p> <strong> 1982</strong> </p> <p> Acorn BBC B </p> <p>Commodore 64 </p> <p> <strong> 1984</strong> </p> <p> Apple Macintosh </p> <p>IBM PC AT </p> <p> Atari ST </p> <p>Commodore Amiga </p> <p> <strong> 1987</strong> </p> <p> IBM PS/2 and OS/2 </p> <p> <strong> 1988</strong> </p> <p> NeXT Cube </p> <p> <strong> 1990</strong> </p> <p> Microsoft Windows 3 </p> <p> <strong> 1991</strong> </p> <p> Apple-IBM deal </p> <p> <strong> 1993</strong> </p> <p> Intel Pentium </p> <p>Microsoft Windows NT </p> <p> <strong> 1994</strong> </p> <p> Apple Power Macs </p> <p>IBM OS/2 Warp 3 </p> <p> <strong> 1995</strong> </p> <p> Microsoft Windows 95 </p> <p> <strong> 1997</strong> </p> <p> Apple buys NeXT </p> <p> <strong> 2000</strong> </p> <p> Microsoft.net announced </p> <p>Apple OS X</p>",
  "<p>The future of my church - the Elim Pentecostal Church on the High Road in Willesden, North-west London - has been radically enhanced, and, indeed, accelerated by using the net. The web provided invaluable help as it disregarded ineffective hierarchies and local constraints to help us. </p> <p>Three years ago, things were a far cry from today. I despaired at the lack of progress as we failed to buy the church building from Brent Council and gain even a single backer in my bid to buy out the bookies next door. The committee was defunct. This situation was grim, so I dumped the deadwood board, asked my congregation to fast for one day a week, and I got on my bike... online! </p> <p>As well as being a minister, I am a keen motorcyclist. A bike can be used for pleasure, but it can also be used for a purpose. Mine is used for the greatest purpose of all - for my Honda FireBlade is on a Mission from Go, as it says on <a href=\"http://www.fasterpastor.com\">my website</a>. So I turned to the biking community for help. </p> <p>Into the night I scoured the world for motorcycle clubs and magazines that could lend support. One by one, with my neighbour's help, we snailmailed, emailed and faxed magazines and clubs from Japan to Mexico. Thousands of pounds began to pour in as the bike press reproduced photographs and stories. Copies were reproduced and sent to the directors of William Hill, owners of the bookies next door, often with a text from Genesis: \"I will not let you go until you bless me!\" After a time a reply came from the national chairman, John Brown. He enclosed a cheque for \u00a3100 and a letter with the words: \"Bless you!\" </p> <p>My hours of surfing down contacts had paid off, the Good Bookies relocated and even provided an interest free loan of \u00a330,000 to help us out. But to convert the place we still needed help. </p> <p>I went back to the web. </p> <p>I found numerous Christian Motorcycle clubs and one in particular, Holy Riders of Norway, a bike club with 800 back-patch wearing members, took a particular interest. </p> <p>They sent a scout to check out my story and look over the premises. Then, as a result of simply finding them on someone's link page, an extraordinary synergy took place. I was invited with my bike to provide training seminars for their chapter leaders, and they raised thousands to enable a major conversion to take place. Now that's surfing! </p> <p>There is a perception of churches being part of an old money establishment or secretly funded from some cult headquarters in America. Then there's that absurd British tradition of referring to \"Organised Religion.\" What's organised about it? If it was organised it wouldn't be going through the floor. </p> <p>In the real world, most local churches are pretty much on their own. To get anywhere, as with a small business, they need outside investment or a mutually benefiting partnership. </p> <p>This is where the internet comes into its own, acting as a huge matchmaking agency. There is no other networking tool that is so international, cross cultural and effective. </p> <p>In the old days you were pretty well confined to members of the same club - hence the need for year books, annual gatherings and the like. Today, through the net, you can be far more abstract and creative in your search for friends. Since the recent introduction of my own site even the timescale for seeing our vision through has been brought forward as key people are now finding me, including national broadsheets and television. There is no other medium where a small local church in a place like Willesden could afford to call out for help and actually be heard. </p> <p>I occasionally visit sites for research, such as <a href=\"http://www.goshen.com\" target=\"_new\">www.goshen.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.ChristianityOnline.com\" target=\"_new\">www.ChristianityOnline.com</a> for wedding jokes or a look at trends and stats but I prefer an old fashioned book for study which, ironically, I tend to buy online. I'm a regular at <a href=\"http://Garyrothwell.com\" target=\"_new\">Garyrothwell.com</a> as his stunt riding tips are second to none, but to me the internet is more than an online encyclopaedia. </p> <p>I see a great future for training youngsters in essential skills. Our teenagers are soon to start selling particularly funny items over the web to finance their future centre. They'll also put an itemised shopping list of everything needed from nails to sound equipment for folk to sponsor through our Netbanx secure server. This will arm them with business and marketing experience long before they leave school, and I've told them, tongue in cheek, their goal is to be the first dot.com millionaires who never made a penny for themselves! </p> <p>The internet has raised our profile, potential and is helping us to help our kids, thus aiding us to transform our community as well. In a fluid and changing situation, it can move with the flow. That's exactly what we need.</p>"
