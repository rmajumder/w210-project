  "<p>Clean and brightly decorated, with shiny new windows and colourful murals on every wall, Chantry Primary School in Gravesend, Kent is a school filled with happy, inquisitive children. But it wasn't always this way. When headteacher Eric Gates, winner of this year's award for Working with Parents and the Community in a primary school, arrived, the school, situated in a deprived area of the town, had been placed in special measures by Ofsted. The father of three knew what had to be done: \"I walked round the corridors and understood that I needed to do something special for these children,\" he says. \"Nobody had put any effort into the school for a long time and while today people say there's a lovely feeling about the place, we've worked very hard to achieve that.\"</p> <p>KS 1 teacher Jane Karabardak, who seconded the chair of governors' nomination, joined the school two terms before Gates. \"The morale of the staff couldn't have been lower when we failed the Ofsted, and the area in general was very depressed. But Eric was very open and honest with the staff and they have backed him all the way.\"</p> <p> One of the first things Gates did was call all the parents into school. \"I said to them 'I am here for your children and want to do something for them.' And the parents actually applauded me and came up and shook my hand. They'd been very angry and that anger had been coming in with the children.\" From day one Gates made a point of being available in the playground at the beginning and end of the school day to help build a rapport with the parents. \"It was important they knew me and understood I was on their side,\" he says. He also sent out weekly newsletters to keep them informed of the school's progress.</p> <p> \"Things happened straight away when Eric arrived,\" says Carol Farrant, a classroom assistant who also has two children at the school. \"The parents trusted him because they could see he was a man of his word.\" Gates initiated the creation of two gardens in derelict quadrangles of land in the school: the multicultural garden has vegetables and plants representing the diverse cultures at Chantry; and the science garden, with its canals linked by a waterwheel and lock gates, offers practical educational learning.</p> <p>Parents came in to work on the gardens; and Gates sourced financial support from local, national and international businesses for his projects. How did he do it? \"I made a lot of noise. Someone clearly needed to be on the school's side.\" </p> <p> His tireless commitment to the school, filling the classrooms with proper resources - from computers and books to decent pencils and paint - took the school out of special measures, building the self-esteem of both pupils and staff, who are now delivering real academic success. When asked how winning the prize made him feel, Gates, who started teaching in 1964, smiles: \"I'm very fortunate to have the right attitude from the staff. It's not an easy school, but you have to have special staff to work with the type of children we have here.\" </p> <p> The school has a diverse selection of nationalities, with many children drawn from local refugee families. Specialised staff are on hand to help children who have English as their second language, and morning assemblies regularly embrace different religions.</p> <p> The children are all bursting to share their opinion of Mr Gates. \"He helped my school,\" says 11-year-old Ryan Bremner, \"because it was going to get knocked down but he came here and made it better.\" Shahzaad Khalid, 10, knows the measure of a good teacher: \"When you were naughty our last headteacher just told you off, but Mr Gates gives you warning letters.\" The school will use the \u00a320,000 prize money to create a new ICT suite; the whole community is eager to come in and use the computers. Three years ago they were ashamed of it, now the locals view Chantry as a valuable and essential resource.</p> <p> Sadly for the pupils and parents of Chantry Primary School, Gates will be retiring at Christmas, but he can enjoy his retirement in the knowledge that not only has he turned the fortunes of the school around, but he has changed the lives of the most important people there: the children.</p> <p> <strong>Regional winners: </strong><br></p> <p> <strong>Eric Gates</strong> South East, Chantry Primary, Gravesend<br></p> <p><strong>Mario Gribbon</strong> N Ireland, St John The Baptist Primary, Craigavon<br></p> <p><strong>Joanne Lloyd </strong>North, Brandesburton Primary, Driffield<br></p> <p><strong>Darren Neve </strong>South, Grange Community Jnr, Farnborough<br></p> <p><strong>Wendy Reynolds</strong> S Wes, Sampford Peverell CE Primary, Tiverton<br></p> <p><strong>Dawn Shaw </strong>West Mids, Weston Coyney Infant, Stoke On Trent<br></p>",
  "<p><strong>SVEN THE BOAT COMES IN</strong></p> <p>Is the appointment of Sven-Goran Eriksson as England coach, and the worst weather to hit the British Isles since Mad Jock McDoom Fiver was on work experience at the Met Office, by any chance related? Probably not, seeing as Lazio's Swedish coach is not renowned for his meteorological powers. But with the apocalyptic warnings that filled today's back pages - the Sun's John Sadler practically had a stroke - you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise.</p> <p>The FA (CEO: Adam \"Del Boy\" Crozier) this afternoon confirmed that Eriksson will be the new Kelvin Koogan, signing a five-year contract to take full-time responsibility of the side from July 1 2001, with the potential before this date to coach part-time. Crozier, facing a barrage of \"Lord Nelson would be spinning in his grave\"-style questioning, explained that Eriksson would be moving to London, is very excited about working with English players, and, aside from fellow Swede Tord Grip (who will act as his chief scout), will work with the team already in place. \"Sven-Goran Eriksson was the unanimous choice of our selection team\", Crozier said. \"He is one of the best coaches in the world. We're very certain we've made the right choice.\"</p> <p>It's good that the FA are getting their retaliation in first, as Sven is unlikely to have an easy time of it. The players are reported to have preferred an English coach, the fans certainly did, and some pundits would rather see a foreigner take charge of Britain's media outlets (hang on) than England's football team. This fact was not lost on the Swedish press this morning, who observed: \"Welcome to the world's toughest job, Svennis,\" using their pet name for the former Gothenburg boss. \"Even if there are bigger tasks in the world of football,\" wrote columnist Mats Olsson in the daily Expressen, \"there's nothing that's so prestigious, charged, important and probably so wonderful as being in charge of England.\" Which is probably the best use of \"probably\" for some time.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>DANE DEAL DONE</strong></p> <p>Danish international winger Jesper Gronkjaer was born in Greenland at the height of the summer dog-sled season. So he's a quick lad. But not even he could escape the clutches of Colin Hutchinson, managing director of swanky London boutique Chelsea's of Chelsea. Because today - after a 12-month chase - Hutch finally got his man, signing Gronkjaer from Ajax for an ice-cool \u00a37.8m. Unfortunately for Chelsea fans, the Dane has a slight thigh strain and so won't be arriving until January 1. But despite this problem (Greg Van Rusedski anyone?) there were smiles all round south-west London this morning. </p> <p>\"This is a great move for me,\" a delighted Gronkjaer admitted. \"I was very impressed when I visited Chelsea. I spoke with Claudio Ranieri for two hours and liked what he had told me. I am looking forward to working with him and playing with some of Europe's top players.\" And Dennis Wise too, we wager. Meanwhile, Hutch was also in a happy mood, and quickly allayed fears that Gronkjaer's injury was serious. \"Because of Euro 2000, Jesper only had one week of holiday this summer,\" he claimed. \"The present minor injury needs rest.\"</p> <p>So come January, what type of player will Chelsea be getting for their money? Well, Barcelona wanted him, as did the big clubs in Italy, especially after his performances in Euro 2000, where he averaged 12 dribbles per game - more than any other player. And if that isn't impressive enough, Gronkjaer's favourite film is The Fugitive, and his plans for life outside football include working in a bank. In fact, there's only one potential problem with Chelsea's new golden boy: Gronkjaer is often compared with the Laudrup brothers - and we all know what brother Brian did after just a few weeks at the Bridge.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"We have to make the game more of a show. An idea would be to have a longer half-time and put on a show. It does not have to be music, but it is important that there is something else for the fans\" - Graham Taylor finally acknowledges what Watford supporters have known for years.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE WHIRLPOOL FROM LIVERPOOL</strong></p> <p>You can always gauge Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier's mood by looking into his eyes. For example, after a comfortable away win, his glassy orbs turn gently. But if Liverpool have been beaten at home, they begin to pick up speed alarmingly. So when they set off on a variable spin speed cycle with rinse hold and reverse tumble for an unbeatable wash performance - like they did this morning - you know something's seriously wrong.</p> <p>The out-of-control optical oscillations began when Titi Camara, upset at being left out of the first team all season, handed in a transfer request last weekend. Since Camara had been unavailable for selection until the middle of October due to injury and international duty, Houllier thought this strange. \"I can't accept that someone who has been available to this club for only ten days, during which time we played three games and won all three, wants to leave because he is not in the team,\" he reasoned pro-logically. \"It disappoints me for the fans and I don't think its being fair on the club.\"</p> <p>It soon became clear that Houllier had embarked not on an economy programme but an intensive one (with pre-iron settings). Questioning the commitment of Camara - who scored for Liverpool on the day his father died - he continued: \"He is the only player I know who has got injured without playing. The injury was so bad that he could only come back seven weeks later. I don't know what kind of injury he had.\" All this suggests Titi's time at Anfield is at an end, but as previous suitors Manchester City, Bradford and Celtic are no longer interested, he could soon be off back to France. Whatever happens, though, the Fiver hopes this will be the last time either Gerard or Titi airs their dirty laundry in public.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Leeds have again been linked with a move for Croatia Zagreb midfielder Zoran Pavlovic. The player's agent is reported to have met David O'Leary on Monday night.</p> <p>Jardel is set to join Benfica for \u00a320m this week, only six months after leaving Portugal for Turkish champions Galatastaray.</p> <p>Disgraced Christoph Daum could be set for a swift return to international management, as coach of Iran.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Tony Cottee's contract at Norwich has been terminated by mutual consent, after the striker decided against relocating his family to Norfolk. \"Tony originally joined us with a view to coaching as well as playing,\" explained Bryan Hamilton. \"He had initially decided to relocate to Norwich but after careful consideration decided that he did not want to uproot his family. There is no way that Tony could travel, play and coach.\"</p> <p>Brazil's former national coach Wanderley Luxemburgo has admitted to faking his age. A police spokesman said Luxemburgo had confessed that he was born in 1952 and not 1955 as stated on his birth certificate. Luxemburgo told police that his father had obtained the birth certificate in 1967 when he was an apprentice with the Rio de Janeiro club Botafogo - to allow him to jump down an age group at the club.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO</strong></p> <p>ITV (various regions): Regional Sports Specials (11.30pm) Worthington Cup highlights, depending on whether your local station can be arsed.</p> <p>Football Extra (2.45am) They're all showing this, though.</p> <p>Sky Sports 1: Inside Scottish Football (6.30pm, 2am) \"There's not a team like the Glasgow Rangers, no not one, and there never shall be one,\" they sing.

  "<p>The worst storm for a decade, which caused road and rail chaos across the country, killed six people, and left hundreds of millions of pounds worth of damage in its wake, last night prompted warnings that Britain is now beginning to pay the price of unchecked global warming. </p> <p>Torrential rain and winds up to 90mph uprooted trees, blocked roads, and cut electricity supplies across southern England and Wales. </p> <p>A tornado ripped through a caravan park in Selsey in West Sussex less than 48 hours after a similar twister devastated parts of Bognor Regis, and thousands of people were stranded mid-channel unable to dock in Dover. </p> <p>Last night a tanker began leaking chemicals into the English Channel after it was overcome by high seas. The 14-strong crew of the Italian ship Ievoli Sun was airlifted to safety. </p> <p>Shops, banks and schools were closed as people failed to get to work, and the Environment Agency issued 25 severe flood warnings across Wales, south-east and south-west England. Dozens of rivers broke their banks flooding hundreds of homes, and lifeboats were rescuing stranded people 30 miles inland. In Yorkshire, the first blizzards of the winter coincided with flash floods. </p> <p>The severe weather followed record rainfall in south-east England in October and an exceptionally wet September. It is exactly the recipe for disastrous flooding predicted by scientists two years ago when looking at the potential effects of global warming on Britain. </p> <p>Yesterday Marilyn McKenzie Hedger, head of the UK Climate Impacts Programme based at Oxford, said: \"These events should be a wake-up call to everyone to discover how we are going to cope with climate change. </p> <p>\"We have had a 0.6C rise in average temperature in the last century, and extreme events have started to happen with greater frequency. How are we going to cope when it goes up 2C?\" </p> <p>The government, alarmed at the increase in flooding of property, is expected to issue an order before Christmas banning new building on flood plains. Even before yesterday's events there had been 30 serious instances of flooding of property in the last two years. </p> <p>The Met Office said that October's rainfall in East Sussex, one of the driest parts of the country, had been nearly three times normal at 226 millimetres (9 inches). </p> <p>There had also been a number of unusual and record breaking \"weather events\" this year - for example an exceptionally warm winter and the wettest April since records began in 1766 - but this still did not mean global warming was here, it said. \"It is the sort of weather we can come to expect, but we cannot know until this pattern is constantly repeated.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the Environment Agency said it could not wait to find out: \"We want a very strong presumption against building on flood plains. But if it goes ahead, in exceptional circumstances, the developer not the public purse should be responsible for the flood defence - and that should not simply be building walls to shift the problem further downstream.\" </p> <p>The government has also al tered regulations so that high-rise structures can withstand stronger winds. Flood defences round the coast are now built to withstand rises in sea level rise and tidal surges, but in some areas low-value farmland is being abandoned because the cost is prohibitive. </p> <p>In two weeks, governments of the world meet in the Hague to try to reach agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the developed countries by an average of 5%, although scientists say 60% reductions are required to keep the climate stable. </p> <p>With more global warming inevitable because of the extra carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere the EU is launching a report tomorrow on how it proposes Europe should adapt. It says that Britain and the rest of northern Europe can expect far more flooding and will give East Sussex and the recent devastation in the Italian Alps as examples. </p> <p>Michael Meacher, the environment minister, writing in today's Guardian, says \"It would be foolish to pretend that every time extreme weather conditions occur, it is due to global warming. But the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme climate phenomena suggest that although global warming is certainly not the sole cause, it is very likely to be a major contributory factor. </p> <p>\"Climate change is not some trendy intellectual scenario for the distant future. It is with us now. It is therefore all the more remarkable that, during the recent fuel crisis, hardly anyone mentioned the environment.\" </p> <p>Calling for the use of alternative fuels to be accelerated, Mr Meacher adds: \"Across the world, millions face drought, flooding and disease. </p> <p>\"Here in the UK we too face threats - the prospect of exotic diseases becoming commonplace, of floods in some years, droughts in others, of low-lying areas being swallowed by the sea. But we have the opportunity to start tackling the impending crisis now.\" </p> <p>The evidence of climate change is building all the time. British birds nest on average two weeks earlier than 30 years ago, insect species, including bees and termites, which need warmer weather to survive, are moving north. Some have already crossed the Channel from France. </p> <p>It is now warm enough for malaria mosquitoes to breed in Sussex. </p> <p>Glaciers in Europe are in retreat, particularly in the Alps, and Iceland, and even the North Pole was ice-free for part of this summer.</p>",
  "As North Korea and the US move to establish an unprecedented new relationship, China has quietly decided that it is time to abandon the fiction that South Korea started the Korean War. <p>No longer will Beijing repeat the official Pyongyang line that South Korea \"invaded the North\" on June 25, 1950. Neither, of course, will it subscribe publicly to the usual Western version in which it was the North which \"invaded the South\". </p> <p>Instead the Chinese media - including those that belong to the People's Liberation Army - offer a more sophisticated view, which avoids the question of who crossed the 38th parallel first altogether. </p> <p>The Korean War, it says, was essentially a civil war between North and South, which had been artificially divided five years earlier when US and Russian forces divided the country. </p> <p>Interestingly, this analysis has long been argued by some thoughtful western scholars who say that the conventional view of the war as a \"communist plot\" overlooks the domestic elements of conflict between two rival regimes and social systems. </p> <p>Though hardly noticed at the time, Madeleine Albright's recent visit to Pyongyang coincided exactly with the 50th anniversary of China's intervention in the Korean War. </p> <p>On October 24, 1950, Pyongyang was occupied by US General Walton Walker who set up his headquarters in the building abandoned by North Korean leader Kim Il-sung. China dates its intervention to the next day when significant numbers of \"volunteers\" crossed the Yalu river and headed south. </p> <p>Only days before, the US supreme commander General Douglas MacArthur had assured President Truman that the war was over and shrugged off the risk of a Chinese intervention. Having repelled the Northern offensive, General MacArthur insisted on pressing on to the Chinese border. </p> <p>The Chinese defence minister Chi Haotian was already in Pyongyang when Ms Albright arrived there. But the delegate of North Korea's most bitter enemy gained more attention than the representative of its oldest communist ally. </p> <p>Reporting the two visits, the Pyongyang-sponsored People's Korea gave almost all its front page to Ms Albright while General Chi had a small box at the bottom. </p> <p>While the North Korean press barely mentions the Chinese intervention, the Chinese media has greeted the 50th anniversary with special supplements describing the intervention of its \"people's volunteers\" as a selfless war against \"US hegemonism.\" Newspapers have carried vivid tales from surviving veterans of a struggle with rifles and grenades against American tanks. </p> <p>A few dissident suggestions that Mao Zedong set back the Chinese post-war recovery by intervening in Korea have been suppressed. However the origin of the war is explained in different language from the past: </p> <p>The website of the Liberation Army Daily poses the question \"how did the Korean civil war break out?\" and answers it in these terms: \"(After 1945) the situation on the Korean peninsula was one of two antagonistic governments each with its own sphere of rule. Thereafter, a fierce struggle broke out between them on how to achieve unification. From January 1949 to June 1950, there occurred more than 2,000 incidents of North-South conflict on the 38th parallel. These armed clashes grew in intensity until full-scale warfare broke out on June 25, 1950.\" </p> <p>This view of the Korean war as a civil war implies that the North's crossing of the parallel on June 25 was less important than the tit-for-tat raids and incursions leading up to it - many of which were launched by the South. It also shifts responsibility for the crisis from the Korean people to the US and Soviet superpowers of the time. </p> <p>Intriguingly, there is some evidence that this more sophisticated approach is shared by the current North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il, son of the late Kim Il-sung who led his country through the war. </p> <p>At a meeting in August this year with South Korean media chiefs, Mr Kim acknowledged that \"both Koreas had problems in their attitudes\" in the past. Each had exploited the slogan of unification \"for the purpose of maintaining their ruling system.\" </p> <p>He avoided blaming the South for the start of the war. Instead he described the post-war division of Korea \"a cut-throat competition (by the world powers) to take the lion's share of the Korean peninsula.\" <br> <b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:john.gittings@theguardian.com\">john.gittings@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/korea/0,2759,331519,00.html\">Korea</a><br><b>Other articles:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28john+gittings%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=john+gittings&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by John Gittings</a></p> <p> <b>Useful links:</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.korea-np.co.jp/pk/\" target=\"_new\">People's Korea</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pladaily.com.cn\" target=\"_new\">Liberation Army Daily</a><br><a href=\"http://www.peopledaily.com.cn/english/\" target=\"_new\">People's Daily</a><br></p> <p>See also Bruce Cumings' book The Origins of the Korean War (Princeton University Press). <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501401391,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Buy it at Bol</a></p>",
  "The restaurant opposite our flat, the \"Pizzeria Venezia\" down the road, the petrol station on the corner and the towing firm which dragged my illicitly-parked car away when we first moved in, all have one thing in common. They are run by Arab Americans. <p>In fact, Arab culture is so deeply embedded in Washington it is hardly noticeable any more. The lyrical sound of the language folds into the background noise of a Washington street corner. It is just part of the urban mix.</p> <p>Until now, this anonymity has suited the Arab American population well enough. It grew anxious after every skirmish with Iraq or after any terrorist bombing in the Middle East, braced for guilt by association. </p> <p>This year, however, is different. They have found a new more assertive voice, more or less by accident. It just so happens that in a few of the most keenly contested swing states in this election, Arab Americans are a sizeable minority. In Michigan, for example, which hangs delicately in the balance, Arab American voters represent 4% of the electorate, and they traditionally vote in higher numbers than their neighbours. </p> <p>It is therefore no coincidence that the community has been courted by both sides, although with much greater success by the Republican contender, George W Bush. </p> <p>In what seemed to be a mere aside in the second presidential debate, the Texas governor mentioned what he termed the \"racial profiling\" of Arab Americans by immigration officials, and the controversial use of secret evidence in the trials of suspected terrorists - who in several recent cases have been of Arabic descent.</p> <p>With those few words, Mr Bush may well have won Michigan. Democrat Al Gore is unpopular anyway among Arab Americans for his fulsome speeches in support of Israel, and, of course, by his choice of an Orthodox Jew, Joe Lieberman as his running mate. </p> <p>Arab American leaders insist that Mr Lieberman's religion is not an issue but they have accused him of divided loyalties, putting Israeli interests above strictly American ones, despite his record of sympathy for Arab American concerns. </p> <p>The Arab world viewed Mr Bush's father as one of the most sympathetic presidents in modern US history. So when Bush junior went out of his way to meet community leaders on one of his first campaign trips to Michigan, he was greeted by a receptive audience. </p> <p>Mr Gore had scheduled a similar meeting on one of his recent campaign stops but it had to be cancelled at the last minute because he had to attend an emergency White House session on escalating events in the Middle East.</p> <p>It was hardly surprising then that the Detroit chapter of the Arab American political action committee endorsed Mr Bush a few days ago. The explosion of violence on the streets of the West Bank and Gaza has only served to sharpen suspicions, and the Clinton administration is no longer seen by Arabs as an honest broker. </p> <p>Arab Americans are also an important block vote in Ohio, another traditionally swing state now leaning towards Mr Bush. But whether or not the community's influence is seen as decisive, its emergence as a coherent interest group may yet prove to be one of the more important outcomes of this election. </p> <p>It is still not nearly as well-organised as its Jewish-American rival, but it has undoubtedly appeared on the radar screen of the national campaign machines. Arab Americans have shrugged off their invisibility and are flexing their new-found political muscle. US foreign policy in the Middle East cannot remain immune to their presence.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:julian.borger@theguardian.com\">julian.borger@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/0,2759,376727,00.html\">US election race</a><br> </p> <p><b>Other articles:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28julian+borger%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=julian+borger&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Julian Borger</a></p> <p><b>Useful links </b><br> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/\" target=\"_new\">The Washington Post</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/pentagon/\" target=\"_new\">The Pentagon</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\" target=\"_new\">The White House</a><a> <br></a><a href=\"http://www.capsteps.com/\" target=\"_new\">Capitol Steps political satire</a><a> <br></a><a href=\"http://AmericanPresident.com/xword.html\" target=\"_new\">Washington crossword</a> <br><a href=\"http://dc.about.com/citiestowns/midlanticus/dc/\" target=\"_new\">Washington DC homepage</a></p>",

  "<p>The final bill for the storms and floods that have lashed southern England is expected to reach \u00a3500m, making it the third worst British disaster on record, in insurance terms, and threatening a steep increase in premiums next year. </p> <p>But with more than a quarter of homes not having adequate contents insurance and because few insurers pay out for damaged fences, the true cost of the clean-up may approach \u00a31bn. </p> <p>Shares in insurance companies dived when the stockmarket opened yesterday, with \u00a3250m wiped off the value of Royal &amp; SunAlliance, Britain's biggest household insurer. </p> <p>Calls to claims departments reached four times their normal levels yesterday morning, but insurers said the damage reported was much less severe than that caused by the hurricane of 1987 or gales of 1990. </p> <p>Eagle Star said: \"We had 700 claims by 11am, but it's not a catastrophe on the scale of 1987 or 1990. The trees that were going to be uprooted and the chimney stacks that were going to fall disappeared then, so the damage now is not so severe.\" </p> <p>Sunday night's gales hit some towns where insurance experts had only just started assessing claims following recent tornadoes. Direct Line - which had taken 2,000 claims calls by midday - said: \"In some areas, such as Bognor Regis, we already had teams in place. We are currently giving telephone authorisation for urgent repairs of up to \u00a31,000.\" </p> <p>The full scale of losses will not be known for several weeks, according to Jeffrey Salmon, managing director of Salmon Assessors, but he estimates that the bill is unlikely to be lower than \u00a3350m. Then he warned that losses would be clawed back in higher premiums next year. </p> <p>\"Premiums went up steeply after 1987 and 1990, and I estimate that they will go up an other 50-60% next year. In some ways the insurers enjoy these big events, because it gets everybody to come to them and allows them to put up premiums. Every time there is a major disaster, the following year the insurers report record profit figures,\" said Mr Salmon, who acts on behalf of individuals whose claims have been denied by insurance companies. </p> <p>However, the Association of British Insurers denied that big premium increases are in the pipeline. \"A big storm in itself will not be sufficient to force premiums up,\" said a spokesman. </p> <p>The average buildings insurance premium in Britain is \u00a3160, with contents insurance adding a further \u00a388, says the ABI. A 60% increase would add around \u00a3150 to the bill. </p> <p>Premiums have remained fairly steady over the past three years, partly because wetter weather has reduced subsidence claims, which cost insurers more than storm damage.

  "Destinies can be shaped in unlikely ways. The chain of events that led 24-year-old Vivek Bhardowaj to a converted factory in east Berlin is more ironic than most. As he was studying for his finals at the Punjab Technical University earlier this year, a politician 4,000 miles away in the Rhineland was looking for a way to boost his regional election campaign. J\u00fcrgen R\u00fcttgers of the Christian Democrat Union attacked the centre-left German government's plan to import up to 20,000 computer experts from the developing world. Germany, he said, needed better education, not more immigrants. Someone with an ear for a rhyme summed up his approach as Kinder statt Inder (Children not Indians). <p>A Berlin start-up, Datango, which was opening a jobs page on its website, seized on the controversy with its own jokey slogan: Sind Sie Inder ? (Are you an Indian?). A T-shirt with the slogan and the web address of Datango's jobs page appeared at an IT exhibition and up in the pages of the Times of India. Datango received 130 applications, one from Mr Bhardowaj. </p> <p>The arrival in Germany of Mr Bhardowaj and thousands like him has sparked an explosive debate that touches on labour needs, educational failure and race. </p> <p> <b> Tighter controls</b><br> The Christian Democrats are debating whether to follow Mr R\u00fcttgers' lead and make an anti-immigration stance the focus of their 2002 general election campaign. Yesterday two conservative parliamentary leaders vowed to follow his example and press ahead with plans to seek tighter immigration controls, despite warnings that they are playing with fire. </p> <p>Fredrich Merz and Michael Glos said there was widespread concern about uncontrolled immigration. </p> <p>\"It's not an issue that is being artificially whipped up for an election campaign,\" said Mr Glos, parliamentary floor leader of the Bavarian Christian Social Union. \"It's a topic that the public is concerned about and it has to be resolved. Declaring it taboo is the same as saying, 'The public is too dumb for this.'\" </p> <p>The launch of the scheme that attracted Mr Bhardowaj to Germany has made the choice more difficult than it would have been a few months ago: it has inverted the terms of a debate in which the right have traditionally enjoyed a natural advantage. </p> <p>\"In the past we always discussed immigration in terms of how we could avoid bringing people into Germany,\" Thomas Mickeleit, spokesman for IBM Deutschland, said. \"Now, we're talking about the opposite.\" </p> <p>His own company's support for the scheme highlights another important novelty: that in this debate the right cannot count on support from its natural allies in business. Indeed, the government's plan grew out of a dinner for IT company bosses in February given by the chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. </p> <p>It lets computer experts live and work in Germany for up to five years provided they have either a university degree or the offer of a job paying more than DM100,000 (about \u00a330,000) a year. The press dubbed it the \"green card\" scheme. </p> <p>Hans Mader, the official in charge, said that in its first 10 weeks of operation, 2,261 people had been placed: to some a disappointing result. But, Mr Mickeleit, said, scheme and the debate should not be confused. \"The number of Germans applying for courses in engineering sciences and IT has doubled since it began. It has become obvious to the public that there is a gap in their economy.\" </p> <p>But behind the green card plan looms the question of whether Germany, like other European states, needs to import not thousands but millions of workers. Could Germany cope without an outburst of xenophobic resentment? </p> <p>Mr Bhardowaj's first impression of Berlin was overwhelmingly positive. But he has been in Germany only a short time. </p> <p>Jarnail and Ramona Singh have different experiences to recount. They, too, live in Berlin, having fled from the eastern town of Meerane, where they ran a restaurant. </p> <p>On September 30, after a dispute with their neighbours, their premises were stormed by a howling drunken mob. </p> <p>Racism and racist violence are scarcely unique to Germany, but there are several reasons why Germany is likely to find the transition to a multi-ethnic society more difficult than other western European countries. </p> <p>For a start, it now includes the formerly communist east - a region in which, until just 10 years ago, the imposition of socialism was held to have obviated the need for a thorough reckoning with the racist past. </p> <p>While the level of racial violence in the west is comparable with that elsewhere in western Europe, in eastern Germany it is four times the level of that in Britain, according to conservative official estimates. </p> <p>In Germany there is an exceptionally close link in the public mind between nationality and ethnicity. Only this year have those born in Germany gained the automatic right to become Germans if their parents were born elsewhere. To most other Germans the 7m who belong to ethnic minorities are Ausl\u00e4nder (foreigners). </p> <p>For decades the main parties insisted that Germany was \"not a country of immigration\". The foreigners who arrived as cheap labour were not immigrants but Gastarbeiter (guest workers). And, like guests, they were expected to leave when no longer welcome. </p> <p>Several consequences flowed from this fundamental self-delusion. One was that when immigration rose again in the 80s it was dealt with not by a modern immigration act but by bending the asylum laws. </p> <p> <b> Just like apartheid</b><br> As Mr Schr\u00f6der and the captains of hi-tech industries sat down to their dinner, Christopher Nsoh was drafting an open letter to highlight the grievances of asylum seekers. </p> <p>\"We cannot work. We cannot study. And we cannot travel,\" Mr Nsoh, a lawyer from Cameroon who lives in a hostel in the eastern town of Rathenow, explained. \"If we want to go more than 60 miles outside the boundaries of our Landkreis [borough] then we need permission from the immigration officer. It is just like South Africa before the fall of apartheid.\" </p> <p>To add to their problems, asylum seekers are favourite targets for neo-Nazi skinheads. \"I've tried going out at night three times in Rathenow and I've been assaulted each time,\" Mr Nsoh said. \"[It is] racism on the streets, racism in the institutions and racism in the law.\" </p> <p>The green card initiative has undoubtedly helped to change perceptions. It has made the point that immigrants are a boon, not a burden. At the same time it is helping to sustain the old myth that one day, if circumstances change, the foreigners may all go home and leave Germany to the Germans. The green cardholders, with their five-year work permits, are ultimately modern hi-tech guest workers.</p>",
  "Mexican police have arrested a Cuban man in connection with the disappearance of a British woman who is believed to have been abducted on a backpacking holiday. <p>Brenda Searle, 27, who was travelling alone and speaks little Spanish, has been missing since September 4 when she failed to meet her boyfriend at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, the site of a Mayan temple, in the state of Yucatan. </p> <p>Ms Searle flew to Cancun, the main resort on the Yucatan peninsula, on August 31 from Amsterdam where she was working as an account executive for an internet company. She planned to spend a fortnight in Mexico with Andre van de Vooren, her boyfriend, who was working there as a tourist guide. </p> <p>From Cancun, Ms Searle travelled by bus and ferry to Isla Mujeres - an island popular with backpackers - and stayed in a budget hotel. </p> <p>In an email sent to her family from the island, Ms Searle said that she was leaving the next day and had booked a room at a hotel near the Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 site. It was the last time her parents heard from her. </p> <p>The following day Ms Searle's credit and bank cards, which she carried in a money belt, were used to withdraw \u00a3270 from an automatic teller machine. On September 8, \u00a3800 was charged to her credit card. </p> <p>After she failed to arrive at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Mr Van de Vooren spent a fortnight searching for her. </p> <p>Mexican police have arrested a Cuban man in the neighbouring state of Campeche on charges relating to assaults and rape on other women last month. </p> <p>Ariel Arjona, director of Quintana Roo judicial police, said the force had \"strong suspicions\" that the man has links to Ms Searle's disappearance, but refused to identify him. He has been taken to Chetumal in the state of Quintana Roo by the police. </p> <p>Police, who are working with the British consul in Cancun, have traced a telephone call Ms Searle made to Mr Van de Vooren's hotel - Hotel Lopez - in a village just outside the ruins on the evening of September 4. </p> <p>A receptionist said the conversation was difficult due to language barriers. The call was transferred to Mr Van de Vooren's room but he was out and the message was not passed on. </p> <p>Ms Searle's father, Geoffrey, is English and her mother is Dutch; the family moved to the Netherlands when she was 11. They now live near Arnhem. Ms Searle has a British passport and returned to England in the early 90s to study for a biochemistry degree at Imperial college in London. </p> <p>Ms Searle's mother, Marjo, who recently returned from a three-week search for her daughter, said she was a very experienced traveller. </p> <p>\"She has travelled to Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, Brazil and South Africa on her own,\" she said. \"We thought this trip was nothing to worry about - just a short break with her boyfriend who'd been living in Mexico and spoke Spanish. </p> <p>\"Looking back, we should have been more worried, but she's so organised and intelligent and has always looked after herself. We don't know which direction to search anymore. We need more facts to be able to continue.\" </p> <p>The Searles hired three Mexican private investigators for the first week of the search in the hope of uncovering their daughter's whereabouts, but to no avail. </p> <p>The family is yet to know if another search by two of Ms Searle's closest friends, who were due to return to Britain from Mexico yesterday, has been fruitful. Charlotte Holgate and Lisa Eastwood, from Sussex, were fellow students of Ms Searle's at Imperial college. </p> <p>Three Mexican state police departments are investigating the disappearance. They are liaising with Dutch police and Britain's Foreign Office. </p> <p>A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \"It's a difficult time for the family. The investigation continues.\" </p> <p>Juliette Quaedvlieg, a friend of Ms Searle's and owner of the company where she works, said: \"Brenda is very smart. It's not a case of a naive thing not knowing what she was doing. </p> <p>\"She'd always carry a wallet with false credit cards in case she was robbed and kept the real thing hidden. </p> <p>\"She was brilliant. I don't know anyone more confident and capable.\" </p> <p>Concern about the safety of female backpackers travelling alone was raised in August after Kirsty Jones, 23, from Brecon, Wales, was found raped and murdered in her room in a hostel in Chiang Mai, northern Thailand. </p> <p>The company where Ms Searle worked, ab.fab Interactive Media Group, has created a web page, <a href=\"http://www.abfab.\" target=\"_NEW\">www.abfab.</a> nl/brenda, appealing for information about her disappearance.</p>",
  "Tony Blair held talks with his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, last night as the two governments intensified their efforts to save the Northern Ireland peace process from collapse. <p>With republicans and unionists trading bitter recriminations in Belfast, the two prime ministers spoke of their determination to shore up the Good Friday agreement. </p> <p>Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary, who will hold talks this week with the Irish foreign minister, Brian Cowen, attempted to focus minds. Speaking in Omagh, he said: \"If we lose it, there will be no replacement, no second chance, no coming back. It is now or never for this agreement and that's why people have really got to devote themselves to making it work.\" </p> <p>There were no signs of common ground, however, after David Trimble, first minister and leader of the Ulster Unionists, unveiled plans at the weekend to block Sinn Fein's two ministers from attending meetings of a cross-border ministerial council. His move was designed to punish Sinn Fein for the IRA's \"failure\" to disarm. </p> <p>Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's education minister, called for an emergency meeting of the Northern Ireland power-sharing executive as he pledged to attend meetings of the north-south ministerial council. \"It is hurtful to me to be told two days after an executive meeting that you do not count,\" he said. </p> <p>Sir Reg Empey, the Ulster Unionists' enterprise minister, said that republicans had created the crisis. \"The unionist community is turning against this agreement because it has not been implemented fairly,\" he said. </p> <p>With no sign of an end to the recriminations in Belfast, all sides agree that it is up to the British and Irish governments to rescue the peace process. Mr McGuinness underlined the expectations when he said: \"We want to hear how they are going to face down those people who want to drag us back to the bad old days.\" </p> <p>The London-Dublin axis has proved to be a crucial element in nursing the peace process through repeated crises. However, relations between the two governments have deteriorated over the past year. </p> <p>Mr Blair and Mr Ahern, who spoke for 30 minutes last night on the telephone, still enjoy warm relations. But lower down the chain, where the day-to-day Anglo-Irish work is carried out, relations are frosty. </p> <p>Officials say it is an open secret that Mr Mandelson and Mr Cowen do not get on. A leaked Northern Ireland Office memo, which is said to have reflected the thinking of Mr Mandelson, accused Mr Cowen earlier this year of attempting to strip the province of its British identity. </p> <p>Their relations are unlikely to get any warmer when Mr Mandelson suggests to Mr Cowen that the international disarmament commission should play a more active role. Irish officials are wary of compromising the independence of the commission. </p> <p>Relations have turned sour principally because Dublin believes that Mr Mandelson has moved too far towards unionists in implementing the Patten report on policing. Irish officials are angry that the legislation enacting the reforms keeps alive memories of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. </p> <p>British sources insist that Mr Mandelson has gone out of his way to \"strike the balance which was at the heart of Patten\". This has involved radical changes - including a new name - while making clear that the RUC is not being disbanded.</p>",
  "<b> Tony Cascarino? Country singer? Had a band called Dawn? </b> No, that's Tony Orlando. <p> <b> So who is this Cascarino? </b> A footballer. </p> <p> <b> Italian? </b> No, he played 88 times in the green jersey of Ireland. </p> <p> <b> Sounds about as Irish as that McAfferty's fun pub on the high street. </b> You might have something there. Even his former national team manager, Jack Charlton, used to refer to him as the ice-cream salesman. </p> <p> <b> Let's get this settled, where does Tony come from? </b> Born in Kent, Italian father, English mother. Used to be a hairdresser. </p> <p> <b> So why was he playing for Ireland? </b> Under Charlton, the Irish became cunning in exploiting players' family trees. Tony thought he qualified because his paternal grandfather, Michael O'Malley, was Irish. </p> <p> <b> Was he? </b> Well yes and no. O'Malley was Irish but wasn't his granddad. The old boy confessed all on his deathbed. </p> <p> <b> And Tony immediately told the relevant authorities? </b> He didn't know. Although his mother was aware that her son was playing under false pretences she didn't pass on the information until he had retired from the international game. </p> <p> <b> So Tony was the innocent party? </b> Not exactly. The Irish embassy in London, a bit sharper on the rules than their footballing authorities, refused to issue him with citizenship. He played for the Irish for 12 years on a British passport. \"I was a fraud,\" he says, \"a fake Irishman.\" </p> <p> <b> And how has the story finally come to light? </b> Unlike the man he thought was his granddad, Tony hasn't waited until the metaphorical final whistle to confess. It's all in his new autobiography, Full Time: the Secret Life of Tony Cascarino. </p> <p> <b> Ah, he's got a book to sell. </b> Yeah, but it's a lot more interesting than David Beckham's. </p> <p> <b> Why, whose knickers was he wearing when he played for Ireland? </b> Oh do shut up. </p> <p> <b> Do say: </b> \"Any chance of a signed copy, Tone?\" </p> <p> <b> Don't say: </b> \"Loved the way you sang Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree.\"</p>",
