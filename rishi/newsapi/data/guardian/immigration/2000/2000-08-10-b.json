  "<p>Straight into the college foyer on Monday morning, and I see the first asylum seeker of the week at the reception desk, looking Middle Eastern and tired. \"I need English. English class where?\" Reluctantly I declare myself. \"I teach English. Can I help you?\"</p> <p>The answer is that I can't. We have no more spaces in any of our classes for English as a second language (ESOL) in Newcastle. We have a file bulging with names and addresses of desperate refugees. We are no longer enrolling students, and I should tell him to come back in three months' time when our next sessions start.</p> <p>But I can't face the disappointment in his eyes. So we go upstairs and I ask him to write down his name and address and promise to get in touch if there are any spaces. \"But please you give me class soon,\" he begs. \"I come back again tomorrow.\" </p> <p>\"No, not tomorrow. Wait until we write to you,\" and I mimic the act of writing with an imaginary pencil in the air. </p> <p>\"I at home all day,\" he says. \"Do nothing. Need English. Need class.\"</p> <p>He starts to follow me into the staff-room to plead his case, and colleagues look up wearily. I manage to get rid of him at last, after marking his name with an asterisk and the words \"very keen\".</p> <p>We date all entries and try to offer places on a first-come, first-served basis, but many names have special pleas for clemency attached, and when we trawl the files we try to take these into account. We also have to work out whether to offer several classes to a few students, thereby enabling them to learn English more quickly, or one class a week to many students. We eventually decide to send notes round to all the ESOL staff again, asking them to look at their class lists and see if they can squeeze in a few extras.</p> <p>The week continues in the same pattern, the normal demands of teaching and administration being punctuated by the extra requests of the new arrivals in the corridors.</p> <p>We started our classes and filled them in last September, but huge numbers of asylum seekers began to arrive without warning in the middle of winter. We have laid on as many extra classes as we can without notice, but we are stretched to breaking point, as are other nearby colleges and ESOL centres.</p> <p>We have taken on new staff, thus increasing the overcrowding in our squalid staffroom. We are even busing students twice a day to a nearby campus where new IT facilities are proving a boon to the new refugee students. (Many with a smattering of English and an interest in computing have enrolled on a Start IT course while awaiting the holy grail of ESOL.)</p> <p>Meanwhile our role in the college extends far beyond that of mere teaching. We are worried about the students' living conditions. Some came to us from a hostel where there was no hot water for a week. They smelt so bad that teachers on enrolment duty were gagging as they filled in the forms. Others are suffering from the bad diets forced on them in these hostels, or from the fact that they have been housed out of town, but are not being given their bus fare to attend college. </p> <p>We find ourselves phoning social services to plead for students to be rehoused, as they have been placed in unsuitable accommodation without local consultation. Other teachers are phoning the churches to find out about second-hand clothing and furniture for our students. We have to deal with mental health problems too. Many asylum seekers are traumatised and deeply unhappy. A few are aggressive.</p> <p>We have always taken pride in our ESOL department, seeing ourselves as a happy and successful part of the college, efficiently led by a section leader who is professional and compassionate, and with classes of satisfied and hard-working students. </p> <p>Now we find ourselves exhausted, demoralised and embarrassed at having to turn so many people away. We are haunted by the corridor people, their faces pressed against the glass of our staffroom door. It feels as though we are in a kind of corridor, too, a halfway place between compassion and frustration, and Britain seems to be in a large corridor of its own, not sure whether it is helping asylum seekers or punishing them. </p> <p>One thing seems certain - if we continue to move vast numbers of people around the country to areas of high unemployment without any support systems for them, we are storing up trouble that will explode in a way that lowly further education teachers cannot control.</p> <p>I recently set a class the mundane homework task of designing an information leaflet for public library users. A Kurdish refugee wrote: \"You have to be careful when you choose the book because from those books which you will read, the Iraqi security service will know how do you think. You can find these books are against the Iraqi government but you cannot read them. If you read them, you will go to the prison as soon as possible.\"</p> <p>In a country where we have the luxury of reading the books of our choice, could we not also offer a little more practical help to people from countries where this is not possible?</p> <p>\u0095 Sue Stewart is an ESOL lecturer at Newcastle College, England</p>",
  "<p><strong> King lire</strong><br> </p> <p> One of the happier consequences of the euro would be an end to those mathematical acrobatics required before purchasing so much as a Cornetto abroad. At least if we find all those zeros on price tags bewildering we can rely on the banks to convert them correctly. Or can we? </p> <p>George Wistreich relates how his daughter and son-in-law visited an Italian pizzeria and paid the L100,000 bill by credit card. When their Visa statement arrived, they had been charged \u00a3226 - the equivalent of L700,000. When the couple disputed the amount, the bank obtained a copy of the sales slip from the restaurant. It is, according to Wistreich, of poor quality and scarred with blobs and scratches, but recognisably for the sum of L100,000. However, the couple had not kept their receipt and the bank insists that without it, it cannot dispute sums \"altered\" by merchants. The sum wasn't altered, insists Wistreich, just misread. </p> <p> \u0095 \"They're scuppered,\" concludes a spokesman from the Association for Payment Clearing Services (Apacs). \"The Italian bank will have misread the digits. The UK bank wouldn't have seen the sales slip, although it's unfortunate that it won't do more to help.\" </p> <p>Stuart Cliffe of the Association of Bank and Insurance Customers isn't surprised. \"Banks tend to wave their hands in the air and say there is nothing they can do - we say they are responsible for our money so it's up to them to ensure that the right amount is debited,\" he says. </p> <p>Travellers beware: conversion hiccups are by no means rare, but the arrival of the euro has spawned a new scam. Credit card holders pay for goods in, say, lire, but the trader tells the bank the price was in euros, thereby vastly inflating the value. \"Please, please keep receipts so you can back up any complaints,\" the APCS warns. </p> <p><strong> Good things in packages</strong><br> </p> <p> It's that happy time of year when Consumer readers, worn down by malfunctioning computers, recalcitrant insurers and automated help lines, take themselves off to recover. And return, many of them, with more grievances. Jeff Wells, of London, wonders if there is any future in package holidays when it's so easy - and, he found, cheaper - to book holidays direct. After a week with his family in the French resort of Courchevel, he found that he could have saved \u00a3500 had he booked the transport and accommodation himself instead of through First Choice. Since then he has seen a First Choice brochure for 2001 in which a ski package for three, in Courchevel, comes to \u00a32,925. \"I've been offered the same holiday booked direct from Eurostar and the same hotel for \u00a3650 less, including a taxi from the station. Even if we travel first class and choose full board we save \u00a3207 on First Choice's price for economy travel and half board.\" </p> <p> \u0095 First Choice says that the package Wells highlights is not representative. \"It's one of the most expensive hotels we feature,\" says a spokesman, missing the point. \"I don't believe Mr Wells could come close to matching the prices for our Total Ski Package which start at \u00a3309 and include everything from skiing lessons to drinks.\" </p> <p>The Association of British Travel Agents denies hotly that package deals are a rip off. \"You can always find an exception to the rule that they are cheaper because hotels often do last-minute deals if you book direct,\" says a spokeswoman. \"Tour operators block book so get better deals with airlines. Most important, package travellers are covered by the Package Travel Regulations which give some protection when things go wrong.\" </p> <p><strong> BA ticket trauma</strong><br> </p> <p> Michael Bave, of Epping, has learned the value of the Package Travel Regulations the painful way. His son wanted to take the place of a friend on a \u00a3900 flight to Australia. The travel agent, Lunn-Poly, said he would have to deal direct with British Airways which says it is not policy to amend tickets,although the flight is not until December and no tickets have yet been issued. Instead it offered to cancel the old ticket for \u00a3150 and issue a new one at \u00a31,800. \"None of their documents say that the tickets are non-refundable and non-transferrable,\" says Bave. \"Is this fair?\" </p> <p> \u0095 Had Bave's son booked a package to Australia he would have been covered by section 10 (1) of the 1992 Package Travel Regulations which states that a holiday may be transferred if reasonable notice is given and the new traveller meets all the relevant conditions. But this does not apply to independent passengers. </p> <p>\"Although a name change may sound simple it actually involves cancelling the old booking and making a new one,\" says a BA spokeswoman. \"The cheaper the ticket, the more restrictions there are and the travel agent is supposed to make this clear.\"</p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:consumer@theguardian.com\"> consumer@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "What is it about William \"14-pints-a-day\" Hague's image that causes him so much trouble? Apart from the premature baldness, now resolved by his adoption of a menacing Grant Mitchell crop, his CV should be a spin doctor's dream. A \"normal\" middle-class family background, north of Watford too, a state school education, four As at A-level and straight into Oxford. There he both got a first and was president of the Union, a rare double. Thence into McKinsey's, the cult management consultancy which does not hire fools. <p>Onwards and upwards until, at 36, already an ex-cabinet minister, young William becomes the youngest Tory leader since Pitt (who got the job in 1793 when he was 24). He was a William too, come to think of it, nerdy and a bit of a boozer. As Cecil Parkinson used to say: \"At every stage William's done better than Tony Blair.\" And yet he still seems to get the personal stuff horribly wrong. Even making allowances for the August silly season in Fleet Street, yesterday's tabloids were, surely, a nightmare. </p> <p>\"I was Britain's biggest boozer,\" thundered the Mirror. \"Billy Liar,\" roared the Sun with its usual delicacy. The broadsheets were scarcely kinder. Even the FT managed \"Billy Fizz Hague tries to sink his sober image\" on page three, so that Britain's EU partners, just recovering from Euro 2000's battle of Charleroi, will be sure to see it. </p> <p>In one casual exchange with GQ magazine, Mr Hague had simultaneously annoyed a vast coalition of voters: health fascists joined forces with teetotallers, prigs with sophisticated teenies who know that simply everybody nowadays does drugs (that's why it's called e-commerce) on Saturday nights. All of them combined with anyone who wants to feminise the tone of our still rather masculine public life to denounce him for laddishness, social irresponsibility and a sheer lack of cool. It could be argued that the worst offence was caused to boozers of the old school, who simply didn't believe the claim. At 15 or 55 years old, it's a lot of beer. In Rotherham they claimed to remember that the lad who helped deliver the beer barrels on behalf of his dad's company, wasn't even a half-of-lager lout. </p> <p>Hence the Billy Fizz and Billy Pop jokes. They reinforce what remains the predominant public image of Hague the teenager as a nerd, who made \"that speech\" at the Tory conference in 1977, who read Hansard and kept byelection results, not football results, on his bedroom wall. We have been here before with Mr Hague. Back in 1997, he was photographed in a baseball cap and then drinking through a straw (beer presumably) out of a melon at the Notting Hill carnival. A young, happening-kind-of Tory leader, one who cared, had taken over, was the not-so-subliminal message. </p> <p>Except it didn't work, as Tory strategists came to realise. It wasn't the real Hague and it wasn't the right message after the slaughter of May 1. Hague was already busy remoulding his party well out of public gaze. Once he'd done that and finished apologising for past Tory error, he could start to move on policy reformation. </p> <p>The Hague Mk II who emerged in time for the 1999 European elections (along with the Grant Mitchell look) was harder and meaner. He focused on Tory core issues with wider resonance: the euro, law and order, asylum seekers entering Britain during the Kosovo war, enough to start getting Tony Blair rattled. No more Mr Nice Guy, and some cartoonists started to portray him in an uglier light than the short-trousered kid at Margaret Thatcher's side. Lately he has begun making speeches on education and health - he may tackle green issues soon - but Hague Mk II has been the key to the modest revival of Tory electoral fortunes. It is the Hague who will fight the coming election. </p> <p>What happened on the pages of GQ this week was not another attempt to reposition the leader's image, it was an accident. The interview was given weeks ago on the grounds, familiar enough to Mr Blair's handlers, that GQ is an upmarket lads' mag, the market leader in fact, which reaches thirty-something voters with lots of disposable cash who are too busy playing squash or shopping to read much. </p> <p> The interviewer was not just another hack either. Nicholas Coleridge is a media grandee, MD of the Cond\u00e9 Nast group which owns GQ, the Eton-and-Trinity son of a past chairman of Lloyds. It is a patsy interview; Mr Coleridge has decided Mr Hague is now the plucky underdog, but there is a distinct tone of condecension in the exchanges. This being GQ, there was a lot of detail about where Hague buys his suits (posh West End) and what colour shirts he likes (blue). His feet are size 9 and Ffion has purged his wide-lapel jackets. She buys him daft cufflinks. </p> <p>Fascinating or what? But politicians have to do this nowadays, though Gordon Brown's GQ interview on fashion would be rather short. The Tory leader was given space for a brief message: GQ should vote Tory for a better business climate, national sovereignty and improved public services. </p> <p>GQ played it up (hey, this is August), but the beer story is actually old. Hague has written it himself, as in the Times of November 15 1997: \"When I'd finished each delivery I'd always be given a pint of John Smith's as a reward. . . at five in the evening I'd be feeling pretty light-headed.\" </p> <p>Far more revealing for a modern populist was his inability to name the England football captain. Describing how he first moved in on Ffion Jenkins (one of his civil servants at the time) he also said that after an official dinner \"we went out socially to a bar in London\" - Hague-speak for \"had a drink\". </p> <p>Yet Mr Hague is a clever man, a witty and fluent public speaker who will, I suspect, surprise us all by surviving long enough to become prime minister over Michael Portillo's acquiescent body - one day. Little horrid has been said about Hague that was not said about Ted Heath or - the dumbos - Mrs T. </p> <p>Last night his aides were putting a brave face on the affair. It had helped to shift that stubbornly-held image voters have of him, as a southern public school boy and toff, they explained. A poll on Talk Radio showed 82% of callers more likely to vote for the 14-pint man than less. Sky TV's poll was running neck and neck. Just as adultery is no bar to high office in France, youthful boozing is not an impediment here. </p> <p>All this may be wishful thinking, but the Tories are surely right to argue that when a wimpish media stereotype clashes with a claim to be a 14-pint man it will produce a bang. All politicians reinvent themselves a bit to become more interesting and all, including Tony Blair, get caught out. </p> <p>The sad thing is that in an age of professionalised politics, when they all start so young, few have time to do or become anything interesting before they start polishing those leadership CVs. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:michael.white@theguardian.com\"> michael.white@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p> 'I think Britain is very good at highlighting human-rights issues in other countries, but when it comes to just outside Oxford, everyone gets a little bit squeamish,\" says Kay Adshead, writer of The Bogus Woman. The play, which is being staged at the Edinburgh's Traverse, chronicles the experiences of an African journalist seeking refuge in Britain from atrocity at home. Adshead had been involved in the Campaign to Close Campsfield, the notorious detention centre in Oxfordshire, and makes no bones about views on Britain's attitude to asylum seekers. \"I hope I've written a consciousness-raising piece of work which has the maximum impact,\" she says. \"I didn't want to pretend there was any impartiality about it. I wanted the whole story to be totally subjective. Everybody else is giving their opinions on asylum seekers - you can't open a paper without seeing them - but I wanted this to be my character's point of view.\" </p> <p>The Guardian's Michael Billington has called the play \"a powerful, passionate, committed piece of theatre that, if seen widely enough, might change hearts and minds. The Bogus Woman does seem to be a little pocket of old-style 70s commitment in the otherwise soft environment of the Edinburgh festival. Having cut her teeth as a performer in the 70s, when \"theatre belonged to communities and could be about the things that affected communities\", Adshead finds it \"strange that theatre stopped being like that\". </p> <p>She began writing in the 80s after working in improvised theatre with directors such as Mike Leigh. \"The more devised work I did, and the more I realised that I was using the stuff of my own life, the more I thought: I can do this myself.\" She duly did so, and the result, a proto-Band of Gold prostitution drama, Thatcher's Women, was produced to acclaim by Paines Plough in 1987. </p> <p>In 1996, The Red Room, who are producing The Bogus Woman, teamed up with Adshead to stage her Royal Court-commissioned millennial political epic, Bacillus. Both company and writer believe in theatre as a forum for social debate, but \"even though everyone was saying they wanted a state-of-the-nation play, nobody wanted to stage Bacillus,\" says Adshead. </p> <p>The Bogus Woman began life as a short play in a season of political work at BAC, south London, and Adshead starred in Victoria Wood's Dinnerladies while she developed the work further. </p> <p>She is unequivocal about the climate that produced the government's Asylum and Immigration Act, which all but criminalises the seeking of asylum and stigmatises those who do gain entry. \"It annoys me that we feel we have a monopoly on prosperity,\" she says. \"And anyway, what's wrong with people trying to look for a better life? It doesn't take a great deal of imagination, surely, to get behind that idea. People say we live in a global world only when it suits them but, of course, the very parties most keen on global capitalism get decidedly protectionist when it is people rather than money that is on the move.\" </p> <p>The nameless heroine of Adshead's play is banged up in Campsfield Detention Centre and becomes involved in the protests that led to the trial of the Campsfield Nine, the group of refugees who were accused and acquitted of rioting at the centre in 1997. In researching the play, Adshead got to know one of the nine, who became her primary source for the description of a system that \"treats all these people as miscreants and wrong-doers\". The play is a synthesis of several first-person accounts, \"more shocking than some,\" says Adshead, \"and less shocking than others\". </p> <p>Eager to distinguish her play from documentary, Adshead even wrote the play in verse. But hard facts are never far beneath the surface in a work that vividly dramatises not only the unrest at Campsfield but the thuggish and often racist backlash that followed. The protagonist describes in harrowing terms the centre's \"prison for profit\" regime, whose wardens are \"hired to brutalise in 12-hour shifts at \u00a34 an hour\". </p> <p>If all this leads you to imagine Adshead as some kind of firebrand, you'll have to think again. Her crusade is dignified by the fact that, as she says, \"I'm not a militant or a far-left person.\"On the contrary, she projects the mumsy air of a well-meaning but faintly naive woman who has suddenly discovered something distasteful happening in her own back yard. When she began to research The Bogus Woman, she recalls, \"I was just gobsmacked. I assumed, in my British liberal way, that people were nice to asylum-seekers. I find it really shocking.\" </p> <p>Her conversation deconstructs Britain's treatment of refugees not from an ideological or analytical perspective, as we might expect from a \"political\" writer, but from one of compassion. Poring over Refugee Council records of asylum seekers' plights almost put her off writing the play, she says. \"I've not got a very strong stomach and I found them terribly upsetting. </p> <p>\"I don't think this is a political thing. I think it's a moral and compassionate issue. When people are vulnerable, you give them the benefit of the doubt, until otherwise proved. That's just being kind.\" Far from suggesting political solutions to what the tabloids call Britain's \"deluge\" of illegal immigrants, Adshead reiterates her sense that \"I don't think there are goodies and baddies - I think there are individual cases, and we should look at every case with a clear eye.\" </p> <p>The Bogus Woman is empty of dogma and reveals remorselessly the human consequences of a system of which, Adshead believes, this country should be ashamed. One of the official persecutors in the play intones: \"I would suggest that your whole story - the killing of your family; the rape - is nothing but a pack of well-schemed lies.\" To Adshead, it is the host, and not the visitor, who is guilty of the greatest self-deception.</p> <p>\u0095 The Bogus Woman is at the Traverse till August 13.

  "One of Germany's most influential conservative politicians yesterday called on Germans to have more children as an alternative to taking in more immigrants. <p>Edmund Stoiber, the head of the state government of Bavaria, was breaking with a taboo dating back to the Nazi past which has effectively prevented discussion by the mainstream parties of measures to boost fertility. </p> <p>He said: \"We are having too few children - to a worrying degree, the significance of which is scarcely recognised\". </p> <p>His comments went to the heart of a raging debate in Germany over the linked issues of racist violence, immigration and demographics. They represented the first considered response from the right to claims that Germany has to accept more immigrants if it is to maintain its competitive edge and its welfare system. </p> <p>That view lies at the root of a recently-launched government drive against the racist right. It is based on projections of the effects of Germany's low birth-rate. A UN study last March concluded that, by the middle of the century and without immigration, 32% of Germany's population would be over the age of 60. </p> <p>Mr Stoiber, a possible candidate for the chancellorship in 2002, said immigration could \"mitigate the problem but not solve it\". </p> <p>Though he was careful to stress his support for the crackdown on racist violence, Mr Stoiber told the newspaper Die Welt that the answer to the looming demographic crisis lay with \"psychological and financial support\" for couples who wanted to have children. </p> <p>His remarks are nevertheless bound to stir controversy. Earlier this year, a fellow Christian Democrat was pilloried for standing for election on a platform of \"Children not Indians\" (Kinder nicht Inder), a slogan which precisely reflected the thrust of Mr Stoiber's comments. </p> <p>In Berlin, judges yesterday indicted three young German skinheads for one of the most horrific of recent racist killings. Two 16-year-olds, Frank Miethbauer and Christian Richter, and Enrico Hilprecht, 24, are charged with beating and kicking to death a Mozambican man in a park in the eastern city of Dessau. </p> <p>Alberto Adriano, a 39-year-old abattoir worker, died on June 11. He left a wife and three children. </p> <p>Prosecutors said the defendants had shouted neo-Nazi slogans. \"What do you want here in Germany?\", one was alleged to have yelled before the three beat him to the ground and kicked him in the head. He died three days later. </p> <p>He had come to former East Germany in the 1980s as a contract worker and remained after unification. To rightwing extremists, he would have embodied their contention that immigrant workers are responsible for the high unemployment rate in the east. </p> <p>Figures published on Tuesday showed that while the seasonally adjusted jobless rate for Germany as a whole fell fractionally, the percentage of unemployed in the east rose. At 17.3%, it was more than double the 7.7% in the west. </p> <p>In an age of increasing globalisation, race hate in the east is keeping out foreign investment and expertise, officials say. It also presents a potentially immense challenge when the EU expands to eastern Europe. As members of the union, Poles, Czechs and Hungarians would be free to seek work in Germany. </p> <p>There have been three race killings already this year. In addition to Mr Adriano, two homeless men were kicked to death last month by neo-Nazis on the Baltic coast. </p> <p>Also last month, a bomb thought to have been planted by ultra-rightwingers went off at a D\u00fcsseldorf railway station, injuring nine immigrants, of whom six were Jews. </p> <p>Federal interior ministry officials yesterday held a telephone conference with their counterparts from the 16 German regions to decide on the feasibility of banning the small far right National Democratic party (NPD), which has a large skinhead following. </p> <p>Proposals for a ban have split the government. Otto Schily, the interior minister, has argued that such a move could prove unconstitutional. But it has wide backing among the Greens.</p>",

  "I fully accept that land rights in Zimbabwe are in need of fundamental reform. But it is disappointing to read that the heads of member states of the Southern Africa Development Community have endorsed Robert Mugabe's policies for land reform (Regional leaders rally behind Mugabe, August 8). <p>Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, proposed some while ago that the UN development programme should be responsible for channelling funds available from external donors to compensate commercial farmers whose land was earmarked for redistribution. </p> <p>The UNDP could play a key role in determining who should inherit smallholdings and could help to diversify the crops grown so as to alleviate the loss to the Zimbabwean economy of the tobacco currently grown on large estates. </p> <p> Leaders in southern Africa will run a great risk of social disorder if they condone high-handedness in Zimbabwe.

Next year, the Webbys will be shown live on TV for the first time, sponsors are now falling over themselves to back it and entries for 2001 are pouring in to the offices in South Park, San Francisco. Not for nothing has she been named the Digital Diva by San Francisco's mayor, Willie Brown. </p> <p>\"I hated award shows personally,\" says Schlain. \"It was almost like my conundrum. The challenge I set forth was an award show that I would be interested in watching.\" </p> <p>She duly created an extravaganza \"dedicated to the creative, technical and professional progress of the internet and evolving forms of interactive media\".

This year, 27 were awarded for the best websites covering everything from Activism and Arts through Health, Humour and Kids to Services, Travel and Weird. </p> <p>The judges assembled for each category included David Bowie, Bjork, Francis Ford Coppola, Anita Roddick, Laurie Anderson, Courtney Love, Matt Groening and Jim Clark. Sponsors included everyone from Visa and Intel to Adobe and Netpulse. </p> <p>What distinguishes the Webbys from the other proliferating ceremonies where tearful expressions of gratitude to mothers, agents and directors are obligatory is that acceptance speeches are limited to five words. \"I hated acceptance speeches,\" says Schlain. \"The internet is all about speed and time is such a commodity.\" </p> <p>This has led to many gnomic and eliptical speeches. \"Technical innovation means class war,\" said the Webstalkers when they won this year. \"They said I could only...\" said Mike Loew of the online humour magazine, <a href=\"http://www.onion.com\" target=\"_new\">Onion</a>, as he accepted. </p> <p>Tiffany Schlain is nothing if not a child of the Bay Area. Born in Mill Valley in Marin County across the Golden Gate bridge at the time when everyone from Van Morrison to Rambling Jack Elliot was hanging out in the area, she is also the child of surgeon and writer Leonard Schlain and psychologist Carole Lewis. Her sister is chairwoman of ShoppingtheWorld.com, her brother chief executive officer of <a href=\"http://www.MedicinePlanet.com\" target=\"_new\">MedicinePlanet.com</a> and her husband, Ken Goldberg, is an engineering professor at Berkeley who doubles as a digital artist. Family dinners must be exhausting. </p> <p>\"As a kid, I was fascinated that flicking a switch activated light,\" she said of her first memory of technology. </p> <p>As a teenager she went to the then Soviet Union as part of the People to People Student Ambassador Programme before studying film at Berkeley and working as an independent film-maker. She still makes films, she says, and has made 27 short ones in all. Frederico Fellini is her god and every year she throws a Fellini cocktail party in his honour in her Winnebago at the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. </p> <p>Just as the late George C Scott and Woody Allen hated and shunned the Oscars, so some of the internet achievers see no point in awards either. \"Ugly capitalist sons of bitches,\" was what Jodi.org came up with as their five-worder last year when they won the arts award. The director of the Academy, Maya Draisin, said that another nominee was \"too humble\" to want an award. But those who say \"beware of geeks bearing awards\" seem to be a minority. Schlain thinks that most people do want to be stars: \"Even in tribal cultures, there is a very primal need for attention and approval.\" </p> <p>Religion and Government will be the two new categories for next year. Schlain foresaw potential problems with judging - \"what happens if you have a Catholic, a Jew and an atheist?\" - but was curious as to who might enter. </p> <p>It still seems unlikely that the Pope would be joining the likes of Sandra Bernhard, Bill Gates and Tina Brown who attended this year's ceremony last May at the Masonic Auditorium in San Francisco. </p> <p>Schlain is very keen that entries should become more international. Anyone who thinks they have a chance is asked to contact Webbyawards.com. There were entries from 27 countries this year. Schlain hopes that this will increase and is looking for more judges from other countries: \"The Oscars model is that they have a foreign category which is very wrong. I would rather it was infiltrated in every category.\" </p> <p>Just like winning an Oscar, winning a Webby can change careers. \"We see our role as shining our light on new success,\" said Schlain. \"It's a new version of the American dream.\" </p> <p>This year's personal website winner was Cockybastard.com. Schlain said she was lecturing in Austin when \"this gorgeous man\" walked up to her and said \"I'm going to win a Webby\". She told him that it was a cocky thing to say but win he did. </p> <p>\"He sent me an email last week and said his life had totally changed. Lots of businesses get put on the map if they win. There's such noise out there and a Webby can elevate you because there is no filter right now.\" </p> <p>New York has been trying to lure the Webbys across to the east coast but Schlain, whose offices are in South Park in the SoMa (south of Market) area of the city - also the home of Wired and countless other dot.com enterprises - is committed at present to San Francisco. </p> <p>There have, of course, been clashes between the new and old cultures of the city with fears expressed that the old alternative culture is being driven out by the property prices prompted by the dot.com boom. </p> <p>\"I'm a big believer that change is good. I think that people who try to pretend that this world is not changing are not foolish but naive. Heraclitus. said 'the only thing permanent in the world is change'. I love that expression. That being said, I'm a native and I've watched this city go through many evolutions.\" </p> <p>Heraclitus is only one of many distinguished sources quoted by Schlain. Einstein, Goethe and HG Wells are all referred to reverentially in Webby literature and publicity. </p> <p> Next year's Big Thing for the Webbys? She reckons the services category. \"I haven't been to a grocery store in a year - I use web.van. That has changed the way I live. I have not left the house for anything. I get all my books through Amazon, I get all my music through CD.now and my movies through Cosmo. </p> <p>\"Because I have saved that amount of time, I exist differently and I think those kind of services make people understand on a very palpable, tangible level how it's changing their life. I think this year is going to be the year that the 'awe with the money' part of the industry gives way to the practical ways. The consumers and the internet are going to be woven together.\" </p> <p>In her introduction to this year's Webby awards, Schlain paid tribute to HG Wells's The Time Machine, which she said was \"like the internet today..., bravely twisted assumptions about space, time, chance, order and chaos. Out of chaos, the Webbys attempt order.\" </p> <p>Space, time, chance, order and chaos. Now there's a challenge for church and state. </p> <p>\u0095 Duncan Campbell is the Guardian's Los Angeles correspondent.</p>",
  "<p><strong> It's a snap</strong><br> Olympus is beginning its rollout of new digital cameras with a new medium priced model aimed at home users. </p> <p>The \u00a3469.99 Camedia C-990 Zoom, pictured here, boasts a resolution of 2.11 megapixels, comes with an 8MB SmartMedia card and incorporates QuickTime Movie facilities. Other features include a 1.8inch LCD monitor, a pop-up flash and programmed auto exposure options. Three new models and a printer will go on sale in the autumn. </p> <p><strong> For the record</strong><br> Americans will soon be able to take home a DVD recorder. Later this month Panasonic is to start selling its DMR-E10 DVD-ram video recorder in limited numbers for $3,999. </p> <p>The recorder uses 4.7GB discs to store up to two and half hours of high quality video and is compatible with both PCs and AV equipment. </p> <p>The recorder can download VHS-based video, clean up the image and then store it on the DVD-ram disc. </p> <p>Panasonic expects to start selling the recorder in the UK next year and has plans to launch several other DVD-ram-based products in the next year including a PC drive and a camcorder. </p> <p>Computers featuring a DVD-ram drive are scheduled to go on sale in the US before the end of the year. (AN)</p> <p><strong> Plush Palm </strong><br> Palm Inc this week launched a new palmtop computer for the fashion conscious with \u00a3130 ($149 in the US) to spare. The m100 is black, but can be customised with mobile phone-style snap-on face-plates available in silver mist, blue mist, green mist, pacific blue and ruby pearl for \u00a319 each ($19.95 in the US). This follows a deal, announced in May, for a <a href=\"http://www.claudiaschiffer.com\">Claudia Schiffer edition of the Palm Vx</a>). </p> <p>The m100 has a rounded base and looks a lot like Compaq's iPaq PocketPC palmtop, except that model is silver. Compaq will also take the faceplate route with a new range of Presario PCs and Presario 1400 notebooks that take MyStyle Accent Colour kits. </p> <p>Palm has dominated the market for pen-operated palmtop computers but is under pressure from Handspring, a start-up founded by the original Palm team. Handspring's Visor is already available in a range of colours and has a Springboard expansion slot that the Palm lacks. </p> <p>The m100 is more aggressively priced than earlier Palms. Although the Palm m100 HotSync Cradle - for synchronising data with a personal computer - costs another \u00a328, it is still \u00a320 cheaper than a comparable 2MB Visor with free USB cradle. </p> <p><strong> Read this!</strong><br> Microsoft has introduced a version of its Reader software, familiar from Windows CE 3-based PocketPCs, for desktop PCs.

  "Erson Wenda stands on a ridge above the remote Baliem Valley, gesturing wildly with his arms, tears in his eyes. \"The soldiers came from over there. They took people from my village, tying their hands, and brought them to these holes.\" <p>He bends forward, his hands behind him, re-enacting what happened when 11 of his terrified neighbours were shot and dumped into shallow graves on the ridge. </p> <p>A silent crowd gathers as he continues his story. A tribesman, wearing only a codpiece and feathers in his hair, stamps his spear and utters a deep moan. An old man in soiled shorts steps forward, pointing to bullet wounds in his thigh and foot. </p> <p>Rain suddenly sweeps in across the valley. Everyone scrambles for shelter. The man's words now compete with rain on the tin roof: \"They hacked the bodies before they threw them into the holes.\" </p> <p>For the first time, the full horror of Indonesian rule in Irian Jaya (or West Papua, as Papuans prefer to call it) is emerging. </p> <p>For more than 30 years Jakarta fought a dirty war against the rebel group OPM and anyone thought to sympathise with them. Thousands are thought to have died. </p> <p>Only now are villagers coming forward to have their reports documented by human rights workers in the highland capital of Wamena. </p> <p>\"We're not scared any more. Before, if you as much as mentioned the rebels you'd be killed. People would be terrorised for as much as writing down their name. People were scared to even use the word Papua,\" says Yafet Yelemaken, who is gathering the evidence. </p> <p>Years of repression now fuel an urgent desire for independence. The Baliem Valley is technically still an area of military operations, but suddenly the hated Indonesian military has disappeared. </p> <p>All along the bumpy road that threads through the valley, villagers have set up their own security posts. Groups of men in bare feet and tattered clothes spring to attention as strangers approach. They brandish the ancient weapons of the Dani tribe that dominates this valley: bows and arrows, spears and crude knives. </p> <p>Veteran members of the OPM emerge from the hills, wearing feathered head-dresses, necklaces of giant boar's teeth and enormous gourds over their loins. \"We're not afraid. Not now,\" they insist. </p> <p>In Jayapura the independence movement organised its most forthright challenge yet. Hundreds flooded the city centre last week for the raising of the outlawed Morning Star flag. The only sign of Indonesian authority was a solitary and bemused traffic policeman. </p> <p>Indonesia's President Abdurrahman Wahid has said he will never let Irian Jaya go. Yet in the valley and here in Jayapura it looked too late, as black-clad militiamen, forbidden flags on their breasts, paraded openly. </p> <p>These men policed the port with sticks and knives when a refugee ship arrived from Ambon. At first nobody was allowed ashore. The few eventually permitted to land for medical treatment were escorted, menacingly, by those same militiamen. </p> <p>One pro-Indonesian businessmen was reportedly kidnapped and beaten by militiamen. Chinese shop owners have been threatened. </p> <p>At the local human rights office, long-standing critics of Indonesia's heavy-handed rule were deeply uneasy, drawing parallels with strife-torn Ambon and East Timor. </p> <p>\"This is a time-bomb waiting to explode. I'm afraid it's all going to end in tragedy,\" said Albert Rumbekwan, one activist. And then cryptically: \"Why are we accepting favours from our enemies?\" </p> <p>Among those \"favours\" is cash for the militia, from a disturbing source. The self-proclaimed \"Big Leader\" of the West Papua independence movement, who runs the militia, is 62-year-old Theys Eluay, a tall, imposing man with a shock of white hair. He was once a member of the ruling Golkar party and voted for integration with Indonesia in a dubious 1969 plebiscite of local leaders. For 30 years he kept quiet about Indonesia's human rights abuses. </p> <p>More sinister is his main source of money: Yorris Raweyai, deputy head of an Indonesian youth organisation with close ties to the Indonesian army and ex-President Suharto. </p> <p>Yorris's youth organisation is involved in gambling, prostitution and protection rackets. In the past it was used by the military for the dirty work that they preferred to avoid: Yorris is awaiting trial over an attack in 1996 on the headquarters of Megawati Sukarnoputri, then an opposition leader. </p> <p>Now it is his money funding Eluay, his West Papuan separatist movement and their militia, which claims to be 7,000-strong. </p> <p>\"The people are hungry for freedom, and that seems to matter more to them than the personalities fighting for it,\" says Mr Rumbekwan. </p> <p>More worrying, Mr Rumbekwan's office has received reports of rival \"red and white\" militias, loyal to Jakarta, being trained by the military in other cities. </p> <p>Unlike East Timor, or Ambon, Irian Jaya has rich reserves of minerals and metals. The Grasberg mine, in the mountains of this wild province, has the world's biggest gold deposit. Freeport McMoran, the American firm that runs it, is Indonesia's single biggest taxpayer. </p> <p>Economically, the province is vital to Indonesia. The fear among human rights groups in Jayapura is that some powers in Jakarta want to create conditions to justify a military crackdown or to unleash chaos to undermine President Wahid's dwindling credibility. The parallels with East Timor and Ambon are frightening indeed. The Observer</p>"
