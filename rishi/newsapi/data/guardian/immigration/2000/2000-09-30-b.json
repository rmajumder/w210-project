  "<p>Today, as the London literary festival also known as The Word reaches its conclusion (appropriate congratulations to Peter Florence for masterminding such an impressive popular literary event), I have a confession to make. I cannot stand public readings. Poetry, fine. Prose, no. Given the choice between listening to a contemporary English writer read aloud from his or her novel in a bookshop or theatre or tent, indeed in any one of the myriad venues that have flourished in the past several years, and visiting the dentist, or scrubbing lichen off the front step with an old toothbrush, I would choose the high-speed drill and the old toothbrush every time. </p> <p>I know that so-called 'author appearances' give a lot of pleasure to a lot of people, but speaking for myself I don't want any part of it. I'd rather enjoy a novel on my own, in silence, at home. Why? </p> <p>Well, first of all, in my experience most novelists are not trained to read aloud. Quite often, they are astonishingly bad at it, mumbling and stuttering and fluffing their lines in a self-inflicted public humiliation that's embarrassing to witness. This is hardly surprising. If reading aloud in performance was their chosen means of expressing their creativity, they would be actors or playwrights, not storytellers. Poets, by contrast, are used to reading their work to an audience. </p> <p>Reading aloud is part of the poet's repertoire. The late Ted Hughes was a spellbinding reader of his own work. So is Seamus Heaney. So are most English poets I can think of. The same, alas, cannot be said of their friends the novelists. Then again, where most poetry is peculiarly well-suited to recitation, most chunks of prose fiction are extraordinarily difficult to render interesting in a one-man performance.</p> <p>Surely, you say, don't you want to see your favourite writers in the flesh? Actually, no. From bitter experience, the writers one most admires are a disappointment in person. Writers are best met through their books, so call me misanthropic but I shall stay at home. In fact, in the history of English prose fiction, there is only one writer, an immortal figure of genius, who stands out as an exception to this rule. </p> <p>Charles Dickens was always a phenomenon, and his famous readings were, even by his own phenomenal standards, sensational. This, by the way, is just one of the many pleasures to be derived from Peter Ackroyd's spellbinding theatrical monologue (brilliantly performed by Simon Callow), The Mystery of Charles Dickens.</p> <p>Callow does a fine job impersonating the old wizard, not least because he himself has a kind of Dickensian creative energy and gift for mimicry. Thomas Carlyle, who actually attended one of Dickens's readings at the Hanover rooms in 1863, gives us a clue to the secret of Dickens's performance. The novelist, he writes 'acts better than any Macready in the world; a whole tragic, comic, heroic theatre visible, performing under one hat, and keeping us laughing... the whole night.' Another witness reported that 'his wonderful eyes seemed to have the power of meeting those of every separate individual in the audience.' It was, says Ackroyd, more than a performance. 'It was a kind of spectacle. And it was a kind of haunting.'</p> <p>This hold over his audience at these readings was not achieved casually, a point that contemporary authors who follow in his footsteps might do well to note carefully. He rehearsed some passages as many as 200 times, marking notes on his delivery ('cheerful', 'stern pathos', 'mystery') in the margin of his script. Ackroyd calculates that each reading was the product of at least two months' work. </p> <p>He was a typical Victorian in this, and those who work in the literary press will always stand in awe of the man's superhuman application, his capacity for hard work. As Ackroyd and Callow point out, in the month that Dickens inaugurated his public readings, he was also completing a new novel, editing a magazine - most of which he wrote himself - and travelling incessantly, often travelling from gig to gig on foot, sustained with occasional sips of ice-cold champagne. </p> <p>It's hard to conjure the whirlwind force of Dickens's literary celebrity today. Mix J.K. Rowling with Salman Rushdie, Terry Pratchett and combine that with Mick Jagger or Elton John and you have only an approximation to his place in the minds of the great Victorian reading public. </p> <p>If Dickens were to attend the London literary festival, the organisers would have a sell-out on their hands, and would be advised to take the Albert Hall. There is no one like him at work today. But his influence is scattered throughout English cultural life, from the cadences of a Pinter play to the back-chat of almost any TV sitcom to the music hall riffs of Morecambe and Wise and their successors. </p> <p>When the Booker Prize short list is announced this week, it will come with tape-recorded readings by the lucky short-listed six. If any one of these displays a tenth of Dickens's command of story, language and character they will take the palm - but don't hold your breath.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Guilty Victim - Austria from the Holocaust to Haider</strong><br> Hella Pick<br>IB Tauris \u00a324.50, pp246<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000241230,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Last month's decision by Austria's EU partners to lift the diplomatic sanctions imposed in protest against the presence in government of J\u00f6rg Haider's far-right Freedom Party was greeted in Vienna as a humiliating rebuff to the country's critics. Three 'wise men' appointed by the European Commission concluded that Austria had a better record towards asylum seekers and other immigrants than many of its European neighbours. And they praised the right-wing coalition's commitment to making amends to the Jewish victims of Austria's collaboration with Hitler.</p> <p>In this fair-minded, authoritative book, Austrian-born Hella Pick, former diplomatic editor of the Guardian, disentangles many widely held prejudices and clich\u00e9s about Austria to explain how an otherwise exemplary liberal democracy has fallen victim to a collective amnesia about its past. She pulls no punches in her condemnation of Austria's insistence that it was a victim of Hitler rather than a collaborator in the mass murder of the the Jews, but shows that others colluded in the myth. </p> <p>In 1943, Britain, the US and the Soviet Union declared that Germany's annexation of Austria in 1938 was an occupation, and named Austria as Hitler's 'first victim'. In the 10 years before it was granted full independence, the country became a key battleground in the Cold War. The West had no qualms about recruiting former Nazis as spies, and in their eagerness to bind Austria into the free-market system, were reluctant to antagonise with demands for speedy compensation for Holocaust victims. Pick quotes extensively from Austrian Cabinet minutes to highlight how the government decided to proceed as slowly as possible in returning to Austrian Jews the property that had been stolen from them during the war. </p> <p>From the mid-1960s until the revelations in 1985 about Kurt Waldheim's wartime past, Austria enjoyed the image of a model social democratic state. This image owed much to Bruno Kreisky, the charismatic Social Democratic chancellor who used Austria's neutral status to devise an activist foreign policy that attempted to build diplomatic bridges between east and west and between Israel and the Arab states. Pick makes no secret of her admiration for Kreisky but shows how his complex relationship with his own Jewish background, allied with a streak of political opportunism, prevented him from encouraging his fellow citizens to take a more candid look at their past. </p> <p>It was not until 1991 that Chancellor Franz Vranitzky finally acknowledged the state's responsibility for the participation of Austrians in the Nazi persecution of Jews. By this time, Haider had already started on the path to political success that led his party into government with the conservative People's Party in February. </p> <p>Unlike many of Austria's friends abroad, Pick does not attempt to play down the ugliness of Haider's xenophobic campaigns, and she dismisses as ludicrous his efforts to compare himself with Tony Blair. Much of Haider's success has been due to popular disenchantment with the cosy 'Proporz' system that shares out top jobs in both the public and the private sectors among supporters of the two big parties. </p> <p>In a passage of their report that Viennese officials have preferred to ignore, the European Commission's 'wise men' state that the sanctions against Austria have been effective in raising awareness about the country's past. Pick concludes that the Haider phenomenon may help Austria to complete the process.</p>",
  "<p><strong> A History of Britain</strong><br>Simon Schama<br>BBC Publications \u00a325, pp416<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000323544,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Macaulay once wrote that it was his ambition to 'produce something which shall for a few days supersede the last fashionable novel on the tables of young ladies'. Simon Schama, a Macaulay for the video age, has already achieved this feat with his bestselling history of the French Revolution, Citizens. He has also gone one better than Macaulay with Dead Certainties, a quasi-fiction, and in his spare time he has also been art critic for the New Yorker. In short, he is an ideal host for a BBC television history of Britain in the time of New Labour. </p> <p>Schama revels in a good story. From a historiographical point of view, the result is an uncharacteristically conventional, but still colourful, account that explores the emergence of 'Great Britain' from an Iron Age twilight that Schama shows to have been rather more complex and a good deal less benighted than generally allowed. </p> <p>Underlying everything he writes is a searching consideration of that most urgent and vexed of contemporary political questions: has British history unfolded 'at the edge of the world' or at the heart of it? Here, Schama leaves us in no doubt where his sympathies lie: 'The one thing,' he writes, 'a king of England could not afford was insularity.' He is also topically alert to non-English sensitivities. Describing the Plantagenets' enforced recognition of Irish and Scottish grievances, he notes that: 'It had taken the rest of Britain to remind England how to be a nation.' </p> <p>In his time, Schama has not been afraid to indulge in fundamental revisionism. Not here. Now his iconoclasm is playful and entertaining, for 'young ladies', not fellow professionals. He is, mercifully, no Norman Davies. As he says in his preface, he promises 'not just instruction but pleasure'. I think he succeeds triumphantly, with a well-judged marriage of epigram and aper\u00e7u.</p> <p>So Hadrian's Wall was not a flinty, Pict-busting barricade, but a primitive Romano-British shopping mall. Alfred the Great was a Dark Age Blair, 'half book-worm, half show-off', who picked up most of his ideas about Anglo-Saxon nationhood during a gap year in Rome. The Normans squeaked an away win at Hastings, but made a hash of William's subsequent coronation. Thomas \u00e0 Becket's fateful irritation with Henry II was exacerbated by 'the chafing of his goat's hair underwear'. And so on. </p> <p>In his epigraph, another gobbet from Macaulay, Schama heads off the charge of flippancy with: 'I shall cheerfully bear the reproach of having descended below the dignity of history if I can succeed in placing before the English a true picture of the life of their ancestors.' This is where Schama's interests lie, in describing the texture of the common-or-garden existence of ordinary people, and it's here that his book takes wing. His chapter on the great plagues of medieval Britain, and their impact on high policy and everyday life, is at once terrifying and moving, sympathetic and suggestive. </p> <p>From these sombre pages, Schama makes an easy transition to the cruel majesty of Henry VIII, whose destruction of Anne Boleyn was 'one part pornography, one part paranoia'; to the crazed and bloody religious persecutions of Queen Mary; and finally to the accession of Good Queen Bess. The Elizabethan climax to this volume (part two, from 1603-2001, will appear in the new year) shows Schama at his narrative best and thematically most inspired. There's a splendid passage on the cult of the Virgin Queen, a horror movie rendering of Mary Queen of Scots' execution and, perhaps best of all, an exquisite aside on the place of the oak in English history: </p> <p> 'Ancient Britons were thought to have worshipped them; righteous outlaws are sheltered by them; kings on the run hide in them; hearts of oak go to sea and win empires.' </p> <p> For all that, Schama's Europhile preferences colour his account of that supreme 'hearts of oak' episode: the Spanish Armada. Having described how the Spanish fleet was almost comically vulnerable to Drake's quick-fire fleet and the treacherous waters of the Channel, he concludes that: 'It was in the waters between Scotland and Ireland that the Enterprise of England truly came to grief: the sailors and soldiers were drowned, starved, ravaged by typhus, or picked off by the Irish.' </p> <p>Schama also writes with witty eloquence about the excesses of 'Bessiemania', but in truth he is not the first historian to be more than half seduced by Elizabeth's extraordinary combination of ice-cool statecraft and hot-blooded chauvinism. Determined to show that it was Elizabeth who gave coherence to the fledgling idea of Great Britain, Schama brings down the curtain on his performance with a fine flourish: 'By remaining unmarried, she had, in the end, brought about a momentous union: that of Scotland and England, not yet in one kingdom, but in one person... she had not been barren then, after all.' </p> <p>With a bit of luck, this book will remind the Prime Minister that we still enjoy that Elizabethan inheritance, by the skin of our teeth.</p>",

  "<p>Competition in the credit card market hotted up further this week with newcomer Thomas Cook cutting its rate for balance transfers to one of the lowest on the market, and American Express adding benefits to its green charge card. </p> <p>Travel agent Thomas Cook has signed up more than 10,000 customers since launching its own-brand card in April, and hopes to recruit many more by reducing its introductory annual percentage rate (APR) on balance transfers from 3.9 to 2.9, shaving its rate for purchases from 16.9 to 15.9, and adding a cashback facility for people who use the card to buy their holiday at Thomas Cook. </p> <p>The special offer balance transfer rate lasts for six months - after that it reverts to 15.9 APR. The cashback scheme will give those who book their holiday at the travel agent money back at the rate of 0.5% for up to \u00a32,000 spent and 1% back for \u00a32,000-plus, though this is taken straight off their credit card bill. The card already has a loyalty scheme where customers earn between 0.5% and 2% back in the form of Thomas Cook \"travel pounds,\" which can be redeemed against travel purchases made in its branches. </p> <p>This week also saw American Express sign a deal with online retailer <a href=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">Lastminute.com</a> to offer \"exclusive\" late deals and special offers to its army of green charge card holders. The link-up is part of a multi-million pound revamp of the card. The deals and offers will range from \"experiences\", such as learning to race a power boat or taking a tiger moth flight, to book ing holidays and concert tickets. Card-holders can find out more by logging on to the new Amex website: <br><a href=\"http://www.americanexpress.co.uk/green\">www.americanexpress.co.uk/green</a> </p> <p>The two announcements came hot on the heels of the launch of a new credit card from Capital One with an APR for purchases of zero for the first six months. After that it reverts to 12.9 APR. And for cardholders transferring balances in the first six months, Capital One is offering a lifetime rate of 7.9 APR on the amount transferred. </p> <p>However, research from the company illustrates the challenge it and other newcomers face in persuading the public to ditch their less competitive plastic and sign up for their cards. Its survey found that only one in 10 of us are happy with our current card - but 58% of people would still think twice about changing to a card with a lower rate. When asked why, the most common reason given was that they \"couldn't be bothered,\" says Capital One, which has calculated that inertia is costing UK cardholders billions of pounds. </p> <p>Capital One's offer was slightly overshadowed by a row over the way it, and many other companies, calculate interest. It's common practice in the UK that if an individual has chunks of debt on their card coming from both balance transfers and purchases, what tends to happen is that the interest accumulated on purchases gets paid off after the interest on balance transfers. This effectively means that the more expensive debt is paid last and the cheaper debt is paid first, which clearly isn't beneficial to consumers. Capital One says it is not alone in operating such a system and adds that it has started a review of its charging regime which could result in changes being made. </p> <p>This week also saw Abbey National's internet bank, Cahoot, rated number one in a survey of internet credit cards. Gomez, a company which rates online offerings, said that out of the nine internet credit card issuers it looked at, Cahoot topped its league table, followed by Egg and Smile, the Co-op Bank's online bank. A spokesman for Gomez says its league tables \"will ensure that consumers make informed decisions before signing up with an internet credit card service\".

  "<p>It used to be a place of thugs and drug deals. Now Bondi Beach is home to Sydney's rich and fashionable. Smart caf\u00e9s and surf shops line the streets; sun lovers and bronzed boarders of all ages line the beach. Old red-tiled houses and modern apartments crowd in to steal a view of this famous kilometre of well-trodden white sand, used these past few weeks for Olympic beach volleyball. </p> <p>Bondi was just dunes and lagoons until it was opened to the public as a picnicking and bathing spot in the late 19th century. As Sydney grew, Bondi developed into a working-class suburb. Italian, Greek and Jewish communities gave it a village atmosphere which it still has today. </p> <p>And now that the Olympic excitement is almost over, the controversial \u00a38 million temporary stadium will soon be gone and the pastel shop-fronts and sunshades of the beachfront parade will again have an unimpeded view of the South Pacific. </p> <p><strong> What to see and do</strong></p> <p> Budding surfers can learn basic skills, etiquette and lingo from a seasoned Bondi boarder at <strong>Let's Go Surfing </strong>(tel: 02 9365 1800, two-hour group lessons cost \u00a316). If you already have the skills, hire a board from below the lifeguard tower and join the throng of wetsuits at the southern end of the beach. </p> <p>You can swim safely between the red and yellow flags, without fear of sharks - well almost. The last fatal attack here was in 1937. A specially-erected fence keeps them away and traps the more persistent in its mesh. </p> <p>In colder months (May to August), the Bondi Icebergs do most of the swimming. Founded in 1929, this winter swimming club is a local institution. The turquoise and cream clubhouse overlooks a salt-water pool south of the promenade. On Sunday mornings, you can watch club members fill it with ice, dive in and swim lengths. </p> <p>Winter can be surprisingly cold in Bondi - even hardened surfers grimace as they brace against biting winds. Instead of bikinis and shorts, the promenade is a catwalk for ponchos, bell-bottom jeans and floppy felt hats. Some days though are warm enough to lie back with a book and eat Dutch ice cream in Bondi Park above the beach. </p> <p>Behind the promenade walls and the busy skate ramps, a gallery at the cream-washed <strong> Bondi Pavilion</strong> exhibits work by local artists and there are workshops and stage performances year round.

From the Point, head down to Bronte where sausages sizzle on coin-operated barbecues around family-filled picnic booths. </p> <p>For more serious exercise there is a staggered fitness circuit along the walk. Push up, chin up and sit up on well-worn metal bars until you reach Coogee, which has a more relaxed atmosphere than Bondi but a less impressive sweep of sand.</p> <p><strong> Events</strong></p> <p> <strong> Sydney's Fringe Festival</strong> in January (tel: 02 9365 2197) has free comedy, dance and film shows in the pavilion and on the beach, culminating in a televised nude surfing competition at sunset. </p> <p>In February, the pavilion hosts <strong> Flickerfest</strong>, an international festival showcasing some of the world's best short films. Or head up to the coastal walk for the annual <strong> Sea Theatre Festival</strong>, a celebration of street theatre by local artists. </p> <p>In August, watch runners from around the world compete in the <strong> City to Surf</strong>, a 14km dash from Sydney's Hyde Park to the beach. In September, Australia's largest kite festival, the <strong> Festival of the Winds</strong>, attracts kite flyers from all over the country as well as international music performances and displays. </p> <p>Walk along the coast in October for the <strong> Sculpture by the Sea</strong> exhibition, or stay on the beach and admire flexed muscles in <strong> Uncle Toby's Iron Man</strong> competition. </p> <p>On Christmas Day, thousands of travellers and locals descend on the beach. DJs entertain the partygoers, fenced in to the middle of the beach outside the pavilion. An alcohol-free zone and police presence has transformed the once-unruly gathering. </p> <p><strong> Where to eat</strong><br> </p> <p>Whatever your taste, Bondi caters for it. <strong> Bates Milk Bar and Coffee Lounge</strong> (124 Campbell Parade, tel: 02 9310 4711) blends creamy milkshakes for \u00a31.20.

Fried ham and Tasmanian gruyere cheese sandwiches cost \u00a33.20. </p> <p>At <strong> Hugo's </strong> (70 Campbell Parade, tel: 02 9300 0900), you can eat seared swordfish fillet or Sydney rock oysters at white clothed tables for \u00a38-$12 and admire wall-to-wall wine behind the bar. </p> <p><strong> Bondi Surf Seafoods</strong> (128 Campbell Parade, tel: 02 9130 4554) is the oldest and busiest seafood shop in Bondi. As well as traditional fish and chips for \u00a32.40, owner George Dimitrios offers deep-fried Mars bars, Scottish style. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong></p> <p> For backpackers, the friendly <strong> Indy's</strong> (35 Hall St, tel 02 9365 4900, <a href=\"http://www.indysbackpackers.com.au\">www.indysbackpackers.com.au</a>) has dorm beds for \u00a37.50 a night, and you can use bikes and surfboards for free. </p> <p>The ugly facade of the <strong> Bondi Beachside Inn</strong> (152 Campbell Parade, tel: 02 9130 5311, <a href=\"http://www.bondiinn.com.au\">www.bondiinn.com.au</a>) is a reminder of how Bondi used to be. But the view from the street does not do justice to its clean rooms and ocean views. A double with kitchenette costs from \u00a340 a night. </p> <p><strong> Ravesi's </strong> (corner Campbell Parade and Hall St, tel: 02 9365 4422) is a sign of the new Bondi, the stylish terrace restaurant blending in with the bistros on the parade below.

  "<p>Trees, fast streets, tango and meat sum up Buenos Aires. The streets are European - shaped at the turn of the century by a wave of immigrants, including seven million Italians. Narrow Italian streets and wide Parisian boulevards were filled with lilac blooms of feathery jacarandas and pink-flowered palo borracho, \"drunken stick\", whose tall bottle-shaped trunks lurch drunkenly in Palermo Park, amid lakes, Japanese gardens and dog walkers. </p> <p>The venerable Hotel Bristol was our home, right by The Obelisk, on Avenida 9 July, the world's widest boulevard, which was modelled on the Champs Elys\u00e9es but is bigger. Crossing the 20 lanes was a daily challenge. A good stride would get us three-quarters of the way across, racing the blinking red man. The cars and bikers, with their helmets hanging over their arms, would be straining at the leash for the off. </p> <p>To feel the true headlong rush, take the colectivos, buses that race around the city carving up everybody. We regularly hurtled over to the peeling streets of San Telmo for the Sunday market, and to relish the spot on Defensa where in 1807 the locals, porte\u00f1os, chased out the invading English with boiling oil. Plaza Dorrego was full, the sun burned down and tango dancers arched and twisted for the crowds. Tourists sweated and bought gaucho and tango memorabilia. </p> <p>We ate meat regularly in El Viejo Bazar, one of a thousand Buenos Aires parrillas (barbeque grills). Meat, salt and fire, very simple, and tops anything you know. You can taste the grass, for that is all the animal has eaten. No hormones and no antibiotics. Every cut of beef tastes different. We would start with matambrito, \"hunger killer\", a tasty flank to chew on while deciding what meat to eat next - steaks and ribs, sweetbreads and black pudding. The meat is so succulent that vegetables seem an irrelevance. Grilled peppers are an exception. </p> <p>My favourite haunt was La Estancia (Lavalle 941), where a meal costs $20-$25 a head with wine. Two rent-a-gauchos sweat over a big fire with ribs and goats on spits. Inside, the walls are covered with exuberant murals of gauchos on the ranch rounding up happy steers. Gloomy-looking waiters brought good wine and mountains of hot meat. Twelve hundred people stuff themselves silly late every Saturday night. When we left after midnight, grannies and their grandchildren were still pouring in to eat more meat. Be brave and try the offal: the black pudding is smooth and fine, the mollejas (thyroid sweetbreads) are sweet and rich, and chinchulines (intestines) are delicious if cooked very crispy. Trust me. I am a doctor with a high cholesterol count. </p> <p>Spettus (Avenida Alicia Moreau de Justo 876) is smart and stylish, with London prices by night, but a staggering $15 all-you-can-eat lunch that's hard to recover from. Darkly handsome tango waiters come round with various meats on long skewers. An astonishing salad bar taunts you. Flan and dulce de leche, Argentina's caramelised condensed milk, is the sweet treat. </p> <p>In the end, there isn't a bad restaurant in Buenos Aires. As you get sucked deeper into meat addiction, your pulses quicken every time you see the sign \"Parrilla\". Go with it, you can't go wrong. After all the themed holidays - trekking, fishing and the rest - there's an argument for a meat-eating holiday in Argentina. Do yourself a favour, fly to Buenos Aires and just eat meat for two weeks. </p> <p>But tango is the lifeblood of Buenos Aires, which even has a 24-hour FM tango station. It's in the air, old-fashioned music that won't go away. Carlos Gardel is the porte\u00f1os' favourite son, the personification of tango. He came from the back streets, wrote and sang impassioned tangos, and was laughably handsome. He had a seductive smile. He died in 1935 in a plane crash, but his records still fill the music shops. They say, \"Carlitos is singing better and better every day.\" It's true. Visit his grave and believe. </p> <p>The taxi driver sped down Chacarita cemetery to Gardel's corner. There stands a lifelike bronze Carlitos in his tuxedo, hair slicked back, smiling, with red flowers stuck in his crooked arm and a cigarette inserted by loving fans between his fingers. Two old men were repainting the tomb downstairs. \"You want to see Carlitos?\" I went down and touched a massive mahogany coffin with a wooden rail and solid silver handles. Underneath was a smaller coffin for his mother. After living with her all his life, Carlitos has come back to mama. </p> <p>We took the Subte to Carlos Gardel, to walk in the Abasto, Carlitos' run-down barrio. His and his mum's little house was wrapped in corrugated iron, ripe for restoration. Gardel Alley was a hive of activity. Tomorrow, a statue of the \"Creole Thrush\" would be unveiled. Tango would be sung. Down the alley boys finished spray-can pictures of the famous smile. Carlos looked impressive and spooky wrapped up in his shroud like a body about to be offered to the sea. </p> <p>Played by true \"tangueros\", tango is dark, dangerous music. Hear Ruben Juarez at Club Homero (Cabrera 4946; $30 cover charge per person). Standing with his foot on a chair, his bandoneon - the big black German concertina that is the plaintive sound of tango - on his knee, he hunches over singing, sweat dripping from his forehead. He battles with his bandoneon , stretching and squeezing it and beating it against his knee. He has more passion than is medically safe. </p> <p>It is not surprising that tango clubs should feel like New York jazz clubs in the 1950s. Jazz and tango both came from brothels and low life, booze and drugs. Other great players? Sexto Mayor with Nestor Marconi. In March, Buenos Aires had a tango conference packed with devotees from all over the world. Delegates tangoed in the salons for 10 hours a day, retiring to their hotels to put their feet in ice. Not everyone tangoes, though. It is still vulgar and lowlife, and, even now, smart young porte\u00f1as can dance the Gay Gordons but can't tango. </p> <p>In La Boca, the garish painted port area, people tango regularly in the streets. Some of the raucous canteens on Necochea still pump out loud tango. Full of tourists, Caminito's gaudy pastel walls are worth seeing. The port itself is a graveyard, rotting hulks entombed in a mattress of diesel sludge. If you want to visit this funky waterside setting and still pay London prices, go to Patagonia Sur, an intimate and expensive restaurant serving delicious Argentine-French nouvelle cuisine with large portions and bills. </p> <p> Despite the urban sprawl, an hour or two from the heart of Buenos Aires can see you riding over the pampa. San Antonio de Areco was the frontier between the capital and the unknown. Its bridge was the toll bridge to the interior and the Indians. Now it is a ranching town and the centre of the cattle culture that built Buenos Aires, out here because the city mistrusts the gaucho, symbol of Argentina more than the cowboy is to America. Every November, they hold the nation's biggest gaucho celebration here. </p> <p>Ricardo Guiraldes from Areco wrote Don Segundo Sombra, a dreamlike rites of passage into gaucho life. Before the whirlwind success of Don Segundo, Guiraldes' work brought critical scorn. I went to his estancia, La Porte\u00f1a, to see the well where he had jettisoned his earlier books. Some have been saved and are on show in the excellent museum (Museo Gauchesco Ricardo Guiraldes, tel: 0054 02326 455990, admisssion $3). </p> <p>As well as gauchesque art and memorabilia, they have Walter Owen's manuscript of his translation of the epic gaucho poem Martin Fierro. This is the world epicentre of cowboy literature. </p> <p>Areco silversmiths like Juan Draghi make exquisite silver and gold daggers, stirrups, bridles and mat\u00e9s, for the wealthy horseman with gaucho yearnings. Cowboys have a passion for flash, but gauchos lead the pack. They wear a rastra , a wide belt clanking with silver and gold dollars, chains, horses, flowers, eagles. Stuck in the back is their facon , an all-purpose knife, ornamented with cattle and flowers. Draghi's mat\u00e9s and bombillas for drinking mat\u00e9 tea are richly embellished with leaves and flowers. It is an ostentatious art, tasteful in its vulgarity. </p> <p>Many estancias like Guiraldes' La Porte\u00f1a take guests. We stayed at La Bamba (c/o Ricardo Aldao, tel/fax: 0054 02326 456293, <a href=\"http://www.la-bamba.com.ar\">www.la-bamba.com.ar</a>), with wonderful old colonial rooms and a story-book terrace. Romantic and unruffled, indulged after the mad pace of Buenos Aires. A siesta after lunch, a ride out on the pampa afterwards. Expensive at $260 a night for a double room with full board, but heaven. Great for honeymooners. You can even do a daytrip, go to the museum and visit an estancia for an afternoon ride. </p> <p>We took a bus pilgrimage to Lujan. The Historic Museum has more gaucho and colonial history. In the Transport Museum (tel: 0054 02323 420245, admission $2, open Wed - Sun noon to 6pm), we saw the stuffed carcasses of Mancha and Gato, the horses who walked Tschiffely's Ride. Their transcontinental journey from BA to Washington was a legendary 1930s true-life adventure. Now two heroic horses, saddled up forever, stare blankly with glass eyes out of their glass case. </p> <p>The cathedral's gothic spires modelled on St Pancras station, incongruously rising out of the pampa, shelter the miraculous Virgin of Lujan. Outside, in deference to Her, a sign says \"No Shorts! and No Cameras!\" Inside, at the head of a long queue, pilgrims in shorts are being photographed prostrating themselves in front of the miraculous Virgin. She is Argentina's Guadalupe, her most important Virgin. Her miracle was to get stuck here and refuse to move from this spot. With perfect irony, she is the patron saint of Argentina's moribund railways. </p> <p> <strong> The practicals</strong></p> <p>Hank Wangford flew to Buenos Aires with British Airways (0345 222111), which offers return fares from \u00a3445 + \u00a347.50 tax for a minimum stay of seven days.

  "<p>'I went down to the crossroads/ And fell down on my knees./ Asked the Lord up above: 'Have mercy,/ Save poor Bob if you please'.\" </p> <p>The legend has it that Robert Johnson, the tortured but brilliant blues singer, went down to the crossroads and sold his soul to the devil in exchange for what must have been one of the greatest guitar lessons of all time. The crossroads are where Highways 49 and 61 meet in deepest Mississippi. </p> <p>In African folklore, Esu, guardian of the crossroads, is an intermediary between gods and humans; he must have come over to the cotton plantations in a slave ship, mistaken for the devil. Whatever transpired that dark and steamy night, there's no doubt that this is the home of the blues - devil's music to most white folk of the time. </p> <p>It's not a long ride from Johnson's crossroads, where the dog's still howl at night, the heat is oppressive and the stars shine like the sun flicking off chromed fenders, to the old Stovall Plantation on the edge of Clarksdale. Here you'll still find the ruins of the timber cabin Muddy Waters grew up in. </p> <p>\"Muddy took the music of the Delta plantation,\" says Eric Clapton, \"transplanted it in a Chicago nightclub, surrounded it with an electric band, and changed the course of popular music forever.\" </p> <p>Just about. What's missing from Clapton's mix is the other sounds that Mississippi spawned, which spun together to form rock'n'roll, pop and just about every sound, techno aside, that leaps from radios and stereos worldwide today. </p> <p>There's Clarksdale's other stars, Howlin' Wolf, Son House, John Lee Hooker, Ike Turner and Sam Cooke, but the missing link is Elvis Aron Presley, a white country boy from Mississippi (\"My grandma used to pick cotton alongside Elvis,\" says the check-out clerk in Tupelo's Billion Books store). </p> <p>Elvis, said his first producer Sam Philipps of Sun Records, Memphis, \"sang like a black man\". The two cultures were acceptably joined at a wiggling hip and the records sold like hotcakes. </p> <p>Elvis was born in Tupelo ... </p> <p>\"Tupelo ... Tupelo,/ Everybody's welcome down in Tupelo/ Birthplace of Elvis Presley, the King of rock'n'roll/ The Tupelo symphony will thrill your musical soul/ There's blues and country music, bluegrass and gospel too/ And everybody's listening to good ol' fiddle-tee\" [insert barn- dancing fiddle break here]. </p> <p>That was Buddy and Kay Bain, erstwhile stars of TV's Mornin' with Buddy and Kay. With an oddball gang of Americans and Brits, I went to the Elvis Presley Festival in good ol' Tupelo; we sang this yee-hi song with Kay herself in the parking lot of Estes Fish House on a bellyfull of deep-fried this, that and whaddyagot. No question about it, Tupelo, like much of Mississippi is a friendly place. </p> <p>God knows what lurks behind its big, toothy-grinned smile, but the \"southern welcome\" is real enough. This steamy, underpopulated, agricultural state wandering up from the Gulf of Mexico to the Tennessee River along the mighty Mississippi remains, for many outsiders, the stuff of rednecks and lynching, racism and Mississippi Burning, of gun culture and the Ku Klux Klan. </p> <p>The times, though, are a changing. My Mississippi trail was a hot (95-100F), slow shoe-shuffle through the landscape of the blues and country music, bluegrass and gospel too. And, of course, rock'n'roll. </p> <p>That story begins, as much as it begins anywhere, in good ol' Tupelo. This small, sun-scorched city has been home to the annual Elvis Presley Musical Festival for two years now, attracting something like 35,000 people both times, but, as yet, very few tourists from outside the US, or the Confederacy as I far as I could detect from the accents. </p> <p>\"I ain't got no accent,\" says a local ma-an (ie man, but any word worth its weight in catfish here has more than one syllable). </p> <p>The festival is held, outdoors of course, in the parking lot alongside the hardware store where Elvis's mum, Gladys, brought him his first guitar (the future king of rock'n'roll had asked, as you do in Mississippi, for a gun). And just down the road from the school where, accompanied by that first guitar, Elvis won second prize in a talent competition with a tear-jerking rendition of Ol' Shep, a song about a hound dog. It dies. </p> <p>And we know they cried, because you can't turn a crossroads in Tupelo without being introduced to one of Elvis's old school mates, or Scotty Moore, who played lead guitar on That's Alright Mama back in 1954, Elvis's oldest friend Becky Martin, who invites me home to look at old photos, or Presley cousins galore. Cousin Willy sings a rueful rendition of Blue Moon of Kentucky at Estes Fish House. And who's this down at the town's County Jail to greet us, but none other than Sherriff Harold Ray Presley. </p> <p>You get to meet and hear Elvis impersonators at the festival. Here's Ronnie McDowell backed by Scotty Moore, and Elvis's drummer D J Fontana. Here's Travis LeDoyt who does young Elvis down to a fried peanut butter and banana sandwich. It could almost have been Elvis himself up on the stage. The King returned to play Tupelo big-time after Heartbreak Hotel hit number one in 1956 and even though he had gone to live at his Liberace-style mansion, Graceland, in Memphis, Tennessee, some three hours drive north. </p> <p>First thing he did when he had his big hit was to buy an open-top Ford and drive home to take his pals out to Johnnie's Drive-In on East Main Street. It's still here. A neon-framed cabin where men with arms the size of your waist sit down to dine in denim dungarees, where the pony-tailed waitress is the stuff of Hollywood dreams and the pie is a la mode, and much more. Closed Sundays; the sign reads \"Gone to church\". As do most folks in Mississippi. </p> <p>There are places of worship at every turn. It would be a miracle if you could squeeze a bible between two of them. Linda, Roy, Jeannine and me went to the Good News Church on West Jackson Street. \"Welcome in the name of Jesus, brother.\" </p> <p>Everybody's welcome down in Tupelo, as at Estes Fish House, as in the House of God. The service was one of the best soul and gospel gigs I've been to. No disrespect. \"If only religion had been as fun as this,\" Jeannine said to me above the funkiest rendition of Amazing Grace you've ever heard, \"we'd be saints by now.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Elvis festival rocks on, with Dr Zarr's Amazing Funk Monster, the Mississippi Mass Choir and live music in wired-up bars. Big-haired barflies out sluttin' for the night. More piss-poor beer than you'd ever want to drink. Guys with long grey hair picking Fenders and Gibsons, although the music shops here sell nothing but Yamaha guitars and electric pianos. Where, I couldn't help thinking were the 12-string, rhinestone-set, semi-acoustic Gretches, the whirring Hammonds of yesterday? </p> <p>Back in your motel, the crickets, bigger than a Cadillac, bigger even than your TV, are singing in your room. Twelve - I counted them all out - hopped lazily from a shirt I'd left draped across my ba-ag. But, then, the whole level Mississippi landscape from the Delta and up to Memphis across the border in Tennessee, is alive with the sound of crickets, frogs and man-made music from every passing truck and car. Yet, there are havens where the music is turned down low and an older, grander culture than popular music prevails. </p> <p> W e stop in Oxford, a delightful university town based around a real arcaded square rather than lined along \"strips\" like good ol' Tupelo. The bookstore here is about as good as they get. The caf\u00e9s are fine, the clothes shops a zoo of snakeskin, rhinestone and sequins sewn up the sides of slits and slashes. </p> <p>We eat takeaway deep-fried pickles. \"We'd deep-fry our grandmothers if it was legal,\" suggests Roy. </p> <p>The architecture drifted by as we headed upstate to the sounds of Matreca Berg, the Dixie Chicks, Faith Hill and Johnny Lang to Holly Springs, a town that hosts dozens of supremely-elegant neoclassical clapboard houses and Phillips Grocery which is said to serve the \"finest hamburger in America\" (or so says USA Today). </p> <p>Well, it was mighty fine, but finer still is the setting that, like so many in Mississippi, looks as if it hasn't changed much since the birth of rock'n'roll. A big shack of a building standing by a yard full of lumbering freight trains. Big Coke machine. Big burgers. Big fries. Big, big heat. Mississippi burning. August isn't the month to go way down in Dixie; in fact the Elvis festival, timed to coincide with the King's untimely collapse on a toilet seat in Graceland, is likely to move to the fall next year. </p> <p>We crossed the state boundary into Tennessee, to Memphis and Sun Studios where rock'n'roll took off and where you can cut your disc, burn your own CD for $75 an hour. Just like Elvis. Despite the heat - by now my brain was deep-fried - I wanted to turn around and do it all over again. The Delta. The legends. The music. Meeting astonishingly generous people with a lust for life. And getting deeper under the deep-fried skin of this enigmatic state. Not forgetting Tupelo: \"Now in this friendly city down in Dixieland/ Y'all come to see us anytime you can/ When you're in the southlands and you want some place to go/ Y'all come down to visit us in good ol' Tupelo.\" </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong></p> <p> Delta Vacations (0870 900 5001) organises seven-night fly-drive holidays to Tennessee and Mississippi, flights London Heathrow to Memphis from \u00a3315, fully-inclusive basic car hire from \u00a3189, per week.

  "British capitalism has Labour and the Tories playing good cop/bad cop with us. Despite being the sweatier (unless Hague has something up his sleeve), Blair is good cop. So his line is: \"Look, either you deal with me or you deal with him. I'm trying to help you. I can protect you. But if I go, the other guy's going to be in here, and by now he'll have had a few drinks.\" <p>There is a particularly cold and abusive line put out by the government's spokespeople. They are telling us that, although we might not like what is being done to us, we'd better put up with it or the Tories will take us into care. </p> <p>And this crude blackmail certainly strikes a chord. It would seem an extraordinary feat to be a more illiberal home secretary than Jack Straw, but there is actually one in waiting. If he does scrap the right to trial by jury, she won't bring it back, despite the Tory peers who occasionally balk at the steady erosion of our civil rights. No, Widdecombe would be a nightmare. Despite the knockabout turn she will do next week, she is not \"good value\"; she is cheap and nasty. Yes, she is indeed a \"character\" - in the sense that it would be better if she were fictional. But the fact that she makes Straw look good doesn't mean that he is. Her plans to use mass detention of refugees don't make his use of widespread detention something worth defending. </p> <p>It is one thing to say that the Tories are more horrible than Labour. Of course they are. But the government's little helpers go further. They are telling us to submit entirely or take the blame for a Labour defeat. They tell us how easy it is to carp from the sidelines; and it's true that I would find it considerably more difficult to suppress all thought and conscience and become a craven, stupid cheerleader for a project I don't agree with. Somehow, the government and its propagandists just can't accept that some of us actually hate their persecution of asylum seekers and their love of corporate power. They say we just can't get out of the habit of opposition; they can't understand the compulsion we feel to keep opposing things even after the names of the people doing them have changed. </p> <p>People who have made the transition into New Labourites can't handle the fact that there are a great many of us who passionately wanted to get the Tories out and have no desire to see them back, but who are seriously opposed to government policies and prepared to protest about it. They themselves gave up fighting; they found it pointless to resist and now they feel much better. </p> <p> We say to them: \"Your party lied about believing in free and non-selective education; it privatises essential services; it stigmatises and marginalises the most vulnerable people in the world and calls it an asylum policy; it kills Iraqi children with bombs and sanctions; it left deadly anti-personnel weapons all over Yugoslavia; it feasts with the super-rich and gives them government handouts; it seeks sponsorship from the worst multinationals in the world.\" And they say: \"Well why don't you join us and we can talk about it?\" </p> <p>They think that we don't support the government because we're not prepared to get our hands dirty. Hands I don't mind, but if it is neurotic not to steep your very soul in filth, then call me a hygiene-crazed obsessive. </p> <p>They try to equate attacks from the left with attacks from the right; to give the impression that the government is an honest broker caught between impossible demands. They contort logic. If we say the government should renationalise rail, they say: \"Well why don't you go and join your Tory friends in the Countryside Alliance?\" And yet they, who justified the mass ditching of principles on the grounds of electoralism, acclaim their government's suicidal determination to lose the next election as a principled stand. If they were right in their assertion that \"there's no point in having principles if you can't get elected\", how is it purposeful to lose an election because you've forgotten you dumped your principles some time ago? </p> <p>Media commentators don't understand our times either. They think that, because union leaders are now prepared to kick the government occasionally, Labour will suffer at the polls. It never occurs to them that more people might vote Labour if they think the Blairites don't have it all their own way. I acknowledge that there are still people in the Labour party trying, not very successfully, to pull it leftwards. And Gordon Brown might realise that he needs to dump his ideological baggage and up pensions considerably to keep the Tories out, although he won't do it if pensioners prostrate themselves loyally before him. </p> <p>That is not to say I don't envy him. The debate in Prague this week was a lot more impressive than the ones in Brighton. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Chives says \"neighbourhood\" quietly but distinctly. It is a small, intimate kind of restaurant. The walls are white, without decoration. The floor is wood the colour of corn, as are the tables and chairs, which softens the cool of the white. The menu is interesting without being in-your-face. No first course is more than \u00a35.50, no main course more than \u00a313.50, and the puddings are \u00a35 or less. And yet the bill for Bill and I came to \u00a382.60. It just seems impossible these days for two to eat out reasonably well (and our lunch at Chives was rather better than reasonably well) in London for less than \u00a380. </p> <p>That will probably get me a whole raft of letters from readers, chefs and their PRs telling me about some gem of gems where you can get three courses of the finest food on God's own acre for less than a tenner and with a magnum of bottled sunshine thrown in for good measure. But, in my experience, such places are so few and far between that you are more likely to win the lottery. </p> <p>That is not to say that you cannot eat pleasurably and decently for less than \u00a340 a head. You can, and I have reviewed a few places along those lines. But when it comes to your common-or-garden smart, metropolitan eating house with style and social ambition, then 80 quid for two seems the norm - and that means 90-odd quid, if you add in a fairly standard 12.5% service charge (tip, gratuity, call it what you will). </p> <p>Of course, drinks account for a certain amount of the total. We drank a bottle of juicy Tuscan Morellino di Scansano that weighed in at \u00a322 - probably a mark-up of around 200%, which isn't extravagant by restaurant standards - and this was very well worthwhile drinking from a list largely devoted to Italian wines. To that we must add a brace of Campari sodas, \u00a310 the pair, which is excessive but not abnormal; one double espresso and a single, \u00a33.60 all-in. So, the total for non-food items was \u00a335.60, a shade under half the total. That left \u00a347 on food, or \u00a323.50 for three courses each, which doesn't seem so bad - and, in fact, wasn't bad, considering the quality of the grub. </p> <p>You can tell a lot about a chef from the way in which he or she treats small details. A little cup of cauliflower soup came our way before the main show kicked off. It was smooth and velvety from passing through sieves, and indubitably cauliflowery, with the vegetable flavours seamed into top-quality chicken stock. It was the stock that made this little dish something of a show-stopper. </p> <p>Bill went the way of a brochette of crispy salmon with vinaigrette of capers and chives (I give you menu-speak raw and unadorned). The salmon was average-quality farmed stuff, but the treatment gave that unremarkable protein a real touch of class. The top was, indeed, crisp, bringing out a certain meatiness, and the vinaigrette was luscious, fresh, tingling the tongue, without killing the flavour of the fish. </p> <p>The ravioli of duck confit with a velout\u00e9 of lentils on which I lavished a good deal of time was quite the opposite. Whereas Bill's dish sprang around the mouth with zip and energy, mine was subtle, comforting, elegantly muscular, gradually filling out as I chewed and swallowed. There was only one raviolo, but its casing was made of delicate, lightweight pasta, as it needs to be. The filling was delicately fibrous, the sweet meat devoid of all fattiness. On top was a little frizz of what I take to have been shredded skin roasted to a crunch. The earthy nature of the lentils had been given an additional authority by a superb duck stock cut with a shade of vinegar. </p> <p>This sophisticated handling of the underlying materials helped make my next course of roast cod with shellfish ragout and bouillabaisse sauce a class act, too. The sauce tasted resolutely and resoundingly of shellfish, that wonderful toasted sweetness that comes from roasting lobster, langoustines and prawn shells before you start making the stock. The cod had also been given the crispy treatment, which, I suspect, involves a judicious bit of salting beforehand to draw out some of the liquid. The flesh underneath broke away in easy, glistening sections. It was a bit of a star turn. </p> <p>The salad that I had asked to go with it was one of the few disappointments: the leaves were a run-of-the-mill jumble of torn-up bits that you can find in most supermarkets, with a dressing from which someone appeared to have omitted the oil. It was inedible. </p> <p>Some cost-cutting on the raw ingredients also cast a shadow over Bill's rump of lamb with crushed potatoes and jus Ni\u00e7oise. It was a dish that would have worked if the lamb had had any kind of distinctive flavour, but this particular beast had a fugitive, slightly watery quality, which provided no focus for the dish. The other parts were fine, although I do long for a chef who can think of something other than some variation on the Ni\u00e7oise/ Proven\u00e7al/olive-crusted/garlic-and-something approach to lamb. This wasn't bad, just disappointing in view of the surrounding quality. </p> <p>We returned to the sunny uplands with our puddings - a pear-and-almond tart with exemplary pastry and a sublime pear sorbet, and some wonderful light, crisp peach beignets with a showcase vanilla ice cream. </p> <p>So, I paid up \u00a382.60 (or \u00a392.84 including service charge, tip or gratuity). I pondered on the price. It had been worth it - I felt very well fed, and not fed up. Still, \u00a382.60 is no small potatoes. How do you get away for less these days?</p>",
  "Tony Blair's government was bowing to the inevitable last night when ministers from both sides of the euro divide admitted that Denmark's rejection of the single currency left a referendum in Britain years away. <p>Despite public protestations that the Danish vote had no implications for the UK's decision, talk of a referendum within a year of a Labour government being re-elected next May was evaporating fast. </p> <p>Privately, it was admitted that the government would only risk a plebiscite on the single currency when the treasury's five economic tests had been met and powerful political resistance to Britain's entry had been overcome. </p> <p>The government pointed out that there was no commitment to holding a referendum in the next parliament, merely the presumption that one would be held. The cabinet, advised by the treasury, will assess whether the five tests have been met early in the next parliament and only then make a decision. </p> <p>It was acknowledged yesterday that Thursday's vote called for a more hard-headed approach in which arguments about the loss of British influence outside the euro were unlikely to cut much ice with a deeply sceptical public. </p> <p>Preparations for a retreat on the referendum were already evident at Labour's Brighton conference last week. Mr Blair and key allies like Peter Mandelson injected far more emphasis on the need to make the political case - not just Gordon Brown's five economic tests - to wary voters when the time comes. </p> <p>Sources said yesterday that it was clear that the risks of holding a referendum had increased, and there was a reluctance to put the possible fruits of a Labour second term in jeopardy when the odds were so stacked against victory. </p> <p>While Labour was putting a brave face on the Danish vote, William Hague's senior lieutenants were jubilant. They claimed that the \"old one-size-fits-all dogma\" of EU centralisation and harmonisation would be forced to give way to a multi-system EU thanks to the \"courageous\" Danes. </p> <p>\"Labour's arguments about our being 'left out' or 'losing influence' unless we sign up to every integrationist project are bogus,\" said Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary. </p> <p>With Mr Blair resting after his party conference, Robin Cook led the pro-euro camp in insisting publicly that the Danish vote will have no effect on the British debate - and that it was vital to the national interest to keep all options open in contrast to the triumphalist reaction of the Eurosceptics. </p> <p>Mr Brown believes the best way of keeping such options open this side of the election is to kick the single currency into touch. Neither side was openly showing its hand yesterday. </p> <p>But one influential MP, Martin O'Neill, pro-euro Labour chairman of the Commons department of trade and industry select committee was more frank in admitting that more delay is the likely result. Mr O'Neill told Radio 4's World At One programme he had hoped the euro's decline would have been reversed thanks to last week's central bank intervention to put a floor under its fall. </p> <p>\"That has not happened. Until it happens, I think we will find that the Labour government is quite capable of saying we cannot risk a massive devaluation which would be required for us to harmonise with the euro, and that therefore there will be a continuing delay. </p> <p>Mr O'Neill added: \"The value of your currency is not a subjective economic test. It is one that is there for all to see. Unless there is a marked improvement in the value of the euro, I think it would be very difficult for people like myself who want us to join...quickly to advocate an accelerated process because it would mean devaluation and the threat of inflation.\" </p> <p>In Copenhagen, the aftermath of Thursday's referendum saw policymakers desperately trying to defend the krone from speculative attack. The government raised interest rates by half a percentage point to 5.6% and insisted that its commitment to Europe remained strong despite the resounding No to the single currency. </p> <p>\"We'll do all we can to safeguard our fixed currency link to the euro,\" said the prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, who led the Yes campaign in its defeat by 53.1% to 46.9%. </p> <p>Holger Nielsen, of the Socialist People's Party, said: \"The referendum has shown that there is a huge gap between law-makers and voters.\"</p>",
  "Bagpipes, fireworks, rock music and litres of beer greeted the news that Danes had delivered a resounding No to joining the euro. But in the cold light of day worries quickly surfaced about what their dramatic vote would mean. <p>Noisy celebrations continued in the square outside the Folketing - parliament - into the early hours, long after disconsolate Yes campaigners had gone home. </p> <p>Yet it didn't take long for soul-searching and recriminations to begin. If Denmark famously suffers from a Hamlet syndrome - recurrently worrying whether something is rotten in the state of Europe - then the morning-after questions were deeply introspective - and painful. </p> <p>Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democratic prime minister, looked only slightly less grim than when he conceded defeat at midnight as he wondered whether his countrymen had exercised \"power without responsibility\". </p> <p>Otherwise, he kept a low profile, contemplating his failure to convince an independent-minded people that it was in their best interests to scrap the 125-year-old krone. </p> <p>But the nej voice rang out loudly from right and left. Pia Kjaersgaard, who heads the anti-immigration Danish People' s party, was delighted. And so was Holger Nielsen, of the Socialist People's party. </p> <p>\"This is the fist of the people in the face of power,\" exulted the tabloid Ekstra Bladet, the only paper to call for a No vote. \"Democracy works.\" </p> <p>Commentators agreed that the 53.1% result was an impressive victory that compared favourably with the 50.7 % who caused havoc in rejecting the 1992 Maastricht treaty - freezing the entire European project in its tracks. </p> <p>That vote was overturned a year later, but only at the price of the controversial opt-outs, on the single currency, defence and justice and home affairs. </p> <p>And it was that elaborate arrangement that gave rise to the immortal, if obvious, neo-Shakespearean quip by the then foreign minister, Uffe Ellman-Jensen - \"To be, and not to be, that is the answer.\" </p> <p>But referendum fatigue - a key feature of conversations across this country of 5m yesterday - means that the other opt-outs must remain in force. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the first result of the vote was a modest 0.5% hike in some krone interest rates - a message that staying out of euroland was not, as the government had always insisted, going to be cost-free. </p> <p>Danish business was devastated. Bang and Olufsen, the country's most globally recognisable brand name after Lego, had to apologise for a premature press release greeting the Yes victory it so badly wanted. </p> <p>Other costs included the unpleasant reminder that the campaign had opened up deep fissures in a normally consensual society. </p> <p>With the country's elites ranged solidly in favour of the euro and \"ordinary\" and less well-educated working people against, Denmark had become a touchstone for an entire world view - outward-looking and open-minded versus fearful, suspicious and introspective.</p>",
  "<p>Brian Keenan recalls every moment of his release from captivity in Beirut. How, after four and a half years chained to a wall in cells never more than six foot by four, they came to him, out of the blue - \"You go home Braham.\" They had always confused his name, calling him a mixture of Abraham and Brian. How they tricked him out of saying goodbye to his friend, fellow hostage John McCarthy - \"Later, later you see him\" - then bundled him into a car and took him blindfolded, his head on one guard's lap. \"And him stroking my face.\" First to one room, where he tried to leave a message in a book, writing with a burnt-out match. Then, in another car, to the hills above the city, where Keenan was passed over to the Syrians. As they walked towards the Syrians, the young guard held his hand - not roughly, but like they were mates. Two people who would not meet again. \"I guess they are all dead now. I don't say that with relish. And I don't know it for sure. But it's what I imagine.\" </p> <p>At the Dutch Embassy in Damascus, after a two-day debriefing by the Syrians, they treated him lavishly, like a returning hero. He was offered anything he wanted. What he wanted, he said, was first an Irish coffee and then some chocolate and an ice cream. \"Which is odd, because I don't even like chocolate.\" Kids' comfort food. But they brought him a full-blown meal, anyway. \"Insisted on it\" - knowing, or thinking they knew, better than he what a man who had endured so much deprivation must desire. \"I couldn't eat a thing.\" </p> <p>And so it began. His re-emergence into a world he thought he knew, the world he had left behind, but different now. Not so much because the world had changed, or even because he himself had changed. But because his place in the world had changed. He went into the cell Brian Keenan, an unknown university teacher from Belfast. He then became Brian Keenan, the disappeared. </p> <p>\"Not to myself. To myself I never disappeared, I knew exactly where I was.\" Crucial, this. All the time that the world knew nothing of his existence, he hadn't ceased to exist, though he had transposed worlds. His reality, confined though it was, was his own. He didn't look outside. \"My recollection is that if you focus on the real world, which isn't your real world, because your world is here in your head, then you are going to make life very difficult.\" </p> <p>In his account of this time, An Evil Cradling, he describes \"a world in which nothing happens, and yet everything happens\", and his struggle to retain control over this world. Now, he says, \"In these conditions the mind opens up.\" As if the external constraints somehow operate to remove inner constraints. \"You are in the dark, there are no windows, you can't see. But, tiny and oppressive as it is, you find in your mind ways to push the walls back.\" What he's describing is kind of liberation. It's a paradox he is well aware of - that in captivity he was somehow free. And yes, he says, there have been times when he has wanted to go back there. \"Because the mind was so lucid and so fascinating. But, of course, I am not going back.\" </p> <p>He came out and the world embraced him and he became Brian Keenan the man from Beirut. Not his choice. He describes his arrival back in Dublin, on a private government jet, as a series of baffled sensations. The noise. \"People in the viewing gallery cheering.\" The sudden lights. \"Flashing cameras. I was blinded.\" The red carpet under his feet. \"I instinctively stepped off it. I hadn't walked on a carpet in over four years. Charles Haughey, the Irish prime minister of the day, pulled me back on.\" </p> <p>Later, in the hospital where he was sent for routine tests, he suddenly noticed that the walls were the same colour as the last place he had been held. He asked a friend to get him out. The world's press was waiting for him at the hospital doors. \"So Frank suggested taking me out in the boot of his car. And that's how we did it.\" He laughs because of the obvious irony - as though he'd been hijacked again. Which, in a way, he had. Caught in the captive glare of fame. </p> <p>He hates it, and he hasn't got used to it. \"It embarrasses me.\" A shy, modest man, he accepts it when people come up to him in the pub, offering him drinks, asking to shake his hand. He is polite and politely unimpressed. He doesn't want this fame. \"I don't really understand it. What have I done? I didn't ask to be kidnapped.\" </p> <p>He talks about a letter he received recently from a woman whose daughter is dying of leukaemia. \"There's far more heroism in that woman than there will ever be in me.\" Now, he says, he turns down offers to speak about his experience. \"It's the past. Why would I want to do that?\" He has always refused to go to America to lecture. \"I am asked and I say, 'No.'\" Money couldn't tempt him. \"Money has always been the last thing on my mind. Though I don't have a lot of it. I have to work, my wife has to work.\" </p> <p>Stubbornly - it is stubbornness that he considers his principal trait - he has resisted having an identity foisted on him. And this has served him well. But intransigence, as he points out, can carry its own terrible consequences. \"If I believe something, I believe it passionately and no one will change it. It's awful. I am old enough to know better, old enough to rationalise things. But, with me, belief has to be a hundred per cent.\" So he can understand, he says, what happened in Beirut. \"The ramifications of that sort of belief. Why they took hostages. How they came to murder six people. I don't approve. But I can understand it.\" </p> <p>John McCarthy once explained to me how between them they developed a way of dealing with the guards. \"Brian would confront them, refuse to give in to their ludicrous little demands. Make a stand. Then I would negotiate away from this ...\" And, as with the guards, Keenan is not renowned for his easy co-operation. No one could persuade him, after he came out, to write his memoirs before he was ready. \"I had decided I would not write a book until everyone was out. They would all have their own stories, no way would I pre-empt anyone by getting in first.\" And if some of them hadn't come home? \"Maybe I would still have written it, but I would have asked the families first. I would have had to. I couldn't have lived with myself if I had caused any hurt, because then I would have become my own little terrorist.\" </p> <p>He had to wait a year before McCarthy was released in August 1991. And almost six months more before first Terry Waite, in November 1991, and then Terry Anderson, a month later, were released. These must have been terrible times for him. \"No,\" he says, \"not really. I worried at first, but I was always confident they would come home.\" Even after he knew about the deaths of the Americans? \"I can't remember,\" he says, \"when I found out that the Americans had been killed.\" He wrote in An Evil Cradling, and he reiterates now, that he felt bad about leaving McCarthy alone. He still thinks about it, and is not clear in his mind if he did the wrong thing. Though he had no choice, there was a mutual debt between them. That's what he learned in captivity, he says. </p> <p>\"That survival is mutual. Everyone there had to put a part of themselves on the table for everyone else to take what they needed.\" So, until the debt was clear, he would not be free to act. He is a very unusual man, in many ways no doubt. But in one way in particular. He is not prepared to be cynical. Unmodern, you could say, in that way. </p> <p> There is some irony but no coincidence that Keenan was born in Belfast - \"the most political city I have ever been in\". His personality was formed in that divide - the weight of one group oppressively bearing down on another. He was brought up a Protestant. \"For what that's worth.\" And he was 18 when the Troubles started in 1968. \"I suppose I could have got caught up in it. If I'd been a bit younger, had less of a head on my shoulders, I could have been locked up in a prison in Belfast rather than in Beirut.\" </p> <p>His mother, a housewife, used to say to him: \"Politics stops at your doorstep.\" \"But I never knew if she meant coming in or going out.\" His father was a telephone engineer and before that he worked on the buses. A sweet man. \"I remember him bringing home all these injured animals he'd find on the road and mum telling him to get them out.\" </p> <p>Keenan took his destiny in his hands, dropping out of the plumber's apprenticeship he started, getting himself to university to read English literature, and then becoming a teacher: the only kid in his street, as he has often said - and not in a self- congratulatory manner - to do so. </p> <p>Though he loves Belfast, he kept trying to get out. He lived in Spain, in Brussels, did a community care course in Aberdeen. But he kept going back. \"It's my city, my home and things were happening.\" But by the mid-80s, he'd had enough. \"Belfast was falling apart.\" He had given up teaching, \"because what the kids needed to learn they were learning on the streets and not in my classroom. And maybe they were right about that. WB Yeats wasn't going to get them through it.\" </p> <p>Community work was more frustrating. \"Because, whatever you tried to do, it just came back to politicians fighting and bitching.\" He was 34, \"very discontent\", so he made a plan to go to Australia via Beirut, where he had a contract in the American University to work for one year. He knew Beirut was a dangerous place. But then, from anyone's perspective, so was Belfast. He almost changed his mind. \"I suddenly felt very apprehensive.\" Then the stubbornness kicked in. \"And I am afraid of being afraid.\" So he made himself go. </p> <p>Keenan is an odd mixture of the literal and the intensely poetic - both these helped to preserve him in prison. He used his willpower and his practical intelligence to make what sense he could of what was happening to him - he could kid himself for only a few days that they'd let him out as soon as they found he was an Irishman. And, as he has said, he used his imagination to escape into himself. Alone, for five months, he invented or rather elaborated a character, Turlough O'Carolan, Ireland's national musician, a 17th-century itinerant blind harpist, who became his companion. A strange choice, you might think, when he could have imagined some sexy seductress. But, as he knew, or was beginning to know, survival depended somehow on suspending desire, not promoting it. Men in prison, he says, think of sex far less than you'd believe. \"That's an invention from movies. The men I knew in captivity didn't talk about sex much at all.\" They couldn't bear to. </p> <p>O'Carolan became his companion. A way of distancing himself from what was happening to him. He helped to keep him sane. Psychiatrists, Keenan says, would probably have declared him clinically insane for much of this time. \"And they may be right. But they may also be wrong.\" For Keenan, Turlough was a lifeline and he made a deal with himself. When he came out, if he came out, he would commit himself to two tasks. He would build a house on the west coast of Ireland, which he has done: a traditional cottage with the view out of one window of Clare Island and out of the other a view of Croagh Patrick, the holiest mountain in Ireland. And he would write a book, a novel, about this man who came to him in his cell and would comfort him. </p> <p>Someone, trying to be clever, once said that the Irish are sentimental about causes but never about people. Keenan is a living rebuke to this. The only debts he wants to repay are to people - those who have helped him. In spite of his temper, which he says is terrific, his passion and his conviction, he seems utterly without vengeance. Anyway, he kept to his deal - built first the cottage and then set about writing the book. \"It was a debt of honour,\" he says. \"I was doing it for him and for me. To get the monkey off my back.\" </p> <p>It was almost impossible, he says. He couldn't find a way of inhabiting Turlough's head. \"I am no historian, I am musically illiterate, I can't play the harp. I am not blind.\" And apart from this he had never written a work of fiction. Quite simply, he didn't know how to do it. He'd start, chuck it in. Start again. He couldn't get rid of it. He was invited to give a lecture in Alaska on writing. It seemed a good place to go to get away, but even here he found himself talking about Turlough. </p> <p> Some time after he got home to Ireland, he received a letter from an Inuit woman who had heard him speak. He could hardly make out her name and she didn't give an address. \"I always reply to people who write to me however mad they may seem.\" She told him that Turlough is what is known in native American mythology as a dreamwalker. \"Someone who inhabits dreams, who sees in his dreams. Who has, what this woman called, blindsightedness.\" Keenan thought she was nuts. But then she wrote again, and again no address. And as she explained more about dreamwalkers in her letter, he began to see a way through to the man. </p> <p>What was known about Turlough was his music, his art. He is honoured and revered by many musicians through the centuries, in contemporary times particularly by the Chieftains, who have been playing Turlough's music for 30 years. Yet nothing was known \"of Turlough's head and his heart\". </p> <p>This is the book Keenan has written. An imaginative exploration of the man. Another kind of cradling, you could say, though this time benevolent. Keenan visits Turlough on his deathbed, comes into the room where he is dying, much as Turlough came to him in his room when he was in despair. And through Keenan's book Turlough is reborn not as a musician, not as a historical character, but as a man. \"Fleshy, honest, frail, complex.\" And if this sounds like a self-portrait, it may be that, too. There are echoes here, too, of Eliot's lines in his great poem Journey Of The Magi: \"I had seen birth and death/ But had thought they were different; this birth was/ Hard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death.\" And ... \"I should be glad of another death.\" </p> <p>In allowing himself this other death, Keenan himself is reborn. He doesn't see it this way, couldn't be expected to - rejecting as he always has the identity of the man from Beirut. But it is there in the parallels between the two men: the sensory deprivation; the interior journey; Turlough's estrangement from his own background - he comes out of the peasant community and is taken up by the Irish ruling class as their itinerant minstrel - much as the west would have had Keenan play its tune. And all this, as Keenan says, at one of the most brutal times in Irish history, the late 17th century, when the Protestant ascendancy finally crushed the Catholic opposition. </p> <p>\"It marked the end of old Ireland, the end of the Gaelic order, when everything was taken from us, even our language was taken from us. If the term ethnic cleansing has any meaning, it was there in Ireland three centuries before it was manifest in eastern Europe.\" </p> <p>Much as Turlough was able to reconcile his two worlds - Ireland the physical place with all its history, \"which, though he couldn't see what was going on around him, he could sense\", and his own inner life, through music - this book becomes Keenan's reconciliation, the means finally by which he can take control again of his own destiny. You could also say that it signals Ireland's destiny - which is not English control. \"I do believe that this island should be one land.\" All of which makes it a bold book. Keenan is nervous, he says. \"It hasn't gone out to the public yet. I think that maybe the people who have read my books before will find this a strange departure.\" But then this is, of course, its point. </p> <p>When he was in the cell, he tried not not to think about love, and when he came out he wasn't ready to. \"Coming out of that place, where there was so little in the way of affection, I was very aware that I could just fall into something.\" So he took his time, went off to live in a house in County Mayo lent to him by a priest. \"I'd never met him, but he wrote to me offering the house.\" It was away from the media, there was no phone, no television. \"No one could find me there.\" And he started to think and eventually to put on to tape his experience of those four years. One day, he was playing it back to himself, \"and I realised I was just weeping, it all came flooding out, like Vesuvius. There I was listening to this man, who was me, talking out that cell, the tears streaming down my face.\" He remembers the day. It was, he says, exactly nine months after he came out. That's how long it took to give birth to the human being again. </p> <p>It was soon after this that he rang Audrey, a physiotherapist he had met while he was in hospital. \"I had rather cheekily taken her number from one of the duty rosters.\" Five years ago, they married and they now have two sons, Jack, three and Colum, 10 months. \"People say Colum is a Scots name. But it's not. It's an old Irish name that was stolen by the Scots.\" </p> <p>He wasn't sure about fatherhood. \"I was anxious, still am. I thought, at 45, I was too old. But they are nice kids, lovely people.\" And tall, both of them are going to be over six foot. \"As a small person I always wanted to be tall.\" When he was, his mum used to say to him, \"'Be careful with what you want, you may get it.' So, she was right. I did get it.\" </p> <p>In his book he writes. \"It is memory that ages us not time.\" The mind forgets nothing, he says. \"I may forget things, but the mind doesn't.\" In captivity he found himself remembering details from his childhood, things that he didn't even know he knew. \"I could smell the linoleum in the house I grew up in. I could feel, twirl in my hand, the earrings that my mother wore when I was a child and she'd carry me in her arms.\" So he knows, however much he says, what happened in Beirut is the past. \"It's like a book I can take down from a shelf and read it and replace.\" </p> <p>Beirut is part of him.

  "<p>Neo-Nazi extremism is a worrying phenomenon. It is, of course, not confined to Germany. It exists in different strengths in numerous European countries as well as the US. We certainly have no grounds for smugness about it in this country. The radical right's nihilistic violence and intolerance make life a misery for ethnic minorities and others exposed to a climate of fear on a daily basis. </p> <p>In Germany, the problem is particularly pronounced in the eastern provinces which, until 1990, formed part of the German Democratic Republic and still suffer from relative economic deprivation. Though serious incidents of neo-Nazi terror have frequently taken place in cities such as Rostock, on the Baltic coast, conditions for foreigners - especially from eastern Europe or non-European countries - are in some ways even worse outside the big cities where, as was the case with Jews in Nazi Germany, they represent particularly exposed targets. </p> <p>The neo-Nazi organisations have no coherent ideology to speak of. Like the Nazis of the 1920s, their worldview is made up of a crude amalgam of phobias and resentments fixed, inevitably, on the vicious search for scapegoats. Unlike the original Nazis, however, they have no possibility of latching on to important strands of an existing political culture. </p> <p>In the 20s, the aim of building an ethnically pure \"national community\" which would eradicate social divisions and bring power and prosperity was beguiling for more than just hardline Nazi supporters. And it was a vision which Hitler offered to a country wracked by the deepest of fissures, running through state and society, underpinned by a profound sense of national humiliation after the loss of the first world war and the imposition of the Treaty of Versailles. </p> <p>This fertile ground is simply not present today. Neo-Nazi imagery is backward-looking, finding an ideological lowest common denominator in a glorified but completely distorted image of Hitler and the Third Reich. They need a hero - someone who represented a macho-Germany, the power, might and national grandeur which is lacking in their often dismal, unappealing and powerless everyday reality of the present. </p> <p>It is evidently asking too much of latter-day Hitler admirers to see that the \"good times\" of the 1930s led inexorably to the disasters of the 1940s, and that their hero bears the chief personal responsibility for the catastrophe. But most Germans today recognise this plainly. </p> <p>However appalling the actions of the neo-Nazis are, short of the onset of a mega-political and social crisis such as only a war - or perhaps a total collapse of the world-economic system - could bring, they pose no threat to the existing state systems, in Germany or elsewhere. Without such preconditions, they will remain an intense social pest, but one confined to the lunatic fringes of society and politics, not a threat to their substance. </p> <p>In the 20s, the fragile democracy of the Weimar Republic was increasingly devoid of support, both from the masses and from the powerful elites in business, agriculture, the civil service and - not least - the army, biding their time until they could bring back an authoritarian system of rule. </p> <p>As the Depression paralysed the economy in the early 1930s, democracy was as good as friendless. In contrast to Britain, where there were certainly economic, and for a time governmental, difficulties, Germany suffered from a total, comprehensive crisis of the state system itself. Where the structures of the British parliamentary system held firm, depriving Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists of the \"political space\" in which they might have gained support, in Germany the terminal collapse of pluralist, democratic structures left the door gaping wide open for Hitler's takeover of power. </p> <p>Today, Germany is a modern, well-functioning, consolidated parliamentary democracy enjoying overwhelming backing from the vast majority of the population. The pockets of neo-Nazi support would, in the event of elections tomorrow, almost certainly fail to be converted into a single seat in the Bundestag. Far from being tormented by economic crisis, today's Germany is among the wealthiest countries in the world. </p> <p>Its problems are for the most part those shared with other modern capitalist economies. The incorporation of the former GDR has been, and still is a specific problem - there is still a good way to go before the economic and social disparities with the wealthier western parts of the country are ironed out. And the pyschological scars from the perceived disadvantaging of the east will no doubt take still longer to heal. But unless there is unforeseen calamity, Germany's economic prosperity ought to see the problems diminish greatly over the next generation. The residual illusory hopes invested in a new F\u00fchrer will probably then evaporate, as they did following a short-lived upsurge of the radical right in the 60s - apart, doubtless, from an unreconstructed 2-4% of the population (as in other countries). </p> <p>Meanwhile, intensified controls on neo-Nazi activity, more education aimed at heading off recruitment, and, not least, more channelled funding to give disillusioned and sometimes despairing youth in the eastern regions hope for the future and a greater stake in today's democracy, ought to help. </p> <p>There is one further barrier to the radical right. The European Union, for all its faults, provides a level of political co-operation which, coupled with the imperatives of a global economy, offers a strong bulwark against the type of political and economic storm- waves of the 20s and early 30s. </p> <p>Imagine the neo-Nazi problem in a Germany decoupled from the EU (and especially, from its pivotal relationship with France), in a Europe with serious national and economic tensions and conflicts, and reflect whether European integration has been a positive or negative development. </p> <p>Of course, the EU has itself been a source of the resentment that has flowed into the new nationalisms, not least with J\u00f6rg Haider in Austria. Politicians recognise, behind the rhetoric around immigration, objective problems of freedom of population in the post-cold-war Europe have to be tackled. And Haider and his like have succeeded in influencing the agenda of conservative parties. </p> <p>But democratic structures have not been threatened. And were they to be so, then more rigorous and concerted international action than the ill-conceived boycott against Austria would provide serious obstacles to any individual country within the EU wanting to go its own way. In any case, though Haider might be a nasty piece of work, he is no Hitler. </p> <p>So western European democratic structures, and specifically those of Germany, are alive and well and highly unlikely to succumb to the neo-Nazi right. A new Hitler in Germany or the rest of western Europe, short of unforeseen catastrophe, will not arise. Further east, in Russia, where we can only keep our fingers crossed about future developments, a lingering question-mark remains. </p> <p>Ian Kershaw's Hitler 1936-1945: Nemesis is published on October 9 by Penguin, Price \u00a325.<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501025482,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p>",
  "John Major will deliver a powerful rebuke to William Hague next week when he warns the Tory leadership that it will never win an election unless it embraces his brand of \"one-nation\" Conservatism. <p>In his first speech to a Tory conference in four years, the former prime minister will say that Mr Hague's harsh language in recent months has appealed to core supporters but failed to appeal to voters on the centre ground who decide elections. </p> <p>Mr Major has underlined his growing frustration with Mr Hague's lurch to the right by saying in private that he could not join today's Conservative party if he were a young man. </p> <p>Mr Major told a dinner of the Conservative Group for Europe in June that the party of Mr Hague was different to the party of Ted Heath, who was leader when he joined. </p> <p>It is understood that Mr Major, who first made his mark as an anti-racist Tory councillor in Lambeth in the late 1960s, has been dismayed by Mr Hague's harsh language over asylum seekers. Friends say he has also been disappointed by Mr Hague's exploitation of the Northern Ireland peace process, which he launched as prime minister and regards as one of his finest achievements. </p> <p>The intervention by Mr Major in Bournemouth on Monday, the first day of the Tory conference, will come as a severe embarrassment to Mr Hague, who is attempting to present a united front in the run-up to the general election. </p> <p>Mr Major will win a rapturous reception from the party's left when he addresses the \"wet\" Conservative mainstream group, set up by the former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine to oppose Mr Hague's swing to the right. </p> <p>In his speech, Mr Major will focus on Mr Hague's decision to abandon the language of inclusivity, which characterised the first year of his leadership. </p> <p>One wet Tory source said: \"John Major will say that one-nation Conservatism is an important strand of Conservatism without which you cannot form a government. </p> <p>\"He will welcome the Tory rise in the polls but will say that that will only move beyond 40% - where you can think of forming a government - if the leadership moves to the centre ground.\"</p>",
  "The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, last night piled the agony on Ulster Unionists when he announced that convicted terrorists who had escaped custody and fled abroad would no longer be pursued. <p>They can return home and apply for early release under terms similar to the Good Friday agreement, which saw more than 420 paramilitary prisoners released ahead of schedule. The Northern Ireland Office believes none will serve more than a month. </p> <p>There are 21 fugitives who will benefit, all republicans. Sinn Fein had been pushing for the initiative, but the NIO denied suggestions this week that it planned such a move. </p> <p>Ulster Unionists were shocked. They were already furious at the announcement by the RUC chief constable, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, that six army bases in Co Fermanagh were to be demolished despite dissident republican terrorist activity in border areas. </p> <p>The army also said yesterday it wanted to cut troop levels - at 13,500, the lowest since 1970 - to 8,000 as long as the peace process continued intact. Any reductions were dependent on a diminishing terrorist threat to security. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson's move threatened further the Good Friday agreement. Jeffrey Donaldson, the Ulster Unionist seen as a likely successor to David Trimble as leader, stepped up demands for a party summit to vote on immediate withdrawal from the province's power-sharing executive. </p> <p>Mr Donaldson, prompted by the party's catastrophic byelection defeat to the Democratic Unionists last week in Antrim South, would be likely to win such a poll at the Ulster Unionist council. That would spell the end of Mr Trimble's five-year leadership. </p> <p>Mr Donaldson said: \"Mr Mandelson says he recognises the hurt this announcement on jailed terrorists will cause. I don't think he has an idea. There is no provision at all for this amnesty in the agreement. </p> <p>\"There comes a point in the Unionist community when we have to say we won't be suckered any longer.\" </p> <p>Ian Paisley Jr, a Democratic Unionist assembly member, said: \"It is an unbelievably pathetic sop to the IRA. It shows whose exactly whose side Mr Mandelson is on.\" </p> <p>Mr Mandelson denied that the development represented an amnesty. He believed it would not be in the public interest to pursue the terrorists. </p> <p>It means that four IRA men who escaped from the Maze prison in 1983 can call off their long legal battle against extradition from the US. Two more Maze escapees living in the Irish Republic can also abandon their struggle against extradition. </p> <p>Liam Averill, now 35, who escaped from the Maze in December 1997 after dressing as a woman at a Christmas party, is now able to return from the republic. He served little over two years for murdering two men in Garvagh, Co Londonderry, in 1994. </p> <p>Three members of the M60 gang who fled from Crumlin Road courthouse the day before they were convicted for shooting dead Captain Herbert Westmacott, 28, in north Belfast in May 1980 are also thought to qualify. Two are fighting extradition in the republic. </p> <p>Nessan Quinlivan will also benefit. He escaped with co-accused Pearse McCauley from Brixton prison in London in July 1991 while on remand on charges linked to a murder campaign in England. </p> <p>The NIO said the move was the logical next step to the early release scheme, which has led to more than 420 convicted terrorists walking free from the Maze well ahead of schedule. </p> <p>The prison, once home to 1,800 inmates, was empty for the first time last night after the last dozen prisoners were transferred and 400 more officers left the service. </p> <p>The NIO claimed that all of those on the list would serve no more than a month or so if they returned and applied to the sentence review commissioners. But, under the rules of the agreement, the three members of the M60 gang should have to serve a minimum of two years.</p>",
  "Richard Nixon was the last candidate not to take a presidential debate seriously. That was in 1960, the first ever televised contest, in which he faced a little-known senator from Massachusetts. No one has ever made the same mistake again. <p>John F Kennedy came to the debate looking tanned and healthy, having prepared for the event on the rooftop of his hotel. Vice-president Nixon had shrugged off advice to spend a few hours under a sun lamp and his naturally pallid complexion highlighted what seemed like a perpetual five o'clock shadow. </p> <p>As he arrived at the Chicago studio, Mr Nixon knocked an already infected knee against the car door. The pain drained the blood from his face and he began to sweat profusely but he waved away offers of make-up. When the debate went live across the nation, the visual contrast was startling. A vigorous and handsome challenger against a nervous and sweating office-holder. It arguably swung the closest US election of the 20th century. </p> <p>Forty years on, almost to the day, the nation is facing another presidential race which is too close to call. The campaigns are focusing on little more than 1m floating voters in a handful of swing states, where many people say they are waiting for this year's three debates between the vice-president, Al Gore, and governor George W Bush to make up their minds. </p> <p><b> Defining moment</b><br> </p> <p> There is, of course, nothing in the US constitution stipulating presidential debates, but it has become the defining moment of the campaign, when the two (or occasionally three) contenders face each other in direct combat. </p> <p>After his disaster in 1960, Mr Nixon refused to debate with anyone again, and the next televised head-to-head was not until 1976. Since then they have become unavoidable, as Mr Bush discovered when his attempt to renegotiate the debates, shifting the encounters to chat shows, made him look nervous and evasive. </p> <p>Ted Sorensen, a key Kennedy aide who later helped to coach Jimmy Carter and Mike Dukakis for their presidential debates, believes they have become an essential part of the democratic process. </p> <p>\"You can memorise arguments, but it is understanding issues which is necessary to avoid stumbles. And it can't be bad having the next president be forced to understand all the issues,\" Mr Sorensen said in an interview this week. </p> <p>The importance of debates is reflected in the enormous lengths the opposing camps go to in grooming their candidates for the event. Preparations start months in advance. This weekend, in the run-up to the first debate in Boston on Tuesday, both candidates will leave the campaign trail for dress rehearsals as meticulously prepared as anything on Broadway. </p> <p>Each nominee has publicly played down the extent of his preparations, but their studied insouciance is all part of the ritual manoeuvring. Governor Bush has been practising since May. </p> <p>This weekend he will hold a mock debate at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, where the family gym has been converted into a television studio, complete with lecterns, lights, cameras and a mock Al Gore, who will be played by a New Hampshire senator, Judd Gregg. It is a role he has perfected since performing as the slightly stiff and earnest vice-president in 1996, when he was advising the Republican nominee for the job, Jack Kemp. </p> <p>However, Mr Bush's preparations look slapdash compared to the lengths the vice-president is going to. Mr Gore is the supreme master of detail. He likes to ensure that the practice room is set at the precise temperature expected in the television studio, even allowing for the warming effect of the bodies of the audience. </p> <p>In his dress rehearsal, his opponent was to have been played by Tom Downey, a friend and former congressman who had been taking professional acting classes for the role. He had reportedly perfected Mr Bush's mannerisms and even his malapropisms. But this month Mr Downey received a package in the post containing a video of Mr Bush rehearsing for the debate together with a batch of briefing notes. An FBI investigation has been launched. Meanwhile, the Gore campaign, anxious not to be seen taking advantage of the leaks, disqualified a disappointed Mr Downey from the rehearsal. His place has been taken by Paul Begala, a former Clinton aide who shares Mr Bush's Texas accent and has just written a book about Bush's record as governor. </p> <p>Mr Gore has gone even further. When he retreats this weekend to his debate boot camp in a Florida marine laboratory, he will take with him not just the usual entourage of advisers, technicians and supporters, but also 13 specially selected \"regular folks\" from a cross-section of the population in swing states. They include a 76-year-old pensioner, a 14-year-old schoolgirl (chaperoned by her mother) an Hispanic construction worker and a black headmaster. <br> <b>Wit, wisdom and a five o' clock shadow</b><br></p> <p><b> 1960 Nixon vs Kennedy </b></p> <p>John Kennedy: \"We cannot turn the job over to anyone else. If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails, and I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.\" Kennedy looked tanned and relaxed. Nixon was sick and sweating and his complexion made him look unshaved. Afterwards nobody could remember what was said. Only the way they looked. </p> <p><b> 1976 Ford vs Carter </b></p> <p>Gerald Ford: \"There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and never will be under a Ford administration.\" This was at the height of the cold war. </p> <p><b> 1976 VP debate: Mondale vs Dole </b></p> <p>Bob Dole: \"If we added up the killed and wounded in Democrat wars in this century it would be about 1.6m Americans. Enough to fill this city of Detroit.\" Dole's credibility suffered from the suggestion that the two world wars had been political. </p> <p><b> 1980 Reagan vs Carter </b></p> <p>Ronald Reagan: \"There you go again.\" This became Reagan's catchphrase and it blunted Carter's fact-laden attacks. </p> <p><b> 1984 Reagan vs Mondale </b> </p> <p>Ronald Reagan: \"I will not make age an issue in this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience.\" This line helped defuse questions about the president's advanced age, and strengthened his high likeability ratings. </p> <p><b> 1988 Bush vs Dukakis </b></p> <p>George Bush: \"Wouldn't it be nice to be the ice-man, and never make a mistake.\" This rescued the vice-president from his verbal blunders and deepened his image of Mike Dukakis as passionless. </p> <p><b> 1988 VP debate: Quayle vs Bentsen </b></p> <p>Lloyd Bentsen: \"Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.\" </p> <p><b> 1992 Bush vs Clinton</b> </p> <p>President Bush twice looked at his watch, making him look contemptuous of the proceedings and ill at ease. </p> <p><b> 1996 Clinton vs Dole </b></p> <p>Bill Clinton: \"I can tell you I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president. It's the age of his ideas that I question.\" With this line, Clinton could appear gallant and issue-oriented and still portray his opponent as out-of-touch. </p> <p><b> 1996 VP debate: Gore vs Kemp </b></p> <p>Al Gore: \"I'd like to start by offering you a deal, Jack. If you won't use any football stories, I will not tell any of my warm and humorous stories about chloro-fluorocarbon abatement.\" The vice-president was able to make self-deprecating fun of his reputation for being wooden, while neutralising his opponent's strongest card - his past as an American football hero.</p>",
  "The Conservative party gathers in Bournemouth next week under the fairest political weather since William Hague succeeded John Major as leader. For the first time in eight years the party is ahead in the polls. It can also bask in the handy boost of a no vote in Denmark's euro referendum (which we discuss above), an outcome that gives momentum to the Tory side of the argument. Added to that is the Tory belief that they are in tune with the public in at least three areas where Labour is struggling: on fuel, the Dome and asylum. Expect delegates to be in good heart, and for Mr Hague to be on bullish form. <p>Expect, too, much crowing from the Tories about the unity they will present in the conference hall (if not on the fringe), in contrast with the floorfight and defeat meted out to Labour in Brighton on Thursday. By shifting to the right, Mr Hague has largely succeeded in ending the fratricidal wars of the Major years: now the shadow cabinet and most Tory MPs are happy to stand together, in the same rightwing tent. They will gleefully suggest that the natural order of politics has been restored, that the Conservatives are once again marching in lock step, while Labour is back to its old ways, eating itself. This will be a constant theme: that old Labour is back - whether in the form of block votes and back-room deals or a PM and chancellor singing the glories of tax and spend. Expect all that next week - along with the jokes about Tony Blair's sweat problem. </p> <p>Even so, Mr Hague would be wise to avoid premature complacency. By the normal laws of mid-term politics, his party should be much further ahead in the polls than it is now, and have got there much quicker. In these volatile times, the Tories' advantage could melt away as rapidly as it came. </p> <p>For the underlying weaknesses of the Conservative party remain. First, voters have not forgotten Black Wednesday or sleaze, and they do not seem ready to forgive the Tories just yet. Second, Mr Hague's team consists of either reminders of that era or nobodies, Michael Portillo or Peter Ainsworth. Third, for all its recent populist successes, much of the Tory message still sounds too harsh and mean-spirited for large chunks of middle England. And lastly, there is Mr Hague himself - who may well be the Tories' Neil Kinnock: a skilled uniter of party, but a man deemed unelectable by the country.</p>",
  "Earlier this year, Home Office minister Barbara Roche described some asylum seekers as \"vile\". Yet, on September 11, announcing an overhaul of the immigration laws, she stressed the advantages of economic migration. Why the mixed messages? The fact is, Britain is paying severely for the inflexibility of the 1971 Immigration Act. Since then, other than EU members, only the very rich; relatives of UK citizens, short-term permit workers and a few seasonal labourers have been able to work here legally. <p>Now, 20% of national job vacancies are due to a lack of skilled applicants. We have more than 4,000 teaching vacancies in secondary schools; 10,000 nursing vacancies and fewer doctors per head than any other EU country. In addition, the list of sectors in crisis has expanded to include engineering and IT, with the IT industry predicting a shortfall of 1 m workers by 2004. </p> <p>Belatedly, in May this year, David Blunkett announced changes to the work permit system, claiming he wanted it to become the \"most flexible\" in the world. His new \"fast-track\" procedure aims to reduce permit processing time to one week - it often takes months - by making the Overseas Labour Service (a division of the Department for Education and Employment) a one-stop shop. </p> <p>Those seeking to renew or extend their permits no longer need their passports stamped by the notoriously slow-moving Home Office. </p> <p>Firms on this list don't have to prove to the OLS that they scoured the UK, then Europe, before looking further afield. Other improvements are expected soon, including a pilot scheme to allow entry to highly skilled people seeking work. </p> <p>So, is British industry cheering at the prospect of a borderless workforce? It depends who you ask. Certainly, the IT world seems positive. Rod Ireland, northern European HR development manager for Intel says: \"We all compete so hard for people that making it easier to recruit from a wider marketplace will be of real benefit.\" </p> <p>Clare Starmer, resourcing executive at Xerox , agrees: \"Generally, we've avoided permit workers because procedures are too time-consuming. This new approach is a bonus.\" </p> <p>So desperate are IT companies for experts in the latest programming skills that certain firms have captalised on the opportunity. </p> <p>RedBrigade, a subsidiary of US firm iGate Capital Partners, is an IT services-provider to top consultancies such as Cap Gemini. It recruits top-flight software engineers from all over the world, particularly eastern Europe and India. </p> <p>RedBrigade recruits the engineers on to its own payroll and contracts them out to clients. After gaining 600 permits in four years, it is an old hand at the permit system. \"It's not that complex if you follow the rules,\" assures chief executive Guil Hastings. \"The trick is good communication and a certain amount of patience.\" </p> <p>Mr Hastings perceives a sea change in the industry's attitude to overseas workers. \"Two years ago, some companies were resistant. They questioned their English and had concerns about their ability because they couldn't meet them first. You encountered racism as well as valid concerns. However, desperation is a great motivator. Now no company looks askance; they're conscious of the depth of Indian talent.\" </p> <p>As to why India has such a wealth of expertise, Mr Hast ings explains: \"In the 80s, the US put an embargo on India which prevented them from using mainframes. That forced them to work with PCs. Ten years later PCs and client servers have taken over. Basically, India's 10 years ahead of the game.\" </p> <p>Not every industry is so enthusiastic about migration. Anne Bailey, head of education and training at the Engineering Employers Federation says: \"If an overseas student has studied here, people would be happy to have them. But to take people from other countries, we'd have to be sure that they understand our standards. When our workers go abroad we send them on courses to show them what it's like working abroad. Is anyone planning that kind of orientation for people coming here?\" </p> <p>In the health sector, the picture is confusing. On one hand, Tory health spokesman Dr Liam Fox accuses overseas doctors of poor English; on the other, the government says they are the answer to shortfalls. </p> <p>Aside from Dr Fox's assertions, there are other, more altruistic, concerns. A spokesperson for the British Medical Association (BMA) says: \"We'd rather our doc tors were homegrown because you couldn't rely on the overseas sources not drying up; also it's unethical to poach them from developing countries where they are badly needed.\" </p> <p>However, Dr Surendra Kumar, national chairman of the overseas doctors association, points out: \"The fact is the NHS needs more doctors now and has to recruit from overseas. We must ensure they get good training and a choice of specialisms so they return home with something to offer. The NHS can't simply use them to fill gaps.\" </p> <p>He also points out that 20% of UK doctors currently come from non-EU countries. \"Their contribution is rarely recognised and Dr Fox's comments are extremely insulting.\" </p> <p>But why can't the NHS draw on the pool of qualified doctors already here and desperate to work? </p> <p>It is estimated that there are around 2,000 refugee doctors in the UK yet the Refugee Council believes that 80% of them will never practise again. </p> <p>Obstacles include the expense of the medical and language exams to be eligible for work here and registration with the General Medical Council. Totalling nearly \u00a31,000, it's a prohibitive sum for a refugee; yet it costs the NHS \u00a3200,000 to train a doctor. Wouldn't it make economic sense for the government to give training grants to refugee doctors? </p> <p>After heavy lobbying, the issue is being recognised. A parliamentary advisory group has been set up while the BMA is looking into mentoring schemes and information networks. </p> <p>Finally, if doctors of all races and backgrounds are to compete on a level playing field, racism must be tackled. In an experiment reported in the British Medical Journal, half the applications were in Asian names, half in western-sounding names. The Asian names had significantly less chance of being shortlisted. \"The evidence tells us that racism prevents many overseas doctors from climbing the ranks,\" says Dr Kumar. \"Until that's dealt with, it's not a fair system.\" </p> <p><b>The doctor who's not wanted</b></p> <p>Zhargona Tanin, 44, was medical director and consultant gynaecologist at Malaly University Hospital, Kabul, Afghanistan. Currently she is doing some translation work. </p> <p>\"I fled from Afghanistan with my family in the early 90s just before the Mujahadeen came to power. My husband, a prominent journalist, and I were both associated with human rights activities; we knew if we didn't escape we would be in danger and, as a woman, I would lose my civil rights. We arrived in France with the clothes we wore and $800; fortunately we had French visas and gained asylum relatively easily. </p> <p>\"In France, working as a doctor was easy. After a language course and a voluntary hospital attachment, I was offered a part-time position running an obstetrics and gynaecology and family planning outpatients clinic. </p> <p>\"In 1995, my husband was offered a position in the UK and we moved. For a year I worked on a voluntary attachment at a London hospital. Since then I've applied for more than 300 positions both in gynaecology and for the GPVTS (General Practitioners Vocational Training Scheme) and I've had just one interview. </p> <p>\"First I applied for Senior House Officer positions but apparently I'm overqualified. But for more senior positions I must pass the MRCOG exams (Membership of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecology). I've passed Part 1 but now I'm told I can't sit Part 2 unless I have two to four years of work experience, so it's Catch 22. Without an interview, or even any feedback, I can't display my experience. In Kabul, I worked as a GP and a gynaecologist. I saw patients daily; I performed hundreds of operations; I lectured students; I published research papers. Here that counts for nothing. Judging an experienced refugee doctor purely on their application seems discriminatory. </p> <p>\"I miss my work desperately. Being a housewife is a kind of death. There's a terrible irony here; I left a country where women weren't going to be allowed to work to go to somewhere where they were free. But I can't work here either. And every day I hear this country desperately needs experienced doctors.\" </p> <p>It must be said that Dr Tanin's specialism faces particular problems. A BMA spokesperson says: \"We need more gynaecology consultants but the planners didn't create enough posts, so it's competitive.\" </p> <p>However, her failure to gain consideration in junior positions is probably due to a combination of racism and ageism. Dr Sheila Cheeroth, co-ordinator of the refugee doctors project says: \"Rather than think, 'great, somebody with fantastic experience' they'll dismiss her expertise because it's not British. Basically, they'd rather have a UK-trained doctor at the standard age of mid-20s.\" </p> <p>One senior gynaecologist who didn't want to be named commented: \"For a refugee doctor, various factors, including racism, are going to bend the system one way. What they need are senior-level mentors who can bend it in the other.\"</p> <p><b>The software engineer who is wanted</b></p> <p>Niranjan Joshi, 33, took a degree in Mechanical Engineering at Bombay University. With specialist knowledge of wireless technology, he is now working for RedBrigade as a team-builder. He lives in Bracknell, Berkshire, with his wife and three-year-old son. </p> <p>\"I left Bombay in April 1999 to go and work for a US-based company as a software manager. That first time was hard. The culture shock was huge; America seemed so casual compared to India, but there was no sense of community. Also there are practical things. We were given an unfurnished house; and I had to buy a car because the streets aren't safe. These things are a challenge in a strange country. </p> <p>\"Coming here was much easier. It's a good idea to wait until you're settled before bringing over the whole family so I came over alone. Then the firm found me a furnished house in Bracknell; it's a nice, neighbourly community where we feel at home. My son has settled well in the local nursery school. Making friends has been easier, too. I've been here for six months, and I'm on a year's permit. If the company wants me to stay I'd love to.\"</p>",
  "David Abse of Islington Voluntary Action Council has a professional interest in portraying the area as poverty-stricken and \"the eighth most deprived borough in Britain\" (Letters, September 27). <p>The reality is that Islington is a major regeneration success story at the apex of the golden triangle of Europe, running from leafy Highgate in the north of the borough to the golden pavements of Finsbury Square and the City in the south with Westminster in walking distance to the south-west.</p> <p>Islington is home to the Arsenal, the Almeida Theatre, your excellent newspaper, countless millionaires and a mere 15 minutes ambulance drive from some half a dozen internationally renowned hospitals.</p> <p>Certainly there is poverty in Islington, as there is in every major capital city. This is notably the case for pensioners stranded in a high cost of living area, asylum seekers and those with disabilities. But to seriously claim, as David Abse does, that Islington is more deprived than Hull, Sunderland, Barnsley and Doncaster seems self-serving, wishful thinking and a gross distortion of reality.</p>",
  "I was interested to read that Canada and Australia deport convicted criminals to their \"home\" country (Let me disappear, September 28). <p>My flat was broken into by a Chinese national carrying a stun gun. He was apprehended and discovered to be visiting the UK on a tourist visa. Found guilty of burglary and possession of a weapon, he was sentenced to a year in prison, suspended for one year, and immediately released on to the street. I was astonished to learn that the police have no arrangement with the immigration services to organise deportations in such cases.</p>",
  "You are right to call for an end to the voucher system for asylum seekers (Leader, September 29). Save the Children knows from its work with vulnerable children seeking asylum that vouchers are both dehumanising and degrading. They shore up racist attitudes and drive asylum seeking families into grinding poverty. <p>No child should have to make a choice between bus money to get to school and food.

  "<p>Last Saturday afternoon, I was picking my way down the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, taking in the view of the city wall and the Dome of the Rock, when one of my companions pointed out that in the Jewish cemetery to our left lay the body of Robert Maxwell. I had forgotten that Maxwell had been buried there after his mysterious death almost nine years ago, after which Israel had given him a sendoff worthy of a king, with a lying-in-state at which the then president, Chaim Herzog, noted Maxwell's \"significant involvement\" in the country's struggle \"for economic independence, for the absorption of the Russian immigration, for the security of our country, and for the achievement of peace\". </p> <p>At the funeral itself, where the vast corpse of this preposterous man lay wrapped in a prayer shawl, the eulogies continued: the then leader of the Israeli Labour Party, Shimon Peres, said, \"In those waters he lost his breath but not his soul. It will float above the waves as a marker to anyone believing that a man can be bigger than the cards he was dealt.\" The enormity of Maxwell's financial wrongdoing had not then been exposed, but even now there is little embarrassment in Israel about its unqualified admiration of him. His enduring status as a Jewish hero is symptomatic of the Israeli tendency to regard selflessness in service to the Jewish state (a quality that Maxwell undoubtedly had) as a virtue compelling forgiveness of most other sins. </p> <p>At the Anglo-Israel Colloquium on The Role of the Media in the Information Age, an event for which I had been invited to Israel, there were gasps among the British participants when Tommy Lapid, a member of the Knesset and a celebrated television pundit, said that when he had been editor of the daily newspaper, Ma'ariv, under Maxwell's ownership, he had suffered no proprietorial interference. If true, this is further evidence of Maxwell's application of different standards towards Britain and Israel - his treatment of the Mirror was not so much interference as rape. </p> <p>The Anglo-Israel Association, which organised the colloquium, is a fairly new institution, but it deserves a bright future. Last weekend's event brought together an impressive collection of media and political big shots from both countries under the amiable joint chairmanship of John Tusa, the former BBC broadcaster who now runs the Barbican Centre in London, and Lord Samuel, grandson of the first British High Commissioner in Palestine after the first world war and professor emeritus of chemistry at the Weizmann Institute of Science. (He also studied chemistry with Margaret Thatcher at Oxford, where he found her very mousy and lacking in confidence.) </p> <p>One could say, I suppose, that the Israeli delegates were not wholly representative of their country, for many of them were of British birth and education, while many British delegates were Jewish. But this ensured far more conviviality and mutual understanding than is normal at such international conferences, for the participants already had so much in common. Come to think of it, Israel could (or perhaps does) emulate this arrangement with lots of other countries - Israeli Americans talking to Americans, Israeli Russians talking to Russians, Israeli Ethiopians talking to Ethiopians, even Israeli Arabs talking to Arabs. This is one advantage of being such a fractured society. </p> <p> As it turned out, the British participants included the two official British representatives at Maxwell's funeral - the then British ambassador to Israel, Mark Elliott, and Gerald Kaufman MP, shadow foreign secretary at the time - both of whom appeared to wish that they hadn't been burdened with this particular duty. Kaufman's relationship with Israel is interesting, since he has been so outraged by the encirclement of the golden city with dull Jewish housing estates that he refused to go there for several years. As chairman of the Commons' select committee on the media, his relationship with the British press is also interesting - in one intervention, he said he could no longer see what British newspapers were for: they achieved nothing, changed no opinions, and affected no policies. This assessment was disputed. </p> <p>The main theme of the colloquium, however, was the internet and how it has changed the whole media scene. If the meeting reached any conclusions, they were that the only guaranteed safeguard of press freedom is a plurality of ownership (one business group is now poised to assume control of 70% of Israel's media), that public service broadcasting must survive, and that the industry's regulators will have to become more respected and democratically accountable. </p> <p>As for Israel itself, my impression is that the country is so much more confident than it used to be that it will be less ready in the future to overlook the crimes of friends such as Robert Maxwell.</p>",
  "Saffron and cardamom are two of the great exotics, sought after by princes, potentates, panjandrums and, of course, chefs. Made from the hand-picked stigmas of the purple Crocus sativus, saffron has, not surprisingly, always been of fabulous reputation, equalled only by its price. Cardamom is no less distinguished, however, its various forms being celebrated in the Mahabharata, lusted after by the Romans and celebrated in Chinese poetry. <p>Although neither originated there, both spices come together in the cooking of southern India, where they are used sparingly. Both have powerful flavouring qualities, which, if used in excess, bring out unpleasant, bullying and, in saffron's case, markedly bitter tones. Separately, they have marched through the culinary cultures around the world. </p> <p>The British have had a particular affinity for saffron, perhaps because the crocus actually grew in our climate. The curiously named Saffron Hill in the City of London is so called because it was once part of the gardens of Ely Palace, where saffron was grown, presumably for abstemious bishops. And the arms of Saffron Walden, Essex, bear three saffron flowers, a mark of when it was the centre of saffron production, its heyday being Tudor times. It found its way into a host of dishes, as well as buns and cakes, which is a splendid Cornish tradition that is still very much alive today. In retrospect, however, it seems rather odd that it was never used to bring colour and pizzazz to a stew of the fish that are native to our waters, in much the same way that countries around the Mediterranean have done. </p> <p>As with all spices, you have to treat saffron with respect. I have already noted its bullying tendencies if used with a heavy hand (although they are no worse than the herbs rosemary and sage), which may go some way to explaining why saffron has not always had the best press in these matters. The great herbalist, Nicholas Culpeper, noted that it was a \"useful aromatic, of a strong pungent bitterish taste\", while the French gastronome and writer, Alexandre Dumas, described it as near fatal. However, when it comes to adding the drama of colour to a dish, few spices can match saffron, and its distinctive flavour adds a curious and pleasing note. </p> <p>Because of the laborious nature of its production (and the consequent great cost), there is probably more fake saffron about than any other spice. You can find good quality saffron from Kashmir and Turkey, although the best comes from La Mancha in Spain. Remember that heat and, in particular, light are the enemies of all spices, so buy it only in small quantities (you probably won't be able to afford to do anything else, anyway) when you need it. </p> <p>Cardamom similarly loses its vitality when kept for too long. Pliny was spot on when he said that the green pods are the best, but if you're really picky check that the seeds inside are still sticky - if not, those heady aromas to which the Arab world (and, oddly, Sweden and Finland) is so addicted as a flavouring for coffee will be mere shadows. Likewise, ground cardamom. If you are a serious connoisseur, you will insist on your cardamom being the pale green Alleppey cardamom of Kerala, although it is grown all over southern India, Sri Lanka and Indochina, as well as Tanzania, Guatemala, El Salvador and New Guinea. </p> <p>Cardamom, like saffron, has a complicated history. There was some confusion in ancient days between Amomum cardamomum - or \"false\" or \"bastard\" cardamom, which the Greeks and Romans set great store by - and what was designated Elettaria cardamomum , which we know and love today. Quite how the former or the latter found their way into common usage has been obscured by wars, invasions and other such matters, although by the first century AD, Pliny was able to establish that there were four grades of cardamom, and Andrew Dalby in Dangerous Tastes (British Museum Press, \u00a316.99) gives us a recipe from the \"illustrious Vinidarius\", which puts him in mind of one of Jeeves's pick-me-ups that produced the feeling that \"somebody had touched off a bomb inside the old bean and was strolling down my throat with a lighted torch\". </p> <p>Perhaps it isn't surprising, then, that cardamom is a relative of another potent spice, ginger, and was most probably introduced to India from the east, where it was originally appreciated more for its medicinal qualities - as a decongestant, in particular - than for its culinary ones. Bearing in mind these characteristics, while saffron and cardamom pair happily in rice, whether for stuffing or as an accompaniment, it is as well to remember that with these spices less is definitely more. </p> <p> All recipes serve six. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Saffron broth</b> This is a wonderful way of using the broth left over after cooking the chicken below. The delicate liquid is freshened up with some chopped, lightly cooked vegetables and then simmered. A few spoonfuls of an aromatic vinaigrette are added just before serving. <br> </p> <p><b> 1.5 litres chicken liquor (from cooking the bird, above) <br> 2 medium courgettes <br> 2 small onions <br> 6 spring onions <br> 1 leek <br> 3 plump, ripe tomatoes <br> 2 tbsp fresh peas (if available) <br> 1 generous pinch saffron <br> 1 clove garlic<br> 1 small handful chopped parsley <br> 1 tbsp chopped coriander leaves <br> 2 tbsp very good olive oil <br> 1 tsp white-wine vinegar <br> Salt and pepper<br></b> </p> <p>Wash the vegetables. Top and tail the courgettes, and cut them into small, vaguely square pieces. Peel the onions and leek, and finely chop them. Remove the eye from the tomatoes and finely chop the flesh. </p> <p>Put the strained liquor into a generous pot and bring to the boil, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface. Add the onions and courgettes, reduce the heat to a gentle simmer, then, after 10 minutes, add the peas, leek and saffron. </p> <p>For the vinaigrette, trim and thinly slice the spring onions. Chop the herbs and garlic, and place them in a bowl with the spring onions, olive oil and vinegar. After the soup has been simmering for half an hour, stir in the vinaigrette and serve at once. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Poularde \u00e0 la d'albufera </b> I remember a dish of boned chicken stuffed with saffron rice that I cooked years back, and it has since become an old friend. The original version of the recipe was named after the Mar\u00e9chal Suchet, who was made Duc d'Albufera by a grateful Napoleon, after the general's victories in Spain. It is an elaborate dish that I have simplified somewhat here, though, by removing the truffles and foie gras, I suspect that I have merely made it cheaper. The addition of cardamom is a happy one. Once the dish is prepared, it is elegance itself to serve. <br> </p> <p><b> 1 2.5kg top-quality free-range chicken</b> </p> <p>For the stuffing </p> <p><b> 2 chicken livers and 1 chicken heart (they should be in a little bag inside the cavity of the bird, along with its giblets) <br> 40g unsalted butter <br> 2 medium onions, peeled and finely chopped <br> 60g white rice <br> 35ml white wine <br> 35ml Noilly Pratt (or other white vermouth) <br> 430ml chicken stock <br> 1 generous pinch saffron <br> 6 cardamom pods, cracked <br> 1 bayleaf <br> Salt and pepper <br> 1 egg<br></b> </p> <p>Cut the livers and heart into smallish pieces, then fry in just a little of the butter in a heavy-based pot for 45 seconds or so. Transfer to a plate and melt the rest of the butter in the pot. Fry the onions over a gentle heat until softened. Add the rice and stir for two minutes or so, until it becomes translucent. Pour in the white wine and vermouth, then add the chicken stock, saffron, bayleaf, cardamom and a little pepper. Leave the rice to cook, undisturbed, for 15 minutes, until just done. Add the fried liver and heart, and then gently scrape the whole lot into a large bowl. Carefully stir in the egg, then cover and leave to cool. </p> <p>Meanwhile, carefully make an incision along the centre of the breastbone and cut out the two breasts. With a pair of scissors, cut away the exposed breastplate. Season the inside of the chicken with salt and pepper. Put the cooked rice inside the chicken, pushing it gently into the cavity and up against the backbone. Replace the breasts of the chicken on top of the rice, thereby emulating the bird's original form, and with a trussing needle and thread, sew the breasts back together. Finally, tie the bird in several layers of muslin until completely secure. Place the bird in a very heavy pot along with: </p> <p><b> 2 peeled carrots <br> 2 peeled onions <br> 1 stick celery <br> 1 clove <br> 4 cardamom pods, cracked <br> 1 bayleaf <br> 50ml white wine <br> The breastbones from the bird<br></b> </p> <p>Fill the pot with ample water to cover the bird and bring to a simmer. Once bubbling, skim off any foam that rises to the surface, then put a lid on the pot and leave to cook quietly for an hour and a quarter. Turn off the heat, and leave the fowl to sit in the stock for at least half an hour undisturbed. </p> <p>The dish may be served cold or warm (my favourite is when it is just warm). Remove the chicken from the pot and keep covered while making the broth (below). There is a pimenton sauce that goes well with this, but I prefer a generous helping of a\u00efoli (then again, I would), along with some boiled waxy spuds. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Orange and cardamom parfait </b> A recipe of Josceline Dimbleby's that is very, very good.

Remove the seeds from the cardamom pods and then roughly crush the vacant pods. Add these to the egg mixture, along with the orange slush. Mix well.

  "<p>The board game, Doley, was invented by Paul Noble, one of the five artists who have won this year's Paul Hamlyn Awards. It is a game \"for three or more players over the age of 16\", who choose to be represented by one of five characters on the board, Oblivious (&amp; Other-worldly), Burnt Out, Formless &amp; Misshapen, Ineffectual, and Aimless. \"You are now a player in Doley,\" explain the rules. \"This is what happens to you. Once every two weeks you sign on and then, a couple of days later, your Giro comes. Sometimes your Giro comes in the second post, which means hanging around, watching the letterbox, waiting for the postman ...\" </p> <p>The postman has brought something much nicer for Noble and the other winners of the Paul Hamlyn Awards, Philippe Bradshaw, Jim Lambie, Hilary Lloyd and Hew Locke. Each of the five has been told that they will receive \u00a330,000, to be paid in three annual instalments of \u00a310,000 - with no strings attached. </p> <p>The Paul Hamlyn Awards are different from any other British art prize. This is no Turner, where one of the nominated artists walks away with the prize and the rest spend the next few years getting over the whole thing. The Paul Hamlyn Awards have previously been given to artists in other fields, including composers and poets, but since 1998 have been dedicated to visual arts (publisher Paul Hamlyn's daughter, Jane Hamlyn, who runs London's Frith Street Gallery, is the guiding force). </p> <p>The aim is to provide artists with a secure income with which to nurture creativity, as well as to reward achievement. This is especially welcome for artists who do not currently make a living wage from their work and so have to supplement it with other forms of employment (or, like Noble, spend years on the dole). The judges consider need as well as merit. </p> <p>For many of us, it is hard to get too tearful about the lot of young artists. British art is rarely out of the papers, the wallet of Charles Saatchi is celebratedly capacious, and if artists have to supplement their income with day jobs, so what? </p> <p>If you went to a museum in New York in the 60s and 70s, the person taking your ticket was probably a famous artist in the making (the monochrome painter Robert Ryman and Jeff Koons both worked as attendants at the Museum of Modern Art), and if you went to the legendary toy shop FAO Schwarz in the early 70s you might have been served by Robert Mapplethorpe. Going back further, in the 50s Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg were able to keep working only because they formed a business designing window displays for Fifth Avenue stores. </p> <p>Artists have been half-bourgeois, half-social outsiders ever since they won independence from traditional systems of aristocratic patronage. Artists earn almost nothing until and unless they become stars, names, figures of a certain perceived significance in contemporary art history. </p> <p>\"To be successful as an artist,\" wrote Andy Warhol with candour, \"you have to have your work shown in a good gallery for the same reason that, say, Dior never sold his originals from a counter in Woolworth's ... If a guy has, say, a few thousand dollars to spend on a painting, he doesn't wander along the street until he sees something lying around that 'amuses' him. He wants to buy something that's going to go up and up in value.\" </p> <p>There is a huge division between the handful of artists whose work is valued in this way and the rest for whom the occasional sale is less about a serious contribution to their income than a sign that they are, after all, an artist rather than a teacher or a decorator. In Britain today, there is a vast culture of making art, but most people who call themselves artists will never make an income from their work - until they were taken up by Jay Jopling's White Cube, for example, Jake and Dinos Chapman, notoriously, were penniless. </p> <p>Artists of the post-YBA generation are particularly skint. The style of new British art has changed, and these neo-conceptual artists, often with a political edge to their work, don't expect ever to sell that much. The Paul Hamlyn Awards are particularly suited to this new climate in the British art scene. But they are also prizes, a recognition of talent, and the five artists who have been rewarded this year include some of the most promising figures around. </p> <p>Philippe Bradshaw makes kinky decorations for the modern home. His art has a decadent, rococo feel, and his affinities for the 18th century were made explicit when he reproduced Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard's cheeky painting, The Swing (1767), in the Wallace Collection, as an image glimpsed in the shiny links of a screen of chains. This piece of chainmail erotica - combining the soft frilly art of Fragonard with a hard, modern material, fragmenting a historical work of art in a field of glimmer and glamour - is typical of the work Bradshaw is doing. </p> <p>Until recently, Bradshaw was, with Andrea Mason, part of a collaborative duo, Andrea + Philippe; they carried out site-specific interventions with a subversively decorative quality, on one occasion glazing abandoned wartime bunkers around the country and offering these desirable residences for sale at a phoney estate agency that they had set up in a gallery off the King's Road. \"This brick-rendered hexagonal pillbox has a flat concrete roof with jutting corners,\" went one parodic estate agent's blurb under a colour photo of a ruined military structure in south Wales. \"It is easily accessible via a brick porch entrance. Inside ... two pairs of pink panties have been casually tossed into the corner.\" </p> <p>Since 1998, however, Bradshaw has been working on his own, and his art has become increasingly sensuous and aesthetically ambitious, offering visions of sexy, voluptuous interiors. He plans to make a chain forest, in which he will project images from the story of Hansel and Gretel, and a chain waterfall with a papier-mch\u00e9 coracle. He says he will use the money to \"establish a secure studio\" and \"invest in a computer and digital editing set-up\". </p> <p>Jim Lambie is a psychedelic nostalgist. In ZOBOP (2000), a work that can be installed in any room, he covers the entire floor in groovy, concentric bands of multicoloured vinyl. The bands of colour vibrate and dance like a poster from Haight Ashbury; orange, magenta, lime green. ZOBOP suggests that changing the world begins at home, with a bit of crazy interior decor. We colour walls, we colour doors - why not floors? Do we leave floors plain (in today's anti- carpeting age) because they make the world feel more solid beneath our feet? If you lived with Lambie's Technicolor floor, would it change anything? </p> <p>Lambie's art looks back to a time when delirium was the tool of revolution and altered states of mind were actively pursued. At the same time, ZOBOP is a formally seductive work of art, evoking abstract painting. Twentieth-century art wanted to disrupt perceptions, destroy preconceptions and open up new Utopian ways of seeing things; Lambie wittily links these high ideals to hippy colours and psychedelic pop. </p> <p>Lambie, who studied at Glasgow School of Art, is one of the growing number of Glasgow-based artists who are making an international impact. Like other artists who work in the city, he combines dreaminess and wit, and his art is hugely engaging. The thing he hopes this award will give him is, he says, \"time\" - to plan and develop new work in an unrushed way. He also plans to get a proper studio. </p> <p>Hilary Lloyd is a Warholian observer of young people, their manners, preoccupations, dress. She makes videos of studied nonchalance, which she shows simply on TV monitors mounted on steel pedestals. There is a joke about sculpture, especially the forgotten art of portrait sculpture, in the way she shows her work. Her videos are portraits; they feature young people not doing much, wasting their time in stupid games, or doing less than that - Monika (2000) tries to build a house of cards; Dawn (1999) just sits in a chair in her lime-green suit. We are invited to study them, to see what we can see about them. </p> <p>Warhol is a specific rather than general source: Lloyd's pieces resemble his Screen Tests, in which an unblinking camera would watch people mercilessly as they tried to be funny or broke down and cried. Lloyd is more collaborative with her subjects, and the method of display makes her work more intimate. The monitors are at average human height, so it's as if we are seeing someone in the room with us. At the same time, it is like coming face to face with an 18th-century statue or portrait bust. </p> <p>Hilary Lloyd is radically different from the video artists who emerged in the early 90s: whereas, say, Douglas Gordon and Steve McQueen are intensely cinematic, she is resolutely small-scale, televisual and deliberately slight. </p> <p>Hew Locke recently created an installation at the Victoria and Albert Museum called Hemmed In II. Bulging, growing, bursting between porphyry pillars in the museum's vast entrance hall, it resembled a building, perhaps a bathhouse, a market or a religious building - it was hard to tell. In its organic clutter, it seemed to be a parody of the rambling V&amp;A itself. Locke's architectural jumble - made of nothing but cut-up cardboard stuck together with glue - was the unconscious of the museum spilling out, and the work of an artist who messes about at the margins of high culture. </p> <p>Born in Edinburgh, Locke went to school in Guyana and has said that when he returned to Britain he felt for the first time that he was seen as \"other\". His response has been to make art that engages with European high art, doing grotesque charcoal and pastel drawings based on Vel\u00e1zquez and Hogarth and, with Hemmed In II, confronting the V&amp;A with its jokey other, at once a celebration and travesty. Next year, he will develop further work in museums with a residency at the Horniman Museum in Forest Hill, south London. He is also developing his long-term plan to build a structure large enough for people to walk into, the Cardboard Palace. </p> <p>Paul Noble is a kitchen visionary, a brilliantly original satirist and producer of vile dreams whose work has almost nothing in common with what we think of as contemporary British art. Noble is a politically-minded artist - he is co-curator of the exhibition Protest And Survive at the Whitechapel Gallery - who communicates a detailed vision of the world through drawings, paintings and other activities. </p> <p>However, it is the drawing project he has been working on since 1995 that is Noble's most impressive achievement to date. He is the planner and administrator of Nobson Newtown, a modern British community that he has mapped out from the Nobslums to the Lidonob to the Nobjobclub. Noble's drawings resemble the work of MC Escher, logically extrapolating basic forms. These forms are the letters of a computer font he has designed - called Nobson. The town has its own history, archaeology and geology; in Introduction To Nobson Newtown, Noble recounts how it was built out of a unique stone found in the Nobhill Downs called Nobrock, which the earliest inhabitants of the area mistook for \"the fossilised remains of God's brains\". </p> <p>In fact, Nobrock consists of language. Every building in the town has what it is written in its fabric; the Nobslums, built in a pit into which raw sewage cascades, are little houses made of letters that together say \"nobslum\". In his latest book, Noble portrays Nobson in ruins - a cross between Milton Keynes and Pompeii. The fact that it is built out of language makes you feel it is full of secret meanings and that real life, too, is written according to a secret language in which history, location and politics determine who we are. </p> <p>Nobson is an image of narcissistic and tyrannical creativity - within the town Noble gives himself The Architect's House (Paul's Palace). Noble says he wants to use his award to complete Nobson Newtown - every building, with its elaborate construction, takes him six months to draw - and the money will be especially welcome as he has been surviving by paying low rent on his studio and living in a squat, but \"this is all due to change\". </p> <p>The British art scene today is full of young artists who say the last thing they want is to be the next Damien Hirst or Tracey Emin. Forget glamour and provocation; say hello to books of theory and the pursuit of idiosyncratic ends. </p> <p>It's an inevitable reaction, repeating the history of the 60s, when the glamour of Pop was rejected by the late 60s generation who turned to conceptual art that rejected the market. Yet it's a tricky business pinpointing precisely what's going on in contemporary British art. One moment, it looks as if art has returned to colour and decoration and all the things conceptual artists are supposed to hate; the next, young artists are all political, dry-as-dust thinkers - the tendency reflected in Intelligence: New British Art 2000 at Tate Britain. </p> <p>The truth is, the best artists around now are developing obscure, even eccentric lines of thought that are not connected to any movement or fashion; Paul Noble is one of these major talents, and if there were a first prize in the Paul Hamlyn Awards it should go to him. The unstarry, unpressured Paul Hamlyn Awards are perfectly suited to this mood, encouraging artists not to worry about anything - except making art </p> <p> <strong> Philippe Bradshaw</strong> born 1965 <br></p> <p> From Lincolnshire.

Lambie will soon take up a residency at the World Trade Centre, New York. </p> <p><strong> Hew Locke </strong> born 1959 <br> </p> <p> Born in Edinburgh, educated in Guyana and now lives in London.
