  "Growing numbers of desperate local education authorities are recruiting staff from the other side of the world this year to fill a record number of unfilled teaching jobs. <p>More than 20 Australians will start work in schools in Croydon, south London, on Monday, with a further 15 expected to fly to Britain to fill posts before the year's end. </p> <p>The teachers were appointed through a recruitment drive dubbed Operation Kangaroo, in which four Croydon headteachers took the unusual step of flying to Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide to interview around 100 teachers over two weeks in July. It was a last ditch attempt to fill around 40 jobs which had remained vacant after several months. </p> <p>In a parallel move, nearby Greenwich, in south-east London, is scouring Canada and Australia for new recruits, and has not ruled out the prospect of looking in New Zealand, South Africa and parts of Europe. Similarly, Hackney, in east London, is looking in New Zealand, Australia and also, significantly, in Dubai and South Africa to boost the number of its ethnic minority teachers. </p> <p>Both Croydon and Greenwich councils used Britain's largest private recruitment company TimePlan, which has eight overseas offices, to overcome the problem of attracting applicants from this country. Any trips abroad are funded by TimePlan, solocal council taxpayers do not have to foot the bill. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said yesterday that TimePlan was currently seeking around 1,000 staff from overseas for long term postings in the UK. \"There is a great deal of interest in what we are doing,\" she said. \"We expect to announce further councils who are looking overseas in the next few weeks.\" By the time a council contacts TimePlan, it has usually exhausted other means of recruiting teachers. </p> <p><b> Fully qualified</b><br> </p> <p>The Australian staff will be employed by the local education authorities on a supply basis for two terms, after which the schools are free to take on the teachers on their own pay scales. They are only taken on if they are fully qualified, and take part in an induction programme before setting foot in the classroom. </p> <p>Most hold Australian bachelor of education qualifications and were interviewed at length about their teaching experience, knowledge of the curriculum and classroom management. Australian teachers are an attractive option for English schools as the two countries share a very similar curriculum at both primary and secondary level. The literacy hour is familiar to all Australian teachers and there is no language barrier. </p> <p>In Croydon, the 23 teachers were welcomed at a mayoral reception this week. They will teach subjects including English, drama, maths and science in 21 primary and secondary schools in the area. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Croydon council explained: \"We realised some time ago that we were struggling to attract applicants throughout the borough. The teachers have signed contracts to stay for a minimum of three terms and it has been agreed that if for any professional reason the teachers or heads are unhappy with the arrangement the teacher in question will be found a position in another school. </p> <p>\"During interviews we found many of the teachers found the idea of working so close to London a real attraction. They love the idea of teaching and getting the chance to see one of the world's most famous capitals at the same time.\" </p> <p>Councillor Lousia Woodley, Croydon council's education spokeswoman, said: \"We are delighted to have welcomed the first group of teachers from Australia. The recruitment programme has been extremely successful and has meant that our pupils will receive good quality education from qualified and experienced teachers from the start of the autumn term. </p> <p>\"We are currently working on an overall strategy for the borough which will address both the short term and the long term issues. Clearly we recognise that in some cases this project will not provide a long term solution but it will ensure that our pupils continue to receive good quality education from qualified and experienced teachers while a long term solution is found.\" </p> <p>Ironically, Australia also has a teacher shortage, along with the rest of the commonwealth and Europe. But many qualified Australian teachers recognise the value of a portable skill which they can take around the world to enhance their professional development. </p> <p>In Greenwich, the council is still looking to fill around 60 jobs, about 40 less than at the start of the summer term. </p> <p>\"We are hoping that in the short term, the recruitment drive in Canada at the beginning of August will fill most of these, and this will be followed by recruitment in Australia for January,\" a spokeswoman said. \"In the longer term the increased number of people joining the government's Graduate and Registered Teacher Programme and investment in part-time and returning teachers will increase the teachers available to the borough. </p> <p>Ralph Tabberer, chief executive of the Teacher Training Agency, said there was a valuable role for young teachers from the other side of the world, provided they met British standards. \"These are young, energetic people who can offer a different perspective on life in another country to our young people. Provided they are fully qualified, we don't have a problem with them at all.\" </p> <p>The deputy head of a Hackney secondary school said yesterday: \"We regularly use Australian teachers through supply agencies and we welcome them with open arms. They are lively and cheerful and the kids love them. They may be here primarily to see London but they also take their work extremely seriously, turning up with their own lesson plans and making sure they are doing what the school requires. It's easy to be disparaging about these youngsters but they are extremely on the ball.\" </p> <p><b> Record vacancies</b><br> </p> <p>Official figures will be published next month showing that total teacher vacancies in January were 1,020 in London and a record 1,890 elsewhere in England, though many vacancies will have been filled since the beginning of the year. </p> <p>Applications for places on teacher training courses have risen markedly since the government announced the introduction of new \u00a36,000 training salaries for those starting postgraduate teaching courses this month, but colleges are still struggling to fill their places and are running at only 75% capacity. </p> <p>David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"It is an absolute scandal that in the year 2000, an advanced industrial country like England should have to go to the old colonies to recruit teachers that we simply can't find from within our own resources because we don't give the profession the recognition it deserves. The market for good graduates is so competitive that unless the government is more radical with its ideas, it is always going to be outmanoeuvred by other professions which are recruiting the graduates we need in teaching.\" </p> <p> </p> <p><b>'It's great that teaching has enabled me to travel a bit too'</b><br><br> Australian Lisa Blanch had no hesitation in swapping the sunshine of Melbourne for the grey skies of Croydon to spend a year in a classroom in England. </p> <p>The one-year contract could not have come at a better time for Lisa as it has enabled her to accompany her husband, who is about to start postgraduate studies at a London college. </p> <p>Lisa, 32, will start work on Monday at Winterbourne junior girls' school in Croydon. She was one of 23 Australian teachers starting in the borough's classrooms next week, who were officially welcomed by the mayor at a reception this week. </p> <p>\"I've never been to England before and it is very exciting to be here,\" she said. \"My husband is doing a master's degree in economic history at the London School of Economics for a year so it has worked out perfectly for us. I have always enjoyed teaching and it has been great that it has enabled me to travel a bit too\". </p> <p>Lisa was interviewed for the post by a team of four Croydon heads who flew out to Australia this summer to interview prospective teachers. She has nine years experience, including two spent teaching on a Pacific island and, more recently, a spell of supply teaching in Melbourne. </p> <p>\"It seems that teachers carry a pretty heavy workload over here and it will be interesting to see how it compares with our jobs back home\" she said. </p> <p>\"The reception for us at the town hall was pretty amazing and it was the first time in my whole life that I have been given such a warm welcome for being a teacher. There seems to be a lot of interest in who we are and what we are doing here, which I had not expected. But everyone here is really friendly\". </p> <p>Lisa said she was surprised at the high property prices and rents, but that she and her husband hoped to be able to rent somewhere in Forest Hill, south-east London, convenient for both of them and where she is currently staying with friends. Like the other teachers, she is employed on a casual rate. Without the job, she would not have been granted a visa. </p> <p>She said her induction course had made her realise the many similarities between England and Australia, both in terms of teaching style and content. </p> <p>\"The two countries have much more in common than many people realise,\" she added. \"I haven't visited the school yet, but I am really looking forward to my first day in the classroom.</p>",
  "By the end of the second world war the ultra-orthodox Jewish sect of Bobov from Galicia, in southern Poland, had been all but wiped out by the Nazi Holocaust. Virtually single-handedly Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam, who has died aged 92, revived it. He became perhaps the most loved and respected leader of the Hassidic world. <p>More than 100,000 people lined New York's streets for his funeral. Many in the entourage owed him their lives. Today, Bobov claims 120,000 members internationally. Many live near the rabbi's majestic headquarters in Brooklyn's Borough Park. Others populate outposts dotted throughout the United States, Israel and Europe - including London's Stamford Hill. </p> <p>Rabbi Shlomo was renowned for his acts of charity for both Jewish and non-Jewish causes, his Talmudic learning, and his love of life - what he described as \"the child in me\". Well into his 80s he danced with the sacred scrolls during Simchat Torah (the Joy of the Law festival). On Sukkot (the Feast of Tabernacles) he would exhort violinists to perform niggunim (melodies to \"cleanse the soul\") composed by his late father and previous Bobover Rebbe, Ben Zion Halberstam. And each year he presided over a Broadway-style purimshpiel, the ribald revue held on the Festival of Queen Esther. </p> <p>The Rebbe - an honorific Hassidic title - certainly cut a regal figure. Each Sabbath he wore his black velvet and silver-brocaded kaftan and huge furshtreimel (hat), his genial face framed by long sidelocks and a full beard. What a contrast, then, with the clean-shaven young partisan that Shlomo briefly became during the war. </p> <p>In July 1941 Nazis overran Lvov in the Soviet Union, to which the Halberstam clan had fled from Galicia two years earlier. The SS clubbed to death his father, the Rebbe, his mother, Chaya, and most of his siblings. Somehow Shlomo escaped with his son, Naftali - but his wife and all his other children died in the camps. </p> <p>The experience devastated his faith. He shaved off his beard, and masqueraded as a Polish officer and even as a nun, to save Jews from the Nazis. He allegedly smuggled hundreds to freedom in false-bottomed coal trucks. </p> <p>In 1946 Shlomo arrived in New York via Italy and England. He settled in Borough Park in the 1960s. As his faith revived, so did his zeal to recreate the destroyed world of \"Torah-true\" Orthodoxy, and transplant it to the New World. He would greet Holocaust survivors as they arrived in New York harbour; and helped many a refugee attend trade school and find work. </p> <p>He eventually remarried and had six more children. He also developed housing, kindergartens, schools, synagogues and Talmud academies as his father had done in eastern Europe. In 1958 he visited Israel and founded the Kiryat Bobov quarter near Tel Aviv. In 1962 he established a Bobov foothold in Stamford Hill; and proudly oversaw the installation of his son-in-law, Dayan Ben-Zion Blum, as head of a much expanded community in 1984. </p> <p>Boundlessly energetic, Shlomo had a penchant for fund-raising. New York politicians paid regular visits to his Brooklyn tisch (court), to attract his community's \"bloc vote\", and learn the concerns of Orthodox Jews. But his vision of the American dream was no assimilationist melting pot. Yiddish is spoken in Borough Park; Bobover fathers choose their daughters' husbands-to-be; and work ceases for the Sabbath. </p> <p>Shlomo was a direct descendant of Rabbi Chaim Ben Leibush, who founded the Sanz Hassidic dynasty in the mid-19th century. Over time the dynasty split up into sects, pre-eminent of which was the Bobova. Unlike the Lubavich Hassidim of New York's Crown Heights, Bobovers do not proselytise amongst other Jews. None the less, thousands of ba'alei teshuva (returnees to faith) joined Bobov because of its ecstatic devotion, impressive architectural structures and reputation for caring. These newcomers, plus the Bobovers' astounding birth-rate (most families boast more than 10 children), turned a minuscule sect into the third largest in New York. </p> <p>In 1997 the outside world intruded. Bobov Yeshiva's president was indicted on charges of laundering more than $750,000 in Colombian drug money through the sect's accounts. Another nine Bobov associates admitted guilt in 1998; one local business magnate was fined $6.3m and incurred a prison sentence. Shlomo knew nothing of this state of affairs; yet the scandal damaged his community's reputation, and raised questions about his stewardship. </p> <p>For the most part, though, he enjoyed remarkably intimate relations with his subjects. He remembered the name of every Bobover schoolchild, it was said. Some even claimed he could exorcise dybbuks (troubled spirits). Under his conciliatory and compassionate tutelage, Bobovers experienced none of the internecine strife so prevalent in other Hassidic sects and his community co-existed amicably with other Brooklyn Hassidim. </p> <p>His son, Naftali, succeeded him as Bobover Rebbe. He is survived by two sons, five daughters and many grandchildren. <br><br> \u0095 Shlomo (Solomon) Halberstam, Rebbe of the Bobover Hassidim, born 1908; died August 2 2000</p>",
  "The home secretary, Jack Straw, yesterday faced another high court defeat over the treatment of a failed asylum seeker who is suing the Home Office for malicious prosecution after being cleared of taking part in detention centre riots at Campsfield House, near Oxford, in August 1997. <p>Mr Justice Elias ruled that Mr Straw had \"failed to give adequate and satisfactory reasons\" for refusing John Quaquah, from Ghana, exceptional leave to remain in the UK while he prepared his case. It is the second time the high court has told the home secretary that he has erred in law over Mr Quaquah, 35. </p> <p>The judge said it was a case where the secretary of state was himself under challenge in Mr Quaquah's civil action for damages for malicious prosecution. The decision would \"significantly affect\" Mr Quaquah's interests. He refused an application to make Mr Straw pay punitive legal costs.</p>",
  "An illegal immigrant was seriously injured yesterday and two others suffered broken legs after smuggling themselves on to a freight train through the Channel tunnel. <p>Eurostar has launched an inquiry into the incident after police found 13 men near the tracks at the Folkestone tunnel entrance. One of the victims underwent emergency treatment in hospital after suffering serious head injuries. </p> <p>The men - all believed to be from Bangladesh - are thought to have boarded a UK-bound freight train in Belgium and jumped off as it emerged in England. The train travels through the tunnel at speeds of 60-90 mph. </p> <p>Eurostar was forced to suspend train services between London and Paris for two and a half hours while police searched the area for more suspects. </p> <p>Kent police said officers were called to the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone at 8.30am after 10 men were seen at the freight train checking-in area, Dollands Moor, near the tunnel entrance in Kent. The group was found after a search of the tunnel site. The 10, who were not injured, were taken to the immigration screening service in Dover. </p> <p>Shortly afterwards, a further two men from the same group were found lying in agony on the ground where they had fallen from a 12ft fence as they tried to escape. They were taken to William Harvey hospital in Ashford. </p> <p>At 9am officers found a 13th man lying unconscious in a pool of blood on the railway line close to the tunnel, with serious head injuries. </p> <p>Police said he had fallen from the train as the others had jumped off and had hit his head on the tracks. </p> <p> It is thought the other immigrants had left him on his own as they tried to escape. Last night he was being treated in intensive care at the William Harvey hospital. </p> <p>Jane Walker, a spokeswoman for Kent holice, said: \"It appears [the immigrants] tried to get off the freight train as it was coming from France but they did not get off actually in the tunnel. </p> <p>\"One man was found near the main line with serious head injuries. Two others appeared to have been injured. They will all be handed over to immigration officials. </p> <p>\"Our only involvement after this will be to see if a crime has been committed to the man who was found seriously injured.\" </p> <p>Shuttle services resumed at 10am and passenger services restarted at 11.20am but there continued to be delays due to a backlog of trains. </p> <p>The incident has raised fears that the recent crackdown in Calais to stop refugees getting on to the back of lorries bound for Britain is forcing illegal immigrants on to the trains. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Freight Transport Association, Geoff Dossetter, said: \"Truck drivers and operators are trying to do all they can to stop illegal immigrants getting into Britain. </p> <p>\"Since Calais has clamped down there have been growing fears that asylum seekers will use the freight trains as a means of getting into the country.\" </p> <p>An immigration service spokesman said last night that none of the 13 men had formally claimed asylum. </p> <p>Bill Dix, Eurotunnel's deputy managing director, said the company was reviewing the train's route to establish exactly how the men got on. </p> <p>\"No transport system in the world is 100% able to ensure illegal travellers don't board,\" he said. </p> <p>He said security on the trains was primarily the responsibility of the French and Belgian authorities and was not Eurotunnel's role.</p>",
  "Germany is experiencing another disturbing wave of racially inspired violence and murder. At various moments in its post-war history the country has seen neo-Nazi groups winning, and losing, support. Now they are on the upsurge again with a series of killings among blacks and other minorities as well as arson attacks on asylum-seekers' hostels. A few of these incidents can be put down to drunken hooliganism by individuals, but there is mounting evidence that they stem from an organised sub-culture of racist nationalism and homophobia. Much of it can be traced to the nationalist party, the NPD, and particularly its youth wing. Headquartered in western Germany, it has made a big effort to recruit in the east, where social alienation and youth unemployment have remained high since unification a decade ago. The NPD youth wing's papers specifically call for the setting up in eastern Germany of \"free spaces where we practically take power and can administer punishment to deviants and enemies\". The technique, they say, is to mount shows of force through street demonstrations which go unchallenged. <p>Echoes of the 1930s are all too alarming and it is right that Germany's establishment has begun to take the issue seriously. The life sentence given this week to the leader of a group of youths who kicked a Mozambican to death sends a powerful signal, as do the nine-year terms for his 16-year-old accomplices. Chancellor Schr\u00f6der's visit to lay a wreath at the murder site was equally significant. In democratic countries politicians frequently fail to join the fight against racism, arguing that it is best left to the courts. This may be acceptable when racist acts are rare, but when they become frequent and widespread it is vital for governments to give a political lead. By the same token the German government is right to have started talks with the other political parties for an approach to the constitutional court to ban the NPD and its youth wing. Bans should be a last resort. They pose major civil liberties problems and can drive groups underground without weakening them. But the evidence is that Germany's racists rely on street activity for their recruitment, so that prohibition would have an effect. The debate provoked by court hearings on a constitutional ban would also help to remind Germans that racism is no marginal matter. It needs to be fought, not ignored or wished away.</p>",
  "First you serialise the gross inaccuracies of Norman Finkelstein's The Holocaust Industry and now you publish the astonishing revisionism of Tim Luckhurst (The plucky Swiss, September 1). <p>He writes that Switzerland \"did not persecute or deport Jews\". Yet under Dr Heinrich Rothmund, director of police, practically every Jew illegally entering Switzerland during 1939-44 was pushed back across the border, arrested by the waiting Gestapo and dispatched to their deaths. In 1942, only 9,150 foreign Jews lived in Switzerland, just 980 more than in 1931. Rudolph Kastner's negotiations to save some Hungarian Jews were in 1944 - after the government reversed its policies. By then, tens of thousands of Jews had been expelled and murdered. The Swiss kept their money. </p> <p><b>Tom Bower<br> London</b></p>",

  "<p><strong>An Unspeakable Betrayal: Selected Writings of Luis Bu\u00f1uel </strong> translated by Garrett White (California, 266 pp., \u00a317.50, 20 April, 0 520 20840 4 )<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502364043,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>\"Studio Vingt-Huit - high up a winding street of Montmartre, in the full blasphemy of a freezing Sunday; taxis arriving, friends greeting each other, an excitable afternoon audience.\" The description is Cyril Connolly's, the occasion a showing of Luis Bu\u00f1uel's first film, Un Chien andalou. The audience seemed baffled at the end, and some of its members were angry, unprepared no doubt for what Connolly called the \"destructive reverence\" of the film. \"With the impression of having witnessed some infinitely ancient horror, Saturn swallowing his sons, we made our way out into the cold of February 1929, that unique and dazzling cold.\"</p> <p>Connolly's sense of the horror of the work, and of its romance (\"Un Chien andalou brought out the grandeur of the conflict inherent in romantic love, the truth that the heart is made to be broken, and after it has mended, to be broken again\"), led him to ignore its farcical aspects, its echoes of Buster Keaton and its complementary truth that romantic love is as often as not a matter of violent grabs and dashes, a pantomime of lust wagging its human puppets. But his experience anticipated that of thousands of others. The first film we see by any major director usually makes a mark, but we don't always feel we have seen Saturn swallowing his sons. </p> <p>The first Bu\u00f1uel film seen by most people of my generation who were not film-club addicts was probably Viridiana (1961). After two Surrealist films made in France (Un Chien andalou and L'Age d'or, 1930), and an astonishing documentary made in Spain (Las Hurdes, 1932), Bu\u00f1uel's career was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War. He spent some time in the United States, then in 1946 settled in Mexico, where he made 18 films, of which only Los Olvidados (1950) got any real notice. Viridiana was made in Spain under Franco, and caused a tremendous scandal. After that Bu\u00f1uel made one more film in Spain (Tristana, 1970), two more films in Mexico (The Exterminating Angel, 1962, Simon of the Desert, 1965), and six films in France (Diary of a Chambermaid, 1964, Belle de jour, 1966, The Milky Way, 1969, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, 1972, The Phantom of Liberty, 1974, That Obscure Object of Desire, 1977). </p> <p>Viridiana has a number of startling and now famous images - a small crucifix flicks open to become a menacing knife; riotous, feasting beggars compose themselves into a parody of Leonardo's Last Supper, a snatch of Handel's 'Hallelujah Chorus' blaring in the soundtrack - and a ferocious implied argument about charity. All charity which is less than infinite leaves the world unchanged, and what charity is not less than infinite? Yet the most memorable feature of Viridiana, I think, is not its imagery or its argument but the harsh, reckless intelligence behind it, its manifest intention to disturb us beyond repair. Bu\u00f1uel used to say in lectures and interviews that his films are designed to show us that we don't live in the best of worlds. They certainly do that, but the formulation is not strong enough. Whatever we think about the world we live in, Bu\u00f1uel wants to send us home from the cinema feeling rattled and uncomfortable. This feeling, mysteriously, is not incompatible with being highly amused, but then the very idea of amusement seems troubling. \"Viridiana, at heart, is a humorous film,\" Bu\u00f1uel says in a typescript published in An Unspeakable Betrayal, but immediately adds that the humour is \"corrosive\". </p> <p>A few months after seeing Viridiana for the first time, I was in Spain, and met a charming man, a doctor, who claimed to know Bu\u00f1uel intimately, and to have helped him recruit the beggars for that film. I can't remember whether I believed him or not. Probably I did. Bu\u00f1uel for me was as distant as Cervantes or Saint Teresa, and I didn't even know where he lived. Then I forgot about the encounter, except for thinking kindly of the doctor and Madrid whenever I saw Viridiana again, or when my mind turned to Spain. And with time I certainly ceased to believe in the story. The doctor was entitled to his fantasy, after all; Bu\u00f1uel was the kind of figure who attracted legends and anecdotes. Then some 13 years later I saw The Phantom of Liberty. </p> <p>Right at the beginning of the film a group of Spanish prisoners is led out to be shot by Napoleon's soldiers. They include Bu\u00f1uel himself, as a monk; Serge Silberman, Bu\u00f1uel's producer; and the writer Jos\u00e9 Bergam\u00edn, an old friend of Bu\u00f1uel's. They also include the uncannily familiar figure of my old acquaintance the doctor, Bu\u00f1uel's pal Jos\u00e9-Luis Barros. It took me a while to place the recognised face, and of course I didn't fill in all the details even then. A few years later I met Bu\u00f1uel in Mexico. He was delighted when I told him the story - he loved coincidences - and thought it would have been even better if Barros and I had turned out to be long-lost twins, perhaps identified by a birthmark. I hang onto that moment in the cinema because when I saw the film and found the face I realised I had caught a piece of lost time. Not only Madrid and Dr Barros and an earlier self, but Viridiana as it felt when I first saw it: blasphemous, brilliant, ragged, indifferent to the preoccupations of unity and coherence which most aesthetics demand - Saturn swallowing a daughter. </p> <p>If I had been less devoted to the notion of the death of the author I might have got more out of my encounters with Bu\u00f1uel himself. But I'm not sure. He was so courtly and entertaining, so willing to treat me as a new-found friend rather than a nosy writer, that I had real difficulty in thinking about our conversations as material. Material for what? For the book about his films I was trying to write, or the biography I had no intention of writing? The anecdotes he told were the ones he usually told, often ones I'd already read somewhere: his stock of stories. He was a 78-year-old famous man, he had his best memories organised, he had shaped them into tales, and he was soon to put them in a book called My Last Breath (1982), which he wrote in collaboration with his scriptwriter Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re. </p> <p>Didn't I gather rich insights into the films? Some, but not as many as you might think. This was manifestly the Bu\u00f1uel who made Bu\u00f1uel's films, there were plenty of continuities between the mind I'd met in the work and the mind I was meeting over drinks. The author was fully alive in that sense, and discussing his films with Bu\u00f1uel was a delight. But I didn't understand the films a whole lot better for talking to him, and any language I might find for writing about the films was going to be quite different from the language in which I could describe him, if I was even going to try to describe him. A person is not a film, and films have all kinds of adventures once the director has finished editing them. \"I don't believe one's life can be confused with one's work,\" Bu\u00f1uel says in the book I've just mentioned. </p> <p>What I did get from meeting Bu\u00f1uel, apart from much pleasure and laughter, was a feeling for the kind of artist he was, the peculiar mixture of austerity and mischief he brought to the cinema. You can see this in the films as well, of course, but there is so much else in them, so much obsession and yearning, so much appetite for pain, so much unappeased theology. All this must have been in the person somewhere, certainly, but it wasn't in the person you met. He had trained himself, I believe, to save his nightmares for his movies. What was left in daily life was a curious mind and an imagination always playing with possibility, but above all his craft and his career, the sense of film as an art and a discipline, a kind of experiment in which even the wildest jokes took on a certain aspect of rigour or purity. </p> <p>I met Bu\u00f1uel in July 1978, through an old friend, Santiago Genov\u00e9s, a Mexican anthropologist. Santiago, born in Spain, always called Bu\u00f1uel Don Luis, and after a bit of practice, so did I. I saw him a number of times in company over the next three years, and I had many conversations with him in the late afternoons. The last time I saw him was in June 1981. I didn't go back to Mexico for a while after that, and he died in July 1983. </p> <p>First impressions. He is old, bent, has rather crooked teeth, large intelligent eyes behind heavy glasses. An amiable, mischievous grin resides almost constantly on his face. He is very deaf, but can hear if you speak loud and clear, although communication is always a little uncertain, apt to misfire or lose its sequence. A small terrier called Tristana trots in and sits on the sofa. Don Luis, the scourge of actors and actresses, can't get her to move or leave. \"I am a monk,\" he says, \"I don't go out.\" It's largely true. The world comes to him, insofar as he allows it to. But it doesn't come much or often. He says he feels old, that he was \"formidable\" between 40 and 60, and felt fine in his 60s. Now he can't remember the name of the pills he's supposed to take for his diabetes, he starts to do a sum and can't remember what he has just multiplied by what. He feels dizzy at times. He says all this with genuine impatience and distaste, but also with an energy which comes out as a kind of unshakable gaiety. </p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel likes some contemporary directors, but not many. American films, he says. Woody Allen. Stanley Kubrick. \"That film with those shots of the man's eye.\" \"A Clockwork Orange?\" \"That's the one.\" Nice thought, coming from the man whose film career began with the image of an eye slashed by a razor. Bu\u00f1uel tells me a Hitchcock story, which he tells again in My Last Breath. There is a dinner in Bu\u00f1uel's honour at George Cukor's house in Hollywood in 1972. Fifteen famous directors are there, including John Ford, Rouben Mamoulian, Robert Mulligan, George Stevens, Robert Wise, William Wyler, Billy Wilder. Hitchcock sits next to Bu\u00f1uel, says very little, then at one point puts an arm round his companion's shoulder and says with deep admiration: \"Bu\u00f1uel, that wooden leg in Tristana. That wooden leg.\"</p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel and his wife Jeanne lived in a small and tidy house in the southern central part of Mexico City, the place Bu\u00f1uel called \"this metropolis without end\". Both had become Mexican citizens in 1949. The street was a quiet cul-de-sac off a busy thoroughfare; the house had a small enclosed garden. \"Come and see me when you like,\" Bu\u00f1uel would say, \"but telephone first to set up a time.\" I would telephone, talk to Jeanne, and ask if I could see Don Luis. She would consult him, and he would invariably say: \"How about tomorrow around five?\" So I learned not to call if I couldn't go the next day. </p> <p>Generally I would watch a film of his at the Mexican Cineteca and then drive over to his house. I would say, \"I saw El today, or Robinson Crusoe,\" or whatever I had seen, and he would say: \"Terrible film, the director should be shot.\" I would murmur in polite disagreement, and ask him a question about the work. One day I said I had very much liked a French film he had made in Corsica, Cela s'appelle l'Aurore (1955). \"Yes,\" he said. \"I liked it when I made it.\" He didn't care for technical queries, and I discovered that general questions, critics' questions, didn't interest him, that he didn't want to discuss ideas or meanings. But he would talk about all kinds of things, if you could get him started on the right sort of detail - the ostrich in close-up at the end of The Phantom of Liberty, say, the garrulous duel between Jansenist and Jesuit in The Milky Way. He even loved ideas. He just didn't like the idea of them. </p> <p>One day I didn't offer my polite disagreement. I had been to see his A Woman without Love (1951), a version of Maupassant's novel Pierre et Jean, a truly terrible film by any standards, without a single redeeming or even interesting moment, as far as I could see. In My Last Breath, Bu\u00f1uel was to say this was \"no doubt my worst film\", but I didn't then know that he thought that. A number of Bu\u00f1uel's Mexican works are jagged and uneven, but virtually all of them have luminous features, touches that reveal the quirky or reckless hand of the master. Not this one. I said I didn't think the director should be shot but the film was awful, and asked what happened.</p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel nodded, remembering. Finally he said: \"I couldn't think of anything\" - \"No se me occuri\u00f3 nada,\" literally \"nothing occurred to me\". He couldn't think of anything? Yes, he knew the film was boring from the start but assumed something would occur to him while he was shooting, some gag or angle or twist that would liven it up. That was how he worked, and almost always something occurred to him. There is a little fable about art here. You plan carefully, and you leave room for inspiration, in fact you rely on its arrival. But then inspiration, always an uncertain dancing partner, fails to show up, and you just keep going and finish the job. Then you make another plan. </p> <p>I was then rather keen on the idea of Bu\u00f1uel as a permanent Surrealist, of Surrealism as a continuing state of mind, and so was slightly shocked to hear him place the movement so firmly in the past. \"When I was a Surrealist\", he said, and \"in the days of the Surrealists\" - as if the group was a club or a team you could join or leave. He was right, of course, Surrealism was always a thinner, more privileged form of revolt than it liked to imagine it was - or than I liked to imagine it was. The bourgeoisie revolting against the bourgeoisie, Bu\u00f1uel said in My Last Breath. But there is a continuing mentality, too, which has to do not with shock or rebellion but with resistance to settled or predictable meanings: resistance to interpretation itself, if by 'interpretation' we mean not just trying to make sense of things but succeeding in doing it. </p> <p>Early in our first conversation we spoke about That Obscure Object of Desire, then a recent film, which was to be Bu\u00f1uel's last. This work, notoriously, has two actresses playing a single role, that of the taunting, endlessly desired Conchita, the role played by Marlene Dietrich (on her own) when Sternberg made The Devil Is a Woman, his film based on the same novel. There is a single fictional character, with a name and a mother and a place in the plot, and indeed a single voice on the soundtrack, that of Carole Bouquet. On the screen, though, we see Carole Bouquet alternating with Angela Molina. They look quite different, although audience reactions to this trick have varied immensely: some people haven't noticed it, and some haven't been able to take their minds off it, and many have had reactions situated somewhere in between. The point, for most viewers, is to make meaning out of the alternation. The point for Bu\u00f1uel was to defeat meaning. There was to be nothing psychological about the switches, he said to me, no Jekyll and Hyde story, only random alternation. </p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel's films are full of touches like this, there to scramble old meanings, not to provide new ones, and they could have been fuller of them. Bu\u00f1uel himself was proud of the idea of the two actresses but was ready to agree that it was crazy - he had started shooting, in Paris and Madrid, with one actress, Maria Schneider, and when he fired her thought the production was over - but Serge Silberman, his producer, took to the suggestion instantly. Unlike Oscar Dancigers, the producer of Los Olvidados, who had persuaded Bu\u00f1uel to take a series of similar moves out of the film: a full symphony orchestra playing in a building under construction, a glossy top hat briefly glimpsed on a stove in a Mexico City hovel. </p> <p>Most viewers would miss these moments, Bu\u00f1uel thought, and those who saw them would wonder what they had seen, just as we wonder, in That Obscure Object of Desire, whether we have really seen two actresses or weirdly misremembered just one. Dancigers's view, which Bu\u00f1uel accepted in practice without agreeing to the principle, was that the director was ruining the film. \"I don't care if I ruin films,\" Bu\u00f1uel said. This could be a motto for him: when he is lucky, his films are the ruins of films he didn't want to make. </p> <p>My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary at the Bu\u00f1uels' house in 1978. There were a number of guests, much festivity, champagne, many Spanish jokes. Everyone had a good time, and I had a small illumination. This orderly, good-humoured house, these kindly people: isn't there something odd here? Only what Bu\u00f1uel has taught us to find odd. We are the people who managed to have a meal together, unlike the characters in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie. When the meal is over, we shall be able to leave (we were able to leave), unlike the characters in The Exterminating Angel. Bu\u00f1uel himself is not outside the world he criticises, he is part of it, and so are his friends and family. Social arrangements are foolish and apparently fragile, because they are so arbitrary and groundless. Everything about them could be different, and is different in other times and places. </p> <p>\"Everyone is a barbarian for someone,\" as a character says in The Phantom of Liberty: \"on est toujours le barbare de quelqu'un\". And yet it is because these arrangements are arbitrary and groundless that we have so little purchase on them, and they seem so strangely unchangeable. The radical instability of things in Bu\u00f1uel's films is a wish, an act of fictional defiance, the expression of a political and moral need. Their durability in reality is their discreet and remorseless excess of charm. Bu\u00f1uel's great subject is the intimate failure of the bourgeoisie to revolt against the bourgeoisie. </p> <p>Hence Bu\u00f1uel's fondness for heretics, and stories about heretics. Heretics are not atheists, outsiders, they are believers who believe something different, they are with us and not with us. That's why we have to persecute them, or why, if we are the heretics, we get persecuted. The Milky Way, Bu\u00f1uel said, could have been made about any form of heresy, artistic, scientific, sociological. He chose religious heresies because he happened to know something about them - because of his Jesuit education, he said. Bu\u00f1uel attended a school in Zaragoza that sounds at all points identical with the school Stephen Dedalus attends in Dublin in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.</p> <p> There is something disingenuous, even mischievous, about this claim, since Bu\u00f1uel's religious preoccupations are clearly more firmly anchored than the remark suggests, more like a trauma than an option. But the intellectual reach of the idea is interesting, and says something about the intimacy of failed revolt in Bu\u00f1uel's works, from L'Age d'or through Los Olvidados, Nazar\u00edn, Viridiana, Tristana and The Phantom of Liberty. Heretics often suffer dreadfully because they are so close to the doctrine they dissent from. But then they are close to it. Even their dissent can be seen as a form of complicity, a failure to get outside the engulfing system. This is a revolt which can't escape its family of thought, which will always have been the secret friend of its worst enemy. </p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel was born in Calanda, near Teruel, in Spain, just over 100 years ago (22 February 1900), but he insisted that the place itself plunged him into an older time.\"My infancy slipped by in an almost medieval atmosphere\"; \"I had the good fortune of spending my childhood in the Middle Ages.\" One effect of this ancientness was that his films, after a certain point, stopped ageing, since they so fluently mingled contemporary violence, drugs, high-tech killers, up-to-date political jokes with much older customs. When a car hits a tree in The Milky Way, a voice comes out of the car radio preaching a sermon on the pains of hell. The text is from a work by Fray Luis de Granada, a medieval mystic. The voice is Bu\u00f1uel's. Although Bu\u00f1uel thought that film, as a medium, was peculiarly the \"victim of time\", he managed if not to refute time at least to confuse it. When the Argentinian writer Julio Cort\u00e1zar uses the word 'Bu\u00f1uel' as an adjective he means skipping without warning \"from Actium to the Anschluss\" - or as happens in L'Age d'or, from an imagined foundation of Rome to a troubled 1930. </p> <p>This is not quite the impression we get from the rather miscellaneous collection of materials in An Unspeakable Betrayal. Time's hand is all over this work, pushing everything remorselessly towards the past. The book is an English-language version of a French book published in 1995, which in turn contained work assembled in Spanish in 1982. Some of the material was even gathered in Francisco Aranda's biography of Bu\u00f1uel, published in Spanish in 1969, and available in English in 1975. </p> <p>The book opens with a selection of whimsical prose pieces Bu\u00f1uel published between 1922 and 1927. Some are Surrealist avant la lettre - Bu\u00f1uel says in My Last Breath that he wasn't much interested in Surrealism until well after he moved from Madrid, where he had studied, to Paris in 1925 - and some are literally Surrealist. The cymbals in an orchestra are said to be \"light shattered into fragments\"; a personified wind, \"howling with delight\", uproots trees, spins houses round and turns \"three priests sneaking down the street into as many inverted umbrellas\". A piece of roasted meat takes a walk, has all kinds of adventures. The least dated of these self-consciously artful pieces is perhaps 'La Sancta Misa Vaticanae', which describes a competition held in Rome to see who can say mass fastest: </p> <p>At the word 'go', the priests begin to say mass as fast as they can. Turning toward the faithful to say the Dominus vobiscum, making the sign of the cross etc, they reach incredible speeds, while the altar boy goes back and forth with the missal and the other ritual objects. A few fall down exhausted, like boxers. Finally, Mos\u00e9n Rendueles, of Huesca, is declared the winner, having said the entire mass in a record 1 minute and 45 seconds. As a prize he receives a monstrance and a large Aragonian wicker basket. </p> <p>An Unspeakable Betrayal also has the texts of a brief pre-Surrealist play called 'Hamlet', which Bu\u00f1uel put on with his friends in the cellar of the Caf\u00e9 Select in Montparnasse (\"At the end of each act, the peasants will be foreshadowed\"; \"Marquises artificially bleed to death along the nauseating walls\"), and of a rather learned lecture on the puppet theatre. The rest of the book offers a selection from Bu\u00f1uel's film criticism, a handful of more theoretical pronouncements on the cinema, some notes on three of his own films (L'Age d'or, Las Hurdes and Viridiana), some screenplays and/or synopses, including the version of Un Chien andalou which Bu\u00f1uel published in La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste in 1929, and some autobiographical jottings. </p> <p>Already in the late 1920s Bu\u00f1uel liked American films, especially the comic shorts of Ben Turpin, Harry Langdon and above all Buster Keaton. \"The finest poems that cinema has produced\", he said of American two-reelers, \"far more Surrealist than the films of Man Ray.\" \"'Keaton's films,\" Bu\u00f1uel wrote, \"give lessons to reality itself.\" He loved Dreyer's Passion of Joan of Arc (\"the humanity in these faces floods the screen and fills the room\"), and was very funny about Adolphe Menjou's moustache (\"a page of Proust brought to life on the upper lip\"). What Bu\u00f1uel has to say about film as a medium, about d\u00e9coupage and close-ups and the rest, is rather disappointing, since it seems like watered-down Eisenstein - but then we have the films. Among the later work in the volume is a set of film ideas which Bu\u00f1uel noted down some time in the 1940s (probably), and called 'Gags'. This one anticipates a moment in The Exterminating Angel: </p> <p>\"The owners of the castle and their guests, some six or seven people in all, climb the staircase of the main hall to go to bed. In the corridor on the second floor, where various doors lead to their rooms, they bid one another good night and retire. A short while later, one of the guests cautiously leaves his room on a mysterious expedition. As he approaches the staircase he hears the nearby voices of people coming up the stairs. They are exactly the same people as before, who again say good night and retire to their rooms.\"</p> <p>And this one has several echoes in Bu\u00f1uel's last films, especially The Phantom of Liberty: \"In a room, with four candles placed around it, is a coffin in which lies a very beautiful woman who might be the bride. As the protagonist draws near her, the corpse opens its eyes and says: 'Would you mind leaving me in peace?'\"</p> <p>There is also an unlikely treatment, written in English in 1937 for Paramount, for a film about Goya and the Duchess of Alba, which is so terrible that Bu\u00f1uel must have had the time of his life writing it. Goya is \"a large man, warm, passionate, yet retaining the peasant's virtues of simplicity and sincerity\". He saves the Duchess from a street escapade, but she doesn't yet know who he is. \"He leads her into the atelier where the walls are covered with paintings that are famous all through Spain. The Duchess regards them in amazement. 'You are Goya!' she exclaims. He nods.\"</p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel said of Un Chien andalou that it was \"nothing other than a desperate, impassioned call for murder\", although his misguided audiences (\"this imbecilic crowd\") kept finding it \"beautiful\" or \"poetic\". Bu\u00f1uel's sons Juan Luis and Rafael rather ungratefully repeat the charge in a brief afterword to this book. \"That's what his films and writing were all about. To provoke, to shock, to destroy a society that he found corrupt and idiotic, to ridicule a religion that had oppressed millions of people and continues to do so... Now many of his books and belongings have been put into museums.\" </p> <p>Or even reprinted in works published by university presses. We might rather say, as I think Bu\u00f1uel himself would later have said, that if an audience can mistake a call for murder for a beautiful poem, there is something wrong with the work as well as the audience. Or something wrong with the description of the work. What Bu\u00f1uel learned magnificently to do as a filmmaker was to make it impossible for us to settle for beauty and poetry, however much we liked the works. The desperate call for murder was more than a metaphor but less than a programme, a response to the pain of a world which not even the most extreme violence could alter. </p> <p>The last time I saw Bu\u00f1uel we had an extended talk about chance. I had said how much I liked the moments in Tristana where the main character forces herself or her companions to make choices between two virtually identical things, to prefer one over the other: the chickpeas on her plate, the pillars of a colonnade in a courtyard, two narrow streets in Toledo. Bu\u00f1uel said that the things are not different but you can make them different. You look at any two identical things, two copies of the same book, two objects of the same colour, and they begin to seem different. \"This red is more red.\" Then you act on this invented difference and your life changes - or it doesn't. </p> <p>This way of thinking is about as far from determinism as it could be, but it doesn't seem to afford much human freedom. Our acts would have scarcely any antecedents, we could literally go either way with the chickpeas or the streets or the books or the colours: chance masquerading as choice. But then these same acts are heavy with consequences, just as they would be if we had made fully considered choices between radically different alternatives. We create a moment of meaningless freedom and then we squander it. Or perhaps we create the momentary flicker of freedom because we know the larger options are not available to us. When Tristana chooses between two chickpeas or two pillars, she insists on the real but slight difference between the candidates: \"There's always a little something that makes me like one of them more.\" The despairing corollary to this view would be that differences as slight as this convert every choice into a self-deluding game. On the other hand, when Tristana takes the street to the right rather than to the left, she meets the man who is to become her lover. Would she otherwise have missed him?</p> <p> What we call causes, Bu\u00f1uel says in My Last Breath, are really a limitless profusion of chances. \"Chance is the great master of all things. Necessity arrives only afterwards.\" Did Bu\u00f1uel believe this? Not exclusively or always, but it was one of his favourite stories about human behaviour, and I suddenly remember that at one time he was planning to make a film of Gide's Les Caves du Vatican, a novel predicated on the notion of the acte gratuit. The acts in Tristana are gratuitous in their making, but a mere phantom of liberty in their effect. </p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/\">LRB</a>.

  "Up to 3m people will be forced to undergo DNA tests after Tony Blair unveiled plans yesterday to record the personal details of every person arrested in Britain. <p>In a move criticised by civil rights campaigners, the prime minister announced an extra \u00a3109m to ensure that DNA samples from \"virtually the entire criminally active population\" are stored on Britain's DNA database. </p> <p>Speaking to police officers in Kent, the prime minister swept aside civil rights concerns as he outlined plans to add an extra 3m samples to the existing 940,000 samples held on the police DNA database by 2004. </p> <p>\"I believe that the civil liberties argument is completely misplaced,\" Mr Blair said. \"This is using technology to catch criminals.\" </p> <p>The prime minister's plan will allow police officers to take DNA samples from any person arrested for a \"recordable\" offence, ranging from shoplifting to murder. Police already have the powers to carry out such tests but the high costs involved - each test costs \u00a340 - means that officers only tend to take DNA samples from people arrested for the most serious offences. </p> <p>One home office source said: \"The extra money will allow the police to take DNA samples from suspects at the lower end of the scale - the average burglar may leave DNA samples at several properties.\" </p> <p>Ministers believe that civil rights campaigners are wrong to object because DNA samples will be destroyed if a suspect is released without charge or is acquitted. However, DNA records of suspects who are cautioned will be kept. </p> <p>The civil liberties group, Liberty, said last night that Mr Blair's plan would increase the number of DNA samples which are allegedly held illegally by the police. Mary Cunneen, the group's associate director, said: \"The forensic science laboratory currently holds 50,000 DNA samples unlawfully. This is a clear breach of privacy for the individuals concerned and Liberty would be very interested in pursuing a judicial review.\" </p> <p>The prime minister's announcement - his first major policy initiative since returning from his summer holiday on Tuesday - was one of the highlights of the government's \"law and order week\" as ministers attempt to regain the initiative over crime. </p> <p>The home secretary, Jack Straw, launched the fightback on Wednesday when he unveiled the first national police recruitment campaign. Mr Blair will attempt to maintain the momentum in Glasgow today when he declares that all drug offenders will be forced to undergo special treatment. </p> <p>Downing Street decided to make crime the theme of the week after Labour's private polling showed that the Tories had pulled ahead on law and order in the wake William Hague's controversial interventions on asylum and the jailing of the Norfolk farmer, Tony Martin. </p> <p>One Downing Street source said ministers hoped to undermine the Tories by pointing out that expensive anti-crime initiatives, such as the new DNA tests, would be in jeopardy under the Tories because of Mr Hague's plans to impose \u00a316bn spending cuts. </p> <p>Mr Blair will attempt to reinforce his \"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\" image today when he unveils plans to force all drug offenders to undergo treatment. In a speech in Glasgow, the prime minister will say that a series of pilot projects of new drug and treatment orders show that they drastically reduce the re-offending rate. </p> <p>Offenders who escaped the treatment committed 107 offences a month. This contrasted with 10 offences from those who underwent treatment. \"Treatment orders help to break the link between drugs and crime,\" Mr Blair will say. </p> <p>The prime minister believes that extra resources can transform the fight against crime. However, he made clear yesterday that the criminal justice system would have to embrace reform. \"I think we have effec tively got a 19th century justice system in a 21st century world,\" he said. </p> <p>He criticised the court system in particular. \"It is run far too much for the convenience of the individual court,\" he said. </p> <p>However, the prime minister faced mild embarrassment when the chief constable of Kent, his host yesterday, questioned the government's police recruitment campaign. Sir David Phillips said successful policing was not just down to \"the decorative presence of a few patrolling officers\".</p>",
  "It might have been the funeral of a renowned actor, or a politician, given the 300-odd mourners outside the church, the cordoned-off roads, the bechained dignitaries, and the massed ranks of press. <p>But when the cortege, headed by a gleaming Victorian coach and four plumed horses, drew up at the village church of St Peter's in Hersham, Surrey, yesterday, it almost seemed as if they were mourning someone too young to be famous. </p> <p>The white coffin was barely four feet long, and the floral wreaths above the carriage spelt out two words now synonymous with one little girl: \"Sarah\" and \"Princess\". They were there to bury Sarah Payne, the eight-year-old snatched from a country lane behind her grandparents' home in Kingston, west Sussex, two months ago. </p> <p>Inside the packed church Sara and Michael Payne, both 31, together with their children Lee, 13, Luke, 11, and six-year-old Charlotte, grieved for the daughter they had called their \"little princess\", and mourned, in the words of the parish priest Nick Whitehead, her \"much too early death\". </p> <p>As villagers listened to the service, relayed outside on loudspeakers, the vicar, Sarah's mother, and a former teacher recalled the loving, feisty, and sometimes bossy schoolgirl. Struggling to hold back the tears, and at times breaking down, Mrs Payne read out a letter she had written to her daughter. </p> <p>\"Ever since you came bounding into our lives at two in the morning with ... one tooth in your head and a smile that could melt ice, we loved you,\" she said, to rapt silence. </p> <p> She went on: \"As a sister, you were great. You were a pain when you were supposed to be, and a great friend whenever needed. Lee misses your top chats, Charlotte, she misses you - your stories, your songs, your games, and most of all your huggles. </p> <p>\"As a daughter, my darling, you were perfect. I will always, always love you. Love always and forever, Mummy and Daddy.\" </p> <p>Her former teacher at Burhill primary school, June Whittle, was close to tears as she recalled a \"very special little girl\", who would dash into her mother's arms at the end of each day and skip off. </p> <p>The vicar, who recalled Sarah visiting the church with her school, spoke of her \"sensitive bossiness\". But he also referred to her traumatised siblings, who were were playing with her minutes before she was snatched on July 1, in Kingston, west Sussex. \"Above all, allow [them] to be themselves,\" he urged the congregation. \"Care for them and treat them as normally as possible.\" </p> <p>As the small coffin, carried by four pall-bearers, left the church for a private burial, the impossibility of a \"normal\" existence for the Payne family was all too apparent. Mr Payne clung to his wife while Charlotte clutched her arm with both hands, and the boys stood helplessly by. </p> <p>For Sussex police, now pinning their hopes on finding Sarah's blue polo dress, it was a scene that leant further impetus to their inquiries. </p> <p>\"It's impossible for us not to be emotionally involved,\" said Detective Superintendent Alan Ladley, three of whose officers joined the 21 members of the Payne family in the procession behind the cortege, at their request.</p>",
  "As the chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, paid his respects yesterday to the immigrant whose murder ignited an international scandal about Germany's neo-Nazi right, it emerged that the dead man's widow had fled her home in fear of her life and was living in hiding under police protection. <p>Three young men set upon the Mozambique-born Alberto Adriano in a park in the eastern city of Dessau on June 11 and kicked him for so long and so hard that he died from his injuries three days later. </p> <p>His murder helped jolt Germany's political leaders into a new assessment of the threat posed by the extreme right. </p> <p>Adriano's German-born wife Angelika was not in court on Wednesday for the sentencing of her husband's murderers. The eldest of the three racist thugs who attacked him was given a life sentence. His two 16-year-old accomplices got nine years each. </p> <p>John Greene, an American who represents an anti-discrimination group in Dessau, said yesterday that Ms Adriano left her home on Saturday. \"I know that she planned it after receiving threatening telephone calls. Then a letter came threatening her life and the lives of her children,\" he said. </p> <p>A leader of the immigrant community in Dessau said the writer of the letter had threatened to blow up the flat she shares with her three children, the youngest of whom is six months old. </p> <p>The letter also abused her for having married an African and said her children would be infected with Aids as a result. </p> <p>Against a background of spreading European concern about the far right, Mr Schr\u00f6der was joined yesterday by the Finnish prime minister, Paavo Lipponen, on a visit to Dessau. The visit was intended to highlight the German government's determination to curb neo-Nazism. </p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der laid a wreath of yellow flowers at the little monument which local officials have erected at the site of the murder. But, astonishingly, no arrangements were made for the chancellor to meet Mrs Adriano. </p> <p>Nor did he have any but the most fleeting contact with those working against racism in the city: he shook hands with the head of the city's multi-cultural institute. </p> <p>Nobody doubts his determination to tackle far-right violence, but he will have his hands full: xenophobia seems to be entrenched in many regions of Germany, particularly in the east. </p> <p>Heinz Wolf, a retired man, who watched Mr Schr\u00f6der lay his tribute of flowers, said he had little respect for the gesture. </p> <p>\"This won't change anything,\" he said.\"Why do we bring so many foreigners here when we have enough problems ourselves?\" </p> <p>Today Mr Schr\u00f6der will reach the end of a marathon tour of eastern Germany which has been dominated by the issue of far-right violence. Yet not a single meeting with race-relations workers has figured on his itinerary. </p> <p>Nor is there any evidence of his having discussed the issue with members of the immigrant community. </p> <p>As he visited Dessau, a new race row erupted in the state parliament in Hesse, the region which includes Frankfurt. </p> <p>The local leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) made a formal apology after Green party members claimed that a Christian Democrat MP had told a foreign-born Green MP to go back where he came from. </p> <p>They said that during a heated debate Tarek al-Wazir, who has German citizenship and a Yemeni father, was told to \"go back to Sana'a\". </p> <p>CDU members said that the phrase had been misheard, but the leader of their parliamentary group made an unconditional apology. </p> <p>Elsewhere, police in the eastern town of Cottbus reported that a group of youths shouting \"Sieg Heil\" and giving the Nazi salute had tossed two crude Molotov cocktails on to the footbpath in front of a building housing a youth club called \"Multi-cultural Europe\". There were no injuries and no damage. </p> <p>Near Stuttgart, in south-west Germany, three skinheads, ages 18 to 21, faced charges after confessing to lighting a fire in a home for asylum seekers on Wednesday. Two of the 79 residents were slightly injuring during the evacuation.</p>",
  "A serious riot in southern China has brought fresh evidence that millions of Chinese peasants are missing out on their country's new prosperity, while Beijing tries belatedly to tackle their complaints. <p>Accounts from demonstrators reaching Hong Kong claim that up to 20,000 peasants staged a protest last week which was broken up by hundreds of armed police who fired in the air. Demonstrators were said to have ransacked a government office in Yuandu township and to have assaulted local officials. </p> <p>The authorities in Feng-cheng, in Jiangxi province, have confirmed that riot police were called in to deter thousands of peasants protesting at high taxes. Jiangxi's Communist party-run daily has admitted that \"because of the burden on farmers a very serious incident occurred\". </p> <p>The incident was sparked by a ban on a booklet called The Farmers' Friend, which lists the maximum agricultural taxes allowed in theory by Beijing - but exceeded routinely in the countryside. The farmers were furious that written material which justified their complaints was suppressed. </p> <p>Vivid evidence of the heavy burden on China's peasants has also emerged from the neighbouring province of Hubei, where a local Communist party activist was so shocked by their plight that he appealed to Beijing for help. </p> <p>Li Changping, a rural district leader in Jianli county, says he wrote his appeal with tears in his eyes. He began with a simple but powerful complaint: \"The peasants are really suffering; the country is really poor; and our farming is in danger!\" </p> <p>Mr Li described a community so crippled by taxation that 15,000 out of 18,000 able-bodied farmers had abandoned their fields to seek work in the towns. \"I would rather die in the city than live on the land,\" he quoted a migrant as saying. </p> <p>The traditional flow of peasant labour to the towns had now become a blind stampede and included the very old and very young. Over 60% of the district's population had left. </p> <p>Mr Li said that tax was levied on the land regardless of crop yield, so that an average family could hardly break even. Officials routinely reported exaggerated yields to the \"higher levels\" so that the discrepancy would not be spotted. </p> <p>\"I often meet old people who seize me by the hand, weeping that they would prefer to die soon,\" Mr Li wrote to Beijing. \"Children go on their knees to me, begging [for the money] to go to school.\" </p> <p>Inland rural areas such as Jianli and Fangcheng are too far away to profit easily from the booming urban economy near the coast. </p> <p>The price for agricultural products such as grain has remained stagnant or declined, while there has been a steep rise in taxation over the past decade as local bureaucrats have become more greedy - and more numerous. Prices will fall further when China enters the World Trade Organisation, allowing easier access for US produce </p> <p>Mr Li's letter in March to the state council in Beijing has paid off, according to a report in the Southern Weekend - one of China's very few investigative newspapers which tackles these difficult subjects. </p> <p>Orders came down for taxes to be cut and officials to be sacked. More than 50 government vehicles have been sold off to replenish local funds. </p> <p>Summer grain production this year has fallen by nearly 10%, according to the ministry of agriculture. Beijing claims this is part of a \"structural adjustment\" which will eventually lead to more profitable specialised farming, but it admits that the process will be painful. </p> <p>Both Hubei and Jiangxi provinces were hit by heavy flooding from the Yangtze river and its tributaries in 1998-99, which has accelerated the flight from the land. Jiangxi is one of China's poorer inland provinces, although a new north-south railway which now passes through Fengcheng may help in the long run. </p> <p>More evidence of the rural plight comes in a new survey of peasant incomes reported this week by China's national bureau of statistics. It shows that a third of average incomes is generated by migrant labour and only a fifth by selling crops. The rest comes from rural businesses which only flourish in richer areas.</p>"
