  "The government has slashed the cost of ministerial trips abroad by \u00a31.8m a year, after it was forced by the Guardian to reveal the bills of all overseas visits over \u00a3500. <p>Figures put in the Commons library disclose that spending by cabinet ministers on trips abroad has dropped from \u00a36.4m for the first 11 months of the Labour government to \u00a34.6m for the year up to March this year. </p> <p>Among the top spending ministers who appeared to have been reined in by Labour's tougher guidelines is Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, who took 43 trips in the past year. The cost of his most expensive trip dropped from \u00a3169,186 for a five-day Far East trip in 1997, to \u00a366,080 for attending the Washington Nato summit last April. </p> <p>Last year the Guardian used John Major's open government code - the precursor of Jack Straw's freedom of information legislation - to request that the costs of all cabinet ministers' trips be released. The paper quoted a precedent set by the Queen to release all details of travel by the royal household that cost more than \u00a3500. Tony Blair acceded to the request. He also promised an annual report on the cost of ministers' trips. </p> <p>The figures up to March this year were put in the Commons library as MPs went on holiday, after a question from Derek Twigg, Labour MP for Halton. </p> <p>The drop in expenditure was also helped by a new parsimonious approach by former cabinet minister Jack Cunningham. He earned the nickname Junket Jack after spending nearly \u00a330,000 leading a delegation of officials to two Brussels agricultural council meetings, staying at five-star hotels and flying in private planes. </p> <p>His expenditure last year was one of the lowest. He claimed \u00a3672 for a trip to Rome, including an overnight stay, to discuss modernising government. </p> <p>His successor, Mo Mowlam, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, has had only one trip in her job: a three-day visit to Portugal to discuss drugs issues at a cost of \u00a3761. </p> <p>Other ministers with jet setting reputations - John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, and Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary - have also cut their expenses. </p> <p>Mr Prescott, attacked in his first year for a \u00a399,000 visit to India and for scuba diving in the Maldives as part of a \u00a36,925 trip, had six trips in the past 12 months. His most expensive was an \u00a311,906 trip to Rio de Janeiro, Brasilia, Sao Paolo, Miami and Washington. It included meetings with the directors of the Cunard cruise ship company, whom he once served as a bar steward. His cheapest trip was \u00a3940 for an overnight stay in Warsaw to discuss climate change. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson has made four trips as Northern Ireland secretary. The most expensive was \u00a35,849 for a four-day visit to Washington and Boston to explain the decision to suspend the Northern Ireland executive. The cheapest was \u00a32,094 to address a Middle East peace conference in Tel Aviv. </p> <p>Other ministers who have kept down spending include Alastair Darling, social security secretary. His most expensive, a six-day fact finding visit to the US to look at welfare to work, cost \u00a32,030. His cheapest, at \u00a3505, was an away day to Brussels to met the EU social affairs commissioner. </p> <p>One of the few ministers to have increased his foreign travelling is Jack Straw, home secretary. He took eight trips last year. His most expensive was a two-day visit to Lisbon to meet justice and home affairs ministers. His cheapest was a \u00a3548 overnight stay in Madrid to meet the interior minister. </p> <p><b>The big, and not so big, spenders</b></p> <p><b> Tony Blair</b> <br>Spent the biggest sum on a single trip - \u00a3139,775 - last November when, with 14 officials, he attended the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in South Africa. His second most expensive trip was to the Nato summit in Washington last April with 24 officials at a cost of \u00a364,350. Otherwise quite parsimonious. The bill for a seven day visit to Lisbon in January where he combined a holiday with preparations for the European Council cost just \u00a31,999 - the Blairs paid their own air fares </p> <p><b> Robin Cook</b> <br>The foreign secretary ran up the biggest bills and took record numbers of officials abroad with him. Took 20 officials to the Washington Nato summit - outspending the PM with a bill for \u00a366,080. Other big bills were a visit to Cairo last January (\u00a356,549) and a visit to Moscow and Tblisi (\u00a353,493). He saved cash by getting the Queen to subsidise his visit to Ghana and attending the Commonwealth heads of government meeting. It cost the Foreign Office \u00a34,010 for a week long trip </p> <p><b> Geoff Hoon</b> <br>The defence secretary's most expensive trip was visiting British troops in Egypt last October to watch Operation Bright Star. The bill was \u00a358,185 for him and 12 officials. He logged the cheapest expense claim for attending the Nato summit in Washington - \u00a3722 as Downing Street paid his air fare </p> <p><b> Clare Short</b> <br>The international development secretary made 17 foreign trips last year at knockdown prices. Her most expensive was \u00a39,905 to visit refugee camps in Macedonia and Albania. One of her cheapest was to address Anglican bishops in Portugal on poverty (\u00a3672) </p> <p><b> Gordon Brown</b> <br>The chancellor also kept his expenses down. His most expensive trip for him and five officials was to attend the G7 and World Bank meetings in Washington in April last year for \u00a36,615. </p> <p><b> Alan Milburn</b>, the health secretary, and <b> John Reid</b>, the Scottish secretary, cost the taxpayer nothing. They did not go abroad last year.</p>",
  "<p>In the little pidgin English he can muster, Jon says it is a year since he escaped the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. \"The day I arrived here was the day I thought: 'I know I will be OK',\" the 15-year-old says, smiling at the memory. But there is something not quite right about his smile. He is not OK. Indeed, it took over six months to get a placement in residential care and he has still not been provided with any legal advice about his future. Should he not fight for his rights? \"No,\" he says, shaking his head rigorously. \"Too scared. I should be grateful. Anyhow, I don't know what my rights are.\" </p> <p>Jon - not his real name - is one of a growing number of refugee children adrift in a care system that sometimes seems not to have their best interests at heart. \"Whether refugees are youngsters who become separated from their families in this country, or they are unaccompanied asylum seekers, few speak out about being mistreated by our care system. It's one of the reasons it is so rife,\" says Selam Kidane, newly- appointed refugee project consultant at British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering. Her role in raising awareness of how refugee children in public care are treated, has been funded by the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund as part of its attempt to help a group of people who are believed by many to live in the lap of luxury, yet whose basic requirements are often denied. </p> <p>Child care charity Barnardo's welcomes the potential focus. Its latest research reveals that the therapeutic, legal, educational, language and health needs of refugee children are often lacking, leaving them feeling alone and frightened. Likewise, the audit commission has found that many such youngsters do not receive the same care routinely offered to other children in need, despite having the same legal rights. </p> <p>So why has a nation renowned for helping victims of countries in trouble been getting it wrong? And what is being done about it? </p> <p>\"Historically, there has been very little research into the needs of refugee children,\" says Kidane. \"No research means no debate. No debate means no advocacy and no improvements. Social workers and other professionals who come into contact with refugee children are queuing up to get relevant training, but it just doesn't exist. Many don't even have awareness of asylum seekers' rights.\" </p> <p>The result, says Nicola Wyld, legal adviser to Voice for the Child in Care, a campaign group, is that experiences such as Jon's are becoming increasingly frequent. She adds: \"When refugee children are placed in care, emergency placements tend to be seen as the short-term solution. These placements often end up being extended and the young person establishes attachments, sometimes for the first time ever. </p> <p>\"Suddenly, however, the social worker finds a new placement in a community that meets the ethnic culture in question and the child is moved - sometimes out of the borough. On the face of it, this appears to be the right decision and certainly social workers have good intentions. But the reality is that the damage created by ruining their initial bonds can have a devastating effect. These are youngsters with emotional vulnerability that most of us cannot comprehend, and who are in urgent need of being treated with informed sensitivity.\" </p> <p>Barnardo's argues that this knowledge gap - coupled with lack of resources - is responsible for the fact that needy refugee children may be excluded from the care system altogether. A staggering 41% of young refugees supported by London boroughs in October last year were housed in bed and breakfast accommodation, hotels or hotel annexes. </p> <p>\"Section 17 of the Children Act states that the local authority may provide accommodation in care for 16-21 year olds if it considers that it would safeguard or promote their welfare,\" says Pam Hibbert, the charity's principal policy officer. \"Clearly, refugees fall into this category, yet this is often missed.\" She adds: \"Since our report shows that many young people arrive with no paperwork, and assessments of their age are based on guesswork, it is safe to conclude that many under-16s are also excluded from care. Indeed, some fib that they're older, thinking it will get them greater rights. This, in turn, has implications for education and health care.\" </p> <p>Since 80% of refugees who arrive in this country are aged 16-18 - and the numbers of youngsters of all ages arriving in the UK is rising faster than ever - the Refugee Council claims this is no longer an issue we can afford to ignore. \"Resources and services for refugee children, as for any child in need, should be based on a full and holistic assessment of all their needs,\" says Judith Dennis, the council's unaccompanied children policy adviser. </p> <p>Kidane claims that a severe lack of available legal advisers, as well as interpreters and translators, is largely to blame for the inability of refugee children to fight against such inadequacies. \"We intend to call on the services of such people to create a forum of young refugees who will get their views heard by policy makers,\" she says. \"It won't be easy to recruit members - particularly those from countries with oppressive regimes who have learned not to speak at all - but we are determined. We see it as the only way in which we can turn around an ugly reality.\" </p> <p>The relentless negative press that refugees have received in recent months will no doubt prove a further obstacle, Kidane fears. The refugees do not feel supported and potential service providers, from foster carers to schools, become scared to offer their services for fear of causing unnecessary controversy. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the audit commission's latest research warns that lasting improvements must be introduced urgently. It found that a mere 12% of authorities with a social services department have a refugee strategy in place, and few have any concrete plans to change that - often simply because the government's funding mechanisms are inadequate. </p> <p>\"There are alarming differences in how boroughs cope with care of these people, and support services outside London are particularly poor,\" says Shara Kulay, author of the reports. \"Fewer than half of the contracted immigration law firms are outside London, for instance. And many GPs and schools are reluctant to accept asylum seekers, especially if they impose new demands on over-stretched services.\" </p> <p>The Refugee Council agrees that time is of the essence. Dennis says: \"Refugee children should be treated as children first - and refugees second.\"</p>",
  "<p> A man who suckles on breastfeeding women, dumps on his neighbours' lawn, smashes up coke-vending machines and terrorises children and pensioners is likely, as they say on talk TV, to have a few issues to deal with. </p> <p>Charlie/Hank, the central character in Me, Myself and Irene, a new Jim Carrey blockbuster, due for release next month, has more troubles than most. Deserted by his wife and ridiculed by his community, this Rhode Island state-trooper is the proverbial nice guy until his pent-up rage turns him, according to the film's pre-publicity, \"from gentle to mental\". Diagnosed as having an \"involuntary schizoid personality disorder with narcissistic tendencies\", his dual personalities do battle for Irene's affections, wreaking havoc wherever they go. </p> <p>Funny, eh? Fans of Carrey's grimacing, scatological bad taste humour (Dumb and Dumber, Ace Ventura) will no doubt think so. The movie topped the US takings chart after its first weekend on release and, with its 15 certificate, promises to pull in the post-pubescent market here. But there is also a growing lobby of cinema-goers who fail to see the joke. </p> <p>In the US, Canada and Australia there have been widespread protests at the way Me, Myself and Irene misleadingly portrays schizophrenia as a Jekyll and Hyde, split personality disorder - and \"Hank\" as a violent threat to society - when schizophrenics are far more likely to be the victims than the perpetrators of violence. Mental health campaigners have accused the film's distributors, 20th Century Fox, of feeding all the worst prejudices about severe mental illness, whilst targeting 15 to 24 year olds, a group particularly vulnerable to the onset of schizophrenia. </p> <p>In Canada, where there have been some vicious recent attacks on homeless schizophrenics - including one killing - the criticisms have had a bitter resonance. Here, the National Schizophrenia Fellowship, Mind and other organisations have signed up to the international campaign and are targeting 300 cinemas for leafleting and local protests when the film is released on September 22. </p> <p>The NSF is not calling for Me, Myself and Irene to be banned. But it does want it to have an 18 certificate, and has complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about the film's promotional material. In other countries this has centred on \"schizo\", split-face images of Carrey, with promotional products that include jelly-bean \"pills\" claiming to cure schizophrenia. Even before the film's UK release, it looks like the protestors may have got some results. Twentieth Century Fox has said it is dropping the gentle-to-mental catchline, and replacing its split personality poster with one that presents a \"warmer, more romantic\" image, playing up love interest Renee Zellweger, and one of the film's more appealing characters, a cow. </p> <p>All this sturm und drang about a movie is a new departure for British mental health organisations. Unlike in the US, where minority groups routinely protest at films and TV programmes they find offensive, campaigners here fret about appearing to have a sense of humour by-pass, or being thought overly PC. Now though, the tide may be turning. </p> <p>The NSF and other charities have begun advising TV scriptwriters - for example, on EastEnders and Peak Practice - on how to present mental illness in a more realistic and empathetic light. EastEnders' portrayal of the gradual development of schizophrenia in the character Joe Wicks has been widely praised for avoiding sensationalism. </p> <p>The government's national service framework on mental health, its new mental health tsar, and the Royal College of Psychiatry's \"Changing Minds\" campaign have all contributed to giving anti-stigma work a higher profile. Generally, there is more awareness across the care professions of the way that stigma and discrimination deepen the distress caused by mental illness, fuel nimbyism and make early, successful treatment less likely. </p> <p>Nevertheless, 70% of people still see schizophrenics as a threat to themselves and their families: one of the most feared groups after paedophiles and drug-pushers. This, despite the fact that one in 100 people will develop the illness at some time, and that - contrary to popular mythology - the proportion of homicides carried out by mentally ill people has been falling since the late 1950s. Although it is a serious mental disorder that may involve delusions and hallucinations, schizophrenia has nothing to do with harbouring multiple personalities. And the risk of violent behaviour among people with the illness is only marginally greater than for the population as a whole. </p> <p>Psychiatrist Peter Byrne, who heads up the RCP's working party on media and stigma, argues that ignorance and crude stereotyping contributes enormously to the distress experienced by mentally ill people and their relatives. \"Take the powerful psycho-killer image that's used so often in movies. Research has shown that for someone with severe mental illness, this is often the single biggest contributor to the stigma they suffer.\" Even a semi-realistic medical drama like ER invariably shows mentally ill people as violent and dangerous, he says, most infamously in the dramatic episodes that involved a double stabbing by a man with schizophrenia. </p> <p>Byrne finds Me, Myself and Irene deliberately and cynically offensive. He wants it to go out with a health warning, stating that the behaviour displayed by its central character has nothing to do with schizophrenia, or indeed any actual mental disorder. Emma Harding, a young woman diagnosed as schizophrenic, agrees. </p> <p>\"The most sickening thing about the film is that it makes it seem OK to laugh at people with mental health problems, and that we're all totally out of control, as well as violent and dangerous. I have enough problems trying to convince my friends I'm not a \"psycho\" without needing this. </p> <p>\"But how far should this argument be taken? Me, Myself and Irene is not a health education film: it's an absurdist scattergun comedy. Images of madness - comic, tragic or both -have been a source of enduring fascination in films as far back as the escape-from-the-asylum chases of the silent movies, through to classics like Three Faces of Eve, Psycho and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. There is a whole genre of films based on multiple personality disorders alone. The attraction is obvious. Losing their mental health is most people's biggest dread. Films about madness, particularly ones that exaggerate the distinction between \"us\" and \"them\", tap into this fear but also allow us to take comfort in our normality. Hollywood knows this, which is why it has a whole new round of psycho-social dramas and remakes on the blocks. </p> <p>\"What all this is about is our inability to deal with difference,\" says Bruce Irvine, a clinical psychologist who works with adolescents. \"You can protest at harmful, distorted images of mental illness, but you can't stop people laughing at them. If anything, demonising this film may only make it more successful.\" </p> <p>For Carrey's critics, it's a risk worth taking. Paul Corry of the NSF says they are not against humour about mental illness, or showing schizophrenia for the frightening, psychotic condition it is. Productions like Blue/Orange at the National Theatre, or the feature film Some Voices, due out next week, prove it's possible to do both to great effect, he argues. And there are many other examples that successfully tread the fine line between dramatic effect and parody. What is unacceptable in the 21st century is to characterise someone who is mentally ill as a village idiot figure of fun. </p> <p>\"Looking for cheap laughs in this way would be ruled out for almost any other minority group,\" he says. </p> <p><strong>The old Jekyll and Hyde formula</strong></p> <p> Berating the Farrely Brothers' new movie for giving a misleading portrayal of mental illness is rather like accusing a Bruce Willis movie of failing to capture the realities of international terrorism. Me, Myself and Irene is the latest comedy from Hollywood's leading exponents of immature humour, and it is their weakest film yet, with forced attempts at grossness and characters that are as flat as a pancake. </p> <p>But fears that it will give children the wrong idea about schizophrenics is a form of hollow political correctness that is misjudged and misplaced. Jim Carrey plays a policeman who never deals with his problems, resulting in the birth of a monstrous alter ego to his unflaggingly nice guy: a husky-voiced monster who does exactly as he pleases. </p> <p>It is the old split-personality cinematic vehicle that can be traced back to Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and is so far removed from reality that there is little in it that merits offence, only mild irritation. The word \"schizo\" crops up a few times and sounds like an out-of-date childhood taunt, but beyond that, this is pure popcorn-munching fodder about an unbelievable character going through a slapstick routine. </p> <p>Carrey's character has about as much connection with any recognisable form of mental illness as The Incredible Hulk. </p> <p>With far more important issues to be alarmed about concerning the treatment of the mentally ill in general, voicing outrage at a silly, bad taste movie seems to be in, well, bad taste.</p> <p>\u0095 For details about the Me, Myself and Irene campaign contact NSF, 30 Tabernacle Street, London EC2A 4DD, tel: 020-7330 9110, website <a href=\"http://www.nsf.org.uk\">www.nsf.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Certain truths about Scotland are held to be absolute. King among them is that Scottish education is excellent. The nation that first saw the vision of a teacher in every community in 1561 still leads the world in matters pedagogical. Or so the myth runs - and heaven help any curmudgeon who dares challenge it. So the crisis that has enveloped Scottish education since the revelation that this year's Higher results are unreliable has dealt a blow to national pride. The SNP's education spokeswoman, Nicola Sturgeon, calls it \"the biggest disaster ever to hit Scottish education\". The head of the quango responsible for processing results, the Scottish Qualifications Authority, has resigned. Ms Sturgeon insists that the education minister, Sam Galbraith, should follow. </p> <p>The first minister, Donald Dewar, returned from sick-leave on Monday to find his administration in crisis again. Section 28 was bad, the subsequent revelation that an underspend in the Scottish health budget had been reallocated to less important portfolios was worse. An education crisis trumps the lot. Can it be that the crown jewel of Scottish society, the almost universally lauded system of secondary education, is in the hands of incompetents? Yes, but the incompetents are not Mr Galbraith, Mr Dewar or the SQA. The guilty ones are those teachers and local authority educationalists who are rubbing their hands in glee at the \"disaster\" that has befallen Higher candidates. </p> <p>There has been a torrent of sympathy for the victims - university applicants who cannot be certain that their exam certificates are accurate. Some are the victims of genuine errors. But when the dust has settled they will turn out to be very few. The truth about this crisis is that it is being milked for all it is worth by an alliance of complacent professionals with a desire to disguise the real problem in Scottish education. For Scotland's dominant teaching union, the EIS, the exams fiasco is heaven-sent. Just as Mr Galbraith and the Scottish executive had begun to win their argument that modernisation of schools and reform of the teaching profession is urgently required, modernisation has produced an armour-plated, ocean-going catastrophe. The \"told you sos\" can be heard at every dinner party in Morningside and Bearsden. </p> <p>Teachers have the chance to hit back at those who dared to say they were failing. They warned that introduction of a modernised Higher syllabus could not be achieved smoothly or efficiently. Now they have their proof. Mr Galbraith can be vilified for imposing change and risking confrontation over teachers' pay and conditions. </p> <p>But Mr Galbraith is right. He knows schools in Scotland are not superb. He knows they are not even good. In private he has been heard to admit that in some respects, Scottish schools are not as good as those in England and Wales. Do not underestimate the significance of this. A Scot who unfavourably compares Scottish schools with those south of the border is the Caledonian equivalent of a Palestinian convert to Zionism. </p> <p>Damn the facts - that at age 14 proficiency in maths among Scottish pupils is substantially below the OECD average; that it falls short even of the mediocre attainments of pupils in England and Wales; Overlook the similarly depressing pattern in the teaching of science. The country that spawned John Logie Baird, James Watt and Alexander Graham Bell came 26th out of 41 in a recent international study of science teaching. Discount the appalling shortcomings in the teaching of modern languages, falling standards of literacy and the plethora of sober criticism contained in the Scottish executive's own publication, Standards and Quality in Scottish Schools 1995-1998. </p> <p>Teaching in Scotland is now a profession dominated by the ageing and the disillusioned. Mr Galbraith has made it clear that he intends to change it. He does not understand why teachers ignore their duty to keep thoroughly up to date with developments in their fields. But he is determined to win his battle with Scotland's most carefully protected elite and many teachers detest him for it. They regard the errors made by the SQA as an opportunity to reverse an offensive that was beginning to make progress. </p> <p>Committed, hard-working professionals in Scotland's staff rooms - and of course there are many - had started to see change as an opportunity to perform better and earn more. Their time-serving colleagues were on the back foot, but now they can seize their moment. The old-guard is fighting back. That is why Mr Galbraith is right to press on. He is pursuing a broader objective - to acknowledge that all is not well in Scottish schools and that it is high time something radical was done to improve standards. </p> <p>\u0095 Tim Luckhurst is a former editor of the Scotsman. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:tim@luckhurst.gispnet.com\">tim@luckhurst.gispnet.com</a></p>",
  "Five days after Kirsty Jones was murdered in a guesthouse in northern Thailand, the circumstances surrounding the British backpacker\u0090s death grow stranger. First of all, there are the suspects. Police in Chiang Mai have interviewed eight men - six foreigners and two Thai - who they think may have carried out her killing. <p>All were residents at the Aree guesthouse on the night of the murder in the early hours of last Thursday. None of them could be considered especially, well, conventional.</p> <p>There is for example, Stuart Crichton, a 28-year-old Australian who is keen on street fighting and who is currently in police custody after heroin and cannabis were found in his room. </p> <p>Then there is Glen, an ex-Mormon and self-professed former CIA spy, who has come to Thailand to recover from head injuries suffered in a car accident. The guesthouse's British owner, Andy Gill, 32, meanwhile, is also in prison after police discovered he had overstayed his visa by two years. </p> <p>There is also Nathan Foley, 27, who had dinner with Kirsty on the night of her murder, and who was initially interviewed by police for 13 hours. He was on his way from Australia to visit England and relatives in Kent for the first time.</p> <p>Other suspects include Surin Chanpranet, the guesthouse's diminutive Thai manager who runs a Thai massage school in the upstairs half of the compound, reached by a rickety staircase. Finally there was Stephen Trigg, 27, a bearded British backpacker who has been on the road for four years. It was he who heard Kirsty scream \"Leave me alone, leave me alone, get off me, get off me\" on the night of the murder. He has since been stuck off the suspect list.</p> <p>Mr Trigg and Surin went downstairs to investigate, but decided not to open Kirsty's door after concluding - wrongly - she had merely been involved in a lover's tiff</p> <p>The imbroglio yesterday became murkier still when it emerged that a Thai maid who initially told police she had found Kirsty's body at 4pm last Thursday admitted to detectives she had been lying. She had been \"leant upon\" to give a false statement, she said. Police now believe the manager Mr Chanpranet made the discovery five hours earlier. Either way, it is clear that some of the residents at the guesthouse secretly knew of Kirsty's death several hours before police were informed.</p> <p>What is not clear is why there was a delay in reporting her murder. The delay could merely have been the result of panic among staff at the guesthouse, who realised the gravity of the situation, and the trouble they were in. Or it could have been part of a wider, and darker, conspiracy to try and cover up Kirsty's death and remove traces of evidence. </p> <p>By the time police arrived on the scene, several people had already been inside her room, including an entire Thai television camera crew. Police colonel Prasit Thamdi, who is leading the murder inquiry, yesterday said he was sure one of the eight suspects killed her. \"She knew her killer,\" he added. Each of the suspects denies involvement in the murder. </p> <p>On a cultural level, this tragic case illustrates just how many foreigners who travel to Thailand fall in love with the country and find it difficult to leave. Mr Gill, the guesthouse owner, says he has been coming \"on and off\" to Thailand for 12 years. Stephen, Stuart and Glen are all long-term residents who had been staying at the Aree for several months. </p> <p>Many backpackers stay longer. Life in Chiang Mai is easy, cheap, undemanding, seductive. The narrow lanes in downtown Chiang Mai, which boast Internet cafes, food stalls, bars and second-hand bookshops, are virtually deserted until 11am. Everyone is still in bed, sleeping off the night before.</p> <p>There are other reasons too. Drugs are plentiful here. \"You can get almost anything you want,\" one French backpacker, who did not want to be named, said yesterday. \"You can get heroin, cannabis - anything.\" Following Thailand's economic collapse three years ago, money earned in jobs back at home stretches a long way. </p> <p>The Aree, one of the grottier guesthouses in town, charges 60 baht (\u00a31) a night for a single room. For \u00a32 you can get somewhere quite decent. A Thai meal with beer, and a view of the river, costs around \u00a33 a head. And it is not just the young who come: every day more coaches arrive carrying parties of elderly Italian or Australian tourists wearing shorts.</p> <p>As for Kirsty Jones's killer, it seems only a matter of time before he is arrested, convicted and jailed. Forensic tests on hair left at the scene are expected over the next few days to reveal the killer's blood group. And there is nowhere to run to: two plain-clothes detectives have been assigned to keep watch on every suspect.</p> <p>Immigration authorities have also been alerted to stop anyone from leaving. \"We are confident we will make an arrest in seven to ten days,\" Mr Thamdi said. For the sake of Kirsty Jones, let us hope so.</p>",
  "Labour's summer offensive has halted the modest advances by William Hague's Conservatives and restored a 10 point lead for Tony Blair, according to the August Guardian/ICM opinion poll. <p>The government, basking in the warm afterglow of Gordon Brown's marriage and his equally popular comprehensive spending review, is back up two points to 44%, while the Conservatives have dropped one point to 33%. The gap between the two parties narrowed in July to seven points as Mr Hague's law and order initiatives appeared to hit home. The Guardian/ICM is the third poll in a fortnight to indicate a summer Labour recovery, and so confirm the trend. </p> <p>It also shows the first signs of life stirring among those voters prepared to back Britain's entry to the euro. Some 31% of voters say they would be prepared to back Britain joining the euro if there were a referendum tomorrow. This is an increase of eight points in two months and the highest level of support enjoyed by the pro-euro camp since May 1999. </p> <p>The rise may reflect the impact of warnings from Japanese car manufacturers on the impact of Britain staying out of the euro, or it may be a perverse result of those leaked memos from Tony Blair in which he declared his personal backing for eventual membership of the euro. </p> <p>Whatever the explanation, the pro-euro camp does not appear to have changed many minds. The anti-euro share of the vote has remained solidly at the 57%-58% mark, and the increase in support for the euro has nearly all come from moves from the \"don't knows\" to the yes camp. Mr Blair has a long way to close the gap between yes and no camps before he calls the promised referendum after the election. </p> <p>The longer term perspective provided by the graphic, showing the average ICM poll positions for each year since 1992, gives a measure of how much progress Mr Hague has yet to make before he starts to threaten Labour's commanding Commons majority. </p> <p>The run of leaked memorandums revealing the anxieties of some of Labour's high command about the scale of their expected second term general election victory next year, and the arguments over asylum and law and order, have added a couple of points to the Conservatives' poll rating - so that they are hitting 34%-35% each month, rather than 31%-32%. </p> <p>But the longer term perspective shows the reality is that the Conservative share has languished in the low 30s, and has yet to recover the ground lost by the cataclysmic Black Wednesday in 1992 when the pound suffered its humiliating exit from the European exchange rate mechanism and interest rates hit 15%. </p> <p>Labour, with its average rating for 2000 at 44% - the share it actually polled in its historic 1997 victory - would appear to be on course for a second term with a very large Commons majority. The fall from a peak of 53% represents nothing more than the bursting of the bubble of euphoria that built up after Labour's first victory in 23 years. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrats have remained becalmed at around the 17%-18% share of the vote for three years now. But the party's strategists are unlikely to be dismayed, as they will no doubt again employ a key seats strategy in an attempt to hold on to their 46 MPs. </p> <p>ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,050 adults aged 18 and over by telephone between August 11 and 13.

  "Detectives in Thailand investigating the murder of British backpacker Kirsty Jones are to carry out fresh blood tests on the eight suspects, after the initial results proved inconclusive. <p>The head of Maharaj university hospital's forensic department, Paiton Narongchai, said it would probably be Friday before the results of the new tests - on the six foreign and two Thai suspects - were known. </p> <p>He added police had shifted their suspicions since last week from the six foreigners to the two Thais. </p> <p>Ms Jones, 23, from Tredomen, in Powys, was found murdered at the Aree guest house in Chiang Mai six days ago. Her body was yesterday collected from the hospital by a British embassy official and will be flown back to Britain later today. </p> <p>Nong Nee, a maid at the guest house, has told police Ms Jones's body was found by Andy Gill, the Aree's British owner, four and a half hours before her death was reported to police. </p> <p>The maid said Surin Chanpranet, the Aree's Thai manager, had become suspicious on hearing screams during the night. At noon the following day he decided to investigate. </p> <p>\"Surin told me: 'Last night I heard something wrong in the room. Maybe if I open the door I find something. I want to look inside',\" Ms Nee said. </p> <p>\"I got the key for him. Surin then fetched Andy. Andy went to look in the room. He then came out. He called Surin from upstairs. They both went to look at the body. Surin drew his hand across his neck. I knew that Kirsty was dead.\" </p> <p>Ms Nee, 17, said Mr Chanpranet ushered her into his room. \"He told me: 'If I call the police there is a big problem. I need time to think'.\" </p> <p>Mr Gill, 32, went to find a friend, she said, who was not in. Ms Nee claimed: \"Andy came back and said: 'I need to get away because my visa is finished.' Ten minutes later he left.\" </p> <p>With the body still lying in a downstairs bedroom, Mr Chanpranet then opened a beer, Ms Nee said. He did nothing for several hours, she added. In her initial statement, Ms Nee claimed she had discovered the body at 4.30pm when she went to clean the room. But she made a new statement to detectives on Monday after, she said, realising the gravity of the situation. </p> <p>Several police officers went yesterday to the guest house and took Mr Chanpranet into custody to be interviewed. Police said they wanted to talk to him again because his story was inconsistent with that of the maid. He denied involvement in the killing. </p> <p>Ms Nee has also told police she believed the killer may have had an accomplice. \"They told me they think so too,\" she said. </p> <p>The suspects include Mr Gill and Nathan Foley, 27, a backpacker with dual Australian and British nationality who had dinner with Kirsty on the night of her murder. An Australian, Stuart Crichton, 28, has also been tested.</p>",
  "The Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton wrote the lines, \" Things done for gain are naught, but great things done endure\", sealed them in a copper tube and placed it on the ice in homage to three dead friends, writes John Ezard . <p>Some 83 years later the epitaph has been rediscovered. His words, with the tube, go on show at the National Maritime Museum in London from September 14 as a testament to the heroism of the Antarctic quest early in the 20th century. </p> <p>Shackleton's tribute to the \"forgotten men\" who died in his attempt to cross Antarctica was itself forgotten first in the Admiralty, then in the museum's storerooms, for more than half a century. </p> <p>The mementoes will be displayed in the exhibition South: the Race to the Pole. David Spence, exhibitions director, said they added a new dimension to the saga of the Imperial Transatlantic Expedition, which began under Shackleton's leadership in 1915. </p> <p>The three men who died were Captain Aeneas Mackintosh, the Rev Arnold Spencer-Smith and Victor Hayward. Their role was to trek across Antarctica leaving food depots for Shackleton's oncoming party. But his vessel Endurance got frozen in, forcing him to change course and head by boat for South Georgia. </p> <p>The Mackintosh team continued their mission \"for the good of Shackleton\". They accomplished it, but one died from scurvy and two others died while trying to cross ice in a blizzard in the Ross Sea. Shackleton was unable to travel to rescue survivors of the party until 1917. </p> <p>In 1947 a US expedition found the tube and sent it to the British admiralty. In 1949 a new copper tube with a copy of the poem was placed on the site.</p>",
  "Draconian new legislation designed to curtail the activities of foreign opposition groups based in Britain slipped quietly on to the statute book last month, the few whimpers of protest silenced by the public panic over paedophiles. Barely six months since these columns were warning of its implications, the Terrorism Act has been bludgeoned through without any alterations worth mentioning. <p>The government would have us believe it is a timely replacement for the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989, which dealt primarily with Northern Ireland, bringing the law up to date with the changing nature of terrorism. Critics counter that its indiscriminate scope is designed to harass and intimidate into silence all opposition deemed a hindrance by Whitehall. They are right. The main feature of this legislation is its deliberate bluntness. It is intended not to strike dread into the hearts of those who cannot distinguish between bullet and ballot box, but to cow all legitimate opposition to foreign regimes with whom our foreign secretary wishes to carry on his \"ethical\" business. </p> <p>At a stroke the act has reshaped the landscape in which opposition groups can work. It is now illegal to call for the violent overthrow of unelected, despotic governments in countries such as Algeria; to campaign for the liberation of occupied lands such as Kashmir and Palestine; or to engage in weapons training for the purposes of freedom and self-determination. </p> <p>The act affects Muslim groups more than most. After the demise of communism, the role of challenging the political and cultural hegemony of the west was thrust upon a reluctant and out-of-shape Islam. Muslim governments were in no position to rise to the challenge. Since independence, most Muslim countries, especially in the Middle East, have acted as client states for the west, enjoying a symbiotic relationship by which their monarchs and oligarchs have been kept in power in return for access to cheap oil. As usual, it is the man and woman on the street who have paid the price. Many have gravitated towards opposition groups which, with no democratic avenues for dissent, have ended up moving abroad. </p> <p>London has been a popular choice. Leaders of groups ranging from the militant Egyptian Gama'a Islamiya to Tunisia's pacifist an-Nahda movement have all enjoyed the freedoms that have earned the city a deserved reputation as an international safe haven. The Terrorism Act signals they have overstayed their welcome. </p> <p> Middle Eastern regimes, along with Israel and the US (to whose regional hegemony such groups now provide the only resistance), have urged Britain to adopt a more draconian view of terrorism, one that further blurs the distinction between freedom fighter and terrorist. Whereas the PTA concerned itself with threats to the United Kingdom, the tentacles of the new act extend worldwide. It is now an offence to campaign for - this includes raising funds for or otherwise promoting - the assassination of an Assad or Mubarak, on the grounds that it represents a call to murder. </p> <p>In fact, the act is so broad it may well prove unworkable. It defines terrorism as the use or threat of force \"designed to influence the government or to intimidate the public or a section of the public, and advance a political, religious, or ideological cause\". That includes the students who raise money outside the mosque for the mujahideen in Chechnya. It includes the imams who pray for their success in their sermons. And it includes those who rally in Trafalgar Square to espouse jihad as a weapon of political liberation. Another damaging consequence of the act is the power it gives the police to stop and question and arraign suspects. Under the act it is enough for an officer merely to entertain a suspicion that somebody is breaching the law in order to justify a stop and search or an arrest. </p> <p>The new act cements a definition of national security established in May in the case of Shafiq ur Rehman, a Pakistani imam who was ordered to be deported for his (unproven) links to the Kashmiri liberation group the Lashkar-i-Toiba. Mr Rehman was given his marching orders under the Immigration Act 1971 after the judge decided that his activities endangered Britain's relations with India. Whether Mr Rehman had actually threatened relations was not the point, the judge ruled. The material consideration was that he was capable of doing so. \"The promotion of terrorism is capable of being a threat to our own national security,\" he said. Great. You are now a threat to national security if you merely hold certain views or associations even if you don't follow them through. Such a view of national security is far too broad. It holds out the prospect of arrest for, say, the comedian Mark Thomas for opposing controversial schemes like the Turkish dam project, or for Greenpeace activists disrupting French nuclear tests. </p> <p>Mr Rehman is appealing the decision. If he fails he stands to be deported, but it could have been worse. Had the Terrorism Act been in place when he was charged, he might have been facing the next decade behind bars. </p> <p>\u0095 Faisal Bodi is a British Muslim journalist. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:fbodi@totalise.co.uk\">fbodi@totalise.co.uk</a></p>",
  "In 1943, the young Italian anarchist, Goliardo Fiaschi, falsified his birth certificate - to make himself seem older than his 13 years - and joined the wartime Italian partisans. Armed with a captured rifle almost as big as himself, he accompanied the women who regularly crossed the Apennines on foot to carry food from Parma, Reggio or Modena, some 150 miles away, back to the starving inhabitants of his Tuscan birthplace, Massa di Carrara. In 1944, he was adopted as a mascot by the Costrignano Brigade, and, in that role, entered Modena as standard-bearer on its liberation in April 1945. <p>Fiaschi, who has died aged 69, was one of the youngest of the generation of anti- fascist partisans who fought against Mussolini's rule in Italy and Franco in Spain. </p> <p>The natives of Carrara are reputedly descendants of Phoenician slaves who quarried marble for Rome. The city is also the cradle of Italian anarchism and a historical centre of rebellion. The fascist years in Italy, from 1922 onwards, were particularly bitter in Carrara. The city itself was twice liberated from the Nazis by anarchist partisans prior to the arrival of allied troops </p> <p>After the liberation, Fiaschi returned to the quarries, where he had worked from the age of eight, alongside his father and uncle. By the early 1950s, he was involved with the Spanish refugee committee and became friendly with Jose Lluis Facerias, a veteran Spanish anarchist of the Ascaso column in the Spanish civil war, who had been freed from a Francoist jail in 1945 and had lived illegally in Carrara since 1952. </p> <p>In August 1957, the two men crossed the Pyrenees on bicycles to join the guerrilla struggle against Francoism. They were detected within a fort night; Fiaschi was arrested in a forest hideout and Facerias murdered in a guardia civile ambush in the Barcelona suburbs. After beatings and torture, Fiaschi was brought before a military court in August 1958, where he was sentenced to 20 years and one day in jail. </p> <p>For more than a decade, in 40 Spanish prisons, Fiaschi sent thousands of postcards, decorated with precisely detailed paintings, to friends and acquaintances. I met him first in one of those jails, and I was to receive those cards throughout the 35 years of our friendship, the last of which arrived only a few weeks be fore his death. With amnesties, he was released in 1966. </p> <p>He returned to Italy to serve a 10-year prison sentence - passed in absentia, without his knowledge, without any notification of the charges and without representation in court. This conviction was for alleged involvement in a 1957 bank robbery in Monferrato with Facerias. Following an international campaign, he was finally released from prison after 17 years in March 1974. </p> <p>Fiaschi became a key figure in the local anarchist movement. He ran a bookshop and cultural circle, and was a prime mover in the occupa tion of the Germinal Centre located, embarrassingly for the city fathers, in the most prestigious building in Carrara's main square. Occupied by anarchist partisans during the liberation in 1945, the building had been the defiant focus of anarchist activity until 1990, when the local authority finally wrested it back. </p> <p>After last year's May Day celebrations in Carrara, which he had always helped organise, Fiaschi announced that he was terminally ill and was preparing to end his life. Persuaded to shelve this plan, instead he went into hospital saying: \"There was a time when suicide would have been the right thing. I could have left my body to science and for the advancement of medicine. Now, I must surrender myself alive, so they can study me. I realise they will carry out all sorts of experiments on me, but, since my death is inevitable anyway, I will try to be equal to the task.\" </p> <p>Brought home after 14 months in a cancer ward, Fiaschi died the following day. His coffin was borne around the town on the shoulders of friends, followed by a band, and anarchists from all over Italy carrying red and black flags. He was laid to rest beside Gino Lucetti and Steffano Vatteroni, both would- be assassins of Mussolini, and Giuseppe Pinelli, who was defenestrated from police headquarters in Milan in 1969. </p> <p>Such was the esteem in which Goliardo Fiaschi was held that even the ranks of Tuscany, in the person of the mayor of Carrara, could scarce forbear to cheer with a farewell notice, which ended with the words: \"Thanks, Goliardo!\" </p> <p>He is survived by his sister. </p> <p>\u0095 Goliardo Fiaschi, anarchist, born August 21 1930; died July 29 2000</p>"
