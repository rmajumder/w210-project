  "<h2>Ithaka by Adele Geras (David Fickling Books, \u00a312.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504225\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2005/10/20/ithaka_final.jpg\" alt=\"Ithaka by Adele Geras\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=0385603916\">Buy Ithaka at the Guardian bookshop</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  This is the story of the women who wait for Odysseus to return from Troy. Of the many versions of Homer's epic, this is the first - with apologies to James Joyce - to do justice to the women in the story. It's a home, rather than a homecoming, narrative. Touching and engaging. <p> <br></p> <h2>The Rainbow Opera by Elizabeth Knox (Faber)</h2> <p>First of two books about a world in which some people are able to control dreams. A political candidate pays a corrupt dreamcatcher to give people dreams promoting his candidacy. Cousins Laura (a dreamcatcher) and Rose (who doesn't have a skill) embark on a journey to discover that not all is well with the way dreams are being used.</p> <h2>The Moth Diaries by Rachel Klein (Faber, \u00a39.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504226\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2004/06/30/mothdiaries.jpg\" alt=\"The Moth Diaries\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  With teenagers flocking to see Mean Girls at the cinema this month, it's a good time to give them this book, a more literary take on the life of a 16-year-old girl cloistered in an American boarding school. The action takes place in the 1960s, but the girls' private dramas unfold in a rarefied world, isolated from the political turmoil of the anti-war demos going on outside. The narrator's best friend, Lucy, becomes enchanted with exotic new girl Ernessa, who has a terrifying secret. The narrator's diaries record her friend's distress, and the tragedies that result. <h2>Time Switch by Matt Chamings (Faber, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>Some time in the 1870s a boy invents a time machine. Then, in our time, another boy appears at the bottom of a family's garden. The story opens with a funeral in 1879, setting the tone for a tale that is scary, but also funny. This is Chamings' first book, written after he was made redundant, and it is a gripping story.</p> <h2>Poison by Chris Wooding (Scholastic, \u00a312.99)</h2> <p>Poison, stroppy adolescent par excellence, takes the blame when her baby sister is kidnapped. But this is an alternative world of phaeries and changelings. Poison sets off on a journey to rescue her sister, but soon comes up against the limits of her own willpower.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>Viaduct Child by Patrick Wood (Scholastic, \u00a312.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504227\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/12/05/viaductchild.jpg\" alt=\"Viaduct Child\" width=\"128\" height=\"189\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  Dushma is a non-person, living by a railway viaduct in a London that is recognisably like our own but also scarily different. Dushma is a non-person because a scan carried out when she was still in the womb showed that there was something odd about her brain. The state doesn't like anyone who might be a burden on resources. If you are not registered, you can't go to school, see a doctor or travel on public transport . . . you don't exist. So when the police raid her flat, Dushma escapes into the disused underground tunnels, where she joins up with a gang of teenagers living on their wits. This supremely confident first novel creates an all too believable future world of iron-gloved state control. And Wood doesn't cop out with any patronising \"happy ever afters\". <br> <h2>Malka by Mirjam Pressler (Picador, \u00a39.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504228\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/12/05/malka.jpg\" alt=\"Malka\" width=\"128\" height=\"202\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  It is September 1943. In the sleepy rural Polish backwater close to the Hungarian border, Jewish doctor Hannah Mai is burying her head in the sand, convinced that the Nazis will do her and her two daughters, teenage Minna and seven-year-old Malka, no harm. Then the round-up of Jews begins. Hannah sets off with her daughters towards the border. Then Malka falls sick and, faced with a kind of Sophie's Choice, Hannah takes the one chance offered to get herself and Minna to safety on the understanding that Malka will join them later. Instead, Malka ends up in a Jewish ghetto. Based on a true story, this is a powerful tale which explores not only the Holocaust, but also the complexities of motherhood and the reflexes that make us battle to survive. <h2>Sabriel by Garth Nix (Collins, \u00a312.99)</h2> <p>Another fantasy novel with a strangely named heroine. But that is the only formulaic thing about Garth Nix's darkly complex novel. Sabriel is the daughter of Abhorsen, an \"Old Kingdom\" necromancer who can cross into the land of the dead. Sabriel has inherited his gift but attends a boarding school on the other side of the wall in the New Kingdom. The dead have a nasty habit of not staying dead in the Old Kingdom. When Sabriel receives a message from her father that he is trapped in death, she crosses the wall to try to save him and finds herself face to face with the forces of darkness. Nix weaves a thrilling adventure story as Sabriel must face her fears and journey into death. The writing displays both wit and charm - a rare gift in the fantasy genre.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>Massive by Julia Bell (Young Picador, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>Novels for teenagers about eating disorders can be tricky. Bell's debut novel is tough, grimy and truthful as it looks at three women in the same family with food problems. For Carmen's mum Maria, thin equals success. She despairs of her podgy teenage daughter and, when a job opportunity arises in Birmingham, she whisks Carmen away to the big city. Soon Carmen is discovering her roots, including a grandmother who equates food with affection. Bell comes at her subject with a clever obliqueness, using the dislocated experience of the strange city to reflect Maria's and Carmen's fixations on food. A small chink of hope at the end suggests that Carmen will break the vicious circle and that the legacy will not be passed on.</p> <h2>Exodus by Julie Bertagna (Picador, \u00a39.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504229\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/11/15/Exodus.jpg\" alt=\"Exodus by Julie Bertagna\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  It is the future. It is more than half a century since the fuel ran out, the oceans rose and drowned the cities, and the ships that supplied the island where Mara was born stopped coming. Now Mara's island is cut off and there is no future for her people. Using the defunct technology that was once the web, Mara discovers there might be a new world out there, with tall cities out of reach of the water. <br>This is a miracle of a novel, one that defies those critics who claim that teenagers don't need novels written specially for them. It has a memorable heroine, is written in stark, simple prose and uses an imaginatively created world to look at our own problems - whether it is global warming or the refugee crisis. This is a book you will remember for the rest of your life. <p> <br></p> <h2>Dovey Coe by Frances O'Roark Dowell (Walker, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>On the cusp of adolescence, Dovey Coe watches the world intently, feels things strongly and always speaks her mind, which can get her into trouble. Particularly when her pretty elder sister, Caroline, starts toying with the affections of Parnell Caraway, the no-good local rich boy who always gets what he wants and would like to add Caroline to his collection. Over my dead body, thinks Dovey, but it is Parnell who ends up dead and Dovey on trial for his murder.<br>Frances O'Roark Dowell's novel is a delicately written account of life as an outsider in a rural American community in the 20s. Dovey is such a wonderful, strong character that she seems to speak directly to the reader, while the writing has the wistful quality of precious, long-distant memories.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>The Haunting Of Alaizabel Cray by Chris Wooding (Scholastic, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>Chris Wooding's novel was passed over for these pages when it was published in hardback last year on the grounds that the cover looked like a record sleeve for a heavy metal band circa 1975 and the fact that it fell into the fantasy horror genre. Big mistake. Inside is one of the most intelligent, atmospheric and spine-tingling novels published for teenagers in recent years.<br>Wooding sets his novel in a London that is most certainly in the future but feels Victorian gothic, where a sinister Masonic society is plotting to take over, a curious Jack the Ripper stalks the streets and in the Old Quarter, overrun with wolves and wych-kin, young Thaniel is doing battle against baby-snatching ghouls, the influential Fraternity and the demons we conjure for ourselves. Breathtakingly brilliant.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>Warehouse by Keith Gray (Red Fox, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504230\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/07/10/warehouse.jpg\" alt=\"Warehouse\" width=\"128\" height=\"197\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  The Warehouse is a place you can go when you've got nowhere else to go and have run out of money, options and even hope. It may be so rundown that even the young people who call it home describe it as \"Crap Palace\", but it is a place of safety in an uncertain and often dangerous world. Particularly for 15-year-old Robbie who is being used as a punchbag by his unhappy, vicious elder brother Frank, and for poor little rich girl Amy who set out to prove to her parents that she could hack it on her own but wound up in trouble within hours of leaving home. <br>Gray's novel is cleverly structured grabbing the reader by the scruff of the neck and pulling him or her into the entwining stories of this community of outcasts. Tough, tender and true. <p> <br></p> <h2>The Journal of Danny Chaucer (Poet) by Roger Stevens (Dolphin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Novels written in poetic form are big news in the US teenage fiction market, and this home-grown effort is up there with the best. Danny Chaucer is an Adrian Mole without the wimpishness or pomposity, and the gap between Danny's fantasy life and reality is wittily chronicled in a story that follows the thyth of the school year, first love and loss, and all the pains of growing up. Particularly the sledgehammer blow when his best friend goes off with Jenny, the girl of his dreams.<br>Stevens' verse is jaunty, knowing and tart and he gets right inside the dark, dark corners of the adolescent male mind. Although the verse form may take a page or two to get used to, it actually makes this an easier and less daunting book for reluctant readers than the traditional prose novel.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>Fake by KK Beck (Scholastic Press, \u00a37.99)</h2> <p>Danny has been having problems with his mum and unsympathetic stepdad. Even so, it comes as a shock when he is forcibly shipped off to the Utah desert to attend a jackboot training camp for kids with \"behavioural issues\". Only, he never gets there. Keith, also being escorted to the camp, has a go at the escorts with a crow bar and goes on the run with Danny. But keith has his own interests in mind.<br>This is a thumpingly good thriller, cleverly plotted and tightly written, with a growing Kafkaesque quality as Danny realises that his identity has been stolen and there is nothing he can do about it. As perceptive on parental agendas as it is on teenagers' needs and mindsets, Beck's novel is a racy read with plenty to ponder.</p> <h2>Number 99 by Patrick Cave (Oxford University Press, \u00a36.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504231\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/04/24/number99.jpg\" alt=\"Number 99\" width=\"128\" height=\"204\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  When the camp where 13-year-old traveller Kez lives is raided by police, she thinks it is just another example of prejudiced attitudes towards people with an alternative lifestyle. But with her mother mysteriously missing and the authorities behaving very strangely, it soon becomes apparent that something more sinister is going on. Placed as the 99th foster child of a kindly woman in Camberwell, Kez hooks up with foster child number one (now a flash success in the civil service), and a local boy who is an outcast of a different kind, to get to the bottom of things. Cave's very readable novel doesn't quite hang together as seamlessly as a good thriller should, but the theme is developed without moralising or sentimentality as the novel perceptively considers different ways of life and the choices we make about how we want to live. <h2>Spindle's End by Robin McKinley (David Fickling, \u00a310.99)</h2> <p>When young Katriona pulls the lot that wins her a chance to go to the big city for the little princess's christening day, it changes her life. Suddenly, she finds herself responsible for a tiny little baby whose life is under threat. There are times when ordinariness is the very best disguise something - or someone - can have, and life in Katriona's village doesn't come more ordinary. Ordinary, that is, for a country where magic is \"so thick and tenacious that it settled over the land like chalk dust\". I would recommend very few of the novels written for teenagers that pass through my hands to a discerning adult reader. So this is a bit of a find. An extraordinarily imaginative retelling of the Sleeping Beauty fairytale, McKinley's book is genuinely enchanting but emotionally tough.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>Break Point by Rosie Rushton (Piccadilly Press, \u00a36.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504232\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/03/27/breakpoint.jpg\" alt=\"Break Point\" width=\"128\" height=\"197\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  Sixteen-year-old Emily is fantastic at tennis and could have a glittering career ahead of her, particularly now that she's won a scholarship to a famous tennis academy. Emily's mum, a single parent, who has scrimped and saved to help Emily on her way, is over the moon. There is just one problem: Emily has had quite enough of tennis. She wants a social life and a chance to stay on at school and do A-levels, go to university and maybe work with an aid agency in Africa. It shows how three successive generations of women - daughter, mother and grandmother- are confined or liberated not just by circumstance and the era into which they were born, but also by the personal choices they make. The teenager who reads this could end up looking at her mother differently. <h2>Changing Emma by John Brindley (Dolphin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>On the day Emma gets her GCSE results, her parents win \u00a323m on the lottery. Only her gran remembers to tell her how well she has done. But who cares about school and GCSEs when you are rich beyond your wildest dreams? Soon, old friends are forgotten as Emma is living it up, attracting the attention of the local dreamboat and feeling like a million dollars. This is an old-fashioned morality tale dressed up in a racy, contemporary format and one that is memorable for the way it gets right under its anti-heroine's skin to portray the pain of knowing that you are behaving really badly but unable to stop. Even if they haven't won \u00a323m, most teenagers have been to some of the dark emotional places Emma visits here.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>Wicca: Book of Shadows by Cate Tiernan (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504233\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/02/14/wicca.jpg\" alt=\"Wicca: Shadows\" width=\"128\" height=\"191\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  Do you have a teenage daughter who loves Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek? Perhaps she is a rather reluctant reader, but don't despair - help is at hand with this new series that crosses high school angst and romance with witchcraft. Sixteen-year-old Morgan is the shy one in a crowd led by her stunning best friend Bree. But when Cal, an attractive new boy, arrives in town and invites them all to join a coven, Morgan finds herself the centre of attention. The discovery that she is a blood witch brings tensions to the surface and romance to a head. Despite the witchcraft, it does deal realistically and sensitively with teenage worries. A new book will be published each month between now and August. <p> <br></p> <h2>Thursday's Child by Sonia Hartnett (Walker, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>It is the worst years of the Great Depression, and Harper Flute and her family are struggling to survive in a shanty shack on a dusty, unforgiving piece of land. On the day the new baby arrives, Harper takes little brother Tin fishing. Buried in a mud slide, Tin miraculously survives but can't stop tunnelling. Soon he is living permanently underneath the shack burrowing away, with consequences that are both tragic and liberating. In its evocation of the adult world seen through the eyes of a child, this book has the feel of an American classic, such as To Kill a Mockingbird - although its author is Australian. Certainly, few British novelists for young people deliver with such density or so uncompromisingly. Hartnett writes without self-censorship or artificial boundaries between adult and children ' s literature. The result is a deep, and deeply moving, novel.</p>",
  "<p>Enterprise Oil, Britain's biggest independent oil and gas explorer, yesterday put BP and Shell in the shade by reporting a sevenfold increase in profits. </p> <p>The company booked an interim profit after tax and excluding exceptional items of \u00a3239m compared with \u00a336m for the same period, a performance which chief executive Pierre Jungels described as \"stunning.\"</p> <p>Shares in the company soared to a fresh year high, hitting 610p before finishing the day up 19.5p at 594.5p as the City pencilled in full year profits of around \u00a3440m.</p> <p>Mr Jungels said the huge upturn in crude prices had boosted the figures but said the company had played a big part by increasing production by 40%.</p> <p>Enterprise, criticised like others in the sector for offering investors poor returns over longer commodity cycles, would not be loosening its tight financial controls just be cause oil had hit a ten year high.</p> <p>\"We will continue to maintain our capital discipline and seek to generate shareholder value throughout the cycle,\" he said, pointing out that capital expenditure would only be increased 10% this year.</p> <p>Enterprise produced a return on capital employed of around 23% on an annualised basis which was better than both BP and Shell, which also produced strong results, industry experts said.</p> <p>But they pointed out that the UK explorer had none of the downstream refining operations owned by the majors which suffer from high crude prices but protect group margins when oil prices are low.</p> <p>Iain Reid, analyst with UBS Warburg said the Enterprise performance overall was solid but he warned oil prices were likely to dip next year, bringing company profits down with them. \"This is probably the high-water mark for the entire exploration and production sector,\" he said.</p> <p>Enterprise said it had made important discoveries in most of its key areas such as Norway and successfully appraised its US Gulf of Mexico Llano find and its Irish Corrib field. There would be an important step forward towards developing the UK Clair field while Brazil offered big opportunities.</p> <p>The only blot on the copybook yesterday was an admission it had been forced to write down \u00a343m after pulling out of the Garden Bank 161 field development in the US Gulf where two wells refused to produce expected quantities of crude.</p> <p>Enterprise had also encoutered difficulties on the UK North Sea Banff field where a floating production platform had been forced into drydock because it was not stable enough in rough seas. But it had squeezed much more oil out of the Norwegian Jotun field and Pierce development in the UK North Sea. The better output can average $28.04 per barrel compared with $13.54 in the first half of 1999. A 3p interim dividend, up from 2.8p last time, is planned.</p>",
  "<p><strong>My name is Gary Crocker. I've played Test cricket and one-day internationals for Zimbabwe. I've been told that I was only the second player to achieve the double of a fifty and four wickets on ODI debut. Is this correct? My reason for asking is that I am trying to emigrate to the USA, and this could help my application</strong></p> <p>Yes, you were indeed the second person to do it - and despite the proliferation of one-day internationals recently only one more person has matched your feat. For the benefit of other readers, Gary Crocker was a left-hand batsman and left-arm bowler who played three Tests for Zimbabwe (including their inaugural one in 1992-93, when he drove through the night to play against India after one of the original team was injured) and seven ODIs. His excellent ODI debut performance was 50 and 4 for 26 against India at Harare in Oct 1992. This was a double achieved previously only by another Zimbabwe player, Duncan Fletcher - now England's successful coach - with 69 not out and 4 for 42 in the 1983 World Cup as Zimbabwe pulled off a major surprise by beating Australia in their first officlal one-dayer. The only person to have done it on debut since is Shaun Pollock, with 66 and 4 for 34 for South Africa v England at Cape Town in 1995-96. It's not often we get a question from a genuine Test player - thanks, and good luck with the green card! </p> <p><strong>Who won the national village final at Lord's this year?</strong> asks Matt Norman </p> <p>This year's winners were Elvaston, from Derbyshire, who also won the competition in 1994. This time they beat Eversholt, from Bedfordshire, by 16 runs in the final. </p> <p><strong>You wrote recently about George Headley's 223 in a Test that was abandoned so the English team could catch the boat home. Is this highest individual score in the fourth innings of a Test?</strong> asks Gautam Borooah from Berkeley, California </p> <p>Yes, Headley's 223 for West Indies v England at Kingston in 1929-30 is the highest. There have been three other fourth-innings double-centuries: 221 by Sunil Gavaskar for India v England, The Oval, 1979; 219 by Bill Edrich for England v South Africa in the other Timeless Test, at Durban in 1938-39; and 214 not out by Gordon Greenidge for West Indies v England at Lord's in 1984. Greenidge's was the only one of the four that led to a positive result. </p> <p><strong>I would like to surprise my husband by purchasing some tickets for next year's Tests - what's the best way to go about it?</strong> asks cricket widow Kim Looker </p> <p>There are two Tests against Pakistan next year followed by five against Australia. In between the two series there is a three-way one-day tournament. Tickets aren't available yet, but they should go on sale early in the new year. The <a href=\"http://www.ecb.co.uk\">ECB website</a> has a \"ticket availability\" page which shows you how to order. </p> <p><strong>My coach is a man called Gary Steer, who played for Warwickshire and Derbyshire. Please could you tell me more about his career?</strong> asks Mark Perich </p> <p>Ian Gary Samuel Steer was born in Aston, Birmingham on August 17, 1970. He's a right-hand batsman and right-arm medium-pace bowler. He joined Warwickshire's staff in 1990, and moved to Derbyshire in 1992. He also played for Combined Universities. In all he played in seven first-class matches, and scored 299 runs at an average of 42.71, and took three wickets at 15.33. </p> <p><strong>To settle an argument, can you tell me the Leicestershire side which won the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup in 1975, in batting order?</strong> asks Andy Wilford </p> <p>The team in that Lord's final was Barry Dudleston, John Steele, Chris Balderstone, Brian Davison, Roger Tolchard, Graham Cross, Ray Illingworth (captain), Norman McVicker, Peter Booth, Graham McKenzie and Ken Higgs. Leicestershire bowled Middlesex out for 146 (Mike Smith 83, Gold Award winner McVicker 4 for 20), then scored 150 for 5 (Steele 49, Tolchard 47 not out) to win by five wickets. </p> <p><strong>When did England start to use the six-ball over instead of the eight-ball one?</strong> asks David Curtis </p> <p>The only year that the eight-ball over was used in English cricket was 1939 (it was meant to be a two-year experiment, but the 1940 season didn't happen because of the Second World War). Apart from that the six-ball over has been used here every season since 1899, the last year that five-ball overs were used. </p> <p><strong>Please could tell me who were the first twins to play together in the same Test match?</strong> asks Jean Baldwin </p> <p>A nice easy one to finish with: Australia's Waugh twins (Steve and Mark) are the ONLY twins to play together in Tests. So far they've done it 85 times, which is a record for any pair of brothers. Mark's first cap, against England in 1990-91 (he scored a hundred at Adelaide), came at Steve's expense.</p> <p>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

Very much like that scene, I happened to walk in, I was dressed as a Viking and that scene took place. </p> <p>Q1: Did they let him out of the house?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> No, that's what happened, no he refused to go out. He was extremely stubborn; the same thing with Frank Sinatra not getting out of the car is also my cousin Eddie as well. It is true. I mean we're ready to go a movie and I say, \"Ed, the movies going to be on\" and he says, \"Not until Sinatra finishes his song, it's not polite\". But that is him. </p> <p><strong>Q2</strong>: What was the studio's reaction to Toys, and did they interfere?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> No, they didn't interfere with that film because it was so out there, there was really nothing, y'know.</p> <p>Q2: Did they understand it?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> No, but to be honest with you, most critics didn't understand it either. I probably got criticised for that film more than for any other film I've done in my life. To the point I'm going, \"What did I do?\" It was a surrealistic kind of comedy and it was peculiar and people were living in a pop-out house and it dealt with certain kind of issues and it was an odd-ball kind of film in a way, but a better example would be Rain Man. So Rain Man, for instance, they would say, \"Listen\" and here's the way they would deal with it, \"cause they didn't like the ending but they didn't say it that way and they say, \"Listen, so if you ever feel like you wanna re-shoot some things at the end, y'know, feel free to do that\". I just tell you one quick story, we did have a screening for an audience, where they fill out the cards and they say, \"What do you think of the ending?\" I'll always remember one card that said, \"What do you think of the ending?\" and the person wrote in: \"I was hoping the little guy would snap out of it.'</p> <p><strong>Q3:</strong> The ending of The Natural had a certain tacked on feeling. Was that intentional?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Yes it was, because it was a fable, because of the way the movie progressed it seemed like a logical conclusion. It's an interesting thing because y'know, Bernard Malamud who wrote it had a different ending. It was a much darker ending. We talked about the difference between the book and the film. The film goes a different way than [novelist] Malamud went. On the other hand, I don't think we could have gotten away with Malamud's ending which was he strikes out and he's accused of throwing the game and it ends with \"Say it ain't so Joe, say it ain't so\". It's sort of something where we wouldn't get away with either. And probably it becomes one of the screenwriter going his direction which was into this kind of, I guess, sort of, full fantasy type of work that seemed consistent to that, in my mind. At one time we almost thought that we would just have him swing and it would go, \"Strike three\" and the to black, and that would be the ending. Just to see what the reaction of the studio would have been, which would probably have been to pass out. That Robert Redford strikes out at the end and it just goes to black. . . it seemed consistent to what we were doing.</p> <p><strong>Q4:</strong> Why did you part company after something like 12 years of working with Mark Johnson as your producer?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well, I think because Mark wanted to do a number of films at that point and I was doing certain things. There comes a point because we started out together, that we have different kinds of ambitions. He wanted to pursue other pieces and so at that point in time it seemed the right thing to do. He's gone on to do other things and I've obviously done other things. Although we've just worked this past year on a piece called An Everlasting Piece, which I shot in Ireland. It was a very small movie and it takes place in Belfast in the 80s. It was written by someone who grew up in Belfast and it's a comedy that deals with a couple of wig salesmen. They sell hairpieces. One's Catholic and one's Protestant and they kind of deal with one another set against the backdrop of the 80s in Belfast. So we worked on that one together, y'know, so we still obviously stay in contact.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Do you enjoy being a producer yourself? Because obviously that's something that you've become, I mean apart from your own movies with Baltimore Pictures and now Baltimore Spring Creek Pictures, you've got a kind of roster of productions which aren't necessarily yours.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well there's two different things to it. I mean, one, there are some films that are personal to me that I want to do; there are other ideas that come along and I say, \"I'd like to see that\" and if I can help to facilitate that in some fashion then I would love to do that. So y'know, Analyse This, this past year was out of our company and Perfect Storm was out of our company and Quiz Show was out of our company and some things I'm probably forgetting. Some things are just nice, you say, \"I'd like to see that happen\" and then there are those that I feel more emotionally connected to.</p> <p><strong>Q5:</strong> I want to ask about An Everlasting Piece - why did you get involved with something that seems to be out of the normal course of your film-making, your milieu?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well Mark Johnson gave me the script and I thought it was interesting and he said, \"What about directing?\" I said, \"I don't know, I'm not sure that maybe it shouldn't be an Irish director who does it\" But I said, \"I'll tell you what I'll do, why don't we get some Irish actors together and have a reading of the script and I'll see if what I think is humorous and where I think things work, work. Then if I feel comfortable enough, then I'll do that.\" And we had a reading of it and I thought all the things that were humorous and where the drama was actually, I was very comfortable with and so I agreed to do it. When I went to Belfast, I was sort of surprised because it reminds me of Baltimore! It has the row houses, it's very similar in parts to Baltimore. I was sort of shocked by it, I thought I was doing sort of the Belfast version of Tin Man. It has aspects of that, of course there is the political climate, which we don't really focus on, we really deal with the relationship of these two guys trying to sell hairpieces. It's always the odd man out because if they're in a Catholic neighbourhood then the Protestant is out, or vice versa. And it was an interesting piece because you can deal with those issues without dealing with them head-on and dealing with the comedy which is not the comedy about the troubles, it is really about the relationship between these two guys in what I might consider a much more of a human comedy, and so that's how it happened.</p> <p><strong>Q6:</strong> Do you use self-destructive characters in your personal movies, to ensure the films - because they are based in your memory - don't become too sentimental and soppy?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well I don't think I consciously do any one thing, I think it just becomes, when you lay it out in your head, you go down the road that seems to make sense to you, rather than saying I think I need to do this because it will counter-balance this, etc etc. I think any time you deal with certain things that take place in the past you always struggle with, especially if you're not really action-oriented and you're character-oriented, you're always going to have to deal with the aspects of what is going to be a clich\u00e9 from what we know versus what happened. But I don't try to consciously do any one thing to counter-balance what I think, y'know, someone may think or feel. I have to kind of just rely on my own instincts.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> I just wanted to ask you one supplementary question which is about the burlesque aspect of Liberty Heights. What made you make that such an important focus of the action - and also not just as a setting where people meet and talk, it's almost like a commentary as we go through the film, you cut to burlesque dancers throughout the film, what is the kind of importance of burlesque in Liberty Heights?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well it's part of the transition as well because it's the end of that. A lot of the other things are all at the beginning and that's really the end of that. It was also the end of, in a sense, the ultimate irony that the numbers racket which ended was taken over by the government and that became the big lotteries that we had and a lot of those people were arrested - the government took for being \"Well that's a good idea, we'll do it instead\". I thought the setting of things that are ending and things that are beginning and also my father, a lot of his friends had been involved on the block where they had the clubs etc and they always had sort of shady kind of, y'know, things that went on. It wasn't like Mafioso stuff, but there were these questionable things. Like a mother says at one point, \"Because it's illegal, but it's not so bad\". I thought y'know, it is a true story, about the guy hitting the money, but would have busted them. In the context of it all, I thought it was the right texture for it.</p> <p><strong>Q7:</strong> Why did you set the black young girl in the school [in Liberty Heights]. I ask this because I grew up in Baltimore, and I just don't think that she is credible.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> First of all, it was real. Actually I am surprised that you would ask that question, because there were, in my year, three blacks. All of them were middle class. Because Forest Park was a middle class section, the middle class blacks went to the middle class school. Rather than the poor blacks who would still be down at Dunbar etc and that part of town. And it wasn't until bussing began to move people from one neighbourhood to another. But at that point in time, it would definitely be a middle class black individual that would be going to Forest Park.</p> <p>Q7: You have it set in '54?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Yes, in '54, the beginning of the desegregation of the school system. I actually took a real situation and she actually, her father was a doctor. So I just took the thing that I knew about.</p> <p><strong>Q8:</strong> How do you feel about the lack of depiction of Jewish culture in British television and film?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I don't know enough about the situation here to really comment on it because I'm not familiar with the shows on television because we wouldn't have seen them in the States, so I really don't know enough to give you a good answer.</p> <p><strong>Q9:</strong> Why did you do Disclosure?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I thought it was interesting to me to deal with the issue of sexual harassment because it became like, the corporation's paranoia of the 80s versus what the corporation's stories in the past might have been in terms of take-overs and whatever, power plays and all that kind of stuff. What I was intrigued by was the politics of that, and I was also intrigued by whether or not you can create suspense, hold the audience together, for two hours and try to get them involved in terms of the tension of it, when in the end, no one has a gun and no one is going to shoot anybody, in the end the guy could lose his job. Just that. But yet you create a world of certain suspense and intrigue and there is no gun, there is no one coming to kill you. So I like that idea of dealing with suspense and using the sexual harassment issue to kind of play that out. So that it becomes all these glass walls, it seems so friendly and becomes a point of paranoia. That intrigued me on that respect.</p> <p><strong>Q10:</strong> Was Tom Cruise your original choice in Rain Man?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I came into the film late. Dustin and Tom had both been signed to do the movie and four directors had been involved and all of them dropped out. Finally I had a conversation with Dustin Hoffman, who talked to me about it and he was explaining the story and I said, \"Oh that's interesting, I don't see what the big problem is\". Sydney Pollack was the last director to drop out because he couldn't figure out how to handle the story. So I came late into the process and so I took over and my big thing was to throw out all the story stuff they had. Let's just simplify it. We've got two guys in a car. I'll tell you this, because every director approaches things in a different way. Sydney Pollack said to me, and for him, ultimately, it probably wasn't the right film to do. He said, \"I don't want to do a movie about two schmucks in a car\" and I said, \"Sydney, I think that it's a good idea\" and ultimately I took out the adventure aspects of it and let's just focus on these two things. The salesman who can sell and can charm, with this individual who can't be sold, who can't be charmed and who you can't really communicate with. At some point it's going to turn back on yourself and you're gonna have to deal with yourself because there is no one else to deal with. And so that's what happened. When we went on the road to shoot it, we just kept finding other things and trying other things as we went along. So a lot of it became improvisation along the road. And to not focus on the issues of autism, because it's not a disease that can be corrected, and yet at the same time, let's not be afraid of humour, because it's also a part of it. And when I spoke to families of autistic children they could tell you stories because it's part of like, almost a pressure release. Because they have to be able to talk about it with some kind of humour, otherwise it's just so difficult for them. But not to be afraid of that as a texture to the film. So long answer to that, they were already there when I came on.</p> <p><strong>Q11:</strong> What was this thing you've got with Cadillacs?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> In many ways because it's the American dream and in these films it is part of that. You go to see the Cadillac and the American dream is there. But all is not well in America, and so in the course of the year of this film, going from rushes. . . that's the changeover from the '55 to the '56 model and the '54 to the '55.. the '56 comes out in '55 and the '55 comes out in '54 - that's the way it works - but that's the dream. So life goes on and the dream is still the American dream and yet we haven't attained that and we still struggle with things. In Tin Men, it was because every Tin Man wanted the Cadillac because that meant they were a success. So it has always been the symbol of success in America, so that I've always used it in one way or another.</p> <p>Q11: Do you have one?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> My father had one, as soon as we moved to suburbia and we had enough money, he got that Cadillac. </p> <p><strong>Q12:</strong> Would you like to make a film about the film business?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I don't know, it would depend on what the . . . I mean I've done it in a peripheral way. . .</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Well, isn't Wag the Dog really a kind of a film about the movie business?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Yes and how politics is the movie business, yes. I mean, so the movie business has crept into everything and certainly politics because it is a show. They need to do very much the same kind of way - they've taken more and more film techniques, in fact some of the candidates even work with directors about how to speak to an audience and what's the most effective way to do that, and so, yeah it does link up. The closest I came to it was this film called Jimmy Hollywood, which I don't really know if it was shown over here. Which was Joe Pesci and it was a really kind of modern Hollywood, which was run-down and derelict, and you have a guy who is really not mentally stable in many ways who dreams and aspires to be an actor, and because of circumstance where people think he is some kind of vigilante, he begins to play out a role and begins to think of himself in those terms. But not the film business, the inner workings of it, no.</p> <p><strong>Q13:</strong> What was your continuing creative involvement with Homicide after you'd actually directed the first episode and green-lit it?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> In terms of scripts, stories that we're going to do, I'd look at rough cuts, make suggestions.</p> <p><strong>Q14:</strong> When are we going to see the last of the series - when are Channel Four going to show them?</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> We've been talking about that tonight, whether the National Film Theatre - if we can't get it on British television - whether we can get the episodes that haven't been screened in the UK. Here, as you can tell, there is a lot of enthusiasm for that, Barry.</p> <p><strong>Q15:</strong> When you shot Wag the Dog, you shot it quickly. Was it strange to sit back and see life imitating art?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Both things, I mean we shot it very fast, we shot it in 29 days, we were supposed to shoot it in 30 but we started going so fast that we couldn't stop, y'know. And we had to do it very quickly and we did it very inexpensively, even though we had big movie stars. And then of course, obviously when events began to be close to what happened in Wag the Dog, it was shocking. To have the fact that we had a girl scout and Monica Lewinsky and they both wore berets, I mean it was. And there was a sexual act that happened in the White House and then ultimately, the bombing raid that took place, it was almost surrealistic how close it was. The ultimate irony of it, in one way and sometimes it's a little bit like, y'know you go, \"Good\". There was phenomenal reviews, except in Washington DC, and secondly the critic took us to task by saying: \"It's a stupid title for a movie, y'know, Wag the Dog\" and suddenly to turn around within six weeks to have Kissinger saying on the news \"This is not a Wag the Dog scenario\". Wag the Dog became a part of the language. And also to take task that we didn't know enough about politics because these things cannot occur and etc etc. All of these things started to occur, so I got a private joy out of that. But it is odd when you do something and how similar things are, that can happen in life. I was pretty shocked. <strong>[ <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson4.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a> ]</strong></p> <p><strong>Q16:</strong> I just wanted to say that Liberty Heights is wonderful - are we going to have anymore Baltimore movies?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> That's a hard question. One, I don't know if, I mean I have certain ideas and I also think it gets more difficult to do those, it gets more and more difficult to do kind of smaller, not that it's small, because it's actually fairly difficult to do those, there is over 5,000 extras and we're all over the city. Most of the things that you see don't quite exist like that. The street with all of the clubs, that doesn't exist and a lot of things had to be faked for the film. But it gets harder to do films about people. Not extraordinary people, just people. And it's harder to sell them and the marketplace gets more, kind of big event, ride films - when you read a review it's a \"real ride\". I'm still of the mind that if it's a ride, you get on the thing and you go for a ride but that the ride in a theatre has to deal with people, it has to deal with character and some of the things that I can relate to. And not that there isn't room for the some of the other things, but that you'd like to have the blend but it is getting more and more squeezed out of the market place. I mean I don't know a James Bond. That's not something I relate to on a normal basis. I can enjoy one of those movies, but I don't know a James Bond. I also like to see the things that I sort of know about, that happen in the society that we live in and the world we live in today. But it gets more and more difficult all of the time. </p> <p><strong>Q17:</strong> What the process you follow when it's not a script that you've originated, what kind of input do you have? Do you rewrite? I know in Levinson on Levinson, you talked about working with James Herbert, perhaps you could just generally talk about working with other script writers.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Ultimately I have to be comfortable enough with the material and with the dialogue and everything else. Sometimes I will change dialogue or work with an actor and fix things if it doesn't sound right to my ear, so you modify and change things, even on scripts that you're not considered a writer. Scenes, etc, a number of things that take place. But certainly in terms of dialogue, it has to feel comfortable enough to my ear because if it doesn't, then I keep thinking something's wrong. Sometimes it's not the performance, the dialogue sticks out as something isn't natural enough for me.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> At that point we have to stop, I'm afraid but we have got a lovely clip of Rain Man for you to end this evening. I'd like to thank the Guardian, Warner Brothers. Barry Levinson for giving us a wonderful new movie, Liberty Heights. I'd like most of all to thank Barry Levinson himself for being our guest this evening. </p> <p> <strong>Sound clips</strong><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson1.ra\">On cuts that the studio wanted to make to Diner</a> (53 seconds) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson2.ra\">On his childhood</a> (1min 28) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson3.ra\">On film language and editing</a> (1min 16) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson4.ra\">Life imitating art in Wag the Dog</a> (1min 41)</p>",
  "<p>On Tuesday morning William Hague reiterated that yes, he really did drink 14 pints a day in his youth. While millions have reacted to this boast with incredulity, I believe him. In fact, I'm not convinced he ever stopped. For the latest chapter of what the Tory leader calls his \"common sense revolution\" contains the first official notification of a plan that could only have been hatched in the bottom of a bottle. The Conservatives' solution to the impositions of what they call \"a European federal superstate\" is to join an American one. </p> <p>Senior Tories, backed by the Daily Telegraph, have long been campaigning for British membership of the North American Free Trade Agreement. At first the plan was to leave the European Union. Now they seem to believe that other European nations will subscribe to their interesting variety of common sense. In their draft manifesto, published on Tuesday, the Conservatives reveal that they want to \"extend the free-trade zone across the Atlantic\". The publication is called Believing in Britain. It would be better christened Believing in America. </p> <p>Quite what the basis of this belief might be is anyone's guess. If you want to know what would happen to Britain as a member of Nafta, you need only look at Mexico. The weakest member of the original pact, Mexico has become a dumping ground for the unsavoury industrial practices Americans want to keep out of their own backyards. Under the agreement, there is nothing the Mexican government can do to stop this: while in theory its signatories are obliged to offer foreign corporations precisely the same terms as domestic ones, in practice they must give them far more. Nafta empowers companies to sue governments for the removal of regulations which might affect their profits. So US corporations have begun suits against environmental protection laws in both Mexico and Canada. </p> <p> W hen the agreement was signed in 1993, its US negotiators promised that that it would generate 200,000 new American jobs a year. Four years later, US government departments admitted that they could find only 1,500 new jobs, while 204,000 had been lost. Some people suggested that the jobs had moved to Mexico, but between 1993 and 1997 unemployment there rose by 2m, while wages fell by 29% and 28,000 small firms disappeared. What had happened was that big companies, most of them from the US, merely expanded their markets at the expense of everyone else. </p> <p>As new members of Nafta, we would not be better off than Mexico, but worse, for we would be obliged to accept the outcome of negotia tions to which we were not party. The Conservatives might moan about Maastricht, but at least we were there. </p> <p>The contradictions between this crazy plan and the rest of the Tories' draft manifesto reveal a political naivety so touching that you almost want to give the poor inebriates your vote. \"To protect the competitiveness of our haulage industry\", the Tories would \"charge foreign lorries to use our roads\". Under Nafta, whose stated purpose is to create equal conditions for domestic and foreign corporations, this would be immediately struck out. The Conservatives' commendable plan to \"return discretion to local communities, enabling them to protect their neighbourhood\" is a precise description of what Nafta prevents. Whitehall, the manifesto complains, is \"imposing an oppressive uniformity and reducing the opportunity for local initiative\". Just wait till you see what Nafta can do. </p> <p>Nor, of course, is there any way in which this plan could be reconciled to the Tories' commitment to defend our \"national sovereignty\". \"We are being guided,\" the manifesto complains, \"by people who believe that Britain cannot survive as an independent nation in a global economy and should instead become a small part of a regional bloc.\" The solution? Britain should become a still smaller part of a much bigger bloc. </p> <p>It could be argued that the Tories are simply responding to an alarming global reality: under pressure from big businesses hoping to become still bigger, trade blocs are expanding and beginning to elide, with the result that national parliaments are being forced to submit to ever more supranational laws. But by insisting that he wants to keep the pound and defend our \"independence and integrity\", William Hague creates the impression that he wants to stop all this rather than encourage it. The Conservatives have long sustained the irreconcilable beliefs that while European integration is bad, global integration is good. </p> <p>If Mr Hague really sought to defend national sovereignty, there might be something to be said for him. But, for all his subtle xenophobia, in truth he is the enemy of independence. If you want to belong to a federal superstate, vote Conservative. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk\">g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk</a></p>",
  "At least four UN refugee workers were murdered yesterday in west Timor and their office destroyed when thousands of pro-Indonesian militiamen attacked the building during a rampage through the area. <p>Several other staff from international aid organisations in the Indonesian territory helping the tens of thousands of east Timorese refugees in camps around the town of Atambua were injured. One Brazilian woman was repeatedly attacked by an axe-wielding militiaman. </p> <p>All foreign workers in the town were evacuated. Some fled to the provincial capital, Kupang, while four UN helicopters airlifted 55 to the town of Balibo in east Timor. </p> <p>Last night, as reports came in that the militiamen were heading towards Kupang, the UN in Jakarta announced that it would evacuate all its staff from west Timor today and would assist any international organisations wishing to pull out their employees. </p> <p>It is unclear what fate awaits the east Timorese refugees who have been terrorised by the militia since they were forced to flee their homeland when pro-Jakarta thugs went on a rampage after the territory voted overwhelmingly for independence in August 1999. </p> <p>Yesterday's attack on staff working for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees began when about 20 trucks full of militia, many armed with machetes and homemade rifles, pulled up in front of their Atambua office, a local eyewitness said. \"They first lit fires in front of the office and then threw stones at the windows and fired into the office,\" he said. \"They then set fire to one of the UNHCR cars before attacking the office itself. The building was destroyed.\" </p> <p>At least three bodies were dragged out of the office in the ensuing carnage, he said. \"They were dumped in front of the building and set on fire.\" </p> <p>Police sources said that an Ethiopian, a Puerto Rican, a Croatian and a Malaysian were killed and that one other person might be missing. </p> <p>The militiamen, who had gathered in the town the previous evening to mourn a murdered leader, were joined by thousands of colleagues and then set off in search of the approximately 25 foreigners living in Atambua. Several buildings were destroyed and locals who had helped international organisations were attacked. </p> <p>Neither the Indonesian police, whose office is less than 100 yards from the UNHCR office, nor the military, made any serious attempt to intervene until later. None of the attackers was arrested. </p> <p>The west Timor military commander, Colonel Jurefar, said his troops could not control the militiamen. \"We tried to quell the situation but some just went wild.\" </p> <p>The UN high commissioner for refugees, Sadako Ogata, said she was deeply disappointed at the failure of the Indonesian authorities to make good on their commitment to protect her staff. \"These were peaceful, unarmed humanitarians who gave their lives trying to help those who had lost everything in conflict,\" she said. </p> <p>Many of the foreigners had only returned to Atambua this week, when the UNHCR decided it was safe enough to resume operations in the area after three staff were badly beaten up in a west Timor refugee camp last month. </p> <p>Sulaiman Abdulmanan, the Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman, said his government was appalled by the incident. He insisted that the authorities were not actively supporting the militia. But diplomats in Jakarta have said they have conclusive proof that elements of the Indonesian military are actively training and equipping the militia.</p>",
  "<p>Tony O'Reilly's Independent News &amp; Media yesterday boasted of the potential of its recent acquisition, the Belfast Telegraph, as the group posted a 22% rise in pre-tax profits for the first half of the year to \u20ac74.5m (\u00a345m). </p> <p>Brendan Hopkins, chief executive of the group's UK operations said the Belfast Telegraph which it bought from Trinity Mirror for \u00a3300m earlier this year would add significant weight to the Independent portfolio. The company now owns the best selling daily newspapers north and south of the Irish border. </p> <p>\"Already we're seeing, after five or six weeks, what a great asset we've bought.\" he said. Contributions from the Belfast Telegraph will be included in its full year results for the first time. </p> <p>The Dublin-based media group restated the company's belief that the London-based Independent and Independent on Sunday newspapers would move into profit next year. The loss-making broadsheets continued to lose circulation but advertising revenue for the titles rose 21% in the first half of the year, with revenues for the group's UK operation rising 18% to \u20ac84m. </p> <p>The results comfortably beat analyst expectations and were buoyed by a strong performance in Australia, New Zealand and its domestic Irish market. Australia's APN News &amp; Media in which Independent has a 41% stake reported a 31% increase in earnings to A$22m. </p> <p>The company floated its wireless internet portal iTouch over the summer after being forced to claw back the offer price and said yesterday that its other new media assets would be kept within the main group. </p> <p>The company said it expected the full year numbers to show a \"meaningful improvement\" over 1999.</p>",
  "Jonathan Aitken yesterday drew on his intimate knowledge of the prison system when he chaired a conference on penal reform, telling delegates about the 90p bonus he earned for keeping the cleanest toilets in the jail. <p>The disgraced former cabinet minister, who served seven months of an 18-month sentence for perjury and perverting the course of justice following his disastrous libel action against the Guardian and Granada Television, was chairing a question and answer session on the second day of the Howard League conference at Oxford University's New College. </p> <p>During a discussion about the disparity in levels of prisoners' pay across the country, Mr Aitken said: \"My first job in Belmarsh Prison was to put roofing screws on to washers. I did that for three weeks and the pay was 1p for every 100 washers and if you were very good at it you could make 10p in a session. </p> <p>\"Being the wing cleaner, basically the loo cleaner, at Standford Hill I was getting \u00a35.60 a week, although it did rise with a bonus, with which I was enormously pleased, to getting 90p extra for keeping the cleanest bogs in the gaff.\" </p> <p>Mr Aitken took the opportunity to criticise the arbitrary nature of prison pay. \"There is a huge variation among prisoners and jobs and there are vast differentials,\" he said. </p> <p>He also joked with the 200 delegates about his interpreting skills in French and Arabic while mixing with foreign prisoners. </p> <p>\"In my various prisons I kept coming across immigration detainees, some of whom were asylum seekers, and the language problem and their inability to communicate across these language barriers was very worrying indeed. </p> <p>\"My own rusty French and Arabic were pressed into service trying to help these guys communicate and their rights were severely damaged by my translation.\" </p> <p>An Oxford graduate, Mr Aitken is due to begin a theology course at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, in the near future.

  "<p>It's all that weather balloon's fault. Where would popular culture have been over the last 10 years without the infamous New Mexico UFO crash seamlessly slipping into an urban conspiracy mythology that includes everything from JFK to Nazi time-travel plots, as well as prompting the consumption of student-friendly alien blow-up dolls, T-shirts and, of course, X-Files paraphernalia? As any self-respecting alien buff knows, Roswell is the Mecca of the ET cover-up brigade, with thousands of wannabe Mulders gleefully booking a room at the Alie'inn every year in the hope of seeing some Top Secret black-budget successor to the Stealth Bomber zooming at light speed over Area 51. Roswell is an established brand name in what passes for the global counter-culture - we all want to believe - so it should come as no surprise that it's now spawned its own TV show. </p> <p>Roswell High is the latest example of fusion television, splicing two popular genres (conspiracy thrillers and teen melodrama) in a surprisingly successful way - it was probably pitched to television executives as The X-Files meets Dawson's Creek. This genetic modification trickles down from the production team, with Jason Katims (writer and executive producer) having worked on My So-Called Life, David Nutter (director and executive producer) coming straight from The X-Files, and Jonathan Frakes (director), better known as Riker in Star Trek: The Next Generation. </p> <p>For this mix and match strategy to work, it's essential that the elements of both genres sit comfortably together . In the same way that Buffy is currently worrying about which college to go to, as well as dealing with the Mayor's impending plans for an occult Armageddon, Roswell High understands that the characters can't hide from the Men In Black without also hiding from teachers when they've skipped their geometry classes. The success of the show comes in the way it plays the two genres off each other. </p> <p>In tonight's opening episode, Liz Parker (Shiri Appleby) is accidentally shot while waiting tables in the local Crashdown Cafe. As she's clearly being established as a major character, there's no way we're going to see her die in the pilot, so in steps classmate Max Evans (Jason Behr) with his entirely useful alien powers, healing her in an instant after a quick laying-on of his suspiciously human-looking hands. Unfortunately for him she sees the whole thing, and wants some answers - opening up a whole can of interstellar worms. </p> <p>As the actual Roswell incident took place in 1947, their high school age has to be explained away first: Max and his fellow extraterrestrial biological entities (sister Isabel and moody friend Michael Guerin) are the surviving descendants from the original crash victims, and were put in incubators and then adopted by unsuspecting parents in Roswell after they emerged as fully formed five-year-olds sometime in the 80s. </p> <p>They've been living undercover ever since, laughing along with all the alien jokes that make up daily life in UFO Central, all the while worrying that they're about to be exposed and experimented on. The trio have formed a lifelong pact to keep their otherworldly relations a secret - and now they have to deal with trusting someone else. But, as with most secrets in high school, it's all too much for Liz to handle on her own, and she soon blabs everything to her best friend Maria (Majandra Delfino). So that they can pass notes to each other in class about their new Major Crisis, they dub the trio \"Czechoslovakians\" (no doubt an alien-enough sounding country from the perspective of the notoriously geographically challenged US teens) and happily throw themselves into fighting the powers that be (the local sheriff, who's convinced that something is Going On) with all the Scoobytastic gusto of Mulder's Lone Gunmen. </p> <p>At the same time, as Liz confesses to her diary, it's just as exciting for her that the previously unassailable Max is now talking to her as it is that she's found out that life on other planets really exists. His dreamy good looks are as important - if not more - to her as his alien biology (though she never quite seems to come to terms with the concept that the two might be mutually exclusive when it comes to physical compatibility). </p> <p>TV drama thrives on providing legitimate reasons to put characters in jeopardy week after week - that's why so many are set in police stations or hospitals. With Roswell High, the writers have made their lives easier by giving themselves two highly potent strands of tension to play with. What better reason to mistrust society and to be in constant peril than to be an alien, stranded light years from your own planet with no real understanding of how you got here, or how to get back (these kids don't have the number to phone home)? And, at the same time, what better place for these unwitting visitors to be hiding in than a high school? Teenagers have never needed to be aliens to feel alienated. </p> <p>\u0095 Roswell High, tonight, 6pm, BBC2</p>",
  "\u0095We welcome Barbara Roche's decision to take a serious look at immigration (Skills shortage prompts immigration rethink, September 4). It is long overdue. Few would disagree that migrants of all kinds can make a significant contribution to our economy and society. One thing the government could usefully do is to examine what needs to be done to make the best use of the skills and experiences of refugees and asylum seekers already in the UK. <p>Whereas it takes at least seven years and \u00a3200,000 to train a doctor from scratch, a refugee doctor can be prepared and converted to practice in the UK in months at a cost of \u00a33,000. For the sake of the health service and for refugee doctors, of whom there are 1,000 in London alone, the government needs to examine ways in which it can ensure these desperately needed skills are not wasted. </p> <p><b> Nick Hardwick</b> <br> Refugee Council </p> <p>\u0095Francis Wheen's diatribe (Babs' split personality, G2, September 6) against government immigration policy unfortunately laboured under a fundamental misunderstanding of the distinction between asylum and migration. </p> <p>Like the UNHCR, the government believes that the asylum system should not be used for economic purposes. It exists to protect people who are fleeing persecution under the UN convention, whatever their skills and qualifications. Economic value does not come into it and nor should it. </p> <p>The government does believe, however, that there should be an open debate about the role managed migration can play in helping the UK compete in a global market place. I will be speaking on this subject on Monday to the Institute for Public Policy Research. </p> <p>I have never described asylum seekers as vile, though this is precisely what I think of the practice of using children as an aid to begging. </p> <p><b>Barbara Roche MP</b> <br> Immigration minister</p>",
  "<p><strong> Bob Roberts</strong><br>(Tim Robbins, 1992)<br>8pm, FilmFour </p> <p>Robbins directs and stars here as a rightwing folk singer turned would-be senator who is adept at hitting all the right notes with an undiscriminating electorate. And the satirical message is wittily drummed in: politics is all about entertaining the masses - and those who don't, like Gore Vidal's rather more decent Democratic candidate, are out of time. There's an eminently watchable cast, including Alan Rickman, Susan Sarandon and James Spader, all of whom help to keep up the tempo. </p> <p><strong>There's Something About Mary</strong><br>(Peter and Bobby Farrelly, 1998)<br>8pm, Sky Premier </p> <p>Poor geeky Ben Stiller. The girl of his dreams (Cameron Diaz) is taking him to the high school ball - until a nasty accident with his zipper ends the romance before it starts. Years later he employs Matt Dillon's sleazy private eye to track her down, but Dillon starts making moves on her himself. Add the shocking-the-dog-back-to-life sketch and famous sperm-hair-gel scene, and it's clear that questions of taste are far from the Farrellys' minds. The funny thing is, it's so funny. </p> <p><strong> Crazy People</strong><br>(Tony Bill, 1990)<br>12.55am, Sky Cinema </p> <p>A comic swipe at the honourable profession of advertising. Dudley Moore, standing in for first choice John Malkovich, plays an ad-man who starts writing the truth (shock, horror) about his products and is, of course, carted off to the asylum, where he galvanises fellow patients, including Daryl Hannah. All a bit obvious, but charming. </p> <p><strong> The Killing Fields</strong><br>(Roland Joffe, 1984)<br>1.55am, FilmFour </p> <p>Emotionally charged vision of war based on real events, with Sam Waterston as American journalist Sydney Schanberg tracing the guide Dith Pran (Haing S Ngor) he was forced to leave to the tender mercies of the Khmer Rouge.</p>",
  "Thursday night is burger night at Fisherman's Wharf. Expats in Gap khakis and Teva sandals gobble up cheeseburgers and Mexican lager. The prices are in dollars. The talk is of Brent crude and oil pipelines. You could almost be in Texas, or Louisiana, except the portions are slightly too small, the meat has been flown in from Dubai and the waitresses are talking among themselves in Azeri - a Turkish dialect that is now the official language of Azerbaijan. <p>This small country of 8m people is on the verge of celebrating its 10th year as an independent nation. It is also on the brink of an oil windfall that varies from large to stupendous, depending on who you are talking to. Azerbaijan's share of the oil reserves under the Caspian sea are estimated to be worth around $80bn, but there could be much more. Fisherman's Wharf is one of many restaurants that have sprung up to cater for the city's sizeable foreign population. It is a reminder of one of the country's deeper paradoxes that the expats in Baku tend to be oil workers or aid workers: either there to make money, or there to dole it out. </p> <p>Fisherman's Wharf itself is a misnomer. There's not a wharf or a fisherman in sight. The restaurant sits in a public park, separated from it by a narrow moat stocked with a few chubby goldfish. While the diners enjoy tequila and chicken fajitas, the Azeris sitting in the park have to make do with the simpler pleasures of Russian ice cream. The moat between the park and the restaurant is only a few feet wide, but as far as the ordinary Azeris are concerned it might as well be the Caspian sea. </p> <p>The average wage in Azerbaijan is about $40 a month, barely enough for a round of drinks at one of the expat watering holes. In spite of the oil, living standards have fallen since the country became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991. And yet, in Baku at least, it is hard to escape the evidence of the oil boom. At a Mitsubishi dealership, Azerbaijan's new elite pay cash for new four-by-fours. Rugged vehicles are prized because they can stand up to the potholed roads. Enormous mansions are going up on the outskirts of the city and the view from the public beach includes an oil platform just offshore: the new money is visible everywhere, and everywhere there is an opportunity to spend it: outlets for designer clothes, sushi bars, numberless basement dives lined with sad-eyed prostitutes from central Asia. </p> <p>There's an odd symmetry, too, about the glut of foreign investment in the oil industry. At the dawn of the 20th century, Azerbaijan produced half of the world's supply of oil. The Rothschilds and the Nobels were among those who made fortunes here. Azerbaijan has been producing oil for more than 100 years, and yet the wealth seems to have flowed out of the country without leaving much of a residue for the majority of its people. </p> <p>There are some elaborate turn-of-the-century mansions in the old city that were built with the first flush of oil money, but vast swathes of the country give no indication of the wealth it is heir to. The president of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, is fond of telling his people that the country is developing with every passing day, and they can look forward to excellent lives. But some Azeris are already sick of hearing they're going to be the new Kuwait. </p> <p>\"Five years ago, they said everything was going to be great in five years,\" says Rasul, a 20-year-old worker on Oily Rocks, a Stalin-era oil platform. This mind-boggling collection of rusty roads and oily wells stands on trestles 60 miles out to sea. There were once 120 miles of roads defying the elements at Oily Rocks, but three-quarters of them have fallen apart. Rasul told me he'd had enough, and was waiting for a visa to emigrate to the Netherlands. </p> <p>On the streets of Baku, unemployed teachers and former soldiers jostle for work sanding the parquet floors of the newly rich. Locals call them \"slave markets\". Cars pull up periodically and after a quick discussion a deal is struck and the floor sander takes his seat in the car. These people are scornful of the idea that the oil is going to bring them any benefit. \"The oil is nothing to do with us,\" one told me. \"We are slaves.\" </p> <p>I had gone to Azerbaijan to make a documentary for Channel 4 about the way globalisation is changing the country. Far from diminishing the gulf between rich and poor, the arrival of the global economy seems to have thrown it into sharper relief. On the same street corner, one man is buying a SIM card for his mobile phone, while another sits in the dust with welding equipment that looks like it might have been salvaged from the Titanic. </p> <p>Outside the oil industry, the economy in Azerbaijan is moribund. The word used most frequently in connection with the country's economy is not oil, but corruption. Azerbaijan regularly heads the lists of the world's most corrupt countries, where it jostles for the top spots with Nigeria, Indonesia and Russia. </p> <p>I had applied for an interview with President Aliyev so I could ask him directly about corruption, not really expecting anything to come of it. But he is keen to project a media-friendly image, and one Sunday afternoon, I found myself at his dacha. </p> <p>Aliyev is a dapper man of 77. He handled my questions with suave assurance. \"Naturally, there is corruption in some parts of our society. This is a common disease,\" he says as we chat in a palatial marble hall overlooking the Caspian sea. He is keen to portray himself as a good tsar, surrounded by corrupt officials. He says that even if he fired everyone who takes bribes, the people he replaced them with would also be on the take. It suits him to say so because it deflects responsibility from him: after all, he has ruled the country on and off since 1969. He is bossy and autocratic - an ill-judged intervention from an underling provoked a furious response as we were walking around the garden for the television cameras. It's hard to believe he doesn't get exactly what he wants. </p> <p>But the expats at Fisherman's Wharf have a lot of time for the president. He stays involved in the oil industry, and is rumoured to deal personally with problems. His son Ilham and brother Jalal are both vice- presidents of the state oil company, which has a stake in every barrel of oil pumped from the Caspian sea. </p> <p>From the viewpoint of Fishermen's Wharf, the main concern is the issue of succession. Aliyev is beginning to look his age and last year underwent heart surgery. The foreign oilmen wish him long life over their margaritas, because his death is likely to trigger an unseemly period of jostling at the very least, and possibly something much worse. With Iran to the south, Russia to the north, and a conflict ticking away with Armenia, Aliyev's successor will have to share his gifts for balance-of-power politics if the fledgling nation is to survive. </p> <p>What all this will mean for the foreign oil interests is still unclear. But if I was at Fishermen's Wharf, I'd think about having that burger to go. </p> <p>\u0095 Unreported World: All the President's Oil is showing tomorrow at 7.30pm on Channel 4</p>"
