  "Rail chiefs today attended an emergency summit with the Deputy Prime Minister to sort out the chaos which saw another derailment this morning and the prospect of months of misery for fed-up passengers. <p>John Prescott was in talks with leading industry figures to thrash out a strategy for \"getting the situation under control\", a Transport Department spokesman said.</p> <p>Just hours before they met, another derailment put scores more passengers at risk when a commuter train in Surrey skidded on wet leaves and slid into the path of another train, which fortunately managed to stop in time.</p> <p>It came only nine days after the Hatfield disaster, which killed four people and provoked widespread safety restrictions.</p> <p>This morning's incident happened near Virginia Water, Surrey, as the 8.21am South West Trains service from Weybridge to nearby Staines derailed at 8.43am, narrowly missing another train travelling from Reading to Waterloo.</p> <p>Railtrack chiefs last night warned of months of misery ahead as speed restrictions were imposed and engineers worked through the rail network making safety checks.</p> <p>Today's summit at the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions, in London, involved Railtrack chief executive, Gerald Corbett, rail regulator Tom Winsor, Alastair Morton, the head of the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority, and representatives from the train companies. A DETR spokesman said: \"They have been called in to give assurances to the government that everything possible is being done to get the situation under control.</p> <p>\"We are seeing passengers' patience stretched. Inconvenience is necessary to get safety right. But it's clear it has not been handled very well over the last couple of days.</p> <p>\"What we're looking for is the industry to agree a timetable to repair faults and for the public to be given maximum information.\"</p> <p>In this morning's derailment, four carriages carrying scores of passengers overshot the platform and were derailed by the points. The commuters emerged shaken but unhurt, with two treated for shock.</p> <p>Railtrack Southern rail director Michael Holden said: \"It's one more crash we could have done without.</p> <p>\"Initial investigations suggest it was caused by autumn conditions - leaves on the line or wetness on top of the rail. Any derailment is a serious incident and we will fully investigate.\"</p> <p>Passenger Martin Groves, 41, vowed never to used the railways again after his ordeal, which comes only nine days after a train hit a bus at a level crossing in Egham.</p> <p>Mr Groves said: \"There was a huge bang and I knew immediately we had come off the track. When the carriage started to turn I thought I wouldn't see my wife and son again.\"</p> <p>Back in London, Mr Prescott's summit was derided by the Conservatives as another \"lecture\". Bernard Jenkin, the shadow transport minister, said: \"John Prescott has been in charge of Britain's railways for three and a half years and it's now a complete shambles.</p> <p>\"He should be asking himself what he's got wrong over that time. The last thing the railway needs is more lectures from politicians about how to run trains on time, least of all from John Prescott.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, railway engineers were working across the network to make checks and repairs. The West Coast line, which was closed between the Scottish border and Glasgow at short notice yesterday for safety checks, was reopened ahead of schedule today.</p> <p>A Railtrack spokesman said that 20 sites with problems had been found by engineers, resulting in nine areas on the route between Glasgow and Gretna having speed restrictions of 20mph imposed.</p> <p>Railtrack boss Gerald Corbett said that other speed restrictions and safety checks across the rail network would mean \"inevitable\" passenger delays over the coming months.</p> <p>The company said instances of \"gauge corner cracking\" - a track fatigue phenomenon thought to have caused the Hatfield crash - appeared to have increased.</p> <p>The short-notice closure of the West Coast line added to the lengthy delays nationwide yesterday.</p> <p>Mr Corbett apologised for the short-notice closure of the line and added that \"in situations like these, mistakes can get made\".</p> <p>Nearly all of the 25 passenger train companies reported delays after the closure, with some passengers needing an extra 75 minutes to complete their journeys.</p> <p>The Royal Mail said millions of letters were being delayed because of the disruption.</p>",
  "<p><strong> My buddy swears that Tony Greig was born in Australia. I maintain that it was South Africa. Who buys dinner?</strong> asks Howard Yappett from New Haven, Connecticut, USA</p> <p>You can leave your cheque-book at home: Tony Greig was born in Queenstown, South Africa, in 1946. He was a tall (6ft 7ins) gangling allrounder - a hard-hitting batsman and medium-pace bowler who sometimes throttled back and bowled offspin. He played for SA's Border province from 1965-66, then moved to England to join Sussex, for whom he hit 156 in his first Championship match in 1967. He qualified for England (he had British parents), and played 58 successive Tests between his debut in 1972 and 1977. Greig captained England 14 times, but was sacked when it emerged that he was secretly plotting to set up Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket. In Tests he scored 3599 runs at 40.43, with eight centuries, and also took 141 wickets (32.20), including 13 in one match in West Indies in 1974 with that occasional offspin. He was also a fabulous fielder, who took 87 catches in Tests, most of them at second slip. When World Series Cricket started (1977-78) he moved to Australia, and when it stopped he began a long career there as a high-profile commentator for Packer's Channel Nine cricket telecasts, a role in which he remains to this day. His brother Ian also played for Sussex and England, and captained Surrey too.</p> <p><strong>I wonder if you can help me. I am working in Germany and some workmates were asking me about the laws of cricket. I tried to remember that funny poem which has lots of \"outs\" and \"not-outs\" in it. How does it go exactly?</strong> asks Tim Pearce</p> <p>That piece is called \"Cricket as explained to a foreign visitor\", and goes like this:</p> <p>\"You have two sides - one out in the field and one in. Each man that's in the side that's in goes out and when he's out he comes in and the next man goes in until he's out. When they are all out the side that's out comes in and the side that's been in goes out and tries to get those coming in out. Sometimes you get men still in and not out. When both sides have been in and out, including the not-outs ... That's the end of the game.\"</p> <p>It's available on a tea-towel which you can get from the <a href=\"http://www-uk.cricket.org/link_to_database/NATIONAL/ENG/CLUBS/MCC/LordsShop.html\">MCC Shop at Lord's</a></p> <p><strong>My husband's great-great-great-uncle was John Wisden, who played cricket for Sussex. Is he also the founder of John Wisden &amp; Co.?</strong> asks AE Sturrock</p> <p>He most certainly is. John Wisden was born in Brighton in 1826 and died in London in 1884. In between he had a successful sporting career as a bowler, mainly with Sussex, and started a publishing institution. Although he was on the short side he was a useful fastish inswing bowler, who once took all ten wickets in an innings, for North v South in 1850. That year he founded John Wisden &amp; Co., which made sporting equipment for many years (that side of it was eventually taken over by Gray-Nicolls). In 1864 he branched out by publishing a cricket annual: 137 years later Wisden Cricketers' Almanack is still going, stronger than ever.</p> <p> <strong>What were the exact dates of Brian Lara's 375 against England in Antigua in 1993-94?</strong> asks Annemarie Kane</p> <p>Lara started his record innings early on April 16, 1994. He came in when West Indies were 11 for 1, with Stuart Williams was out: it was soon 12 for 2, when Phil Simmons departed for 8. Lara and Jimmy Adams (59) put on 179, and by the first-day close the score was 274 for 3. Lara had 164 and Keith Arthurton 25. They took their stand to 183 next day, before Arthurton was out for 47. By the end of the second day Lara had made 320 and Shivnarine Chanderpaul 41. After a restless night, Lara came out on April 18 with 46 needed to beat Garry Sobers's old Test record of 365 not out, set in 1957-58. It was nervy stuff, and Lara was stuck fast on 347 for 18 minutes, during which time he played and missed at Angus Fraser and was then nearly yorked by him. \"Don't suppose I can call you a lucky bleeder with 347 on he board, can I?\" observed the frustrated bowler. Eventually Lara reached 365, to equal the record. Then a swivelling pull off Chris Lewis took him to 369 and a place in the history books. There was a crowd invasion, and a few minutes afterwards Lara was caught behind by Jack Russell off Andy Caddick for 375. In all he batted for 766 minutes, faced 538 balls, and hit 45 fours. West Indies declared at 593 for 5, of which Chanderpaul's share was 75 not out. He and Lara put on 219. England matched West Indies' total exactly, with Mike Atherton making 135 and Robin Smith 175. The match, not surprisingly, was drawn.</p> <p><strong>Can you tell me something about Geoff Pullar?</strong> asks Norman Strange</p> <p>Geoff Pullar was a stylish left-handed opener who played 28 Tests for England between 1959 and 1962-63, scoring 1974 runs (43.86). He made four Test centuries, the highest of which was 175 against South Africa at The Oval in 1960, when he put on 290 for the first wicket with Colin Cowdrey, who made 155. Pullar suffered a lot with injuries - he hurt his knee in Australia in 1962-63, and never played for England again, then arthritis cut short his first-class career in 1970. He played most of his county cricket for Lancashire (1954-68), although he finished up with Gloucestershire. He was nicknamed \"Noddy\", because he was reputed to be able to nod off to sleep at any time. After he retired from cricket he moved back to Lancashire and ran a sandwich bar.</p> <p><strong>Who were West Indies' wicketkeepers between Jeff Dujon and Ridley Jacobs?</strong> asks Anil Pandit</p> <p>Dujon played his last Test in 1991, and since then West Indies have tried out four wicketkeepers without finding anyone who has approached his panache with the bat and behind the stumps. First to try was David Williams, the tiny Trinidadian: he won 11 caps. Although he didn't have much success a batsman, he did play a vital innings of 65 in West Indies' narrow victory over England in the first of the two nailbiting Port-of-Spain Tests early in 1998. Then came Junior Murray, the first Grenadian to play Test cricket (31 caps). There was a brief flirtation with Courtney Browne, the first West Indian Test player to have been born in England (13 caps), then the selectors turned to the Antiguan Ridley Jacobs (21 caps so far). Jimmy Adams, the current captain, also kept wicket in several one-day internationals (but not for any significant length of time in a Test). Jacobs and Browne are the two keepers for the tour of Australia which starts shortly.</p> <p><strong>Can you tell me the scores from the Nottinghamshire v Surrey county match of 1962?</strong> asks Martin Barned</p> <p>Surrey beat Notts by 156 runs at Trent Bridge in June 1962. Surrey scored 380 for 5 declared and 187 for 2 dec. Notts replied with 224 and 187. It was a good match for Surrey's England players: John Edrich, who was to make his Test debut the following year, scored 216 in the first innings, and Ken Barrington 102 not out in the second. And Tony Lock, the balding left-arm spinner, took 4 for 91 in Notts' first innings and 6 for 45 in the second. The teams also met at The Oval early in August, but that game was a rain-affected draw: Surrey made 233 and Notts 86 for 1.</p> <p>Steven Lynch is acting editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

  "The Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica, raised the political temperature in Kosovo yesterday when he called for the province's elections, due on Saturday, to be postponed. <p>He said the ballot, which is being organised by the United Nations, would produce a \"mono-ethnic result\", referring to an anticipated lack of Serb participation in the vote. </p> <p>His announcement came during a summit of Balkan heads of state in Skopje, Macedonia, designed to welcome the change of administration in Belgrade, and to discuss the future of the region. </p> <p>\"I am not sure that circumstances are such that the product of the elections would be satisfactory,\" he said. \"I think it would be better that these elections [are] postponed.\" </p> <p>The statement is unlikely to be well received among Kosovo's overwhelmingly Albanian population, many of whom see this weekend's polls as a step towards independence. </p> <p>Mr Kostunica's comments were a stark reminder of the problems that face the leaders of region after the fall of Slobodan Milosevic. </p> <p>The summit was organised at short notice by the South Eastern European Cooperation Process, a group which brings together eight Balkan states as well as Turkey. The meeting was also attended by EU foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, who is setting the groundwork for the EU's summit on the Balkans in Zagreb in November. </p> <p>All of the governments stated their desire to see the flow of international aid and investment to the region increased, and stressed their desire for renewed cooperation. A joint statement called for the quick implementation of aid packages agreed to under the stability pact for south-eastern Europe in 1999. </p> <p>However, attempts to smooth over the differences were overshadowed by statements from several countries. </p> <p>The Albanian president, Rexhep Meidani, demanded that Serbia pay compensation for the shelling of Albanian border towns, carried out by the Yugoslav army during the conflict in Yugoslavia in 1999. He also urged Serbia to support increased autonomy in Kosovo, contrary to President Kostunica's wishes. </p> <p>Mr Meidani also demanded the immediate release of Kosovo Albanian prisoners held in Serbia.</p>",
  "The IRA statement yesterday that it will allow the \"re- inspection\" of some arms bunkers \"to confirm that our weapons remain secure\" is hardly a life-line for the beleaguered David Trimble. \"Reinspection\" is not the same as opening up other storehouses of the IRA's vast arsenal and few would expect its already inspected weapons to be other than \"secure\" at this stage. Had the IRA been prepared to open up more bunkers, then its statement would offer the first minister some comfort. In the event it is likely to exacerbate the tensions in his party. To the Trimble camp, the IRA statement is seen as little more than a well-timed stunt. <p>So yet again Mr Trimble will step on to the tightrope at Belfast's Waterfront Hall this Saturday, before the gaze of the 860 delegates of his party's ruling council. Peter Mandelson, who has equated Mr Trimble's survival with the survival of the Good Friday agreement itself, will be keeping his fingers crossed that Mr Trimble won't fall off. </p> <p>The collapse of the peace process in the Middle East, when a final settlement at Camp David seemed so tantalisingly close, is a tragic reminder of how quickly peace can revert to war. At the moment, however, it seems that supporters of the agreement need not hold their breath. The high-wire walker is unlikely to fall off, at least not during this Saturday's performance. </p> <p>Mr Trimble, whose political skills have been tested to the limit as he has cajoled a reluctant Unionist party into making concessions that his predecessors would never have dreamed of, knows it would be suicidal to fly in the face of growing opposition in his ranks to sharing power with Sinn Fein without evidence of genuine IRA decommissioning. </p> <p>Like Banquo's ghost, it is the spectre that has haunted the peace process since the IRA ceasefire of 1994. Yesterday's IRA statement only underlines the fact. To date, the only comfort on offer to unionists is the mandatory flying of the Union flag on government buildings, including those occupied by Sinn Fein's two ministers, on high days and holidays. It is hardly the flag of the Fifth Cavalry. </p> <p>But Mr Trimble is likely to survive on Saturday because a deal will probably be hammered out with the dissident wing in his party, whereby the first minister and his Ulster Unionist colleagues in the new executive will gradually withdraw support from the institutions of the agreement, until such time as the IRA begins to decommission in a meaningful way - and this means more than just reopening a few bunkers for re- inspection. Mr Trimble calls the tactic a \"considered and calibrated\" approach. </p> <p>It would probably begin with abstention from the cross-border bodies, which Sinn Fein sees as the doorway to a united Ireland, and culminate in withdrawal from the executive itself which would almost certainly crash the political engine of the agreement - unless, of course, Peter Mandelson steps in and suspends it first as he did so controversially last February. At all costs, Mr Trimble will seek to head off those who wish to specify dangerous timetables and deadlines for decommissioning. The IRA does not respond to such pressure. </p> <p>Unionist delegates also have a pressing self-interest in presenting the face of party unity, however temporary it may be, after the party lost its second safest seat to Ian Paisley's DUP in last month's South Antrim byelection. With a general election around the corner, the party fears meltdown unless it can regain the ground it has lost to Mr Paisley, who taunts Mr Trimble for capitulating to the IRA's agenda. Mr Trimble's own dissidents agree: Sinn Fein is in government, IRA prisoners are out, the RUC faces change beyond recognition - and the IRA has not given up a single bullet. The fact that its guns are largely silent and the province is enjoying a period of peace, however imperfect, it has not known for 30 years, does not figure in the dissidents' equation. Memories of what life used to be like are perilously short. </p> <p>The irony is that the Good Friday agreement has split the Ulster Unionists far more than it has split the republican movement - the IRA and Sinn Fein. Since Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness began their journey to Good Friday way back in the late 1980s, their overriding concern has been to bring the IRA with them every step of the way. True, dissidents left the republican movement to form the Continuity IRA in 1986 and the Real IRA in 1997, but, despite their recently growing strength, neither has heralded the major split Adams and McGuinness have striven to avoid. </p> <p>This is surprising given what their comrades in the IRA and Sinn Fein have had to swallow: participation in a partitionist Stormont government; acceptance of the principle of unionist \"consent\"; and the abolition of Dublin's constitutional claim to the north. But for the IRA, decommissioning, at least in terms of handing over weapons, remains the ne plus ultra. For the IRA to state as it did that it would \"initiate a comprehensive process to put arms beyond use\", and to do so by opening up some of its bunkers for independent inspection, was stretching its constituency to the limit. </p> <p>Yet, as far as General John de Chastelain's commission is concerned, this gesture is not decommissioning but merely a \"confidence-building measure\" ahead of it. The general's remit remains the destruction of terrorist weaponry and to date the government has not indicated otherwise. Destruction is certainly what Mr Trimble's dissidents insist on, too. </p> <p>The Provos are already acutely conscious of the growing threat from the Real IRA. Nothing illustrates the tensions more than the killing of Joseph O'Connor, one of the Real IRA's Belfast leaders, in Ballymurphy almost a fort night ago in a shooting widely believed to be the work of the Provisionals, determined to maintain control of streets where the Provos were born in 1970 and where Gerry Adams has his roots. </p> <p>If Mr Trimble is looking to the IRA for more help, it may be found in its announcement that it has decided to resume discussions with de Chastelain. This may offer some hope that the issue can finally be resolved. But Trimble needs action not words while even senior members of Sinn Fein who no doubt urged the IRA to go into print before Saturday know there are limits to how far they can push the IRA. David Trimble is not the only leader walking the tightrope. No one wants to walk the plank. </p> <p>Peter Taylor was the presenter of Brits, the recent BBC2 series</p>",
  "The expression on the face of the silver-haired man spoke volumes. Through the window of the first-class carriage where he would spend the night, he looked as disgruntled as it is possible to be. <p>That was in Glasgow late on Tuesday; very soon similar expressions were to become commonplace across the country. </p> <p>The first hint of what was to come was at around 6pm. Railtrack announced it was imposing a 20mph speed limit on a 40 mile stretch of train track on the west coast mainline south of Law junction, in Lanarkshire. But there was more: from 8am yesterday this crucial arterial route connecting the west coast of Scotland to England would close for the 120 miles between Law and Gretna to allow inspection of the tracks. </p> <p>Almost immediately the fallout began. ScotRail cancelled its Caledonian sleeper services - the speed limit meant the train would not reach Glasgow before the track closure. With 700 passengers booked in, chaos ensued. In a vain attempt to alleviate it, the company first tried to charter an aircraft. When this failed, they began contacting passengers to warn them of the problems. But only a few were cautioned; and passengers arrived at stations in Fort William, Inverness, Aberdeen, Glasgow and London to be told the cross-border trains would not be running. </p> <p>\"It's abysmal the way we've been treated,\" said Alexander Armstrong, from London, who arrived at Glasgow Central to find the 23.25 sleeper service cancelled. </p> <p>\"Passengers should have been contacted rather than turning up at the station and finding out at the last minute.\" </p> <p><b> Scuppered</b><br> </p> <p>Stewart Francis, the chairman of the Rail Passengers' Council, concurred. \"You simply can't do this at the last moment. Safety is paramount, we accept that, and if there is a problem then lines must close. But information is the key - give passengers prior warning and at least there is a chance then of taking them with you as we go through what will be a very rocky period indeed.\" </p> <p>There was, at least, some sympathy from passengers for train operators. </p> <p>Alastair McPherson, the managing director of ScotRail, said his best efforts had been scuppered by the late timing of Railtrack's announcement. </p> <p>\"We operate the overnight sleeper services between five points in Scotland and London and we have had two or three hours' notice to make alternative arrangements for our passengers.\" </p> <p>For those arriving at the affected stations on Tuesday night who lived nearby, there was a fleet of taxis to take them home. For those from further afield, there was the offer of a hotel room or a sleeper berth. In London, Glasgow and Edinburgh passengers spent the night in the makeshift hotels of stationary carriages parked on railway sidings. </p> <p>Early yesterday morning many of these passengers were transferred on to the last England-bound train to leave Glasgow Central, becoming among the first to sample the day of disruption. </p> <p>At least 15 trains a day make the journey between Scotland and London, and Virgin Trains operates a string of other services on the west coast mainline. </p> <p>Around 40 services and 15,000 passen gers were directly affected yesterday by Railtrack's decision to close the line. Many thousands more were affected indirectly. </p> <p>Outside Glasgow Central, buses waited to take rail passengers to Carlisle. A journey which would normally take 80 minutes minutes would now last at least three hours. </p> <p>\"It is a totally unacceptable way to treat people,\" said Stephen Leeman, who was travelling to Leeds. Passengers tried to transfer to the east coast line, only to be told it was full. Plane services between Scotland and London filled quickly. The M74 motorway became congested as passengers took to their cars and freight was transferred to lorries. </p> <p>But yesterday's train travel chaos was not confined to Scotland. In the commuter heartland of Milton Keynes, station platforms filled with irate passengers as noticeboards informed of delay after delay. The Milton Keynes to Rugby section of the west coast mainline was severely disrupted. At around 9am yesterday the train station was a picture of havoc: a Virgin train stood stationary at one platform; local services were not moving from others. Passengers fumed as the first service to Gatwick airport was cancelled. </p> <p>\"The platforms were absolutely full: commuters, holidaymakers and parents with children on half-term break,\" said Nick Pandya, a librarian. \"People were, understandably, becoming more and more angry. The station staff seemed unable to manage the crisis and I thought they were going to be lynched at one point.\" </p> <p><b> Emergency timetable</b><br> </p> <p>Problems were also to be found further west. Many of Great Western's services to Cornwall were forced on to an emergency timetable as Railtrack imposed a 20mph speed limit between Totnes and Plymouth in Devon. Speed restrictions were brought in in Berkshire and Oxfordshire. For a train operator which has had 14 sections of the track it uses affected by speed limits since Hatfield, it was yet another burden. Great Western said the problems could last for another two weeks. </p> <p>The Midlands, northwest and northeast felt the disruption too as Virgin CrossCountry trains were either cancelled or subject to severe restrictions. Trains from London to the Midlands ran at least an hour late. </p> <p>Services to the northeast from Birmingham through Derby and York were severely delayed. In Anglia, more than 20 separate speed restrictions led to delays of an hour on London to Norwich services. Some trains were cancelled; services south of Colchester in Essex were the worst affected. </p> <p>Such was the scale of yesterday's chaos it made its way in to prime minister's questions. With almost every train operator in Britain reporting problems and hundreds of thousands of passengers facing long delays, Tony Blair told MPs: \"We need to renew our transport infrastructure - but it's a long term project.\" </p> <p>As passengers embarked on their vastly lengthened journeys, Gerald Corbett, the embattled chief executive of Railtrack, put it succinctly. </p> <p>\"It's going to be a difficult week.\"</p>",

  "<p>T hink about the far reaches of the solar system, where Uranus, Neptune and Pluto orbit. Is there any reason why it should suddenly stop? Why shouldn't there be other planets - even if only small ones - at the periphery of the solar system? </p> <p>Ever since Pluto was spotted in 1930 people have speculated about a Planet X, a tenth planet awaiting identification. Part of the reasoning was that Uranus and Neptune, discovered in 1781 and 1846 respectively, seemed to have slight wobbles in their motions around the Sun. Perhaps they were being perturbed by the gravitational tugs of one or more large unseen planets. We knew Pluto was too small to be the culprit, leading to a widespread belief in Planet X. </p> <p>This idea was based on a false premise. When Nasa's Voyager 2 spacecraft flew past Uranus in 1986, and then Neptune in 1989, accurate radio tracking of how its path was deviated by the gravity of those planets enabled space researchers to derive more precise values for their masses. It turned out that the previous evaluations were out by a few parts in a thousand, and the apparent wobbles disappeared from the theoretical modelling. </p> <p>A massive Planet X was ruled out in 1992. But late in the same year a small planet was found beyond Pluto. The discovery, by a team led by David Jewitt of the University of Hawaii, was not unexpected. </p> <p>If our models for the formation of the planets is correct, with a gradual build up of massive bodies from collisions and amalgamations between smaller lumps, then we would expect residual building blocks to remain beyond Neptune. </p> <p>For decades astronomers had argued that Pluto was simply the largest and consequently the brightest of the lumps left at the edge. In the early 1950s the Dutch-Ameri can astronomer Gerard Kuiper had hypothesised that there should be thousands of these in a band at the periphery of the solar system. This was dubbed the Kuiper belt even before the first member was found. </p> <p>Recently it was recognised that Irish astronomer Kenneth Edgeworth independently suggested this in the late 1940s, so researchers started to call it the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt. Now, historical digging has shown that in 1930, just a few months after Pluto was spotted, University of Chicago astronomer Frederick Leonard published a paper in which he suggested that Pluto was not alone. </p> <p>It is not clear whether Leonard understood just how crowded the region happens to be. Right now - less than eight years since Jewitt found the first trans-Neptunian object - the box score stands at 288 minor planets way out there in the belt, with more being added every week. These bodies are so far away that it takes light several hours to reach us after being reflected by their surfaces. </p> <p>Pluto is small by planetary standards, only about 1,500 miles across. It has a natural satellite, Charon, which was discovered in 1978 and is about half Pluto's size. The horde of independent bodies now known range in diameter from about 60 up to several hundred miles, although those are simply educated guesses based upon how much sunlight they reflect. </p> <p>Astronomers have been amazed at the different patterns demonstrated by these new-found minor planets. For example, many seem to have orbital periods (the time taken to complete a circuit about the Sun) which are simple multiples of that of Neptune. They complete two orbits for every three of Neptune, or three for every four of Neptune, and so on. This was not unexpected (a similar effect ensures that Pluto cannot collide with Neptune although their orbits cross), but it does indicate that something systematic is going on. </p> <p>A different population of objects in the outer solar system is called the Centaurs. The first Chiron, was found in 1977. Since then several dozen have been found, ranging up to a couple of hundred miles in size. Some show signs of cometary activity, such as gaseous constituents being released as they come slightly closer to the Sun. Thus it is thought that these are, in common with the trans-Neptunian objects, really giant comets - bundles of ice and rock - largely inert simply because the environment is so cold where they orbit. </p> <p>The Centaurs have trajectories that make close approaches to the outer planets feasible. Such approaches may result in an impact, but more likely would be an alteration of the Centaur orbit around the Sun. Because of this they are unstable, with gross dynamical changes being inevitable. It is even possible that one could fall into the inner solar system. </p> <p>That would produce a phenomenal comet. Hale-Bopp, seen by many people four years ago, had a solid core about 25 miles across deep within its gaseous cloud and tail. A good-sized Centaur coming in to cross the Earth's orbit would be much, much brighter, and there are historical records that seem to speak of such events. </p> <p>Using the new generation of large telescopes on mountain s in Hawaii, Chile and the Canary Islands astronomers are finding that space is far from empty. Pluto may be far away, but it is not alone. It is accompanied by thousands of little Plutinos, the existence of which we are only just beginning to map out. </p> <p> \u0095 Duncan Steel researches asteroids and comets at the University of Salford .</p>"
