  "Peter Hillary, the explorer son of Sir Edmund Hillary - who conquered Everest in 1953 - is trying to ban a book about his failed expedition to the South Pole and back because it could ruin his mountaineering reputation. <p>Hillary, a New Zealander, who took part in an ill-fated trip to the South Pole last year with fellow explorers Australians Eric Philips and Jon Muir, is trying to prevent publication of the book which gives a detailed account of the gruelling 84-day journey. He claims the account, written by Philips, makes him look bungling and inept. </p> <p>The publicity material for the book, Ice Trek, a journey to the South Pole, describes how the trio set out to complete the 3,000-kilometre journey from Ross Island to the South Pole and back, further than anyone had traversed Antarctica. </p> <p>\"This is Eric Philips's account of a very public journey and a very public falling out on the ice,\" say publishers HarperCollins. </p> <p>\"The journey across Antarctica was conducted in a blaze of publicity which included regular phone calls live to a television show and an internet site through which the public could follow the team's progress. </p> <p>\"The venture was hampered by appalling weather, which kept the men tent-bound for longer than they had anticipated. Soon illness stalked the team. Despite this they reached the pole but never completed the return journey. On their return, the tensions between the team members erupted in a very public falling out, mainly between Eric and Peter.\" </p> <p>The expedition, called Ice Trek, was sponsored by the now bankrupt satellite phone company Iridium. It ended when the trio reached the South Pole in January 26 last year. </p> <p>Already delayed by illness and bad weather, they were airlifted back to McMurdo Sound instead of walking as planned. </p> <p>Disagreements between the camp were made public on their return when Philips criticised Hillary and Muir, saying they lacked the necessary skills to fly special kites that were to have towed their sleds for much of the journey. </p> <p>Hillary said he had read an advance copy of Philips's book and described it as a \"jaundiced and self-centred\" personal account devoted to \"revealing Hillary\". </p> <p>\"We didn't get on. It was a lonely expedition,\" Hillary said, adding: \"It [the book] is an assault on me. It is certainly a slap in the face, there's no doubt about it.\" </p> <p>Hillary added that he wanted an official account of the trip to be published, not a \"weirdly obsessive book\" such as that written by Philips. He claims it breaches a contract between the trio not to publish anything within three years of the expedition ending. </p> <p>\"Personal accounts of the expedition were not to be published until three years after the end of the expedition. Obviously Eric has gone ahead and done this and I don't think he is standing by his word.\" </p> <p>Hillary said he was writing his own book but would wait until the agreed three-year term was up before publishing it. </p> <p>But author Philips and fellow explorer Muir say they have no idea why Hillary is claiming the book breaks a legal agreement signed by the three adventurers. </p> <p>Backing Philips, Muir added that it was clear to him and should be to Hillary that the book did not break the contract at all. Speaking from Australia, he added that the contract made it quite clear a book would be written. </p> <p>He had even provided journal extracts to Philips to help him write the book but was not due to share in any of the author's profits. </p> <p>Asked if the book was an unflattering account of Hillary, Muir said it showed the strengths and weaknesses of the team. </p> <p>Philips said that while Hillary might not like the way he was portrayed in parts of the book, at issue was that Philips had described it as an official record of the expedition. </p> <p>A HarperCollins spokeswoman said she could not say what the legal wrangle over Philips's book involved, but added: \"We are confident it will be resolved.\"</p>",
  "<b>Scotland</b> <p>In Edinburgh, a dozen lorries caused disruption on main routes into the city in an unofficial fuel protest. </p> <p>The action came ahead of a planned demonstration today, when scores of haulage and farm vehicles are expected to bring the city to a standstill. </p> <p>Yesterday's protest saw lorries moving at a walking pace on some of the key routes into Edinburgh at rush hour. The city bypass was badly congested for several hours. </p> <p>A spokesman for the drivers, Mark Williams, said: \"The key argument is to get the fuel prices back down in line with other European countries. Just now it is massively out of order. We can't accept the crippling fuel prices any longer.\" </p> <p>However, the Scotland Office minister Brian Wilson condemned the protest. \"Stopping other people getting to work and forcing old ladies to stand at bus stops, leave children waiting for buses in the rain - I don't think there's anything to be gained from any of that and I don't really think it is a very good idea,\" he said. </p> <p>Phil Flanders, of the Road Haulage Association in Scotland, said he was disappointed at the unofficial action, and concerned that it might alienate the public ahead of today's larger protest. </p> <p>But he said there could be no let up in the pressure for fairer prices. \"We're not wasting our time. If we just sit back and accept it then hauliers and farmers will go out of business.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, petrol stations across Dumfries and Galloway reported panic buying by motorists, with some expecting their pumps to run dry by the end of the day. </p> <p>Police were also on alert in Grangemouth for possible disruption at the main petro-chemical complex there. </p> <p> Kirsty Scott </p> <p><b> North-east</b><br> </p> <p> Five men and three lorries threw most of north-eastern England into chaos yesterday, helped by a region-wide outbreak of panic petrol buying. </p> <p>The group reversed their trucks into the entrance of the Conoco and Total refineries at Immingham on the Humber, throttling the supply of fuel to garages from Nottingham to the North Yorkshire border. </p> <p>Similar pickets on Tyneside completed the job for Tyne and Wear and Northumbria, where police held an emergency meeting to keep patrol cars on the road. Police drivers in Cleveland and North Yorkshire were also ordered to limit patrols to safeguard fuel supplies. </p> <p>Officers were called to a garage in Derby where prices were hiked to \u00a32 a litre as scores of drivers from the petrol-starved north-west drove there to find supplies. </p> <p>No action was taken, however, against 80 trucks which reduced the motorway system in Yorkshire to chaos by driving three abreast at under 25mph around the junction of the M1 and M62 motorways. </p> <p>Public support for the blockades was widespread in spite of the misery involved. Peter Turner, the managing director of Rix Petroleum in Hull whose depot was also sealed off, said: \"We're the wrong target but we sympathise with the all the farmers and hauliers, some of whom are our customers and friends.\" </p> <p>At the Hull garage 200 metres from the home of the deputy prime minister, John Prescott - who was celebrating 30 years of being MP for East Hull last night - the \"no fuel\" signs went up at 2pm. </p> <p> Martin Wainwright </p> <p><b> North-west and north Wales</b><br> </p> <p> The north-west of England was running out of petrol last night as blockades of refineries and terminals spread. </p> <p>Filling stations across a swath of country from the Welsh border to the Pennines locked their pumps as tanks ran dry. Long queues formed where supplies were available. </p> <p>There was no petrol in an area extending 20 miles south of Manchester city centre and drivers were finding it increasingly difficult to find fuel in the north of the city. Some drivers complained of steep price rises. </p> <p>Traffic on the M6 slowed as drivers joined queues for fuel at Charnock Richard services in Lancashire. </p> <p>More than 150 Liverpool taxi drivers supported pickets at the Stanlow oil refinery in Cheshire, where the blockades began last Thursday. Taxi drivers also caused gridlock in Liverpool last night by driving their cabs at a snail's pace through the city centre. </p> <p>Brynle Williams, leader of the Stanlow protesters, threatened to blockade the port of Holyhead if refinery managers continued to supply fuel to Seacat ferries. </p> <p>\"We don't like the idea of Irish drivers coming over here with their cheap diesel then working two or three days and bringing over their cheap meat, robbing us of a living,\" he said, adding that Irish drivers filled their tanks with fuel bought in Ireland at half British prices. </p> <p>In Trafford Park, Manchester, 30 hauliers, including reinforcements from Shropshire, continued to prevent fuel leaving the giant terminal which supplies Esso, Texaco and Elf outlets in the region. </p> <p>Last night the North West Wales NHS Trust cancelled all non-emergency operations due to the crisis. Appointments at clinics apart from at Gwynedd Hospital at Bangor and Llandudno general hospital are also being cancelled. </p> <p>Day-hospital facilities are being cancelled from today because ambulances will carry out emergency work only. </p> <p> David Ward and Helen Carter </p> <p><b> South-west and south Wales</b><br> </p> <p> Desperate motorists were being turned away from petrol stations across south Wales yesterday as a combination of panic buying and continued blockades at oil refineries and fuel depots in the region saw the pumps dry up. </p> <p>Motorway drivers faced the prospect of not reaching their destinations after a number of service stations along the busy M4 corridor ran out of fuel. In Swansea supplies of unleaded petrol have been used up. Garages were rapidly running out of four star and there was no petrol or diesel available at any of the city's supermarket service stations. It was a similar tale in Newport with long queues forming outside the one Shell garage that still had supplies yesterday. </p> <p>As truckers continued to blockade the Elf oil refinery at Milford Haven the company conceded that almost all its service stations in south Wales had run out of stocks. It said that some of the larger supermarket filling stations it services require two tanker loads of fuel a day to keep going. </p> <p>Blockades were also continuing at the Texaco refinery at Pembroke Dock and at a key fuel distribution centre in Cardiff. Oil company staff and police said the blockades - involving just 20 vehicles at the two west Wales refineries - were orderly but there had been no movement of any tankers following discussions with the protesters. </p> <p>In the south-west of England, where the Asda-WalMart hypermarket near Bristol was forced to close during the day, protesters were continuing to prevent supplies leaving Esso's Avonmouth fuel depot. </p> <p>The protest was last night extended to Plymouth where militant fishermen plan to join a blockade of Cattedown Wharf, the distribution depot for Shell, BP and Esso in the area. </p> <p>Elsewhere, angry truckers caused chaos in Dorset by travelling in convoy at 5mph through Poole. Among those caught in the snarl up were 30 long distance drivers, believed to be a mixture of French and British who arrived at Poole harbour on the early morning ferry from France. </p> <p> Geoffrey Gibbs </p> <p><b> London and the south-east</b><br> </p> <p> In the south of England hauliers and farmers have been working in shifts to stop tankers leaving refineries as panic buying led to fears that almost half the petrol stations in the London area could run out of fuel by tomorrow. </p> <p>BP's biggest refinery, at Coryton, Essex, was blockaded by protesters, while four other distribution terminals and refineries in the Grays area were also picketed. </p> <p>Fifty drivers belonging to the Kent Hauliers and Farmers, a group set up to co-ordinate the protests, met at Thurrock Services on the M25 at 3am yesterday morning to decide on a plan of action. They blockaded sites, including the Esso Petroleum Bitumen Depot in Purfleet, where a lorry - bedecked with a Union flag bearing the slogan \"Cut UK Diesel/Tax Down\" - blocked the entrance. </p> <p>Moorthy Patel, from the Shell garage in Seven Sisters, north London, said: \"If there is no delivery within the next 24 hours, we could run out.\" </p> <p>But Barbara Peen of BP said there was no real cause for concern yet. \"There is no reason why London garages should be affected,\" she said. \"The shortages are a result of panic buying over the weekend.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile Kent fire brigade has cut all non-emergency calls and community fire safety work for its engines for the duration of the protests. </p> <p> Jamie Wilson </p> <p><b> The Midlands</b><br> </p> <p> The Staffordshire Ambulance Service yesterday imposed a speed limit of 55mph on all vehicles involved in non-emergency journeys to conserve petrol as the fuel crisis began to hit home in the Midlands. </p> <p>As protesters closed Britain's largest inland oil terminal, at Kingsbury in the West Midlands, filling stations in the region reported severe shortages. Despite the introduction of the speed limit a spokesman for Staffordshire Ambulance Service reassured the public that its current petrol supplies would last for another 11 days and the measure had been taken as a precaution. </p> <p>An Esso garage in Birmingham city centre was forced to ration petrol to \u00a310 per person after queues had begun forming from the early morning, and others were forced to close after running out of fuel. </p> <p> Jamie Wilson</p>",
  "In Indiana earlier this week a university basketball coach was dismissed for chronically aggressive behaviour. Such are the bare facts of the fall of Bobby Knight, but they go nowhere near conveying the enormity of this event in the eyes of the US public. There were near-riots in the streets. It was front-page news, led the television bulletins and dominated talkshows. <p>It was, in short, the sort of coverage normally reserved for national leaders. But that is just the point. The attention Bobby Knight commands says a lot about the preoccupations of everyday America which usually pass unseen.</p> <p>Knight is undeniably a colourful figure. His idea of a motivational technique appears to be grabbing his players by the throat. He was captured on video doing just that to a young basketball star at a practice game in 1997 and when the video came to light earlier this year, confirming some of the rumours about Knight's behaviour, it triggered a crisis. </p> <p>There had been numerous other incidents which suggested that Knight had - in the euphemistic parlance of modern US therapy - \"issues\" with \"anger management\". For several years he was wanted in Puerto Rico for assaulting a policeman and the case was only dropped after the local government gave up trying to extradite him. He threw chairs across basketball courts and launched violent invective against other staff members.</p> <p>In May, when the throat-grabbing video emerged, Knight was cautioned and placed on a \"zero-tolerance\" regime, meaning his job depended on unblemished behaviour. The probation did not last long. On Sunday, the Indiana University president Myles Brand announced Knight was being sacked for a string of ugly incidents, including the alleged manhandling of another player.</p> <p>All hell broke loose. Crowds of students took to the streets, burning university regalia. \"Wanted\" pictures appeared depicting the student who had complained about Knight's behaviour in the latest incident, and he was forced to flee campus after receiving death threats.</p> <p>It is hard to imagine comparable scenes in Europe, or anywhere else in the world. Elsewhere, college sports coaches don't count for very much, because college sports themselves are not considered important.</p> <p>In the US, they are all-consuming. Whole towns turn out to watch their college team play, whether it be basketball, American football or baseball. It is the focal point of civic and institutional pride, and in Indiana, Knight was an institution. Knight's winning ways on the basketball court helped the midwestern state hold its head up and gave it something to cheer about. </p> <p>In other down-at-heel towns, in the backwoods of Pennsylvania for example, American football is king. For many young men, playing college sports will be the high-point of their lives. They will be watched by tens of thousands, and their successes hailed as if they were military triumphs.</p> <p>The same goes for secondary school soccer and Little League baseball. They attract hundreds of spectators every weekend, and have become important social occasions in their own right.</p> <p>All this says a lot of good things about America. Parents and local communities tend to be much more engaged in their children and the games they play than in Europe. When I played football for my school in London, hardly anyone came to watch. If an American-sized crowd had turned up to any of my games, I would have been overcome with pride and stage fright.</p> <p>Furthermore, the American obsession with sport is also far more even-handed than on the other side of the Atlantic. Because of a 1972 piece of legislation called Title IX, which forces schools to spend as much on girls' sports as boys', girls get almost as much attention as boys. </p> <p>The results include a well-attended women's professional basketball league, and the best women's soccer team in the world, by far. In Britain, women's football is treated as a joke. In the US, half the nation watched as the US beat China in the Women's World Cup last year.</p> <p>There is, of course, a downside, and it is personified by Bobby Knight. College and school sports are now taken so seriously, there is no room left for humour and failure. If a child is not athletic the sense of marginalisation is all the greater on the nights the whole town goes out to watch the high school team.</p> <p>And then there is the rage. It percolates up through the playing field turf and pervades children's sports like a noxious gas. There is now a recognised syndrome called \"Little League rage\" - a pattern of assaults by parents on umpires, officials and other parents, and it applies to sports other than baseball. </p> <p>A man was killed a few weeks ago after a dispute at a children's ice-hockey match. No wonder Bobby Knight is such an icon. No wonder there is such a furore around his ignominious fall in a sports-obsessed country which has not yet decided when a game is no longer just a game, and when childhood comes to an end.</p>",
  "Fighting erupted between Hutu rebels and the army outside the Burundian capital Bujumbura yesterday as violence continued despite a peace agreement signed a fortnight ago by President Pierre Buyoya and the Hutu and Tutsi political parties to end the seven-year civil war. <p>The agreement has no provision for a ceasefire and the rebels have yet to sign it. </p> <p>Yesterday a rebel rocket hit a barracks, killing one soldier and injuring three, an army spokesman, Major Eduard Nibigira, said. </p> <p>The army fired at rebels attacking Kanyosha and Kabezi, nine miles south of Bujumbura, killing 10, he added. He said the rebels had infiltrated from Tanzania. </p> <p>More than 200,000 people have been killed since October 1993 when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the Hutu Melchior Ndadaye, Burnudi's first democratically elected president. </p> <p>On Thursday rebels killed seven soldiers in Kabezi when they tried to break through the government lines, the army said. </p> <p>Major Nibigira said: \"Tanzania has a big responsibility in everything that's going on in Burundi.\" The army had deployed six battalions on the border, he added. </p> <p>Residents said the rebels had cut off the water supply to Kabezi and Kanyosha and threatened to punish those who went back to school for the beginning of the term yesterday. <br><b>AP</b> in Kabezi </p>",
  "The report of the so-called \"three wise men\" on EU sanctions on Austria has arrived at a distinctly unwise conclusion. It argues that the Vienna coalition government that includes J\u00f6rg Haider's far-right Freedom party has demonstrated a commitment to common European values and upheld so far the rights of minorities, refugees, and immigrants. While the sanctions have usefully heightened awareness of such issues, to maintain them would be \"counter-productive\". The report's advice to end the measures is now in the hands of the French EU presidency. Jacques Chirac, ridiculed again at the weekend by the jejune Mr Haider as a pocket Napoleon, has personal and political reasons for wishing to prolong the punishment which he was instrumental in imposing. But mindful of veiled Austrian threats to disrupt the Nice summit agenda, and aware that many EU members, including Britain, would gladly be shot of the whole affair, France may perforce fall into line. Added pressure is coming from Denmark, where Austria's treatment is portrayed by anti-euro referendum campaigners as EU bullying of a small country. <p>But while the wise men's conclusion appears to meet the exigencies of practical politics, it is essentially at odds with their own findings. The report states that the Freedom party has \"exploited and enforced xenophobic sentiments\" and created an atmosphere in which anti-foreigner remarks are acceptable (Tories please note, as Robin Cook might say). It deplores the \"continuous use\" of libel actions by the Freedom party against its critics (an apparent reference to the infamous case of Professor Anton Pelinka, who accused Mr Haider of promoting National Socialist ideas and was sued and fined). And it warns that while Haider's people in office have kept their noses clean, this may not be so in future. </p> <p>Rather than abolish the sanctions, as is widely predicted, the EU should at most suspend them conditionally. In a Europe beset on its fringes by a rising, regressive agitation, fuelled by EU expansion and integration, over nationhood, race, and immigration, Freedom party clones in Germany, Italy, Belgium and even non-EU Norway must not be encouraged to think that what Mr Haider represents is somehow deemed acceptable. The wise men's call for ever greater vigilance, in part through a high-profile EU human rights agency, is one conclusion that can be heartily endorsed.</p>",
  "European Union sanctions against Austria may be lifted as soon as today. <p>Pierre Moscovici, the French minister for European affairs, said yesterday that the unprecedented but largely symbolic quarantine would end as soon as consultations with other member countries were completed. </p> <p>Britain said it was ready to lift the sanctions at once. </p> <p>Three \"wise men\" reported on Friday that Chancellor Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel's conservative-led coalition met accepted European norms on the observation of human rights. </p> <p>Diplomats said the 14 other EU governments were likely to create a mechanism to monitor the future behaviour of the far-right Freedom party, whose part in the Austrian coalition provoked the EU's action in February. </p> <p>Another course might be to enhance the article of the Amsterdam treaty which requires member states to respect \"common European values\". </p> <p>Denmark, facing a crucial referendum on the euro on September 28, is pressing for a speedy resolution of the Austrian issue in the hope of easing the feeling of some of its citizens that the 14 have bullied Austria on an internal matter. </p> <p>President Jacques Chirac of France, a strong supporter of the sanctions, is expected to distance himself from the decision to lift them by suggesting that it should be discussed by EU foreign ministers at the UN summit in New York. </p> <p>France is the current holder of the EU presidency. </p> <p>The Freedom party's former but still de facto leader J\u00f6rg Haider greeted the imminent lifting of sanctions by making another controversial statement on immigration. </p> <p>He warned the EU against allowing cheap labour from eastern Europe to flood Austria. </p> <p>Speaking at the Zagreb autumn fair, he lived up to his reputation as a firebrand by expressing his concern that eastward expansion of the EU would cause waves of immigrants to swamp western Europe. </p> <p>But as the Austrian president, Thomas Klestil, appealed to Mr Chirac yesterday to allow an improvement in relations, Austrian opposition politicians urged the world to keep an eye on Mr Haider. </p> <p>Mr Haider told journalists: \"We agreed on a common basis to vote on the [EU] enlargement, but we have some conditions which have to be fulfilled.\" </p> <p>The international trade fair featured exhibitors from the province of Carinthia, where Mr Haider is governor. </p> <p>\"If we open our borders, we have concerns about our labour. Lots of cheap labour will enter the borders of Austria and this can endanger our labour force,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Haider resigned as party leader in April in the hope that sanctions would be lifted. He said yesterday that he was satisfied with the verdict of the \"wise men\". </p> <p>\"It made clear that sanctions were unjust and had to be abolished.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile there were rumours in some quarters of Vienna yesterday that Mr Haider would interpret the lifting of sanctions as a green light to make a deal with the People's party which would give him a place in government, possibly as vice-chancellor. </p> <p>The \"wise men\" - the former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari, the former Spanish foreign minister Marcelino Oreja, and international lawyer Jochen Frowein of Germany - were asked in June to report on the situation in Austria, after months of impasse which came to divide the EU. </p> <p>It was their job to get governments off the hook when it became clear that cold-shouldering Vienna while EU business in fact continued as usual was having little positive effect.</p>",
  "News that the government is to launch a campaign aimed at reducing teenage pregnancies should be welcomed (Government to fill gaps in sex education, September 8). <p>The UK has the highest number of teenage pregnancies in western Europe, some 90,000 each year, 8,000 of whom are under 16. We live in a society of mixed messages, where sex is used in advertising to sell products from cars to ice cream, yet there is a lack of promotion for contraception and safe sex. In countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands, which offer comprehensive sex education, teenage pregnancy is low. </p> <p>However, boys need to be targeted as well. Last month's statistics from the Public Health Laboratory Service showed that sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhoea and chlamydia increased dramatically last year, particularly among teenagers aged 16-19. These trends indicate that young people are not getting the information and services needed to protect their sexual health.<br> <b>Christine McCafferty MP</b><br> Chair, All-party group on population, development and reproductive health </p> <p>\u0095 The government's proposals for sex education communicate deep anxiety about teenage pregnancy, or at least the high rate of it in the UK, about which the government seems as embarrassed as fathers talking to their sons. Is not this a highly judgmental attitude for a government? It communicates a sense that teenage pregnancy is a bigger worry to adults than to teenagers. Are we all supposed to be convinced that teenage pregnancy is a bad thing? And have we a right to pressurise teenagers to agree with us?<br> <b>Richard Wilkins</b><br> Association of Christian Teachers </p> <p>\u0095 If health minister Yvette Cooper is serious about cutting teenage pregnancies, a good starting point would be to educate young people away from the idea that the only \"real\" and \"good\" sex involves intercourse.

This would not only cut pregnancies and abortions, it would also reduce sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.<br> <b>Peter Tatchell</b> London<br> <a href=\"peter@tatchell.freeserve.co.uk\">peter@tatchell.freeserve.co.uk</a></p>",

  "The British Home Office minister Barbara Roche said yesterday she was seeking to open a debate over how immigration laws could be changed to cope with Britain's need for skilled professionals. <p>The UK, Germany, the US and other developed economies are all seeing intense debate about possible legislation that would facilitate entry by foreign hi-tech technicians and engineers. </p> <p>In the case of the US, a longstanding response is: \"Why not put resources into educating native minorities rather than importing engineers?\" A similar objection on behalf of all lowly educated residents has most recently been raised in the UK as well. </p> <p>But such legislation also raises a number of new issues. There is already far more cross-border activity and associated enabling regulation in the highly developed world than many people are aware of. The issue of legislation about hi-tech professionals now being debated in many of these countries is only a further instance of what is already being done in other economic sectors that are less visible. </p> <p>There is a set of provisions in the World Trade Organisation regulations concerning the cross-border mobility of professional workers in finance, telecommunications and a broad range of highly specialised services. </p> <p>Such regimes for the circulation of service workers also exist in many of the regional free-trade agreements as part of the liberalisation of international trade and investment in services. The North American Free Trade Agreement, for one, contains such provisions, even though it was negotiated as an agreement that had nothing to do with cross-border flows of workers. </p> <p>Other forms of such provisions are, for example, the sharp expansion in so-called \"business visas\" in the US over the last decade and, on a much more basic level, the new immigration law passed in Japan in 1990 that opened up the country to foreign professionals in finance, accounting, and other related fields. </p> <p>It would seem that economic globalisation brings with it a need for more flexible cross-border labour circulation. </p> <p>These Nafta and WTO provisions amount to a form of \"migrant worker policy\", although they are addressed to highly specialised workers, and the concept of \"migrant worker\" is usually avoided. </p> <p>The existence of these provisions is little-known even among experts on economic globalisation and immigration, let alone the general public. There was no public outcry when these provisions were instituted. </p> <p>When these kinds of provisions are part of an immigration policy, they are far more likely to become known and subject to public debate and scrutiny. </p> <p>And while these provisions are a regime for labour migration, they are so with one big difference: making such provisions part of the WTO or Nafta means an institutional reshuffling of some of the components of sovereign power over entry on to supranational institutions. It would be worthwhile debating whether it is preferably to have them discreetly incorporated into free trade agreements or made part of immigration policy. </p> <p>The incorporation into WTO and Nafta-type treaties of these provisions for the cross-border mobility of professionals and business persons signals the difficulty of not explicitly dealing with the circulation of people in the implementation of free trade and investment frameworks. </p> <p>In their own specific ways each of these efforts - whether it is the WTO, Nafta, or the far more elaborate case of the European Union - has had in the end to address cross-border labour circulation. </p> <p> So the debate about whether or not to allow the entry of foreign hi-tech workers is but one element of a far broader and more fundamental reconfiguring of specialised labour markets under the impact of economic globalisation. </p> <p>It is extremely important that this be done in the form of a public debate rather than discreetly shifted to institutional domains in practice not subject to public scrutiny. </p> <p>We need to recognise that the issue of the admission of hi-tech workers is only one in a long line of such initiatives. We are already doing it with a variety of regimes and a variety of workers - not only with the familiar cases of maids, nannies, and nurses, but also with professionals in finance, accounting and law. And a far larger set of cases are to come. </p> <p>\u0095 The author is professor of sociology at the University of Chicago<br> <a href=\"mailto:ssassen@midway.uchicago.edu\">ssassen@midway.uchicago.edu</a></p>",
  "The call by the Home Office minister, Barbara Roche, for a \"market led\" relaxation of immigration rules to plug Britain's skills gap breached a taboo that has gripped public life for 40 years. But ministers are far from alone in their conviction that the immigration debate has to be opened up. Pressure for change is growing from business in particular and a wider conviction that Britain will lose out unless restrictions are eased. <p>A combination of growing skilled labour shortages across the economy, an under-trained domestic workforce, the accelerating globalisation of the labour market and an ageing population has hammered home the need to open up. </p> <p>While the need to recruit foreign teachers and nurses is largely the result of chronic underfunding and low esteem for public service work, private sector employers are increasingly looking abroad to fill skilled vacancies and ease the upward pressure on pay. </p> <p>Nearly eight years of uninterrupted growth have created bottlenecks and shortages - less serious than in previous upturns, in the CBI's view, but serious none the less. </p> <p>Computer and IT professionals are among those in greatest demand, but shortages are also cited in sales, catering, customer and financial services and construction. </p> <p>One survey showed 20% of company vacancies unfilled due to a lack of skilled applicants and in London, where the problems are most acute, two thirds of firms say they cannot find skilled staff, compared with 15% 10 years ago. </p> <p>Bill Maclachlan, manager of a small London electrical contracting firm, Mac Services, says he relies mainly on staff from South Africa, Australasia and eastern Europe. </p> <p>But the greatest strain is expected to be in the areas of fastest moving technological change. Britain is expected to need around half a million extra workers with IT skills in the next 10 years and other countries will be fishing in the same pool. </p> <p>Using foreign labour to fill the gaps in the market is nothing new and a large proportion of postwar immigration was organised by government to meet labour shortages in public services or industries. After a slump in the 1970s and 1980s, the numbers have again been picking up rapidly. </p> <p>The annual number of work permits issued, the main method of legal entry for non-European Union skilled workers and professionals, rose to nearly 77,000 last year - from a low of around 15,000 in the early Thatcher years - which is roughly the level of the late 1960s. </p> <p>They cover everyone from senior Japanese and US bankers being transferred from one part of their global corporate empires to another, to agency nurses. Most come from advanced industrial countries outside the EU, from which there are no restrictions. </p> <p>But as the labour market has tightened, companies have become increasingly frustrated by the delays and bureaucracy of the overseas labour service in Sheffield, which issues the permits. The government is streamlining the system and testing amore liberal scheme to attract foreign entrepreneurs. </p> <p>There is a patchwork of other schemes under which non-EU citizens can work in Britain. Around 40,000, mostly Australians and South Africans, do largely unskilled jobs under the Commonwealth working visit scheme; another allows 10,000 predominantly east Europeans to do seasonal agricultural work while many more are employed illegally; students have some opportunities to work; and asylum seekers can work after six months. Altogether there are nearly 1m foreign workers, including those from the EU. </p> <p>But there are suspicions of racial bias in the discretionary decisions left to officials and anomalies are rampant. Highly paid chefs are allowed in under the work permit system, while Indian restaurateurs are unable to bring in staff from the subcontinent to keep family businesses going. </p> <p>Two thousand qualified doctors struggling through the asylum system are unable to practise because they cannot afford the specialist language course, even though there is a serious shortage of home-grown doctors, who each cost \u00a3200,000 to train. </p> <p>The obvious solution to skills shortages would appear to be to train more British workers. But Sarah Spencer of the Institute for Public Policy Research says that is unlikely to work because of the lead times involved, the speed of industrial change and the demographic pressure of an ageing population. </p> <p>\"Skills shortages are only part of the story,\" Susan Anderson of the CBI argues. \"It is also about the creation of a mobile global workforce and it's as much about the UK sending people out as the other way round.\" </p> <p>Ms Spencer hopes the government will take a lead in arguing the positive case for economic migrants and highlight, for example, the fact that they pay more in taxes than they claim in benefits. \"Labour migration is the easier end of the debate. What we really need to do is rethink the immigration system as a whole.\"</p>",
  "The government is considering making immigration policy even more market-orientated by making a work permit dependent on a job offer \"at sufficiently high level\" rather than simply letting in people with skills in fields like IT. <p>The need to further streamline the system to meet the challenges of the globalised economy and an ageing home population was revealed yesterday by the Home Office minister, Barbara Roche, as part of a Whitehall initiative to open a debate on immigration. </p> <p>In a speech at the Institute for Public Policy Research think-tank in London she linked America's long economic boom to the 11m migrants admitted during the 90s and warned that Germany's break with tradition by offering citizenship to Indian IT specialists had not attracted the numbers expected. </p> <p>\"The market for skilled labour is a global market and not necessarily a buyer's market,\" said the minister, who noted that changes to immigration policy in such countries as Canada and Australia were also designed to stress flexible and transferable skills. </p> <p>Though the government has already made it easier for people with skills, business experience and good ideas to enter Britain, ministers may now go further. </p> <p>Mrs Roche said Britain could \"make a permit contingent primarily on a job offer at a sufficiently high level, rather than seeking to identify employment sectors with shortages\". </p> <p>Britain could also follow the US, Mrs Roche suggested, in holding \"programmes of induction and guidance. We could attach greater symbolic importance to the achievement of UK citizenship\". </p> <p>Mrs Roche, MP for Hornsey in north London and herself the descendant of Polish-Jewish migrants, was speaking with Tony Blair's blessing as ministers seek to change the suspicious public mood towards immigration this year. </p> <p>Tabloid backed anger has been fuelled by the post-Kosovo wave of refugees and other recent arrivals from south and east Europe and beyond, including Romanian Gypsies and the Chinese stowaways found suffocated in a lorry at Dover. While insisting that genuine asylum seekers will always be welcome, ministers also want voters to grasp that, far from being a threat, \"managed migration\" in the economic sense has a long and fruitful history in Britain. </p> <p>Mrs Roche cited Shami Ahmed, the founder of Joe Bloggs clothing company, and 200 Asian multimillionaires as examples of economic migrants - some refugees - who enriched themselves and the country. </p> <p>Downing Street, which has shown a close interest in Mrs Roche's text, knows it is walking a tightrope. Yesterday the minister acknowledged that the high number of asylum seekers in the last year was \"unfortunate\" because it \"skewed\" the migration debate. </p> <p>Mrs Roche said: \"Asylum procedures are increasingly being misused by those who have no real fear of persecution. This degrades the integrity of the system and rewards the people traffickers. </p> <p>\"I fully understand public concern about the asylum system and about the wider threat to a properly regulated system of immigration control.\"</p>",
  "A case which began 18 months ago amid spectacular claims that a Taiwan-born American scientist had passed the \"crown jewels\" of the US nuclear weapons programme to China ended in a humiliating collapse yesterday when the suspect, Wen Ho Lee, was freed by a New Mexico court after a plea bargain with federal prosecutors. <p>Prosecutors, who had earlier abandoned all attempts to have Mr Lee tried for espionage, also dropped 58 of the 59 charges remaining against him, accepting in return a plea of guilty to a single charge of downloading classified material relating to his work at the Los Alamos nuclear laboratories on to a private computer. </p> <p>Mr Lee, 60, was due to be freed by the court in Albuquerque. He was expected to be sentenced to the nine months he has already spent behind bars during the investigations into his case - most of it in solitary confinement. </p> <p>He has also agreed to cooperate with continuing investigations into how and why he downloaded data on to seven computer disks whose whereabouts remain unknown. </p> <p>If Mr Lee had been found guilty of several of the other charges against him, he could have faced several sentences of life imprisonment. </p> <p>Mr Lee's two children, Alberta and Chung, said in a statement: \"We're delighted that this resolution gives him unconditional freedom, and we believe it supports the inescapable conclusion that our father never had any intent to harm a country that he loves.\" </p> <p>The final settlement of Mr Lee's case falls short of the full exoneration which he and his family had sought, but it represents an extraordinary climbdown by US federal authorities who had initially tried to compare the Los Alamos downloads with the passing of US nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union by Ethel and Julius Rosenberg half a century ago. </p> <p>Mr Lee and his supporters, along with civil rights campaigners, believe Mr Lee was targeted because of suspicions that a Chinese-American scientist was more likely to be a suspect than other Los Alamos personnel. The case has increasingly become a cause celebre among the growing Asian-American community, which now numbers more than 10m US citizens of mainly Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese origin. </p> <p>\"This case has been a huge travesty,\" said Henry Tang of the Committee of 100, a Chinese-American support organisation. \"It has uncovered a fissure in our society that we always knew was there.\" </p> <p>The release of Mr Lee also raises questions about the initial investigation under the former head of counter-intelligence at the department of energy, Notra Trulock, who was quick to voice his suspicions in public and in special briefings with Republican congressional leaders. </p> <p>Mr Lee was fired in March 1999 on the orders of the US energy secretary, Bill Richardson. At the time, Mr Lee was under suspicion of handing details of the W-88 nuclear warhead to China, an allegation which was quietly dropped. </p> <p>Last December Mr Lee was charged with 59 counts of misuse of national security information, but the case began to collapse in August when an FBI agent, Robert Messier, admitted that he withheld evidence favourable to Mr Lee. On August 24, the court agreed to Mr Lee's release on bail, though he was still held in custody pending a hearing on bail conditions.</p>"
