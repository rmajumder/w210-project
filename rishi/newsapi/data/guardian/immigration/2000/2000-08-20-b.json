  "The investigation by Thai police into the rape and murder of the backpacker Kirsty Jones effectively collapsed last night when five foreigners suspected of involvement in her death were cleared by DNA tests. <p>Detectives said they were still holding two Thai nationals. But they admitted that forensic tests had not yet linked them with the murder. Their investigation is back to square one, amid resounding accusations of incompetence.</p> <p>All five, who include three Britons, gave DNA samples after the 23-year-old university student was found dead 11 days ago in a downstairs bedroom of the \u00a31-a-night Aree guesthouse in Chiang Mai. The foreigners were all staying at the guesthouse at the time of the murder.</p> <p>General Aram Chanpen, the region's police chief, said yesterday that tests had eliminated the guesthouse's British owner, Andy Gill, 32, and also Nathan Foley, 26, a dual British and Australian national who dined with Ms Jones on the night of her death.</p> <p>Also cleared of the crime were Stephen Trigg, 27, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, along with Stuart Crichton, 28, an Australian, and Jacquel Wilfried from France.</p> <p>The guesthouse's Thai manager, Surin Chanpranet, 47, and Thai tour guide Abraham Narong, 34, who took Ms Jones trekking days before her murder, were still \"prime suspects\", Gen Chanpen insisted. But DNA tests on the Thais had not proved a link with Ms Jones's death, he said. More tests were being carried out.</p> <p>While the general was giving his press conference, the tour guide, Mr Narong, marched in and complained that four officers had taken him from his guesthouse and beaten him up. \"I was dragged into their van, blindfolded and put face down on the floor,\" he said. \"They were kicking me and standing on me, and told me to admit I was the murderer. Then they took me to a room - I think it was a hotel room - and they took off all my clothes. They made me lie on the floor and were standing on my chest.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I did not want to confess. I did not do it. Never in my life has anything like this happened to me.\"</p> <p>Mr Narong said he believed he had been targeted because he was a member of the minority Karen hill tribe.</p> <p>These latest accusations of police brutality follow earlier claims that the Thai police inquiry into the murder has been insensitive and shambolic. \"The investigation has been a shambles,\" an official at the British embassy was quoted as saying in the Nation, Bangkok's newspaper.</p> <p>Officers failed to seal off the murder scene and allowed a Thai TV crew into Ms Jones's room before the forensic experts had arrived. Ms Jones's parents, Sue and Glyn, from the Welsh village of Tredemon, near Brecon, were also appalled when a detective suggested their daughter had been accidentally strangled during consensual sex. The police later said the case was still being treated as murder.</p> <p>According to unconfirmed reports, Thai police are now interviewing three new suspects, one of whom is a foreigner. They are also anxious to trace the driver of a motorised tuktuk rickshaw, who dropped Ms Jones off at the guesthouse after she left a night-time bazaar. He may have been the last person to see her alive.</p> <p>Gen Chanpen said that two more Thai witnesses who had heard screams at 1am had come forward.</p> <p>The police chief said he understood the frustration at the slow pace of the investigation but he insisted that everything possible was being done. He also promised that the accusations of brutality would be investigated fairly.</p> <p>He added: \"Along with all of Thailand, I feel very sorry about what happened. I am very upset.\"</p> <p>Ms Jones, who had spent three months backpacking in Thailand on route to Australia, will be buried during a public funeral service this week, her father said. Preparations will be finalised when it is known whether or not the Cardiff coroner will want to hold his own investigation into the circumstances of her death.</p> <p>Last night the guesthouse's owner, Mr Gill, was still in custody after being unable to raise the money to pay for his required deportation. He is being held in Chiang Mai prison after allegedly overstaying the time permitted on his visa by two years. Mr Crichton and the guesthouse manager, Mr Chanpranet, are also still in custody, on drugs charges.</p>",
  "Scottish devolution is justified by Edinburgh alone. If there were no other arguments in favour of a Caledonian parliament, the place in which it is situated would be reason enough. For Edinburgh is obviously a capital city. The hills give it a natural grandeur. Its castle is exactly what every romantic schoolboy thinks a castle ought to be. Its commercial buildings are built on the grand scale. And the men who rebuilt Edinburgh in the 18th and 19th centuries - admittedly, mostly Hanoverian enthusiasts for the union - made it monumental. There is no city in the world that more visibly celebrates its favourite sons in statues, obelisks and Corinthian columns. Edinburgh leaves the visitor in no doubt that it is at the heart of a nation. <p>Forty years ago, when I first visited the festival - Jacob Epstein in the Waverley station underground car park and Albert Finney in John Osborne's Luther - Scottish claims to nationhood were represented by an elderly lady who stood outside the National Gallery and offered passing pedestrians tracts about William Wallace and Robert the Bruce. Even pipers on adjacent street corners thought she was crazy. Her ambition for independence has not been fulfilled. And, if the Scots are as sensible a people as I believe them to be, that is how it will remain. But no one can visit the capital without realising that devolution has made a difference. </p> <p>Scotland was always another country - different from the other nations of the union. Many years ago I made that sage observation to John Smith as we drove through Edinburgh's Haymarket and he congratulated me on my belated perception in terms that would be inappropriate to this column. I think that he would now agree that the formal fact of devolution, although not increasing the differences, has accentuated them to the point at which they are instantly obvious to even the most insensitive Sassenach. </p> <p> The style of government is profoundly different from the Westminster pattern. It has all the friendly informality that ought to characterise a system devised to bring people and politicians closer together. That tone was typified by Donald Dewar, the first minister, searching in his wallet for the price of entry to a festival event until he was told that he was a guest. Then he accused himself of \"gate-crashing\". I have known chairmen of rural district councils to demand more deference. Yet Dewar and co treat the governance of Scotland with an invincible solemnity. More important, the public and press now take it for granted. </p> <p>For most of August, the Scottish political media have been rightly preoccupied with the failure of the examination authority to notify school-leavers of their results on time or accurately. In some ways the political reaction has been predictable - weak-minded calls for ministerial resignations versus the insistence that autonomous agencies must take responsibility for their own mistakes. I never heard the suggestion that the problem would have been avoided had Scottish education remained under the ministerial supervision of a Whitehall-based secretary of state. Devolution is accepted as the natural order of things. </p> <p>And the more Scotland does as Scotland chooses - irrespective of opinion south of the border - the more popular devolution will become. The prohibition of hunting with dogs (largely irrelevant since it is not a regular Scottish pastime) and the repeal of section 28 (more popular than Brian Souter makes out, but unpopular nevertheless) may not be central to the life of the average Scot. But they have helped the devolved parliament to demonstrate its independence. The more differently it behaves, the more its powers will be envied by the regions of Great Britain. </p> <p>Last week a junior minister - so little known that I could not discover to which of the coalition parties she belonged - launched the Scottish executive's policy statement on support for culture and the arts. I have no view on its merits. For all I knew, the folk singer who appeared on late-night television was right to complain that the national bagpiping school was being given more support than it needed or deserved. But what would the south-west of England give for an arts and culture policy of its own? And is it any surprise that, on the other side of Hadrian's Wall, the north-east is saying that it should have its own policy for industrial development that - like the Scots - it can promote for itself in Brussels? </p> <p>Scottish devolution is a proper recognition of nationhood. It is also a demonstration of the need for some policies to be determined by and for smaller areas than the UK as a whole. Its success is bound to be contagious. Regions do not have capitals to match Edinburgh, nor the national identity it represents. So they will have to rely on the other reasons for taking power from Whitehall and Westminster. There are enough to make the case for devolution irresistible. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Harry Oppenheimer, the billionaire South African mining magnate who oversaw a gold and diamond empire stretching from Johannesburg to the City of London, has died aged 91. <p>The man they called \"Multinational Harry\", whose family firms dominated the South African economy and the world gold and diamond markets for most of the last century, died at a Johannesburg hospital on Saturday night. </p> <p>He had been admitted on Friday night, complaining of stomach pains and a severe headache. The cause of death is unknown. </p> <p>Oppenheimer took over the helm of family businesses - the gold mining conglomerate, Anglo-American and the diamond marketing cartel, De Beers in 1957, at the age of 49. When Anglo American, founded by his father Sir Ernest Oppenheimer in 1917, grew too large and powerful for the limited confines of South Africa, Oppenheimer nurtured it into the world's largest mining company. </p> <p>He was widely credited with the stroke of marketing genius behind the De Beers campaign promoting diamonds as the ultimate gift of love. The advertising blitz culminated in De Beers' famous \"A Diamond is Forever\" campaign. </p> <p>Oppenheimer built a reputation as an audacious corporate operator who used his network of rich and influential contacts to avoid the economic isolation apartheid brought upon his native country. Julian Ogilvie Thompson, Anglo American chairman, described him yesterday as \"one of South Africa's greatest sons\". </p> <p>Tributes flooded in from all sides of the South African political spectrum for Oppenheimer who served as an MP for the opposition United party in South Africa's parliament from 1948 to 1957, as the ruling Nationalist party laid the foundations of the apartheid system. </p> <p>A pragmatist, Oppenheimer was a long-time advocate of reforming the apartheid system, but he was no radical, envisaging at best a limited franchise for the black majority. </p> <p>\"We wish to acknowledge the contribution Mr Oppenheimer made in building the economy of our country, as well as the role he and his company played in creating employment for hundreds of thousands of South Africans as well as citizens of our neighbouring countries,\" ANC spokesman Nat Serache said in a statement. </p> <p>\"Harry Oppenheimer was a man of great intellect, huge personal charm and extraordinary generous philanthropy,\" said Tony Leon, leader of the opposition Democratic party. \"He was also first and foremost a non-racial liberal.\" </p> <p>But the economic success of his firms was also considered crucial to the survival of the apartheid government, which ruled until South Africa's first all-race elections in 1994. </p> <p>His labour-intensive mines thrived on the migrant labour system that forced black workers to live apart from their families in worker hostels. His companies paid black workers far less than its white employees. </p> <p>Oppenheimer's retirement at the end of 1984 as the head of the De Beers mining group, just two years after relinquishing the same office at Anglo American, marked the end of his active control in the family businesses. He lived to see the listing of Anglo American in London and its immediate ranking in the top 25 of the FTSE 100 index in June 1999, with a market capitalisation of $12 bn - a far cry from the \u00a31m his father had used to set up the company 82 years before. </p> <p>Few observers doubt that the chairmanship of Anglo and De Beers will eventually pass to Harry's only son Nicholas (Nicky) Oppenheimer, currently head of De Beers' London-based diamond marketing arm, Central Selling Organisation.</p>",
  "Harry Oppenheimer, who has died aged 91, was South Africa's foremost industrialist for nearly 40 years, and the last of the latter-day \"Randlords\". <p>Although by the mid-1980s he had relinquished formal control of the two great strands in his business empire, the Anglo American Corporation and De Beers Consolidated Mines, he continued to exercise a daily influence as the grand old man of South African mining, and remained a De Beers director until 1994. </p> <p>Long feted in the west as a singular beacon of reform, his vast interests in gold, platinum, diamonds and coal nevertheless stoked the economic engine that maintained the ability of the regime to survive and prosper for the white minority. As he himself remarked in 1984, when beginning to disengage from the business: \"In a South African context I may seem to be a liberal, but at heart I'm just an old-fashioned conservative.\" </p> <p>But as a canny and ruthless operator, Oppenheimer was also one of the first South African businessmen to realise in the early 1980s that dialogue with the African National Congress was not only prudent but inevitable. His prescience paid off, for it was those early contacts that contributed to the ANC's long march away from any thought of nationalising the country's mining industry. </p> <p>On a personal level, Oppenheimer was a self-effacing, very private family man with a record of philanthropy that seemed out of place in the hard world of international mining and finance. Despite the miserable conditions and poor wages of the tens of thousands of migrant labourers who worked the mines, he portrayed himself as a gentleman Anglophile, and had an ability to beguile his critics with either dignified silence or pained politeness. This character, together with his enormous financial clout, enabled him to navigate the treacherous waters of apartheid South Africa. </p> <p>Oppenheimer was born in the De Beers company town of Kimberley, the site of the famous diamond \"big hole\", six years after the death of the De Beers founder and empire-builder Cecil Rhodes. He came from a family of prosperous German Jews who emigrated to London and South Africa in the 1890s to work in the diamond business. His father, Ernest, a naturalised Briton, Anglican convert, and future mayor of Kimberley, was in the process of capturing control of the De Beers diamond production and sales through the London syndicate which produced the world's most enduring, secretive and sophisticated cartel. </p> <p>Like many offspring of wealthy \"English\", as opposed to Boer, families, Oppenheimer was sent to public school in England. After Charterhouse, he moved on to Christ Church, Oxford, and then joined the boards of both De Beers and the Anglo American Corporation, which Ernest had set up in 1917 to control the group's gold, coal and industrial interests. </p> <p>At the outbreak of the second world war, Oppenheimer joined the 4th South African armoured car regiment as a brigade intelligence officer, working with the British Army in North Africa. In 1940, having transferred to Coastal Command, he met Signals Lieutenant Bridget McCall, on a posting to Robben Island. They married in 1943, and the following year Oppenheimer resigned his commission and became managing director of Anglo-American. </p> <p>Like his father, whose career and personality he mirrored in so many ways, Oppenheimer also launched himself into politics. In the 1948 elections that propelled the Nationalists into power, he stood for General Smuts' United Party in Kimberley, becoming the second \"Member for De Beers\" and the leading opposition spokesman on economic affairs. In that same year the Oppenheimers' New York advertising agency coined the immortal slogan: \"A diamond is forever.\" </p> <p>In public, Oppenheimer's wealth and power attracted the odium of the Afrikaner Nationalists - just as his father had to suffer the anti-Semitic nickname Hoggenheimer, portrayed as the silk-hatted and bloated Jewish capitalist. But far from being disloyal, Oppenheimer began co-operating with the government on its uranium development programme for the US and Britain. </p> <p>On his father's death in 1957, Oppenheimer left parliament to assume control of the family businesses. In 1959 he joined the new Progressive Party, which he financed personally. His politics during these years were cautiously reformist. He did not think that apartheid was morally wrong, and believed that separation of the races was necessary to maintain white civilisation. But he did recognise pragmatically that blacks had legitimate demands to participate in the economic growth of the country - and his companies - and he consistently urged more flexible labour laws. It was no coincidence that Harold Macmillan dined with the Oppenheimers on the eve of his \"wind of change\" speech. </p> <p>In response to the black unrest of the late 1950s and early 1960s, Oppenheimer sought to reassure the international community that South Africa was still a good investment risk. He helped set up the South Africa Foundation after the Sharpeville massacre of 1961, and then, after the 1976 Soweto uprising, the Urban Foundation, which poured millions of rands into welfare and housing schemes for blacks. </p> <p>But throughout his stewardships of South Africa's largest conglomerate - worth more than 50% of the Johannesburg stock exchange - conditions in the mines for migrant black workers were overcrowded and brutal; wages hovered around the poverty line and racism among the white managers was the norm. But for all that he was still prepared to meet and treat with the miners' militant leaders, even engaging in civilised public debate with the NUM's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, over white wine and canapes at the Market Theatre in Johannesburg in 1986. </p> <p>In his private life Oppenheimer could retreat to his beautiful Dutch colonial-style mansion of Brenthurst on the outskirts of Johannesburg, where in 1984 he opened an opulent private library of Africana. His own study, with its collection of Romantic poets and first editions, overlooked a gentle lily pond. </p> <p>Oppenheimer is survived by his wife, a daughter, Mary, and a son, Nicholas. </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 Harry Frederick Oppenheimer, industrialist, born October 28 1908; died August 19 2000</p>",
  "<p>Have secretarial skills, will travel. Demand for British secretaries abroad - and for foreign secretaries in this country - has never been greater and incentives are increasing by the month. So if you're suffering from that annual August urge not only to holiday abroad, but to stay there, you could be in luck. </p> <p>\"Not only is computer technology making secretarial work similar the world over, but businesses themselves are becoming increasingly global,\" says Lisa Hilton, a business manager at global recruitment agency Manpower, which has 3,200 offices in 50 countries. \"They want staff to reflect that.\" </p> <p>Manda Ritchie, an international recruitment consultant, believes there are additional reasons. \"British companies are expanding overseas at a higher rate than ever. That means there is increasing opportunity for British secretaries to work away without learning another language,\" she says. \"Foreign secretaries have more opportunities to come here because of the opening up of Europe: approximately 40,000 arrived last year on a working visa. Finally, cheap air fares - even to destinations like Oz - are encouraging people from practically every western country to pack their bags.\" </p> <p>And why go for the usual nomadic jobs, such as nannying and bar work, when you can make a packet, as well as improve your office skills, by turning your hand to administration? </p> <p>\"Five people from my circle of university-leaving friends did it,\" says graduate Sarah Miggs, 22, who worked as a temp in Brussels for a year. \"It's a great way to discover a bit of the world, while at the same time getting experience in areas like IT and communication, which proves invaluable in practically every future job.\" </p> <p>Like most secretaries with a touch of wanderlust, Miggs applied for work once she had arrived at her destination. But if your travelling dreams require more safety nets, fear not. It is increasingly possible to arrange short or long-term placements before you've even posed for your passport snapshot. </p> <p>For high-flyers, recruitment consultancy Angela Mortimer is currently sponsoring the Mountbatten Scheme. \"This offers graduates the opportunity to complete up to 12 months' work experience and study in New York as a PA,\" explains Annabel Lindsay, head of the graduate and college leaver division. \"If successful, the graduate comes away with a certificate in international business practice. In a world where employers are looking for candidates who can bring more to a company than just a good degree and two weeks' office experience, it is extremely worthwhile.\" She admits, however, that securing one of the 150 annual places is increasingly tough. </p> <p>Sarah Kennedy, 22, who found out about the scheme after her friend returned from an interview at Angela Mortimer clutching a leaflet, agrees. \"My stint was as a PA to three lawyers in a large law firm on Seventh Avenue and I walked into a job as marketing administrator at KPMG in London upon my return. They recognised that a secretarial role in New York is demanding, incredibly fast-paced, and often quite scary. If I could cope with that, they probably realised I was worth investing in.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, international agency Drake offers a less graduate-driven option, giving all temps the chance not only to work in a range of countries, but to build up their \"Drake passport\", consisting of typing skills, IT experience and references. \"For people working abroad, it can be difficult to have an easily verifiable track record. This aims to change that,\" says Lee-Anne Van Heer Den, temporary consultant at Drake UK. </p> <p>Increasingly, British recruitment agencies are teaming up with other consultancies around the world to set up exchange programmes. \"The consultancy we deal with happens to be in Sydney,\" says Amanda Fone, director of Angela Mortimer. Any British secretary on their books simply needs to enquire whether there is anything available \"down under\": \"If you tell us you're off to Australia at the weekend, there's every chance we could have a placement ready for you the following week,\" she says. </p> <p>Similarly, administration staff with the travel bug can take advantage of the larger recruitment consultancies setting up offices abroad. \"We have 3,000 offices across 52 countries,\" says Angela Lewis, resource manager at Adecco. \"All applicants have to do is approach any Adecco office for our worldwide guide and then telephone the head office in the country they're interested in to arrange to have an application form mailed to them.\" </p> <p>But make sure you know the facts before you pack your bags. Among the questions you should be asking is whether it is legal for British people to work in your chosen country. If yes, what documentation will you need and what financial arrangements must you make? Should your CV be in a different format? What is the employment rate like and will you be guaranteed work for a particular length of time? Manda Ritchie suggests finding out as much as possible from the embassy or consulate. \"They can give you information on work permits, accommodation and employment,\" she explains. </p> <p>Australia is the current hot spot for travelling secretaries, with Melbourne a firm favourite. Provided you have a work visa, it is legal to work there for three months at a stretch. In other countries, however, doing anything other than voluntary work could be overstaying your welcome. </p> <p>Philippe Milloux, deputy head of the French Institute in London, claims it's worth enquiring how much you can expect to be paid after tax. In Ireland, for instance, income tax can hit you like a slap in the face. And in France you could get paid half what you would expect here. \"Mind you, in Paris you can rent a flat for a month for what you might pay for a week in London,\" stresses Milloux. </p> <p>You'll also want to consider quali fications. Julie Holmes, business development manager for the Netherlands at recruitment agency Crone Corkill, points out that PA roles in Holland are less secretarial and more assistant-based. \"It's not unusual for a PA to the head of marketing to have a degree in marketing and to be given their own projects,\" she points out. </p> <p>A major concern for travelling secretaries is what kind of language skills will be expected. This entirely depends on the consultancy and country in question, the size of the company, the nature of your position, and the sector. Finance and banking, fashion and cosmetics, and management consultancy, for example, are more likely to require some knowledge of the local language. But even if you find work in a foreign-speaking country that doesn't require you to know the language, it is worth attempting to learn the basics. Not only is it polite but it will improve your social life. </p> <p>A little prior knowledge can also help to overcome tricky cultural differences, says Angelena Boden, author of The Cultural Gaffes Pocketbook (Management Pocketbooks, \u00a36.99). First names, for instance, are still not used in certain areas of the continent. And even apparently international gestures such as nodding or shaking your head can lead to confusion: in Bulgaria and parts of Greece, Turkey and Iran, for instance, \"yes\" is signalled by a lateral head sway, which can easily be confused with a shake of the head. </p> <p>\"Germans have a much more direct attitude than the English, and you've got to be able to handle that and not be offended,\" adds Cathy Fawcett, a senior consultant at Language Recruitment Services. \"Meanwhile, Spanish and Italians are flamboyant. The stiff upper-lipped English secretary who winds up there could find him or herself booking a return flight within a week.\" </p> <p> <strong>Case studies: a Melburnian in London and a Londoner in Melbourne</strong></p> <p><strong> Natalie Doherty</strong> , 27, from Melbourne, is currently working as an office manager for KiCap Management in London </p> <p>'Having spent a couple of months touring Africa en route, I arrived in London and signed up with Joslin Rowe. They got me secretarial work pretty much immediately. Most of the assignments were fairly brief, because that's what I'd asked for. I figured it would be the best way to meet people and to get time off in between to discover England. I was right. I made a lot of lasting friends and had loads of fun. </p> <p>\"It also enabled me to learn a great deal about different computer systems, which I wanted to show off on my CV, and gave me huge confidence. Now, if I go into a job and they say, 'We assume you're familiar with system x ,' my reply is, 'No, but I can assure you I'll know it back to front within a couple of days.' </p> <p>\"People often think that secretarial work is boring, but I've met clients, organised conferences in Paris and Dublin, and been given lots of responsibility. It helps that I've had great jobs. </p> <p>\"Eventually, I settled down in a more permanent assignment at a company called Fidelity Investments - they've offered me a job in their Sydney offices when I get back in October.\" </p> <p><strong> Elizabeth Holmes </strong> , 28, from London, recently worked as a secretary in Melbourne. She now works as a senior contracts sales consultant for ASR in London </p> <p>First stop, Sydney. I had no money, no friends, no accommodation. </p> <p>\"But Adecco saved the day by getting me secretarial temporary work straight away. [At work] I met two girls who I moved into a flat with in Bondi Beach. Life was a ball, which was helped no end by my fantastic salary. My employer even put me on the payroll so that he could keep me on for a while. </p> <p>\"After a few months, when I'd saved enough money, I travelled all over Australia and wound up in Melbourne. Once again, I had no dosh and nowhere to live. </p> <p>\"I stuffed envelopes for two days and then I got a brilliant secretarial post with the Melbourne Institute of Technology. They, too, gave me a contract and kept me on for the whole of the rest of my stay - which was six months. </p> <p>\"I learned so many skills that I came back to England and got a senior role. In fact, the Institute said they would sponsor me to stay in Oz if I wanted.

  "After leading East Timor's guerrillas for most of the 25-year struggle that culminated last year in freedom from Indonesia, Jose Alexandre \"Xanana\" Gusmao yesterday retired as their commander to concentrate on guiding the nation towards full independence. <p>Speaking at a ceremony in the town of Aileu, 25 miles south of Dili, Mr Gusmao made a thinly-veiled attack on the UN for the fact that his Falantil forces are not being allowed to do more to combat incursions by Indonesian paramilitaries into East Timor in recent weeks. The clashes left two peacekeepers dead and several injured. </p> <p>In an indication that Mr Gusmao, 53, is moving towards becoming East Timor's first elected president in polls expected next year, he said his retirement was \"part of the process of preparing East Timor for independence\". </p> <p>\"I believe I can play some role in the political process and I must do that as a civilian,\" said Mr Gusmao, who handed over command to his deputy, Taur Matan Ruak. </p> <p>A former poet and seminarian, Mr Gusmao joined Falantil shortly after Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975.

  "For nearly a century, human visitors to the North Pole have found a frozen featureless scene covered in thick ice. Until now. <p>Earlier this month, a group of international scientists aboard a Russian icebreaker arrived at the pole to find not ice but a stretch of open water at least one mile wide, with ivory gulls flying overhead. </p> <p>Since Robert Peary led the first expedition to the top of the world on foot, no one has ever before found a watery pole, or birds flying in the Arctic air, and it is 50m years since scientists can be certain that the pole was last definitively awash. </p> <p>\"It was totally unexpected,\" Dr James McCarthy, a Harvard University oceanographer, told the New York Times at the weekend. \"There was a sense of alarm. Global warming was real, and we were seeing its effects for the first time that far north.\" </p> <p>\"I don't know if anybody in history ever got to 90 degrees north to be greeted by water, not ice,\" said paleontologist Malcolm McKenna of the American Museum of Natural History. </p> <p>Six years ago, when he last sailed to the pole in an icebreaker, Dr McCarthy recalled, the vessel ploughed through an ice-cap between 6ft and 9ft thick at the pole. </p> <p>On his latest visit, the icebreaker Yamal crunched its way through miles of unusually thin ice. Scientists could see through the ice to plankton which were able to grow in unaccustomed sunlight. When the ship reached the pole, water was lapping its bows. </p> <p>The Russian captain of the Yamal told Dr McCarthy that he had made the voyage to the pole 10 times in recent years and that he had never before encountered the open sea. </p> <p>The scientists' discovery appears to present some of the most tangible evidence possible that global warming is a real phenomenon. Over the past century, the surface temperature of the globe has risen by less than 1C, though the rate of increase has accelerated in the past 25 years. </p> <p>Strong evidence of the shrinking of the polar ice cap is not new. Scientists at Nasa's Goddard Space Science Institute, who have compared data from submarines taken in the 1950s with more recent findings, have shown that the ice cover over the entire Arctic area has shrunk by around 45%. </p> <p>Satellite images have confirmed that the extent of the ice cap has been reducing in recent years. Most scientists say this is at least partly the result of the release by industry of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. A declining number say that the phenomenon is purely cyclical. </p> <p>But in the light of the discovery at the North Pole, the scientists say that it will be hard for sceptics to go on claiming that the problem does not exist. </p> <p>\"Some folks who pooh-pooh global warming might wake up if shown that even the pole is beginning to melt at least sometimes,\" Dr McKenna said.</p>",
  "The article \"What should you do if a man is about rape you?\" (G2, August 17), suggests that advice given in the September issue of Cosmopolitan is inappropriate. But that advice was a legitimate follow up to American research, which suggests that fighting back against a sex attacker can improve chances of survival: we clearly state that every rape is different and whether they fight back or not, women should always use their instincts. Cosmopolitan regularly features articles on rape survival, aftermath and prevention, and we believe any advice we can provide is useful and appropriate. <p>Our article makes it clear that there are three lines of defence: scream and shout to attract attention; reason with your attacker; and, only as a last resort, attack back physically. Sue Lees implies that our article reinforces the common myth that most rapes are by strangers when we clearly state that around 90% of reported rapes are committed by someone known to their victim. </p> <p>Cosmopolitan is committed to providing readers with the most practical advice on all aspects of their lives. </p> <p><b>Lorraine Butler </b><br> Editor, Cosmopolitan </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 Wendy Savage (Letters, August 16) is right to point out that consent (a mental function) cannot be determined at post mortem. One victim in that world rape capital, South Africa, who survived life-threatening injuries, tells in her autobiographical account how, while held in terror at knife point, she realised that her vagina was lubricating just as it would when she was sexually aroused. She later concluded that her body was protecting her as best it could from the anticipated shock of violent penetration. Perhaps there would be greater justice for rape victims if this valid bodily response was more widely recognised. </p> <p><b> Amanda Parkyn</b><br> Penkridge, Staffs  <a href=\"mailto:amanda.parky@cwcom.net\"> amanda.parky@cwcom.net</a> </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 No doubt Wendy Savage is right in saying that a post-mortem cannot show whether or not consent to sex was given, but she is wrong to assert that \"the number of convictions [for rape] ... has not risen\". </p> <p>Official figures show that although the conviction rate has fallen from 24% of reported cases in 1985 to just under 10% in 1997, the actual number of men convicted during this period has risen from 450 to almost 600 - a rise of one-third.

Her remarks justifying the killing of alleged paedophiles are as unacceptable as anything from the News of the World. </p> <p>Her suggestion that women need to take a leaf out of Israel's book and create a homeland for women shows where her own brand of isolationist feminism will lead. She will be well aware that the creation of an Israeli state resulted in the slaughter of hundreds of innocent Palestinians (including women) and the removal of thousands more. Pedlars of such ideas should no more be allowed a platform because they claim to speak for women than should those Nazis who attack asylum seekers. </p> <p><b> Mark George</b><br> Sheffield </p>",
  "<p>Here is an amazing thing - a gladiolus in the garden after all these years. Not amazing just because of its intensity of colour - although that is astonishing enough, mauve with a haze of magenta fighting through, giving it a satiny iridescence - but that it should be there at all. Sarah apparently got a dozen among a mixed lot of bulbs for her birthday last February and popped them into the ground in the general rush to get bulbs in this spring (incidentally, we planted all our alliums as late as March and even some tulips, too, and all did well. I suspect that on heavy, wet soil there is something to be said for very late bulb planting). </p> <p>There have not been gladioli in any garden of mine for 25 years because I strongly associate them with my childhood. If I try to remember (and I have not done this for a long while), I walk down to the chickens, turn left at the walnut tree and on the right of the grass path leading to the chickens is a bed that always housed dahlias and gladioli. The grass edge is raised up like a causeway, wisps of cut grass in the dry earth gutter. This is my mother's area of concern, all grown in rows and the dahlias staked with square posts, the gladioli with bamboos, both overwintering in tied bundles in the potting shed. The hens fidget at the gate. </p> <p>If I turn and look now, dahlias nearest the chickens, gladioli in the first half, I see like a cine film that the colours are demented, washed out pigments that don't add up to anything you can piece together into any coherent whole. Pale yellows, lipstick pinks (heavy 1950s lipstick, crescent stains on the porcelain), oranges like ice lollies and the palest of blues. But no one thought to judge them as part of the garden. They were grown as a crop, only coming into aesthetic consideration once picked and put into a vase. Hence their position tucked away down by the chickens, on the edge of the kitchen garden. They were produce, not art. </p> <p>Then Dame Edna Everage started to include gladioli in her act. I remember sitting in the gods more than 20 years ago, watching her humiliate those in the stalls, showering the front rows with dozens of gladioli at the finale. I don't know why gladioli were chosen to be such an integral part of the image, but at the time I assumed it was because everyone would instantly recognise their inherently kitsch ugliness. </p> <p>I don't want to sound snotty about them, because my plan is to go through the catalogues and, if I have time, visit a show where there is a wide variety and choose the really good colours, such as 'Oscar' in the giant-flowered group, 'Black Lash', 'Arabian Night' and 'Black Beauty' or the lime-green 'Spring Green' (these have all been taken from Sarah Raven's The Bold &amp; Brilliant Garden , \u00a325, Francis Lincoln). I want colours that burn, albeit with a sullen glow. Nothing remotely pale or washed out. And here, I think, is where the Dame Edna connection makes sense, because a large, modern florist's pastel gladiolus look like nothing so much as an elderly man in drag, trapped in his mother's clothes. </p> <p>So, now I have these glads in the garden, I am about to chuck away a quarter of a century's prejudice and order more for next year. Apart from anything else, gladioli are so much part of this late-summer season - fresh faces in what can become a slightly jaded crowd. </p> <p>Actually not all gladioli belong to late summer. Earlier this summer, on my visits to Guernsey, I enjoyed Gladiolus byzantinus, with its slender form, magenta flowers and architectural, sword-shaped leaves. I'd never seen it before and found myself liking it before the anti-gladiolus knee could jerk. It prefers dry, rather poor soil, and I don't know if it would grow on our wet clay, although it thrives in the Channel Islands and I am sure would do well on southern chalk. I shall try it anyway. It is a hardy perennial that comes from the Mediterranean - unlike most gladioli which come from South Africa - so does not need lifting after flowering, which all the late-flowering ones do unless you are in an exceptionally mild area. </p> <p>John Tradescant recorded it during his forays on to the Algerian coast in 1620, reporting that 'the corn flag of Constantinople grew by the acre in Barbary'. Gladiolus byzantinus is planted in autumn along with the spring bulbs and flowers (in Guernsey at any rate) from May through to July. I like the sound of the creamy, green-tinged Gladiolus tristis, which will start flowering even earlier, in April, and is powerfully night-scented, although apparently the scent soon fades when the flowers are cut. The solution seems to be to grow it in a container which can be brought indoors while it is in flower. </p> <p> Gladiolus papilio (sometimes sold as Gladiolus purpureoauratus - just more tedious dazed-and-confused botanical nomenclature) is another hardy variety, although it does not fit the usual range of garish gladioli colours. Brian Mathew, in his authoritative book Bulbs - The Four Seasons (\u00a319.99, Pavilion) says that it is 'cultivated more as a curiosity than for show, although some like its muted colours'. </p> <p>This immediately set me looking for a picture, and the RHS encyclopedia has a shot of it looking distinguished and subtle, so of course I was converted. That is definitely on the list, too. It does come with a warning that it can be invasive, spreading by stolons, but perhaps it is best to think of it as a bulb that can be naturalised - as one might treat bluebells, snowdrops or narcissi. It apparently has glaucous leaves, and a comparatively short stem (24in) and, unlike byzantinus, flowers best in a rather damp, rich soil. That's us sorted and one in the eye for the hysterical gladioli school. </p> <p>Typically, the obsession with creating new and ever more garish forms of gladioli come from men. Gladioli became caught up in the hybridisation obsession that swept through the Victorian era and still inexplicably dominates much of the activity from nurseries and flower shows. Apparently, in the middle of the 19th century, James Kelway discovered Gladiolus psittacinus (now more likely to be sold under the name of Gladiolus dalenii ) and, to quote Miles Hadfield in his peerless History of British Gardening , (Penguin, out of print) 'saw within it possibilities of improvement'. By 1861 he was distributing the first of florists' gladioli. </p> <p>Unlike the species, Florists' gladioli need quite a lot of tending to get the best out of them. They have to be staked individually, dead-headed, weeded, watered and fed if the tower of flower is to be at its best. They are also prone to the gladiolus thrip - a tiny black insect that feeds off both foliage and flowers, rasping the leaves and leaving the surfaces a glistening pale grey. The leaves then turn brown and dry out. They also attack the developing flowers, so that the buds wither before they open. I have to admit that I have never noticed this, but then I wouldn't, having not observed a gladiolus without a dismissive sneer for quarter of a century. </p> <p><strong>Your roots</strong> Growing gladioli from corms and cormels</p> <p>Gladioli need a friable, well-dug site, with plenty of compost or manure. They grow from corms planted in May. Corms should be dug up after flowering, dried and stored in a cool, dark dry place. Gladioli grown on wet soil are prone to bacterial blight. The only way to deal with this is to pull up the plant and get rid of the corm. </p> <p>Gladioli don't flower for long, so start planting corms at the end of March and do repeat plantings every fortnight till the end of May. Plant 4-6in deep. </p> <p>They can be propagated from cormels - baby corms that grow off the parent and which come true to its variety. Let the corm and cormels dry out and, the following February, they can be teased off the corm. Plant cormels an inch deep and an inch apart in a seed tray. When shoots develop, pot up or plant in a cold frame. Give them a couple of years to flower, then treat them as other corms.</p>"
