  "<p>Take two nations, the Italians and the Brits. Which would you say is more inclined to save and finds it easier to control their spending - the flamboyant Mediterranean race or the more phlegmatic northerners? If you incline towards a prudent UK, you'd be wrong. </p> <p>At last month's 25th Annual Colloquium of the International Association for Research into Economic Psychology in Vienna, a paper from Paul Webley of the University of Exeter flagged up national differences in attitudes to financial planning. </p> <p>Italians were more inclined to save and found it easier to control their spending than the Brits surveyed. But across the sample, higher income led to more saving. And whether one felt flush or cash-strapped compared to one's reference group was also a way of predicting behaviour. </p> <p>The conference, held jointly with the Society for the Advancement in Behavioural Economics, also heard papers on such diverse subjects as children's savings behaviour and how women select perfume brands. </p> <p>Even our relationship with our clothes isn't as simple as it looks. Portuguese research on the the expression of self in clothing consumption found that clothes are an intimate part of our lives and a way of expressing ourselves - with the brands we choose playing an important part. </p> <p>Consumer expenditure has been rising by a greater margin than income since 1996, according to Mintel's annual British Lifestyles report. </p> <p>Research questioning 1,958 adults about spending plans found top spending priorities were having a good holiday (46 per cent), followed by buying a new car (38 per cent), decorating /making minor home improvements (38 per cent) and buying something for the home (37 per cent). </p> <p>In the past 10 years, gross income has increased by 22 per cent in real terms. The average personal taxable income is now more than \u00a330,000 per household - a 12 per cent increase from 1989. </p> <p>The amount of consumer credit outstanding is \u00a3600 billion, equivalent to more than \u00a310,000 for every adult in the country. </p> <p>Home acquisition and household services remain the largest element of the expenditure mix, at 30 per cent of spend in 1999. Travel and finance are the next largest expenditure areas, accounting for 17 per cent each. These two areas have shown the most growth over the past decade, with entertainment a close third. </p> <p>Some 53 per cent of adults - 59 per cent of men and 48 per cent of women - view owning a car as important to their lifestyle. Some 38 per cent would buy a new car as a priority given long-term financial confidence. </p> <p>Clothing expenditure has shown the greatest growth in the personal goods sector, increasing by 54 per cent in real terms between 1989 and 1999 to just under \u00a328bn. This is true of men as well as women. </p> <p>Expenditure on male toiletries has risen by 79 per cent in the past 10 years, as younger male consumers want to smell good as well as look good. </p> <p>Just under \u00a360bn is spent on pensions, equivalent to \u00a32,150 per employed person, or 9 per cent of average earnings. Four out of 10 adults regard both life insurance and personal pensions as important.</p> <p><strong>What kind of money manager are you? </strong></p> <p><strong>Sensible-but-sad </strong></p> <p>As a child you shopped around for savings accounts, rejecting fluffy toys in favour of top interest. You started a pension in your early twenties and school fees planning as soon as you stopped using contraception. You aim to retire at 50 and know exactly how you'll finance it.</p> <p>Congratulations, you're a model of prudence. But you've probably also had a predictable, unbroken employment record. Would you cope if circumstances changed? You may also be missing out on experience today for the sake of safety tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>Modern-day miser </strong></p> <p>You won't identify with the Dickension miser, but the tendencies are there in the way you search through best-buy tables and check your Visa statement to see what exchange rate you paid on that cheap wine in Calais. Your habits may protect you from want, but could also be a source of family conflict.</p> <p><strong>Defiantly ignorant </strong></p> <p>You take pride in taking as little interest as possible in money. Worrying about the future is a waste of time and keeping track of your bank balance is for neurotics. You run a balance on your credit cards and never pay them off even though you think banks are a rip-off and part of the global capitalist conspiracy. There is nothing damaging about this approach in itself, but you will come unstuck if your income dries up. Your inability to face up to financial issues may also be difficult for partners to cope with.</p> <p><strong>Chaotic but comfortable </strong></p> <p>You earn enough to afford most everyday needs, and holidays, but sometimes lurch into the red. You looked for a cheaper mortgage once, but never got any further. You know you should have a budget, but it would be too tedious to work out what you spend on takeaways. You've no idea whether you are putting enough into your pension.</p> <p>You're in good company: much of the British population operates this way. The risk is that you'd find it difficult to cope if circumstances changed, and you'll get a shock when, at 50, you find it is too late to save for retirement at 55. The good news is that if you spend a few hours looking at what you spend, why and where, you're close to a balanced attitude.</p> <p><strong>Compulsive </strong></p> <p>You habitually spend on things you don't need. You don't always wear the clothes you buy. 'Shopaholics' are often dismissed as fashion victims, but their habits can be a symptom of psychological distress. If your spending is getting you into debt, seek help. If you can cope financially, think seriously about why you behave this way.</p> <p><strong>Delusions of grandeur </strong></p> <p>You have wealthy friends, and hate not keeping up. You want your house pristine, and why not? You can borrow on the equity in your house. But you could be in the grip of a delusion that has felled at least one internet start-up and many a financial fraudster: you have access to money, but you can't afford to splash it around because it is not really yours.</p> <p><strong>Thrill-seeker </strong></p> <p>You are interested in money - but only in making it quickly without robbing a bank. The internet provides the means by which financial thrill-seekers can indulge themselves in the stock market. But you may not amass riches long term. For thrills, try white-water rafting.</p> <p><strong>Too cautious by half </strong></p> <p>The thrill-seeker's alter ego, you may be shocked to realise that pensions and endowments are stock market investments. You're a natural saver and have more in the bank or building society than you'd ever need in an emergency. You're just too nervous for anything adventurous. But if you're saving for large expenses - putting children through university or paying for retirement - you need a less cautious approach.</p> <p><strong>Keep it simple</strong></p> <p>People on low incomes are probably more likely to be good money managers than the well off, according to Paul Webley, professor of economic psychology at Exeter University. </p> <p>Many people don't manage their money very well, but they don't need to. For others, things are so finely balanced that letting the children go swimming will throw them out. 'If you spend whenever you want to but have a steadily rising income, it is not a problem. A rising level of affluence means people can afford to be lax.'</p> <p>For more affluent people, counting pennies may be unnecessary, but setting aside money for a pension is a priority. Webley says that even here you do not necessarily need a huge level of financial planning. Once the direct debit is set up, you won't notice it.</p> <p>Webley's definition of a healthy modern-day attitude to money is to have a long-term view. You should consider, for example, how you will finance children through university.</p> <p>Having a wide and diverse collection of investments and insurance products does not necessarily mean you are a good money manager. Most advisers are familiar with clients who have a rag-bag of investments, often of poor value,and have no idea why they bought them. Other clients may have invested over-confidently, buying and selling too often and spending too much on charges. And some people fall prey to the exhortations of insurance companies to protect against every conceivable risk - from theft of garden gnomes to unnecessary credit protection.</p> <p>Advisers say that investors who do well have generally chosen a few, simple products with reasonable charges and good long-term records, and made few changes to their portfolios.</p>",
  "<p> When the Spanish dictator Franco died 25 years ago, Juan Goytisolo felt liberated. \"I discovered that my real, tyrannical father was Franco,\" he says, \"my mother was killed by his bombs, my family destroyed, and he forced me to become an exile. Everything I created was a result of the civil war.\" </p> <p> Yet for the child of the 1936-39 Spanish civil war, whose books were banned under the victorious Franco regime, liberation came too late. He was living with a Frenchwoman and moving between Paris and his adopted land of Morocco. \"It would have been impossible to have a third life in Spain. I love Spanish culture but hate Spanish society; I can't live there.\" </p> <p> For 45 years, the expatriate Goytisolo has been both widely acknowledged as Spain's greatest living writer and its most scabrous critic. In some 30 books of fiction, autobiography, essays and journalism, he has turned the Spanish language against what he derides as \"Sunnyspain\", flaying the \"Hispanos\" while excavating their culture's Moorish and Jewish roots, suppressed over the centuries. He is passionate about Islamic culture (he speaks Maghrebi Arabic as well as Castilian, Catalan, French, English and Turkish) and castigates European insularity from a vantage point across the Gibraltar straits, siding with pariahs and heretics the world over who have been driven out and glory in a treasonous revenge. </p> <p> His friend, the Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes, likens Goytisolo to the Irishmen Swift and Joyce: \"exiles condemned to live with the language of their oppressions, digest it, expel it, trample on it, and then resign themselves . . . \" For another admirer, the Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, Goytisolo's books are \"unsettling, apocalyptic . . . a strange mixture of pitiless autobiography, the debunking of mythologies and conformist fetishes, passionate exploration of the periphery of the west - in particular the Arab world - and audacious linguistic experiment\". </p> <p> His translator Peter Bush, director of the University of East Anglia's centre for translation studies, believes no other Spanish writer matches his \"intellectual reach, constant invention of language and unusual absorption of other cultures - or stands on a par with the best of the Latin American writers, like M\u00e1rquez and Julio Cort\u00e1zar. Although he writes novels in an avant-garde, provocative, modernist style, there's always a political urgency behind them. His keen sense of history comes from his own life.\" </p> <p> Goytisolo lives in Marrakech, in a beautiful old house in the medina. Now aged 69, a small, rather frail figure, he is an habitue of the Caf\u00e9 de France on the main square of Djemaa el Fna, the pulsing heart of the Moroccan city. Though growing hard of hearing, he revels in its constant drum beats and human murmur which echo in his courtyard, shaded by orange trees. </p> <p> He is known as austere but has a surprising warmth and an impish humour, punning \"Rimbaud\" and \"Rambo\", or laughing at his own incompetence with gadgetry. Young children - the sons of brothers who have worked for him for almost 20 years, play delightedly with a tortoise at his feet. </p> <p> His new book, The Garden Of Secrets, is published next week in English. Hailed by Fuentes as \"one of the very finest novels in Spain of the last 10 years\", it returns to the civil war era that haunts much of Goytisolo's fiction. In 28 tales - one for each letter in the Arabic alphabet - it probes the fate of a fictional friend of Lorca, the great Spanish poet and homosexual, held by the fascists in a north African jail as \"a red, a queer and a poet\". The author's lifelong skewering of Catholic, nationalist Spain has been bound up with his bisexuality and an avowed quest for political, moral and sexual freedom. </p> <p> His masterpiece two-volume autobiography in the mid-1980s, Forbidden Territory and Realm Of Strife, broke ground in Spanish letters with its introspective sexual and emotional honesty. It traces his life up to the mid-1960s, when he ceased to be merely \"a writer of my generation\" producing conventional, neo-realist novels, and struck out on a path of risk and experimentation. </p> <p> The gay US writer Edmund White says: \"Goytisolo made sacrifices for both his literature and his politics. In a culture that now is evolved and permissive, but was then full of macho uptightness, his autobiography brought a note of total frankness. Homosexuality challenges the exploitation of women and role playing, the silences of personal life.\" </p> <p> Guillermo Cabrera Infante, the Cuban novelist, sees his friend as a \"picador: a frank and solitary writer on a crusade for truth. He's pugnaciously honest about his personal life, which is not easy in Spain. He doesn't kow-tow or buy the official line - Franco or post-Franco - and he doesn't belong to any Spanish coterie or club. He's an outsider - his own man.\" </p> <p> Perhaps for that reason, Goytisolo has won none of the country's big literary prizes, and has never been a member of its Royal Academy. He can still shock with a novel such as Carajicomedia (A Cock-eyed Comedy), now in its fifth edition since publication five months ago in Spain; it's a Swiftian satire on the Catholic church and its powerful secret society, Opus Dei. </p> <p> Through his journalism, too, he keeps up an abrasive dialogue with post-Franco Spain. In 1998 he was declared persona non grata by the mayor of the south-eastern boom town of El Ejido for denouncing the conditions of African migrant workers, and is proud to be an \"honorary Gypsy\" for his defence of another embattled community - \"still classified as immigrants after five-and-a-half centuries\". A collection of his roving reports for the Madrid newspaper El Pa\u00eds is due out in translation this autumn. </p> <p> Goytisolo was born in Barcelona in 1931, the third of four children, of \"exemplary bourgeois stock\". His Basque-descended father was an executive in a chemical company, and suffered from pleurisy. The family spent the civil war years in a mountain village in Catalonia, but when Juan was seven his Catalan mother, Julia Gay, was killed in a Francoist air raid during a visit to Barcelona. His father, who hated communists, remained loyal to Franco and was imprisoned by Republicans, the family \"caught in the crossfire of both sides\". </p> <p>After the war, Goytisolo was a \"mixture of orphan and street urchin\". His father forbade his late wife's parents from speaking to them in Catalan. Goytisolo, who writes in Castilian, the official language of Spain, says: \"I only learned Catalan in France in the 60s. But I was always on the periphery of Castilian; I have the freedom of someone not in the centre.\" </p> <p>There were literary antecedents on his mother's side, and his elder brother Jos\u00e9 Agust\u00edn, who died last year, became a poet; his younger brother Luis, a novelist. When Goytisolo was about eight, he was sexually molested - \"fondled, not raped\" - by his maternal grandfather. Yet more than the trauma, what emerges from his autobiography is compassion for the repressed homosexual grandfather who had been forced out of jobs and was mercilessly humiliated by Juan's virulently homophobic father, who made the penurious old man and his wife move out, though they all dined together every day. </p> <p> \"I'm against pederasty, obviously,\" says Goytisolo. \"I was a child and it was not agreeable to me; my grandfather wasn't responsible for my later sexual life. But in my 20s I assisted in his petty persecution, and it was very cruel. In the end, I felt pity for him.\" </p> <p> His grandmother became senile. \"My mother was killed; her sister and mother died in psychiatric asylums. Recently my brother discovered some beautiful poems my aunt wrote in her 20s. But my family never talked about her. Women were also the victims of this family.\" </p> <p> Goytisolo's belief that Catholic morality spawned his grandparents' \"secret tragedy\" spurred his drive to flee the \"castrating rather than sterile\" values of the Barcelona middle classes His agnosticism, Marxist leanings and sexual ambivalence put him at odds with his father, who was, however, spared the pain of his son's \"coming out\" by his death in 1964. \"I was contrary to all his expectations; he was very Catholic, a monarchist,\" Goytisolo says. \"But I saw a beggar here in Marrakech who had the face of my father when he died, and I was very moved.\" </p> <p> He was schooled by \"ignorant, small-minded Jesuit priests\", so calls himself an autodidact. He studied law in Madrid and Barcelona, and in 1954 published his first novel, The Young Assassins, to acclaim. Repelled by anything Spanish until he was in exile, he read European and American literature. But he soon fled a milieu where he felt alien and hamstrung by self-censorship. He moved to Paris in 1956 and, as a reader for the publishers Gallimard, became a conduit for writers of the Latin American \"boom\", including Fuentes, Cabrera Infante and Manuel Puig. </p> <p> His wife-to-be, Monique Lange, was a secretary for a translation agency who later became a novelist. Lange, who died in 1996, had a four-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, Carole (whose godfather was William Faulkner). The couple began a lifelong \"open\" relationship - each accepting the other's affairs - reminiscent of their friends Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. </p> <p> \"The first time I was in love was with Monique Lange,\" says Goytisolo. \"She was a fantastic woman, open, generous; she understood everything.\" Goytisolo who once described himself as a \"typical progressive intellectual and Communist party fellow-traveller\", wrote fiction influenced by Sartre's theory of social commitment, while filing bitterly anti-Franco reports for French newspapers. He threw himself behind the 1959 Cuban revolution, partly out of guilt at the discovery that his Basque great grandfather had made his fortune from slaves in Cuba. </p> <p> \"As a child I saw many photographs of his sugar plantation, but I was very shocked by the letters from his slaves. It was the beginning of the revolution, and I visited the village where many of the black and mulatto people had my family name. I even met a Juan Goytisolo.\" He last visited Cuba in 1967. \"I discovered the repression against African religions, censorship and persecution of homosexuals; I felt estranged from the revolution after that.\" </p> <p> Cabrera Infante, who met Goytisolo in Paris and travelled with him to Cuba, recalls him as \"very shy and serious - though later I discovered his extraordinary sense of humour and irony\". He tells how Goytisolo was asked to appear on Cuban TV - on condition that he made no mention of his friend, by then on Castro's hate list - but he talked endlessly about Cabrera Infante's novel Three Trapped Tigers. \"He kept his word ,but did what he wanted to do; he has a dispassionate sense of fairness.\" </p> <p> Goytisolo finally broke with the Spanish Communists after predicting that Franco's dictatorship would collapse not through their efforts but through the modernisation of Spain. \"By the mid-60s, 2m Spaniards were emigrating, and 15m tourists came with their customs and freedom: society was changing. I was right, but it was sacrilege. I found myself banished by Francoists in Spain and attacked by the Communist party in exile. I decided not to write about Spanish politics till after Franco's death.\" </p> <p> He knew many writers in Paris, from Camus (\"cold and distant\") to Hemingway, whom he met at a bullfight. But Jean Genet was his mentor - \"moral more than literary\". He says of the playwright who could fit all his belongings in a suitcase: \"He was alien to all kinds of vanity. Because of him, I discovered I was interested in literature, not in literary life. I try to take my work seriously but not myself.\" He quotes Genet: \"If you know your point of arrival, it's not a literary adventure, it's a bus journey.\" </p> <p> Genet may also have been a catalyst for his exploration of bisexuality. Edmund White, Genet's biographer, says: \"Genet was absolutely fearless. When they first met, Genet stared at Goytisolo and said, 'You're a fag, aren't you?'. He represented absolute freedom from middle-class morality and total integrity in art.\" Goytisolo, who loathed \"traditional female passivity\", had been drawn to the bars and brothels of the Barcelona slums of his early fiction, but hankered for dockers. \"My sexuality was never bourgeois or polite,\" he wrote. \"I was never attracted by well brought-up people wearing ties.\" He saw himself as a masked imposter and yearned for authenticity. </p> <p> \"In Barcelona my only sexual education was to go with [women] prostitutes and men of my class,\" he says. \"But it was not satisfactory. In Spain the model of men I find attractive didn't exist then. But in France I found friends in the Arab coffee houses of Barb\u00e8s, where I remember being the only European. I tried to learn Arabic.\" </p> <p> He found his type in the \"rough, sunburned sons\" of the Islamic belt, from Morocco to Pakistan. He and Lange were active supporters of the Algerian independence movement, the FLN, and protested against crackdowns on north Africans in Paris during the Algerian war of 1954-62. In White's view: \"like Genet and Pasolini, Goytisolo is a gay European drawn to the Third World through his erotic tastes but who ... developed that impulse both through political activism and artistic innovation ... [He] is an apostle of the revolutionary, anarchic power of sexuality, of the desiring body, to break through the sterile confines of class.\" </p> <p> In the Islamic world, Goytisolo maintains, \"homosexuality is very natural but it's a condition not to be named\", and is often signalled not by effeminacy but by exaggerated virility. \"I never go to bed with men of Christian origin,\" he adds. \"It's almost impossible, because they've come to an open homosexuality out of a long sickness. I was sick for years, and didn't want to meet people who were also sick.\" </p> <p> He prefers illiterate or less educated men. \"I had homosexual writer friends, but there's a need to be with someone completely different: social difference plays the same role in attraction for me as gender between men and women.\" On the dangers of exploitation, he says: \"There's always a commercial transaction; there's no love, but there's friendship. I love only Monique; I never fell in love with anyone else.\" </p> <p> Lange, who introduced Goytisolo to Genet and found his enigmatic sexuality alluring, is described by White as having been \"totally warm, charming and very French, but painfully shy and with a slightly beaten look\". Goytisolo's first fulfilling gay sex, with an Arab man in Barb\u00e8s, prompted an agonising four-year crisis. It was resolved in 1965 by a moving letter he wrote to Lange (included in his autobiography), in which he confessed to being \"totally, definitively, irrevocably homosexual\". Her response came in a telegram: \"An inhuman week. I still love you.\" </p> <p> From that time Goytisolo lived part of the year in Morocco, often without Lange, and their focus shifted, he wrote, from sex - though they still had a physical relationship - to \"shared values and feelings\". \"That letter to Monique was the most difficult act of my life,\" he recalls. \"I was afraid her reaction would be to cut our ties. But we kept together in a beautiful relationship. She knew there was no possible rivalry between the men I went with and her. I think she was sad, but she took a strong moral position: it was a kind of victory, to establish a new relationship against social prejudice. It was very difficult. But human beings are more complicated than they're supposed to be by society. We tried to live without lies. Most people I know live permanently in lies; many couples exist because they've both hidden many things.\" </p> <p> Lange's novel Les Poissons-chats tells of the heroine's difficult love for a homosexual, and Lange referred to her own husband as \"ever absent\". However, from his point of view, \"it was always with humour and generosity\". </p> <p> In 1978, Lange had a health scare, and they decided to get married. For Goytisolo, the dawn of sexual openness at 34 was a \"rebirth\". \"I felt a free man; suddenly free of ideology, religion, patriotism.\" He broke with realism in the autobiographical Marks Of Identity (1966), which he calls his \"first adult novel\". He disowns his previous eight books. From then, all his works were banned in Spain till Franco's death, but were published in Mexico or Argentina. </p> <p>They have been translated into French, English, German and, increasingly, Arabic; his following extends to Morocco, Syria, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon. Marks Of Identity, together with Count Julian (1970) and Juan The Landless (1975), formed a trilogy that shocked with its celebration of 700 years of Moorish Spain and hybrid culture. Count Julian was once described as a \"poison pen letter to Spanish society\", because it sent up the Catholic cult of virginity. It also attacks Spain's obsession with \"purity\", which includes denying the Arabic influence on the Spanish language. The book was conceived in Tangier and reveals the subconscious Spanish terror of the Moor. Goytisolo says: \"for centuries Spain was a frontier between the Christian and Islamic worlds; anti-Muslim sentiments are very profound. When I was a child, people would say, 'Be quiet, the Moro is coming',. I felt completely foreign to my country. I imagined the destruction of Spanish mythology, its Catholicism and nationalism, in a literary attack on traditional Spain. I identified myself with the great traitor who opened the door to Arab invasion. I discovered that the Franco dictatorship was the result of a long tradition that began in the middle ages.\" </p> <p> For Goytisolo, the first modern totalitarian state came with the Catholic monarchy's support for the Inquisition and the later expulsion of Spanish Muslims in 1609. Spain's destruction of its plural culture was the downfall of that state, bringing with it intellectual sterility and delayed modernity - its \"long holiday from history\". </p> <p> He says: \"The vitality of a culture is in its capacity to assimilate foreign influences. The culture that's defensive and closed condemns itself to decadence.\" Goytisolo in exile has re-read the Spanish classics he once spurned. \"I've spent almost all my adult life outside Spain. I compensate by trying to live inside Spanish culture. Everything I wrote after Count Julian was a dialogue with Spanish literature. I know many writers who want disciples, imitators. But I'm looking for ancestors.\" </p> <p> His eclectic family tree includes the Archpriest of Hita, a 12th-century \"Boccaccio or Chaucer\" who mixed Latin, Hebrew, Arabic and Castilian; the mystic St John of the Cross; the Sufi poets; and the picaresque novelists. For him, the Spanish canon has been \"brutally savaged\" by persistent taboos, such as refusing to admit that Cervantes might have been a \"new Christian\" - a Jewish convert during the Inquisition. \"If you don't take into account the Jewish origins of most writers of the 15th to 17th centuries, you don't understand the drama: it was the first confrontation of intellectuals against a totalitarian state. It's like teaching 20th-century Russian literature as a Golden Age, without mentioning the Gulag.\" </p> <p> Nor is the Arabic role acknowledged in the origins of the European novel - he cites Cervantes, who was held captive in Algiers, drawing on the Thousand and One Nights: \"Kundera was right to say the modern novel began with Cervantes. Don Quixote combined the western and Arabic traditions.\" </p> <p> Goytisolo calls The Garden Of Secrets a homage to Cervantes. He learned that many civil war poets were gay - Lorca and friends on the Republican side, and closet homosexuals among the Falangists, Franco's fascists, who \"wrote very bad poetry about the German army and the Aryan ideal\". Yet while Franco's side was virulently anti-semitic, its Moorish mercenaries from the Rif were attacked by the other side, the Republicans. </p> <p> \"They weren't able to distinguish between the Moroccan people and poor mercenaries who need to eat. I'm not nostalgic or idealistic; there was always conflict between Jews, Arabs and Christians in Andalucia. But the problem is, they said you can't be Spanish without being Catholic. Always, those who don't speak like you are 'foreigners' who need to be expelled.\" </p> <p> When Goytisolo much later returned to Almeria province in southern Spain, where the poverty had shocked him in the 1950s, he found an agricultural miracle fuelled by north African migrants. He likened their conditions to those of Cuban slaves, prompting him to predict today's renewed cries of \"Moors out!\". He despairs of post-Franco Spain - as newly rich, newly free and newly European. \"After the treatment of immigrants and Gypsies, I feel the same way about Spain as I did in Tangier. The problem is the incapacity to embrace the richness it contains.\" The same goes for \"Fortress Europe\". Seeing Turkish graffiti in Le Sentier, the Paris garment district where he lived with Lange, Goytisolo's impulse was to take up Turkish classes. </p> <p> \"When I was a child in the 40s, the Catalan language was forbidden. I realised that to have two languages and cultures is better than one; three better than two. You should always add, not subtract. I've tried to be a kind of European with a knowledge of other areas of the world.\" He revels in the polyphony, diversity, healthful promiscuity and \"reciprocal contagion\" of cityscapes, which he celebrated in his novels Makbara (1980) - a hymn to sex as freedom - and the darkly funny Landscapes After The Battle (1982). For him, an \"urban animal\", the \"Babelisation of great capitals\" is a sign of modernity. </p> <p> In The Virtues Of The Solitary Bird (1988), the terror of Aids merges with a wider fear of contamination - to \"not being of pure blood, pure Christian; being infected by a foreign or alien ideology\". He sees Spain's expulsions of Jews and Muslims as a precursor of today's ethnic cleansing, by the likes of Radovan Karadzic in Bosnia and Jean-Marie Le Pen in France. During the Bosnian war, he wrote of the targeting of Sarajevo's library by ultra-nationalist Serbs, who echoed the Spanish fascists of the 1940s, as \"memoricide: thousands of Ottoman, Persian, Arabic manuscripts were destroyed to kill memories and construct a new mythology\". </p> <p> In a lecture in Oxford, entitled \"We are all Bosnians\", he called for intervention. Where, he asked, were the Hemingways and Orwells to defend secular citizenship - \"the most important part of the French revolution? I was convinced that after the second world war and the Holocaust some things were impossible in Europe. But I discovered in Yugoslavia that my conviction was wrong; everything is possible.\" </p> <p> Since his wife's death four years ago, Goytisolo has lived in Marrakech. \"She died suddenly in her sleep. For her it was wonderful, there was no pain. But I wasn't prepared. It was very difficult for me to get used to living in Paris without her; I got depressed. My apartment became a kind of tomb.\" </p> <p> He has created an unorthodox household with his friends the Darouzi brothers (\"not a sexual relationship; it's family\"), and their sons, eight-year-old Rida, and his younger cousins, Younes and Khalid - who he has made his heirs. </p> <p> He also heads a Unesco drive to have Marrakech's Djemaa el Fna, where he learned his colloquial Arabic, designated as the world's first \"oral heritage\" site. Scornful of the \"educated but uncultured\" Moroccan bourgeoisie who look down on the low-life spinning fabulous tales on the square, he gleams with uncondescending pleasure at the paradox: \"The illiterate storytellers were my professors.\" </p> <p> The Garden Of Secrets is published on Thursday by Serpent's Tail, at \u00a314.99. Juan Goytisolo will be at the Edinburgh book festival on Saturday August 26 at 3.30pm.</p>",
  "<p>The RSC, who've paid my fare, believe I've come to America to play Macbeth at the International Festival of Arts and Ideas at New Haven, Connecticut, but I'm afraid my mind is focused on the holiday afterwards in Massachusetts - whale-watching. We've been doing Macbeth for nine months, in Stratford, London and Tokyo; this is the finish - a doddle.</p> <p>Ah. How wrong I will be. This play doesn't carry a health warning for nothing. A harbour city, New Haven has perversely cut itself off from the water with an ugly tangle of freeways, and presents a rather rough, industrial face. Yet it's also home to Yale University - enclaves of elegant Gothic buildings in spotless rose, cream and honey-coloured brick. The university boasts two art galleries. The Yale University Gallery owns Van Goghs, Picassos, Monets, you name 'em, and - my favourite - a basement full of ancient Mexican figures in flame-red terracotta. </p> <p>Across the road is the Yale Centre for British Art. As part of the Festival (other visitors include the Metropolitan Opera, the Royal Swedish Ballet and the Saigon Water Puppet Theatre), it's presenting an Art of Bloomsbury exhibition. Walking round, I happen upon a private tour - well-heeled New Englanders being shown round by a George Burns lookalike in polka-dot bow tie. One bejewelled old dame is so enraptured she marches up to a gallery attendant - \"Say, are these pictures for sale?\" The man gives a spluttering laugh - \"They're from the Tate!\" She doesn't bat an eye - \"Okay, so who do I talk to at the Tate?\"</p> <p>We're performing at the Long Wharf Theatre. One of America's most celebrated regional playhouses, its setting is bizarre. You drive into a sprawling car park. </p> <p>All around are refrigerator trucks, workers in gumboots and shower caps, signs like Lamberti Sausage Inc, Carl's Boned Chicken Inc, and here, among these meat-packing plants, the Long Wharf Theatre. As you gasp at the oddness, there's another surprise. A smell of blood hangs in the air. Especially ripe in the midsummer humidity. As the vegetarians in the company turn green (including our formidable Lady M, Harriet Walter), it occurs to me that this isn't bad preparation for an audience coming to Macbeth - a form of aroma-theatre, though I wouldn't want to do Merry Wives of Windsor here.</p> <p>We open to a rapturous reception. It's very exciting - the whales may yet find this a hard act to follow - till the first Saturday morning when I suddenly wake with no voice. I'm rushed to a specialist who says it's a throat infection that afflicts many visitors to the US, caused by the drastic temperature change from the outside heat to arctic air-conditioning indoors. </p> <p>Fortified with pills and sprays, I'm determined to do that night's performance. But when I open my mouth to say the first line, a rasping nothingness comes out. People onstage later describe it as sounding like The Exorcist, or when you try to shout for help in a nightmare. Which isn't far from the truth. We're forced to stop the show. An announcement is made, my understudy, John Killoran, takes over heroically, and I flee. This would be bad enough at an ordinary performance, but it turns out the top critic in the land is in - Ben Brantley, New York Times. I've just committed professional suicide.</p> <p>I hole up in my hotel room for the next two days. Throughout our run, we've all steadfastly denied The Curse of the Scottish Play. Do I have to admit to it now?</p> <p>No. Brantley shows surprising mercy - for a critic - and returns when I'm back on. He then writes the review that dreams are made of. Next, Greg Doran, our director (and my partner) arrives from England with news that Channel 4 want to film this Macbeth. Cursed? No, no.</p> <p>After the last performance, Greg and I head north to Rockport, Cape Ann, Massachusetts. Rockport is a rather cutesy little summer resort, its original fishermen's cottages converted into gift shops. It's a dry town, but you can bring your own liquor. We're staying at the Yankee Clipper Inn, a lovely group of silvery-grey clapboard houses on a great lawn that slopes down to the sea. Our room has a vast, sun-filled sea view. After nine months in the heart of darkness, this is perfect.</p> <p>Three miles away is the fishing port of Gloucester, a grittier, saltier place, everything rusty, peeling at the edges. The Whale Center of New England is based here. We've secured places on its small research vessel (you make a special application for these), but that's two days away - meanwhile, we take a trip with one of the big tourist whale-watching outfits, Captain Bill's.</p> <p>In fact, they're linked to the Whale Center, and its director Mason Weinrich happens to be the guide onboard today's crowded, two-decked catamaran. Having read about him in Mark Carwardine's On the Trail of the Whale (an excellent handbook to whale-watching round the world), I'd pictured him as a weathered old character, part scientist, part fisherman. Instead, he's more like someone from a Californian rock band: a tall, handsome figure with jet black hair, beard and shades, pacing round the deck with a cordless mike. </p> <p>It takes two hours to reach Stellwagen Bank, the underwater plateau whose rich feeding grounds attract large numbers of humpback, fin and minke whales. Suddenly an intensely black shape breaks the vast blueness of the scene. The ship changes course and picks up speed. \"Humpbacks . . . a mother and calf,\" Mason says into his mike. \"It's... yes... Scratch and Stout.\" </p> <p>Mason is doing three jobs at once: training an intern at his side, calling out directions to the ship's captain, and explaining whale behaviour to us, his mesmerised audience of tourists. Scratch is teaching Stout to kick-feed. This involves whacking the tail on the surface above a shoal of fish, and then diving open-mouthed into their stunned midst. On each dive you see a powerful arching of the spine (this put the \"hump\" in \"humpback\"), and then the tail lifts, showing the white markings underneath - the identifying feature of each whale - in a manner that is infinitely graceful and rather sexy. It's like a lady lowering a fan for a long, slow moment. Look, this is who I am. </p> <p>Now Stout swims towards the ship, dives under it and surfaces directly below our deck. Her long, white flippers show first, two turquoise wings in the dark water, then there's the gradual revelation of her enormous body - this is only a calf! - colossal yet weightless, slowly rising into view like a kind of dream. I glance at Greg. His eyes are full. So are mine.</p> <p>In between whale expeditions, we visit nearby Salem, site of the notorious witch trials of 1692. We're hoping for some penetrating insights into the supernatural, perhaps providing new material for our TV Macbeth, but the town is like a theme park with the Witch Dungeon Museum, the Crypt Caf\u00e9, Fatima's Psychic Studio and so on, every establishment fronted by people in amateurish period costumes. We flee.</p> <p>I'm both excited and apprehensive about our day on the whale research boat. The trip starts at 7am and lasts nine hours; you're advised to bring food, waterproof clothing and seasickness pills. Manning the small craft is another biologist from the Whale Center, David Morin, and another intern. There are also two other paying guests on board, Agnes and Wally, a Massachusetts couple in late middle-age, very hearty. He keeps laughing at everything, and I mean everything - but luckily the boat's engine is so noisy that everyone is forced into silence. </p> <p> It's a peculiarly beautiful day, overcast yet utterly calm: immense stretches of pearl-grey ocean, its texture like oil, like silk, like ice cream. Encountering our first humpback, the view is very different from the other day: down in this low, small vessel, we're right alongside the giant. It is bubble-feeding, which provides a riveting display. Diving below the prey - a shoal of little sand eels - the whale releases air from its lungs. You see a patch of water darken as the panicking eels crowd closer to the surface. A flock of seagulls gathers overheard. </p> <p>The water starts to dance - as though it's raining, yet from below - and a translucent glow develops as more air is released by the rising whale. The water's seething now - seething with excitement, like we are - the hovering gulls shriek with anticipation, and then, abruptly, like the shark in Jaws yet a hundred times bigger, the whale's black head bursts into view, pink mouth agape, white throat swelling. The seagulls go crazy, picking off eels still wriggling on the surface or escaping from the side of the whale's mouth. One bird lands on the gargantuan snout and balances there, wings half-open, ready for take-off at any moment.</p> <p>On our boat Agnes is in a state. \"Oh whaddaya do with whales?\" she cries; \"D'you watch 'em or d'you photograph 'em?\"</p> <p>We find a swimming mother and calf next, and steer alongside. So close you can see every rivulet of water running over the gently lunging backs, and the drizzle of misty breath returning to the surface after they blow. This is a strange, marvellous sound - rather like horses blowing their lips - and then you hear the mighty lungs filling with air again: a hollow, wet roar. Agnes lowers her camera, Wally stops talking and laughing; everyone just stands there watching the two leviathans. We journey with them for half an hour. It's very tranquil, very moving: their acceptance of us, their trust. Unfortunately, it's also what made them so easy to hunt.</p> <p>When we finally get back to Gloucester, Greg and I both have mild sunstroke, mild hypothermia, and keep lurching about on completely solid ground. Yet we can't stop grinning. What a day!</p> <p>Finally to New York. Could anything be more different? Well, actually it's not. This is holiday weekend, Fourth of July, and the city's great avenues are deserted, more majestic than ever, and - who would have ever used this word here? - peaceful. </p> <p>It's a terrific weekend. We lunch at the Tavern in the Park, we visit the Ellis Island museum in the renovated immigration buildings - storehouse of so many extraordinary tales - and we see two shows, both off Broadway. An all-black cast in August Wilson's early play Jitney, and the Tectonic Theatre Company in Moises Kaufman's The Laramie Project. The second - about the 1998 murder of a gay college student in Laramie, Wyoming - is one of the finest, most compassionate pieces of theatre I've seen in ages. And the ensemble acting in both shows is inspiring: American acting at its best, completely inhibited, never patronising.</p> <p>On our last day, news arrives from the RSC: our New York Times review has resulted in several offers to bring the show to Broadway. As we fly out of JFK, there's a sense we might be back sooner than we thought. The curse of Macbeth came close for a moment, yet now it seems more like a blessing again... but I mustn't say that out loud.</p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Virgin Atlantic (01293 747747) flies to Boston from \u00a3285 return.

  "<p>The Taj Mahal Challenge, I soon realised, is many challenges rolled into one. There's the challenge of raising the sponsorship, of doing the training, of coping with roughing it in a third-world country. But, most of all, there is the challenge of completing the course itself: 250 miles, from Jaipur to Agra, of heat, sweat, dust and aching limbs. </p> <p>Every day on the ride was much like another and each one started at 6am. We all paired up and slept in two-person tents that were erected for us each night and, in the morning, one of the crew would wake you with a cup of tea or coffee. He would also leave a bowl of warm water for a stand-up wash. The braver ones would walk over to one of the two loos, which were nothing more than freshly-dug holes in the ground surrounded by canvas awnings. Most of us preferred to wander off and find a shrub to hide behind.</p> <p>Breakfast consisted of fresh fruit, porridge, usually an omelette, and mountains of toast. The next important task was to fill our water bottles. Gallons of water were boiled for at least 20 minutes every evening and left to cool overnight, making it safe to drink. Huge drums went with us on the buses so that we could refill our water bottles whenever we wanted. By 8am, with packs loaded, water bottles filled, sunscreen smeared, limbs stretched and helmets fastened, we were off. </p> <p>The route took 28 of us across rural India. By midday, the temperature was nudging 80F. Most of the time we cycled along quiet country roads that were pot-holed and rutted, and which threaded their way through small villages. Mustard fields stretched to the horizon. We shared the roads with old men in dirty dhotis shepherding flocks of goats; carts going to and from market piled high with vegetables and heaved along by water buffaloes; and gaudily-painted public buses and delivery lorries decked out in tinsel that would announce themselves with a teeth-rattling blast of their horns and thunder by leaving inches to spare.</p> <p>By lunchtime, I always felt capable of tucking into my inner tube, so the sight of the chuckwagon parked up in a field, with delicious smells wafting from the pots on the gas braziers, and the clink of cold drinks being handed round, was a life-saver. </p> <p>The food was excellent: vegetarian dishes including dahl (lentil curry), bowls of differently-flavoured noodles, fried chicken and chicken curries, lamb dishes, rice, rotis and naan breads. </p> <p>Lunch or dinner, the story was always the same: we would stop in the middle of nowhere and, as if by magic, hundreds of villagers would appear. Men would drop their tools and leave the fields, passing goatherds would detour, women would abandon their washing and schoolrooms would empty at a rush. It was as if the circus had come to town. It took a day or two to get used to the idea of eating your meal with a couple of hundred sets of eyes staring at you from a distance of three feet. </p> <p>Cycling through the villages themselves was an experience not to be forgotten. </p> <p>The roads were never any more than narrow strips of rubble. But the typical street teemed with auto-rickshaws, camel carts, lorries and buses, all with people hanging off them. Everything happened in the street: food was cooked, tools were sharpened, chins shaved, motors fixed, goats butchered, children taught, deals done, clothes washed and bowels opened. Every village street was also a farmyard. Pigs ambled by, burying their snouts into piles of foul-smelling rubbish and cows wandered wherever they wanted, stopping occasionally to unleash a stream of bright yellow urine. It was bedlam and it was brilliant. </p> <p>What was already a seething hive of activity was spurred into even greater action by the arrival of 28 Brits on bikes. The effect was like dropping a bowling ball on a wasp's nest. Nobody stopped what they were doing but at the same time managed to shout a greeting or hold out a hand to be slapped in high-five fashion. People would clamber on to rooftops to get a better view of us, and naked children would bolt from their mothers' laps and almost run under our wheels to shout \"Allo\" or \"Ram Ram\" or \"Namaste\" in greeting. Then suddenly you would find yourself in open fields again. </p> <p>On most days we finished riding by early evening. The crew would have gone on ahead and pitched camp. Darkness fell quickly and by 7.30pm dinner was served. We ate in the open air under the light of hurricane lamps. Then, the crew would build a fire and we would sit around swapping stories. By 10pm, people would start drifting off to bed and the last ones would follow not much later. There's nothing like pedalling 50 miles a day for guaranteeing you a good night's sleep. Each night, I closed my eyes relieved that I had completed another day and content in the knowledge that we were going to do it all over again tomorrow. And there was always the Taj Mahal to look forward to.</p> <p>So what was it like? Like nothing else I had ever done. Was it physically demanding? Make no mistake, it was tough. For day two, my diary has a one-word entry: torture. What was the most amazing thing I saw? Incredible sights, too numerous to mention, jostle for position. Does the Taj Mahal live up to its reputation? Yes, and more. Is the poverty upsetting? Heartbreakingly so. Did I feel a sense of achievement? Definitely, not just for physically completing the challenge but knowing I had done something for someone else. What will I remember most? Life in the villages made the most vivid impressions on me, but the most memorable experience will be meeting up with a group of strangers who, within the space of only a few days, became like people I had known for years. Would I do it all over again? Like a shot.</p> <p><strong> Sponsored holidays</strong></p> <p><strong> How do you apply?</strong><br> I saw an ad in the paper and phoned the charity for a free pack that gave me the itinerary for the trip. We would fly to Delhi, be bussed down to Jaipur and then start the ride. Bikes would be supplied and we would be in the saddle for five days, averaging 50 miles a day, sleeping in tents, and finishing at the Taj Mahal.</p> <p><strong> What was the cause?</strong><br> Whizz-Kidz is a registered charity that helps disabled children, supplying mobility aids such as motorised wheelchairs and trikes.</p> <p><strong> What was the deal?</strong><br> You had to raise a minimum of \u00a32,500 through sponsorship. There was also a registration fee of \u00a3250 that was refundable if you raised more than \u00a33,500.

  "<p>I saw a sign the other day outside one of those Chinese-Japanese hybrids that are beginning to pop up around town, advertising 'Discount Sushi'. I can't imagine a better example of Things To Be Wary Of in the food department than bargain sushi. </p> <p> I never order fish on Monday, unless I'm eating at a four-star restaurant where I know they are buying their fish directly from the source. I know how old most seafood is on Monday - about four to five days old! </p> <p> I don't eat mussels in restaurants unless I know the chef, or have seen, with my own eyes, how they store and hold their mussels for service. I love mussels. But, in my experience, most cooks are less than scrupulous in their handling of them. It takes only a single bad mussel, one treacherous little guy hidden among an otherwise impeccable group ... If I'm hungry for mussels, I'll pick the good-looking ones out of your order. </p> <p>Brunch menus are an open invitation to the cost-conscious chef, a dumping ground for the odd bits left over from Friday and Saturday nights. How about hollandaise sauce? Not for me. Bacteria love hollandaise. And nobody I know has ever made hollandaise to order. And how long has that Canadian bacon been festering in the walk-in? Remember, brunch is only served once a week - on the weekends. Cooks hate brunch. Brunch is punishment block for the B-Team cooks, or where the farm team of recent dishwashers learn their chops. </p> <p> I won't eat in a restaurant with filthy bathrooms. This isn't a hard call. They let you see the bathrooms. If the restaurant can't be bothered to replace the puck in the urinal or keep the toilets and floors clean, then just imagine what their refrigeration and work spaces look like. </p> <p> Beef Parmentier? Shepherd's pie? Chilli special? Sounds like leftovers to me. How about swordfish? I like it fine. But my seafood purveyor, when he goes out to dinner, won't eat it. He's seen too many of those 3ft-long parasitic worms that riddle the fish's flesh. You see a few of these babies - and we all do - and you won't be tucking into swordfish anytime soon. </p> <p>'Saving for well-done' is a time-honoured tradition dating back to cuisine's earliest days. What happens when the chef finds a tough, slightly skanky end-cut of sirloin that's been pushed repeatedly to the back of the pile? He can throw it out, but that's a total loss. He can feed it to the family, which is the same as throwing it out. Or he can 'save for well-done': serve it to some rube who prefers his meat or fish incinerated into a flavourless, leathery hunk of carbon. </p> <p> Vegetarians, and their Hezbollah-like splinter-faction, the vegans, are a persistent irritant to any chef worth a damn. To me, life without veal stock, pork fat, sausage, organ meat, demi-glace or even stinky cheese is a life not worth living. Vegetarians are an affront to all I stand for, the pure enjoyment of food. Oh, I'll accommodate them, I'll rummage around for something to feed them. Fourteen dollars for a few slices of grilled eggplant (aubergine) and zucchini (courgette) suits my food cost fine. </p> <p><strong>Secrets of the chef's kitchen for a home cook</strong></p> <p>You need, for God's sake, a decent chef's knife. ONE good chef's knife, as large as is comfortable for your hand. Like a pro, you should use the tip of the knife for the small stuff, the area nearer the heel for the larger. </p> <p>The indispensable object in most chefs' shtick is the simple plastic squeeze bottle, essentially the same objects you see at hot-dog stands loaded with mustard. Mask a bottom of a plate with, say, an emulsified butter sauce, then run a couple of concentric rings of darker sauce - demi-glace, or roast pepper pur\u00e9e - around the plate. Now drag a toothpick through the rings or lines.</p> <p>Gaufrette wha'? That's French for waffle-cut. You can do that. All you need is a mandolin, a vertically held slicer with various blade settings. Dauphinois potatoes cut to identical thickness? No sweat. You didn't think they actually cut those with a knife, did you?</p> <p>Let me stress: heavyweight pans. A thin- bottomed saucepan is useless for anything.</p> <p>Ingredients that mark out restaurant food: </p> <p><strong> Shallots</strong><br> Essential for sauces, dressings, saut\u00e9s.</p> <p><strong> Butter</strong><br> In a professional kitchen, we saut\u00e9 in a mixture of butter and oil for that nice brown, caramelised colour, and we finish nearly every sauce with it (we call this monter au beurre); that's why my sauce tastes creamier and mellower than yours. Margarine? That's not food. I Can't Believe It's Not Butter? I can.</p> <p><strong> Roasted garlic</strong><br> Garlic is divine. Misuse of garlic is a crime. Old garlic, burnt garlic, garlic cut too long ago, garlic that has been smashed through one of those abominations, the garlic press, are all disgusting. Sliver it for pasta, like you saw in Goodfellas. Smash it with the flat of your knife blade. And try roasting garlic. It gets mellow and sweeter if you roast it whole, to be squeezed out later when it's soft and brown.</p> <p><strong> Chiffonaded parsley</strong><br> Restaurants garnish their food. Why shouldn't you? Dip the sprigs in cold water, shake off excess, allow to dry for a few minutes, and slice the stuff, as thinly as you can, with that sexy new chef's knife.</p> <p><strong> Stock</strong><br> The backbone of good cooking. Roast some bones, roast some vegetables, put them in a big pot with water and reduce, reduce, reduce. Make a lot, and freeze it in small containers.</p> <p><strong> Demi-glace</strong><br> Simply take your reduced meat stock, add some red wine, toss in some shallots and fresh thyme and a bayleaf and peppercorns, and slowly, slowly simmer it and reduce it again until it coats a spoon. Strain. Freeze this stuff in an ice-cube tray, pop out a cube or two as needed, and you can rule the world.</p> <p><strong>Fresh herbs</strong><br> A nice sprig of chervil on your chicken breast? A basil top decorating your pasta? A few artfully scattered chive sticks over your fish? A mint top nestled in a dollop of whipped cream, maybe rubbing up against a single raspberry? Come on! Get in the game!</p> <p>Good food is often simple food. Some of the best cuisine in the world - whole roasted fish, Tuscan-style, for instance - is a matter of three or four ingredients. Just make sure they're good ingredients, fresh ingredients, and then garnish them. </p> <p>Example: here's a dish I used to serve at a highly-regarded two-star joint in New York. I got 32 bucks an order for it and could barely keep enough in stock, people liked it so much.</p> <p>Take one fish - a red snapper, striped bass, or dorade - have your fish guy remove gills, guts and scales and wash in cold water. Rub inside and out with kosher salt and crushed black pepper. Jam a clove of garlic, a slice of lemon and a few sprigs of fresh herb - say, rosemary and thyme - into the cavity where the guts used to be. Place on a lightly oiled pan or foil and throw the fish into a very hot oven. Roast till crispy and cooked through. Drizzle a little basil oil over the plate - you know, the stuff you made with your blender and put in your new plastic squeeze bottle? - sprinkle with chiffonaded parsley, garnish with basil...

  "<p>The last time I bumped into Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Desmette, the idiosyncratic chef/patron of La Chouette, was nine years ago. I got out of a taxi by the green in Westlington in deepest rural Buckinghamshire. I saw him watching me out of one of the restaurant windows as I paid the driver and made my way to the front door. I was his only customer that lunchtime and, as he had seen me arrive, I couldn't very well pretend that I had just happened to drop by. So, after a brief skirmish, I owned up that I had come to review his restaurant. Well, I had to do something - he thought that I was a Michelin inspector. </p> <p>Nothing much seemed to have changed with La Chouette or Monsieur Desmette, I am pleased to say, when the wife of my bosom and I stopped off for lunch there the other day. Westlington still put me in mind of Sir Henry Newbolt's words about there being \"a deathly hush in the close\". Ours was the only car in the car park. The beetle-browed chef watched us out of a window of the very pretty brick-and-flint building as we marched across to the door, and welcomed us, the only customers for that lunch. I must have changed a bit since the last time we met, because he didn't exactly fall on me, instead treated us with his brisk line of charm and hospitality. </p> <p>M. Desmette is a true original. You'd have to be to have survived 10 years in Westlington. That was the reason we were there. I had passed on the official celebrations marking this achievement a week or so back, which involved dozens of regular customers, friends and two jazz bands. M. Desmette is something of an aficionado of jazz. In fact, it wouldn't be going too far to say that he was obsessed by it, just as he is by photographing birds, cooking, serving and drinking Belgian beers, and being tremendously forthright about his views on his neighbours, other chefs, food on TV, the iniquities of banks and much else beside, which he announces with considerable vigour in between bringing courses of food and wine or beer. The fact that he does both on all but his busiest nights is one of the reasons he has kept going when many around him have struck camp and crept away. </p> <p>The style of his cooking hasn't changed much, either, I was pleased to note from the menu. M. Desmette is Belgian, and he has no truck with dietary niceties and the modern taste for culinary mix'n'match, airy-fairy sauces and olive oil washing over everything. It has not been touched by kaffir lime leaves, balsamic vinegar, lemongrass, stir fry or any nonsense of that kind. His style is unabashedly old-fashioned and chunky-cut. It stands full square on both the plate and the palate, and is reminiscent of the kind of food you used to get in traditional restaurants de famille in France. </p> <p>My filet de barbue \u00e0 la Duvel was a typical Desmette dish. Duvel is a Belgian beer, and its particular light scent ran like a melody through the buttery richness of the sauce, which made a particularly opulent and classic accompaniment to a magnificent hunk of brill, all taut and muscular as fresh brill should be. </p> <p>The wife of my bosom's salade de blanc de volaille was a rather less classic affair, encompassing bits of warm chicken, endive fris\u00e9e, bits of plum and a quite-tart dressing made with very good red-wine vinegar. Strange as it may seem, it was delightfully refreshing, full of crunch in various keys. </p> <p>The salad was a useful contrast to her filet de saumon d'\u00c9cosse \u00e0 la blanche, which, although made with a different beer, was a close cousin to my first dish, with a sauce like liquid velvet wrapping a carefully-cooked brick of salmon. My cte de veau \u00e0 jus was just as majestic: a great slab of a chop covering two thirds of the plate, the rest of which was covered with an Andy Flintoff of a gravy and little bundles of vegetables arranged like points around a compass. </p> <p>These last represent my only reservation about the food at La Chouette: the vegetables hark back to plate accessories of 10, even 20 years ago. I would have thought it much easier, and much more satisfactory, to give larger helpings of two, or at most three, veg. But there you go - M. Desmette is his own man and has his own way of going about things. </p> <p>Sadly we did not have time - our fault - to explore the diaspora of the Desmette puddings. (I have very happy memories of a pear souffl\u00e9 from nine years ago. So happy, in fact, that I had two of them.) Still, we contented ourselves with a hefty bit of impeccable Roquefort washed down by the remains of a deliciously fresh, rounded Chinon 1996 from Charles Voguet, served correctly at cellar temperature. In fact, the wine list, with unusual length in wine from Alsace, the Rhne and the Loire, as well as a pretty fair weight from the classic areas of Bordeaux and Burgundy, is for serious drinking. The prices, although stiff by general standards, are not steep for wines of these vintages and this character. Anyway, there are plenty at the \u00a320 mark and below to keep distressed gentlefolk such as myself very happy. </p> <p>I was in a similar mood when signing the credit-card slip for \u00a385.38. It seemed a small contribution to the next decade of one of Britain's more individual outposts of gastronomy</p>",
  "<p>Making the year's principal bulb order also involves thinking about how, and where, the bulbs will be used - whether in pots for display, in bedding-out areas, as ingredients in mixed borders or naturalised in rough grass. </p> <p>To buy in bulk from a wholesaler is much cheaper than buying from retail outlets if the quantity you buy is of sufficiently high value. To this end, we pool our order with the requirements of our local horticultural society. This sells bulbs at its autumn show next month for competitive classes in the spring show. And it also grows bulbs in pots to sell as growing plants at its annual fund-raising plant sale in early May. </p> <p>The two firms we turn to most often are Parker's (452 Chester Road, Manchester M16 9HL) and Peter Nyssen (124 Flixton Road, Urmston, Manchester M41 5BG). Despite their addresses, both companies are Dutch. Parker's catalogue is lavishly illustrated and the prices quoted do not include VAT; Nyssen's is not illustrated and its prices include VAT. From both, I have to warn, customers might, under the varietal name ordered, receive the wrong goods, though generally of similar colouring. This, at least, has been our experience. I would urge customers to complain, so that more care might be taken by wholesalers to prevent it. Rogue varieties within the sample can be another irritation. </p> <p>On the whole, however, you'll get excellent value and, as the bulbs are sent straight from suitable storage for keeping them in good condition, their success rate is likely to be far higher than those bought them from a stall, where they are likely to have been submitted to fluctuating temperatures and desiccating draughts. </p> <p>When you receive your order, keep the bulbs cool and make sure you quickly plant those that shrivel easily and those benefiting from early root action long before shoots become apparent. Of the shrivellers, dog's-tooth violets, erythronium, are notable. The European E. dens-canis is a favourite of mine. It makes low clumps and has pinky-mauve, turks- cap-style flowers with chocolate-and-green-marbled foliage. </p> <p>That naturalises well in rough grass. The pale-yellow hybrid, 'Pagoda', is safer in a cool border or in open woodland conditions (how many readers have open woodland, I wonder?). That has hybrid vigour and carries plenty of pale-yellow turkscaps. Even better, I like E. tuolumnense (partly for the fun of getting my tongue around its name), which is bright yellow with shiny green foliage. All these are March-flowering. </p> <p>Blue-flowered bulbs are understandably in great demand, and they show up especially well in grass turf, where they contrast tellingly with natives such as red clover and field buttercups. The North American camassia, which is similar in growth to a bluebell but with stars instead of bells, is particularly good. Best of these, for richness of colour, is Camassia quamash (syn. C. esculenta): not only does this clump up, but it seeds itself, provided you wait until late July for the seeds to ripen and distribute themselves before cutting the grass. It flowers in May. </p> <p> Ipheion laxa (syn. Brodiaea laxa) does not flower until late June and early July, but needs to be planted the previous autumn. It has umbels of true blue funnels and looks very striking in a meadow, although, if you want to increase stock quickly and then transfer your gains to a meadow area, you should grow it under border conditions. </p> <p>Snakeshead fritillaries, Fritillaria meleagris, are native in wettish but not waterlogged meadows and they naturalise in turf well, in Scotland as successfully as in the south. You can buy them cheaply, but you may be disappointed in the results of your efforts the first year. Be patient: they take time to get going. These snakesheads spread by self-sowing. </p> <p>Certain alliums are splendid for giving body to a border in late spring and early summer, when other perennials are of comparatively flimsy texture. It is a good idea to scatter them among different species, so that they create a running theme. Allium hollandicum (syn. A. aflatunense) (1m) is mauve, while 'Purple Sensation' richer purple; both mix well, flowering in May. 'Globemaster' does so slightly later, and is mauve with has larger globes. </p> <p>Of the easy kinds, A. cristophii (0.7m) has the largest spheres. They start flowering in late May, being lilac mauve then, but keep their shape, while gradually bleaching, through the summer. It sows itself liberally, if you give it the chance, and I value it for pepping up my Japanese anemones when they are only half grown. A. giganteum (1.8m) looks splendid rising from behind other perennials, having globes of intense mauve flowers. It may need topping up from time to time. </p> <p>Eremurus (2m or 3m), the foxtail lilies, make a startling impression in May and June. They like a sunny position and good drainage, but it is best to site them in the middle of a border, where their dying foliage will remain unseen. One of the most vigorous is the well-named Eremurus robustus , which is a pale, flesh pink. E. bungei is late-flowering, rich yellow, and much more petite than most. There are some excellent hybrid strains, such as Ruiter Hybrids (Parker's), in compatible shades of pale pink, yellow, white and bronze. </p> <p>Eremurus have fleshy roots arranged like the limbs of a starfish and are notably brittle. The sooner they are planted, the better (ie, now), as root growth starts early.</p>",
  "<p>Matt Barrett is the big boss of the big bank for the big world. The chief executive of Barclays has a big pay packet to boot. In fact, everything about the 55-year-old Irish-born Canadian is big: his voice, his personality and even his moustache. </p> <p>Yesterday, he made his bank, which really was never quite as big as its crass advertising campaign made out, a fair deal bigger. In his first major strategic step since taking the helm of Barclays last October, Barrett confirmed yesterday that he had reached agreement to take over Woolwich, the former building society, with an aim to becoming a big player in the mortgage market and an even bigger one in cyberspace.</p> <p>In his big office, where a cigarette is smouldering on a big ashtray, smooth-talking Barrett is having trouble remembering when he last went to sleep. The nature of the City when big deals are being done, especially one that leaked as his did, means that time is precious and the demands of lawyers and investment bankers ensure that chief executives get little time to themselves when the delicate final details are being put together.</p> <p>Barrett, unknown in Britain until recently, is in good humour although flagging just a little. Already, he has talked to City analysts, held a press conference, given radio and telephone interviews and been photographed more times than he can remember. Pulling at his cheeks, aching from so much smiling at the camera, talking suddenly seems the preferred option.</p> <p>Since arriving in Britain in October from Canada, where he lived for the best part of 30 years, to take the helm he acknowledges that Barclays has had a few \"bumps\". From cash machine charges, branch closures and the potential size of Barrett\u00d5s pay deal, the bank seemed unable to get anything right in the public\u00d5s eyes. The situation was made worse by the \"big\" advertising campaign, which Barrett describes as \"an unfortunate confluence of events\".</p> <p>The advertising campaigns, featuring films stars such as Sir Anthony Hopkins, were not intended to portray Barclays as bragging about its size, says Barrett. Taken on their own, away from the controversy that was simmering away, they were supposed to show that \"big is also friendly\".</p> <p>With uncharacteristic understatement, Barrett acknowledges \"perhaps it wasn\u00d5t the greatest positioning\" as they reinforce the bank\u00d5s apparent insensitivity. Branches were being closed in rural communities where the bank was often the last one left on the high street, wreaths were hung above some branches and the negative publicity machine raged out of control.</p> <p>The ad\u00d5s message, though, was that as a big bank, Barclays had an array of talent, \"a richness\" to do things for its customers that smaller banks might not be able to.</p> <p>Tanned and immaculately dressed, Barrett\u00d5s good-natured banter is tempered slightly when discussing the image Barclays has battled with during his 10 months in charge. Perhaps, his critics have said, he should have taken a tougher stance with his managers earlier than he did to try to nip the disasters in the bud sooner.</p> <p>\"The train was still going through the station,\" he says, as he tries to explain that he could not just storm into Barclays and demand changes from the moment he arrived. Barclays has lost two chief executives in the space of a year, one of whom lasted only a day in job.</p> <p>Second choice as chief executive, Barrett had to get know the bank and put it in the context of Europe\u00d5s financial services, and not the north American market with which he was more familiar. \"Part of the leadership challenge is giving direction and change. I\u00d5d like to have gotten all that in place earlier... but no regrets,\" he says.</p> <p>He was only appointed chief executive after Michael O\u00d5Neill, a former American marine, resigned after one day in the job on health grounds. The bank had seemed to take a long time to find Mr O\u00d5Neill as the replacement for ex-Etonian Martin Taylor who walked out after a board room rift.</p> <p>In all, Barclays was run by its chairman Sir Peter Middleton, who added the chief executive title to his role, for almost a year before Barrett arrived. The City was anxious for action from a bank that appeared to be in danger of losing ground at a time when NatWest, its closest rival on the high street, was being assaulted by two Scottish banks half its size. The outcome of the battle propelled Royal Bank of Scotland above Barclays in terms of its stock market size and, without the Woolwich deal, left Barclays in real risk of being relegated to fourth place between HSBC, the Royal Bank and Lloyds TSB.</p> <p>While Barrett was Barclays\u00d5 second attempt at finding a chief executive, many City sources believe that Woolwich was Barrett\u00d5s second choice too. He is enigmatic when asked whether he had really tried to persuade Ian Harley, the dour Scottish chief executive of Abbey National, to sell out to Barclays just a few weeks ago.</p> <p>\"Woolwich is head and shoulders above its peer group in the UK,\" he says. \"One studied the competition. From our point of view they were the number one. We felt great we got together.\"</p> <p>The Woolwich deal is the beginning of a new chapter for Barclays. The poor publicity, the insensitive branch closures and cash machine charges are all in the past. The Woolwich deal is \"about the future\". There is a new injection of management \"folk\" from the Woolwich, including John Stewart, its chief executive who is to become deputy chief executive of Barclays, a new \"radical\" strategy approved by the Barclays board.</p> <p>\"Customer friendly\" is the bank\u00d5s new mantra, he insists. \"It sounds trite but it\u00d5s really a good ethos,\" he says. \"The most important piece of real estate in the organisation is the three feet between front line personnel and the customers. You succeed or fail on the service to the customer.\" He admits to \"agonising\" over why it is \"no one loves bankers\". \"It\u00d5s because there\u00d5s nothing inherently pleasing about going to a bank,\" he adds. It might also be because bankers rarely do little to help themselves. At times Barrett himself has sounded insensitive, telling a panel of MPs he was \"a bargain\" and side-stepping their questions in a manner to which they were not quite accustomed. Even the City has had difficulty deciding how to read Barrett and deciding whether the man, who shares few characteristics with any of his predecessors at Barclays, can really \"walk the talk\" as he had promised.</p> <p>Although he sounds north American \u00d1 his speech is littered with \"gottens\" \u00d1 Barrett is Irish by birth, born just towards the end of the second world war in County Kerry. It was not a charmed life: \"I am not to the manor born,\" he explains. His only source of education was the Christian Brothers School in Kells. He then escaped to London to join the Bank of Montreal as a cashier. Within just five years, his talents had been spotted and he was transferred to the bank\u00d5s headquarters in Montreal as a management trainee.</p> <p>He began his way up the career ladder with no real intention of crossing the Atlantic again. By the age of 45, he was chairman of Bank of Montreal, and one of the few bankers to achieve such an influential position at such a young age. At Bank of Montreal, he was behind the creation of an internet bank in the US. The experience of Barclays\u00d5 own internet bank running into problems recently cannot have been pleasant. The acquisition of Woolwich, credited for its expertise in new distribution channels such as the internet and mobile phones, is expected to give Barclays a fresh approach to the internet.</p> <p>The deal has also allowed Barrett to succeed where he failed in Canada, provided no rival bidders step in or competition commissioners become interested. His dream to merge his Bank of Montreal with its close rival Royal Bank of Canada was blocked on competition grounds. He retired shortly afterwards and has tried to play down the connection between the two events.</p> <p>Along with his accent, his management style is north American too. He talks about \"human capital\" and staff morale. And despite his apparently different style to the Woolwich\u00d5s no-nonsense John Stewart, he insists there is a real bonding. With the Woolwich team on board, he has a management team which is \"best in breed\" and which would \"stack up\" against the management of any of the banks he has encountered during his career.</p> <p>\"I wouldn\u00d5t trade any of them. It does not mean any of us are perfect, God knows, including myself,\" he says. While his eyes still betray his Irish blood, he made Canada his home and became part of the establishment. He was even awarded the Officer of the Order of Canada, the country\u00d5s highest civilian order. He became a well known public figure, not just for his business prowess but for his private life. This might have helped harden him for the British media.</p> <p>The first taster that he was from a different mould to many of the other chief executives in British bank\u00d5s boardrooms, came after his appointment as chief executive last year. The tabloids had even more fun with semi-nude pictures of his estranged second wife Anne-Marie Sten posted on the internet than the enormous size of his remuneration package. His total deal was estimated to be in the region of \u00a36m, a figure dwarfed by headlines generated earlier this year at a potential performance-related bonus which might net him \u00a330m, provided the share price soars.</p> <p>Of the media, he says: \"It goes with the turf. You accept what goes with the turf.\" He does admit, however, to being frustrated by criticism from people who have never met him.</p> <p>Barrett does not need to work. He was on his way to retirement when Barclays lured him, insists money has never been his motivater, even when he started out as a bank clerk. \"I was interested in survival,\" he says. \"I didn\u00d5t know much about share options. I was just trying to pay my rent in a northern part of London.\"</p> <p>Being motivated by money can often be a sign of being \"doomed to failure\". The most important thing, according to him, is to find something that is enjoyable. \"The rest will take care of itself,\" he says.</p> <p>Barrett admits that he had always fancied a Bohemian lifestyle. He had initially thought that journalism would allow him to achieve this aim. Deciding he was not a good enough writer to win the Pulitzer prize, he chose banking. \"The antithesis\", he smiles, recalling his friends\u00d5 startled reactions during a period when 1960s were in full swing.</p> <p>But, he has fun as a banker. \"It\u00d5s really a people business. You deal with money and people\u00d5s money. You see people at times of great triumph and great crisis,\" he says.</p> <p>The Bohemian streak, however, is only temporarily repressed. Just as he was being persuaded to take the role at Barclays, Barrett was looking for a new home in Mexico where, again, he was going to give writing another try. \"Banking seems to be my destiny,\" he says.</p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong>Matthew Barrett </strong></p> <p><strong>Born:</strong> September 20, 1944 in Country Kerry, Ireland</p> <p><strong>Educated:</strong> Christian Brothers School, Kells, Ireland;<br>Harvard Business School advanced management<br>progamme (1981).</p> <p><strong>Career:</strong> Bank of Montreal (1962-1999), various<br>positions beginning in London and culminating in his<br>appointment as chairman of the board in 1990.</p> <p><strong>Outside work:</strong> Two times married, once divorced and<br>legally separated from his second wife.

  "Uri Gordon, who has died aged 65, was Israel's leading immigration planner of the 1980s and 1990s. Tireless and inspirational, he settled hundreds of thousands of newcomers in a strange land, and argued that Israel's Law of Return for Jews was sacrosanct; no genuine applicant should be refused merely because he was unskilled. <p>Yet, ultimately, Gordon preferred genuinely motivated aliyah (immigration) to sheer weight of numbers. An early advocate of the mass migration of Soviet Jews, he later warned of \"national suicide\" if Israel continued to accept immigrants with no Jewish links. </p> <p>Gordon's upbringing exemplified the spirit that he wished to impart to more blas\u00e9 Israelis. He was born in Palestine, to Polish and Russian parents. Despite suffering from infantile paralysis, he became a youth leader in the working-class districts of Tel Aviv and learned the virtues of collective farming at Kibbutz Mishmar David, outside Jerusalem. </p> <p>By the late 1960s, he had founded the governing Labour party's Young Guard. In the early 1970s, he created clubs for young mizrakhim (Oriental Jews) in deprived development towns. The Zionist Federation then asked him to lead their new dor hemshekh (next generation) unit in 1974. </p> <p>Four years later in the United States, he set up Telem, a group that arranged courses and trips to Israel, and forums where American Jews could meet Israelis. Back home in 1981, he headed the government's youth immigration programme. Six years later, he became head of the Jewish Agency's immigration and absorption department. </p> <p>Immigration to Israel had fallen since the heyday of the early 1950s, but everything changed with Operation Solomon in 1991, when, in just 36 hours, 14,200 Ethiopian Jews were air-lifted from war-racked Addis Ababa. Suddenly, Gordon was responsible for feeding, housing and training people with no knowledge of westernised societies. Shrinking funds exacerbated his task. </p> <p>The Ethiopian influx to Israel was soon dwarfed by Soviet immigration, which accelerated with the crumbling of the eastern bloc in 1989, as more than 650,000 former Soviet citizens entered Israel in just six years. </p> <p>While Zionist orthodoxy deemed this a major triumph, several groups inside Israel were troubled. Mizrakhim resented the newcomers getting preferential treatment, just as they were poised to claim their own place in society. Older Israelis were amazed at some of the immigrants' ignorance and lack of patriotism. Palestinians were furious that even non-Jews were welcomed - a privilege they were denied, despite their historical links to the land. Many gentiles entered Israel legally as spouses of Jews, while others forged conversion documents. </p> <p>Gordon changed his opinion. By 1998, he was condemning laws that effectively forced Israel \"to open its gates and take in generation upon generation of non-Jews, a phenomenon that [will damage] the fabric of our future society.\" </p> <p>He certainly never shied away from controversy. In 1993, he asked Britain to refuse asylum to 100 Bosnian Jews, claiming that \"these Jews are not refugees; they have a home in Israel\". He favoured a Palestinian state, yet in 1996 appeared to endorse placing immigrants on West Bank settlements. </p> <p>In 1997, Gordon was elected president of Israel's Zionist Council. Undaunted by a recent stroke, he campaigned against the country's deepening schisms, trying to revive enthusiasm for the state's founding beliefs. </p> <p>Gordon was a tireless and inspirational man of action. He also raised profound questions about the land he loved. He is survived by his wife and three daughters </p> <p>\u0095 Uri Gordon, campaigner, civil servant and educationalist, born 1935; died July 30 2000</p>",
  "<p>Crisps may be one of the most popular types of snack but they hardly make the best use of resources. Four tonnes of potatoes are needed to make just one tonne of crisps. But then crisps did not start out as a carefully created snack. They are reported to be the result of a chef's rebellion. </p> <p>A diner at a Saratoga hotel in 1853 kept sending back his chips to the kitchen complaining that they were not thin enough. Eventually the chef had had enough. </p> <p>He cut wafer-thin slices of potato, cooked them in oil until crisp, and sent them out to his fussy customer to teach him a lesson. But the joke backfired because the diners loved them. </p> <p>Crisps first came to Britain from France in the early part of the 20th century. They caught the eye of William Alexander, an Edinburgh baker, who found he had time on his hands after the early morning baking shift. </p> <p>In 1947 he started to make his own crisps, which he named Golden Wonder, after the variety of potato from which they were made. At the time there were more than 800 small companies already making crisps. </p> <p>The Golden Wonder company, formed in 1957, was to notch up a number of notable firsts. In 1961 it moved production south of the border when it built the world's largest crisp factory at Corby. </p> <p>A year earlier it had been the first company to introduce ready salted crisps in Britain. Before that, little sachets of salt had to be fished out of the crisp packet before their contents could be sprinkled on the crisps. </p> <p>The company also introduced flavoured crisps to the British public in 1962. The first, cheese and onion, is still the most popular, despite an attempt to introduce crisps tasting of that perennial children's and students' favourite, baked beans. </p> <p>More recent flavours have included chicken tikka masala and flame-grilled cheeseburger. </p> <p>Golden Wonder also introduced the Pot Noodle. It took the concept from a Japanese product, but made considerable changes to the recipe and presentation. </p> <p>Pot noodles, which are almost a staple of the university student's diet, were first launched in Lancashire in 1977. The Golden Wonder product held off competition from products developed by rival snack food groups to gain 97% of the market. </p> <p>The profitable Pot Noodle business was sold to CPC, the US food conglomerate which owned the Knorr, Hellman's and Marmite brands and which is now known as Bestfoods. Pot Noodles' teenage appeal was underlined when British sales jumped in 1999 after Noel Gallagher of pop group Oasis was spotted eating one. </p> <p>Golden Wonder and its fellow crisp makers nearly lost their potato stocks in 1976. Potato growers had been hit by a disastrous drought. There were shortages and prices in the shops were soaring. </p> <p>During a House of Commons debate, it was suggested that the crisp firms should sell their potato stocks to shops to ease the crisis and bring down prices. </p> <p>Golden Wonder became a leading player in the British snack foods market with the introduction of Wotsits in 1970, Ringos in 1972, and the acquisition of Nik Naks and Wheat Crunchies in 1990. </p> <p>It lost its crisp market leadership in Britain after a fire destroyed its Corby factory in 1988. It took six months for the factory to get back to full production. </p> <p>Walkers Crisps, which had been growing rapidly as a result of heavy investment by its new American parent, the PepsiCo drinks group, took the top spot. </p> <p>Crisps account for about 60% of the British snacks market, with about 6.6bn packets being sold every year. About half a million tonnes of potatoes - enough to fill Wembley Stadium - are required to feed this voracious appetite. </p> <p>The Golden Wonder company was acquired by the Imperial Tobacco conglomerate in 1961 and was later sold to Dalgety. In 1995 it was taken over in a \u00a368m management buy-in backed by Legal &amp; General Ventures. </p> <p>The management and its venture capital backers have just made a handsome profit by selling the company to Bridgepoint Capital, a private equity firm. </p> <p>Bridgepoint, which was bought out from NatWest earlier this year, is thought to have seen off competition from PepsiCo and fellow private equity group Phildrew Ventures. </p> <p>Golden Wonder has a fleet of lorries supplying wholesalers and retailers, and its services division is the largest national van supplier of crisps, snacks, nuts and other savoury products to pubs, schools and leisure venues. </p> <p>Because packets of crisps are light and bulky, the vehicles, in effect, are transporting a little potato and lots of air. The crisp, from first to last, maintains its reputation for wasting resources. </p> <p>Perhaps the last laugh is with the Saratoga chef. </p> <p><strong>The Fax</strong></p> <p>It takes about 15 minutes to turn a muddy potato into Golden Wonder crisps. </p> <p>Golden Wonder crisps are available in more than 50,000 shops throughout Britain. . About 4m packets of Golden Wonder crisps or snacks are sold every day.</p>",
  "Brilliant morning sunshine lit our path as we began the traverse from Schwandfeldspitz towards the Furggi pass. Great billows of silver vapour blew off the knife-edge ridge of Gsur as we turned off across its south face below long tongues of old snow-ice filling its fierce gullies. A chamois trotted down a flowery slope. <p>In an hour and a half we came off the steep face to wander across the meadow at Furggi, where the bells of the dairy herd rang a gentle refrain - as they have done these past five centuries and more. We were in our alpine fairyland 2,500ft above the valley floor and sheltered here by the surrounding summits. </p> <p>Now began the slog up to the Furggi pass where a tremendous view appeared, out to the north across shattered, peaky ridges that hid a dozen green valleys. The razor ridge rose from our pass, tower beyond tower to the top of the Gsur, but our route lay in the opposite direction, straight up over the pinnacles of Hempliger in the sunlight to the ultimate top of the Albristhorn. </p> <p>How these upland backwaters contrast with the tourist hotspots in the main valleys - silent and almost entirely undiscovered. Here are the chalets where the valley farmers still come for three months each summer to let their herds convert the multi-coloured alps to richest milk and tasty cheeses. It's an an cient husbandry still practised efficiently far from the general gaze but not encountered these days in the high grasslands above the popular resorts like Zermatt and Saas Fee. </p> <p>The long descent to the green pass of Hohnenmoos involved the traverse of Seerolhore and the Laveygrat, where recent erosion is fast reducing the shattered pinnacles to shadows of their former proud profiles. We were down in less than two hours, but now grey-blue clouds were piling in from the south-west. By the time we'd reached the shelter of the conifers above Adelboden it was raining steadily, but it was perfectly dry as we trod the brown needle carpet and heard the swifts hunting the evening midges.</p>",
  "For more than a decade it has been a dirty word at the Edinburgh Festival, the one thing that guaranteed box office death. But now politics is back with a vengeance on the Fringe and is putting bums on seats as never before. <p>From Steven Berkoff's Messiah, which depicts Jesus Christ as a revolutionary leader done down by a strikingly Peter Mandelson-like Pilate, and various plays about asylum seekers, led by the acclaimed Bogus Woman, to Peter Searles' blackly comic portrait of Pinochet's birthday in Hey Gringo, politics is all-pervasive. </p> <p>\"You can hardly move on the Fringe for gender politics,\" said Joyce McMillan, the author and critic. \"There's Kate Atkinson's play about sperm banks, Abandonment; Liz Lochhead's Medea; Abi Morgan's Splendour, Achilles and quite a few others too. There hasn't been such a strong political crop in years.\" </p> <p>There are even stirrings in the once cynical world of stand-up. Comedian Rob Newman is about to combine his new show, Resistance is Fertile, with a series of lunchtime political lectures advocating direct action. Scott Capurro, an American comedian, has sparked a heated row with a joke about the Holocaust, and another American, Rich Hall, the hot favourite for the Perrier Award, has been lacing his show with pops at the US penal system and the neo-Darwinism that's creeping into politics everywhere. \"I don't believe in the criminal gene,\" he said, \"but if there was one, I think they'd find it right next to the out of work one.\" </p> <p>Even where you drink this year has become a political statement. Lee Hurst has refused to go into the Assembly Rooms bar, the traditional after show haunt of the comics, because it is sponsored by Rupert Murdoch's Sky TV. </p> <p>The \"green comedy\" duo Ciderdelic, who took part in the riot in Parliament square on May Day, have been leading their audience out on to the streets after their show every night to block the traffic, and yesterday they caused disruption on Princes street, Edinburgh's main thoroughfare, by staging a reclaim-the-streets demonstration, attempting to lay a lawn outside McDonald's. </p> <p>Tomorrow, Sir John Drummond, the former controller of Radio 3, is expected to use the launch of his book, A Life in the Arts, at the Edinburgh International Book Festival to lay into government cultural policy. </p> <p>Nor are politics on the Fringe stages the preserve of the left. Up to 30 people a night have been walking out on the rightwing Australian stand-up Brendon Burns, the self-styled \"scourge of the politically correct\". </p> <p>Only in the increasingly creaky International Festival, which starts tomorrow, is politics taking a back seat. Brian McMaster, the director, cut its long-running lecture strand after a speech by the Scottish composer James McMillan last year, claiming that the country was still rife with sectarianism. </p> <p>David Woods, one half of Ridiculusmus , who have had rave reviews for their hard-hitting absurdist play, Say Nothing, about how little the peace process has changed Northern Ireland, said disil lusionment with New Labour had sparked revival in more political material. </p> <p>\"Like the peace process, Blair came in promising much but very little has been delivered. People had been biting their lips for years before that, and they have felt let down. Artists are always an early barometer of what the people are really thinking. They have begun to question where we are going, and that's why politically-inspired work has been re-emerging. It's only natural, really.\" </p> <p>Rob Newman said the reason is more deep-seated. He feels the public have grown jaded of the \"culture of irony\" that trivialises and dismisses everything as joke fodder. \"Satire has no fire in its belly and believes in nothing. But everywhere people are angry, betrayed, working longer hours just to pay their bills and hoping they will never get ill or old or have kids who want to go to university,\" he said. \"Political stand-ups now get the kind of response in places like Barnstaple, Gravesend and Maidstone that five years ago you used to get only in Liverpool, Glasgow, Manchester or Sheffield.\"</p>",
  "You can taste the mood among the spice stalls of the Bakara Market and hear it over the hum of the air-conditioning in the businessman's office. You can feel it in the cellblock of the Islamic court and you can smell it in the stench of the refugee camps. <p>With one voice the people of Somalia are calling for an end to war and a return to government. They want the killing to stop and they want the militiamen off the street. </p> <p>\"The time is right,\" Ahmed Adan, a businessman, said. \"After a decade of hate and division we are tired of war. We want to put an end to this nightmare.\" </p> <p>So when thousands of Somali's took to the streets of Mogadishu last week to express their support for the peace conference in neighbouring Djibouti, it was a demonstration of collective relief that the nightmare might soon be coming to an end. </p> <p>The Djibouti talks appear to be on track to create a government, but public relief may not be enough to see any agreement through. </p> <p>All 12 previous attempts at putting back together the pieces of Somalia have failed, and it will take more than the optimism of Somali people to make the 13th the lucky one. </p> <p>Although the opposing power groups all want to see a government established, they want it for different reasons. </p> <p>Businessmen want a laissez-faire government that will allow business to prosper. Religious leaders seek an Islamic government and the imposition of sharia law. Refugees want a government that will provide water, food and basic services. The young militiaman just wants to be able to go to school. </p> <p>When Marxist dictator Siad Barre fled the country in 1991, Somalia fell into the hands of warring clan-based militias fighting one another to fill the political void. </p> <p>Somalia's cities were reduced to rubble and millions of people were driven from their homes. Millions more were killed or died of famine. The UN, backed by the US, tried to intervene and restore order, but it failed and withdrew in 1994. </p> <p>Sheikh Hassan Dahir, sitting quietly behind his mahogany desk while his minions bustled around him, said: \"We support the Djibouti conference 100%. People need order and discipline in their lives.\" </p> <p>He said that he would support a secular government, but remained certain that the Islamic courts which he set up would keep their power under a new government. </p> <p>But according to the faction leader Hussein Aidid this is the last thing Somalia needs. </p> <p>\"Of course I support a government, but it must exclude the Islamic courts,\" he said. \"They are financed by the Taliban and Osama bin Laden.\" </p> <p>He fancies a government with himself at the helm, as do the other warlords whose militias have destroyed this once beautiful city. </p> <p>But nobody is paying much attention to the warlords these days. Mr Aidid and his supporters are clinging to a lost ideal, reluctant to accept that the tide of Somali politics has turned against him and the other warlords of Mogadishu. </p> <p>Mr Adan and his business partners returned from exile in Canada last year. They gave up comfortable lives and well-paid jobs and have invested more than a million dollars in Somalia's first independent television and radio station. </p> <p>\"We felt the time was right to come back and invest in the future of Mogadishu,\" Mr Adan said. </p> <p>\"Somali's are tired of war and everybody wants peace.\" </p> <p>But every now and then the conversation drops off in the face of a fierce gun battle which is taking place on the street just outside their offices - a timely reminder that it is too soon to write off what remains of the warlords' power and, more importantly, their arsenals of weapons. </p> <p>Around the time that Mr Adan returned from Canada, Abdi Sabrie was putting the finishing touches to a pasta factory he had built in Mogadishu's old industrial area. </p> <p>Mr Sabrie has grown rich from the absence of bureaucracy but is tired of having to pay protection money for his security, tired of having to generate his own electricity and find his own water. </p> <p>Even the militiamen now say they want to see the restoration of government. </p> <p>Mohamed Farah sat slumped in the tattered armchair with a Kalashnikov rifle, safety off, lying across his knees. Nicknamed \"Five Bullets\" for the number of times he's been shot, he monotonously chewed the tight bundle of khat stuffed inside his cheek. </p> <p>\"I don't want to fight anymore,\" he said. \"I'd rather go to school.\" </p> <p>But for the vast majority of Somali's there are no ifs or buts, us or them. They have nothing to lose and any form of government would suit them. </p> <p>Spread right across Mogadishu wherever the space will allow, makeshift refugee camps have sprung up, comprising thousands of dome shaped huts hastily erected with just a few feet separating one from the next. </p> <p>Fadumo Abdukadir has lived with her eight children in one such camp for the last eight years. </p> <p>\"Take a look around you,\" she said pointing towards the poverty of her surroundings. </p> <p>\"We have no food, no medicine and no hope. We don't care what kind of government we get. We just want help.\"</p>",
  "It took a while to realise that the answer was curved, smooth, shiny and encasing my head. Other heads too, tens of thousands of them, all stuck inside metal containers which give Monkee haircuts. <p>Motorcycle helmets are hot, uncomfortable, and a pain to carry around, and they are everywhere: on bankers, teenagers and tourists; on bar stools, cafe tables and desks; above all, they are on Roman minds. </p> <p>Most do not want to wear them. They want wind in the hair and absence of hassle, which they had until a law in March made helmets compulsory. Too many people were dying (1,185 nationally in 1998) and the government said 'enough'. Those caught without would be fined \u00a380. </p> <p>Overnight the city was transformed. Scooter and motorbike riders looked blocky instead of zippy. No longer, though God knows some tried, could they use mobiles. Eating an ice cream became fraught. </p> <p>Politicians, footballers and pop stars posed with helmets, but it was little consolation to teenagers who pulled up at discos with gelled tresses turned into bowlers. Businessmen complained that they looked silly carrying helmets into meetings. </p> <p>The whingeing has not stopped, if anything it is louder now, because of the heat. But an astonishing fact remains: unlike the widely flouted seat-belt law, this one is being obeyed. Except for a few tearaways at 3am, everyone wears a helmet. </p> <p>In a city where rules are supposedly made for bending, it is a miracle of law enforcement. Contrary to expectations, the police are vigilant, and contrary to cliche, the natives are acquiescent. </p> <p>Therein lies the answer, or part of the answer, to a complex question: does the south of Italy begin after Rome, or in Rome? </p> <p>Ask a Milanese and he will boot the capital deep into the backward south, the mezzogiorno, where his taxes are pocketed by layabouts and incompetents with no respect for order. Ask a Calabrian and he will place Rome far into the industrial north, where automata follow edicts from the state. </p> <p>By complying Rome has bolted itself to the north, distancing itself from the bare heads that remain the norm in Naples, Palermo and Reggio di Calabria. </p> <p>It is a significant breach. Newspapers and cabinet ministers have declared the helmet law evidence of Italian maturity and discipline, a respect for law and common sense befitting modern Europeans. </p> <p>There is a catch. Rather than endure a helmet, the mature, disciplined, sensible and modern Europeans of Rome are using more cars and taxis, worsening the already nightmare congestion. </p> <p>Those who stay on two wheels abandon their 50cc Piaggios for maxi-scooters with roofs and 500cc engines. </p> <p>Now that you have to wear a helmet you may as well be able to exceed 80mph, goes the logic. One of the monsters almost ran me over the other day. I screamed till I was blue but the rider sailed on, muffled from all abuse.</p>",
  "Unless you're hooked on Slush Puppies and their kith and kin, you have to admit that granitas have never enjoyed remotely the same popularity outside Italy as have ice creams or sorbets. Yet, of all the ices, they are by far the easiest to make, requiring no higher technology than a freezer, a suitable tray in which to freeze them and a fork. <p>It may well be that this very simplicity has worked against them. One can easily imagine the shrieks of horror from culinary platforms at the very idea of food that can be made without sweat and tears, at something as absurdly simple as a cordial or syrup flavoured with a fruit or an essence that is then placed in a freezer and left to turn crystalline. However, the case for the defence is as simple and elegant as the recipe for the accused: the ingredients must be of the highest calibre - the strawberries or raspberries, say, must be suitably ripened under the sun with ne'er a trace of green or blemish; the coffee must be a superior espresso; the wine must be of very sound quality; and so on and so on. </p> <p>But the result - the delicate crunch of the crystals between the teeth, the sensation of those same crystals dissolving back to the liquid from which they were formed, releasing the essence of fruit, claret or coffee (you can make granitas out of just about anything) - is as sensuous, refreshing and pleasing as anything produced by its close cousins. And because granitas contain less sugar than ice cream or sorbets, you could say that they are better for you. </p> <p>Appealing to look at, delicious to eat and refreshing, too, granitas are the epitome of stylish, economic, great eating, as anyone who has sat in the Piazza del Popolo in Rome with a thick, glass dish filled to the brim with the dark brown slush of a granita di caffe, capped with a froth of whipped cream, will tell you. And Rome is as good a place as any to eat a piece of history, for granitas must be closest to the original sherbets (the habit of cooling drinks with handfuls of snow or ice) of Turkey and Arabia from which all ices sprang. </p> <p>These days it may be virtually impossible to imagine a time when refrigeration was not a simple fact of everyday life, and when an ice-cream machine was the great indulgence and sole preserve of the devoted gourmet. That now being the case, it is easy to see why a granita would not thrill a public as it must have done in the days when ice came into the cities by cart or barge. The satisfaction of making a gorgeous, creamy custard, rich with egg yolk and cream, and flavoured with a fruit or essence, is immense and the result sublime. However, there is a knack to making ice cream, and it must be eaten swiftly, as it diminishes in quality the older and firmer it becomes. Granita, on the other hand, keeps very well indeed for several days in a sealed container in the freezer. </p> <p>The passion for granita waned outside Italy with the rise in popularity of ice cream; fair enough, I suppose. But does it then not appear strange that the Italians still love granita and ice cream and sorbet, whereas we seem to have the capacity to handle only one at a time. This oversight is even more extraordinary given the great reign of terror of food scares that we are currently living through, as granitas are both light and healthy, and haven't even a trace of dairy or any ingredient that kills on sight. </p> <p>So, the next time that tub of sorbet falls into your shopping basket at the supermarket, pause for a moment, think \"granita\", and then go and have another look at the fruit section or the coffees or the wine department. Nothing could be easier. Promise. </p> <p> All recipes serve six. </p> <p><b> Lemon granita</b><br> It is worth noting that sugar cubes can be used here, so that they can first be rubbed over the skin of the lemon, thereby absorbing the oils and intense flavour therein. In fact, this was once standard practice, and a pleasing job for those with the time and inclination to make a most simple but marvellously flavoured ice. </p> <p><b> 6-7 untreated lemons <br> 1 litre water <br> 250ml caster sugar</b> </p> <p>If the prospect of applying a sugar cube to the lemon zest bores you, then simply grate the zest from the lemons, taking care not to scrape off even the merest hint of pith. Halve the zested lemons, squeeze out the juice and strain it. Put the sugar, water and lemon zest into a pot, and place it over a medium heat. Cook, stirring, until the sugar has dissolved completely, taking care that the mixture does not come to the boil, or the flavour may turn bitter. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool. </p> <p>Once the syrup has completely cooled down, pour in the lemon juice, stir to combine, then tip into a deep-sided dish and place in the freezer. After half-an-hour or so, break up any ice that has formed with the tines of a fork - the crystals will form first on the outside, so scrape them into the more slushy matter in middle of the dish. Repeat every half-hour or so, until the whole dish consists of lemon-spiked ice crystals. Cream need not appear on this granita, though its presence is very pleasant. </p> <p><b> Coffee granita</b><br> In saying that there is no machinery involved in making granita, a very good espresso machine would be most helpful in making the coffee for this one. At Bibendum, we used to pour a small spoonful of intense coffee syrup over the cream. </p> <p>For the granita </p> <p><b> 1 litre very good, strong, black coffee (preferably espresso) <br> 4 tbsp caster sugar</b> </p> <p>For the syrup </p> <p><b> 75g ground coffee <br> 50g caster sugar <br> 300ml water</b> </p> <p>To finish </p> <p><b> 150ml double cream</b> </p> <p>Dissolve the sugar completely in the coffee, and pour it into a deep-sided dish to cool. Once cold, place the dish in the freezer. After-half-an hour, take a fork and give the coffee a stir to break up the clumps of crystals, and repeat every half-hour or so until the granita is made. Cover, and leave in the freezer until ready to serve. </p> <p>Now make the syrup. Put the sugar, coffee and water in a saucepan and place over a medium heat. Bring the pot to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes, until the liquid is syrupy. Pour through a very fine sieve and leave to cool. (This syrup keeps very well in the fridge, and goes very well over a decent vanilla ice cream, incidentally.) </p> <p>Whip the cream until soft peaks have formed. Spoon the granita into a pretty glass, lay a spoonful of cream on top, and trickle over a teaspoonful of syrup. </p> <p><b> Strawberry granita</b><br> This is delicious and very pretty, but only if the strawberries are very good. Raspberries work very well, too, though they may require a little additional sugar. </p> <p><b> 1.2kg strawberries <br> lemon, juiced <br> orange, juiced <br> 225g caster sugar <br> 140ml water</b> </p> <p>Hull the strawberries, pop them into the blender and whizz to a liquid. Pass through a fine sieve and set aside. In a small pan, dissolve the sugar in the water over a medium heat and bring just to the boil. Simmer for five minutes, then remove from the heat and set aside to cool right down. Once cooled, add the syrup to the strawberry mixture, along with the orange and lemon juices, and stir to combine. Pour into a deep-sided dish, place in the freezer and proceed as in the preceding recipes. Cream really is not required here - I mean it this time - and the addition of a sprig of mint is absolutely forbidden. </p> <p><b> Elderflower granita with gooseberry fool </b><br> A fabulous combination, and a charming use for all that cordial made in the short, swift elderflower season. </p> <p><b> 500ml elderflower cordial <br> 500ml water</b> </p> <p>For the fool </p> <p><b> 500g gooseberries <br> 125g caster sugar <br> 140ml thick double cream</b> </p> <p>Mix the cordial with the water, pour it into a deep-sided dish and place it in the freezer. Make the granita in the usual manner. Put the sugar into a pot with the gooseberries, and cook very gently until the fruit has softened. Push the gooseberry mixture though a sieve and set aside to cool. Lightly whip the cream, and stir into the gooseberry pur\u00e9e. </p> <p>To serve, put some granita into six pretty glasses and top with a generous spoonful of fool. (Keep the rest of the fool to eat with thin almond biscuits) </p> <p><b> Technical tips</b></p> <p>\u0095 Granitas are low-tech ices made from fruit juices, cordials or other liquids, sugar, lemon and water. You can't make granita in an ice-cream machine. The only equipment you need is: one shallow plastic freezer-proof container; one fork; one freezer.</p> <p>\u0095 They are supposed to be coarse, grainy ice crystals. You can't make a granita straight from the juice of a pectin-rich berry or pulpy fruit, as the crystals will be too small. You must add water to them to get the larger crystal effect.</p> <p>\u0095 You use less sugar than you would in other ices. The more sugar, the finer the crystal. You can't make granitas with a lot of sugar (9-10 degrees Baume for the technically minded), because you would lose the classic grainy texture, the mixture would go all sticky and smooth, and it would cease to be a granita and become a water ice instead.</p> <p>\u0095 Freeze the mixture for one hour in the plastic container. Stir the crystals that form around the edge of the container with a fork. Repeat the process every 30 minutes or so, until all the liquid has turned to soft, grainy crystals - this can take up to 2 hours.</p> <p>\u0095 If the mixture freezes solid, you can break it up in the food processor, but the crystals will be too fine for the true granita effect.</p> <p>\u0095 According to the irreplaceable Ice - The Definitive Guide, by Caroline Liddell and Robin Weir, 'To achieve the perfect granita, there is no substitute for the fork technique'.</p> <p>\u0095 Granita is at its best when eaten the moment it is ready. However, it will keep quite happily for several days in the freezer, if needed, although it will solidify considerably. In this eventuality, take it out of the freezer about an hour before you want to eat it, leave to defrost slightly, then beat again with a fork, and pop back in the freezer until needed.</p> <p>\u0095 Jeremy Lee is the chef at Blue Print Cafe, Butlers Wharf, London SE1.</p>",

  "<p>When Hitler came to power on January 30 1933 it was obvious that anti-Semitism would spread. For years he had made it plain that he hated the Jews and his stormtroopers had beaten them up in public all over Germany. Most Germans realised what would happen when he won power but, in the easy way that people talk about what might happen in politics, even in Germany, people said it wouldn't last;they believed that the old politicians would control him. They soon found out they were wrong.</p> <p> A law for the reconstruction of the civil service was propagated on April 7 - not voted in; government by parliamentary vote had been abolished in March. Reconstruction of the civil service was a euphemism for dismissing Jews from state appointments; that mattered in academic life because nearly all universities were state run.</p> <p> Germany was ahead of all other nations scientifically. It had won a third of the 99 Nobel prizes for science given before 1933 (Britain had won 18, the US six). Hitler expelled 27 scientists who had, or would later win, Nobel prizes. No country could stand that loss. It was years after Hitler's era before Germany began to win Nobel prizes again.</p> <p> Immediately, rescues were organised from London by the Academic Assistance Council (AAC) created specifically to help German academics. Although the Jewish and non-Jewish political opponents of the Nazis were quickly expelled or intimidated, few had had the chance to make any plans before January 30. There was an exception: a Hungarian physicist born in 1898, Leo Szilard. </p> <p>He came from Budapest but like any ambitious scientist - physicists especially - he made for Berlin, the world centre of his subject. It was not easy. There was active anti-Semitism in Hungary and in Germany he felt the threat was even worse. In the years before Hitler achieved power, Szilard taught himself theoretical physics and even got Einstein to teach him statistical mechanics. He was recognised as a genius even by Einstein, Max Planck, Heisenberg, Nernst, Franck and others in Germany. But he always knew that the situation would not last. He was ready to leave at any time and kept his bag packed and beside him.</p> <p> When he left, he bought a first class ticket to Vienna thinking he was less likely to be taken off the train if he was in first class. He started to make contact with intellectuals outside Germany. He went first to Geneva where he found a famous English professor, William Beveridge, in the same hotel.</p> <p> Szilard's idea was to start a university in exile. Beveridge had thought of it, too, but they soon realised that it would be much more effective to bring refugee scientists to British (and other) universities. Beveridge sent Szilard to London, and Szilard needed no more encouragement.</p> <p> By the time Beveridge returned to London, Szilard had been lent two rooms in the Royal Society (the rooms were small but the address was good). The hospitality had been arranged by Lord Rutherford, President of the Royal Society, the man who split the atom and was a leader in the rescue effort. (The great man said in 1933 that the possibility of using atomic energy for industrial or military purposes was mere moonshine.)</p> <p> Szilard's method of working was unusual. Work for him meant thinking. He stayed in the West End at the Strand Palace Hotel (although he had no money) and every day for a month he soaked in a hot bath all morning, thinking.</p> <p> When not thinking about theoretical physics, he was doing all he could to find places for other refugees, who were coming out of Germany in hundreds. Later many went on to the US, but the immediate rescue operation was based in London and led not only by Beveridge and Rutherford but other distinguished academics, such as AV Hill, biological secretary of the Royal Society.</p> <p> He delighted in tormenting the Nazi scientific establishment, which regarded Einstein's theories and even theoretical physics generally, as Jewish physics. Among all these great men was a characteristic English figure: Tess Simpson, a young law graduate and musician who wanted to do good. She worked as assistant to the director of the YMCA in Geneva - pleasant enough but not fulfilling. So when Szilard offered her the job of secretary of the AAC (at a third of her previous salary) she jumped at it. She stayed for the rest of her life. </p> <p>This Yorkshire lass helped the AAC rescue 2,600 refugees, including the world's greatest scientists, finding them jobs, money and resources. They loved her. Long afterwards, at her 90th birthday party, the two men who proposed her health were both members of the Order of Merit, Sir Ernst Gombrich and Max Perutz, Nobel Laureate. </p> <p> Szilard was waiting for the traffic lights to change in Southampton Row, Holborn, when he suddenly was inspired by the idea of atomic fission and the energy it could release. He made a practical mistake about chain reaction, pursuing the bombarding of beryllium, which does not split, rather than uranium, which does. But he knew the dangerous truth that atomic fission was possible; indeed that its discovery was inevitable. All the facts were widely available and there were still brilliant scientists in Germany, Heisenberg among them; they were as capable as the US or the UK of developing an atomic bomb.</p> <p>Szilard could be a pest. He pestered everyone he knew, and he knew them all, to realise what was happening. When atomic fission was discovered, he urged that there should be no publication of the fact. If the Germans knew about it, there might be no way of stopping them making a bomb. Hitler had ways of persuading scientists to obey him. Most American and British colleagues agreed with Szilard about the need for secrecy, but an important paper was nevertheless published in Paris. </p> <p> Szilard played a crucial role in alerting the US government to the possibilities and dangers of atomic fission. He, with fellow-refugees Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller, persuaded Albert Einstein to write to President Roosevelt on August 2 1939, warning him of what was happening and suggesting that the US government should start to explore the situation. However, the US did little for two years, until it came into the war on December 7 1941.</p> <p> Luckily, none of this mattered. The process of manufacturing a nuclear bomb, especially the need to purify the uranium isotope 235 (which constitutes less than 1% of unrefined uranium) was much more complicated and difficult than was realised. In the end, even the Americans with their vast resources, space and freedom from bombing, did not finish making a bomb until after the end of the war against Germany.</p> <p> Heisenberg and other German atomic physicists were gathered up at the end of the war in Europe and interned in a house near Cambridge, where their conversations were secretly recorded. They were astonished when they heard the public announcement of the dropping of the first atomic bomb on August 6 1945. Heisenberg refused to believe it for a week and, when he repeated his own calculations, realised that he had made a fundamental mistake. The idea that he and the other German scientists deliberately refrained from giving Hitler an atomic bomb, which he would have had no compunction about using, really is mere moonshine.</p> <p> Among those scientists whom Szilard badgered in the US was the notable Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. He had arrived to work in America very stylishly. In December 1938 he went from Rome to Stockholm to receive the Nobel Prize, and then, instead of returning to Italy, took a boat to New York. Many of his friends and colleagues were already there and he was made very welcome, as was Niels Bohr, \"the great Dane\", who a few weeks later arrived from Europe with the news that Otto Hahn had achieved fission in Berlin. The effect was electric. All the physicists immediately saw the significance if the event, and some were even said to have left Bohr's lecture before its end to return to their laboratories to confirm the findings. Fermi went to Chicago University, where Szilard joined him.</p> <p> On December 2, 1942 he achieved the first chain reaction . They drank chianti from plastic cups, though hardly in celebration - Szilard said: \"This will go down as a black day in the history of mankind.\" Once a chain reaction - produced in a former squash court under a football stadium in Chicago - had been converted through prodigious effort to the building of a workable atomic bomb, Szilard was against using it, as were nearly all the other physicists involved. They favoured a warning to Japan or a demonstration on an uninhabited island. Many, including Einstein, were horrified that the bomb should be dropped on civilian populations. But it was a political, not a scientific, decision. </p> <p> Szilard was frantic to reach President Truman to persuade him not to use the bomb. So persistent was he that he was even suspected of treachery by General Leslie Groves, head of the Manhattan Project that had developed the bomb. Groves petitioned the secretary for war, Henry Stimson, to dismiss or imprison him. He had Szilard tailed by the FBI - they followed him even to the ceremony where he became an American citizen; the agents reported that he \"speaks occasionally in a foreign tongue\". Stimson was too sensible to pay attention to Groves; but Groves did win the battle to stop Szilard from reaching the president. </p> <p> After the war, Szilard worked for the Pugwash conferences of international physicists, trying to keep atomic energy under civilian control. He moved to Washington to promote arms control, including opening up a hotline to the Soviet Union's Nikita Khrushchev. </p> <p> When he was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1959, he directed his own radiation treatment. Even among the remarkable collection of brains who fled Germany - unique in history - Szilard stands out. Perhaps he might have achieved even more if he had been more consistent and persistent. Some of his colleagues thought just that, but he made so many contributions to the good of the world that it is difficult to fault him; he was an eccentric genius. </p> <p> This article is based on the book, Hitler's Gifts, by David Pyke and Jean Medawar, to be published next month by Richard Cohen Books at \u00a320.</p>"
