  "Tony Blair did his best to put pale blue water between Labour and the Tories this afternoon by telling voters they face a clear choice: social commitment from Labour or irresponsible extremism from the opposition. In doing so he delivered a speech which was arguably his most \"old Labour\" since he took office in 1997. <p>Though in parts it read like Majorism warmed up and at other points like a leader feigning contrition, there was a passion and an energy to the prime minister's delivery which both reassured and enlivened the conference. Within minutes of the start of his address Mr Blair had proved that he had not lost his nerve.</p> <p>The prime minister repeatedly highlighted the differences between the two political forces, presenting Labour as the party of mature government and the Conservatives as the party of cuts.</p> <p>Significantly, he also set out what he called his \"irreducible core\": a clear, and largely successful, effort to overcome his image as a failing, rootless populist. In a passage which was presented as an unscripted aside (but which gave the appearance of having been rehearsed) the prime minister ran through a shopping list of actions he was not prepared to take but, he said, the Tories would - from \"sticking two fingers up\" at Europe to attacking asylum seekers and cutting overseas aid.</p> <p>His own pale blue shirt was left dripping with sweat after the 56-minute address, which earned him a standing ovation lasting 4 minutes and 26 seconds - one second longer than the applause yesterday for chancellor Gordon Brown.</p> <p>Today's speech was an attempt by Mr Blair to stamp his authority on the party after splits over pensions and petrol and a Downing Street \"poison squad\" accused of undermining the chancellor. Admitting that the government had \"taken a knock\", the prime minister accepted responsibility for its fall in the polls. He apologised for the Dome and made it clear that pensioners would get a significant rise, admitting he had \"got the message\" that this year's 75p rise was a mistake - though he ruled out any linking of future increases to wages.</p> <p>Mr Blair set out an unashamedly tough policy on law and order, including renewed backing for on-the-spot fines. The idea sparked ridicule when it was first floated and was swiftly dropped.</p> <p>The old \"s\" word, socialism, was not used once but Mr Blair employed a new \"s\" word, solidarity, in a passage that could apply to his feuding ministers as much as the country.</p> <p>Mr Blair said he believed in \"that old principle of solidarity, that by standing shoulder to shoulder you get more out of this life instead of fighting each other as isolated individuals\".</p> <p>The prime minister sketched out Labour's next election manifesto, promising that a commitment to raise again the share of the nation's wealth spent on schools and training would be the first line of a new contract with voters. \"Education. Education. Education. Then, now and in the future,\" he said.</p> <p>Rattling through a list of core issues concerning voters, he committed himself to action against cancer. \"Under plans we publish tomorrow, there will be 1,000 more cancer specialists over the next six years - up nearly a third,\" he said. \"By 2003 for the first time the government will be matching pound for pound charity funding for cancer research.\" That pledge had echoes of Bill Clinton, who launched his own attack on cancer earlier this year.</p> <p>There was no escape from the problems over pensions and petrol that have rocked the government in the past two weeks. A humbler Mr Blair vowed to listen but a defiant streak also emerged as the two sides of the politician competed for the support of the electorate. He promised he was listening to the nation's grievances - but set popular concern about tax on some issues against demand for higher spending on others.</p> <p>\"I am listening to people's anger over fuel duties. For hauliers and farmers, to say nothing of ordinary motorists, there is real hardship,\" he said.</p> <p>\"But I have also had to listen over underfunding in the NHS, over extra investment in schools, over more police on the beat, over public transport.</p> <p>\"I am listening over mortgages, where low interest rates can only be maintained if disciplined public finances are kept.</p> <p>\"I am also listening to pensioners who believe the government should give them a greater share of the country's prosperity... and I will act.\" But he stressed: \"The world is full of competing causes, most of them good.\"</p> <p>One of those competing causes is, of course, Mr Blair's bid to win a second term in office and the coming election ran through his words like lettering in a seaside stick of rock. Did he do enough today to win back the electorate's confidence? Not quite, not yet - but the prime minister's speech, like the chancellor's yesterday, certainly made a good case for the Labour fightback.</p> <p>Tipped for bronze, the prime minister and his chancellor have certainly won silver this week - and if the reaction in the media pen afterwards is to be trusted, they might even be said to have brought home an unexpected gold.</p>",
  "<p>Anti-capitalism protesters today marched on the IMF and World Bank summit in Prague, throwing firebombs at police, who responded with tear gas and water cannons.</p> <p>Activists conducted a stand-off on a bridge on the route to the communist-era Congress Center in which the summit was today inaugurated, chanting \"Stop the economic terror now\" in protest against the two global lending institutions they call a menace to humanity. Official police figures placed their number at around 5,000; journalist sources say it might be double that, or more.</p> <p>Several policemen were set alight by Molotov cocktails and colleagues hosed them down with a water cannon. Dozens of people are reported to have been hurt.</p> <p>Earlier this morning, two people suffered head injuries during street fights and demonstrators threw rocks at a McDonald's outlet, cracking the glass door.</p> <p>The protesters have vowed to halt the meetings, arguing that the Washington-based institutions ignore the needs of the poor, decimating quality of life for millions. Some activists paraded outside the meeting, waving banners saying, \"Making love not trade\".</p> <p>Student Hans Jurgen from Bergen, Norway, turned out wearing a green hat festooned with dollar signs - a walking, talking caricature of globalisation's fat cats. \"I have children for lunch and I kill people in many countries of the world,\" Jurgen said.</p> <p>South African finance minister and conference chair Trevor Manuel said it was a pity the protests had \"descended into violence\" and queried activists' motives. \"I know what they're against but have no sense of what they're for,\" he said.</p> <p>World Bank president James Wolfensohn asked conference attendees to recognise the \"legitimacy\" of the protesters' concerns. \"Outside these walls young people are demonstrating against globalisation. I believe deeply that many of them are asking legitimate questions, and I embrace the commitment of a new generation to fight poverty. I share their passion and their question, but I believe we can move forward only if we deal with each other constructively and with mutual respect,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Wolfensohn furthered conceded the IMF and World Bank had a \"lot to learn\" about improving their efforts to combat poverty.</p> <p>The annual meeting proceeded as planned inside the building, with speeches from Czech president Vaclav Havel and Mr Manuel. </p> <p>The new managing director of the IMF, Horst Koehler, talked of the problems of globalisation: \"I am aware of the critical debate about globalisation, and many questions raised have to be of concern to all of us. But I also want to be clear: if the IMF did not exist already, this would be the time to invent it. More than ever, globalisation requires cooperation, and it requires institutions which organise that co-operation.\"</p> <p>Both Koehler and Mr Wolfensohn called for greater action to lift the living standards of the world's poor, focusing on better education and health care. Mr Koehler called on rich countries to lower their trade barriers on exports of farm goods and other products from poor countries, saying this could mean $100bn (\u00a366bn) annually in extra sales by poor nations. </p> <p>Mr Wolfensohn said that the processes tying the world more closely together economically cannot be stopped. \"We cannot turn globalization back. Our challenge is to make globalization an instrument of opportunity and inclusion - not of fear and insecurity,\" he said.</p> <p>The 15,000 delegates were transported at 5am this morning by bus to the conference centre. Czech police had conducted stringent border controls in recent days to ensure the conference took place without impediment, stopping almost 300 people with arrest records from previous anti-capitalism rallies. The authorities also deployed 11,000 police to strengthen security in Prague. </p> <p>Alice Dvorska, spokeswoman for one of the main activist umbrella groups at Prague, the Initiative Against Economic Globalization, condemned police interference: \"We condemn this attempt of the Czech government to prevent people from exercising their democratic rights to freedom of speech, movement and gathering\". </p>",
  "In the most important speech of his political career, Tony Blair today set out his \"second-term vision\" to appreciative Labour party delegates. <p>The prime minister admitted he had \"made people angry\" over his handling of the fuel crisis, pensions and the Millennium Dome.</p> <p>In his keynote speech to the Labour party conference in Brighton, Mr Blair conceded that the government had suffered in the opinion polls over these issues.</p> <p>But he reminded the party faithful that Labour had created 1m jobs, increased public spending and strengthened the economy. He told delegates in Brighton he wanted to set out the big choices facing Britain. </p> <p>\"After the events of two weeks ago, it's no wonder the government has taken a knock,\" he said. \"It happened on my watch and I take responsibility.\"</p> <p>In a conciliatory gesture, Mr Blair said: \"There are things we have done that have made people angry and we should be open enough to admit it.\" He said he should have listened to people's \"agony\" over fuel duty - but added that he was also listening to those who wanted an increase in NHS spending, extra investment in schools, more police on the beat and better public transport. </p> <p>\"I owe you an explanation. Yes, petrol is expensive. But of the 14p rise since the Budget last year, 12p has been in the world oil price, which is why these protests have taken place all over the world. It's true that it's cheaper elsewhere in Europe, but VAT is often higher there, income tax is higher, business taxes are higher.</p> <p>\"All in all, Britain has the lowest overall tax burden of any large industrialised nation in the world except Japan and the USA.\" </p> <p>The prime minister admitted that many older people wanted a bigger pension but said he made no apology for helping the worst-off first.\"Seventy-five pence,\" he said. \"I tell you now, as Gordon [Brown] made crystal clear yesterday, we get the message. </p> <p>\"But I believe that when people reflect on the big fundamentals that determine our future - the economy, jobs, public services - we are doing the right thing and we are on the right track for Britain.</p> <p>\"We rejected returning to the earnings link. For the next two or three years we could afford it; but 10, 15 years down the line, it would have imposed a huge financial burden on a future generation that would have been unfair to them.\" </p> <p>For the first time, the prime minister expressed public regret over the Millennium Dome. He said: \"Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and if I had my time again I would have listened to those who said governments shouldn't try to run big visitor attractions.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair said that he was elected to lead and that he had to make \"decisions of destiny\" on Britain's behalf. The last government, he said, had locked Britain into a cycle of boom and bust that the Labour party had to draw to a close to create a budget surplus.</p> <p>\"Don't ever let them con this country into boom and bust again,\" he told delegates to applause.</p> <p>In a crowd-pleasing attack on the Tory party, the prime minister heaped derision on William Hague, who was always looking for a bandwagon \"and then three came at once\". \"Opportunism always knocks for William Hague,\" he said, before adding his name to the long list of conference speakers who mocked the Tory leader's alleged drinking habits. \"Everything makes sense after 14 pints: John Redwood looks sane. Michael Portillo looks loyal. After 14 pints, even William Hague looks like a prime minister... I don't think so.\" </p> <p>The Tories would only take Britain backwards, Mr Blair said. \"We are in a fight - and it's a fight I relish. For it is a fight for the future, the heart and soul of our country.</p> <p>\"Their policies may change every five minutes but their prejudices do not.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair said though his government should be \"proud of our record\" the party should be not become complacent. The prime minister received a four-and-a-half-minute standing ovation at the end of his speech.</p> <p><a name=\"A\"><b>Policies</b></a></p> <p><a name=\"A\">\u0095 10-year plan for the NHS<br>\u0095 The transformation of secondary education <br>\u0095 Cradle-to-grave poverty strategy<br>\u0095 Harnessing new technology to spread prosperity to all<br>\u0095 Making the streets safe and society strong<br>\u0095 10-year plan for modern transport <br>\u0095 Next steps to full employment </a></p> <p><a name=\"B\"><b>Key soundbites</b></a></p> <p><a name=\"B\"><b>Education: </b> \"Education.

  "Britain has granted an entry visa to the 26-year-old son of Muammar Gadafy, in a move that shows how much relations have thawed with Libya since sanctions were suspended last year. Next week a British trade mission heads there looking for business. <p>Saadi Gadafy, Libya's footballer of the year, will be the fourth family member to visit Britain within a few months.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said Saadi held no position in the Libyan government and would be making a private visit for medical treatment. This is what his visa application says; he has an injured knee. But Libyan opposition sources say he has long wanted to attend a British football match, and healthcare may take second place to that.</p> <p>In any case, the knee injury is likely to prove only a temporary setback. Since becoming president of the Libyan Football Federation as well as captain of the main Tripoli team and the national squad, Saadi has enjoyed great success.</p> <p>During his captaincy of Tripoli's al-Ahli team, the rival squad from Benghazi - also called al-Ahli (National) - has suffered defeats on and off the field.</p> <p>Benghazi is seen as a centre of opposition to the rule of Colonel Gadafy, and the only outlets for this opposition are the mosques and stadiums. </p> <p>At a match in Tripoli this summer, al-Ahli Benghazi had a 1-0 lead by half time but in the second half the referee helpfully imposed two penalties against it and allowed al-Ahli Tripoli an offside goal.</p> <p>Benghazi's players walked off but Saadi's guards ordered them back. Tripoli won 3-1. On July 20, Benghazi played against the team from al-Baydah - Saadi's mother's home town. So outraged were Benghazi fans at one penalty that they invaded the pitch and the game was abandoned.</p> <p>Returning home, the fans set fire to the local branch of the Libyan Football Federation. On August 28 the \"people's leadership\" in Benghazi dissolved the club, and four days later the club's headquarters were demolished and more than 50 fans arrested.</p> <p>Recognising, perhaps, that his efforts might have overstepped the mark, Saadi resigned from the federation. But it pleaded that without him it would be unable to go on. On September 5 Saadi was reinstated by his father.</p> <p>Other Gadafy family visitors to London include the colonel's daughter, Aisha, 23, and her half-brother Mohammed, 29, credited with a degree in nuclear engineering.</p> <p>They spent a few days at the Dorchester Hotel in July but left hastily after Aisha made a pro-IRA speech at Speakers' Corner. The colonel's second wife, Safiya, has also visited, as has the wife of Abdullah al-Senoussi, the head of Libyan intelligence.</p>",

  "\u0095 Eight foot wire mesh fences protect Tonytown's borders, keeping pensioners, gamekeepers, hauliers and other populist purveyors of Poujadist protests in the outside world. Entry to the mini-state is through airport-style security checks at border points operated by Group 4. Construction minister Nick Raynsford, turning up with government red box in left hand, discovered rank wins no privileges. The guards ran a check after refusing to believe he was the N Raynsford of HMG when he hopped off a bus rather than out of the back of a car. His lead-lined red box rendered the X-ray ma chine useless, the guards arguing he must open it so they could check all it contained was confidential papers. A compromise saw him required to sign a disclaimer promising to pay to rebuild the conference complex if he had smuggled in a bomb. <p>\u0095 Even Blair's babe, Leo, needs a passport in Tonytown and a photo security card is pinned to his romper suit after the premier decided to take him to the seaside. So will Nelson Mandela when he speaks on Thursday.

They cut out a picture to stick on his pass. </p> <p>\u0095 A particularly warm Tonytown welcome is extended to deputy PM John Prescott, cutting quite a dash in his new Friar Tuck haircut.

  "\u0095 It is a terrible thing to rake over old coals, but I see no reason why we can't flamb\u00e9 some tittle-tattle into a frothtastic cocktail. This particular bundle of froth relates to O'Mandy Mandelson's ill-fated mortgage with the Britannia Building Society, which will be a prime topic in Geoffrey Robinson's terrifically unspiteful new book. <p>According to a former employee at Britannia's headquarters in Leek, Staffordshire, the news that O'Mandy had fiddled his application led to such protests from other customers that the society had to dragoon in extra help. \"They had to put on extra people to handle all the complaints, even six months later. It drove everyone mad,\" says the leak from Leek. \"We have to inform the society if we so much as sub-let a room. But he was allowed to 'forget' a \u00a3373,000 loan,\" was typical of the complaints received. \"We did get quite a few,\" confirms press officer David Ginivan. </p> <p>The protesters all got the same reply assuring them O'Mandy had not received preferential treatment.

Spookily, page seven also reveals that Rosie will be discussing \"middle England's schizophrenic attitude to green issues\" at the Labour conference. This is an terrible misuse of the word schizophrenic, and once again we beg you Rosie: more tobacco in the \"green issues\" next time. </p> <p>\u0095 Frankly, this backbiting among the Labour frontbenchers really has to stop. According to the version of Gordon Brown's conference speech carried on the Labour party website, the chancellor had some harsh words for the secretary of state for social security: \"as the statement to this conference which alligator darling and I put to the economic policy commission last week\" </p> <p>\u0095 Give \"Sir\" Michael Caine half a chance and he'll bang on about how poorly he's been treated by the establishment in this country. \"The British press have always patronised me,\" he told journalists while picking up an award in San Sebastian last weekend. \"The middle-class press love putting down a working-class man - but the public idolise me, I'm a bloody icon,\" he modestly declared. He then zipped off to the Guggenheim gallery in Bilbao, which is normally closed on a Sunday but staff were happy to open it specially for a solitary working-class icon. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Clare Short will today cast the protesters besieging the annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Prague as \"Luddites\" with no constructive alternatives to the institutions they criticise. </p> <p>\"Those who want to stop globalisation are today's Luddites,\" the international development secretary will tell Labour delegates at Brighton. \"We understand their worries, but their call to halt historical change and tear down our international institutions offers no solution. The challenge of globalisation is to share the fruits of the new wealth across the world and usher in an era that eliminates abject poverty.\" </p> <p>In Prague yesterday, the protesters were preparing for today's showdown. Crammed elbow to elbow 200 \"carnivalistas\" splashed paint and glue around, putting finishing touches to papier mch\u00e9 globes and effigies of fat bankers, dribbling banknotes. In the centre of anti-globalisation activists - a disused shipyard - 50 or 60 groups, each of about 50 people, huddled in circles debating how to subvert capitalism. </p> <p>One startling thing is the diversity of the groups intending to surround the conference centre until the financiers agree to dismantle both institutions. There are groups from Italy connected to the zapatistas in Mexico, others calling for the rebirth of communism. </p> <p>What happens today is the first attempt at a European-wide coordinated protests against global institutions,with more than 20 nationalities taking part. \"Make protest as global as capitalism,\" read one of the banners being prepared yesterday. </p> <p>Prague may be the biggest but it is just one of 37 protests around the world against the World Bank/IMF today. Almost all the protesters in the Czech capital see themselves as part of a growing phenomenon which has so far not fully expressed itself or worked out what it wants or where it is going. </p> <p>Looked at closely, however, Prague is many protests by groups who would not normally even talk to each other, and many of whom are bitterly opposed. British anti-capitalists, as represented by the umbrella group Reclaim the Streets which directed the City riots in London, have a deep disrespect for the many socialist groups, whom they accuse of jumping aboard the bandwagon after Seattle. No one will talk to Oxfam, Christian Aid and War on Want who are widely dismissed as \"establishment\". </p> <p>\"The European experience is very confused,\" says Stefan Bienenfeld, a German who works with the Czech coordinating committee and has been observing the arrival of groups from across the continent. \"It is so far incoherent. That's why there are no demands or consensus\". </p> <p>One British activist admitted: \"The British are very isolated. The Germans are starting to work with the Poles and the French with the Spanish and Italians, but there is little debate or understanding.\"</p>"
