  "<p>Barclaycard, Britain's biggest credit card issuer, has abandoned its stand against the proliferation of low-cost, no-frills credit cards by quietly market-testing one of its own, it was revealed yesterday. </p> <p>In the past the company, with 7.8m cardholders, has consistently faced down calls to match the low rates on offer from new entrants and scrap its annual fee </p> <p>It has also always emphasised \"added-value benefits\" such as its loyalty scheme. </p> <p>But now, with no fanfare, it is inviting selected Barclays customers to sign up for Barclaycard Alpha, a new low-cost card it is trialling with \"minimal\" extra perks, broadly similar to rivals' offerings. </p> <p>The move is the latest indication of growing concern at Barclaycard about competition from new entrants, particularly US-based card issuers, retailers and online banks. While half of its card holders still pay a \u00a310 annual fee and its standard interest rate is 19.4%, there are more fee-free cards coming on to the market offering far lower introductory rates. </p> <p>Earlier this month RBS Advanta announced an introductory rate for purchases of 2.9%. American Express is spending millions of pounds relaunch- ing its green charge card. </p> <p>Barclaycard has opted not to publicise the Alpha card beyond those customers it is targeting, presumably because this could lead to a stampede among its existing cardholders to sign up for the cheaper deal. Barclaycard Alpha has no annual fee and a standard rate of 14.4% for purchases. </p> <p>In a statement, the company said it was test-marketing the new card as part of a development programme \"designed to provide customers with an increased choice of products and services, and to offer more tailored products to cater for the needs of individual cardholders\".</p>",
  "<p>Red Mullet - the exotic fish beloved of posher-than-thou dinner parties - are invading the North Sea. </p> <p>Usually found in the balmy Mediterranean, the fish are migrating north as a result of global warming. Scottish fishermen are catching red mullet in large numbers, while cod and whiting are dying because the water is too warm. </p> <p>Marine biologists say the North Sea is undergoing a rapid 'regime-shift' from a temperate sea to an almost sub-tropical one. </p> <p>In the last decade the amount of plankton - the 'grass of the sea' - has risen 10-fold (90-fold in the winters), and the level of life on the seabed has doubled. A study in the journal Science showed that the Nineties was the hottest decade in the last thousand years. Oceanographers have estimated that in six years the winter sea temperature around the Faroes has risen by 4 degrees centigrade. </p> <p>Red mullet, previously only found as far north as the English Channel, are now breeding off the west and east coasts of Scotland. Dr Chris Reid, director of the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science, said: 'There's enough to form a fishery.' Other warm-water species, such as anchovy and octopus, have been found in the Channel in the last year. </p> <p>Reid said: 'We are seeing an increase in bio-diversity in the North Sea. This is a very sharp change. It is almost certainly linked to global warming.' </p> <p>Plankton absorbs huge amounts of carbon dioxide and supports almost all other forms of life. The number of creatures on the bed of the North Sea, primarily starfish and worms, has thrived as a result of the increased plankton. </p> <p>But the changes may not benefit the fishing industry overall. Cod and whiting are being driven out and many of the new fish may not be so valuable as the old ones. 'The value of fishery might be reduced,' said Reid. </p> <p>Mathew Davis, of World Wide Fund For Nature, said: 'There are all sorts of invasive species going in, and they are a threat to native species.' The WWF will launch its Oceans Recovery Campaign this week demanding the Government give greater protection to fish stocks. </p> <p>However, the North Sea's life as a sub-tropical ocean may not last long. The melting of the Arctic ice-cap - already 40 per cent gone and expected to disappear by 2040 - is predicted to disrupt weather patterns so much that the north-east Atlantic will grow colder.</p>",
  "The role of government and what it should do to advance the cause of liberty was a raging debate when I was elected to Parliament in 1983. Then, one of the voguish ideas in town was 'libertarianism', which motivated a generation of excitable Young Conservatives to 'roll back the frontiers of the state'. <p>In my view, as a country we need to rediscover some of that scepticism about government and revisit that libertarian agenda. But we need to do it in a very different way and we should reach some different conclusions. Then, libertarians rightly wanted a market economy, but they wrongly wanted a market society, in which the cash bottom line counted above all else. They did tremendous damage to civic Britain. </p> <p>And though they spoke the language of individual rights, they were profoundly hostile to policies that would promote alternative lifestyles and diverse cultures. In contrast to that libertarian agenda, we need a liberal agenda, where government refuses to interfere in the lives of individuals, but plays a very active role wherever it can advance liberty for everyone. </p> <p>The liberal agenda has four key principles. First, government cannot solve all problems, and sometimes does more harm than good. Second, some problems are best left to government. It is far more able than the private sector to deliver health and education services that successfully tackle inequality. Third, we need clearer rules defining what government can and can't do; many decisions need to be taken at local and regional levels, rather than at Westminster. Fourth, central authority should be used to stamp out inequality rather than enforcing conformity. </p> <p>There is a curious assumption that individual freedom means the withdrawal of the state, and that taxation is a form of state control. The opposite should be the case. Taxation, efficiently gathered and efficiently spent, is not a curb on personal freedom - it is the means to achieve it. </p> <p>When power is exercised exclusively at the centre, the result is rigidity of rules and alienation of the people subject to those rules. This does not simply apply to the way Westminster retains control over the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly; it also applies to questions of lifestyle and parenting. </p> <p>New Labour needs to realise that family life and the way we raise our children are private matters. In its policies, we have seen, for example, serious attempts to discourage lone parents from staying at home with their children. Measures such as the New Deal and the Working Families Tax Credit encourage parents into a rigid model where the only way they can stay above the breadline is to work from nine to five, regardless of the needs of their children. This is grossly out of step with modern values. </p> <p>No government body is more notorious for over-legislation than the Department of Trade and Industry. There are numerous DTI regulations that are burdensome, unnecessary and undesirable. For instance, the so-called 'Tea Bag' tax forces employers to quote any free tea and coffee they lay on for employees as a 'taxable benefit in kind'. This is often impossible to calculate, but in one notorious case, an employer was fined \u00a36,000 by the Inland Revenue. Providing sandwiches can also be dangerous, since current legislation classes it as a taxable benefit as well as one which attracts National Insurance. Under such excessive legislation, employers find themselves with an incentive not to provide anything for their employees. </p> <p>Section 9 of the Conservative government's 1996 Immigration Act is no more forgiving. It makes it a duty of employers to police the visas and passports of their employees, threatening them with hefty fines if they allow people without the correct paperwork to continue working. This does not deter illegal immigrants from seeking work, since they are not penalised. It does, however, deter employers from hiring anyone foreign, out of the fear that they might land themselves in trouble. </p> <p>Under the Parental Leave Directive, employers who grant paternity leave can find themselves subject to criminal proceedings if the Inland Revenue judge their record-keeping to be sub-standard. Rather than spend time making certain their records are in order, many companies choose to avoid the risk by simply not granting paid paternity leave. We need to examine existing and pending legislation to ensure that it is clear, precise and, above all, minimal. We need to change the culture of government, so those in charge of the rule book come to understand that 'less equals more'. </p> <p>Government also needs to start respecting professionalism within the public sector, and curbing its desire to satiate people like teachers and nurses with paperwork and excessive regulation. Speaking to numerous teachers and nurses, I am consistently struck by the sense of mission they have about their work. But teachers report being unable to plan lessons with any degree of creativity, because they are too bound up with form-filling. Their paperwork has multiplied over the last decade, as have the number of rules governing the level of permissible contact between teachers and their pupils. Young people are reluctant to join these professions because they are not sufficiently respected in society. A telling feature of that lack of respect is the extent to which government over-legislates, thus lowering the status of and morale within these professions. </p> <p>When Labour came to power, tax was charged at 15 different levels. The budget of March 2000 took that figure to 38. There used to be three rates of income tax - now there are five. There were three levels of capital gains tax - now there are 21. This situation provides the opposite of transparency for the average citizen. It is very difficult for people and businesses to know how much tax they owe, and why. </p> <p>This proliferation of taxes also provides a smokescreen, whereby New Labour can claim to be helping people, but hitting them by less obvious means - so-called 'stealth taxes'. For instance, the Treasury claimed that the tax burden on the 'average family' has fallen to its lowest level since 1972. It only takes a little analysis to see that this 'average' family would have to be non-smoking, non-drinking, never fly abroad on holiday, not pay a mortgage and not pay council tax. These tactics undermine public confidence in government. The end-result of this undermining will be further alienation. The cynicism and disrespect with which people currently view the Government is a worrying sign that Labour is already losing the support it coveted for so many years, precisely because it is holding on to it so tightly. </p> <p>Restricting the freedom of individuals, pinning businesses and professionals down with legislation and befogging them with stealth taxes engenders a culture where government is viewed as an obstacle to success, not the means to achieve it. Britain deserves better. </p> <p>Charles Kennedy is leader of the Liberal Democratic Party</p>",
  "The price of peace in Northern Ireland for the Ministry of Defence may run to \u00a315 million. Thanks to the IRA ceasefires, the MoD is being sued for 'breach of contract and negligence'. <p>An Ulster-based construction company has issued a High Court writ against defence chiefs for multimillion-pound damages. J.H. Turkington &amp; Sons of Portadown claims that in December 1992 the company was contracted by the MoD to carry out a huge building programme to protect army and RUC bases in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>The military said that the work was 'urgently required' to fortify army barracks and police stations in response to the threat posed by the IRA's Mark 15 'barrack buster' mortars. </p> <p>At the time the IRA was carrying out an intensified campaign against the security forces with mortar bombs capable of piercing the fortifications around police and army bases. </p> <p>According to the writ, the company, which traded as Northern Builders, was asked by leading army officers to make 'suitable hardened structures' to strengthen security at the bases. </p> <p>The value of the emergency programme was estimated at \u00a3300m and the contract was meant to run for 10 years, the company claims. But then the IRA declared its first ceasefire on 31 August 1994 and three months later the MoD informed the company that the programme was being halted. </p> <p>The company claims that, as a result of the fortification contract being terminated, it is now owed \u00a315m in compensation and expenses for research, redevelopment and tooling. </p> <p>The MoD has filed a defence denying any liability and is also disputing the claim for damages. </p> <p>The case is expected to be heard at Belfast High Court in January, when a senior army officer involved in the original contract returns from a tour of duty in Kosovo. </p> <p>Legal sources in Belfast said that no written contracts had been exchanged between the company and the MoD. At the time the ministry wanted the work done as a matter of urgency, given the IRA's sustained Mark 15 attacks. </p> <p>The programme resulted in some bases having their outer walls fortified. The company also built an inner bunker inside several army and police stations known as 'The Cube', which was constructed to resist heavy mortar blasts. </p> <p>Israeli military engineers were flown in to design the fortifications. They used anti-blast technology they had developed while building military and government bases in Israel, the occupied territories and the former buffer zone in Lebanon. </p> <p>The Mark 15 'barrack buster' mortar was the most devastating weapon in the Provisional IRA's arsenal. A Provo engineer who lives along the South Armagh-Louth border and has since defected to the Real IRA developed it. </p> <p>The weapon, consisting of six gas cylinder tubes, each packed with 20kg of explosives, is welded to the trailer of a flatbed lorry before being fired over a perimeter wall using a remote control mechanism. The mechanism is similar to those used to trigger the smaller mortar bombs that were fired at Heathrow in 1994, causing widespread chaos at the world's largest airport. Between 1992 and 1994 the 'barrack buster' was fired in more than 50 attacks on RUC and army bases. </p> <p>The Real IRA used it again last Tuesday when the terror group launched an attack on a police station in Armagh City. No one was injured, but the blast confirmed fears that the dissident group now has the technical expertise to breach army and police fortifications. In July 1998 the Real IRA carried out a botched attack with the Mark 15 on a police station in Newry, Co Down.</p>",
  "Millions of forgotten Afghan refugees face a looming crisis this winter, caught between a life of grinding poverty in camps abroad and the prospect of returning to the harsh rule of the Taliban militia. <p>Pakistan and Iran, home to more than three million refugees who fled their homes after the Soviet invasion 20 years ago, are pressing to send the Afghans back, blaming them for high unemployment, crime and drug addiction. </p> <p>In an attempt to avert a disaster in the world's largest refugee population, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, met Pakistan's military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, last Friday and flies to Afghanistan today before heading for Iran. </p> <p>Western countries are reluctant to fund the refugees' repatriation while the Taliban are enforcing their brutally strict Islamic edicts. </p> <p>As a result, the Afghan refugees remain largely overlooked, victims of what Ogata calls 'asylum fatigue' and 'donor fatigue'. The UNHCR asked for $7.5 million for its Afghan programme this year, but received just $2m. </p> <p>'I think donors don't see a way through. The conditions in Afghanistan are a very big part of the equation,' said Ogata. </p> <p>'The international community has to be given clearer assurances of the intentions of the Taliban authorities on the issue of security, the treatment of women, education, health.' </p> <p>But their life outside the country is little better. In Pakistan's refugee camps in Peshawar, Quetta and Karachi, many Afghans go without proper healthcare or education. Poverty is the norm and long-term heroin abuse widespread. </p> <p>More than 60,000 Afghans have returned home from Pakistan this year. Each family is given just \u00a360, food and plastic sheeting to restart their lives. Many slip back into Pakistan within months. </p> <p>'We are under pressure from the host country,' a UN source said. 'There is a growing hostility to Afghan refugees in Pakistan. Many of them are going back out of desperation rather than deciding things are getting better.'</p>",
  "With the news that the hole in the ozone layer now embraces the tip of South America, and evidence that global warming is melting polar ice packs, it is not too late to think about doing your bit for the environment. <p> Certain green habits are cost-free. Start a compost with all your household's organic waste, from teabags to eggshells. Glass, paper, plastic and aluminium should all be recycled. Conserve water by taking showers instead of baths (consider sharing with a companion, for extra eco-friendliness). </p> <p>However, to take this planet-saving business seriously you are going to have to open your wallet. The key is reducing energy consumption: around 13 per cent of UK electricity output is used to wash clothes - and if electricity is not produced by inefficiently burning fossil fuels, it is produced by a possibly more dubious nuclear power plant. So spend a little more on a low-power 'Ecolabel' washing machine (from \u00a3420).</p> <p> Then choose an energy-efficient refrigerator - one that uses less than 150 kilowatts per hour annually. Hydrocarbon refrigerants (HC) have little effect on the ozone layer and global warming, unlike CFCs and HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons), and only add about \u00a350 to the cost of a fridge. </p> <p>Lightbulbs have not changed much since Edison's day - an electrical current is passed through thin metal wire and just 10 per cent of the energy is converted to light (the rest becomes heat). Unless you buy a \u00a315 Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) which uses 75 per cent less electricity, lasts 10 times longer than a standard bulb and pays for itself after 2,000 hours of use. </p> <p>The most environmentally sound mode of transport remains the bicycle, which is not only cheap but will also keep you fit. The average car produces 4.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide, 32.5kg of carbon monoxide and substantial quantities of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide each year.</p> <p> Optimists should also consider a solar-powered water heater (installations from \u00a3800 to \u00a33,000), while a photovoltaic power supply for your house's energy demands will be \u00a320,000.</p> <p> Perhaps the most effective way to save the planet is to set about buying it: you can protect an acre of rainforest for \u00a325 with Rainforest Concern. </p> <p> </p>",
  "With the exception of elderberries (available only in the wild), dark autumn fruits are easily obtainable.

  "It isn't possible yet to say how the new invented tradition of laying soft toys and flowers at the scene of an accident or other bloody event started, although the roots probably lie in the street shrines of South America and India. What is clear is that it was an artist, the American Mike Kelley, who was talking about dolls 'accenting the pathetic's darker side' and using stuffed animals in his work in the 80s, a decade or so before shopping-centre and suburban street-corner shrines became a familiar part of the emotional and media landscape in this country. <p>Kelley rescued chewed and smelly teddy bears and bunny rabbits from jumble sales and thrift stores and arranged them, clumped or individually, on dirty blankets on polished gallery floors. Although still virtually unknown here, Kelley has been a major influence on two generations of British artists who have used abject and degraded materials as a matter of course in their work. 'There are often unacknowledged but painfully obvious things going on around us,' Liam Gillick, who came through Goldsmiths with Sarah Lucas and Damien Hirst, once said. 'Kelley, and others such as Raymond Pettibon, Jim Shaw and Sue Williams have reinvigorated the debates around where we all stand in relation to shitting, dying, feeling paranoid and not really caring.' </p> <p>But for many years, Kelley had a hard time of it in America. He has made 'dolls' out of faeces. Nostalgic Depiction of the Innocence of Childhood shows a naked man and woman squatting on the floor astride soft toys. The man's buttocks are smeared with a dark chocolatey substance and he appears to be rubbing a fluffy rabbit up against himself. 'His body of work is often taken as a demonstration that art not only doesn't have to be appealing,' one critic has written, 'but that anything appealing in it is by definition not art.' Kelley's 'transgressive' representations of American life still tend to be viewed there as just another embodiment of its ugliness. </p> <p>I thought about Mike Kelley and his failure to return my calls (he is a notoriously reluctant interviewee) on the way to see Luc Tuymans in Belgium. Like Kelley, Tuymans is drawn to the banal and the dejected and to bilious, highly uncomfortable representations of childhood. Unusually (almost uniquely) for a sought-after young artist, Tuymans is a painter. His paintings typically have titles such as Repulsion , Embitterment , Incest , Resentment , Child Abuse , The Murderer . On a material level they are pitiable objects, thin and slapdash, the pictorial equivalent of Kelley's rag-doll installations. 'A lot of my imagery has a sense of coziness which is turned into something terrifying. Anything banal can be transformed into horror,' Tuymans has said. 'Violence is the only structure underlying my work.' </p> <p>Kelley and Tuymans are two of the dozen or so artists in Apocalypse, intended to be the autumn blockbuster show at the Royal Academy, designed to have them chewing the carpets in Great Missenden and Orpington. Subtitled Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art, Apocalypse is meant to be a kind of son-of-Sensation. In the show's catalogue, the co-curator Norman Rosenthal quotes Nietzsche on the importance of facing up to difficult knowledge, 'although it may be ugly and even deadly': 'Artists_ are best positioned to affect our knowledge by confronting us with a synthesis of new and often shocking realities_ The ability to look, make and map where no one has looked before is the aim of every artist and exhibition.' </p> <p>Already, though, a month before Apocalypse opened, David Lee, reliable no-goer and nay-sayer, had delivered his verdict to the London Evening Standard : 'Disgusting works with profane titles, profane works with disgusting titles, disgusting works with disgusting titles by disgusting artists'. Rosenthal is pissing in the wind. </p> <p> The day I travelled to Antwerp to meet Luc Tuymans was the day after the funeral of the murdered eight-year-old, Sarah Payne, and the newspapers all carried front-page stories and pictures. The Eurostar was full of the kind of photographs that had dominated the papers all summer: photographs of Sarah Payne's parents, her brothers and sister; photographs of floral tributes and Beanie Babies and weeping neighbours; photographs of the small white coffin in its Victorian hearse. </p> <p>The papers had also been full of other, angrier pictures all summer, in the wake of the News of the World 's 'name and shame' anti-paedophile campaign. Pictures of smashed windows and daubed houses and 'vigilante' marchers with children in prams and banners saying, 'People don't want no paedophiles here', 'No paedophile scum on this estate'. </p> <p>'Memes' is Richard Dawkins' word for those ideas that now and again surge through the culture, that proliferate and, sometimes, develop seemingly without specific ownership or particularity. When I had finished reading about Sarah Payne's funeral, I turned to the book of Luc Tuymans paintings that I had brought with me, and the commentary to the paintings that Tuymans had attached. Body , one of his best-known images, shows the headless and legless torso of a school-age girl. It is ghostly with a dull, cracked surface, and bled of all colour. 'It is the torso of a doll, with a zip fastener in the middle so you can open it up to put in stuffing and give it volume, a meaning,' Tuymans says of this small work. 'You can hardly see that the body looks as though it is injured, suffering the effects of cruelty. The zip fastener acts like a wound, like a cut.' </p> <p> Body is the painting of a child that is in fact a doll. Silence depicts a doll that turns out to be a child. It is equally anaemic, equally mute. 'Beneath its closed eyes, two colours appear, green and orange, which, taken together, form a superimposition. They indicate that the face is maimed from within, that it is ill,' Tuymans explains. 'It is as though the child has been infected by a virus which has spread through its whole body. The painting corresponds to complete silence.' </p> <p>There are others: Silent Music , which is an airless nursery room, stuffed with sinister furniture; Smell , based on the deodorant blocks you find in toilets; Incest , the abstraction of a hand sticking through something. The surface of Gas Chamber , on the other hand, which you would expect to be blackly sombre, is suffused with a honeyed orange glow. 'The picture radiates both fear and human warmth. That's actually its meaning. To approach the really terrible thing that cannot be depicted.' </p> <p>'Phantom figuration' and 'ghost painting' are some of the things Tuymans' style has been called. His pictures are universally bleak, gloomy even; indifferent; petrified. They seem shockingly casual - casually daubed with a scratchy brush while his mind was absent, thinking of something else. Tuymans' paintings are like half-thoughts; they are notoriously elusive (but they stay around - they are haunting; they haunt you): they have been likened to overexposed photographs or barely legible images on shrouds. </p> <p>We departed Lille and I flipped to the front of the book, where there was an interview with Tuymans. Q: 'Some of your paintings focus on the representation of childhood. Some details induce the viewer to think about childhood as fraught with horror, with unease, open to torment, abuse, ailment.' A: 'The idea of fear is pretty much embedded in my personality. Constant fear and constant uneasiness_ Fear of the dark, of physical mutilation, which were instilled very early on in me.' In answer to another question: 'For me, it's impossible to make a joyful painting.' </p> <p>His studio is in a working-class district of Antwerp, mainly occupied by Moroccans. Now aged 42, Tuymans has had the place - 'I regard it as a kind of protective shell' - for more than half his life. He doesn't live there any more, but it's pretty obvious that the cheerless atmosphere and air of near-dereliction sustain something that he needs for his painting, much as Francis Bacon liked to throw on dust, dirt, candle wax. (Norman Rosenthal says he found Tuymans' studio strongly reminiscent of Bacon's reeking, rubbish-strewn London studio in South Kensington.) Tuymans works on to unstretched canvas, nailed to the wall - paintings of King Leopold and other emblems of the Belgian imperium in the Congo; pictures that were uncharacteristic of Tuymans in their generosity of scale and use of colour and even allusions to a narrative element. Also some smaller works, painted on to newspaper, for an upcoming show in Japan. </p> <p>Most of his pictures depict rooms. Some of the rooms are evidently, or by implication, the scene of a crime. Bloodstains and Child Abuse are self-explanatory. Apple is the image of a decaying apple, taken from a police archive photograph of a murder scene. Tuymans works in a very small room with a big mirror. It can feel as if there's something a bit Rillington Place about it, a bit imminent and loaded - forensic, evidentiary - when you come to it fresh from the work. </p> <p>Plus, Tuymans isn't exactly overburdened with social skills. He seemed offhand and quite prepared to be disliked - always a good sign. He chain-smokes. He's arrogant. A mountain of dog-ends was spilling out of a deep bowl on to the floor. For an ashtray, he used the kind of small round mirror you expect to find in a budgie's cage; it sat on the arm of an armchair with its stuffing poking out looking, with the light swimming in it, like the kind of indeterminate, shifting image he likes to make in paint. A scab that turns out to be an embroidered flower. A skull that turns out to be the X-ray of a diseased tooth. An obscene gash that turns out to be the shadow thrown by a small girl's knee. </p> <p>Tuymans says he likes an image to stale. He picks it and then lets it hang around long enough to go dead on him, before he tries to embalm it in paint. No painting takes longer than a day, an unbreakable rule. There are preparatory drawings and watercolour sketches and then - indifferently, eventually - the small, malignly resonating, creepily beautiful, real thing. Occasionally the thing Tuymans finds on the wall staring back at him has the power to unnerve even him. This happened with Child Abuse . 'The colours are exagerrated, ugly. They glow dimly... I painted the picture quite unconsciously, and even I was shocked by the result... The idea of subversion, a perversity, becomes apparent in it.' </p> <p>Tuymans' work, like much of the work on show over the next three months at the Royal Academy, represents a kind of anti-sublime - what the artist Jake Chapman has called, only half-jokingly, a 'degenerate sublime'. It takes art about as far from the pleasure principle as it can be taken. In Tuymans' case, this is conscious. His work, he will patiently explain, sets out to reveal the cruelty and harshness of things. He despises a painter like Kandinsky for whom painting aspired to the condition of music. There's no place in Tuymans' life for music. He never listens to the radio. He told me he has never bought a record. 'Never. Not one. I have no urge to buy - what do you call them - CDs. I'm not so much interested in the spiritual aspect of culture - \"beauty\" or poetic descriptions of beauty don't seem real enough for me. Reality is actually far more important than any form of spirituality. Realism. It's much more interesting to crawl from underneath to the so-called top.' </p> <p>It is all a long way from Matisse, who spoke of his art of 'serenity, balance and repose' as providing restoration 'like a good armchair'. But maybe this is inevitable. Good art sucks in the psyche of its time, and our time isn't about beauty and order and the imitation of nature. Disorder, fear, Bacon's 'smell of death' were the central 20th-century experiences. </p> <p> Antwerp, where Tuymans lives, and Monchen gladbach on the German-Dutch border, where Gregor Schneider, another Apocalypse contributor, has a house, are both about 70km from Charlerois, in southern Belgium. Charlerois is where Marc Dutroux lived. Dutroux, who still hasn't come to trial, is accused of the abduction of six young girls, and the murder of four of them. Two of the children, just eight years old, were kept locked in a small cell in Dutroux's basement, where eventually they starved to death while their captor was in prison for four months. After the police arrested Dutroux, they discovered two other abducted girls, aged 12 and 14, still alive in the home-made dungeon. 'They were held in a white-painted concrete \"cave\" measuring 2m by 3m,' Time reported. 'The cell was cleverly concealed by sliding doors behind a basement cabinet.' </p> <p>There is an uncanny correspondence between this description of Dutroux's terrifying 'dungeon' and the dark, dank room that Gregor Schneider will be installing at the Royal Academy. It is the cellar of his own plain house in Rheydt, a suburb of Monchengladbach, hacked out stone by stone and removed bodily to London. </p> <p>The atmosphere of ominousness and dread that the two spaces have in common may be coincidental, but it isn't accidental. Although he is still only 31, Schneider has an interest in murder and what he calls 'places charged with a strong past event, but from which the event itself is absent' which dates back many years. His work, according to Rosenthal, 'exists in a space between the normal and the pathological'. The 'guest room' of Schneider's house in Rheydt has no windows and is clad with sheets of sound-proofing and lead covering. (Luc Tuymans has coincidentally done a set of paintings called Sealed Rooms . Mike Kelley has incorporated crawl spaces into several works.) Elsewhere in the house, walls have been built in front of walls, ceilings under ceilings, windows in front of windows. The 'coffee room' rotates 360 imperceptibly on its own axis: leaving by the door they arrived through, visitors risk stepping into a void. The house is riddled with the crawl spaces and deep shafts that Schneider has been excavating and modifying and concealing since he was 16. </p> <p>As a schoolboy, he obsessively photographed a place in the woods where a female art student had been murdered. He has been interested to discover 'whether a scream would stay behind in a room after you had left it'. Under the floor, there is a birdcage, dead animals, inflatable dolls. 'I'd love to stop someone getting away one time,' Schneider has said, 'but I have never dared to yet. I'm one of those people who live double lives and go out into the park at night and sift through the litter bins and secretly take something home with me_ I assume that there are others working at it and I will probably never meet the best ones.' </p> <p>The interesting thing is that both Tuymans and Schneider had been set on their paths for many years before the national trauma of Dutroux. For his last show in New York, it was naturally assumed that Tuymans was alluding to the paedophile scandal that had wracked his country, and to the occasion of the White March in Brussels, when 300,000 took to the streets to protest against the official incompetence and corruption that had made the system rotten. It was natural to assume it, but it wasn't necessarily the case. </p> <p>'Until that point,' Tuymans says, 'everyone looked at Belgium as being a small country in which people are a bit stupid but like to eat well. We've always been very good at keeping ourselves to ourselves. Mentally, so to speak. So with Andr\u00e9 Cools [a politician assassinated nine years ago] and then Dutroux, this whole perception changed. We came to be seen as what we are - a very corrupted society, to a point exceedingly sinister. The aim now, in art as elsewhere, it seems to me, should be to examine not what is unconscious, but what is conscious.' </p> <p>The mass demonstrations in Belgium happened in 1996. A year later, they were re-enacted in microcosm in London when relatives of child murder victims and MAMA (Mothers Against Murder and Aggression) descended on Burlington House in Piccadilly to plead with people queueing for the Sensation show not to enter because it featured a billboard-sized portrait of Myra Hindley by Marcus Harvey. Shortly afterwards, two men vandalised the picture. The Mirror featured the damaged painting in full colour on its front page accompanied by the caption: 'Exhibited by the Royal Academy in the so-called name of art, defaced by the people in the name of common decency'. </p> <p> Myra , like everything else in Sensation, was owned by Charles Saatchi. Saatchi's position as the most powerful collector of this kind of art in Europe is unassailable. It is precisely his status as a 'powermongrel' which makes Luc Tuymans disinclined to sell to him. 'The grip he holds has molested a lot of possibilities,' Tuymans says. 'In the past 10 years, Charles Saatchi has stripped the art of its political content.' </p> <p>Tuymans' work would be drowned out in the Saatchi Collection (as it might well be in the bombast of Apocalypse). It doesn't make a lot of noise. Like an inhabitant of Schneider's lead-lined room, the paintings fester inside their own repelling, chilly aura. They remind me of something Italo Calvino wrote just before he died: 'Knowledge of the world means dissolving the solidity of the world_ Were I to choose an auspicious image for the new millennium, [it would be] the sudden agile leap of the poet-philosopher who raises himself above the weight of the world, showing that with all his gravity he has the secret of lightness, and that what many consider to be the vitality of the times - noisy, aggressive, revving and roaring - belongs to the realm of death, like a cemetery for rusty old cars.' * </p> <p> Apocalypse: Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art runs from 23 September to 15 December at the Royal Academy of Arts, Burlington House, Piccadilly, London W1 (020 7300 8000; <a href=\"http://www.royalacademy.org  \" target=\"_NEW\">www.royalacademy.org </a></p>",
  "<p> You knew Winona Ryder had made it when she appeared on The Simpsons , way back in 1994, the year she became the first lady of slacker culture in Reality Bites . Unlike other hallowed Simpsons guest stars such as Mel Brooks, Elizabeth Taylor and Paul McCartney she didn't appear as herself - Ryder took the same route as Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathleen Turner and Glenn Close and played a one-off character. In the episode entitled 'Lisa's Rival', she provided the voice for gifted student Allison Taylor, put up a year at Springfield Elementary because she was 'getting bored with first grade'. She challenges Lisa's saxophone supremacy and almost wins the school's diorama contest with an elaborate scene from Poe's The Telltale Heart . </p> <p>It's tempting to trace a link between the precocious, talented, slightly gothic Allison and the precocious, talented, slightly gothic Winona, though in reality she was kicked out of high school for being a 'distraction', felt isolated from her classmates and was partly educated at home by hippie parents. After years of winning Hollywood's diorama contests - feted by critics, adored by fans, most importantly respected by the industry - Ryder, still only 28, is currently going through something of a losing patch. And we're not just talking about breaking up with Matt Damon. Nicholas Hytner, who directed her at her peak in Arthur Miller's The Crucible , commented at the time thatRyder 'has a good career because she never worries about her career'. Perhaps she should start. </p> <p>This autumn sees two poor Ryder films in succession. Lost Souls is her first proper horror flick - if you discount Francis Coppola's opulent Dracula , which was more of a period piece - and it promises to be a disaster, having been in a holding pattern for a whole year now. New Line planned to release it in the US in October 1999, but yanked it for fear of clashing with End Of Days and Stigmata , which had a similar pre-millennial religious theme. Pencilled in for a February release, it was pulled again - this time running scared of Scream 3 . Presumably New Line were extra-wary after the way their previous Rosemary's Baby rip-off, The Astronaut's Wife , had nosedived. </p> <p> Lost Souls , also starring Ben Chaplin and John Hurt, is now slated for an October release here and in the States - a second coming, if you will - although it has been erroneously trailered over there with a cap tion advertising its 'Fall 1999' release. Oops. The runes are not good, especially when a screening spy on the Ain't It Cool News website has already posted the pithy review: 'The movie is bad; the ending is worse.' </p> <p>Ryder's other seasonal turkey is Autumn In New York , a soppy love story with Richard Gere that may, due to the specifics of its title, take some time to reach these shores (it isn't even scheduled at present). Gere, playing the ageing playboy who falls in love with Ryder's terminally ill designer, railed against MGM's suicidal decision not to screen the film to US critics before release, although he stuck to the party line which was that 'the studio felt that it was important not to reveal plot points'. Right. </p> <p> Autumn In New York actually did okay business in its first week - thanks to what we're told was a 70 per cent female turnout - but word of mouth sent its takings down by half in week two. </p> <p>Those who elevated Ryder to the status of Hollywood's avenging angel in the early Nineties and pinned on her the hopes of Gen-X takeover must be wondering what happened to their once-hopeful indie darling. 'The actress of her generation,' they called her; a cross between the two Hepburns, Katharine and Audrey. In the 1994 update of David Thomson's Biographical Dictionary Of Film , he granted Ryder an entry, having handpicked her from a list of 'beautiful young women who might make it' (including Bridget Fonda, Nicole Kidman and Uma Thurman). 'I'm gambling on Winona Ryder,' he wrote, 'for no other reason than the feeling that she's been extraordinary already a few times.' </p> <p>It was a safe enough bet. Ryder had indeed been extraordinary 'a few times' in 1994 - and twice Oscar nominated, for Little Women and The Age Of Innocence . Perfectly cast as the goth teen in Tim Burton's Beetlejuice and as the murderous, pallid outsider in Heathers , she also excelled as Jerry Lee Lewis's junior bride in Great Balls Of Fire and gave a surprisingly naturalistic turn in Edward Scissorhands (Burton again) amid the hyper-real cartoonery. Still to come when Thomson put his money on the table was The Crucible , with Ryder at her career-best as vengeful Abigail, charged with the same crime as Ryder at high school: being a witch. </p> <p>But if all looked well on screen, it masked an emotionally unsettled time at home. By all accounts a delicate soul ('I blow over when it's windy,' she said), Ryder had started going out with Depp after Edward Scissorhands . She was only 18 at the time. Depp had 'WINONA FOREVER' tattooed on his arm to mark their engagement, and the couple became the Brad and Jennifer of their day. </p> <p>But the crown prince and princess of indie were not long to reign over us. They parted in 1993, and Depp had his tattoo rather humorously 'edited' by laser surgery to read 'WINO FOREVER'. It hit Ryder hard. Unable to sleep, she took to driving around in the middle of the night. One story has her chancing upon a newsstand and seeing herself on a glossy magazine cover under the headline, 'Winona Ryder: The Luckiest Girl in the World.' </p> <p>This discrepancy between public perception and private pain is not unique in Hollywood. The romantic merry-go-round which fuels the gossip sheets may keep us all entertained, but in reality it leaves a lot of people rattling around an empty house, emotionally speaking. After Depp - who moved on to another slip of a girl, Kate Moss - Ryder took up with dreadlocked rock singer Dave Pirner of grungers-by-association Soul Asy lum (ironically, around this time she started to 'get into' classical music). This relationship ended in 1997, and she went against her own beatnik stereotype by seeing Hollywood's new golden boy Matt Damon (not the tattooed type). They also became engaged, but the relationship stalled in March this year, and Ryder has since been linked with another rock star eccentric, Beck. Her upbringing on a California commune and the fact that acid guru Timothy Leary was her godfather seem to have some bearing on the type of man she chooses. </p> <p>The question is, does Ryder have any interest in being some 'It' girl whose social couplings are eagerly reported in supermarket tabloids, or is she in this for the acting? Since her awkward attempt at playing the quasi-action hero in Alien Resurrection , craft seems to have taken a second place to sensation. Excursions into horror ( Lost Souls ) and Disease Of The Week territory ( Autumn In New York ) merely confirm that the actress has lost her way somewhat since turning 25. </p> <p> A ray of hope for Winona lovers came this year with Girl, Interrupted , which Empire magazine described as 'Charlie's Angels Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest'. The thinking person's 'teen flick', it was based on Susanne Kaysen's memoir of her spell in a mental institution for which Ryder bought the rights in 1993, eventually taking it to the screen as first-time producer (she even picked the director: Heavy and Copland 's James Mangold). Ryder had booked herself into a psychiatric hospital aged 19 after pulling out of The Godfather III because of nervous exhaustion, so Girl, Interrupted was personal for her. It did reasonable business (around $28 million at home), but her thunder was well and truly stolen by more conventionally glamorous co-star Angelina Jolie, who won an Oscar. </p> <p>So where next for Ryder? She vowed she would never direct, but then she said the same about producing. In truth, there has always been more to her than meets the eye. She's a natural blonde for a start, and yet her raven hair is her trademark. She is a slight 5ft 4 - one interviewer commented: 'Everything, her wrists, her ears, her feet, is in miniature, as though the shrinking process she underwent in Beetlejuice has not quite worn off' - and yet she still wields power in Hollywood, and when a girl who'd beaten her up in school turned up for an autograph she told her: 'Go fuck yourself.' </p> <p>Ryder doesn't fit in, and this is the very reason we loved her in the first place. Her defiant refusal to do nude scenes is just one of the reasons she towers above the likes of Angelina Jolie. She is odd and honest and self-effacing (she described herself as a 'wet noodle' after the Godfather III incident) - which is why her potential slide into schlock is so alarming. Perhaps, like her Simpsons character, she's just 'bored with the first grade' and wants to skip ahead to being a safe thirtysomething. </p> <p>In accordance with her godfather Leary's famous words, we must hope that Ryder tunes in and turns on, rather than drops out. </p> <p>\u0095 Lost Souls opens on 3 November </p> <p><strong>Success, interrupted,,,</strong></p> <p><strong> Heathers (1989)</strong> </p> <p>Eighteen-year-old Ryder finds her niche as outsider Veronica at Westerberg High.

  "<p>Bill Gates's photographic business venture, Corbis, sparked anger among photojournalists gathered for the industry's annual festival last week in the French town of Perpignan. They were anxious about the fate of photographers working for two famous agencies bought by the company. </p> <p>News photographers working for Sygma and Saba - most of whom had verbal contracts under which the agenciestook 50 per cent and shared costs - complain that new Corbis contracts are geared more to the concerns of commercial photographers accustomed to seeing their images digitally altered - anathema in news pictures. </p> <p>Corbis, meanwhile, argues that the world of photojournalism has been changed radically by the digital revolution and that photographers are using Corbis as a whipping boy over more generalised fears about the future.Certainly the old model of independent agencies representing a limited number of photographers is fast disappearing, just as film is being replaced by digital disks. </p> <p>Agencies are being snapped up by larger corporations, notably the American group Getty Images, Hachette Filipacchi Medias of France - which this month bought the UK agencies Katz and IPG - and, most controversially, Corbis. </p> <p>Technological changes now offer faster, cheaper distribution and the promise of countless new outlets. Corbis, founded by Gates in 1990 to investigate the marriage of technology and photography, started buying old photo archives (Bill loves history), then moved on to news agencies. Within the last year Corbis bought both Sygma and the work of its 125 photographers and Saba, another high-profile independent agency. </p> <p>But quickly there was friction over the Corbis way of doing business (sell as many images as possible to as many outlets as possible), which sat badly with the creative desires of the news photographers. </p> <p>Sygma's Paris-based photographers, abetted by rigorous French laws on authors' rights, are expected to sign a rewritten contract soon. Photographers elsewhere are still waiting for a new deal. </p> <p>Steve Davis, Corbis's chief executive officer and president, says the company has a long-term plan for the industry, 'a real belief that if you could give photographers the opportunity to shoot in different ways, and you can give the marketplace a one-stop shop, that would benefit both sides'. </p> <p>However, the company's position, and its sponsorship of Visa Pour L'Image, the Perpignan festival, was undermined by the defection of several senior staff in the run-up to the festival and the resignation of several well- known photographers. Davis, in an interview at Perpignan, agreed that Corbis had made mistakes: 'There are some very unhappy clients and customers and photographers.' But he argued that Corbis is the 'flashpoint' for complaints simply because change is in the air. </p> <p>The digital revolution has transformed the work of the news photographer. It requires huge investment in new technology, and few agencies could afford to make the change without an injection of capital - which is why Marc Grosset, the widely admired owner of Rapho, has just sold to Hachette and its stable of magazines, including Paris-Match . </p> <p>However, Magnum, the famous co-operative, has rejected overtures from Corbis and Getty because of losing control over the use of images. The agency plans to finance digital operations by reducing sales percentages to members. </p> <p>Corbis, which reportedly lost $50 million last year, saw the possibility of selling to new markets and of combining different kinds of photography under one brand. Even news magazines need stock images (any decent picture of, say, Prozac), and would rather receive one invoice than several hundred. The Corbis website offers millions of images to anyone prepared to pay. But news photographers retain strong feelings for their pictures and want to retain control of the images - in effect to know they are going to a good home. </p> <p>The most successful news photographers might, under the old system, make $10,000 a month - relatively little compared to the rewards of fashion or advertising work. But photographers who are willing to spend weeks or months in a war zone, among famine victims in Africa or documenting nuclear refuse in Russia are not motivated solely by money, but by a desire to tell the story. </p> <p>Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Leroy, director of the Perpignan festival, says the present crisis mirrors those at the end of the Second World War and the 1960s, which saw the creation of Rapho, Sygma, Gamma and other agencies. </p> <p>The difference this time, 'is that nobody knows how tomorrow's agency will work. We have this huge revolution with the internet and digital photography, but I'm not sure we've found a way to use it.'</p>",
  "<p>The truck roared past, leaving a trail of dust billowing up into the palm trees. In its wake lay a tiny brown speck - a kitten, not more than a few weeks old. I ran over, picked it up and placed it out of the heat of the midday sun. What were we to do? The road was deserted and even though it was unhurt I didn't give much for its chances without its mother's protection. 'Come on, it's coming with us,' said my wife. </p> <p>'But we're going to the beach,' I protested. 'Cats don't sit on the beach.' </p> <p>'We'll talk to Sunshine,' she said. 'He'll know what to do.' </p> <p>So, with the kitten purring in my wife's handbag, we turned off the road and made for the beach and Sunshine's Bar. </p> <p>We were heading for Pinneys, the finest stretch of sand on the tiny Caribbean island of Nevis (pronounced 'neevis'). God had a good day when he created this beach, fringing its four miles with coconut palms, sprinkling it with golden sand and speckling its warm waters with pelicans. </p> <p>Sunshine, dreadlocks swinging to the reggae beat of his sound system, greeted us in his friendly, laconic manner. </p> <p>'What have you got there?' he asked, as the kitten popped its head out of the handbag and mewed. 'A cat. I could use a cat. I've got mice at home. Tell me,' he asked, as though these things are subject to the vagaries of fashion, 'what do cats eat nowadays?' </p> <p>We assured him that the fish and lobster on his menu would suit very nicely and so the kitten, hastily named Nisbet by my wife on the path down to the beach, found a new home. (Fanny Nisbet married the young Horatio Nelson on Nevis in 1787; Nisbet seemed a suitably neutral name, kitten sexing not being our forte). </p> <p>It only occurred to me later that Nevis might have been a better name. The image of a helpless kitten is a metaphor for the Caribbean islands; lost amid the vastness of the oceans, subject to the vagaries of cruel nature, entirely at the mercy of mankind, yet undeniably beautiful. </p> <p>Nature has dealt out more than a fair share of cruelty to the Caribbean in the past 10 years. Hurricanes are a way of life here, but there has been an increase in their frequency and ferocity and Nevis, like other islands, has suffered. Traditionally, the great storms come from the Atlantic, roaring over the sparsely populated and bleaker eastern shoreline, but last year was different. Hurricane Lenny screamed in from the Caribbean, swooping down on the western shore, piling up the sand on Pinneys beach and, crucially, smashing up the Four Seasons hotel, the largest and most prestigious venue on the island. As soon as word hit the US that the Four Seasons had been wrecked, Nevis was effectively written off as a tourist destination, so Lenny was a double disaster for its 10,000 inhabitants; their homes were damaged and their income cut. </p> <p>Except, of course, Nevis hadn't closed for business. Its other hotels were quickly back, particularly the plantation inns. The sugar planters of the eighteenth century knew a thing or two about the weather and were careful to plant up and away from the shoreline, so the Hermitage, Montpelier and Golden Rock plantations weren't bothered by Lenny. </p> <p>It is these graceful, elegant buildings that hold the key to today's Caribbean. For nearly 200 years they relied totally on slaves to tend their crops, and most of the Nevisian population descended from the Africans who were forced here in a triangular trade that saw sugar sent to England, manufactured goods to Africa and slaves to the Caribbean. When, in 1834, emancipation came, 7,225 slaves were freed, an event that is still celebrated here on the first Monday in August. Black people had the same rights as whites and every freed slave acquired a new surname. Most chose to take their previous masters', which gives rise to some startling names today. </p> <p>Tyrone O'Flaherty is Permanent Secretary for Tourism. He is in no doubt where the future for Nevis lies. 'We cater for the upper end of the tourist trade - the highly discriminating tourist. We won't have casino tourism here,' he said, in the cool of his air-conditioned office. The night before I had heard rumours of a second Four Seasons-style hotel being planned. He waved these suggestions away with talk of approaches from several companies, surveys and environmental considerations, but he did not dismiss the idea entirely, which will alarm some of the plantation inn owners, who see another big hotel (Four Seasons has 196 rooms) as a threat to their business and to the infrastructure on this 36-square-mile island. </p> <p>And what about the fish farm rumour? Nevis, with neighbouring St Kitts, is the western hemisphere's smallest nation state and as such has a vote at the UN, a vote the Norwegians and Japanese would value on the Whaling Commission. I had heard that the Norwegians had come with the not altogether altruistic offer to build a fish farm on the island. What on earth, I asked O'Flaherty, did an island surrounded with thousands of miles of ocean, need with a fish farm? Nothing had been decided, I was assured. Somehow it's difficult to imagine why anyone should wish to get involved in politics in such idyllic surroundings, but when people's livelihoods depend on the natural beauty and temperate climate of a tiny island everything becomes political. </p> <p>Opposition spokesman Hastings Daniel was refreshingly direct. He would have no truck with a fish farm. He would want a power station. </p> <p>The moon spread a carpet of silver over the dark Caribbean as we settled on the terrace at Golden Rock inn to hear the Honeybees, Nevis's oldest-established band. Its locally-made instruments include a fife, banjo, quako (four-stringed guitar), steel drum and an instrument called a baho, which used to be a hollowed out tree trunk until someone discovered that a length of plastic down-pipe serves just as well. </p> <p>Over dinner Pam Barry, who runs Golden Rock, explained that the former plantation cookhouse used to belong to her grandfather who was island doctor (as Fanny Nisbet's first husband had been a century before him). She had grown to love the island and its people in the 30 years she had been there, but was tired of four-legged litter louts. The sugar plantations used donkeys for transport and now the island had hundreds of their unemployed descendants wandering untethered, tearing open rubbish bags and scattering the contents along the roadside. Strangely, they are particularly active on a Saturday night. </p> <p>Everyone seems to have an opinion on the 'donkey problem' but no one appears to have a solution. When a cull was suggested, large numbers of overseas Nevisians put a stop to it, protesting - at a distance - at the destruction of their heritage. </p> <p>Much more entertaining than the donkeys, however, are the green vervet monkeys that live on the slopes of Mount Nevis. From the windows of our cottage in the grounds of the Hermitage we would see whole families come tumbling down to steal mangoes in the early morning, while on our balcony a bright yellow banaquit honeycreeper was vainly trying to build a nest in a lantern. </p> <p>Irridescent humming birds, great brown pelicans, beautiful frigate birds; Nevis seems blessed with birdlife, most of it happy to come within a few feet of the pool or beach, so that Peter Evans's Birds of the Eastern Caribbean became as much a part of our reading as our holiday fiction. </p> <p>While Nevis and the other Caribbean islands have long been independent they retain a colonial air, felt most strongly in the plantation inns. The Hermitage dates from 1740 and is the oldest wooden house still in use in the Caribbean (Nelson would have known it). Tea and cakes are served every afternoon; drinks before dinner have a club atmosphere. We found the same at Montpelier and Golden Rock; discreet charm, a sense of history, a sense of occasion. </p> <p>By contrast the Mount Nevis Hotel and Beach Club is a modern development, commanding stunning views across the sound to St Kitts. It must have one of the finest vistas from a swimming pool anywhere in the world, but to call it a Beach Club is a little misleading; the beach is a 10-minute drive from the hotel. Still, the standard of the expensive cuisine more than makes up for any disappointment. </p> <p> One morning we set out to climb up into the rainforest around Mount Nevis with Lynell, a tall, charismatic Nevisian who kept up a constant commentary on the flora and fauna while explaining life on the island. Like a lot of young Nevisians he left to work in the US and has returned to give something back to his homeland. He voiced a lot of the frustrations felt by his contemporaries. 'My green employment card in the US said I was a resident alien. I'm not an alien. That's for UFOs. This is a breadfruit tree planted here at Golden Rock by Captain Bligh; the wood of this white cedar makes excellent cricket bats. When I was a kid we couldn't afford cricket bats. We would play with the thick, hardened part of the coconut palm leaf and with a ball made from a crushed milk can covered with a tyre inner-tube; be careful of that one, ma'am, that's the stinking weed. Made into a tea it stops bed wetting. That's not to be confused with stinging nettle tea - that induces labour. </p> <p>'Now don't stand under these big coconut palms. A falling coconut is very dangerous. Kids nowadays don't know how to climb these things. Do you know that 2,000 Nevisians are living abroad at the moment? That's a brain drain. We need those people back here.' Now, he should go into politics. </p> <p>We were struck by how silent it was as we climbed higher. 'Ten years of hurricanes have made the forest quiet,' said Lynell, pointing out the trumpet tree, whose leaves turn white when a hurricane is approaching - a natural early-warning system. The pathway narrowed and we clung to branches to prevent ourselves tumbling down the steep mountainside, but it was never dangerous. Not that everyone would agree. 'Sylvester Stallone booked to come on this walk the last time he was staying at Four Seasons,' said Lynell. 'But he cancelled when it rained.'

  "<p><strong>Three Kings</strong> (1999, 15, Warner, VHS/Rental, DVD/Retail)<br>David O. Russell, independent writer-producer of quirky low-budget movies, advances into big-budget mainstream cinema with this astonishing action movie starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Spike Jonze and Ice Cube as an odd quartet of US soldiers pursuing a cache of Kuwaiti bullion in the wake of the 1991 Operation Desert Storm. It's a knowing movie, full of surreal detail, confronting the madness of modern warfare.</p> <p><strong>Being John Malkovich</strong> (1999, 15, Warner, VHS/Rental, DVD/Retail)<br>Writer-director Spike Jonze's breathtakingly inventive comedy takes Andy Warhol's '15 minutes of fame' theory to its absurd conclusion by inviting New Yorkers to pay to enter the mind of actor Malkovich. The movie is a work of wayward genius that soars into space from the troubled life of dedicated Manhattan puppeteer John Cusack, and confidently evokes Lewis Carroll and Franz Kafka. </p> <p><strong>Magnolia</strong> (1999, 18, Entertainment, VHS/Rental)<br>Paul Thomas Anderson's third movie is one of those social microcosm dramas in the manner of Joyce's Ulysses and Altman's Short Cuts. Over a single day (and 188 minutes running time) the paths of more than a dozen disparate denizens of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley intersect, most of them connected in some way with a bed-ridden tycoon (Jason Robards) or a quiz show host (Philip Baker Hall). All human life is here in this valley of the shadow of death, ranging from Tom Cruise's charismatic sex guru to William H. Macy's former child star. The people are miserable, but Anderson's film is not, and it ends with a spectacular biblical storm that Cecil B DeMille would have envied.</p> <p><strong>Tumbleweeds</strong> (1999, 18, Entertaiment, VHS/Rental)<br>In a typical example of the rite of passage relocation movie, the thrice-married, much abused Mary Jo (Janet McTeer) quits her latest drunken lover in a West Virginia trailer part and takes her aggressive sharp-tongued 12-year-old daughter Ava (named for Ava Gardner) to find a new life in California. It's familiar material, but well observed, and the tough, vulnerable McTeer richly deserved her Oscar nomination.</p> <p><strong>The Way Ahead</strong> (1944, U, VHS/Retail)<br>Carol Reed's truthful wartime feature film - scripted by Major Eric Ambler and Private Peter Ustinov - began as a 20-minute Army instructional picture. It follows a group of British soldiers from conscription to their first taste of battle in North Africa. A peerless cast includes David Niven (platoon commander), William Hartnell (tough sergeant, a role he repeated in Carry on Sergeant) and Stanley Holloway. This was the army equivalent of In Which We Serve and The Way to the Stars.</p>",
  "Wearing a public mien of calm, on Monday 21 December, Peter Mandelson went down to Greenwich for an inspection tour of the Millennium Dome, which was soon interrupted by urgent instructions to talk to Downing Street. Back at No 10, Derry Irvine and Charlie Falconer, the lawyers of the Blair court, were brought into the discussions with Campbell about how to try to control the loan story. At this meeting, Jonathan Powell produced a note from Sir Richard Wilson. After talking to the DTI's Permanent Secretary Sir Michael Scholar, the Cabinet Secretary confirmed that Mandelson had been properly insulated from the DTI inquiries into Robinson. But both the civil servants also took the view - which Wilson conveyed to Blair - that for Mandelson to be so hugely and secretly indebted to the Paymaster-General was nevertheless 'a very big problem'. <p>On Monday afternoon, the Guardian formally approached Mandelson and Robinson for confirmation of the details of the loan. Into the placidity of the Christmas recess, a period usually devoid of big political events, the bomb detonated.</p> <p>A strangely unperturbed Mandelson convinced himself he could walk through the fire. Blair was instinctively and immediately doubtful that he could possibly survive what he and Campbell both knew would be an inferno. The press secretary briefed political correspondents that the Prime Minister did not regard it as 'a hanging offence', which fell far short of a ringing statement of confidence.</p> <p>For the next 24 hours, beginning with Monday's Newsnight, on which he declared, 'There is no conflict of interest so the question of resignation does not arise', Mandelson toured the TV and radio studios, determined to tough it out. As he told one friend: 'I've learnt from my personal life that you have to stand up to these fuckers. If they scent blood, they will come for the kill.'</p> <p>But the more Mandelson talked, the more questions were raised. Should he have declared the loan in the Register of Members' Interests? Had he revealed the loan to the Britannia Building Society when he applied for a mortgage? After a period of equivocation, Mandelson confessed that he had not. Wegg-Prosser was alerted to this deadly question on Monday night during a conversation with Piers Morgan, the editor of the Mirror. Mandelson's own aide concluded then that his master could not survive. 'Peter's finished,' Wegg-Prosser told one of Blair's aides. 'It's the size of it,' was Blair's private verdict to aides and officials about why the loan was so devastating. For the price of Mandelson's house in an elite enclave of west London could be bought a street of homes in his constituency of Hartlepool.</p> <p>Blair's initial prognosis that Mandelson was not to be saved was hardening by Tuesday morning into a certainty that he had to be severed. Alastair Campbell, thinking the media would never let go until Mandelson resigned, and Anji Hunter, protective of Blair's reputation, were both urging the Prime Minister to dispatch the Trade and Industry Secretary. Blair turned to another confidant for advice. He rang Philip Gould, who was spending Christmas in Jamaica. As warm as the weather was in the Caribbean, Blair's chilly fury transmitted itself down the line. 'Why aren't you here when I need you?' Blair snapped. Gould, while registering Blair's shock and anger, attempted to offer pleas in mitigation. After everything Mandelson had done to create New Labour, should he have his five-month career in the Cabinet terminated? 'You should hold on to Peter. You shouldn't give in to our enemies,' Gould argued. 'If you let Peter go, you'll be weakened.' Blair perceived that, but he saw himself and the Government being more damaged by letting Mandelson hang on. In response to Gould's entreaties to save Mandelson, Blair was stony: 'Look. Read the papers, Philip. Think again.' The phone went down.</p> <p>Blair had retired to Chequers when, at 10 on the night of Tuesday 22 December, he talked again to the man whose skills once so mesmerised him. Blair was not good at breaking bad news. He particularly did not relish telling a friend as old and as close as Mandelson that he wanted him gone. He allowed the other man to lead the conversation, asking for his own assessment. Mandelson still believed himself to be the victim of a 'stitch-up' by the Brownites. The press were 'completely hysterical' and 'out of control'. He had made a mistake, he was prepared to admit that now. Yet he clung to the belief that he could and must remain in the Cabinet.</p> <p>Mandelson did float the idea that he might have to resign. By describing this as 'very painful', he evidently hoped that Blair would respond by dismissing the idea. The words that would have been music for him were the Prime Minister saying that he wasn't going to sacrifice him under pressure from the media, and that the No 10 propaganda organ would be pumped to save him. How Blair replied was therefore a crushing disappointment. He told Mandelson that they should 'sleep on it'. Such an expert reader of the codes of political conversation grasped what Blair was semaphoring. The Prime Minister and those advising him wanted to see the following morning's newspapers before they made a final decision.</p> <p>The press was savage, though not unanimously so. The Guardian, the paper that broke the story, pronounced him guilty of 'more vanity than venality' and judged that resignation would be a sentence out of proportion to the crime. The Sun, which Mandelson once so assiduously courted, had gone down on him. The tabloid shrieked: 'So How The Hell Can Mandy Stay?' There were ironies to be savoured. Among the people whom Mandelson had cultivated was Elisabeth Murdoch, daughter of the man who owned the Sun.</p> <p>Even now, a large percentage of Mandelson believed he could yet save his place in the Cabinet. At seven on Wednesday morning he phoned Wegg-Prosser to tell him to organise a 'fight-back' meeting at the DTI with Campbell, his deputy, Lance Price, and Jonathan Powell. Mandelson also talked twice to Gordon Brown. It is an example of the weird convolutions of their relationship that Mandelson turned to the man whom he suspected to have played a large role in precipitating the most traumatic moment of his career. In their first conversation, Brown expressed the view that he should apologise but not resign. Guilt may have been speaking. Mandelson would later come to the conclusion that, while Brown intended to damage, the Chancellor did not expect to destroy him. Anxiety was also informing Brown's reaction. He had reason to fear that, if Mandelson went, all the heat would concentrate on whether he and his coterie had connived to demolish a fellow Minister to the detriment of the Government. An exiled Mandelson would thirst for revenge. When he spoke to Brown for a second time that morning, the Chancellor sombrely rated Mandelson's survival prospects to be much more occluded. By now, Brown had spoken to Blair and discovered how conclusively determined the Prime Minister was to sack Mandelson.</p> <p>The fight-back meeting never happened. At shortly after 10am, Campbell and the others from No 10 arrived in Mandelson's ministerial suite in the DTI tower with its panoramic view of Westminster Abbey. Almost immediately, Campbell ordered everyone else out of the room and into the next door Private Office so that Mandelson could be put through to Blair.</p> <p>Blair was now explicit. The longer Mandelson tried to cling on, the more Mandelson and the Government would be damaged. Mandelson repeatedly asked Blair if that was really his opinion, in an effort to seek out a chink of weakness. That was his view, Blair flatly confirmed, offering the consolation that the quicker he left the Cabinet, the better chance there would be of a reasonably rapid return. By the end of the conversation, tears were trickling down Mandelson's sepulchral white cheeks. A dark-eyed Campbell, himself blubbing, gave Mandelson a hug.</p> <p>Recovering from this lachrymose moment with professional speed, Campbell then wrote a resignation letter for Mandelson and a reply for Blair. Campbell took his compositions to Wegg-Prosser to type up. The wretched Mandelson signed Campbell's draft virtually unaltered, though he first faxed it over to Gordon Brown for him to see. He wanted the Chancellor to taste some of the grief that had been inflicted on him. Blair faxed back Campbell's draft of the Prime Minister's reply with some added personal touches.</p> <p>The Chancellor spread the word among his entourage that their enemy had fallen. Ed Balls and his wife, Yvette Cooper, were on the road, driving to spend Christmas with parents. At precisely the moment that Gordon Brown rang his mobile, Ed and Yvette realised they had forgotten the turkey they were providing for the family Christmas. 'He's gone,' announced Brown. 'We've got to turn back,' Balls said to his wife. 'No, you don't understand. There's no turning back,' said Brown. 'He's resigning at 11 o'clock.' </p> <p>The announcement actually came slightly later, just before the lunchtime news bulletins. Soon after, Robinson was gone as well. Mandelson's resignation missive began: 'I can scarcely believe I am writing this letter...', which was scarcely surprising to those who knew that it had been composed by Alastair Campbell.</p> <p>The swiftness of his departure, and the manner in which it had been dressed up in the resignation letter ghosted by Campbell, succeeded in creating the impression that he had honourably withdrawn to spare the Government prolonged torture at the hands of its opponents. Denis MacShane, the Labour MP for Rotherham, voiced a widely believed platitude: 'Nothing became Peter's holding of high office as the manner of his leaving.' The notion that this was a graceful, selfless sacrifice was deceptive. Peter Mandelson did not fall on his sword. Tony Blair gently, firmly, ruthlessly and necessarily thrust Mandelson on to the blade.</p> <p>Blair's fury was accompanied by a sense of loss. He saw the gaping tear left in the Cabinet. Mandelson had been a Blairite before Blair. He was one of the few who could be called believers in New Labour from more than convenience or sycophancy. There was also the worry for Blair of what a wretchedly depressed Mandelson might do.</p> <p>At around noon on the day of the resignation, the Prime Minister asked Mandelson to Chequers, a characteristically kindly, but also calculating, gesture. It is a sign of the froideur between them that Cherie initiated the call. 'You will always be part of the family,' she told Mandelson. Only when his wife had broken the ice did Blair himself come on the line to say: 'We want you to be with us.' Mandelson and his partner, Reinaldo Avila Da Silva, joined the Blairs' family supper and spent the night. Mandelson was now contrite. 'I know I've done a terrible thing,' he confessed to Blair. 'I've hurt you and I've hurt the Government.' Blair had written out some advice about how to work his passage back: sell the house, get around the constituencies, be a team player. 'For God's sake,' he said to Mandelson. 'Make some friends in the Labour Party.'</p> <p>An ocean of bad blood had been spilt. To the poisonous feud between Brown and Mandelson, and the destabilising rivalry of Blair and Brown, there had now been added a twist to the relationship between Blair and Mandelson. Blair could never again invest quite the same level of trust in Mandelson's judgment.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/focus/story/0,6903,369245,00.html\">Extract four: How Kosovo strained Blair's 'special relationship'</a></p>",
  "<p>We love Jamie Oliver for lots of reasons; his technical ability as a cook is not one of them. Sure, we love his minimalist flat and his tousled hair. We adore his matiness and his 'so laid back I'm horizontal' style. The obsession with good ingredients is cool, too - the way he flits from market to boutique bakery to pukka fishmongers and back again, squeezing and sniffing and fondling the produce as he goes. And yes we do, of course, love the food (or at least, I do). But that's not because we think he might be Escoffier's love child. On the contrary. The whole Jamie Oliver brand has been marketed on exactly the opposite, a throw-it-together approach which, as he himself puts it in the credits, strips down recipes to their bare ingredients. </p> <p>So it's kind of weird that his first restaurant venture since he was indecently assaulted by fame - the dining room at a club in Chelsea called Monte's - should be such a poncey one. The ponce factor lies not just in the food, which, in places, is exceptionally un-Jamie, but in pricing, too. I doubt whether many of those mates of his who crowd into his living room at the end of each programme to eat his grub could afford to come here regularly or, given the location, whether they would want to. </p> <p>I had visited Monte's once before, for a works party held in the basement nightclub. On that occasion it struck me as the kind of place where gentlemen would go to sniff substances off the thighs of ladies whose services come at an hourly rate. </p> <p>The restaurant is in a rather more sombre second-floor room dressed in brooding shades of chocolate and devoid of art, save for a peculiar black and white photo of John Lennon. The only flash of colour comes from the bright cover on copies of Jamie's latest book, stacked up on the windowsill. The windows beyond those stacks overlook Sloane Street from whence most of the clientele seemed to come. You know the type: scarves by Herm\u00e8s, shoes by Manolo Blahnik, cosmetic surgery by Harley Street. </p> <p>His books may have been there, but Jamie himself was not. While he did man the stoves in the open-plan kitchen during the first few days, he is here merely as a consultant. The only obvious Jamie thumbprint lies in the occasional burst of incongruous menu language. Mixed-grilled breads are described, for example, as 'tasty' (as against what? Tasteless?); bruschetta is served with 'a lug of good olive oil' (as against bad olive oil?). That aside, the food seems generally more complex than anything we'd expect from the lad. </p> <p>I started with fritto misto of Scottish girolles (\u00a38.50), which was a hell of a lot more than just wild mushrooms: there was borage, Swiss chard, sage, anchovies and capers, all expertly cooked in a batter so light as to make even an accomplished home cook whimper with envy. The only duff note was the inclusion of a sweetbread which remained a pulsating, grey gland beneath its crisp coating. Louise, the magazine queen, chose grilled langoustine for her starter (\u00a314.50). The sharp-clawed creatures themselves were admirable, but the advertised basil and lemon mayonnaise was a bit of a dud. I mistook it for a caper mayonnaise before looking it up on the menu, so unsteady was the flavouring. </p> <p>It was Louise's main course of ravioli stuffed with courgettes, ricotta, mint and pecorino (\u00a312) which really gave the lie to any suggestion that this was the cooking of that Jamie off the telly: the dish was made with a seriously delicate and unctuous pasta. It was excellent. My spicy fish broth of red mullet with squid, clams, mussels, crabmeat dumplings and coriander (\u00a314) was a ballsy fish stew with a real depth of flavour and generous lumps of fish. The only dish that came close to delivering the kind of thing you'd expect of a restaurant selling itself on the Jamie connection was the pudding we shared - a pear and almond tarte tatin (\u00a36) with lovely chewy lumps of caramel and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. </p> <p>I suspect this all reads as though I'm criticising Monte's for being too good, but that's not it. My beef is the gap between the marketing of the product and the product itself. If Jamie Oliver really does believe in his 'Naked' brand, he ought not be servicing the ladies who lunch (so to speak). He should be running somewhere urban and funky, serving up simple, modern food at reasonable prices. He should, in short, be doing what John Torode has done in his restaurant at Smith's of Smithfield, London. Because our bill for two, with three glasses of a modest Sauvignon, came to \u00a390 including the pre-added 'discretionary' service charge. And that's an awful lot to pay for the Jamie Oliver experience. </p> <p> Monte's, 164 Sloane Street, London SW1 (020 7245 0892). Lunch for two, including wine and service, about \u00a390.

  "<p>Regular readers of this column will be familiar with my references to our Jewel garden. This has been an experiment that my wife Sarah and I have been trying to follow for the past couple of years. The idea is to plant up an area of 40m by 20m with plants whose flowers and foliage are either richly coloured within the broad parameters of emerald, amethyst, ruby, and sapphire, or have a distinctly metallic hue, reflecting gold, silver, copper or bronze. </p> <p>I know I have written about this quite a bit over the last couple of years, but I am learning more from this project than almost anything else in the garden over the past 10 years. The experiment needs constant alteration and amendment. It isn't perfect and will never be so but, other than the days when it is ravishingly beautiful, it adds meaning to the heart of a garden that would otherwise merely be pretty. </p> <p>It is also an eye-opener to see how clear parameters can expand the creative process. Most of us do this indoors - with a colour scheme, for example - without batting an eyelid, but rarely carry the process on outside with anything like the same rigour. I think scale is the key. Big things like sky, trees and lawns, swamp and dilute all but the most confident attempts at colour themes. </p> <p>I think it's best to keep the area small enough to stick strictly to the limitations that define the space. That sounds a bit fierce, but the secret of any themed area of the garden is both to keep to that theme and to push it to the very limits. Every extra square metre of ground makes that task harder, as everything you plant slightly alters everything that is planted. Mathematically expressed, it means that for every extra square foot of planted area you have to take into account the extra cubic visual effect. </p> <p>Having said that, we have a whopping great area that we are trying to interweave with the precision and subtelty of needlepoint. Of course this means failure on a regular basis. The urge to let the reds slide into pink is constant and it hurts to remove the flowers of exquisite opium poppies that have seeded themselves and are just too pale a shade of purple. </p> <p>One of the main factors is the importance of the metallic colours. Gold, silver and bronze/copper foliage and flowers supplement green as links between the other colours, as well as having a role in their own right. Over the next three weeks I am going to see how these metallic colours have worked for us so far, starting with gold. </p> <p>The first question is when is gold not gold, but yellow? This matters because yellow - real, unarguable yellow - looks completely wrong. So most of the wonderful, luminous lime greens and acid yellows of spring - think of Euphorbia polychroma or Echaracias subsp. wulfenii in April - are not appropriate. Generally, spring yellows tend to be paler than the ones at this time of year, so golden flowers are thin on the ground until midsummer. There are a number of golden crocuses, and the species tulip Tulipa sylvestris counts as golden for me, as does 'Golden Apeldoorn'. The wallflower Erysimum x kewense 'Harpur Crewe' is also a good gold. </p> <p>Later in the year it simply becomes a matter of trial and error. All the buttercup/ egg-yolk-yellow flowers are perfect, from marigolds (with the amazing Calendula 'Indian Prince' as deep as gold will go before it becomes orange), the Californian poppy Eschscholzia californica (which, within its own variations, is as near as any flower gets to true gold) Lysimachia punctata, heleniums, sunflowers, Achillea filipendulina 'Gold Plate', the imperial fritillary, to the Ligularia przewalskii, L dentata 'Desdemona' and 'The Rocket' - although we only get away by having the ligularias in the borders due to our heavy, very moisture-retentive soil. The North American daisy rudbeckia is another border plant that secretly pines for a nice, soggy bog. Their daisy flower-heads have golden petals around curiously cone-shaped black centres. As long as the soil is wet, they are improved by being in full sun. </p> <p>I see that Nori and Sandra Pope, in their book Colour by Design (\u00a325, Conran Octopus) suggest golden chard, another plant that likes rich soil, which I was previously unaware of as a separate variety. I grow rainbow chard, which includes wonderful golden stems among the pinks and oranges but apparently can be selected out as a predictable golden contribution. We shall grow it in the Jewel garden next year. We also grow the hot Crocosmias, such as 'Lucifer' and 'Firebird', but species crocosmia x crocosmiiflora has rich, golden flowers and is very good. </p> <p>We started out with the pale-yellow potentillas, self-seeded rocket, variegated comfrey, Thalictrums and variegated sages but, after a year or so, realised that the pale gentleness simply does not work. It is false gold. You might think plant names would be a pretty foolproof guide and that 'Aureum' would be as good as gold. Not so. Bowles' golden grass ( Milium effusum 'Aureum') was too yellow and had to be taken out. Golden hop, Humulus lupus 'Aureus' is dodgy in spring, but it comes good later in the year, so can be forgiven for a month of what my American friends call 'chartroose'. </p> <p>Golden foliage is more constant through the growing season and therefore vital. Our rich soil suits hostas and some of them, if grown in full sun, are a good golden colour. Suitable varieties lurk beneath crassly suggestive names: there's Hosta 'Fragrant Gold', H 'Midas Touch' and H 'Golden Medallion' (for those brasher, shirt-open-to-the-navel moments). For a more elevated golden colour we planted a couple of Robinias ( Robinia pseudoacacia Frisia). I shall be planting a Cornus kousa chinensis this autumn, because it has a wonderful golden colour developing in the leaves in late summer. We also have a couple of hollies including 'Golden Queen', which has a golden margin. Despite its name, it is male and therefore produces no berries, whereas the other one, JC van Tol, has green leaves but produces yellow berries. </p> <p>Grasses are a significant contributor of gold to this bit of the garden. The wonderful waving wands of the giant stipas are molten gold in the evening sun and if you look at any summer meadow it is actually hardly green at all - more fawn. (How come fawn is suddenly allowed, whereas a decent yellow is summarily ejected? It is all to do with light. Trust me.) Calamgrostis x acutiflora turns from an orangey brown to gold with the light behind it, and Carex elata 'Aurea' has enough gold only to need sun to enhance its golden tones. We grow the bamboo Phyllostachys aureosulcata varaureocaulis , whose golden stems gleam through the plants before it. And Miscanthus nepalensis produces gold plumes like delicate strands of thread. It is a good one. * </p> <p><strong> Observer reader offer</strong> </p> <p> Readers can order a Crocosmia Collection, for \u00a36.99 including p&amp;p., which consists of 10 'Lucifer' bulbs and 10 'Firebird' bulbs.

Stephen Barber's biographical travelogue reveals a tale of two cities - New York and Paris - and inveterate island-hopping. Paris, White's domicile from 1983 until recently, accorded with his sense of transgression, artistic and otherwise, and it was here he met his lover, Hubert Surin, who was later to die of Aids. </p> <p>According to Marina Warner, White wrote so expressively about sex because he'd had so much himself. Barber understandably focuses on the corporeal, but writing of White is somewhat akin to trying to strip a nude.

For others, however, the play will remain the thing. </p> <p> <strong> Veronika Decides to Die</strong><br>Paulo Coelho<br>HarperCollins \u00a36.99, pp191<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502452182,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> </p> <p> Only John Grisham sells more books than Paulo Coelho. As a teenager, Coelho was institutionalised three times by his parents for wanting to be an artist. The same fate befalls Eduard, a supporting character in the Brazilian's latest spiritual muesli. Veronika, young, with much to live for yet determinedly nihilistic, wakes from her suicide attempt in a Slovenian asylum to be told that the damage her heart sustained means that she has only five days to live. </p> <p>Naturally, this terminal sentence awakens a freedom and vitality hitherto lacking, and impels a resuscitative sense of carpe diem. Coelho's sixth self-help novella is literally fabulous. Desiccated yet somehow spacious, his writing ripples the surfaces of identity, madness and mysticism, with a nod to Carlos Castaneda and Borges, and a wink to Camus. </p> <p> <strong> Society Within</strong><br>Courttia Newland<br>Abacus \u00a36.99, pp310<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502265900,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> </p> <p>Society Within is the second volume of 27-year-old Courttia Newland's uncompromising trilogy set on the barely-fictional west London council estate of Greenside. The follow-up to the soon-to-be-filmed The Scholar, it continues to splice authentic black London street slang and West Indian patois into well-paced narrative, with deeper grooves and more female perspective than its predecessor. </p> <p>Newland guides us through a gritty struggle of urban deprivation, crack-fuelled rape, teenage sex, rejected novels and failed pirate radio stations. It may sound bleak, but Newland's loosely interlaced episodic storylines, centred on estate newcomer Elisha, cussedly celebrate a survivalist ethic with unblinking panache, as befits the first writer to be sponsored by Nike. </p> <p>An impressively mature post-Trainspotting book about teenagers (and dedicated to one, Stephen Lawrence), yet on no account prescriptively for them.

  "<p><strong>Eclipse </strong><br>John Banville<br>Picador \u00a315.99, pp214<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502156824,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> For three decades, John Banville has been refining the exquisite, mandarin style that is his hallmark, and establishing himself as the finest writer of the confessional narrative since Nabokov. While he has moved around within time - he wrote an enduring historical triptych about Kepler, Copernicus and Newton - his mode of delivery has hardly changed during his career. </p> <p>Certain colours - silver, gold, blue - dominate his descriptive palette; certain types of characters recur - the shambling, brutish, self-deceiving male narrator, the big-haunched, strident female; certain obsessions condition the texture of the prose - the solidity of light, for instance, and its ability to fall geometrically as rhomboids, panes or columns. Critics of Banville insinuate that though he plays it expertly, he has only got one tune. </p> <p>Banville clearly doesn't listen to them, however, because his new novel Eclipse is, if anything, an intensifying of his characteristic mannerisms. It consists of a monologue delivered by Alexander Cleave, a celebrated actor whose career is ended at its apex when he corpses on-stage in a production of Euripides's Heracles. </p> <p>Anxious to escape the limelight of dishonour, Cleave returns to live alone in his dilapidated childhood home. There, he hopes, he will be able to work out who he really is. By scrutinising his past, he will be able to peel back the onion layers of identity accumulated in a lifetime of acting and discover the bare nub of his self. And that is just about all that happens in the book. Cleave wanders dreamily about the corridors and rooms of his house, remembering scenes and people from his past and trying to puzzle out how he got to where he is. </p> <p>Events from reality do intrude into his reveries; a circus comes to town, a malodorous caretaker named Quirke and his feral, 15-year-old daughter, Lily, move into the house; Cleave's wife, Lydia, arrives in a flurry of bangles and cigarette smoke. </p> <p>But these real-time happenings are held at a curious distance - we only witness them through Cleave's digressive prose. Even when something terrible and momentous does finally occur, Cleave's instinctive response is to reimagine it as a theatrical scene: 'Tragedy always has its anonymous messengers; in sandals and robe they run in fleet-footed from the wings and fall to one knee before the throne, heads bowed, leaning on the caduceus.</p> <p>Eclipse is Banville's boldest book to date precisely because there is so little plot to it. The Untouchable (1997) fictionalised the life of Anthony Blunt, Poussin expert and most fastidious of the four famous Cambridge spies; it contained within it the narrative drive of known history. </p> <p>Here, however, there is nothing at all to distract from the language - the novel is a carefully made display-case for Banville's burnished prose. Fortunately, it stands up to scrutiny. He has a scrupulous eye for visual detail - a shaving cut dabbed at with tissue is 'a white floweret with a tiny rust-red heart'; pond-skimmers' feet make 'pewtery dents' on the surface of a pond - but also a fondness for splendid, elaborate images; a word or idea in a sentence can suddenly fling open the door on to an unexpected antechamber of metaphor: 'It is late, the light is going. I see what was my life adrift behind me, going smaller and smaller with distance, like a city on an ice floe caught in a current, its twinkling lights, its palaces and spires and slums, all miraculously intact, all hopelessly beyond reach.' </p> <p>That The Untouchable, a magnificent novel, didn't even make it onto the Booker Prize shortlist was a disgrace to the prize. It might have been of some comfort to Banville, who has not yet won the Booker, that the opening 20 lines of The Untouchable were set as a passage for analysis in the following year's Cambridge English finals, alongside extracts from Defoe, Dickens, Ruskin, Churchill and several other garlanded giants of English prose, a canonisation of sorts for a man from County Wexford. </p> <p>In Eclipse, Banville has created another important, challenging fiction. The book is ornately written, heartless in an honest fashion, profoundly interrogative of ideas of identity and, above all, spectacularly beautiful. It is, in ways that so many contemporary novels are not, a work of art.</p>",
  "Wearing a public mien of calm, on Monday 21 December, Peter Mandelson went down to Greenwich for an inspection tour of the Millennium Dome, which was soon interrupted by urgent instructions to talk to Downing Street. Back at No 10, Derry Irvine and Charlie Falconer, the lawyers of the Blair court, were brought into the discussions with Campbell about how to try to control the loan story. At this meeting, Jonathan Powell produced a note from Sir Richard Wilson. After talking to the DTI's Permanent Secretary Sir Michael Scholar, the Cabinet Secretary confirmed that Mandelson had been properly insulated from the DTI inquiries into Robinson. But both the civil servants also took the view - which Wilson conveyed to Blair - that for Mandelson to be so hugely and secretly indebted to the Paymaster-General was nevertheless 'a very big problem'. <p>On Monday afternoon, the Guardian formally approached Mandelson and Robinson for confirmation of the details of the loan. Into the placidity of the Christmas recess, a period usually devoid of big political events, the bomb detonated.</p> <p>A strangely unperturbed Mandelson convinced himself he could walk through the fire. Blair was instinctively and immediately doubtful that he could possibly survive what he and Campbell both knew would be an inferno. The press secretary briefed political correspondents that the Prime Minister did not regard it as 'a hanging offence', which fell far short of a ringing statement of confidence.</p> <p>For the next 24 hours, beginning with Monday's Newsnight, on which he declared, 'There is no conflict of interest so the question of resignation does not arise', Mandelson toured the TV and radio studios, determined to tough it out. As he told one friend: 'I've learnt from my personal life that you have to stand up to these fuckers. If they scent blood, they will come for the kill.'</p> <p>But the more Mandelson talked, the more questions were raised. Should he have declared the loan in the Register of Members' Interests? Had he revealed the loan to the Britannia Building Society when he applied for a mortgage? After a period of equivocation, Mandelson confessed that he had not. Wegg-Prosser was alerted to this deadly question on Monday night during a conversation with Piers Morgan, the editor of the Mirror. Mandelson's own aide concluded then that his master could not survive. 'Peter's finished,' Wegg-Prosser told one of Blair's aides. 'It's the size of it,' was Blair's private verdict to aides and officials about why the loan was so devastating. For the price of Mandelson's house in an elite enclave of west London could be bought a street of homes in his constituency of Hartlepool.</p> <p>Blair's initial prognosis that Mandelson was not to be saved was hardening by Tuesday morning into a certainty that he had to be severed. Alastair Campbell, thinking the media would never let go until Mandelson resigned, and Anji Hunter, protective of Blair's reputation, were both urging the Prime Minister to dispatch the Trade and Industry Secretary. Blair turned to another confidant for advice. He rang Philip Gould, who was spending Christmas in Jamaica. As warm as the weather was in the Caribbean, Blair's chilly fury transmitted itself down the line. 'Why aren't you here when I need you?' Blair snapped. Gould, while registering Blair's shock and anger, attempted to offer pleas in mitigation. After everything Mandelson had done to create New Labour, should he have his five-month career in the Cabinet terminated? 'You should hold on to Peter. You shouldn't give in to our enemies,' Gould argued. 'If you let Peter go, you'll be weakened.' Blair perceived that, but he saw himself and the Government being more damaged by letting Mandelson hang on. In response to Gould's entreaties to save Mandelson, Blair was stony: 'Look. Read the papers, Philip. Think again.' The phone went down.</p> <p>Blair had retired to Chequers when, at 10 on the night of Tuesday 22 December, he talked again to the man whose skills once so mesmerised him. Blair was not good at breaking bad news. He particularly did not relish telling a friend as old and as close as Mandelson that he wanted him gone. He allowed the other man to lead the conversation, asking for his own assessment. Mandelson still believed himself to be the victim of a 'stitch-up' by the Brownites. The press were 'completely hysterical' and 'out of control'. He had made a mistake, he was prepared to admit that now. Yet he clung to the belief that he could and must remain in the Cabinet.</p> <p>Mandelson did float the idea that he might have to resign. By describing this as 'very painful', he evidently hoped that Blair would respond by dismissing the idea. The words that would have been music for him were the Prime Minister saying that he wasn't going to sacrifice him under pressure from the media, and that the No 10 propaganda organ would be pumped to save him. How Blair replied was therefore a crushing disappointment. He told Mandelson that they should 'sleep on it'. Such an expert reader of the codes of political conversation grasped what Blair was semaphoring. The Prime Minister and those advising him wanted to see the following morning's newspapers before they made a final decision.</p> <p>The press was savage, though not unanimously so. The Guardian, the paper that broke the story, pronounced him guilty of 'more vanity than venality' and judged that resignation would be a sentence out of proportion to the crime. The Sun, which Mandelson once so assiduously courted, had gone down on him. The tabloid shrieked: 'So How The Hell Can Mandy Stay?' There were ironies to be savoured. Among the people whom Mandelson had cultivated was Elisabeth Murdoch, daughter of the man who owned the Sun.</p> <p>Even now, a large percentage of Mandelson believed he could yet save his place in the Cabinet. At seven on Wednesday morning he phoned Wegg-Prosser to tell him to organise a 'fight-back' meeting at the DTI with Campbell, his deputy, Lance Price, and Jonathan Powell. Mandelson also talked twice to Gordon Brown. It is an example of the weird convolutions of their relationship that Mandelson turned to the man whom he suspected to have played a large role in precipitating the most traumatic moment of his career. In their first conversation, Brown expressed the view that he should apologise but not resign. Guilt may have been speaking. Mandelson would later come to the conclusion that, while Brown intended to damage, the Chancellor did not expect to destroy him. Anxiety was also informing Brown's reaction. He had reason to fear that, if Mandelson went, all the heat would concentrate on whether he and his coterie had connived to demolish a fellow Minister to the detriment of the Government. An exiled Mandelson would thirst for revenge. When he spoke to Brown for a second time that morning, the Chancellor sombrely rated Mandelson's survival prospects to be much more occluded. By now, Brown had spoken to Blair and discovered how conclusively determined the Prime Minister was to sack Mandelson.</p> <p>The fight-back meeting never happened. At shortly after 10am, Campbell and the others from No 10 arrived in Mandelson's ministerial suite in the DTI tower with its panoramic view of Westminster Abbey. Almost immediately, Campbell ordered everyone else out of the room and into the next door Private Office so that Mandelson could be put through to Blair.</p> <p>Blair was now explicit. The longer Mandelson tried to cling on, the more Mandelson and the Government would be damaged. Mandelson repeatedly asked Blair if that was really his opinion, in an effort to seek out a chink of weakness. That was his view, Blair flatly confirmed, offering the consolation that the quicker he left the Cabinet, the better chance there would be of a reasonably rapid return. By the end of the conversation, tears were trickling down Mandelson's sepulchral white cheeks. A dark-eyed Campbell, himself blubbing, gave Mandelson a hug.</p> <p>Recovering from this lachrymose moment with professional speed, Campbell then wrote a resignation letter for Mandelson and a reply for Blair. Campbell took his compositions to Wegg-Prosser to type up. The wretched Mandelson signed Campbell's draft virtually unaltered, though he first faxed it over to Gordon Brown for him to see. He wanted the Chancellor to taste some of the grief that had been inflicted on him. Blair faxed back Campbell's draft of the Prime Minister's reply with some added personal touches.</p> <p>The Chancellor spread the word among his entourage that their enemy had fallen. Ed Balls and his wife, Yvette Cooper, were on the road, driving to spend Christmas with parents. At precisely the moment that Gordon Brown rang his mobile, Ed and Yvette realised they had forgotten the turkey they were providing for the family Christmas. 'He's gone,' announced Brown. 'We've got to turn back,' Balls said to his wife. 'No, you don't understand. There's no turning back,' said Brown. 'He's resigning at 11 o'clock.' </p> <p>The announcement actually came slightly later, just before the lunchtime news bulletins. Soon after, Robinson was gone as well. Mandelson's resignation missive began: 'I can scarcely believe I am writing this letter...', which was scarcely surprising to those who knew that it had been composed by Alastair Campbell.</p> <p>The swiftness of his departure, and the manner in which it had been dressed up in the resignation letter ghosted by Campbell, succeeded in creating the impression that he had honourably withdrawn to spare the Government prolonged torture at the hands of its opponents. Denis MacShane, the Labour MP for Rotherham, voiced a widely believed platitude: 'Nothing became Peter's holding of high office as the manner of his leaving.' The notion that this was a graceful, selfless sacrifice was deceptive. Peter Mandelson did not fall on his sword. Tony Blair gently, firmly, ruthlessly and necessarily thrust Mandelson on to the blade.</p> <p>Blair's fury was accompanied by a sense of loss. He saw the gaping tear left in the Cabinet. Mandelson had been a Blairite before Blair. He was one of the few who could be called believers in New Labour from more than convenience or sycophancy. There was also the worry for Blair of what a wretchedly depressed Mandelson might do.</p> <p>At around noon on the day of the resignation, the Prime Minister asked Mandelson to Chequers, a characteristically kindly, but also calculating, gesture. It is a sign of the froideur between them that Cherie initiated the call. 'You will always be part of the family,' she told Mandelson. Only when his wife had broken the ice did Blair himself come on the line to say: 'We want you to be with us.' Mandelson and his partner, Reinaldo Avila Da Silva, joined the Blairs' family supper and spent the night. Mandelson was now contrite. 'I know I've done a terrible thing,' he confessed to Blair. 'I've hurt you and I've hurt the Government.' Blair had written out some advice about how to work his passage back: sell the house, get around the constituencies, be a team player. 'For God's sake,' he said to Mandelson. 'Make some friends in the Labour Party.'</p> <p>An ocean of bad blood had been spilt. To the poisonous feud between Brown and Mandelson, and the destabilising rivalry of Blair and Brown, there had now been added a twist to the relationship between Blair and Mandelson. Blair could never again invest quite the same level of trust in Mandelson's judgment.</p> <p> \u00a9 2000 Andrew Rawnsley. </p> <p>Extracted from Servants of the People by Andrew Rawnsley, to be published by Hamish Hamilton on 25 September at \u00a317.99.</p> <p>To order this book for \u00a314.99 plus 99p p&amp;p, call Observer Culture Shop on 0800 3168 171</p>"
