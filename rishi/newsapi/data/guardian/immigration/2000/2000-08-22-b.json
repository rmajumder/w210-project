  "<p>The sky is blue, the sun has come out at last, but from inside a sweltering office, the rays can seem malevolent. This is August, the month of holidays and, for those stuck in the office, the month of resentment. </p> <p>If it's pouring with rain, we curse the typical British summer; if the sun shines, we curse the fact that we can't get out to enjoy it. If the workload takes a dramatic nosedive, we curse again because the days become interminably long - but even worse is when one employee ends up buckling under the weight of three people's jobs and coping with crises that normally go unnoticed because someone else deals with them. </p> <p>But August in the office doesn't have to be depressing. Cristina Odone has been moved up a notch from her job as deputy editor of the New Statesman to acting editor while the editor, Peter Wilby, follows the politicians into summer recess. She says she has discovered all sorts of unexpected pleasures in being office-bound while all around are not. While she admits \"there are climactic difficulties associated with working through August and a little bit of martyrdom when everyone else is away\", her solution is to take long, lingering breaks in the middle of the day. \"A three-hour lunch is a good antidote,\" she suggests. </p> <p>She believes getting the opportunity to stretch yourself beyond your job description is something everyone should have a shot at. \"I'm enjoying proving to Peter that I can do it without him. For 11 months of the year the buck stops with him, but suddenly it's stopping with me. Instead of him leaving the office at midnight on deadline day, I'm doing that, so there's a sense of complicity with him. I understand much better what his job involves and it's nice to know I'm capable of it.\" </p> <p>But in case Wilby is reading this, she assures him no coup is planned. \"While in the abstract I suppose August is the month in which employees can plot a takeover while the boss is out of the way, I'm not sure that works in practice. To pull off such a coup you need to be able to show off to proprietors or board members. But they'll probably be away sunning themselves under coconut palms, too, and there's not much point putting on a show in the office if you're playing to an audience of one.\" </p> <p>One of the biggest joys of August is undoubtedly the under-crowded commute. It is the only time of the year when it's possible to sit on the bus or tube and fling open a newspaper without shoving your elbow into the mouth of the unfortunate soul squashed up next to you. And the office environment becomes almost benign with no queues for the coffee machine and more oxygen per person. </p> <p>Ben Williams, a chartered corporate psychologist, believes these temporarily spacious arrangements have a positive impact on workplace performance. \"When too many people are crowded together, you get a behavioural sink. People feel they can get away with more because there are too many people around for them to be closely observed. When experiments were carried out cramming rats into a confined space, a rise in delinquency was noted among them. When there are fewer people and everyone is more closely observed, they take more responsibility for their actions.\" </p> <p>Perhaps one of the most salutary lessons about August work patterns is that while the pace is slower, things still get done. John Hildebrand, of the City firm Investec Asset Management, says: \"Everything is so much more relaxed in August. Dress codes are easier, with more chinos than pinstripes, and people are more likely to go for a drink after work, but things still happen. Traditionally the financial markets are weaker in August and there's a feeling that nothing's going on. But actually big mergers and takeovers don't always stop during the summer break - we've just had all the excitement with Barclays taking over the Woolwich.\" </p> <p>The public sector can have particular problems finding enough staff to cover frontline hospital and residential care home services in August - managers see this month as a \"mini-millennium\" in terms of juggling essential services with staff's desire to head off on holiday. </p> <p>Mike Boyle, project team leader for asylum seekers and refugees at the Local Government Association, has to deal with emergencies all year round. But he says that even though the numbers of asylum seekers don't reduce in August, he loves this month. \"It's great. The services for asylum seekers still get provided but all the Home Office officials I liaise with are away and I can catch up on reading and writing reports. Usually if I arrive at the office after a meeting, I'll have 40 emails and 15 phone messages waiting for me. When I get in today I'll be surprised if I have two phone messages and any emails.\" </p> <p>John Wilson, professor of occupational ergonomics at Nottingham University, believes August isn't quite what it used to be in terms of a slump in workload. \"I've noticed that more and more colleagues take their lap-tops and mobile phones away on holiday with them and send and receive emails on the beach.\" </p> <p>Even universities, which were once deserts during the summer, now buzz with life. \"The car park here used to empty in August,\" Wilson says, \"but at the moment it's almost full. Academics can't just go off to summer schools any more. The pressure on research is so great that they're all here. </p> <p>\"Everyone is in some sort of supply chain, whether they're in a service industry, health or education, so people have less to do to keep running round the hamster wheel.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, Wilson believes it is hard to know whether we are just doing too much wasteful work the rest of the year. \"There are certainly more internal audits and more managers than there were 15 years ago. Some say they don't improve services but things may well be worse without them.\" </p> <p>But Boyle is convinced that a more streamlined approach is the way to workplace salvation. \"The rest of the year, I end up coming into work before 9am and not leaving until 9pm. During August I arrive at a normal time and leave at a normal time. I think this is the only month in which we've got our working practices right. It's the other 11 months we've got real problems with.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is one of the ruling orthodoxies of the age that everyone not only can but wants to live independently: therefore institutions by definition are bad and oppressive. Yet every doctor is regularly confronted by patients who, through no fault of their own, need shelter from the harsh exigencies of modern daily life. The trouble is that there are no longer any institutions where they can be looked after with kindness and humanity. </p> <p>A Swedish study, published last week in the British Medical Journal, suggests that deinstitutionalisation might not have been so good for patients with schizophrenia. As the number of psychiatric in-patient beds in Stockholm declined, by 64% between 1976 and 1994, so the death rates of schizophrenics relative to the rest of the population increased equally dramatically. This was the case for natural causes and deaths by violence. </p> <p>One possible explanation for the increase in the relative risk of schizophrenics dying from cardiovascular disease and other natural causes is that as their admission to hospital has become less frequent, so contact with the medical profession has become more irregular. Practically all schizophrenics smoke; at large in what is called the community, but is actually an impersonal agglomeration of strangers, they adopt a lifestyle that is not conducive to good health. Then when they become sick, their very psychiatric condition inhibits them from seeking medical help. </p> <p>Relative to the rest of the population, schizophrenics in Stockholm are increasingly likely to die from suicide and \"unspecified violence\". For example, male schizophrenics first diagnosed between 1976 and 1980 were 13.2 times more likely to die by their own hand, and 12.1 times more likely to die of \"unspecified violence\", as their non-schizophrenic peers. The ratios for schizophrenics first diagnosed between 1991 and 1995 were 47.8 and 45.2 respectively. </p> <p>Of course, the study has to be interpreted with care. Numbers of deaths in the schizophrenics first diagnosed between 1991 and 1995, while relatively large, were small in absolute terms: therefore chance occurrences might have played a part in the production of so alarming an impression. </p> <p>Moreover, the paper in the BMJ does not allow us to determine whether the health of schizophrenics was improving or deteriorating in the absolute sense. It is possible for the health of schizophrenics to have deteriorated relative to that of non-schizophrenics, and yet to have improved absolutely. These figures could merely mean that the health of schizophrenics has not improved as far or as fast as that of the non-schizophrenic population. From the point of view of the individual, however, it is the absolute improvement or deterioration that is the more important. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the paper from Stockholm will increase the scepticism of those who believe that care in the community - that welcoming phrase again that seems to deliberately and dishonestly disguise the nature of the world that schizophrenics will actually be discharged into - has not been the success it has often been cracked up to be. </p> <p>In my experience, there are quite large numbers of people, not necessarily with psychiatric illnesses, who are more at home in institutions than floating free in an indifferent world outside. Oddly enough, I meet quite a number of them in prison: poor souls who actually prefer to be incarcerated, with three meals a day and no confusing choices to make, than at large in the wider world where everything they do is wrong. </p> <p>No one doubts that the old mental hospitals were in many ways appalling institutions: that the wards for patients were an impoverishing environment. But the old hospitals had advantages too. They really were asylums for those who needed asylum. To have concluded that they were not necessary because they were in many ways so bad, and that therefore their former residents should have been made to fend for themselves, was a bit like concluding that because our schools are so bad, children should be sent down the mines.</p>",
  "It has taken almost a year, involved thousands of hopeful children, and proved so contentious that a director and casting agent are alleged to have pulled out in protest during the multimillion-pound selection process. <p>But, yesterday, the tale of Warner Bros and the Search for Harry Potter was finally completed with the announcement that a relatively unknown British boy had been chosen ahead of a raft of Hollywood veterans to star in the much-hyped film about the best-selling boy wizard. </p> <p>Daniel Radcliffe, an 11-year-old whose childhood will change irreparably once the film is released a year next November, is already an actor, but has so far only appeared in last year's acclaimed BBC adaptation of David Copperfield. In it he played an almost-unbearably cute young David whose \"sensitive saucer eyes\" made an impact on at least one critic. </p> <p>An only child, he has wanted to act since the age of five. But his parents, a casting director and an agent, appear to have been reluctant to foist the kind of fame upon their son which has proved so detrimental to a catalogue of child stars, from Mark Lester to Macaulay Culkin, Tatum O'Neal to Drew Barrymore. Speaking at the time David Copperfield was launched, Daniel confided they had prevented him auditioning for ITV's Oliver Twist. </p> <p>\"My mum and dad never thought it was a very good idea,\" he said, adding that his mother had only eventually sent a Polaroid of him to the BBC \"because I've always acted since I was five\". </p> <p>Their decision to let him fulfill his early ambition will now see his adolescence dominated by Harry Potter. Although Warner Bros has just the first of JK Rowling's children's books, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, in the pipeline, it has the rights to all four published so far. Rowling, a one-time teacher whose books have sold more than 35m copies and who last year earned \u00a314.5m on the back of them, has said she plans to write seven novels about Harry and his chums at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. </p> <p><b> Adult cast</b><br> </p> <p> Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman are all said to have been signed up for the blockbuster adaptation, which will be partly filmed in Gloucester Cathedral. </p> <p>The role of Harry was more sought-after among Hollywood's child actors than even that of Anakin Skywalker in last year's Star Wars movie, The Phantom Menace. Those rumoured to have been lined up include Jake Lloyd, the nine-year-old who played Anakin; Liam Aiken, who played Susan Sarandon's son in Stepmom; and Haley Joel Osment, the Oscar-nominated 11-year-old star of The Sixth Sense who said recently: \"I'd love to play Harry. You can put the word out and I'll be working on my accent.\" </p> <p>The casting process - which looked at 40,000 applications after a single BBC Newsround appeal - was so lengthy, it apparently led the casting director, Susie Figgis, to pull out in frustration. The director Steven Spielberg reportedly withdrew after Rowling vetoed his plan to cast Haley Joel on the grounds that Harry should be British. </p> <p>Last night the film's director, Christopher Columbus, admitted: \"We saw so many enormously talented kids in the search for Harry. The process was intense and there were times when we felt we would never find an individual who embodied the complex spirit and depth of Harry Potter. Then, Dan walked into the room and we all knew we had found Harry.\" </p> <p><b> Unknowns</b><br> </p> <p> Columbus was equally effusive about Emma Watson, 10, and Rupert Grint, 11, the unknowns who have only appeared in school plays and were picked to play Harry's sidekicks, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. \"[They] are perfect for the roles of Hermione and Ron,\" he said. \"I couldn't be happier to begin work with such talented, inspiring young actors.\" </p> <p>Rowling - believed to have had strong control over the casting - also gave Harry her approval. \"Having seen Dan Radcliffe screen test,\" she said, \"I don't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry.\" </p> <p>But while the relief and excitement was palpable yesterday, there was strong awareness of the need to protect the children. Warner - which reportedly threatened to sack anyone who divulged Harry's identity before the announcement - delayed a press conference to unveil its proteges until tomorrow, and was last night refusing to reveal more information than was on its website. </p> <p>The industry is all too aware of the pressures of fame, which have seen so many child actors succumb to addictions of one kind or another. Last night one former child star, Jack Wild, who played the Artful Dodger in Oliver!, warned Daniel would need to \"not take anything seriously\" to avoid being drawn in by adulation. </p> <p>\"It's very difficult,\" he said. \"I was just a working class boy but I was a millionaire before I was 17. You begin to realise you're responsible for everyone's jobs around you, and you think you have power and control, which is very corrupting. You crave fame - but it comes at a very great price.\" </p> <p>But there was a less gloomy prognosis for Daniel's future from the director John Boorman, who recently directed him in the upcoming film of John Le Carre's novel The Tailor of Panama, in which he plays the son of the tailor alongside Geoffrey Rush and Jamie Lee Curtis. </p> <p>Describing him as \"a lovely kid\" he said: \"The most important thing when you're casting children is to make sure you cast the parents, and his parents are excellent people. They're aware of the pressures but they're also very protective, without being pushy. I like them very much.\" </p> <p> <b>Coping with fame, fortune and failure</b><br></p> <p> <b> Jack Wild</b> </p> <p>As the Artful Dodger in the 1968 film of Lionel Bart's musical Oliver!, Wild won fame at the age of 15 - and by 17 had a couple of million-dollar contracts and his own US TV show. But he also had the start of a drink probem that dogged him until his mid-30s. \"I was never really sober. I just topped myself up every day,\" he explained recently. \"There have been some low points, certainly.\" </p> <p>These included the breakdown of his marriage to his Welsh wife, Gaynor, and the decline in his career, which largely centres on pantos. After a period living at home with his father, Wild, 47, now lives with his actress girlfriend whom he met four years ago in Jack and the Beanstalk at Worthing. </p> <p><b> Drew Barrymore</b> </p> <p>Barrymore, now 25, was the epitome of cuteness when she starred at the age of six in Steven Spielberg's ET. But at seven she began pouring Baileys on her ice cream, by 10 she was partying on wine, beer and dope, and at 12 she was snorting six lines of cocaine a day. By 14, she had come out as an alcoholic, gone through rehab and attempted suicide; at 15, she had filed for \"legal emancipation\" from her mother; at 17, she had posed naked; and at 19 she married a Welsh bar owner. It lasted six weeks. </p> <p>Hers, however, is ultimately a success story, for in an astonishing turnaround she has become a darling of Hollywood once more. As she recently said: \"I didn't think I'd live past 25, but I've slowed down.\" </p> <p>Having reinvented herself as a winsome girl-next-door, she now commands $2.5m a movie following hits such as The Wedding Singer, Batman Forever and Scream. She also runs her own production company, Flower Films, and is filming the remake of Charlie's Angels with Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu. </p> <p><b> Mark Lester</b> </p> <p>Now 41, the star of the film Oliver! won fame at the age of 10. By 14, was earning \u00a3100,000 a year as he starred in an average of two films a year. </p> <p>But, as puberty beckoned, the roles dried up. There seemed little to do but spend his newly released money: on his 18th birthday he was handed \u00a370,000 and went wild. \"I bought myself a Ferrari and it was party, party, party,\" he has said. \"It was terrific fun at first. I tried everything that was going, drink, dope, acid - whatever was on offer. For a teenage boy, it was like a dream come true.\" </p> <p>But it soon turned sour: the \u00a370,000 took just two years to get through, and his three-year relationship disintegrated when his girlfriend tired of his dissolute lifestyle. </p> <p>It was a wake-up call. He ended up in rehab, began to keep fit, and, at 28, went back to school to gain the A levels required to study osteopathy. Now married with young children, he runs a successful osteopathy and acupuncture clinic in Cheltenham. </p> <p><b> Macaulay Culkin</b> </p> <p>At the age of nine, the star of Home Alone became the most successful child actor since Shirley Temple, garnering an estimated $40m (\u00a325m) fortune. </p> <p>But at 13, after a series of flops and his parents' custody battle, he refused to act again, instead dyeing his hair blue, spraying graffiti on his parents' apartment walls and playing truant. </p> <p>At 16, he took his parents - whom Hollywood insiders claim were living out their dreams through him - to court and wrested control of his fortune from them. </p> <p>At 17, he was married to fellow former child star Rachel Miner in what appeared to be a further fit of rebellion. It emerged last month that the couple have separated. </p> <p>He has hardly worked for the past six years. But he recently made a tentative move towards a badly needed comeback by auditioning to appear in a play in London's West End. </p> <p><b> Jodie Foster</b> </p> <p>Foster appears to be the exception that proves the rule. From the age of three she was starring in commercials and soon became the family's breadwinner. She has appeared in 33 films. Yet she insists that regular work, her education and her mother's constant support, protected her. \"It's not as if I was a child star,\" she has said. \"I was a child actress, which is something completely different.\" </p> <p>Now 37, and a single mother with a baby son, she has become the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, earning a reputed \u00a310m per movie and winning Oscars for The Accused and Silence of the Lambs. She is also a director but suggests motherhood is her greatest achievement. </p> <p> <b>Useful links: </b><br><a href=\"http://www.bloomsbury.com/harrypotter/\" target=\"_new\">Harry Potter (Bloomsbury - UK)</a> <br><a href=\" http://harrypotter.warnerbros.com/cmp/main-fr.html\" target=\"_NEW\"> Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Warner Bros)</a></p>",
  "<p>No sooner had Amores Perros won a prize at the Cannes film festival than the RSPCA rushed to attack its bloody scenes of dogfighting. Arguing that \"context is no defence\", the society declared: \"Anything which involves goading or cruelty to animals is unacceptable.\" </p> <p>That debate could now become more than academic. Following its British premiere at Edinburgh, Amores Perros (Love's a Bitch) is about to be picked up by a major UK distributor for release later this year. </p> <p>The film's director, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, insists he was scrupulous about not harming any animals during filming. Despite realistic-looking scenes in which dogs leap at each other, fangs apparently primed to bite, a lot was done in the shooting and editing - \"the same way I'd avoid hurting somebody in a car accident\". </p> <p>The dogs were wearing plastic muzzles - apparently clearly visible if you freeze-frame the film on video - while the ones that appear dead and bloodied were made up and drugged for 20 minutes at a time. The film's animal trainer is very respected in animal welfare circles, Gonzalez Inarritu says - \"and he used his own dogs, so he cared about them\". </p> <p>In Mexico, where the film has been a big hit, the press hardly commented on the animal cruelty question. There will certainly be more of a problem here. The British Board of Film Classification is rigorous about films that show or even suggest animal violence, saying: \"Baiting animals is a no-no as far as we are concerned, no matter how good the film is.\" </p> <p>While the subject matter could be a serious obstacle to British distribution, Gonzalez Inarritu is open to suggestions about cuts. \"If it was just frames, maybe. But if they wanted me to take out the dogfights, that would be impossible. They are part of the motion of the story and the characters.\" </p> <p>The movie is an intricately plotted portmanteau of three stories, linked by a car crash and told at car-crash speed. The first story has a group of poverty-level kids getting involved in the illicit and extremely violent dog-fighting scene; the second is a macabre Tale of the Unexpected about a supermodel, a luxury apartment and an ill-fated lapdog; and the third features an itinerant hitman who moves through different levels of city society, bringing all the strands together. </p> <p>Gonzalez Inarritu insists that context is very much a mitigating factor, and that the dogfighting theme is part of an overall panorama of life in his home town. \"I wanted to make a film about Mexico City, where there are millions of dogs. The dogfight is a cruel reality. But more than the fights, we were interested in the relations between dogs and people.\" </p> <p>He and his screenwriter, novelist Guillermo Arriaga Jordan, took on the city with Balzacian ambition, tackling it on various levels, from low-life to penthouse. \"Many Mexican directors,\" he says, \"are scared to shoot in Mexico City, which is why there are many stories in Mexican cinema about little rural towns, or set a hundred years ago. It's difficult to shoot there, not just technically but because it's such a complex mix. All the city's frontiers are falling - now you see rich districts where there are a lot of poor people.\" </p> <p>The three stories in Amores Perros are more or less true. The character El Chivo (The Goat) was based on a story that Arriaga had heard about a teacher who disappeared to join a guerrilla cell and was never seen again (in the film, he becomes a hitman). The story in which a model's lapdog is lost under her floorboards is also based on fact. \"But in real life it ended when they noticed a bad smell from under the floor.\" </p> <p>The film's intricately twisted structure has a ring of Pulp Fiction, but Gonzalez Inarritu isn't a big fan of Tarantino. \"I like the way he plays with structure - but I don't know why he gets the credit. It's really William Faulkner; it's a literary structure that has existed for a long time.\" And Gonzalez Inarritu insists he takes his violence very seriously. \"When you live in a city, as I do, where violence is really in the streets and people die every day, there's nothing funny about it. We try to show that violence has a consequence - when you create violence, it turns against you.\" </p> <p>Although Gonzalez Inarritu only attended two fights himself, he insists that his lurid vision of the dogfighting underworld is \"very, very accurate. Thirty per cent of the people in the movie are real people from the dogfighting world, and we used some real fighting dogs. It's shown the way they do it, in empty swimming pools and backlots. The people can be dangerous - there are drunk people, druggie people, violent people, and some of them take their children of four, five years old. But I don't judge them. For them it's like bullfighting or going fishing - for them it's natural, something you do on a Saturday.\" </p> <p>Gonzalez Inarritu admits he was afraid to handle the animals himself: \"These dogs are real motherfuckers.\" One animal used in the film was a security dog, trained to leap at a person's chest, and able to break ribs in the process. </p> <p>Gonzalez Inarritu came to film after a career as a radio DJ on Mexico's WFM rock station, where he had a daily show, \"telling stories to people, trying to keep them entertained for three hours. That was my training as a storyteller. You create stories with music, you create soundtracks for the lives of the people in the city - four million listeners every day.\" And four million stories in the naked city, no doubt. So far Gonzalez Inarritu has managed to tell three of them in one blast. Let's hope there are more to come. </p> <p>Amores Perros will be screened today at 8pm at Cameo 1, Edinburgh (0131-228 4141).</p>",
  "<p>A man in a white cowboy hat strides out of the heat haze on an empty desert road. Slow maraca heartbeat and the sound of cicadas. A bloated yellow snake slides across the screen as another cowboy in a black hat approaches. We've been here before. </p> <p>The stereotypes keep on coming: flouncing saloon girls and whisky-drunk hitchhikers; solitary gunplay in a motel room; the old Travis Bickle routine from Scorsese's Taxi Driver, itself a replay from all those gunslinger B-movies. \"You lookin' at me? Are you lookin' at me?\" The man with the gun knows the lines as well as we do. </p> <p>This is not a cowboy movie. This is not a road movie, despite the locale and the clothes and the soundtrack, with its cowpoke yodelling and Tex-Mex songs. \"We're not always undone by stereotypes - in some way they sustain us,\" Isaac Julien, director of The Long Road to Mazatlan, has remarked. This work, part of the exhibition Cinerama at Manchester's Cornerhouse Gallery, takes its title from a line in Tennessee Williams's Night of the Iguana, although Julien's film does no more than nod at Williams. </p> <p>It takes its cues more from Warhol's Lonesome Cowboys, ironic macho cowboy drag, and the male bodies swooning and plunging in David Hockney's painted pools. It is impossible to look at The Long Road to Mazatlan without recalling dozens of movies, dozens of novels. I think of the Border Trilogy of novels by Cormac McCarthy; Bob Hope and Bing Crosby on the road to nowhere; a whole jukebox full of familiar tunes. </p> <p>Julien is the writer and director of Young Soul Rebels (a tale of gay punks set in the Queen's jubilee year), Looking for Langston (about the 1920s Harlem Renaissance poet Langston Hughes) and Franz Fanon: Black Skin, White Mask (about the black psychiatrist and revolutionary). He has always been difficult to place. He is a film-maker, an artist, a theorist, a black Londoner who teaches at Harvard. His themes are black identity, history and culture, queer aesthetics and desire. His films and DVD installations are multi-layered, rich, poeticised, witty and sexy. He's an expert at the erotics of vision (in this case, the homoerotics). </p> <p>The Long Road to Mazatlan is a collaboration between 40-year-old Julien and Venezuelan-born choreographer and dancer Javier de Frutos. De Frutos also plays one of the work's two protagonists. The two men (for the first time in Julien's work, both the leading players are white) have an edgy attraction to one another, but the nearest we get to a coupling is a beautifully set mise-en-sc\u00e8ne in a garden swimming pool, and a moment or two in a motel room. The story, like their attraction, is never consummated. Which, it appears, is the whole point. The entire work is a kind of long deferral, a crossing and recrossing of roads and glances. </p> <p>This is clearly not a commercial movie or a straight story in any sense, much less a mere homage to Hollywood. Even so, it is haunted by the question of narrative and narrative conclusions, like many film and video works presented as art installations. Those artists who most successfully apply narrative structure - Iranian Shirin Neshat (currently at the Serpentine, and Fruitmarket, Edinburgh) and Finnish artist Eija-Liisa Ahtila - do so in the realisation that narrative thrust and drive are inevitably frustrated in the gallery, where the audience wanders in and out at will. We almost always enter at the wrong time, or feel that we do, and that the trajectory of whatever narrative there might be is always ahead of us, always somehow out of reach. Art film and video are almost inevitably forced to take a position close to the fractured approach of 20th-century avant- garde literature. They shuffle the pages, and present us with returns and reversals, repetitions, inversions, and breaks in the storyline. </p> <p>Julien has said of video art, disparagingly, that \"something had to replace painting\". And, like history and allegorical paintings, his films are reference-laden, spectacular presentations. They are screens on which things happen, places where the world is refracted and represented to us, foreshortened, condensed, cut down to size, yearned for and parodied. A place, then, where the fictional and the real meet. </p> <p>Vagabondia, Julien's second work here at the Cornerhouse (also made with De Frutos, who choreographed the dance sequences), turns film into a kind of place, and then invades it. A black female conservator, played by Cleo Sylvestre (who had a similar role in two previous Julien films, The Attendant and Three) wanders through London's Sir John Soane Museum, along with Soane himself, a second black woman in 18th-century garb, and a startling interloper, a lurching, dancing, crazed young man (the dancer Ben Ash), who might have stumbled in, gibbering and yelling, from William Beckford's gothic novel Vathek. </p> <p>Vagabondia seems to be all about the summoning of ghosts and the breaking of the obsessive, ultimately repressive order of Soane's maniacal collection. Julien uses a split screen, which doubles and reverses most of the action in a series of vertiginous reflections (an arresting technical effect, though sometimes a bit mechanical and wearisome). At some points we can no longer tell which is the true image, and what is apparition and reflection. </p> <p>Soane's house and the landscape of The Long Road to Mazatlan are both places of the imagination as much as they are exotic locations, caught in a kind of cinematic aspic. Julien is really good at pace, atmosphere, the conjunction of image and sound, the piquant shot. He knows how to grab us and keep us there, to keep us looking. His works have a kind of density and compaction and, in a sense, don't need storylines except as a way of keeping us looking. Almost every shot is entire, almost a novel in itself. </p> <p>Julien keeps us, as it were, suspended between beginnings and endings in a kind of perpetual present. Keeping us looking, and making us want to look again and again, concentrating and lapsing in and out of reverie as we do so, is a kind of erotic act, a seduction. But having seduced the viewer, he interrupts us, and turns the stereotypes on their head, swerves the story into a lesson about power and history and sex.

  "Mexico's beleaguered Institutional Revolutionary party has lost the election for governor in the southern state of Chiapas, six weeks after defeat in the presidential election signalled the end of its seven-decade monopoly of national government. <p>The defeat in Sunday's election came at the hands of Pablo Salazar, a charismatic maverick who trounced the PRI candidate, Sami David, to romp to victory at the head of the eight-party Alliance for Chiapas. With 71% of the votes counted yesterday, Mr Salazar had 54% and Mr David 45%. </p> <p>\"This day will be inscribed in our memory as the day the people of Chiapas decided to change our personal and collective destiny,\" Mr Salazar said in a victory speech that underlined his commitment to find a peaceful solution to the six-year Zapatista conflict over indigenous rights. </p> <p>\"Go on and cry, go on and cry,\" his supporters chanted as they flooded into the streets of the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez, to revel in the failure of the PRI's legendary party machine to deliver in its first major test since Vicente Fox of the National Action party (PAN) won the presidency on July 2. </p> <p>Chiapas was one of the minority of states where the PRI came out on top in the presidential poll, and the party was desperate to hold onto the governorship to show it could keep total collapse at bay. </p> <p>As a result, there had been fears of violence from PRI-linked paramilitary groups which emerged after the Zapatista uprising in 1994. </p> <p>There were also predictions of widespread dirty tricks. A 4,000-strong army of observers spread out across the mainly rural state on polling day, but there were few major incidents. A low turnout was blamed on intimidation. </p> <p>Acknowledging defeat, the incumbent PRI governor, Roberto Albores, said: \"I plead with all the Chiapanecos who did not vote for the winner to accept the decision of the majority. It is an order that we must follow for the good and the calm of Chiapas and Mexico,\" he said. </p> <p>Chiapas was always considered a PRI stronghold, largely because of local strongmen who kept the rank and file in line. The opposition was divided, and Zapatista communities have tended to view electoral politics as a waste of time. </p> <p>But Mr Salazar's campaign gathered steam in the wake of Mr Fox's victory, and he managed to bring together the right of centre PAN and its long-running leftwing rival, the Democratic Revolution party ( PRD) within his alliance. </p> <p>A political analyst, Alfonso Zarate, said the Chiapas poll was \"the dispute between the new democratic political order that has been strengthened by July 2 elections and the vestiges of the ancien regime seeking to resist the changes\". </p> <p>The poll has been seen as a possible turning point in the Zapatista conflict. Mr Fox has expressed his wish to push for a negotiated solution. \"As president-elect my commitment and my obligation is to work together with Pablo Salazar with the aim of achieving peace,\" he said in a statement in which he promised to dust off a 1996 peace agreement on indigenous rights, known as the San Andres Accords. </p> <p>The accords were shelved by the outgoing administration of President Ernesto Zedillo, prompting the rebels led by the masked sub-comandante Marcos to break off all dialogue and withdraw to jungle hide-outs. </p> <p>Marcos himself has been notably silent about the country's new political situation. But most analysts believe the rebels, whose support has been waned over the years, could not afford to remain aloof from a Fox peace offensive supported by Governor Salazar. </p> <p>But in the highland Zapatista community of Polho, the election was viewed with ambiguity. Sitting in front of a large handpainted sign adorned with pictures of masked fighters and indigenous peasants and announcing \"Welcome to the autonomous municipality of Polho in rebellion,\" Filomeno Hernandez said the new president and governor would have to prove their openness to Zapatista demands before the negotiations could restart. </p> <p>\"We will wait to see what happens. If the army was withdrawn then sure, we would think about negotiating.\"</p>",
  "The most intractable of the issues preventing a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians is the future of Jerusalem. It was this that provoked the breakdown of the negotiations at Camp David last month. Now the question is whether another round of discussions can offer any better prospect of success. Both sides have adopted such entrenched positions that is difficult to see how either could contemplate a compromise solution. Yet some form of compromise there must be if there is ever to be real peace between them. And since the rivalry over the city is the main obstacle that must be overcome, it is important to be clear about the arguments. <p>The Israeli government insists that Jerusalem is the \"eternal and undivided capital\" of the Jewish state. Ehud Barak, like his predecessor as prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, repeats this slogan at every opportunity, so that most Israelis have come to believe it (though the outside world has not) as though it were a judgment handed down from on high. But it remains no more than a slogan and a moment's reflection is enough to remind us that it embodies a claim without substance, whether in terms of international law or as a simple matter of fact. The Israelis occupied East Jerusalem, with its wholly Arab population, by force of arms in 1967, and have remained there as an occupying power ever since. Acting unilaterally and in defiance of a series of UN resolutions, the Israeli government has annexed the Arab sector and established there a number of racially exclusive settlements - all of this against the strongly expressed wishes of the indigenous population. </p> <p>It would be difficult to imagine a more openly illegal position than that of the Israeli government in Jerusalem. Everything about it is contrary to international law. Soon after the occupation began, the UN security council adopted the famous resolution 242, whose opening clause confirmed the basic principle that \"the acquisition of territory by war is inadmissible\". As regards Jerusalem, the security council ruled unanimously (resolution 267) that any attempt by the Israeli government to alter the status of Jerusalem would be invalid. In other words, the prolonged occupation of East Jerusalem and its annexation, together with all the changes the Israelis imposed on the city, including especially the settlements they built and the colonies of Jewish settlers they planted on Arab land - all these constitute defiance of specific rulings by the body that expresses at the highest level the will of the international community. </p> <p>And there is another weakness in the Israeli case over Jerusalem. The suggestion that the city is the \"undivided\" capital of Israel is easily disproved. Take a taxi in West Jerusalem and ask the Jewish driver to take you to an address in East Jerusalem and he will refuse, even if he knows the address, which is unlikely. Apart from a small number of open-minded Israelis, the Jewish population of West Jerusalem do not visit East Jerusalem or have anything to do with it. Whether the Israeli government likes to admit it or not, Jerusalem is divided - and no amount of rhetoric can disguise the fact. So the Israeli desire to retain control of East Jerusalem has nothing to do with justice or the wishes of its citizens. It is an expression of what we used to call imperialism, the desire of one people to lord it over another - which is supposed to have gone out of the window long ago. </p> <p>What then of the Palestinian side of the argument? Why do the Palestinians believe they have the right to exercise sovereignty over East Jerusalem? If you were to ask those of them who live there, they would answer \"because it is our home\"; and if you went on to ask Palestinians who live in Israel and the occupied territories or in refugee camps in the countries round about, they would say \"because Jerusalem has been the focal point of our homeland for a thousand years\". And that, in simple human terms, ought surely to be enough. </p> <p>But besides this natural and easily understood feeling, the Palestinians have on their side two supporting arguments. First, they ask only for what is theirs. They make no claim on territory inhabited by others - even though what is now Jewish West Jerusalem consists largely of property seized in 1948 from its Arab owners. Second, they have the backing of international law, as expressed in those UN resolutions and in the various conventions designed to govern relations between peoples and to protect the rights of the weak against the powerful. </p> <p>So what conclusion can one suggest to a dispute where the balance of power is so uneven? Thirty years ago, wrestling with the same problem, I wrote in the Guardian that if the Israelis insisted on keeping control of the Old City of Jerusalem, peace would be out of anyone's reach. The same is true today. </p> <p>But I added then (and this is also true today) that there was \"an alternative which the Israelis might be wise to consider before it is too late. This is not withdrawal, which would divide the city once again; not internationalisation, which has little appeal for either side; but a condominium, which would be the starting point for a wider experiment in coexistence and which would preserve the unity of the city, but with no victors and no vanquished, no masters and no second class citizens, no angry clash of eager but ill-condered ambitions. And that might indeed be the New Jerusalem.\" </p> <p> Michael Adams is a research fellow in the politics department of Exeter University and a former Middle East correspondent of the Guardian </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "On September 18 1997, the CIA celebrated its 50th anniversary with a discreet ceremony at its headquarters at Langley, Virginia. Director George Tenet awarded special medallions to 50 past and present staff for their outstanding contributions to postwar American intelligence. High up the list was David Blee, who has died aged 83, although his predictably obscure citation praised him simply for \"creating a professional counterintelligence discipline\". <p>But this bland phrasing masked Blee's extraordinary achievement in unscrambling the ghastly mess that James Angleton, one of the most famous names in the espionage world - and for 21 years the CIA's all-powerful head of counter-intelligence - had created before the agency finally dispensed with his services in 1974. </p> <p>For two of the most hostile decades of the cold war, Angleton's job to was detect double agents. He began to run off the rails in 1963 after Kim Philby, once one of MI6's most senior officers, fled to Moscow. The two spies had become close friends when Philby was serving in Washington, and Angleton feared that some of the secrets might have come from his own indiscreet exchanges with Philby during their bouts of heavy drinking. He never got over this personal and professional betrayal. </p> <p>Unfortunately for the CIA, this drama hit Angleton just as he began debriefing a low-level KGB defector named Anatoly Golitsyn. Golitsyn actually knew very little of any value, but had a powerful manner - one CIA official said he was \"like a Prussian warrant officer\" - and a vivid imagination. He managed to convince Angleton, who now saw traitors round every corner, that any future Soviet defectors would almost certainly be KGB plants. (Later, a CIA psychological assessment classified Golitsyn as a paranoid). </p> <p>Within months, and in breach of all regulations, Angleton was trying to detect Soviet moles by passing highly classified intelligence files to Golitsyn, not only from the CIA's archives but also from those of the FBI. Golitsyn simply recycled this mine of information to sustain his own credibility. Angleton also began to treat anyone doubting Golitsyn's credibility as a probable KGB agent - and several American officers' careers were seriously blighted as a result. </p> <p>Under Golitsyn's influence, Angleton categorised even such high-level defectors as Oleg Penkovsky, who gave America 10,000 pages of invaluable Soviet military information, as KGB plants. Eventually, in an almost insane fever of suspicion, Angleton established a special investigation group to probe into such suspected Soviet agents as Harold Wilson, Willy Brandt, Olaf Palme, Lester Pearson, Averell Harriman and Henry Kissinger. </p> <p>The farcical denouement of this growing madness came when Ed Petty, a member of the special group, produced a report citing 25 examples of suspicious behaviour by Angleton himself, arguing that his disastrous impact on the CIA's Soviet division demonstrated that he was under Kremlin control. Petty took his report to David Blee, then a senior operations officer, who immediately ordered a full investigation. This cleared Angleton, but at last drew attention to the appalling effect his unwavering acceptance of Golitsyn's ludicrous pronouncements had had. </p> <p>In the course of the previous decade, the false accusations from the counter-intelligence division had not only created disastrous rifts with the CIA's overseas allies, but had stripped the agency of almost all its Soviet informants, who were repeatedly denounced as double agents. One of the most dramatic consequences was the CIA's failure to predict the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. </p> <p> Ironically, the end of this calamity came through Angleton's inability to keep his nose out of America's internal security, where it was specifically prohibited by law. In the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, he was revealed as the instigator of Operation Chaos, the CIA's unauthorised interception of domestic mail. He was summarily dismissed, and Blee embarked on the painstaking job of rebuilding the Soviet division. </p> <p>Born in San Francisco, Blee graduated from Stanford University in 1938, studied at Harvard Law School and served with the Office of Strategic Services in the Pacific during the second world war. He joined the CIA in 1947, when it replaced the OSS. One of his most notable coups came in 1965, when he managed to spirit Stalin's daughter, Svetlana, out of India after she had sought political asylum. </p> <p>In the aftermath of the six-day war in 1967, Blee took charge of CIA activities in the middle east. One of his major responsibilities was tracking the emergence of Palestinian guerrilla groups, in the hope of anticipating their increasingly violent actions against western targets. In 1971, he returned to Washington to take over the Soviet division. </p> <p> His record there, of course, is locked in Langley's deepest vaults, but the outside world caught a brief glimpse of his successes in 1994, when the US senate intelligence committee published its damning study of the Aldrich Ames espionage case. Moscow had paid Ames, a CIA employee with a serious drink problem, nearly $2m to hand over details of the Soviet division's operations. The official assessment, after Ames was sentenced to life imprisonment, showed how deeply Blee's recruits had managed to penetrate. </p> <p>\"After his arrest,\" the report noted, \"Ames acknowledged that he informed the Soviets about approximately 10 top-level cases as part of the information he passed on June 13 1985. Overall, Ames has acknowledged providing the Soviets with information on over a hundred Soviet and east European cases during his espionage. In addition, Ames had access to several hundred other Soviet and east European operational endeavours that he may have passed to the Soviets, but he says he is unable to remember specifics.\" </p> <p>Blee retired in 1985, unaware that his carefully crafted networks were, by then, being unravelled by yet another runaway drunk. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Margaret, and their four sons. </p> <p>\u0095 David Henry Blee, intelligence agent, born November 20 1916; died August 6 2000</p>"
