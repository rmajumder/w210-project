  "British firms are involved in the supply of barbaric torture equipment to Third World countries responsible for gross abuses of human rights, an Observer investigation can reveal. <p>The companies, which offered to help deliver leg irons, belly chains and hundreds of weapons, are flouting United Nations sanctions designed to prevent civilians being tortured. Known as 'brokers', they are exploiting loopholes in British laws which the Government has repeatedly promised to close. </p> <p>One Birmingham-based company, HPP, last week offered to help arrange delivery of leg irons and CS gas to a private security company in Rwanda, where ethnic tension between Hutu and Tutsi tribes is still simmering after up to a million people died in the 1994 genocide. </p> <p>In negotiations with an undercover reporter posing as a representative of a private company, HPP faxed a series of quotations for the consignment and said the equipment was to be flown to Rwanda by a Spanish-based company called Larrangua y Elorza. </p> <p>The total cost - for 35 hand-and-leg cuffs, 25 leg cuffs, 10 belly chains and 300 CS gas canisters - was \u00a31,720. HPP quoted the price in pesetas but indicated it would be happy for the goods to be paid for with a sterling cheque drawn on a British high street bank. </p> <p>The quotations, signed by Mary Barford, a director of HPP, offered delivery in two to three weeks. Asked about the company's activities, Barford said last week that her firm only passed the details of the deal to the Spanish company and denied any further involvement. 'It is just not our business. We don't sell anything like this. [Passing on the demands] is the sum total of our involvement.' </p> <p>Supplying CS gas to a private company in Rwanda - such as the one specified by The Observer's reporter - is a breach of UN sanctions prohibiting the delivery of weapons to anyone other than the government or peace-keeping forces in the war-torn central African state. The use of leg irons contravenes the UN's standard minimum rule for treatment of prisoners, passed more than 40 years ago. </p> <p>Belly chains are attached around the stomach like a belt. Handcuffs and legcuffs are attached to them, preventing movement of arms and legs. They can also be used for joining prisoners together. </p> <p>Shortly after coming to power in 1997, the Labour Government announced that anyone exporting leg irons would need licences. However, as with restrictions on the export of weapons, it is still easy for businesses based in the UK to arrange sales from points overseas. The Metropolitan Police had to drop a recent investigation into a businessman alleged to have sold electric shock batons to the Cypriot police. The Crown Prosecution Service ruled that, because the batons were bought in the United States, there was no case to answer, even though the deal was brokered in the UK. </p> <p>'Torture is an obscenity and it is appalling that loopholes in British law can allow companies based in this country to keep torturers supplied with the tools of their trade,' said a spokesman for Amnesty, the London-based human rights group. </p> <p>'Stories like this are a major embarrassment to the Government which, more than four years after the Scott Report [into arms to Iraq], is yet to introduce legislation to stop this disgusting trade.' The Government last week admitted it had dropped laws proposed in a recent White Paper from the parliamentary schedule for the next year. </p> <p>Both leg irons and CS gas have a terrible history in Rwanda. CS gas was used at least once by the Interahamwe Hutu militia to flush sheltering Tutsis out of buildings before hacking them to death. In the town of Kibuye thousands of Tutsis were killed as they fled a football stadium after gas canisters were thrown in. </p> <p>Leg irons have been used by military intelligence officers in Rwanda in the torture of prisoners. </p> <p>Larrangua y Elorza, which is based near Bilbao in northern Spain, boasts of having commercial relationships in dozens of countries worldwide. Data from Amnesty reveals that the company - which specialises in leg irons and handcuffs - is represented in at least seven countries, including Chile, Pakistan, Mexico, Thailand and Yemen, which have a record of misuse of 'restraint' devices. </p> <p>There are dozens of UK companies that have exploi-ted loopholes in UK legislation and continue 'brokering'. British Customs officers are investigating a series of air freight specialists in London and Gatwick who organise transport for arms shipments from eastern Europe to central and west Africa. </p> <p>Rwanda was the destinations for dozens of arms shipments brokered by British, French, South African and Bulgarian companies in the early Nineties. Many of these companies are still trading. </p> <p>The Government is under increasing pressure to close the loophole. Next week a motion at the Trades Union Congress will call for urgent legislation to curb the practice. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jason.burke@observer.co.uk\">jason.burke@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Few motorists cursing rising petrol prices will have heard of Hugo Chavez, but the paratrooper-turned-president of Venezuela is at the heart of the re-emergence of the Opec cartel. <p>Over the past 18 months Chavez has rekindled Opec unity, reinvigorating the cartel as a force on the world stage. The fruits of his labour are apparent in a quadrupling of the oil price since his arrival in power in 1998. </p> <p>Last month Chavez toured all 10 of Venezuela's fellow Opec members. He became the first foreign head of state since the Gulf war to visit Saddam Hussein and he got on famously with Libya's Colonel Gadaffi. He revels in his role as an international champion of the impoverished masses. </p> <p>Today, his Oil Minister, Ali Rodriguez, will be beating a drum for only a token increase in oil production at the Opec meeting in Vienna. The West is hoping for an increase of at least 700,000 barrels a day. Any thing less is likely to see the oil price shoot up, and stock markets dive. </p> <p>But Chavez's real moment will come at the end of the month when he hosts the first Opec heads of state meeting for 25 years in Caracas. </p> <p>It is a remarkable coup considering Venezuela is a relatively minor producer of oil and pre-Chavez was barely engaged in Opec's affairs. </p> <p>When he came to office, the price of a barrel was in the region of $8 and Venezuela was heading for a devastating recession. Around 70 per cent of exports and 60 per cent of tax income is generated by oil, and the price is now $33. </p> <p>But before Chavez's presidency, Venezuela had consistently sabotaged Opec's attempts to raise prices, by deliberately producing more than its official quota. </p> <p>Chavez was determined to change that. He joined forces with the world's biggest producer - Saudi Arabia - and non-Opec Mexico in agreeing production cuts that helped turn the tide. </p> <p>Arguing for a 'multi polar' world, and against the scourge of 'savage neoliberalism', Chavez is not the first Venezuelan leader to seek to parlay oil wealth into influence on the world stage. </p> <p>At last week's UN world leader's summit he offered to supply oil 'on favourable terms' to cash-strapped Central American nations. </p> <p>Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez first came to the world's attention in February of 1992, when he tried - and failed - to overthrow the elected government of Venezuela in a military coup. Arrested and brought before the TV cameras, Chavez turned defeat into a kind of victory with the briefest political speech of his life. </p> <p>'Chavez's appearance on television lasted for just over a minute,' notes Richard Gott, author of a recent book on the Venezuelan president. 'Its unexpected result was to turn him from a wholly unknown colonel into a national figure.' </p> <p>A tough-talking, leftist populist, Chavez comes from humble origins in the rural hinterland. He looks and talks like ordinary Venezuelans. </p> <p>He brought the military back into politics, lambasted the media, the church hierarchy and the 'oligarchs'. And he tackled the issue of the low oil price. He considers any return to such low prices as 'passing a death sentence' on Opec countries. </p> <p>But even as Chavez was addressing the UN summit, a local newspaper headline summed up the challenge: 'Oil rises to $35 a barrel,' it read, 'and poverty reaches 81 per cent.'</p> <p><br><a href=\"http://www.unostra.com\" target=\"_new\">French haulier's association</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.eurotunnel.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Eurotunnel</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Starstruck </strong>C4 <br><strong>Last of the Blonde Bombshells </strong>BBC1 <br><strong>Blind Ambition </strong>ITV </p> <p>'Yes, I realise I was quite lovely!' mused Sylvia Syms as she flicked through some dog-eared 10 x 8s in the final part of Channel 4's unflinchingly unsentimental documentary series, <strong>Starstruck</strong>. Time and space ensured Syms's ambivalence about the girl she had once been - the one who graduated swiftly from pretty-as-a-picture ing\u00e9nue roles in would-be hip-looking Brit flicks of the 1950s entitled 'Whoops! There goes my virginity, Daddio!', to perspiring fetchingly in crisp, unbuttoned poplin opposite John Mills in Ice Cold In Alex, a 'classic' British movie even for those those who have only seen it spoofed in a lager commercial. </p> <p>Anyway, the point is that Sylvia has worked steadily as an actress for the whole of her adult life without ever being very rich or famous (nope, that's Joan. And that's Sims ) while even at her most pulchritudinous, she was, she admitted, never perceived to be 'a sex symbol like Di Dors', despite the fact that 'Philip Larkin once told me he had had fantasies about me when he was at school'. </p> <p>Now, of course, the girlish prettiness is wreathed in elderly fat and Sylvia does rumpled, mildly bonkers, national treasure-ish comedic turns in series like the bafflingly popular At Home with the Braithwaites . She may have talked about admiring Joan Collins's ability to work (so terribly hard!) at remaining glamorous, but the inference was clear - some ladies of a certain age act , darling, and some ladies of a certain age must struggle and self-flagellate in pursuit of a frankly pointless Norma Desmondish glamour . But, really, never the twain. </p> <p>Sylvia was snappily petulant and occasionally rather fierce. 'I was never a star let. I was an act ress!' she corrected the interviewer peevishly. But later she said that though her own career has been solid (and judged by the industry norm, quite madly successful), she had really 'always wanted to be Judi Dench. Or Prunella Scales. Or Maggie Smith. Or, for a while, Glenda Jackson.' </p> <p>Which was both sweet and sort of brave to admit and immediately made me wonder about the complex thespian pecking order and whom Judi, Prunella and Maggie might secretly yearn to be, if anybody. </p> <p>Dame Judi is, of course, peerless when it comes to playing warmly bossy and slightly strident British queens and those pea-in-a-pod, middle-class wives of the pine kitchen, oversized cashmere and carriage drive variety. I can't, however, imagine her doing either an American accent or haute glamour, so I hope she harbours a wee-small-hours-of-the-morning fantasy about what it might be to be Joan Collins. Imagine: Judi and Warren Beatty! Judi in Dynasty ! Judi in shoulder pads! Judi in heart-shaped swimming-pools! Judi in (and out) of love! </p> <p>Interestingly, in Alan Plater's one-off drama, <strong>Last of the Blonde Bombshells</strong>, Judi could easily have played alongside either Joan or Sylvia (and, in fact, the girl who played the young Judi looked just like the Ice Cold -era Syms). Instead, she found herself with mature co-stars as diverse as Cleo Laine, Olympia Dukakis, Leslie Caron, June Whitfield, Billie Whitelaw (whom I mistook, briefly and bizarrely, for Sue Johnston: good news for Sue, less so for Billie) and Joan Sims; obviously, there had to be a Sims, or a Syms, in there somewhere. </p> <p>Dame Judi's character, Elizabeth, was a feisty, freshly widowed mother of some desperately dull adult children and a sweet grandchild - played, rather shockingly, by a child actor who spoke with received pronunciation - whom she liked to scare by using the F-word. Oh, how we love a dame who can curse as effortlessly as if she had Tourette's syndrome. </p> <p>(This was, incidentally, a co-production with the US company HBO, home of The Sopranos and Sex and the City , where women, even dames, behaving badly may well be a contractual obligation.) </p> <p>Elizabeth had a past as a tenor sax-playing schoolgirl member of a wartime female big band, the Blonde Bombshells, so we got a lot of those over-stylised 1940s scenes in which the blondes are just a bit too blonde, the dresses too bright and tight, the lipstick too red, the jiving too synchronised and the GIs far too pleased with their Rada Frank Sinatra routines. </p> <p>And there was really no plot to speak of - widow struggles to reform band for her granddaughter's school dance while fending off the advances of the ageing Lothario (Ian Holm) who had once dragged-up to avoid conscription while playing drums for (and sleeping with) the Bombshells - just the opportunity to say things like: 'Isn't Leslie Caron fabulous?'; 'Olympia Dukakis looks like she should be in Some Like It Hot '; 'How many facelifts do you think Cleo Laine has had?'; 'Ah, Judi's doing her Fine Romance routine again'; 'I do love Sylvia Syms. Or is it Joan?' But, though slight and predictable and cosy and largely pointless, I couldn't have known then that Bombshells was going to turn out to be far and away the best drama of last week. </p> <p>BBC1's two-parter, <strong>Waking the Dead</strong>, in which, oddly, Sue Johnston looked nothing like Billie Whitelaw, was a very bad drama. But I can't dwell on the merely bad, I must move straight on to the worst drama - <strong>Blind Ambition</strong>. This starred Robson Green as a runner who has a car crash, loses his sight, gets a bit angry, pulls himself together and decides to run again, for glory and gold, in the Sydney Paralympics. </p> <p>Robson, you may be aware, is a very handsome man who vacillates prettily between furrowed intensity and lean machismo and has carved himself a very successful career in the process, even surviving singing 'Unchained Melody' on Top of the Pops alongside that Jerome, lately of the execrable Badger. </p> <p>Indeed, until this week, I had assumed that Green's success must be attributable to his acting ability being the equal of his looks, but I was wrong: Blind Ambition revealed that the man has all the emotional range and intelligence of Rainbow's Bungle. No, sorry, make that Zippy, because I think Bungle had a comparatively rich, albeit largely inarticulated, interior life. Still, Blind Ambition was bad in so many ways that it is unfair to lay the blame wholly at Robson's plywood door of a performance, even though it's fun. No - Imogen Stubbs, as the emotionally rejected wife, must share some of it. </p> <p>What kind of a casting decision was this, precisely, because Stubbs played a part-time primary-school teacher living in a Newcastle terrace as though she were a Notting Hill hausfrau with a taste for organic tofu and St John's Wort. </p> <p>Even the running scenes, during which viewers were surely meant to be moved, or excited or something , looked like actors running highly unconvincingly for a director haunted by Chariots of Fire and therefore desperate to avoid slo-mo and any sort of a tune that may remind us of Van-da-da-da-da-daa-da!-gelis. </p> <p>So, instead, we got fast-mo and house music, while the scenes shot in Sydney, at the Olympic stadium, looked as if they had been done with a combination of skin-of-the-teeth access and extras, which they had.</p>",
  "<p>Nigella Lawson had people round for dinner last Wednesday night. Not a dinner party, you note, but people round for dinner. I know this because I saw her doing it on Nigella Bites, her wouldn't-you-like-to-be-me? slot on Channel 4. The guests arrived in their day clothes and sat in a gallery off the kitchen while Nigella chucked some help-yourself starters at them. There were both men and women present, but the numbers did not quite balance and it was not clear who belonged to whom, if anyone at all. In my home this would have meant that something had gone terribly wrong. In Nigella's it just seemed fresh, pleasant and exactly right for the way we live now. </p> <p>The dinner party qua dinner party is stone cold dead, suffocated by its own formality and pretension. Sometime around 1997 people stopped enjoying the palaver of playing restaurants in their own home. </p> <p>Suzie Carpenter, a 38-year-old fund manager, reckons that in the early to mid-Nineties two of her Saturdays each month were taken up either attending or hosting dinner parties. 'These days,' she says, 'I have nothing to do with either.' Carpenter has a point. There was always something effortful about the whole business of eating food with friends. Inviting eight people to your house for four hours on a Saturday night was as nerve-racking as staging the Mikado for one night only in Regent's Park. What about the costumes and the set? Would people remember their lines? </p> <p>'It was the whole performance element which wore me out in the end,' says Mary Oliver, 36, a publisher, who also doesn't do dinner any more. 'Not just worrying about whether the food was grand enough, but whether the chat was sufficiently clever. I felt as if I was being asked to record an edition of Start the Week in my own dining room. You'd have to book the key guests - the funny, clever, important ones - weeks in advance. Then you had to shuffle your Beta friends - the pretty ones, the good listeners - around them and hope that there was some kind of spark.' </p> <p>And if the spark turned into a house fire, so much the better. Carpenter admits that in the mid-Nineties she did not consider her dinner parties a success unless voices had been raised and tempers roused. 'It didn't really matter if the subject was politics, economics or a new movie, I was trying to create an event. If people spent the whole evening smiling quietly at each other I worried that the proceedings had lapsed into suburban banality.' </p> <p>The fall-back option was to whip up an atmosphere of competitive sexual frankness. 'It became a contest as to who could be the rudest. By the end of the evening you'd have the primmest people claiming to have given blow jobs on the way over. Anything so as not to feel left out.' </p> <p>Not feeling left out was always the main preoccupation of the dinner party guest. 'It was like being part of a therapy group,' remembers Sarah Sanders, 32. 'The roles were established very early in the proceedings. If you didn't leap in right at the beginning, over drinks, and show yourself to be a fun person, a player, then you were doomed to be the one who helped the hostess hand round the dishes. You couldn't get back into the game after the first course was over.' </p> <p>There was a sense, too, of being bound by a contract, all the stricter for being unspoken. As a guest you were expected to bring your particular gift - wit, beauty, kindness - in return for a meal in which your hosts had invested up to \u00a3200 and the whole of Saturday. 'On one occasion the hostess thanked me at the end of the evening for being \"on such great form\",' remembers Carpenter. 'Far from feeling flattered I realised that she'd spent the evening totting up whether I was giving sufficient value for money.' </p> <p>Being expected to sing for your supper is one thing. Being expected to do it over five hours is another. 'Dinner parties went on for too long, it was simple as that,' says Sanders, 'the first two and a half hours were fun, but after that it was like being trapped in an endless and increasingly exhausting repeat. By 11pm I'd used up my sparkle dust and was aching to go home.' </p> <p>There was always the added torture of being stuck next to other people's husbands. You might start off chirpy and charming, nodding away as some man you were never going to meet again talked about telecommunications in eastern Europe (his speciality, naturally, not yours). By the end of the evening you'd have found it impossible to register interest if he'd suddenly announced that he was a KGB colonel. </p> <p>Dinner parties have always flourished when the middle-class felt that it was doing well and wanted everyone to know. Aristocrats and royalty had their banqueting halls and state rooms, those semi-public spaces dedicated to entertaining outsiders. But it wasn't until the nineteenth century that the middle-class family decided to put itself on display by asking other people to come into its private space and watch it performing the everyday task of eating. </p> <p>By playing on the ambiguity that this was how they always ate, complete with the best china and the finest food, the middle-class host and hostess (the job of entertaining having recently switched to women) were making a statement about how much they were worth. Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management (1861) , aimed at aspiring middle-class families, thought nothing of suggesting a six-course menu plan for 30 guests which included larded partridges and ginger ice-cream. </p> <p>Dinner parties flourished again from the late Sixties and into the Seventies, when the middle-classes were once again on the up. As in Mrs Beeton's day, social origins were less important than how you performed in the social moment. Chairs from Habitat or a recipe from Elizabeth David went a long way towards erasing the humblest of beginnings. That's why, in the Eighties and Nineties, with the meritocracy of materialism dissolving any remaining class allegiances (what kind of olive oil you served was more important than whether you said 'toilet'), the dinner party once again reigned supreme. </p> <p>'It was about showing off, really,' says Carpenter, 'it was about saying \"look how much I'm worth, socially, financially, culturally.\" And I think, in the end, we all got tired of it'. Certainly, once it got so easy to fake good food - thanks to a library of TV chef cookbooks and the resources of St Michael - there was little point in sweating over a menu plan. Suddenly, trying so hard started to seem not only pointless but pass\u00e9. And then there's the fact that in recent years 'home' has been elevated into a state of mind as well as bricks and mortar. </p> <p>'I look on my home as a kind of sanctuary,' says Sanders, 'and I don't want to turn it into an arena for social display. I don't want it tainted by that kind of competitive vibe. These days the only people who visit me in my domestic space are very close friends and family who genuinely want to talk and listen - and they're happy with a bowl of spaghetti round the kitchen table.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, the economy is booming and people want to play. There are still friendships to be cemented and contacts to be nurtured and, if not at dinner parties, then where? The cocktail party is making a comeback, its drop-in, drop-out format perfectly suited to those who can't bear talking to strangers for more than an hour. It also has the advantage of allowing you to move in on interesting people and shake off bores. And for those occasions when only a proper sit-down dinner will do, the new trend is to follow the Americans and meet friends in a restaurant. That way you split the cost, avoid the washing up and, unless you are Nigella Lawson, the chances are the food will be better than anything you could have made yourself.</p>",
  "<b> Marigold </b> <p>These flowers have a long history of cultivation, probably because they are prolific, floriferous and have many medicinal and culinary uses. In the kitchen, marigolds were used as a cheap substitute for saffron. In the Middle Ages, marigolds were deemed to be useful as a treatment for insect and snake bites. When taken internally they were said to have healing properties for the intestine and liver. </p> <p> Soil conditions: grows best in poor soil. Situate: in sun or light shade. Propagation: sow directly in the garden in spring, then again in summer. Will self-seed readily. Resilience: hardy annual. Care: watch out for greenfly. </p> <p> <b> Clematis </b></p> <p>The first foreign species arrived from Spain in 1569, and the opening up of the Far East - Japan was effectively closed to the West until the mid-19th century - created a frenzy of plant collecting, with many species arriving from Korea, China and Japan. The clematis thrives in mixed company. It will grow in pots if the roots are kept cool by under planting, but it comes into its own as it adorns vertical structures, walkways and trees. </p> <p> Flowering season: different varieties flower through the season. Soil conditions: rich free-draining soil. Situate: in full sunlight or partial shade, but protect the roots from the sun. Propagation: sow seed when ripe under glass - it won't always come true. Layering is an easier way to increase stocks. Resilience: hardy-to-slightly frost-prone. Care: support young plants until they are established. Mulch with well-rotted manure or compost in winter. Prune late-flowering clematis in winter for maximum flowers. Others need little pruning except to shape. Wilt - caused by a fungus - affects large-flowered clematis. Planting them deeply encourages extra shoots, to increase chances of survival. </p> <p> <b> Cosmos </b></p> <p>Surprisingly resilient for a plant of such apparent fragility, it seems entirely appropriate that its name comes from the Greek Kosmos , meaning beautiful. The plants are relatively new to the gardens of Europe. Cosmos astrosanguineus arrived in Britain in 1835 when William Thompson of Ipswich had seeds sent to him from Mexico. It is a perennial that bears blooms of the deepest brownish-maroon from mid-summer onwards, smelling, astonishingly of chocolate. </p> <p> Flowering season: all summer into autumn. Soil conditions: rich, moist soil that is free draining. Situate: in full sunshine. Propagation: if grown in pots, sow in early spring; late spring, sow directly in the garden. Resilience: hardy and semi-hardy species. Care: deadhead for a longer flowering season, leaving some to self-seed. Aphids and slugs love them. Lift half-hardy perennials in frost-prone areas. </p> <p> <b> Montbretia </b></p> <p>Crocosmia takes its name from the Greek krokos , meaning saffron, and osme , smell. Intriguingly, the flowers have no scent when growing, but dried and subsequently steeped in water they develop the perfume of the crocus. Modern montbretias are derived from two closely related plants, tritonia and crocosmia, both native to South Africa. </p> <p> Flowering season: all summer to autumn. Soil conditions: humus-enriched soil that drains freely. Situate: either in full sunlight or some shade. Propagation: sow ripe seed in pots under glass. Lift and divide established clumps in spring. Resilience: hardy except with prolonged frost. Care: protect with a mulch in the first winter of growth and also if there is a continuing frost. Watch out for spider mites. </p> <p> <b> Cyclamen </b></p> <p>The name cyclamen comes from the Greek word for circle, kuklos , and the ancient Greeks knew it as chelonion , or little tortoise, to which they likened its corm. Over the centuries, the cyclamen has had many medicinal applications. The Greek philosopher Theophrastus suggested using it to heal wounds and boils. During the Renaissance, when it was believed that like healed like, the ear-shaped leaves of the plant were supposed to indicate that it could cure earache. In England, in the late 16th century, cyclamen was used to induce childbirth, it was deemed so potent that pregnant women were advised to avoid it at all costs, until needed. </p> <p> Flowering season: all year, depending on species. </p> <p>Soil conditions: fairly rich soil with high humus content that drains freely. Situate: in dappled shade. Propagation: soak ripe seeds for 12 hours before sowing. Keep in dark until germinated. Resilience: most are hardy, except for pot plants. Care: outdoors mulch each year with leaf mould when leaves have died back. Pot plants need a cool draught-free spot. Water them from below and feed sparingly with a liquid low-nitrogen feed. </p> <p> <b> Globe artichoke </b></p> <p>The Ancient Egyptians were the first to cultivate the globe artichoke, the Arabs introduced it to Spain and Italy in the 15th century, and by the 16th century, it was being grown in France and England. Medicinally, the plant is thought to be beneficial for the liver and kidneys. The most effective parts of the plant are said to be the leaves and roots. </p> <p> Flowering season: summer through to autumn. Soil conditions: rich soil that drains freely. Situate: in full sunshine, sheltered from wind. Propagation: sow seed in pots under glass in spring or take root cuttings in spring or autumn. Resilience: hardy, but give extra protection from frost. Care: in winter protect roots with a dry mulch. Watch out for aphids and slugs, which adore them. </p> <p> <b> Dahlia </b></p> <p>Natives of Mexico and Central America, dahlias were grown by the Aztecs, who reputedly ate the tubers. The Spanish sent them back to the Old World, but they weren't immediately popular - opinions differed on their flavour and their palatability. Dahlias finally began to be appreciated for their flowers in Europe in the late-18th century. By the early 19th century, new hybrids were being developed in France and the popularity of the dahlia took off. </p> <p> Flowering season: from early summer through to autumn. Soil conditions: soil with a high humus content. Situate: in full sun. Propagation: bedding plants should be sown under glass in spring. Plant in the garden when frosts are over. Start tubers in early spring under glass, divide into sections, each with a plump bud, and plant out after frosts. Resilience: frost-tender. Care: dead-heading prolongs flowering. Stake taller examples. Feed weekly in early summer with fertiliser which has a high nitrogen content. Cut back after flowering, dig up the tubers and store in a dry place protected from frost. </p> <p> <b> Sunflower </b></p> <p>The sunflower gets its name because the flower follows the sun's path across the sky each day. It's a straight translation of the Latin name, which comes from the Greek helios , meaning sun, and anthos , flower. According to legend, Helios, the Greek god of the sun, was drowned by his uncles, the Titans, and has resided in the sky ever since. </p> <p> Flowering season: from the middle to the end of summer. Soil conditions: rich soil with added humus that drains freely. Situate: in full sunshine. Propagation: annuals can be sown in the garden in both spring and autumn. Resilience: annuals are hardy. Care: tall species need to be supported. </p> <p> <b> Nerine </b></p> <p>The autumn-flowering nerine is named from Neried , the Greek water-nymph. There are 30 species of this bulbous perennial, found on mountainsides, rocky outcrops and dry areas in their native habitat in southern Africa. </p> <p> Flowering season: early to late autumn. Soil conditions: soil that drains freely. Situate: in full sunlight. Propagation: sow seeds in pots in a glass cold frame when they are ripe. Plant bulbs in either spring or autumn with their necks exposed, using a compost that contains loam. Resilience: some are hardy, some are frost-prone. Care: bulbs like to be crowded. Keep moist when growing, warm and dry while dormant. Outside they should be mulched in cold weather. Watch out for slugs.</p>",
  "<p>Kerri Sharp has had quite a lot of jobs. She was once a goatherd in Crete: 'I lived in a cave and drank a bottle of brandy a day.' She was once a topless ice-cream seller in St Tropez. There was a brief period as a bus conductor in Torquay and a sojourn in a squat in Stoke Newington screen-printing Anarchy T-shirts for Malcolm McLaren.

Her mother, possibly afraid of this, sent her only daughter to a Catholic convent in Wanstead. 'I loathed that miserable God with his white beard and wagging finger.' </p> <p>It was not the right place for an eight-year-old who stuck nude pin-ups of Marilyn Monroe on the door of her locker and devoted her time to the Rudy Trudies, a club whose sole mission was to go out and find naughty pictures.

Not all of his 200 enterprises make money, but Black Lace continues to be a success story. Three million books sold to date, in fact. Three million books that describe a vast range of proclivities. Vampires. Nordic gods. Gang bangs. Ice hockey. You name it. </p> <p>Ladies who lust are a faithful market. And a big one. While men will always reach for the top shelf and go for the gyno, women want words, and particularly words that are formed into phrases such as 'rock-hard' and 'Sit on my desk, Sister Clarissa'. Where once the female reader liked to read about kindly Mills &amp; Boon medics living in market towns, now they are absorbed by dark alleys and drag queens. Engagement rings and coy kisses have been replaced by whipping and ramming. </p> <p>'There's nothing wrong with romance,' says Sharp. 'But today's Black Lace books should be primarily concerned with hot, kinky sex, and not be ashamed to explore the filthiest behaviour. Being brave is what it's all about.' </p> <p>Sharp's own sexuality is coloured by adventure, and her love life has been enhanced by exotic scenery. 'I tried to be a lesbian for a year,' she says. 'But you weren't allowed to wear wigs.' Then there was a Rastafarian 'who taught me how to cook' and a man she met down the pub who had long blond hair, looked like a surfer, and spoke like a south London mechanic. 'My god, he was so pretty. He was going like, \"Have you got stockings and suspenders and lovely bras?\" I was like, \"I don't mind dressing up and stuff...\" but he said, \"No, they're for me!\"' </p> <p>Now aged 40, happily single, though in a committed relationship, Sharp has no intention of getting married or having children. 'I'm not a thirtysomething, got a mortgage and a lovely little place in Battersea...' she says. 'You know: waiting for a wonderful man, can't wait to have babies and go on posh holidays to Tuscany, no, no, no...' </p> <p>The libido is a strange thing - don't even pretend you understand it - but as a creative force, it has long been imbued with clear cultural significance, related as it is to everything from legal censorship to progressive thought. </p> <p>The basic symbology of erotica has not changed since John Cleland described the 'delirous transports' [sic] of Fanny Hill in 1748. As the 1959 study 'Pornography and the Law' recorded some basic themes - seduction, defloration, permissive authority figure, rampant hussy and the 'brute' as a sexual symbol - so all these things can still be found in Black Lace narratives. The song remains the same. 'Saving Julie', Catharine McCabe's short story, opens with: 'Reverend Billy Washburn sat at his desk, one hand gently rubbing the erection growing down his long, muscular thigh' - which directly echoes a line in the 1877 classic The Autobiography of a Flea: 'Father Ambrose was the living personification of lust.' </p> <p>Erotic fiction is still rude, but its history has changed. Once the sole domain of male writers, it is now subsumed by the female imagination, and that imagination is purveying that most manly of concepts - sex without emotion. The Black Lace heroine has sex for the sake of it. Sex without commitment. Sex without babies. Sex on Hampstead Heath. She does not get involved. Hell, she hardly hangs around long enough to lace up her thigh-high leather boots. </p> <p>'Black Lace came along at exactly the right time,' says Sharp. 'It succeeded where women's porn magazines failed.' </p> <p>Black Lace was launched in 1993 after a Virgin marketing questionnaire revealed that women wanted kinky erotica that it was possible to buy without embarrassment. An advertisement in The Guardian for 'an unshockable female' produced Ms Sharp. </p> <p>At that point she was working for the glossy fetish magazine Skin Two, having graduated with a BA in film from the University of Westminster. Her heroes were Vivian Stanshall (the comic genius behind the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band) and Luis Bu\u00f1uel, but her belief system had crystallised the evening that she walked into a cinema in 1986 and saw Blue Velvet. </p> <p>'That film inspired me to study surreal directors, and I realised that the perverse subconscious was a valid form of emotional and artistic expression - to me, that is fantastically liberating, because it means living in a state of honesty rather than in a state of chintzy denial.' </p> <p>She settled into the Virgin office, then in Ladbroke Grove, and oversaw the first four books, one of which, Cassandra's Conflict, ignited a furore that ensured the success of the Black Lace series. The tale featured a sadomasochistic relationship, a dark master, a new nanny and an atmosphere of non-consensuality at a time when it was not clearly understood that the rape fantasy was about being overcome by a man of the mind's choice, rather than an actual desire to be maimed by some thug out of a drain in Hackney. </p> <p>'There was a lot of humiliation and violation in it,' says Sharp. 'And everyone went mad, saying, \"How dare you imply that women want to be hurt during sex\" and so on. The Daily Mail accused me of \"corrupting the morals of the nation's women and betraying civilised values\". The result was that they all sold out within a week.' </p> <p>Now, seven years later, Black Lace is respectable. Virgin publish two new novels and one reprint per month, each of which can expect to sell around 10,000 copies in England and America. There are popular collections of short stories and 'specials' are tacked as free gifts on to enlightened magazines, such as New Woman. The readers are from 18 to 40 years old and many of them, for some reason, are nurses. Sharp receives five unsolicited manuscripts a week and at least 10 short stories. She inclines towards writers that show some knowledge of the 'lineage of pulp fiction and cult films', and in general, she likes surprises. </p> <p>'I look for something that isn't an autobiographical piece about splitting up with your boyfriend and getting revenge by discovering your new sexuality,' she says. 'That's dull, and it is 80 per cent of what I get.' </p> <p>The authors range from Janine Ashbless, who composes erotic fairy tales in the tradition of Angela Carter, to 74-year-old Tesni Morgan, who manages to juggle her career with the demands made by nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. </p> <p>'I think erotic stories are enjoyed by career women who are too tired to have any emotional involvement,' Morgan theorises. 'They are often bringing up children on their own. They flop down, exhausted, after a day's work. All they want to do is relax with a glass of wine, and they would prefer to read a sexy book than deal with the stress that goes with a relationship.' </p> <p>Asked to name the writers who best epitomise the mood of the current sexual zeitgeist, Sharp cites Tabitha Flyte and Stella Black. Black has created an eponymous bisexual heroine with a degree from Oxford who wears black stilettos because she likes film noir. She lives in Hollywood, drives a mid-60s Firebird and packs a gun. She indulges in a wide range of postlapsarian pervery, her problems only arriving when she makes the mistake of falling in love. In this, she represents the basic schism that exists in erotic fiction for women: while relational values have always tended to thread through female erotica (and were the very thing that turned The Story of O into a work of quality), so they also impair emotional independence - and emotional independence is useful (if not indispensable) to the woman who wishes to be empowered by transgression. </p> <p>Erotic fiction is about having sex in complicated times. Sexism and body fascism still swamp popular culture and no one bothers to fight it any more. Commerce has won. Professional women undermined by the nesting instinct are in a double bind where the rules of the battle are that there are no rules and no obvious trophy. </p> <p>The result is a psychosexual schizophrenia that is encapsulated in Tabitha Flyte's short story 'The Chef's Revenge', where lewd Tasha 'rapes' a celebrity chef and he repays the compliment by later 'raping' her. It is a classic fable of modernity: lad girl/predator likes it when the man she has undermined turns on her because, in sexual terms, lad girl/predator likes a worthy competitor. </p> <p>'Many women fantasise about being dominated,' says the author, 'but I would only write such a thing in an appropriate context. I think it's really important to write in a way that does not demean women.' </p> <p>Flyte, 29, was born in Southend-on-Sea and read politics at Warwick University. Having worked in Asia for five years, she now lives in Tooting with her boyfriend. 'Most of my friends have read and enjoyed my work,' she says. 'I love telling strangers what I do just to see their faces!' </p> <p>She points out that the men who appear in her books tend to be the kind of men that she likes - that is, they are easy going, open minded and humorous. 'I'm not bothered by what men look like or how much they earn, so my characters tend not to have flash clothes or cars.' </p> <p>Asked if she thinks that erotic fiction is important, she says, 'It is when it shows women's sexuality in a positive light. Rather than portraying women as recipients or passive vessels, good erotic fiction explores their fantasies and show, them to be acceptable. How could this be a bad thing?' </p> <p> Last year, Sharp edited Wicked Words, a collection of erotic short stories that became the first British book to introduce slash lit to mainstream publishing. Slash lit was born at Star Trek conventions and then spread on the net in the Dark Ages when the web was first colonised by Trekkies and pornographers. Female dissidents met in a variety of virtual forums and posted short stories which appropriated mainstream sci-fi characters (in particular Captain Kirk and Spock) and placed them in a homoerotic context. Now a global phenomenon with an infrastructure of hundreds of sites and zines, slash sexualises everyone from Starsky and Hutch to Buffy and Xena. It is a world where a Dalek can date Captain Mainwaring and anything goes. </p> <p>The characteristics of slash fall in line with those demanded by any effective subversive activity. It is a means of expression for the individual (particularly those who feel marginalised); it is a way of undermining the hegemony of corporate concept; it is a completely new and innovative form of literature within the structure of an omnipotent technology; it operates, by and large, outside the demands of profit, which gives it freedom; it is egalitarian - anyone can post their work. </p> <p>Slash lit is the insubordinate's latest chapter to a history that not only relates an intimate relationship between erotica and subversion, but has also proved its political efficacy. The basic nature of slash fiction is illegal (no corporate publisher is going to print rude stories about another corporation's properties) and it is thus confined, but its links to erotic fiction are strong and represented by writers such as Kitty Fisher. Her short story 'Shadowlight' was modified for Black Lace, but reflects the traits of slash in that it is a sci-fi narrative about an affair between two men. </p> <p>Fisher, university educated, 40 years old and living in London, is bisexual and works in management. She has been involved with the slash-lit subculture for eight years and enjoys its renegade aspects. 'It is certainly part of the appeal for me. Going to a slash convention is still a bit like being part of a secret society - all these women from vastly different backgrounds sitting down to discuss whether Mulder would have better sex with Skinner or Krycek.' </p> <p>One of the characteristics of slash, which has yet to be adequately explained, is the fact that it is same-sex fiction (men with men, women with women) written by women for women. The anomalies of this are not simple: it is not just about lesbianism - heterosexual women are also involved. Why, then, are they both inspired and aroused by homo-erotica? This, of course, intrigues culture-studies types, who write long essays about complex pathologies, the creative implications of sexual guilt and the lack of female characters in popular culture. </p> <p>'I don't think any of the theories are quite right,' says Fisher. 'But I do think that women are only beginning to explore their sexuality.' </p> <p>Sharp has long been unafraid to engage herself as a pro-porn voice in the long-running debate that still severs feminist thinkers. 'It's time for women to make a friend of the word pornography,' she says. 'It doesn't have to be a pejorative term.' </p> <p>A couple of years ago she appeared on a David Frost programme and took on Catharine MacKinnon, the influential legal theorist who sees pornography as an engine of inequality that violates human rights. MacKinnon believes that the adult-entertainment industry should be made legally responsible for the damage it is causing. Sharp commented that by repudiating a woman's right to enjoy pornography, MacKinnon was denying the woman's right to have a sexuality, a point for which she received a round of applause from the audience. </p> <p>Sharp's politics were moulded in the mid-80s when, as a reaction against the 'awfulness' of Thatcherism, she became interested in the Socialist Workers' Party. 'I wouldn't dare admit to myself that the whole scene was dreary - those caucus meetings where you'd have Paul Foot and Tony Cliff and the guy who started Rock Against Racism, Paul somebody, who was a dish. But at the end of the day, you would have some terrible gentle beard in corduroys pressing your flesh and talking about Gramsci for 10 minutes. The imagination was not tolerated, there was no room for discussion, and there was no place for an alternative sexuality. It was the same with the unreconstructed feminism that was happening at the same time. It wasn't any fun.' </p> <p>Kerri Sharp's presence at Black Lace means that the imprint is more than a pulp factory churning out saucy books. She understands the subtle ebb and flow of sexual more and tends to steer her authors towards them; where once the narratives were full of pirates and Victorians, now they reflect the post-feminist paradoxes that exist within experimental sex, gender play, office politics and club culture. </p> <p>'The characters are getting older,' Tesni Morgan observes. 'Kerri thinks older women are more interesting...' </p> <p>As female writers continue to explore female sexuality, Black Lace works from within the system to disseminate messages about the joy of unashamed individualism. Ignored by reviews (a promotional tool that pulp fiction has never needed), the writers work in a world of their own. Creating their own cult heroines and spreading lubricious ideas about realistic possibilities, they are a fifth column percolating alternatives in an environment where the overall sexual perspective is still supervised by low-brow yobs.</p>",
  "<p>Tomorrow a quiet revolution will take place, the full repercussions of which are unlikely to become apparent for decades. Home Office Minister Barbara Roche, in a speech to the influential Institute For Public Policy Research think tank, will start a debate on the need to encourage more immigrant labour into this country. </p> <p>After all the xenophobia surrounding asylum seekers in recent months, Roche's attempt to stimulate a more rational, less incendiary debate is to be welcomed. </p> <p>The language she will use will be studious and cautious. This is a toe-dipping exercise, and the headlines in the right-wing press would make uncomfortable reading if she jumped in feet first. </p> <p>Nevertheless, this is a radical gesture: a tacit acknowledgement that Britain needs more immigrant workers, especially in information technology. A recent report by Arthur Andersen suggests that by 2002 there will be 80,000 unfilled vacancies in this sector in Britain. This is not a problem that will go away. After all, it's not as though we can borrow workers from our neighbours. Within three years Europe will be short of 1.7 million technology workers, according to analysts at IDC. </p> <p>The simple fact is that Western Europe has a declining and ageing population, and only dramatic changes to immigration policy will halt the slide. By 2050 there will be 40 million fewer people in the European Union if things continue as they are. This will have massive consequences for pensions and jobs. As we enter the knowledge economy, we have too many people in retirement and too few people working to pay their pensions. </p> <p>Coincidentally, the Government's attempts to examine the politically sensitive issue of immigration come as William Hague lays out his jazzy new blueprint for Britain's future. Hague's mini-manifesto,'Believing in Britain', unveiled last week, pledged to make this country nothing less than the tech nology capital of the world. This is the sort of brash claim we might expect from a 14 pints a day man, but unless the Tories change their attitude to immigration policy, it will never stack up. </p> <p>The manifesto's underlying philosophy is unashamedly American, stressing the need for more deregulation, competition and tax reforms in IT. </p> <p>But while the Conservatives kowtow to Uncle Sam, they seem reluctant to acknowledge how he got rich. The US's new-economy boom would have been impossible without immigrant labour. Around a third of Silicon Valley's scientific and engineering workforce is made up of immigrants. From the melting pot. Alchemy. </p> <p>And, of course, the influx of labour creates competition for jobs, which seals the lid on wage inflation. America's new paradigm? Alan Greenspan should give thanks to Bangalore and Hyderabad. </p> <p>This truth is something the Conservatives, and many others throughout the political spectrum, don't want to acknowledge. While they might look longingly at the economics of the new economy, its politics don't seem so popular. Yes, the argument seems to run, we like laissez- faire economics, but, gulp, not that laissez faire. </p> <p>And this is the nub. While everyone talks about the globalisation of business, few want to acknowledge the argument for the globalisation of labour. It seems paradoxical: capital is allowed to flow freely, but not workers. </p> <p>Of course there are genuine concerns about the movement of migrant labour. The brain-drain effect is a real concern for developing countries. But there is strong evidence that immigrant workers return to their native countries with experience learnt from abroad. And the old argument about foreign workers stealing the jobs of native employees is often false when it comes to highly skilled occupations. This is because countries currently fail to produce enough qualified workers to fill the gaps. </p> <p>Roche recently floated the idea of a \u00a310,000 goodwill bond for immigrant visitors from the sub-continent coming to Britain, to be forfeited if they overstayed. How long before immigrant workers ask Britain to do the same?</p>",
  "<p>Business folklore has it that when property developers unleash schemes so grandiose as to border on the absurd, it heralds the first sign of economic catastrophe. And they don't come much more grandiose than plans for a 1,200ft-high skyscraper next to London Bridge station. </p> <p>The man behind the London Bridge tower is Irvine Sellar, a colourful entrepreneur who personally lost \u00a330 million in 1991 when his former company went belly-up - a victim of double-digit interest rates, negative growth and the Gulf War. </p> <p>Sellar, who made his first fortune selling bell-bottom jeans on Carnaby Street, told The Observer that plans for what could be Europe's highest building will be submitted by the end of the year. It will cost \u00a3600m, but there's every chance that the 86-storey neck-strainer, 400ft higher than Canary Wharf, will rise next to the Thames in 2003. </p> <p>Planning authorities have encouraged Sellar to reach for the sky, and he claims that a mixture of his company's equity and debt from UK clearing banks will leave this lasting legacy on London's skyline. </p> <p>Now in his late fifties, Sellar endured sleepless nights when his company went bust. 'The memory and lessons of that time are indelibly printed on my mind,' he says. 'But I can't see any clouds on the horizon. I assume they're there though.' </p> <p>The project is one of an unprecedented number of ambitious skyscraper schemes. Birmingham, Leeds and Liverpool all want them, and 10 are mooted in London. </p> <p>Skyscrapers are the most obvious sign of a business community brimming with virile confidence. Today that confidence in property circles is based on the startling growth of office rents in central London: they have climbed by 30 per cent already this year, to an all-time record of \u00a380 a sq ft in London's Mayfair. Excited London surveyors now believe it won't be long before we see \u00a395 a sq ft. </p> <p>The rise has been caused by surging demand for space from dotcoms, from telecoms companies and from media and financial institutions, whose penchant for mergers has created the need for new offices. </p> <p>Consequently investors from Ireland, the US and the Middle East all want to buy into UK real estate. In the first six months of this year, a record \u00a33.6bn of commercial property changed hands in London alone, according to research from property consultant Knight Frank. This has yielded the Treasury and commercial lawyers about \u00a3100m each, from stamp duty and conveyancing fees, respectively. </p> <p>And still the party swings: a record number of offices are up for sale in the final quarter of this year. Prices may dip slightly, but that's due to the sheer weight of real estate coming on to the market. </p> <p>'We are six years into a period of sustained growth and I've never known an upturn to last this long,' says Michael Slade, chief executive of Helical Bar, one of the few quoted property companies respected by City institutions. 'But everything is focused on London and the South East. Labour will travel. People are commuting from Leicester to the Thames Valley every day. Computers and the IT revolution have finally hit home. You don't need provincial offices anymore. You just need to be close to where the action is.' </p> <p>There are those who say that a 50 per cent rise in construction starts this year signals that the property industry is overreaching itself. But what sent legendary figures such as Gerald Ronson, Godfrey Bradman and Stuart Lipton over the financial edge was loans secured on the basis of 'floating' interest rates. When a rise in those rates combined with a contracting economy, disaster struck. Today fixed-rate loans are the norm, and virtually every victim of the early Nineties recession is thriving. </p> <p>The property industry has engineered one of the most controlled and 'managed' property booms ever - capitalism at its most efficient. The instinct to build speculatively has been kept at bay, which means that should things turn nasty, there will be few property financial casualties. </p> <p>Most UK quoted property firms, whose shares are trading at an average 25 per cent discount to their net asset value, have this year been forced to shift focus to appeasing restless City investors. Companies such as MEPC, Prestbury and Green Properties have all left an unsympathetic stock market. Many others have launched share buy-back schemes to bolster performance. </p> <p>City concerns are heightened by the potential oil crisis and worries about whether London can remain a financial centre if it stays outside the eurozone. </p> <p>The talk in London is that there could soon be a shortage of land for new offices - hence the resurgence of towers. But still there is that nagging feeling that skyscrapers spell doom. How long will the wider business community be prepared to pay booming office rents? A camel's back can only take so much.</p>",
  "<p>Spike Lee has just made the most successful film of his career. It doesn't feature one of Denzel Washington's seemingly effortless portrayals of a complex, troubled man. Nor does it feature Lee's inventive use of colour, or an upside down camera, or references to the work of his heroes Wilder, Godard, Scorsese or Kazan. This time round, all Lee did was point a cheap video camera at a stage and record four guys talking. But if you look at the figures on a per cinema basis, Original Kings Of Comedy has outperformed most of the big summer hits. </p> <p>Maybe that isn't a surprise. After all the confused signals Hollywood has been picking up this summer - Are stars in or out? Are historical epics worth it (Gladiator) or possibly not (The Patriot) - one thing seems clear: black men being funny works. Big Momma's House featuring Martin Lawrence and Scary Movie, which starred and was written by Shawn and Marlon Wayans, have been unexpected blockbusters. And this in a summer when neither Will Smith nor aspirant superstar Chris Tucker had a film out. What's going on? </p> <p>Perhaps the best place to begin is Eddie Murphy's latest hit star vehicle, The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps, which reaches these shores in October. Not because the film has that much going for it: it's the usual mix of gooey good-heartedness and gross-out comedy, with the obesity of the Klump family (almost all played by Murphy) as the starting point for most of the jokes. But long before he re-emerged as a movie star with Nutty Professor, Murphy was a vital figure in the evolution of black comedy, both at his peak and because his career crisis prompted a search for the next Eddie Murphy which belatedly spawned this year's stars. </p> <p>Before Murphy, of course, there were Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor. Cosby was the original. In the early Sixties he was the first black stand-up to cross over to a mainstream (that's to say mainly white) audience. Inspired by him, Pryor started off with a similar vein of amiable humour. But he was a different kind of man, scarred by a horrendous childhood (he grew up a brothel). Liberated by the influence of Malcolm X and Lenny Bruce, he became an incendiary performer, brilliant but openly self-loathing. 'Pryor started everything. He's Yoda,' says Scary Movie director Keenan Ivory Wayans. </p> <p>That Pryor became seen as the anti-Cosby doesn't mean there was antagonism between the two: when they appeared together in California Suite (1978), Pryor insisted Cosby get paid equally with him. But while Cosby rarely ruffled his audiences, here's a Pryor joke at the expense of Martin Luther King: 'I have been to the mountain top too, and what did I see? More white people with guns.' </p> <p> But with a few exceptions - Blue Collar, Uptown Saturday Night, the script for Blazing Saddles - Pryor's film career never did justice to his talent. Yet despite massive drug abuse, he was hugely successful in the late Seventies, especially paired with Gene Wilder in Silver Streak (1976) and Stir Crazy (1980). In 1983, when the decline had set in, he was still getting paid more than Christopher Reeve to appear in Superman III. </p> <p>In those days Hollywood was willing to accommodate one famous funny black at a time (just as even today, executives are unsure that there is room for both Jennifer Lopez and Salma Hayek). So as Pryor stalled, Eddie Murphy rose. It's worth remembering just how big Murphy was at his peak: not just popular, around the time of Beverly Hills Cop (1984) he was as central to the feel of the mid-80s as Madonna or Prince or Miami Vice.</p> <p>His stage act, packed with four letter words and a rather insistent homophobia, was clearly influenced by Pryor, but coming from a stable middle-class background, he lacked the same inner rage. 'I've only been called \"nigger\" once in my life. There is very little anger in my humour,' he admitted. Murphy's hero, his obsession, turned out to be Elvis. But despite steering clear of drink and drugs, Murphy too found his career dipping violently in the late Eighties, mostly caused by an inability to chose decent films. </p> <p>In the short term the vacuum wasn't filled. But Murphy's Eighties superstardom, plus the memory of Pryor at his best, had inspired ambitious young black men to try comedy, and given the space to do so, especially on a couple of seminal TV shows. And it is that generation who are just reaching their peak now. Various Wayans brothers could be seen on In Living Color in the early Nineties. Most of the rest - including Chris Tucker and Martin Lawrence - appeared on Def Comedy Jam, which ran from 1993 to 1996. </p> <p>Many of them, including Lawrence, went down the sitcom route, but Tucker - a stand-up with a helium voice and a knack for physical comedy - was determined not to get stuck doing TV. The movies, he reasoned, were where the real stars were. He got his break when he starred with Ice Cube in the laidback 'hood comedy Friday . The film did OK in the cinemas but was hugely successful on video. Soon he was appearing in Luc Besson's deranged The Fifth Element and Tarantino's Jackie Brown, and co-starring with Charlie Sheen in Money Talks and Jackie Chan in Rush Hour. </p> <p>It was Rush Hour that made him a real star, one who can command the same kind of money that Eddie Murphy can. By doing The Fifth Element and by making a film with Chan, Tucker ensured he made a name in the vast film market outside the US, where black film stars usually struggle. So when he decided he wanted to make a film where he plays the first black president, Bill Clinton let him tag along for a few days. Which meant it was no surprise that Tucker gently declined Ice Cube's request that he appear in the sequel to Friday. Playing a neighbourhood slacker with a huge marijuana habit was no longer part of the plan (the film, incidentally, was a hit without him). </p> <p>Tucker talks about Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks as his inspirations. And why not? He doesn't come from the bullet-strewn streets of the South Bronx: he's from a middle class suburb of Atlanta. 'I always have thought in terms of the largest possible audience,' he says. 'I want everyone to relate to what I am doing. And that's been easy, because in my career I haven't experienced any racism.' </p> <p>You can hear the echoes of Murphy there. It is tempting to see traces of the Cosby-Pryor divide in the contrast between Chris Tucker and Chris Rock, not least because people often confuse the two. Rock is the opposite of Tucker in many ways: he's working class from Brooklyn, his comedy is entirely verbal, he likes working on TV, being a stand-up is more central to his career, and he doesn't see the world in colour-blind terms: his most recent TV special was called Bigger and Blacker. But, equally, Rock has pointed out that since only around 12 per cent of Americans are black, anyone who keeps it too 'real' is going to have a very limited career. His comedy idols included Woody Allen and Jerry Seinfeld as well as the inevitable Pryor, and his last two films have been for loquacious white directors Kevin Smith (Dogma) and Neil LaBute (Nurse Betty, released last week). </p> <p>But while Pryor and Cosby were effectively unchallenged, Rock and Tucker are far from alone. Big Momma's House was one of the most surprising successes of the summer. The star, Lawrence, shared equal billing with Will Smith (1993's Bad Boys) and Eddie Murphy (last year's Life). But only now has he reached the A-list. Big Momma's House is a terrible film, but like The Nutty Professor II, it uses the conceit of having a young-ish man play a fat, elderly woman. And that seems to go down endlessly well with the American public: Big Momma's House has picked up $119m, turning a tidy profit on its $30m budget. Some black commentators have worried that this film, and The Klumps, exploit fried chicken-chomping stereotypes. Spike Lee's next film, Bamboozled , attacks US television's predilection for lowbrow black comedy shows. But at the current level of success, Hollywood couldn't care less. </p> <p>There is a mystery underlying all this: comedy on US TV remains stubbornly segregated. Blacks won't watch Friends or Frasier, whites refused to watch Murphy's animated show The PJs. Martin Lawrence's sitcom Malcolm ran for four years without ever being a true mainstream success, while the Wayans brothers' TV show was cancelled not long before Scary Movie took off. </p> <p>The acts in Original Kings Of Comedy are also TV regulars, without troubling the higher reaches of the ratings. Is it that white America is happy to watch blacks on the big screen but not at home? It seems unlikely, considering Seventies hits such as Sanford and Son, Good Times and The Jeffersons, and more recently Will Smith's The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air, not to mention The Cosby Show. </p> <p>No one has figured that out yet. But what is certain is that whether they blandly insist that 'funny is funny' like Tucker, or extract comedy from the difference between blacks and whites like the guys in Original Kings Of Comedy, the film industry is finally ready to accept more than one funny black guy at a time. </p> <p>\u0095 Nutty Professor II: The Klumps opens 6 October</p>",
  "<p>There is a line in Muriel Spark's new novel, Aiding and Abetting (her twenty-first) which gave me a shock of recognition when I read it, so neatly might it apply to the author herself: '[She] had long felt that sentimentality was a luxury she could not afford.' </p> <p>'It could be true.' Dame Muriel rearranges herself on the sofa and considers. 'I have sometimes thought that.' </p> <p>Others have noted it too, over her 50-year writing career, this lack of sentiment, and have called it coldness or ruthlessness. Miss Jean Brodie called it dedication ('You must all grow up to be dedicated women,' she tells her girls). Spark's co-religionist and former patron Graham Greene pinpointed the same quality in different words: 'There is a splinter of ice in the heart of a writer.' </p> <p>In person, she is charming, with shrewd, smiling eyes and careful, dark-red lipstick that matches her hair. She offers me coffee, invites me to admire the exuberant flowers her publisher has sent to cheer up the small room of her genteel hotel, is very concerned with my tape recorder and whether it's working properly. She might be 82, but don't make the mistake of talking to her as if she's an old lady. </p> <p>'Do you get to travel much these days?' I realise before I've finished the question how patronising it sounds. Spark draws herself up slightly and replies: 'This is my third trip to London this year and I'm coming back in October. But we nearly didn't get here because of those French fishermen.' </p> <p>Sitting across from her, leafing through recent reviews and cuttings, is Penelope Jardine, Spark's friend and companion of more than 20 years; it is Penelope who does the driving to and from the converted Tuscan presbytery they share when not travelling, and Penelope who, rather like Mrs Tennyson, takes care of the practical side of life while Spark is writing and researching, Penelope who types up Spark's manuscripts, all written in long-hand in special notebooks she orders from the Edinburgh stationer James Thin.</p> <p>Occasionally, Spark appeals to Penelope to corroborate a story or back up an opinion - 'I think it's not as hard for women writers to get noticed these days - what do you think, Pen? You always say women writers have a bad deal.' 'Do I?' 'Yes, you do.' </p> <p>'Someone's got you down here as a single mother,' Penelope remarks, looking up from her cuttings, 'meaning you weren't married when you had a baby.' </p> <p>'Well, I was virtually a single mother,' Spark cries, indignantly, 'he was absolutely abandoned by his father!' </p> <p>Her critics might find this accusation a little disingenuous. Spark's relationship with her son, Robin, appears always to have been unorthodox. Her husband, Sydney Oswald, whom she married at 19 having emigrated to join him in Rhodesia, began to show signs of mental illness not long after the child's birth and was eventually interned in an institution; Muriel filed for divorce and, keen to experience the war in Europe at first-hand, left little Robin in a convent while she braved the voyage back to England on a troop ship. When her son joined her the following year, he went to live with her parents in Edinburgh, while Spark continued her war work for the Foreign Office, broadcasting subtle anti-Nazi propaganda and false information to German troops. </p> <p>She was writing poetry in Rhodesia, but her literary career was launched in 1951, when she submitted a short story to a competition in The Observer and won first prize out of nearly 7,000 entries. 'You had to send it under a pseudonym,' she remembers, 'and put your real name inside. It was Philip Toynbee who opened it, and he was quite surprised to find that it was by a woman. I don't know if that's a compliment or not. But that was a great moment. The New Yorker gave me a party.' </p> <p>A publishing contract followed, and Spark's career took her to New York. But the relationship with her son attracted attention again two years ago, when Robin, an artist and an Orthodox Jew who still lives in Edinburgh, suddenly flourished his grandparents' marriage certificate which, he claimed, disproved Muriel's assertion that her mother was not Jewish. Muriel, naturally, countered with characteristic energy and defiance; a letter of 1998 to The Observer begins: 'Your report (last week) that I \"finally conceded\" that I was not born of a Jewish father and a Gentile mother, is wrong. I conceded no such thing. I do not need to prove anything, anyway.' </p> <p>'My mother falsified the marriage certificate so she could be married in a synagogue,' she says, her tone somewhere between weariness and protestation. 'I can't help it that she wasn't a Jew. When my son started playing up, I gave his letters to the National Library of Scotland, who handle my manuscripts. I think it's only right that people should know the truth, and his letters speak for themselves.' </p> <p>Perhaps Robin felt his mother was threatening the identity he had painstakingly constructed? </p> <p>'He thought I should have gone along with it and covered up,' she says, really quite affronted. 'I'd have done anything to make him a full Jew, but I wasn't going to lie! But I think he got annoyed because I pointed out that he was just pure damn jealous - he was very resentful of my success.' </p> <p>Identity is a crucial theme for Spark; you can imagine she would be resentful of anyone who tried to rewrite her own past. 'I'm a Catholic,' she says, 'but if people attack the Jews, then I do feel very Jewish. I think environment is the provocation.' </p> <p>She returns to the theme of literary success and jealousy. 'I'm a very bad picker of men. Obviously I didn't pick my son, but weak men can't cope with women who are successful, particularly if you're a writer, because your heart is always with the work, you exclude them. I've made three terrible mistakes - well, one was my husband and he was bonkers, so you can't count him. But the other two were writers, and they couldn't cope with my doing better than them. If you don't want that sort of treatment you should pick men who are more ambitious.' </p> <p>I'm nodding, perhaps too vigorously, and her eyes turn suddenly sharp. 'Are you married?' I tell her I'm not. 'Well, not to worry, you've plenty of time.' She smiles, with a touch of benevolence. It seems a curious comment from someone who speaks of her own marriage as 'disastrous', never considered remarrying and tells, quite matter-of-factly, of having had 'lots of affairs'. I ask how she endeavours to keep in touch with new generations of readers. </p> <p>'Ah, one can never be sure of that. You can only hope for the best - the thing is not to bore myself. I watch television, so I do know what's going on. We have Sky News, CNN and BBC World,' she says, proudly. </p> <p>She also reads contemporary fiction, when it's sent her way. On the coffee table is a proof of Toby Litt's forthcoming novel. 'Do you know this writer? Terribly good. Word of mouth matters more than reviews.' </p> <p>But does her semi-reclusive life in Italy mean that she is now obliged to draw on past experience and memory for her fiction? 'I've often wondered that - am I just left with my past? But no - the next novel I'm writing has nothing to do with my past. Well, only in the way that everything draws on your past to an extent, but this is a totally new thing.' </p> <p>It's only when a tentative boy arrives with more flowers that I glance at my watch and realise we've been talking for half an hour past the allotted time. 'Now that we've met,' she says, getting to her feet, 'you must come and visit us in Italy, we'd love that, wouldn't we, Pen?' Dame Muriel may not be sentimental, she may be single-minded, unflinching and possessed of a wit that slices like cheesewire, but her splinter of ice is hidden under a warm and generous exterior.</p>",
  "<p>Estonia is a paradox: young, free and modern, but with a pagan soul. What good-time boy could resist a brew of heaving bars, beauteous nymphs, devilish revels and wild nights, not forgetting hairy beasts? No wonder the Tartan Army feels at home. </p> <p>As a child, I had looked through enough old atlases and stamp collections to know that Estonia is not, as many seem to believe, in the Balkans, but not much more. One guidebook advises visitors to bring their own condoms, another to bring Mace to fend off stray dogs while jogging in the suburbs. I found a little poem by the renowned Estonian poet, Juhan Liiv: </p> <p> You are too little <br> Little to be seen <br> To be known <br> To be felt <br> You are a little land <br> Little your speech <br> You have an indrawn heart <br> They cannot reach. </p> <p>Estonia is not that small, actually: it's bigger than Switzerland, consisting of a sizeable chunk of the Northern European mainland plus well over a thousand islands. But it does boast one of the world's smallest population densities. It shares the Baltic Sea with Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Germany. It has the same latitude as the northernmost tip of Scotland. Estonia emerged from the chaos of the First World War and the turmoil of Russian revolution as a highly literate country gaining its independence for the first time in 700 years. </p> <p>The recently formed Estonian Airlines flight from Gatwick provided excellent food and service.Although smoking was not allowed, nicotine chewing gum of various strengths was thoughtfully provided. I was reading the in-flight magazine and strategically seated next to a fluently English-speaking Estonian beauty called Monica. An old lad's research prospects had never looked brighter. </p> <p>Estonians are thought to be glum, pessimistic, stubborn, secretive, narrow (if not closed) minded, self-absorbed, unable to smile, brusque, and are expected to be so because of the long, dark mini-Ice Age winters and constant interrogations by the Gestapo and the KGB. 'May your face be as ice,' is an understandable and sensibly held motto. </p> <p>None of this seemed to apply to Monica, with whom I struck up a conversation. She explained how Estonian independence lasted a mere 20 years and had been followed by half a century of Soviet occupation. The Soviets committed their standard catalogue of atrocities - secret murders, executions without trial, mass deportations, exile to Siberian prison camps, the ruthless destruction of cemeteries, national treasures and cultural memories. Even Father Christmas and privately owned windmills were abolished. All phone calls and mail had to be routed through Moscow. The Estonian national anthem was forbidden, and people were sent to Siberia for singing it. However, it was played on Finnish TV and radio, which could be covertly picked up. </p> <p>Monica's eyes welled with the tears of painful memories. I tactfully changed the subject. </p> <p>'Why do lads like Tallinn so much, Monica?' </p> <p>She had no idea what I meant. My 20-minute summary of lad culture did nothing to improve her understanding, but she did infer the requirement of hedonism. </p> <p>'Presumably, these lads like to sing?' </p> <p>'Lads do quite like singing, yes.' </p> <p>'Then it's easy. To have a good time in Estonia, you must go to the country, to the moonlight parties in the woods. Dance back to health. Sing away your sorrows. Drink and be merry. I suggest the island of Saaremaa. I have a summer-house there. Here is my mobile.' </p> <p>The next morning, I made a sightseeing tour of the capital. Built as a fort, a marketplace and a port, Tallinn is a jumble of contradictions, with its winding, cobbled streets, hidden courtyards, open-air markets and theatres, gingerbread fa\u00e7ades, and quirky defensive walls forming an intact medieval city encircled by tree-lined avenues, a belt of parks, a cluster of Soviet-era buildings, and the Baltic Sea. In the heart of the Old Town are pool bars, bowling alleys and subterranean 10,000-watt discos with all the lights. </p> <p>Previously neglected monastic buildings have been turned into student caf\u00e9s. Some establishments offered private striptease. Dimly lit cigar lounges enticed secret smokers. Hundreds of restaurants offered cuisines from dozens of nationalities. There were biker bars with real bikers, and country bars without country music. </p> <p>The Russians, in their 50-year occupation, painted buildings to achieve an inner-city drab uniformity, turned the churches into sterile museums and offices, and renamed streets after Russian military heroes. Now the paint is being peeled away, constantly revealing scenes of multi-coloured medieval merriment. I peeped inside an Orthodox church where a wedding and a funeral were simultaneously taking place in front of bemused Japanese tourists. </p> <p>I stumbled into haunted houses with heavily documented apparitions of crucified monks and black dogs with burning eyes. One house claimed to be the site of the Devil's wedding and subsequent reception; the clinking glasses could be heard all night. A well sits in the middle of a cobbled street. Food is thrown down to appease the goblin that lives at the bottom. Goblins and devils were more real in this city then in any other I've visited. Paganism is clearly alive and well. But where were the lads? </p> <p>A cursory glance around the Old City clearly showed that the main entertainment is, indeed, liquid. The many varieties of Estonian beer are first-class. During the thirteenth century, bishops demanded beer as payment for taxes. Fines and sacrifices were also paid in beer, and brewing beer was obligatory on holidays. When sailors brought back potatoes from America, the idea of vodka was quickly and sensibly conceived. And the best beer and vodka in Estonia come from Saaremaa, the island of the wood nymph with the mobile, the island where, during the Soviet occupation, no foreigner was allowed to visit, the island where enforced isolation preserved the traditions and culture of Old Estonia. I decided to forget the lads and head for Saaremaa. </p> <p>Renting a car was surprisingly cheap and easy, and the roads were very visitor-friendly and empty. Hitchhiking is actively encouraged, so I filled up the car with the first four thumb-wavers I encountered. They made helpful guides and informed me of the weird sports that have become popular in Estonia. These included wife-carrying races, mobile-phone throwing, and Keekiin (swinging in vertical circles). </p> <p>The beauties of the countryside are subtle and delicate. Half the country is covered with primeval forests, which yield to deep peat bogs, vast swamps, wild fens, misty marshes, sparkling lakes and rivers, and long and lonely sandy coastlines. We took a 30-minute ferry ride to Muhu, an island joined by causeway to Saaremaa. Tourism provides a welcome income here. Everything is available for those who believe active holidays restore creative powers: water sports, hiking, hunting, cycling, canoe trips and horse-riding. </p> <p>We passed through popular spa areas, where the locals have had centuries of experience with the curative properties of the shoreline mud. For those of us perfectly healthy but thoroughly inactive, roadside notices advertise fishing, open-air museums, and berry and mushroom picking. My passengers assured me that picking mushrooms could be a dangerous business for a visitor not accompanied by an Estonian able to distinguish the edible, the poisonous and those that render the consumer temporarily bananas. </p> <p>We got out of the car and rambled through the forest. It felt like being let loose in a safari park. Estonia has more large wild mammals than anywhere else in Europe. My fellow pickers claimed to see brown bears, elk, deer, wild boar, wolves and lynx. Earlier, we had definitely seen beavers, seals and otters, as well as black storks, sea swans and golden eagles. We filled a bag with berries and mushrooms, and I ate some. On the walk back, we passed the eerie 8,000-year-old meteorite crater of Kaali, where in Scandinavian mythology the sun has its grave. I wondered what secrets of the past were hidden here. An elderly gentleman approached me. </p> <p>'Are you from Scotland?' </p> <p>'No. I'm from a similar country called Wales.' </p> <p>'I study unidentified objects, you see, and I want to go to Loch Ness.' </p> <p>The sun was beginning to set as we drove to the Illiku Ladu summer disco. It would soon open its doors. There would then be a moonlight party in the woods. Assuming (even if hoping otherwise) that the mushrooms I'd wolfed were of the non-psychoactive variety, I joined the festivities and sampled extensively the local brews and spirits. Several hours of heavy drinking later, I was unable to determine if my assumption had been correct. We were in a sacred oak grove with totem pole-like energy columns beaming out waves of psychic rejuvenation. It was a bonfire-lit night of magic and sorcery with naked witches running through the trees, casting their spells. </p> <p>It was a night when dawn, furiously and swiftly, embraced the dusk. It was a night for boozing, a night for music, and a night for lovers. We adorned crowns of leaves, sported garlands of flowers, grasses, and herbs to ward off (or, in my case, encourage) those naughty wood nymphs. On ropes hung from trees, we swung over bonfires. We bathed in the magical, wrinkle-removing dew. The only forbidden activity was sleeping, punishable by a year's bad luck. I felt safe. </p> <p>Back in Tallinn, the city was heaving with laughing drinkers. A bar called Molly Malone's was crammed but no one was Irish. This was made clear by the presence of what had to be all the blonde contestants of Ms World, the attire worn by each male boozer (kilt, sporran and beret), and the tune being sung - 'Doh, a deer, a female deer'. I had walked into the temporary headquarters of the Tartan Army, Scotland's football fans. As far as laddish behaviour goes, the Tartan Army are pretty hard to beat. Chas, the head barman (a Scot), recognised me. 'That was all British and American propaganda, wasn't it, Howard?' said Chas, surrounded by hand-picked, beautiful barmaids. </p> <p>'What do you mean?' </p> <p>'You know. All that bollocks about women in the Soviet countries being fat and ugly.' </p> <p>'Why are the Scots here, Chas?' </p> <p>'Well, the owner of Molly Malone's is a Scot, and Scotland are playing Latvia on Saturday. Whenever Scotland are playing anywhere in or fairly near to Estonia, they always spend a few nights here in Tallinn. It's become a tradition.' </p> <p>The reasons are interesting. The region's worst maritime disaster outside of war was the 1994 sinking of the Estonia, a ferry operating between Stockholm and Tallinn. More than 800, including 500 Estonians, lost their lives. Some Scottish football fans, who had travelled on that same route, were so moved that they raised funds for the surviving families and presented the cheque to the Estonian embassy in London. </p> <p>A year later, Scotland were playing Estonia away. The Tartan Army's first act was to visit Tallinn's memorial to the deceased. Led by a lone piper, they marched through the streets and paid tribute with flowers. The fans were officially given the freedom of the city. The floodlights of Tallinn's small stadium had gone badly wrong, so the match was brought forward to be played in daylight. The Estonian team was too far out of town to get there in time, so Scotland marched on to the pitch alone. Six hundred members of the Tartan Army stood in the stands, otherwise empty, apart from the Estonian army who were filling in for the security men. Scotland played for a few seconds, walked off, and hit the town, to be joined later by the tardy Estonian team. </p> <p>The revelry was unprecedented and unsurpassed. Word gets around. Many fans return for weekend benders well outside the football season. They are complimented for their behaviour. A raggle-taggle mob of crazily dressed, skint people bevvying and swearing are not the usual criteria of civic order. But with Estonia and the Tartan Army, it's true love. </p> <p>Estonians are far from prudish. They excel in mockery of state authority. Their folk heroes never become kings; they talk philosophy with the Devil, then double-cross him. </p> <p>I shall definitely return.

  "<p>Mallorca is an island celebrated for its beauty. I've been there a few times and know all about the fertile valleys, scenic mountains, shady citrus groves, fine restaurants and picturesque villages. Yet somehow, up till now, I' d never managed to see any of it. </p> <p>Mallorca - or Majorca, as we called it then - was where we took our first family holiday abroad. I was 14 and it was heaven, a two-week package of sun, sea, sangria, hotel discos and all-you-can-eat BBQ excursions. We didn't see a great deal of the island, but my parents came back to Birmingham with the copy of 'Y Viva Espana' they' ve played at every family get-together since and I flew home feeling worldly and sophisticated with a sombrero on my head and a 3ft high plastic donkey on my lap. It was, we all agreed, a perfect holiday. </p> <p>Later, I came back with friends from the club world to visit BCM in Magaluf, Europe's biggest disco and a regular summer stopover for British DJs. The hospitality of the club' s manager, Toni Palmer, is legendary, and his guests always end up going to bed early. Usually a day or two after they first enter his establishment. So it is that I know more about Magaluf bar life than is perhaps healthy or desirable and am also familiar with a handful of charming after-hours clubs and bars in the island's capital, Palma. I've even staggered into the cathedral there once, admiring the Gothic architecture and examining in a dazed and confused way the rather peculiar altar added by Antoni Gaud\u00ed before wandering off for some long overdue sleep. </p> <p>But this time, things were going to be different. This time, we had our four-year-old son and an air-conditioned Volvo that was a pleasure to drive. Finally, we were going to explore Mallorca. And after the gaudy bustle of Magaluf, the first revelation was our tranquil base on the south-east coast. Porto Petro is the kind of place brochures still like to call 'a sleepy fishing village', although it is now more a marina for tourist sailing boats, surrounded by restaurants with menus in several languages. But it's protected from over-development by its lack of beach and our villa stood on a quiet, pine-shaded road that was only a short walk from the waterside but felt like a private retreat. </p> <p>For the first few days, we barely strayed from the safe, sandy twin coves of nearby Cala Mondrago. We drove, but a van pulled a cute little tourist 'train' through the resorts strung along this part of the coast several times a day, ferrying its red-skinned cargo to the beaches. Mondrago is its last stop and also the prettiest. Both of its beaches had clear, clean water shelving gently into the sea. The closer of the two boasted a big restaurant pumping out loud music and an endless supply of chips, bumper-to-bumper sunbeds and children splashing in and out of the sea while screaming loudly in a variety of languages. The other beach, accessed along a long concrete path, was far more peaceful, with only a small booth serving drinks and hiring out sun-beds. (No prizes for guessing which one our son preferred.) </p> <p>Lunch came most days from a man selling melon, pineapple and coconut on the beach, all of which he' d expertly cut using a lethal-looking machete. Children who you suspect never touch fruit at home queued to buy from him and our son developed a taste for watermelon that has lasted long after the holiday ended. At night we ate at first in the excellent restaurants overlooking Porto Pedro' s marina. The lobster we ordered one night was delicious but took well over an hour to arrive: great if you' re sharing a bottle of wine or two with friends; an eternity if you're trying to entertain a small boy who cannot understand why food should ever take longer than a Big Mac and fries. </p> <p> At home, one of our solutions to the fast food versus good food conundrum is tapas: the food comes quickly, there' s endless variety and lots of different things for picky kids to try. But in Mallorca, the problem was finding it. Only one place in Porto Petro claimed to serve tapas, but their technique of coating every ingredient in thick batter before chucking it into the deep-fat fryer for what seemed like an hour owed more to Scottish chip shops than Spanish bars. Along the coast we found wood-fired pizzerias, an Italian ice-cream parlour, German-run cafes - but no tapas. </p> <p>So we drove around the island. A restaurant in a back-street in the north-west resort of Port de Pollen\u00e7a offered a delicious bread-and-vegetable stew as part of a ridiculously cheap set lunch. A caf\u00e9 at the Mirador de ses Barques up in the mountains had cold drinks and breathtaking views down to the sea. Down among the citrus groves by S\u00f3ller, we drank a fresh orange juice at a table shaded by the trees the fruit had been picked from. But by tapas-time, the culinary trail had grown cold. The day-trippers had left and lovely Dei\u00e0 seemed to have closed for the night, so we drove on and finally ended up in a promising-looking bar opposite the church in nearby Calvi\u00e0 with a cold beer and a plate of assorted mashed vegetable bits that was called tapas but looked more like something you see thrown up in the gutter in Magaluf after the bars have closed. </p> <p>It was the end of the week before we left the beach again and ventured into Palma. It is a beautiful city, interesting and easy to walk around with fantastic shops and delis, extravagant turn-of-the-century modernista exteriors, caf\u00e9s in shady squares selling excellent food and coffee at a fraction of the price of the resorts. And it was at the end of the day here that we finally found our perfect tapas. There are plenty of establishments along or around Passeig d'es Born and Avinguda d'Antoni Maura serving fresh snacks at the bar or at little Formica tables and I'd like to tell you we found a hidden gem among those. But our son was tired and hungry, so we chose El Pilon from the Rough Guide To Mallorca . Judging by the testimo nials on the wall outside in Calle can Cifre, the authors weren't sharing a secret either: most of the guidebooks in Europe seem to list this dark, cramped little establishment. </p> <p>It's easy to see why. When we arrived just at opening time, the staff were still enjoying a drink together at one of the back tables, and although they gestured us to sit and wait, our arrival did nothing to hurry the three men through an evening ritual they looked as if they had enjoyed together for many years. Later, when the place was full, they moved effortlessly around each other in the tiny cooking area stuffed behind the bar, dancers in a ballet choreographed by only time; the chef occasionally pulled a ladder out from above the cooker and hoisted his bulky form effortlessly up into the roof to bring down pots or ingredients, the two waiters stepped elegantly around him and a vast array of dishes were cooked and served from the tiny kitchen with a minimum of fuss. </p> <p>The drama came from the locals who popped by for a drink, leaning against the bar while shouting, gesticulating and theatrically sharing the day's news. ('Are they fighting?' asked our son anxiously.) </p> <p>While we tucked in to tender grilled squid, garlic prawns, lemony sardines, vegetables so delicately fried they could have been tempura and a fine selection of breads, cheeses and salads, he picked at choice morsels and enjoyed the cabaret the waiters laid on especially for him. Between memorising and delivering long orders to and from the crowded tables, assembling dishes, flirting with a table of black-clad matrons and catching up with the gossip at the bar, our waiter managed to fish a live lobster out of the tank by the door for our child to examine, and keep up complicated games of tickling, chasing and face-pulling that kept him fully amused for an hour. This is what I've come to love about eating out in Mediterranean countries: children are a natural part of the process, not ignored, tolerated or catered to with separate menus. </p> <p>Flying home we all agreed that Mallorca is indeed beautiful. We hadn't bought a donkey or even seen a sombrero, but 25 years after my first trip there, the island can still provide the perfect family holiday. </p> <p>\u0095 Sheryl Garratt's visit to Mallorca was arranged by Meon Villas (01730 230370). She stayed at the four-star Casa Baskings in Porto Petro where prices start at \u00a3432 per person for one week (based on six sharing). This includes flights from Gatwick, welcome pack, twice-week maid service and car with unlimited mileage.</p>",

This long quasi-narrative poem follows the movement of the painter Camille Pissarro from his birthplace in St Thomas through to the firmament of Impressionist Paris, and the poet's own artistic and creative quest. In it we move with the narrator in an exploration of artistic awakening, and processes that parallel and connect with those of the artist. </p> <p>This is a complex work about identity, place and time and the problems of reading history and empire ('He was Art's subject as much as any empire's') through the narrative we construct out of memory. The guilt of leaving, the guilt of betrayal, and of self-justification, burn as background. The political points are there ('We are history's afterthought'), but their presentation lacks vitality. </p> <p>Attempts to segue speech and writing into the field of the canvas as well as the page, to examine the rebus nature of visual thought, become repetitive and overplayed. Walcott doesn't do metatext and self-referential poetry particularly well. We get too much of this: 'the stroke, the syllable, planted in the furrows of page and canvas, in varnished pews...' It goes on and on: 'its apostrophe/poised like a gull' and 'My pen replaced a brush'. </p> <p>There is often interesting palimpsesting of places, and the play on the doubt of the apostle St Thomas, on the artist (and poet's) self-doubt, is in tension with a secular reading of the world. In the poetry itself, there is none of the excitement that the narrator senses on first glimpsing the 'vermilion light in a hound's thigh'. The movement through memory, place, and history, is steady rather than emphatic, but there is a deft awareness of the limitations of art: 'except Time is not/narrative'. </p> <p>Clearly, the versifying is the work of a craftsman - the pentameter rolls across the page, the interconnected couplets rhyming abab to maintain the narrative flow without closing off as traditional heroic couplets might; but there is a lack of vitality that, on occasions, drags the work into the doldrums. The Walcott paintings included with the text are competent, but as dated and drab as the verse technique, and their inclusion bewildering except in terms of the aims of a gift book. </p> <p>It would be nice to see more rage and less quiet. Stillness and poise and grace centre the European eye - a more persistent paranoid vision might better reveal the deep obfuscations and abstractions that inform the great wrongs of colonial history, the evils of false social contracts. Walcott knows this well. </p> <p>And he knows about the fragility of authority and the narrative voice: 'My inexact and blurred biography is like his painting; that is fiction's treason to deny fact, alter topography to its own map...'. Not a masterpiece, but had it been half the length and a little more intense both in form and language, it might well have been. </p> <p>John Burnside has the potential to produce a masterpiece. His language usage is recognisably his own, and his sense of the line is accomplished. His new volume <strong> The Asylum Dance</strong> carries a number of flawed and indifferent poems, but, in the main, is a stunning manual of the lyrical art. While Pissarro guides Walcott, it's Munch that Burnside summons up. </p> <p>This is a book of half-lights, wraiths and ghosts. It's the in-between world of 'presence' and 'absence', concepts that in some ways correlate to Gerard Manley Hopkins's 'inscape' and 'instress', but in the main capture an ambivalence, an edginess between the real and imagined, the at-home and wandering.</p> <p>The apparently straightforward lyric is underpinned by cerebral concerns about the way language works. For all its poise and control, this is a book of guilt and pain. The reader is taken on dark dances along the edge, the place between home and away: 'In school we were taught to admire the homing instinct, animate and sharp behind the eyes ignoring this vast delight, this useless motion.' Certain words occur in poem after poem - 'ghost', 'snow' (as guilt and purity), 'traces', and so on. </p> <p>The book builds like therapy. There is a need for security but a hungering for instability. This transforms most often into the geographic, but centres on relationships: 'and I waited for my father to begin unravelling like twine'. Tensions abound. You can draw schematic diagrams over the pages of this book. Between the Pagan and God, the purgatorial and the preordained, the 'hints and traces' of other possible lives, the lists of objects and plants. Lists anchor identity, give the stability that's craved and rejected. 'Ports', 'The Hay Devil', 'Roads', 'Fields', and the title poem are astonishing works. In these poems, nothing is as simple as believing or not believing. </p> <p>Sharon Olds's <strong> Blood, Tin, Straw</strong> continues the themes she has explored in her previous books. Explorations of the self through sexuality, familial relationships, and the exposition of the private, feed these poems, divided into five sections - the three of the title plus 'Fire' and 'Light'. There are some vintage Olds poems in there, but the language rarely lifts off the page. </p> <p>If Olds's poetry is confessional, it's of the variety that is about 'witness' more than locating the authentic self. There are poems of escape: 'I want to be a baby,/I want to be small and naked...'; of love-hate filial relationships: 'but my sperm king/fished me back, and gave me to my mother/to strip and towel-dry, to burnish'; and sex. The associations between sexual pleasure, need, crisis, death, and birth, are unrelenting. The highlight of the volume comes with Olds's self-ironising (or defensiveness) in 'Take The I Out': ' ...I love the I, frail between its flitches, its hard ground and hard sky, it soars between them like the soul that rushes, back and forth, between the mother and the father'.</p>",
  "A few years ago there were 18 revenue-funded black and Asian theatre companies in Britain. These included small, local groups, established touring companies such as Temba, and the Black Theatre Season in London. Today there is only one black company (Nitro) funded by the Arts Council of England (ACE), and one black company (Talawa) funded by the London Arts Board (LAB). In the regions, things are even worse. <p>Unemployment, a regular companion for anyone working in the theatre, is now a constant and bosom com panion of most black theatre workers. So much so that many writers, actors, technicians and directors are driving mini cabs, or have gone into teaching or some other occupation. Some of the best have left the country. </p> <p>Generally, white theatres do not employ black people, nor do they have a policy of programming black productions. Notable exceptions are the Tricycle Theatre in Kilburn, and the Theatre Royal, Stratford East. Surprisingly, the Royal National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company have a good history of employing black actors - and in recent years, to play significant roles. But it is worth noting there is not a single non-white artistic director in any theatre in the UK. What we have is an industry that is institutionally racist to its very core, yet congratulates itself on being super-liberal. </p> <p>I am artistic director of Carib Theatre Company; this was a small, black-managed company receiving \u00a325,000 from LAB, \u00a310,000 from London Borough Grants Scheme and nothing from ACE. In biblical style - those that have shall receive and those that haven't shall have taken from them - our grant was taken from us by LAB and LBGS and given to white companies. </p> <p>This followed an established pattern. When I was a drama advisor at LAB two things became apparent to me: 1) Black theatre companies were being dropped out of the funding system, and 2) equal opportunity policies of most revenue-funded clients were being ignored. At Advisory Board meetings I started asking questions about these two issues. The questions were never answered. But obviously I was being annoying. Interviews with the press, plus a speech I made accusing the funding bodies of racism, sealed the fate of my company. </p> <p>Six months later, Carib Theatre was cut, no reason given other than they were having a kind of general clean-out. The fact that Carib was a highly successful company, having produced plays such as The Amen Corner by James Baldwin and Remembrance by Derek Walcott, and had been consistently commended by LAB for the excellence of our work (especially in schools, where we had performed to more than 30,000 London schoolchildren) obviously cut no ice. </p> <p>The curious thing is that none of the people in any of these institutions are racist. I have never met a racist in the Arts Council, LAB, or working at any theatre. I can only imagine that racism is so entrenched that people don't recognise it for what it is. Or they do recognise it but can't be bothered to tackle it, deeming it unimportant. This attitude is a reflection of our society. Start talking about racism and people's eyes begin to glaze over. Most white people are just not interested. It does not concern them. They will never be victims of it. They will have more sympathy if you have the flu, because they can identify with that, but there is no danger of them ever turning black. They are completely immune. </p> <p>But the reality for me and every black person in Britain is that I may be stabbed, lynched, doused with petrol and set alight, thrown from a bridge, kicked and beaten to death, die in police custody, or suffer any other number of horrors solely because of the colour of my skin. All of the above have happened to black people here in the last two or three years. Britain certainly is not as bad as some other countries. But that is still no excuse for people to tolerate racism. If you tolerate racism, it means you are supporting racism. </p> <p>So while racism thrives in society at large, we should not be surprised that it is alive and well in the theatre. (As for television, God help us.) What to do about it? First, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport must see to it that the Arts Council and the Regional Arts Boards put their own houses in order. It is then for those bodies to rigorously monitor the implementation of equal opportunity policies for every organisation receiving public funding. </p> <p>More immediately, what the black theatre sector needs is money. Not just the money which was taken away from us (that was wholly inadequate anyway), but money which will make a real and permanent differ ence to the sector. It would be good to have even one theatre under black management; several would be better. The lottery has provided hundreds of millions of pounds for the arts, yet here too we have been neglected. In fact, without our own buildings we will always be marginalised. </p> <p>Equally important, we need the black companies back. It is they who examine the concerns, aspirations, history, culture, relationships and conflicts of black people. There is a large black audience out there who want to see their lives reflected on the stage. There is also a large white audience who have attended our plays, and who have been educated and entertained by them. It is the black companies who should have what the Americans call 'first voice' in matters concerning black people. If there is a will, we can begin to change things today, right now. Is anyone still listening?</p>"
