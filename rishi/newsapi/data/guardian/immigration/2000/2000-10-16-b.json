  "<p>New Contemporaries is an annual exhibition selected from the work of students and graduates of fine art degree courses in the UK. Hosted by the Cornerhouse for the sixth year running, the 33 successful artists have been chosen by Sarah Kent, visual arts editor of London magazine Time Out, Jeremy Millar, a freelance curator, and artist Gavin Turk. Damien Hirst, a previous New Comtemporaries exhibitor, is one of the project's patrons. </p> <p>Much of the work here seems to harbour a fascination with urban-pastoral landscapes or concepts. Can we take the city to the country and vice versa? Josephine Butler's huge atmospheric photographs of peaty groves could depict October days in any rural area, but she tells us in the title that they are all somewhere in the City of London. With the industrial detritus of bricks, hose-pipes, buckets and glass, James Ireland sets up Tableau, a DIY waterfall, cheekily based on an accompanying photograph of the real thing. </p> <p>Beata Veszley, meanwhile, brings animals to the city by constructing five life-size plastic horse-heads replete with manes and glass eyes. She mounts these on wooden poles and the viewer is encouraged to step inside the cast and wear one like a mask. If you're with a friend, equine conversations are welcomed. </p> <p>Of the video installations, Nikolaj Larsen's Love is a fuzzy-pictured shot of a couple kissing in the rain, with a maniac occasionally shouting \"I love you\" in the background. It is at once intimate and horrible. Also intriguing is Vali and Ameneh by Johannes Maier, a chat between two bilingual Iranian speakers, and you have to listen carefully to hear them slip between the colloquialisms of the two languages. If the video work seems to wisely eschew political content, then this is counteracted by Phil Collins's How to Make a Refugee, a two-screen documentary showing a lifestyle magazine photographing refugees. In a rather obvious indictment of the media, Collins clearly reveals the humiliation of the young boy being photographed. </p> <p>Of course, there is much playfulness on show too. Edward Weldon's small but chunky oil paintings of envelopes, cash tills, and skips are grubby delights, while Cable Car by an artist known simply as Eric is a life-size model in wood. Jennifer Beattie's sculpture, Beautiful Tree, is made of varnished branches which look like barbecued ribs and boast Sellotape clusters for blossom. It might sound like a Blue Peter special, but it's rather stunning. Also striking are Marta Marce's post-Hirst canvases of bold lines and spirals.</p>",
  "<p>Was I the only person in Britain to watch the England match live in the comfort of my own home on Wednesday? I ask only because three separate radio stations, including the British Forces Broadcasting Service, rang me on Thursday morning to interview me about the experience. Fortunately I was able to reassure our plucky lads overseas (the forces, that is, not the England team) that, to paraphrase WC Fields, on the whole I would rather have been in Akrotiri. </p> <p>I can understand why the world's media beat a path to my door. Given England's performance against Germany and the team chosen by Howard Wilkinson, the only people likely to go to the trouble of signing up for an away match in Helsinki were going to be television critics or inveterate masochists - and a lot of them tend to be ex-directory. </p> <p>And for something that was not exactly the hottest ticket in town, you really did have to go to an awful lot of trouble to buy it. u&gt;direct, as well as forcing us to search for the &gt; symbol on our typewriters, require us to register with them before we can order a match. </p> <p>To do this you have to remove your Sky viewing card, and key in on your telephone keypad a series of numbers, roughly the length of Bill Gates's monthly tax deduction . They don't tell you that you are going to have to do all this until you start the whole registration process, which means you have to put the telephone down while you look for your reading glasses, which you finally track down to the bathroom. </p> <p>You also have to give them your credit card details, which I was rather uneasy about doing. The way I saw it this was more than making just one purchase on the telephone. These u&gt;direct people now have my Visa number for all eternity, and could in theory charge me for all sorts of broadcasts. Whom do I complain to when Debbie Does Dallas shows up on my bank statement? </p> <p>I pose the question because at no time in my convoluted telephone dealings with u&gt;direct was I allowed the privilege of human communication. A mechanical voice quizzes you on vital personal details, such as address, post code, favourite member of the group Steps and so on, moving you on after each answer and giving you no chance to ask questions of your own like, \"Is there a refund if he doesn't bring Owen on?\", or \"Can I get a receipt so I can claim the money back from The Guardian?\" </p> <p>This was of special interest to me, as I find it particularly hard in these tough times to justify \u00a310 of the family budget going on an England match. I was toying with the idea of asking u&gt;direct if they could disguise the purchase as late night pornography so as not to embarrass me, but there is no evidence that they actually employ a human being that I might ask. </p> <p>Even their presenter Angus Scott, on the surface a human presence, raised doubts. He was perfectly relaxed and confident but bore a worrying resemblance to Steve Scott, who fronts Channel Five's football. Perhaps they are brothers but another explanation could be that a factory somewhere is turning out these Scotts for minority television channels who do not want to shell out for a Gary or Des. </p> <p>What aroused my suspicions that Scott might be the result of an Invasion Of The Body Snatchers style scenario was his delivery of the words \"And that result lifts us above Albania in the table\" (true at the time), which he managed without any signs of the normal human impulse to emit a hollow laugh or at least to raise an ironic eyebrow. Actually, if he had really wanted to empathise with his poor customers at home, he would have broken down and wept, and started banging his head on the table. </p> <p>It is so much more fun supporting Scotland. This week you could not only watch them for free achieve a creditable draw against Croatia but also enjoy a cracking documentary in which Alan Hansen relived the agony and ecstasy of their recent international history. </p> <p>The programme was not much more than Hansen chatting to his old mates - Graeme Souness, Ally McCoist, Gary Lineker - about the habit of Scottish teams over the years of confounding all expectations but it was hugely enjoyable nostalgia. </p> <p>Obviously, to get the flavour of all the unexpected triumphs and crashing disappointments, Hansen had to visit Argentina and Spain, where Scotland competed in the World Cups of 1978 and 1982. </p> <p>I am not altogether sure, though, he needed to go to rural Virginia to see Robert Duvall, who is starring in a film about Scottish football. It reminded me of the Monty Python sketch, where Eric Idle strides towards the camera and says, \"I\"ve come to the Bahamas to show how expensive it can be to make these documentaries.\" </p> <p>Still, Hansen picked up some interesting tales on his travels, including the cocktail waiter in Cordoba, who ran out of beer and vodka during Scotland's 1978 World Cup campaign. Apparently, some of the fans drank rather a lot as well. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin@kelner.demon.co.uk\">martin@kelner.demon.co.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Until Christmas the Premiership table should carry an extra column. A simple Y or N, for yes or no, would indicate whether or not teams have played Manchester United. </p> <p>Not only would this add a sense of reality to the league positions, it would also prevent the sort of match Filbert Street witnessed on Saturday being hyped up as a \"top-of-the-table clash\", a \"showdown\" or a \"summit shoot-out\". </p> <p>No fair person would have begrudged Leicester City their fortnight's leadership of the Premiership, nor their pleasure of anticipation in taking on the champions as top dogs. But, as a United side lacking six of its regular players dismantled Leicester's presumptuousness with the routine efficiency of a surgeon removing an appendix, it became clear that Peter Taylor's side, far from belonging to the upper table, were definitely below the salt. </p> <p>Nothing should be taken away from Leicester's excellent start to the season. Having lost Martin O'Neill's passionate style of management to Celtic the team were expected to take a while to settle under the pragmatic, less emotional Peter Taylor. Instead Leicester have thrived on the coaching and organisational skills which Taylor brought first to the England Under-21s and later to Gillingham. </p> <p>Before Saturday their defence had conceded two goals in eight Premiership matches and in the league they have yet to let one in away from home. In Neil Lennon, Robbie Savage and Muzzy Izzet, moreover, they have a better midfield than most. </p> <p>None of which cut much ice with Manchester United, who controlled Saturday's match from start to finish without seriously breaking sweat. With Roy Keane directing operations in the massively authoritative manner of a regimental sergeant-major in the Irish Guards, Teddy Sheringham drifting into space at will, link ing the play and scoring twice, and youngsters like Wes Brown and Quinton Fortune gaining in stature all the time, the game struggled to become a serious contest. </p> <p>It was a timely victory for United, who since beating Everton 3-1 at Goodison four weeks earlier had been held to 3-3 at home by Chelsea before losing in quick succession to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League and 1-0 at Arsenal. \"We needed a good performance,\" said Ferguson, now contemplating Wednesday's return match against PSV followed by Leeds United's visit to Old Trafford on Saturday. </p> <p>Especially pleasing for the United manager was the way his spare parts responded after a similar selection had suffered such a demoralising defeat in Eindhoven. \"I was criticised for the team I picked against PSV,\" Ferguson said, \"but I felt I had to do it. </p> <p>\"You have to keep an eye on the big picture. It's a long season and there are always big games coming up. You've got to trust your players. We had 10 internationals out there today and they don't get those caps for nothing.\" </p> <p>It seems reasonably safe to assume that most of those who missed Saturday's match will return on Wednesday night. Ryan Giggs, who played for the last 18 minutes against Leicester, and Paul Scholes will be there and so will Andy Cole provided an ankle injury has healed. </p> <p>Ferguson also expects David Beckham, who missed Eng land's World Cup match in Finland with a knee injury, to be fit. \"He could have played today,\" the United manager admitted. But Jaap Stam, who has had exploratory surgery on a ruptured achilles, looks unlikely to be available until February. </p> <p>The lack of Stam's presence at centre-back is bound to be a handicap as United strive to reach the second group phase of the Champions League while maintaining their challenge in the Premiership. Yet the maturing qualities of the 20-year-old Brown could go a long way towards making up for the Dutchman's absence. </p> <p>\"Wes Brown has got the class to become a top player,\" Ferguson enthused on Saturday. \"He may have the odd rash moment but you get that in young players.\" </p> <p>Brown and Ronny Johnsen dealt easily with most of Leicester's attacks, the best chance falling to Gary Rowett in the first half when a free-kick from Lennon found the defence concentrating on Matt Elliott and leaving Rowett free. But from a narrowish angle he lifted his shot over the bar. </p> <p>The rest was largely down to Sheringham, who nodded United ahead from Denis Irwin's cross eight minutes before half-time and increased their lead 10 minutes after the interval when he followed up after Tim Flowers had parried Irwin's long shot. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer accepted a return ball from Dwight Yorke to complete the scoring in stoppage time. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "British human rights campaigner James Mawdsley is to be released from jail in Burma and deported back to the UK, the Foreign Office minister John Battle said tonight. <p>The 27-year-old was imprisoned a year ago for carrying pro-democracy leaflets and has been in solitary confinement at the notorious Keng Tung prison ever since. </p> <p>Mr Battle said Burmese ambassador Dr Kyaw Win had informed him today that James would be deported. </p> <p>\"I am relieved that the Burmese regime has recognised that there is no justification in keeping James in prison and has decided to deport him as soon as possible,\" said the minister.</p>",
  "In an office on the edge of Balata refugee camp, Hussam Khader keeps a nickel-plated Kalashnikov on his desk, an amulet for the men trooping in with assault rifles and bullet-proof vests. \"These people are going to fight with the Jews, but it is my job to use that in the negotiating table,\" the Palestinian official said. <p>That combustible mix of guns and talk, born in the back streets of refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza, comes into the full glare of international diplomacy today when Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, sit down with world leaders in Egypt to try to end 18 days of violence. </p> <p>Yesterday, Mr Barak said he would insist at the summit that the armed militias of Mr Arafat's Fatah faction, called the tanzim, which means organisation in Arabic, be disbanded, and that freed Hamas and Islamic militants be returned to Palestinian jails. </p> <p>Can Mr Arafat comply? Amid the wreckage of the peace process, many Palestinians believe that force is their only means of equalising the gross imbalance in international support and firepower between them and Israel. </p> <p>That argument is expressed most forcefully in Nablus, a stronghold of Hamas, as well as the tanzim. </p> <p><b> Hardliners</b><br> </p> <p> Officially, the tanzim operate with Mr Arafat's sanction, but there are no guarantees he can rein them in. Key figures in the tanzim preach a far harder line than the Palestinian leader, and want to seal off his options of returning to negotiations. They are seeking alliances with Hamas, and other Islamist groups which have opposed the peace process from the outset, and are now calling for violent action. </p> <p>In addition, the refugee camps are full of armed men whose allegiance is unclear. \"Most of the Palestinian people have a gun like you have a degree certificate from the university hanging on the wall,\" said Mr Khader. </p> <p>In Balata, where posters of the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein now hang as a symbol of Arab defiance, the tanzim leaders say they have just begun to fight. They predict a long and bloody guerrilla war against Israeli soldiers, and armed extremists in the 145 Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. </p> <p>The tanzim raised their first militia of 500 armed men in Nablus a week ago, and it has already been blooded in clashes with local Jewish extremists. Additional chapters are being raised in Gaza and in the West Bank cities of Jenin, Hebron and Ramallah. </p> <p>On the other edge of Nablus, which sits in a bowl formed by the surrounding hills, other forces are stirring. A day after his release from prison, Jamal Mansour, the Nablus leader of Hamas, is passing around a giant bowl of sweets to well-wishers. </p> <p>Detained for more than three years without charge at Israel's behest, Mr Mansour is edgy. Mr Arafat can order him back inside in an instant. Thirty-four Hamas prisoners were re-arrested in Nablus at the weekend. But for now, the Hamas leader believes he enjoys Mr Arafat's favour: among the callers on Saturday were several leaders from Mr Arafat's Fatah faction. </p> <p>\"Sometimes, in his mind, he needs signals to show he is still interested in the Palestinian national issue,\" he said. </p> <p>Such signals are Israel's greatest fear. When the Palestinian leader opened his jails on Thursday, hours after combat helicopters rocketed the perimeters of his Gaza headquarters while he was inside, Israeli officials accused Mr Arafat of giving a \"green light\" to Hamas suicide bombers. </p> <p>They also claimed he had released Mohammed Deif, the most dreaded Hamas bomber. </p> <p>That is untrue. Several dangerous militants, including him, were not freed, but transferred to house arrest for fear, the Palestinians said, they would be killed in additional Israeli attacks on their security installations. </p> <p>However, Israel remains in a state of high alert. </p> <p>\"It is clear that we have found ourselves in a situation where there is a great will to carry out a terrorist attack,\" Amos Malcha, the head of military intelligence said. \"It is possible that such an attack could interfere with a summit.\" </p> <p>For the Hamas, Mr Mansour is not revealing his hand. </p> <p>But he said: \"If there is still an occupation, what can we do? We will resist.\" That is his code for saying that the bombers have been activated. </p> <p>Although Israel says the resort to guns is inexcusable, it has an irresistible logic for the Palestinians. Under the terms of the peace process, the 30,000 armed police and security forces under Mr Arafat's control in the West Bank and Gaza are barred from turning their guns on Israel. He is also committed to easing Israel's constant sense of insecurity by keeping Hamas in check. </p> <p>The tanzim give him force, coupled with deniability. \"Officially, as soldiers in the Palestinian Authority, we can not use our guns against the Israelis because they will use this to attack us more and more. But if you have a militia made up of civilians, then the people will sleep well,\" said the Nablus tanzim leader, who would give only his first name, Nasser. </p> <p>Unlike regular forces, the tanzim are free to operate in areas of the West Bank under the control of the Israeli security forces. They also have an explosive charge, on a much greater scale than the last few days of skirmishes between the tanzim and settlers' groups would suggest. </p> <p>\"This is a game of chicken. It is saying: 'If you don't pull me back, I will go to the brink',\" said Khalil Shikaki, director of the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research. \"Hamas is Mr Arafat's playing card. But this is a very risky game because if Hamas has a massive suicide bombing, it could spell the end of the peace process.\"</p>",
  "The second big presidential debate was like nothing so much as the Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava in 1854. Instructed to seize the guns, the 600 rode suicidally in the wrong direction, and Al Gore did the same when he faced George Bush in Boston. The guns he seized were his own. He sacrificed his superior knowledge and experience on all aspects of policy. He fell over himself to assure the watching millions that he agreed with Bush on this and that. And when Bush laid himself open to charges of ignorance and hypocrisy, Gore spared him. <p>It was the most depressing spectacle and a disservice to the several million fence-sitters who will decide who will be the next president. </p> <p>How did it come about? Everybody and the polls agreed the day after the first debate that Gore won easily. Then three things conspired to change the result, manifest in a sharp rise in the polls for Bush. First, instant replay. When it came to anything other than a vacuous generalisation in that first debate, Bush was open mouthed like a fish gasping for air. The trouble was Gore showed his contempt by rolling his eyes and shaking his head. In the week following, television replayed this image without illustrating the provocation. \"Where were the man's manners?\" became a staple of conversation, instead of focusing the question on Bush: \"Where was the man's mind?\" </p> <p>Next, the Dick Cheney-Joe Lieberman encounter. The press and the Democrats had written off Cheney, but he scored big time. His directness and dry wit were much more convincing than the treacly lovefest Lieberman initiated with his friend \"Dick\". It was hailed as a gentleman's discourse but it had no virtue except that, for the Republicans, it blurred the differences. </p> <p> And then, the Republican war room swung into action and scored a major success with a lazy press. Once again, caught in story mode syndrome, they pounded a drumbeat all week on the narrative line that Gore is a liar. </p> <p>Gore's staff panicked. They made him watch a parody of his debating style from television's Saturday Night Live. They abjured him to avoid anecdotes where he might misstep. Gore would indeed have been well advised to make a small correction in his style towards deference, but he over-compensated. Unlike Bill Clinton, he is tone deaf to nuance. He did not merely control his facial reactions; he put his brain on ice. He grovelled. He was utterly out of character for two-thirds of the debate and it represented a sell-out to his convictions. There were cheers across the land when he woke from his sycophantic narcolepsy, but it was too late. </p> <p>And now to the campaign on lying that so rattled the Democrats. The first thing to note is that the people calling Gore a liar are liars themselves. The Gore \"lies\" are not so much lies as irrelevant and inconsequential misremembering of circumstance. No, on one particular visit to a Texas forest fire he was not accompanied by the director, but by a deputy. But yes he did visit Texas disaster areas many times and that was the point. </p> <p>The main attack by the Republican spin machine has proven false itself. Gore quoted a newspaper report about a girl who had to stand up because she had no desk at school. The school principal, embarrassed by the revelation, denied it and the credulous national media accepted that denial as evidence of a Gore fib without any further inquiries. In fact, as the Sarasota Herald Tribune has made clear, a dramatic budget cut has high school students going without desks for weeks. Good politics for the Republicans maybe, but lousy journalism. </p> <p>The most sickening thing about the Republican fib factory is that while the moralisers have been regurgitating the propaganda, they have ignored really substantive lies by Bush. Forget amazing small errors like saying, with glee, that Texas would execute three men for a hate crime, when it's two men, and he is supposed to stand aloof pending appeals. There are examples of his mendacity - or his faculty for memory-loss and myth-making - that will affect people's lives. He said in the debate that he is in favour of hate-crime laws, but he has rejected them in Texas. He asserted that the percentage of people insured for health was going up in Texas but down nationally when both have risen. He described the Kyoto agreement on global warming as imposing controls only on the US, but it is multilateral. He says he is for clean air, but has given in to the polluters in his own state. He said he favours checks on guns bought at shows, but rejects the three-day waiting period that would enable them to be effective. He says he will pay for popular new programmes by using a quarter of the budget surplus, but his own budget shows he has allocated less than half that much. </p> <p>Will the real Al Gore stand up before America sells itself short to the spinners? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The Tawang valley in India's north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh is a remote place. A few tribal farmers live here. The occasional hunter can be seen slogging up its hillsides. Were it not for the fact the Buddhist mountain region occupies a pivotal place in India's relations with China, the valley would remain one of the country's most obscure and underdeveloped areas. <p>As it is, the roads leading deep into its interior are in excellent condition, even during the monsoon months. Their construction is a legacy of the war which China and India fought in the Tawang Valley in 1962. The war saw the Chinese invade the valley and press on as far as Tezpur in Assam, inflicting heavy casualties and humiliation on Indian troops. The Chinese eventually withdrew to what is now known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC).</p> <p>Nearly four decades later the area is still a flashpoint between the two nuclear powers. Confirmation of this came last Friday, when Arunachal Pradesh's chief minister, Mukut Mithi, alleged that Chinese troops had been making regular forays across the highly sensitive border. </p> <p>\"Maybe they have crossed the border without knowing where the LAC stands - but in any case this has to be stopped,\" he said.</p> <p>Over the weekend Mr Mithi escorted a party of journalists up to the Sino-Indian border to prove his point. He showed them what he said was a new Chinese-built mule trail in the Dibang valley district, and claimed that \"repeated incursions\" were taking place. \"Normally they come in the guise of graziers or hunters by encroaching on the LAC. Sometimes they claim that the land belongs to them,\" he said.</p> <p>Whether the incursions are genuine or imaginary, they speak volumes about the continuing mutual mistrust which exists between New Delhi and Beijing. India still lays claim to 40,000 sq kms (16,000 sq miles) of territory occupied by China in Kashmir, while China lays claim to a wide swathe of territory in Arunachal Pradesh, which shares a 650-mile border with China.</p> <p>Unlike the disputed border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir, where rival troops shell each other every day, the Sino-Indian frontier does not ring with gunfire. Postal workers from both countries even exchange letters for villagers who live next to the LAC. China and India recently set up a working party to clarify the issue. But the tension continues: in 1986 the Red army allegedly constructed a helipad at the frontier, only for it to be demolished by Indian troops.</p> <p>On the diplomatic front, relations between Indian and China remain outwardly cordial. India's president paid a successful visit to Beijing earlier this year. China's foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, came to India in July. </p> <p>But there exists plenty of suspicion too, most of it concerning the nuclear issue. India continues to accuse China of helping its archrival Pakistan to acquire advanced nuclear missile technology. US intelligence and military sources confirm that Pakistan's nuclear programme is more advanced than India's because of assistance from China and North Korea.</p> <p>In 1998 India and Pakistan carried out tit-for-tat nuclear tests. India's defence minister, George Fernandes, defended the action on the grounds that India faced a nuclear threat from China. Last month he announced that India's latest inter-continental missile, Agni III, would be ready for testing \"sooner than expected\". The missile has a range of 2,500kms - enough to hit targets in central China. In turn, the Chinese have complained of Indian navy patrols in the South China sea.</p> <p>Though India's relations with Pakistan dominate the attention of foreign policy analysts in the US and Europe, the country's relationship with China is in many ways more intriguing. </p> <p>And more complex. The two most challenging postings for Indian diplomats abroad are widely held to be Beijing and Islamabad. \"In the short term the problem is Pakistan,\" one diplomat said. \"But in the long term it is the Chinese we need to worry about.\"</p> <p><b>Email:</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:luke.harding@theguardian.com\"> luke.harding@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/kashmir/0,2759,184266,00.html\">India and Pakistan</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/pakistan/0,2759,180809,00.html\">Pakistan</a></p> <p> <b>Other articles:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=luke+harding&amp;Query=luke+harding&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=Vdkpublicationdate+desc&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Luke Harding</a></p> <p><b>Useful links:</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.timesofindia.com/\" target=\"_new\">Times of India</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.paktoday.com/\" target=\"_new\">Pakistan Today</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.indiamonitor.com/\" target=\"_new\">India Monitor</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/in.html\" target=\"_new\">CIA world factbook: India</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/pk.html\" target=\"_new\">CIA world factbook: Pakistan</a><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mnet.fr/aiindex/\" target=\"_new\">South Asia citizens' network</a></p>",
  "<p>The city of Cardiff is effortlessly dominated by the new rugby stadium, the one they decided to build instead of an opera house by Zaha Hadid. Built like a cross between a ship, a space station and a branch of Sainsbury's, it is a permanent reminder that in this city sport and populism count for more than culture. </p> <p>With hindsight, the Centre for Visual Art was never going to make it here. The only major contemporary art space in Wales opened to a great fanfare in the Hayes shopping centre last summer. It was a converted Victorian library, but unlike the original institution it charged admission, and had a touchy-feely introduction to contemporary art for children on the top floor. It wanted to be the Millennium Dome and Tate Modern simultaneously, but had no chance of being either because its funding bodies - the Arts Council of Wales and the city council provided the bulk of the \u00a39m cost - expected the centre to make up a serious financial shortfall from admissions in its first year. The financial crisis at the end of 12 months was not merely predictable. It is almost as if it were planned in advance. The CVA is to close in its present form on November 5. </p> <p>Cardiff's political establishment went about the business of establishing the Centre so half-heartedly that it's hard to believe they wanted a modern art gallery at all. Instead of nurturing an audience for new art, the CVA acted as a proof to cultural conservatives that Welsh people don't want this modern art rubbish, see. </p> <p>Instead, Cardiff has a world-class rugby stadium. It also has the \u00a32bn Cardiff Bay Development - eventually to include an new cultural hub, the much-delayed Wales Millennium Centre - where the despised docklands have been turned into a genteel setting for businesses and fish restaurants. The aesthetics of the new Cardiff Bay, as with other waterfront reclamations from Sunderland to Liverpool to New York's Pier 17, are cosily retrograde. This kind of reclamation can create a pleasant setting for eating an ice cream. It cannot make a city feel like a city. </p> <p>Cities are cultural entities. The texture of social and economic life in them is defined by their cultural energy or lack of it, and cities all over the world - Glasgow, Barcelona, Seattle - have demonstrated that by changing the way their cultural life is perceived you can change everything about them. The problem is that culture is not something that can be neatly delivered from above. It cannot - as the Welsh critic Raymond Williams argued, because it is complex and living. When city authorities - and in the case of Cardiff, national governments - try to regenerate a city by mixing up architectural, artistic and leisure projects, the results can be catastrophic. Sheffield ends up with a National Centre for Popular Music (aka the Unpopular Centre for National Music) whose shiny Nigel Coates design cannot conceal the poverty of its displays; Newcastle gets a vast, pointless life-science centre; Greenwich gets the Dome. </p> <p>What these follies have in common is a patronising conception of popular culture. The question, as city after city tries to turn itself into a hip, swinging cultural metropolis, is what kind of culture do you want and why? To a city like Cardiff, the answer appears to be popular, mainstream culture. So opera was out, and contemporary art is out. Rugby is in. But what Cardiff's Taffia has done is to impose a boring cultural stereotype on the city, and on Wales, and then to build monuments to this stereotype. As a strategy for urban cultural regeneration, this is a disaster. Cardiff feels small - it is, with a population of 320,000 - and parochial. It has the commercial and leisure venues you see all over Britain. But this does not add up to any sense of metropolitan energy. </p> <p>Architecture in Wales means, for many people, medieval castles perched on rocky crags over slate-built towns. The castles built by the English in the 14th century are architectural masterpieces - dense, raw structures that still speak of power. The problem for Wales is that there is no metropolitan tradition to compare with these rustic ruins. The urbanisation of south Wales only happened in the 19th century and a country that had always had a tiny population scattered across small towns and hamlets never really got used to the idea of the big city. Swansea, with its mid-20th-century cultural scene, was perhaps the closest to a Glasgow or Dublin - but Dylan Thomas spent his final days in faraway New York. </p> <p>The Welsh have built towns that seem makeshift and frightened compared to the looming mountains. The interior world of the home has been valued more than public space; the national imagination is rooted in the village. For all these reasons, Cardiff's culture has shied away from the metropolitan and expressed itself until recently in a flight to the suburbs. That's why \"cultural regeneration\" has become necessary, with the Cardiff Bay scheme - including the construction of a \u00a3200m barrage to control tidal levels and the opening up of waterfront spaces for development - and the Millennium Stadium attempting to lure money into the city centre. </p> <p>In too many cities in Britain the bright, shiny dream of \"cultural regeneration\" has been pursued without the courage to believe in culture at all. What is most wrong is the assumption that a cultural project in a city has to fit in with what is already there. Sheffield thought it was a pop city (The Human League! Jarvis!); Cardiff thinks it is Rugby Central. But where cities have exploded into cultural life it has been a surprise. Glasgow's 1980s literary scene and cur rent art scene had nothing in common with the way the city had always been imagined. </p> <p>Good art is serious and difficult. It does not confirm what you already know. This is why so many of the new cultural spaces and projects in cities across Britain just turn into samey exercises of less interest than the opening of a new multiplex. At least multiplexes, music and book megastores give people access to contemporary culture. The lessons of success and failure in the cultural renewal of Britain's cities can be stated simply. Tate Modern or Millennium Dome? </p> <p>Across the country, enterprises that respect their public succeed. Glasgow succeeds, public art commissions such as Alison Wilding's Ambit in Sunderland succeed, Norman Foster's glasshouse in the Welsh countryside succeeds. Intelligent avant-garde culture excites people. In a city it creates drama and possibility - the essence of the metropolitan. By contrast, local authorities who have assumed that everyone is an idiot have ended up with embarrassing follies. </p> <p>If Cardiff wants to be a cultural mecca why not create something really wild? A John Cale Gallery of the 1960s Fluxus avant-garde, a Frank Lloyd Wright museum designed by Frank Gehry, a Gorky's Zygotic Mynci centre for bilingual culture - with a cafe called Bwyd Time. But then what's the point if the city can't even keep a modern art centre open for more than 12 months. </p> <p>\u0095 The British Art Show 5 is at the Centre for Visual Art, Cardiff (029-2038 8922), till November 5.</p>",
  "Iraqi success in achieving a peaceful outcome to the Saudi Arabian Airlines hijack yesterday capped what has been a golden month for the Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein. <p>Two Saudi hijackers diverted the Jeddah-London flight to Iraq but surrendered after talks with Iraqi officials. </p> <p>As the 90 passengers and 17 crew members left Baghdad for an overnight stay in Saudi Arabia before resuming their flight to London, the Iraqi regime viewed the hijack as one of the many blessings it has received in the last four weeks. </p> <p>Only in their wildest dreams would President Saddam and his cronies have envisaged that events could have turned so swiftly to their advantage. Two major changes stand out: in the last month there has been a flurry of flights to Baghdad in defiance of US and British sanctions and, in the biggest shift of all, the Palestinian-Israeli confrontation has helped in part to improve President Saddam's standing in the Arab world. </p> <p>By contrast, the last month has been a sensational failure for a US and British policy that stubbornly combines sanctions with the bombing of Iraq. In an extraordinary turnaround, Washington and London are losing out in the propaganda stakes to a dictator with one of the worst human rights records in the world. </p> <p>Iraq's success in ending the hijack provided its president with a propaganda coup that he exploited to the full. </p> <p>\"We are taking all measures that would reflect the real image of Iraq and its greatness, and [avoid] any action - God forbid - that may hurt any of the passengers,\" a senior Iraqi interior ministry official said before the hijackers surrendered. </p> <p>Early editions of the Sunday papers in Britain expressed fears that President Saddam might keep the freed British, Saudi and US passengers as hostages of his own. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, echoed this fear when he said: \"I hope now that the hostages will all be allowed to leave Iraq.\" </p> <p>President Saddam had held western workers hostage as a protective shield after the invasion of Kuwait. The temptation this time was that he might use the 40 Britons, 15 Saudis and one American on the Saudi plane as a bargaining counter for the dropping of sanctions. </p> <p>The fear proved groundless. The passengers were transferred to the Rashid, the best hotel in Baghdad, where Iraq's communications and transport minister, Ahmed Murtada Ahmed Khalil, visited them and said: \"We will do our best to serve you and to enable you to make telephone calls to your families.\" </p> <p>President Saddam has played the propaganda game so skilfully that Mr Cook was left looking churlish yesterday when he could not bring himself to offer thanks to Iraq for the safe return of the passengers. The best the foreign secretary could manage was to tell reporters outside his official London residence: \"I would not thank any government for carrying out its clear international obligations.\" </p> <p><b> Praise</b><br> </p> <p> A Saudi prince, one of the freed hostages, was less grudging. Prince Bandar bin Mohammed bin Saad bin Abdul-Rahman, 19, who was on his way to London to study English, thanked Iraq for the way it handled the crisis. </p> <p>Relations between the Iraqis and the Saudis are poor, with Saudi Arabia repeatedly vilified by President Saddam for providing bases for US and British planes bombing Iraq. </p> <p>The Saudi Arabian deputy interior minister, Prince Ahmed, said yesterday that his country would demand the immediate extradition for trial of the two hijackers, whom he identified as Faisal al-Biloowi and Ayish al-Faridi. It is unlikely that Iraq will agree to the Saudi demand - the countries have no diplomatic relations, although a pre-Gulf War treaty provides for extradition. </p> <p>A Saudi academic admitted that the Iraqi action had been valuable in improving relations but said that by itself it did not go nearly far enough. \"The trust that the Saudi leadership would be looking for is to see Kuwaiti and Saudi prisoners held by Iraq released,\" said Abdul lah al-Fozan, associate professor of sociology at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia. Proof would also be wanted that Iraq was no longer building up an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p>More significant in the long run than the hijack is the way that the Israeli-Palestinian crisis has helped President Saddam. Over the last fortnight, Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza and in the refugee camps in Lebanon have been parading pictures of the Iraqi leader as the hero who fired Scud missiles at Israel in 1991. \"Beloved Saddam, destroy Tel Aviv,\" chanted thousands of Palestinians last week at the Ain al-Helweh refugee camp in Lebanon. </p> <p>In response, President Saddam's tanks have been manoeuvring west of Baghdad over the last few days, a symbolic threat rather than a real one, and he has promised 1m volunteers for a holy war against Israel. </p> <p>The Arab League, which represents 21 countries, has invited President Saddam to attend a meeting in Cairo next Saturday at which its members are expected to agree a statement supporting Palestinian independence. It is an extraordinary invitation, given that the Iraqi dictator is still regarded by most Arab governments as unpredictable and dangerous. </p> <p>An Israeli government spokesman in London yesterday expressed alarm at the invitation. \"The seas of the Arab world are very choppy and that is a very big worry.\" He admitted that events of the last month had left President Saddam stronger. </p> <p>His good spell began when the first international flight into Baghdad since the Gulf war arrived on August 17. In the past month there has been a steady flow of planes, in defiance of UN sanctions. </p> <p>Although the UN security council supported the sanctions, they are only being actively pursued by Britain and the US. Russia, China and, to a lesser extent, France, though security council members, are opposed to continuing with sanctions and bombing. </p> <p>France and Russia have sent in flights and two Russian airlines, Aeroflot and Vnukovo, are preparing to begin scheduled flights, possibly as early as the end of this month, making Moscow the gateway for British, American and other businessmen heading for Iraq. President Saddam rightly sees these divisions within the security council as a sign of weakness. </p> <p>In another significant erosion of Iraq's isolation, the Iranian foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, left Baghdad yesterday after meeting Saddam Hussein, saying they had reached agreement on several issues that have been sores between the two countries since their 1980-88 war. Among the deals is thought to be an agreement to stop providing bases for guerrillas operating against one another's regime. Underlining the way Iraq is rejoining the rest of the world, Mr Kharrazi left Baghdad aboard the first Iranian plane to have landed in Iraq since the Gulf war. </p> <p>Changing days for Iraq, which even six months ago was still regarded as a pariah state by almost all its Arab neighbours.</p>",
  "Two men who hijacked a Saudi Arabia Airlines jet carrying 90 passengers, including 40 Britons, disclosed yesterday that they wanted to protest against Saudi human rights abuses. <p>The two, who were under arrest in Iraq last night, described themselves as ordinary people rather than international terrorists. The incident was not related to the Palestinian-Israeli clashes. </p> <p>The two hijackers surrendered in the early hours of yesterday morning at Saddam international airport in Baghdad after hours of negotiations with Iraqi officials. They had threatened to blow up the plane with TNT explosives. </p> <p>The plane, which had 17 crew on board, was hijacked over the Mediterranean on Saturday night en route from Jeddah to London. The hijackers forced the pilot to change course, flying over Syria and on to Baghdad. </p> <p>The freed passengers, who include 15 Saudis, 15 Pakistanis and various other nationalities, spent Saturday night at a hotel in Baghdad. Last night they left the hotel to fly to Riyadh in Saudia Arabia where they were planning to spend another night. They are expected to continue to London today. </p> <p>The passengers had not realised that they had been hijacked until the plane landed in Baghdad. </p> <p>One passenger, Jacky Doyle, a mother of two who works for the British Museum, said: \"I was not aware of the hijacking until I realised that we were at another airport, not Heathrow.\" </p> <p>One of the hijackers told reporters yesterday at the airport in Baghdad: \"We are just ordinary people and we are calling for the rights of the Saudi people, such as decent education, decent health and other services.\" </p> <p>They called for the abolition of the Saudi monarchy, which presides over a government with one of the worst human rights records in the world. </p> <p>A recent report by the human rights group Amnesty International condemned the regime for a series of abuses, in particular public executions. One of those on board the hijacked plane was a Saudi prince. </p> <p>The hijackers, who gave a press conference at the end of the seven-hour ordeal, said that they had chosen to force the aircraft to fly to Iraq because \"the Iraqi people are under embargo and because we trust the Iraqis and they will not betray us\". </p> <p>Both looked relaxed and one of them covered his face with a handkerchief. They refused to give their names. </p> <p>But the United Arab Emirates satellite television channel in Abu Dhabi identified the two men as Ayeish Ali al-Khalidi and Faisel Naji al-Bluey, both from Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>The hijackers twice threatened to destroy the Boeing jet, once in the air and again on the tarmac of the airport in Baghdad. </p> <p>\"We carried out the operation because we believe in the principles of justice and equality,\" said one. The other added that the Saudi people were opposed to the presence of American troops in their country. </p> <p>Both hijackers said they had not asked for political asylum and did not intend to stay in Iraq. Although Saudi Arabia has asked for their return, the Iraqi government hinted that it was unlikely to comply, given that there are no diplomatic ties between the two countries. </p> <p>Passengers told how the hijackers had shown the captain a cache of three bombs and a gun. </p> <p>Waqas Hussein, 21, a passenger from Pakistan going to study in the UK, said there had been little or no security at Jeddah airport when they began their journey. \"There wasn't any checking of our luggage or ourselves,\" he said. </p> <p>He added: \"People were scared but nobody got rowdy. I saw some tense faces. After four hours sitting in the plane the captain announced that they had successfully negotiated with the hijackers. </p> <p>\"Everybody on board clapped as the hijackers left.\"</p>",
  "After a Tory junior home affairs spokesman denounced Cherie Booth as \"an unaccountable cross between First Lady and Lady Macbeth,\" Rabinder Singh must have been surprised to find himself caught in the crossfire. He was the colleague who co-wrote the controversial Daily Telegraph article last August on the human rights act which revealed, so the Tories claimed, that the prime minister's wife had her own political agenda. <p>Maybe it was linking the act to the \"third way\" which sent their blood pressure soaring. Booth was trumpeting legislation passed by her husband's government which would put millions into the coffers of her new human rights chambers, Matrix, said the charge sheet. It's not something Singh wants to talk about, and his reticence leaves the impression that it was a bruising episode. Although it was Booth who was asked to write the article, she brought him in on the task. A co-founder of Matrix, he has written extensively on human rights law, and the article reads more like his thoughts than hers. </p> <p>Today the Foreign Office will announce Singh's appointment as the independent monitor overseeing the fairness of the entry clearance system through which people from other countries are granted or refused permission for short visits to the UK. The inevitable cries of cronyism will go up and with some of Labour's appointments, such cavils have been justified. Not with this one. For one thing, the 36-year-old barrister will be taking a cut in earnings to shoulder the part-time job. It will occupy him for eight weeks a year just when the new human rights act will put him most in demand for high-profile and well-paid court cases. The \u00a3350 a day it pays is no more than half the rate he commands for his legal services, other barristers estimate. And there is no doubt that he got the post on merit. </p> <p>Chambers Guide to the Legal Profession rates Singh among the top three juniors (non-Queen's Counsel ) for public and administrative law. \"He is one of the brightest barristers of his generation,\" says the foreign office minister Keith Vaz, who chose him from a shortlist to go forward for approval by the home secretary, Jack Straw, and by the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, who makes the appointment. </p> <p>The post was created seven years ago when appeals against entry clearance refusals were abolished. Since then, appeals have been restored for those who wish to visit relatives in Britain. That leaves those coming for non-family reasons without a right to appeal. The independent monitor oversees the decision-making process in those cases but plays no role in individual cases. He makes random checks on some 800-1,000 visa refusals a year to see whether decisions are consistent and fair, and makes an annual report to parliament suggesting any improvements he thinks necessary. </p> <p>Singh is the second person to hold the job - his predecessor was Dame Elizabeth Anson, one of the Tory \"great and good\". At the bar, his is the first generation of Asian lawyers to make it into the top chambers. \"When I was a student, I had no role models,\" he says. </p> <p>Born in this country to Sikh immigrants from India, he grew up in a working-class part of Bristol and went to the city's grammar school. At Trinity College, Cambridge, he took a double first in law, then spent a year at the University of California at Berkeley on a Harkness fellowship. \"That's when I became interested in constitutional law and human rights. In a very serious way, my thinking on human rights was directly influenced by my experience in America. That's what induced me to come to the bar. I wanted to contribute to - dare one say it? - justice.\" </p> <p>He did his pupillage in the leading public law chambers at 4-5 Gray's Inn Square, where Cherie Booth also practised, staying there until, with Booth and a group of barristers from those and other chambers, he left to set up Matrix. Like most barristers in the public law field, he acts both for and against the government. But in view of his new role, he has decided not to do immigration cases for either side while he holds the post. </p> <p>Singh, now for younger lawyers the role model that he lacked himself, is highly visible in court, wearing a turban in place of a barrister's wig. No black or Asian lawyer has yet made it to the high court bench. But few doubt that, a dozen or so years from now, a turbaned judge will sit in the royal courts of justice.</p>",
  "Hopes of defusing the Middle East crisis suffered a new blow last night when Lebanon's Hizbullah movement claimed to have captured an Israeli intelligence officer - another card to add to three kidnapped soldiers it is already holding. <p>It seemed likely to cast a further shadow over today's Sharm el-Sheikh summit in Egypt, called by President Bill Clinton as a desperate attempt to halt the two-week spiral of violence between Israelis and Palestinians. </p> <p>Reports from Lebanon yesterday named the man as Hanan Tennenbaum, described as an agent of the Mossad secret service. But Israeli officials insisted he was a businessman who had gone missing in Switzerland several days ago. </p> <p>Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, secretary-general of Hizbullah, made the dramatic announcement at a meeting of Muslim leaders in Beirut. </p> <p>In Jerusalem last night, an Israeli minister, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, a former army chief of staff, hinted that tough action would be taken against both Hizbullah and Lebanon. </p> <p>But he also signalled that Israel might be prepared to negotiate with the radical Shi'ite Muslim organisation. </p> <p>Israeli Radio said that relatives of the businessman, who holds the army reserve rank of colonel, had reported him missing a few days ago after he had left for a trip abroad. </p> <p>Another report said Mr Tennenbaum had been kidnapped by business partners and transferred to Hizbullah. Swiss officials said they were investigating the allegation. </p> <p>\"We are checking information and searching in Switzerland but we cannot confirm that action took place on Swiss territory,\" said Rolf Debrunner, a spokesman for the justice and police ministry. </p> <p>The missing Israeli is understood to have been working for the Israeli electronics and telecommunications company Tadiran. </p> <p>There is evidence that Switzerland is a fertile ground for a covert war between Israel and Islamic extremists. In June, the Swiss supreme court handed down a one year suspended jail sentence on a Mossad agent caught by Swiss police during a surveillance operation on a suspected Hizbullah activist three years ago. Several Islamic militants live in exile in Switzerland. </p> <p>Ephraim Sneh, Israel's deputy minister of defence, confirmed that there was a man of that name, but described him as a private individual. Mr Sneh implied that Israel would be calling on the International Red Cross to take up the case, though it has so far failed to provide any information about the whereabouts of the missing soldiers, seized after a border gun battle earlier this month. </p> <p>The brother of one of the three said yesterday that the family had heard nothing at all from any source. </p> <p>Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, has interceded with the Lebanese authorities. On past precedent there is also likely to be a low-profile effort by Germany, exploiting its close relations with Iran, Hizbullah's most powerful patron. </p> <p>A decade ago, quiet UN diplomacy did much to help secure the release of the last of the western hostages held by Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon. </p> <p>Sheikh Nasrallah said further details would be announced \"at the appropriate time\". But his reference to a \"complicated security operation\" appeared to confirm suspicions of a kidnapping or sting operation. </p> <p>Hizbullah has already said it wants to swap the three soldiers for Arab prisoners held in Israel. Israel is still seeking to clarify the fate of an air force navigator, Ron Arad, who was shot down over Lebanon in 1986. </p> <p>In the past Lebanese prisoners held by Israel have been exchanged for the remains of Israeli troops killed in action, in complex and secretive deals brokered by the Red Cross. </p> <p>It is an article of faith that Israel will go to extraordinary lengths to bring its boys home. The Lebanese leader said that the latest kidnapping, like the seizure of the soldiers, was to show support for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza strip. According to the latest figures, 100 people, mostly Palestinians, have been killed in the clashes. </p> <p>Hizbullah officials meanwhile called on residents of South Lebanon not to approach the border fence for fear of an Israeli attack. </p> <p>Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, pulled Israeli forces out of Lebanon last May, fufilling an election pledge made on the grounds that a more effective defence could be mounted from inside the border. Israel had occupied parts of South Lebanon since 1978, when it launched a massive operation against the PLO.</p> <p><b>Prisoners they want to swap</b></p> <p><b> Hizbullah</b> wants Israel to release 15 Lebanese prisoners, including two senior leaders. The Palestinians have asked Hizbullah to include about 1,600 Palestinian prisoners in any swap </p> <p><b> Iran</b> wants four of its nationals believed to have been held by Israel since the 1982 Lebanon war to be included in an exchange </p> <p><b> Israel</b> wants back three of its soldiers, who were captured last week just over the Lebanese border, and presumably also the \"businessman\" whose capture was announced yesterday. It is also seeking information about an air-force navigator, Ron Arad, missing since 1986</p>",
  "A high mound of earth, piled outside a mud hut in Kasubi suburb in Gulu Town, marks the spot where Rose Akello was buried after falling victim to a mystery virus which caused her to bleed to death. <p>In the next fortnight, seven of her family and friends, many of whom had attended her funeral, also fell victim. Doctors believe that they may have contracted the virus when they washed their hands in a shared bowl of water at her burial, a local custom symbolising unity.</p> <p>On Saturday, health officials confirmed that the strange illness which has left 33 people dead in the northern Ugandan district of Gulu is the Ebola virus - a highly contagious form of viral haemorrhagic fever in which victims die bleeding from every orifice.</p> <p>This is the first recorded incidence of Ebola in the country, although in 1977 a related form of viral haemorrhagic fever, Marburg, killed 19 people in Bugiri, eastern Uganda.</p> <p>So far, 62 people are known to have contracted the virus, all within a 20-mile radius of Gulu Town. But more cases report daily to Gulu's two hospitals. Doctors believe that the true number of those affected could be far higher.</p> <p>\"Eighty per cent of those who arrive tell you that they have lost people in their families, five or six for every one that comes into the hospital,\" said Dr Matthew Lukwiya, a medical superintendent at Lacor Mission hospital, three miles from Gulu Town, where most of the victims live.</p> <p>The Ebola virus could not have struck in a more vulnerable area. Gulu district is at the heart of a 12-year insurgency, and more than a third of the population live in crowded refugee camps, often in fear of attack by the Lord's Resistance Army rebels based in neighbouring southern Sudan. The region is poor and marginalised, and health facilities are already overstretched.</p> <p>In Gulu Government Hospital, five victims of the disease lay on beds in a shabby room without glass in the windows, and with water collecting in pools outside on the veranda.</p> <p>A nurse tends the sick wearing plastic gloves and a face mask - her bare legs sticking out from beneath her dress.</p> <p>The better-equipped Lacor Mission hospital has also struggled to deal with the influx of patients. Three student nurses have so far died from the disease, largely because they were not provided with special protective clothing.</p> <p>The hospital, which is the best in the northern region, has had to cut back on all but emergency surgery. They have also had to turn away thousands of people who flock to the hospital every night to seek refuge from rebel attacks.</p> <p>The government has been slow to react to the outbreak, only dispatching its first fact-finding mission on October 8, a week after the first recorded hospital death. After confirming the identity of the disease over the weekend, the health minister, Dr Crispus Kiyonga, said that the government was implementing a national plan, focusing on public education.</p> <p>Health officials, travelling on bicycles and motorbikes, will scour the area in search of new cases. World Health Organisation experts have flown out to Gulu to provide back-up, while protective clothing, including gloves, masks and aprons, were delivered to hospitals on Saturday.</p> <p>It is still unclear how the virus reached Gulu. The last major outbreak of Ebola was when 245 people died in Kikwit, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 1995. The virus is carried by wild animals and is spread from person to person through close physical contact. There is no known cure.</p> <p>There has been intense speculation that Ebola could have been carried by a Ugandan soldier returning from operations in neighbouring DRC.</p> <p>Some 4,000 soldiers returned to Uganda in early August, and many were then sent to Aswa county in Gulu district.</p> <p>The Ugandan military has denied the allegations and said that none of its men, nor their families, have as yet fallen victim to the virus.</p>",
  "Hundreds of thousands of mainly black American men and women are expected to rally in the centre of Washington today for the Million Family March, set to be easily the largest public event anywhere in the US this year. <p>Like all the other rallies modelled on the 1995 Million Man March, the event will probably not attract as many as 1m participants, but it is a reminder of the enduring power of Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam group. He plans to bless at least 10,000 couples in a huge marriage ceremony during the proceedings.</p> <p>If that part of the event evokes images of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, in which mass weddings are a familiar feature, then that is no coincidence. Mr Farrakhan has recently forged an alliance with the Reverend Moon as part of a wider attempt to move the Nation of Islam into more mainstream religious life.</p> <p>Most of the participants in the march are likely to be black Americans, as they were at the Million Man March and the 1997 Million Woman March. But the event has been endorsed by religious leaders from almost all ethnic groups.</p> <p>Its main objective is to draw attention to high rates of divorce and single-parent families in the US, and to promote stable families. More than half of marriages in the US end in divorce within three years, and 70% of black American babies are born to single mothers.</p> <p>\"We would like to achieve a good turnout. We would like to give the people a seminal view of what the kingdom of God would look like when human beings, regardless of their race or their creed or their colour can come together on a higher principle of spirituality,\" Mr Farrakhan said yesterday.</p> <p>\"We want to put God back at the centre of marriage and the centre of home life and take up our responsibilities as fathers and that will be the thrust of the Million Family March.\"</p> <p>As recently as five years ago, Mr Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam were regarded with suspicion outside the black community, but that has changed in recent years.</p> <p>\"Mr Farrakhan has been reaching out to all races,\" said Andrew Compton of the Unification Church. \"We believe that all races should come together, and we want to teach our children that.\"</p> <p>The event has been endorsed by a variety of mainly white Christian churches, as well as by Buddhists.</p> <p>The ecumenical burst from Mr Farrakhan, 67, is said by some to follow a prostate cancer operation last year in which almost died.</p> <p>Dismissed in some quarters as a racist and anti-Semitic demagogue, Mr Farrakhan has begun to build some previously unlikely links, even in the Jewish community.</p> <p>The Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Joseph Lieberman, said recently that he had respect for Mr Farrakhan and that he \"would be open\" to talking to him, prompting criticism from more uncompromising Jewish-American groups, such as the Anti-Defamation League, for whom Mr Farrakhan remains a pariah.</p> <p>The expected large turnout in Washington may owe less to Mr Farrakhan's sometimes rambling teachings - he has hinted that he may be transported to heaven in a UFO - than to the involvement of leading US hip-hop musicians.</p> <p>Among the stars expected to appear are Jay-Z, Snoop Doggy Dogg, and Mary J Blige. The event's entertainment committee boasts the support of Sean \"Puffy\" Combs and Ice Cube. The support of such luminaries is all the more striking because many of the hip-hop singers have not been notable for their promotion of family values.</p> <p>\"It's cool to talk about family, or it's much cooler now,\" said Russell Simmons of Def Jam records. \"I'm hopeful that this event will make it even cooler.\"</p> <p>\"The rap community has always been one thing: real. They'll brag about their sponsorship deal with Coca-Cola. So they should have the guts enough to talk about family.\"</p>",
  "Nearly 500 years after he was held prisoner by the Spanish conquistadors in Mexico, the Aztec emperor Montezuma is finding himself hostage again. This time the issue is not one of sovereignty or gold, but is about his name. More specifically, whether having a college mascot called \"Monty Montezuma\" is demeaning to native and Mexican Americans. <p>The row is similar to others simmering over the years between native Americans and sports fans over whether the names of teams such as the Washington Redskins and the Atlanta Braves are inherently racist. </p> <p>One side argues that the names are derogatory and belittling, the other argues that they are harmless and part of the American tradition. </p> <p>Earlier this year, after pressure from Indian groups, the state of Maine removed the word squaw where it appeared in placenames. </p> <p>This latest row concerns the San Diego state university mascot, \"Monty Montezuma\", who appears in full Aztec costume to support the college's sports teams - known as the Aztecs since 1925. </p> <p>Pre-Monty, the teams had such names as the Professors and the Wampus Cats. Monty has been appearing at the college's football and basketball games since 1941. </p> <p>The student council, at the request of the Native American Student Alliance, has asked the university's president, Stephen Weber, to banish Monty and consider changing the Aztecs' name. </p> <p>In the motion requesting the change, the student council wrote that the continued use of Monty, however well-intentioned \"is inconsistent with the mission and the values of the university\". </p> <p>The motion pointed out that the fashion for such mascots based on Native American tribes or peoples started in the 20s, when colleges were seeking to forge new identities. Although the intention was to reflect the \"endurance and bravery\" of the tribes concerned, the continuation of the names was no longer appropriate. </p> <p>Old alumni and local politicians have rallied behind Monty. The county board of supervisors - in whose area the university stands - have voted in favour of the mascot staying. \"There is absolutely nothing demeaning, nothing racist about Monty,\" said supervisor Dianne Jacob. \"If anything, Monty helps instill pride, honour and culture.\" </p> <p>A \"Save Monty\" committee is backing the supervisors but a final decision will not be made until students vote next week. Although the vote is not binding, the university is likely to seriously consider it, such is the strength of feeling. </p> <p>Mr Weber, the student president, said: \"I believe everyone should have an opportunity to share his or her opinion before a final decision is made.\" </p> <p>Judy Baca, muralist and professor of art at the University of California Los Angeles, said: \"What is offensive is the notion of white people in costume doing a parody of a very noble people whose history is a blank for most Americans. It is not as if they are making a parody of a culture that doesn't exist, there are descendants of those people still alive.\" </p> <p>She said the issue was made worse because it was taking place in San Diego, next to the \"raw wound of the border\".</p>",
  "Arching steeply over the Danube, the Rainbow bridge is back in use again, at least for pedestrians. Opening it ceremonially to car traffic, 18 months after Nato destroyed its predecessor and the two other bridges in this elegant city, was meant to have been one of the high points of Slobodan Milosevic's election campaign last month. <p>But the work was not finished in time, and the first people to cross the bridge were not grateful citizens thanking their president, but angry protesters who brushed police aside a fortnight ago in one of the many nationwide demonstrations against the Yugoslav leader's election fraud. </p> <p>Instead of being a symbol of Yugoslavia's revival after Nato's air strikes, the bridge represents the tension between Belgrade and Vojvodina, the region of which Novi Sad is the capital. </p> <p>\"The bridge is actually illegal,\" says Radoje Cvetkov, the city's main architect and planner. \"Only three metres wide, each of the two lanes is much too narrow and the angle is too steep. If cars break down or get stuck on ice in the winter, there will be chaos. But, as with most things, Belgrade just went ahead without consulting us.\" </p> <p>European Union leaders confirmed on Saturday that they would provide the money to remove the debris from the other two bridges that still lie in the water in Novi Sad. </p> <p>\"Once the work starts, it will only take between two and three months to provide a wide enough channel for barges and ships to pass. The river has not frozen for the last 20 years, so winter is not a serious factor,\" Mr Cvetkov says. \"To clear the width of the whole river may take another three months\". </p> <p>The closure of the 1,750-mile waterway has had serious effects on Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, as well as Yugoslavia. Reopening it has been snarled in political arguments. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic insisted that the work be supervised by a Yugoslav (presumably one of his loyalist nominees), while the Danube commission, the long-standing body which represents all the riparian countries, wanted an independent figure who would put the work out to open tender. </p> <p>The EU was willing to give aid for clearing the debris but not - as Mr Milosevic was demanding - aid for rebuilding the bridges, because the latter could be seen as paying reparations for Nato's airstrikes. In either case, no money was to be paid while Mr Milosevic wasstill president. </p> <p>Now he has fallen and the money will flow. Mr Cvetkov is confident that help will also come for rebuilding the main suspension bridge, which sags spectacularly into the water. </p> <p>\"I think it's realistic to expect help,\" he says. \"After all, Nato always said it was bombing Milosevic, not the Serbian people.\" </p> <p>With money due to flow from Brussels, and probably Washington too, the main issue now for the post-Milosevic leaders in Novi Sad is how to get more money from Belgrade. The 18-party alliance in power there now, Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), which organised Vojislav Kostunica's election victory last month, swept the board in the regional assembly elections in Vojvodina last week, taking 117 of the 120 seats. </p> <p>\"Kostunica is not a solution for the Vojvodina. He was our standard-bearer in the fight against Milosevic, but he won't do anything for us. Our real struggle is only starting now,\" says the local DOS leader, Nenad Canak, who is chairman of the League of Social-Democrats of Vojvodina. </p> <p>A towering figure, who looks more rather than less formidable as he stumbles round his office on giant crutches after crashing his motorbike, Mr Canak is known as one of the most outspoken men in Serbian politics. </p> <p>\"The thing they call Yugoslavia is a fraud. Yugoslavia doesn't exist. The Yugoslav army is just an occupying force in Montenegro,\" he said. </p> <p>Leaving Montenegro aside, he favours a decentralised but federal Serbia with substantial autonomy for five regions plus Belgrade and a new contract for sharing the powers that would be left to the federal centre. </p> <p>While he favours Vojvodina becoming a republic within Serbia - some in Novi Sad want full independence - he knows that even getting real autonomy will take time. For all his fiery rhetoric, Mr Canak is a realist. </p> <p>\"People supported us as a weapon against Milosevic, not as a vote for autonomy or a republic. I won't force any autonomy changes through. First you need to build up public support,\" he said. </p> <p>Vojvodina used to be the jewel of the Yugoslav economy. It had all the oil refineries and the petrochemical industry, as well as flourishing wheat, corn, and sunflower fields. </p> <p>\"When Milosevic centralised everything under Belgrade's control, he took our resources and our money. Some 42% of Serbia's budget revenue came from here. Now we have to start getting it back and filling our institutions with real power,\" Mr Canak explained. </p> <p>\"The stereotype of Vojvodina is that we are slow and peaceful. It is wrong. This was always a military border area, so we are descendants of soldiers and are very tough. But we have learned that tolerance is the cheapest way of existence.\" </p> <p>In the streets of Novi Sad ordinary people seem to agree: \"Independence is unnecessary and expensive. We will be part of Europe now anyway. That's what matters,\" commented Tibor Wajda, 55, a Hungarian-speaking theatre director. </p> <p>\"For political reasons we can't get more autonomy. We need economic autonomy from Belgrade. That's all,\" said Dragan Vujanovic, who worked as a sound engineer for state TV for 10 years. \"Everyone wanted to get out of Milosevic's Yugoslavia, not secede from the Serbian people.\"</p>",
  "<p>Imagine having the opportunity to work within an organisation that has provided a dramatic home for many of the greatest actors of the past 150 years. And - as if walking in the footsteps of the likes of Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh and John Gielgud weren't enough - you get to eat your Pret sandwiches in a building that appears in the diaries of Queen Victoria, the journalism of Charles Dickens, the dramatic criticism of William Hazlitt and the music criticism of George Bernard Shaw. </p> <p>For an arts junkie, it looks like paradise. But is the day-to-day reality all free tickets to premieres, hobnobbing with the stars and as much free ice-cream as you can eat? Not quite, says Alice Holt, 28, who works behind the scenes as a development co-ordinator at the Old Vic, supporting the impresario chief executive Sally Greene. </p> <p>Holt's offices are situated within the Old Vic theatre itself, a stone's throw from the South Bank in London's Waterloo. Her enthusiasm is immediately apparent. \"No two working days are the same,\" she explains, from her converted dressing room of an office, complete with stage lights and a designer interior. Her offices do possess a touch of glamour, she confesses - the dressing rooms were designed by the likes of Stella McCartney and Vivienne Westwood. </p> <p>\"There is definitely a buzz of creativity emanating from here that makes for a frenetic but exciting working environment,\" she says. \"My schedule can be disrupted at any moment. My job consists of coordinating our fundraising activities, which involve many forms, and reporting back to Sally,\" Holt adds, citing a forthcoming literary lunch at the Ivy with Jackie Collins as an example. \"I also have to handle calls from corporate sponsors, and liaise with the company assisting us on guests and ticket sales.\" </p> <p>Holt's fascination with the arts stems from her degree studies in drama and English at Surrey University. \"I knew that I wanted to work in the arts in some capacity, but not on the stage itself,\" she explains. </p> <p>For her role, Holt insists that good communication skills, a cheerful disposition and the ability to think on your feet are essential. \"On the administration side, I type out mail-shots for distribution and reply to the regular letters that we receive. People often write to congratulate individual actors and the production team, which is great for morale. The myth of free tickets and goodies is not a reality, however, because we have to run the business at a profit; although I do keep abreast of our plays and see at least three in a season,\" she says, adding that it would be hard for someone to do her job if they didn't possess a passion for the arts. </p> <p>\"Even after a year, it's still a thrill to work among renowned actors. I've bumped into Helen Mirren and Simon Callow, and I've liaised with Stephen Daldry (director of the new film Billy Elliot) as he is on our board of trustees,\" says Holt. \"There is an element of glamour, but physically seeing actors is where it stops.\" </p> <p>What about the potential for nerves and stage fright to rub off onto the support staff? \"There's no doubt that after weeks of rehearsals, the imminence of the opening night spills over into panic,\" she admits, alluding to last-minute errors in ticket allocation, and banners not being up in time as some of her regular headaches. \"As a team, we feel an inevitable sense of triumph once the opening night has passed, and the after-show parties make it all worthwhile,\" she says with a smile. </p> <p>There have been big changes at the Old Vic in recent years. \"I do feel privileged to work alongside a woman with as much willpower and energy as Sally,\" says Holt, pointing to Greene's work with the Old Vic Trust, which saved the building from being turned into a lap-dancing club, among other suggestions, by buying it for \u00a33.5m. Holt's schedule has certainly upped in pace since the Oscar-winning star of American Beauty, Kevin Spacey, pledged to perform at the Old Vic in order to attract great writers, actors and directors back to the theatre. Greene has assembled a board of directors, including Dame Judi Dench, which will see Spacey acting as a consultant. \"I personally saw Spacey when he flew to London in July and needless to say I was extremely excited,\" says Holt. \"We have a lot of work ahead of us, but we like working hard and playing hard.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Three Colours: Red</strong> </p> <p>(Krzysztof Kieslowski, 1994) </p> <p>8pm, FilmFour </p> <p>The grand finale of Kieslowski's Colours trilogy, and of his brilliant career. The theme is fraternity, but chance and fate, love and longing, the whole sorry mess of humanity as well. Irene Jacob is a sensual, other-worldly presence as Valentine, a model who happens upon a stray dog and returns it to bitter old judge Jean-Louis Trintignant: we're firmly in homme-et-femme territory here, but as with Blue and White, destiny has a way of mocking human aspirations. It looks exquisite, is beautifully acted; a profound work. </p> <p><strong> Marlowe</strong> </p> <p>(Paul Bogart, 1969) </p> <p>9pm, TCM </p> <p>A minor appearance of Raymond Chandler's noble private eye. He's impersonated rather well by James Garner, who has the requisite weathered good looks and ramshackle charm - come to think of it, his TV gumshoe, Rockford, has a lot in common with the world-weary Marlowe. This is based on The Little Sister, which has him hired by a dame (Sharon Farrell) to find her brother; but it's never that simple. There's also a (literally) smashing early appearance by Bruce Lee. Decently done, with an authentic Chandler feel - as you might expect from a director called Bogart. </p> <p><strong> The Big Boss</strong> </p> <p>(Lo Wei, 1971) </p> <p>2.25am, FilmFour </p> <p>Here's Bruce Lee again, in his first feature, kung-fu kicking his way to fame. He's a gentle young fellow seeking work in a Bangkok ice factory, which he discovers is merely a front for big boss Han Ying Chieh's skulduggery (drug smuggling, prostitu tion, bumping off members of Lee's extended family). The trick is that Lee has promised Ma he won't fight, so spends half the movie in a pent-up fury. And then... </p> <p><strong> The Boston Strangler</strong> </p> <p>(Richard Fleischer, 1968) </p> <p>3am, Bravo </p> <p>A harrowing dramatisation of the serial killer's reign of terror in Boston in the early 60s. It looks like an American cousin to the director's other study of a real-life murderer in 10 Rillington Place. Tony Curtis transformed his pretty-boy looks and was never better. Henry Fonda leads the hunt.</p>",
  "A sweeping Taliban military offensive across the mountains of northern Afghanistan threatens to unleash a refugee crises and a wave of Islamic insurgency and drug smuggling through Central Asia. <p>Four years after seizing power in Kabul, the Taliban Islamic militia has made crucial gains in the past two months in the only area of Afghanistan still outside its control. Now that Taliban troops are sitting along western parts of the 1,000-mile border with Tajikistan, the Tajik government and its backers in Russia are increasingly apprehensive. </p> <p>Tajikistan has barely recovered from a five-year civil war that began only months after the collapse of the Soviet Union a decade ago. Unemployment runs at more than 50% and most factories have fallen into ruin. This year a severe drought threatens the lives of 3m people, half the population. </p> <p>So far Tajikistan has kept its Afghan border formally shut, fearing the impact of a flood of refugees. Aid agencies in the capital, Dushanbe, say up to 100,000 Afghans would descend on the country's southern provinces, the area worst affected by drought, if the Taliban made further advances. </p> <p>\"The large humanitarian catastrophe could be greater than that in Kosovo, one of the biggest in the world,\" Sergei Ivanov, the head of Russia's security council, was reported as saying last week. Moscow opposes the Taliban and is keen to increase its own influence in Central Asia. </p> <p>Radical Islamic groups in Tajikistan, it is feared, would be inspired if the Taliban seized the remaining 10% of Afghanistan. Islamic militants are believed already to be moving from Afghanistan through the narrow strip in the centre of Tajikistan and onward north into Kyrgyzstan and the Ferghana valley, where hardliners have long wanted a separate Muslim homeland. </p> <p>\"There is a very real threat of a spread of Islamism in Tajikistan,\" said an aid worker in Dushanbe. \"There are a lot of different divisions of radical Islamists.\" </p> <p>One of the region's leading rebel groups, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), which has bases in the mountains of Tajikistan and wants to overthrow the secular Uzbek government, was added to the US state department's list of terror organisations last month. </p> <p>Uzbekistan accuses one of the parties in the governing coalition of Tajikistan - the United Tajik Opposition - of supporting the rebels. In August IMU rebels fought their way to within 60 miles of the Uzbek capital, Tashkent. </p> <p>In the northern Tajik province of Leninabad, the Hizut Tahir movement, an Islamic group based on small, independent cells, has been pushing for a separate state. Leninabad is cut off from in winter when snow blocks the only pass. </p> <p>Although 25,000 Russian soldiers guard the Tajik border, drug smuggling from Afghanistan, estimated to produce 70% of the world's heroin, has increased five-fold this year. Rival factories in Afghanistan compete to refine the purest heroin, whose price rises exponentially on the smugglers' trail through Tajikistan to Russia. </p> <p>Some of the most vulnerable parts of the border are guarded not by the Russian army but by soldiers from the United Tajik Opposition, the Islamic group which, though now in Tajikistan's coalition, fought against the government in the civil war. For the Taliban, opium production is a big source of income; this year alone it brought in at least $9m (\u00a36m). </p> <p>The most immediate threat remains the current drought and the danger of a flood of refugees. At least 70,000 people fled the Afghan city of Taloqan when it fell to the Taliban last month. Up to 100,000 more would flee if the Taliban takes the last opposition town, Faizabad. </p> <p>In villages across southern Tajikistan people are on the brink of starvation. The UN's World Food Programme is launching a $62m emergency operation to feed 1m of the most at risk in the next nine months. </p> <p>The drought reduced most of this year's crops to dust. What little water remains is diverted to the state and collective farms which for decades have been forcing a lucrative cotton crop out of an otherwise arid land. </p> <p>Most villagers have used up their meagre savings and sold their livestock. Many were well off under Soviet rule, but now cars sit rusting in garages and even if the old fridges and black and white televisions are still working, there is rarely electricity. </p> <p>Malakhova Bibigul, who works at the Maxim Gorky collective farm near Kurgan-Tyube, lost her husband in the civil war. She has eight children but an annual income equalling just a few founds from her work in the farm's cotton fields. </p> <p>\"I don't know what my future will be,\" she said, clasping the white shawl covering her head. \"I hoped my eldest son would go to school and be able to support the family. But he doesn't go. We can't afford it, he has no money for books. I have lost hope.\" </p> <p>Mrs Bibigul is one of a group of villagers who have been given half a hectare of land by the World Food Programme, together with flour, seeds and fertiliser to survive the winter and grow a crop for next year. </p> <p>These Muslim villagers were once refugees themselves. More than 500,000 fled into Afghanistan during the Tajik civil war. Now they are likely to find families of refugees begging for help at their doors. </p> <p>\"It was difficult living in Afghanistan,\" said Qurbangula, 35, whose husband was also killed in the war. She is one of 60 widows on another collective farm close to the Afghan border who have been given land and seeds. </p> <p>\"But it is better to be hungry and thirsty in your own country than to have enough food but be forced to live abroad.\"</p>"
