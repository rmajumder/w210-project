  "<p>Rt Hon Tony Blair MP Prime Minister; Leader of the Labour Party (1). <br> </p> <p> Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP Chancellor of the Exchequer (3).<br> </p> <p> Alan Greenspan Chairman, American Federal Bank Reserve (7).</p> <p> The man revered as the architect of the unprecedented economic boom in the US is facing his biggest test. His every pout, strut, and subtle change in syntax or vocabulary is analysed and counter-analysed by global markets. His greatest test may come after next month's Presidential elections. The Fed, although politically independent, has held off from changing interest rates in the run-up to the polls. Greenspan, originally appointed by Ronald Reagan, was accused of losing George Bush Sr the 1992 election after interest rate hikes just before the poll. With the US trade deficit spiralling out of control and growth still stellar, Greenspan will be responsible for 'the soft landing' of the economy. Despite all the adulation he has received in the past, it is this job which will prove the ultimate test of his mythical abilities, and may prove the difference between global boom or global slump.<br> </p> <p> <br> Steve Case Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, AOL; chairman designate, AOL-Time Warner (59). </p> <p> If, in 10 years' time, the impact of the internet amounts to a fraction of the wild claims made for it now, then much of the credit will go to Steve Case. The proposed \u00a3128 billion merger of his company, America Online with Time Warner, itself trying to merge with UK music group, EMI, represents the first conjuncture of old and new media. He barely registered on last year's list but this year he was the star of the show at the Davos World Economic Forum, eclipsing even Bill Gates, and he was proclaimed king of the new establishment by the US glossies. The creation of AOL-Time Warner is the practical manifestation of digital convergence. Television, movies, music and computer games will be available on demand in homes over high-speed data links. Case was in a position to broker the deal because AOL was among that rarest of breeds: the profit-making internet company.<br> </p> <p> Alastair Campbell Press Secretary to the Prime Minister (5).<br> </p> <p> Sir Eddie George Governor, Bank of England (8). <br> </p> <p> 'Steady but ready' Eddie's influence over interest rates has strengthened over the past year. He has made the casting vote in the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee on at least two occasions, keeping mortgage costs constant since February. Sir Edward became Governor of the Bank of England in 1993. His term was renewed for a further five years in 1998, his powers then greatly enhanced by Labour's granting of operational independence to the Bank in 1997, but weakened by the removal of regulatory powers over the financial sector. Last month he helped coordinate an international effort to prop up the ailing euro. But he is a noted eurosceptic, and as the Chancellor has tempered his euro-enthusiasm, and the economy prospered, so the relationship between the two men has improved. They now get on well. </p> <p> Bill Clinton President of United States of America (4). <br> </p> <p> Clinton's foreign policy often lays the foundation for the UK's. Labour modelled its election campaign on the 1992 Clinton victory; Blair used Clinton to promote peace in Northern Ireland. The United States dominated Nato policy over Kosovo, refusing to deploy US ground troops. Refused to assist Blair to forge a republican compromise on the RUC issue, which Clinton thinks should be addressed as outlined in the Patten report. Recently his influence in the Mid-East has been questioned. Such is the ephemeral nature of political power that Clinton - whose term ends in January- is unlikely to figure in this list next year.<br> </p> <p> Bill Gates Chairman, Microsoft (2).<br> </p> <p> The past 12 months have not been a great year for the world's richest man. The software guru has suffered the ignominy of having his company branded a monopoly by the US government which is now examining ways of breaking the firm up. Nevertheless Gates, 44, is still worth more than $60bn and it is far from certain that Microsoft will do the splits. Slow to realise the importance of the internet, Gates is now refocusing Microsoft into a company which aims to write the code for the next generation of internet-compatible devices. Disliked by some for the way his company has dominated the industry, Gates, married with two children, does not outwardly give the impression of being a bully. Quiet and reserved Gates has pledged to give away 95 per cent of his wealth to civic and philanthropic causes when he dies.</p> <p> Rupert Murdoch Chairman and Chief Executive, News Corporation (6).<br> </p> <p> Four million daily Sun readers and the 700,000 Times readers. His Sunday Times and News of the World are formidable money-making machines. In BSkyB Murdoch has 40 per cent and effective control of Western Europe's most profitable broadcaster. Was diagnosed with low grade prostate cancer recently, so speculation mounts that he is grooming a successor. His son Lachlan was last week appointed deputy at News Corp and seems the sibling most likely. As the election nears there will again be speculation as to the influence Murdoch wields over his editors.<br> </p> <p> <br> Sir John Browne Chief executive, BP Amoco; Trustee of the British Museum (23).</p> <p> It has often been said of Sir John Browne that he wields more power and has more influence over our lives than the aver age minister. After September's fuel crisis demonstrated Government impotence in guaranteeing petrol supplies, and its inability to force oil companies to ensure them, the Prime Minister may himself ruefully reflect on the truth of this remark. Browne has built BP from an important, but second tier oil company, to a global 'supermajor' capable of competing with the likes of Exxon. Two significant deals - the purchase of US oil company Amoco for pounds 30bn in 1998 and its subsequent acquisition of Arco pounds 18bn - have propelled the company to a market value of nearly pounds 138 bn and to the second slot in the FTSE 100 index. </p> <p>Highest new entry<br> John Chambers President and CEO, Cisco Systems Inc. </p> <p> Chambers, 51, is the man who wired the world. His company, Cisco, makes the hardware and software which powers the internet. It does all the back-end, boring stuff which means that it is set to benefit massively from the demand for e-business solutions. 'Are you ready?' runs the company's ads heralding the internet revolution. Cisco certainly was and its share price soared 50,000 per cent in a decade. Chambers is the internet revolution's biggest cheerleader and is the biggest critic. Cisco became the most valuable firm in the US earlier this year when it temporarily overtook Microsoft. </p> <p> <br> Chris Gent Chief Executive, Vodafone (31).</p> <p> UK's market leader in mobile phones, Vodafone's coup de grace was the takeover of German telecom company Mannesmann, valuing it at more than \u00a382 billion. Has become the world's biggest mobile phone operator.</p> <p> Rt Hon Peter Mandelson MP Northern Ireland Secretary (25).</p> <p> Returned to Cabinet after only 10 months in wilderness. After initial success, the peace process now seems precariously balanced in the face of Unionist opposition and republican refusal to compromise.</p> <p> Jonathan Powell Downing Street Chief of Staff (9).</p> <p> Became Tony Blair's chief of staff in 1995. Acts as the PM's fixer, liaising with civil servants, and behind-the-scenes Northern Ireland envoy. Refuted allegations that he masterminded whispering campaigns against Mo Mowlam and Frank Dobson. </p> <p> Nobuyuki Idei President and CEO, Sony Corporation (154).</p> <p> Leader of the world's largest corporation since 1995. Sony pioneered the video recorder, Walkman and Mini-Disc. His are the slogans 'Digital Dream Kids' and 'ReGeneration'. </p> <p> Greg Dyke Director General, BBC (11).</p> <p> His appointment provoked William Hague to spend \u00a3100,000 on media analysts to monitor BBC output. Drastic shake-up is already under way, with rout of middle management. He has even banned croissants at morning meetings to save costs.</p> <p> Marjorie Scardino CEO, Pearson (48).</p> <p> First female executive of a FTSE 100 company. Former Chief Executive of the Economist, her influence as head of a company that owns the FT, Economist, Penguin Books, Baywatch and Madame Tussaud's secured her number eight slot in Fortune 's list of most powerful women. Shares have doubled in two years.</p> <p> Rt Hon David Blunkett MP Education and Employment Secretary (27).</p> <p> Has direct responsibility for two of the government's key policies: raising school standards and New Deal. Launched inquiry into the marking of national curriculum tests for 11 year olds, and has introduced 'citizenship' classes.</p> <p> Rt Hon John Prescott MP Deputy Prime Minister; Secretary for Environment, Transport and the Regions (13).</p> <p> Presides over an annual transport budget of pounds 3.7bn and housing budget of pounds 2.4bn. Joined Brown behind the 'forces of privilege' campaign. Offered somewhat too eagerly to take reins in running the country so Blair could take paternity leave.</p> <p> Gerry Robinson Chairman, Granada Group; Chairman, Arts Council (39).</p> <p> Granada own a third of the ITV network. At the Arts Council Robinson is in charge of pounds 384 million of government and lottery money. Sits on the Creative Industries taskforce. </p> <p> Rt Hon Jack Straw MP Home Secretary (28).</p> <p> Remains a figure of calm as storms rage over Labour but...criticised over watering down of Freedom of Information Bill; under pressure to introduce race reforms in the wake of the Lawrence report; criticised over Asylum Bill and voucher system for refugees. </p> <p> Rt Hon Robin Cook MP Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Secretary (44).</p> <p> Has been kept busy with Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone and Chechnya, and has frozen military exports to Zimbabwe. Has been pressing Blair to enter the European single currency at an earlier date.</p> <p> Paul Dacre Editor, Daily Mail (19).</p> <p> The Mail outstripped the Daily Mirror's circulation for the first time in 1998, selling 2,421,319, the second highest among UK dailies. Instigated anti-GM foods campaign. Jumped on the asylum-seekers bandwagon, portraying many of them as bogus and thieves.</p> <p> Sir Richard Sykes Chairman and Chief Executive, Glaxo Wellcome (22).</p> <p> Appointed by Blair to the Council for Science and Technology, he opened the Edward Jenner Institute for vaccine research, to which Glaxo contributed pounds 10m. In May 1999 was named Business Leader of the Year. Paid pounds 3.63m last year.</p> <p> <br> Sir Richard Branson Founder &amp; Chairman, Virgin (32).</p> <p> Recently sold extracts of his autobiography Losing My Virginity to the Sun while a rival paper extracted Tom Bower's less flattering and unauthorised biography. Still hoping to land licence for National Lottery. </p> <p> Sir Peter Bonfield Chief Executive, British Telecommunications; Non-executive director, AstraZeneca (26).</p> <p> BT Cellnet will have stolen a march on competitors if its launch of the UK's first high-speed internet access succeeds.</p> <p> Lord Derry Irvine of Lairg QC Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain (33).</p> <p> Introduced Tony Blair to Cherie Booth when they were pupils in his chambers. His changes to the trial-by-jury system provoked outrage, especially from the Law Society. Now looking at judicial appointments after objections to his own choices. </p> <p> Wim Duisenburg President, European Central Bank (35).</p> <p> Dutch ex-banker now dubbed Mr Euro. Low value of the currency has adverse effect on UK exports to Euroland. The ECB faces allegations of lack of transparency in terms of policy and interest-rate decisions.</p> <p> Gerhard Schroder Chancellor, Germany (12).</p> <p> Glossy election campaign won him power and tag of 'Herr Blair', he took over a delicate role in European politics and an economy with 10.6% unemployment - 5m people. Hit early on by the departure of finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, due to policy divisions. </p> <p> Ed Balls Chief Economic Adviser to Gordon Brown (45).</p> <p> One of a handful of people the Chancellor will listen to, Balls is a prime mover behind the Americanisation of Labour economic policy. Regarded as 'deputy chancellor', he sees every key Treasury paper and is an advocate of welfare-to-work and promoting individual opportunity.</p> <p> Philip Gould Strategic Adviser (60).</p> <p> One of the architects of New Labour, key adviser to Tony Blair; married to Gail Rebuck of Random House. Gould is one of the most important people in Blair's inner circle.</p> <p> <br> Mark Moody-Stuart Group Chairman, Royal Dutch Shell (77).</p> <p> His reforms have upturned Shell's fortunes. Despite efforts to repair relations with the Ogoni people of Nigeria over the past two years ending in violence, with Ken Saro-Wiwa's successor being charged with murder and arson, Moody-Stuart has been hailed as succeeding in shaking up the Anglo-Dutch group and making it perform.</p> <p> Terry Leahy Chief Executive, Tesco (15).</p> <p> With a p\u00a3500m investment programme that will see 22 new stores and 10,000 new jobs, Leahy looks set to ensure Tesco retains its number one slot with 15% of the grocery market. Member of Demos think tank and the government's competitiveness taskforce.</p> <p> David Yelland Editor, the Sun (54).<br> As editor of the best-selling daily tabloid his influence will grow as the election looms and as the debate over the Euro becomes sharper. </p> <p> <br> Sir Robert May President designate, Royal Society; former Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government; Head of Office of Science and Technology (34).</p> <p> Argues for increased government funding for research, and more openness with scientific advice given to government departments. Co-wrote (with Liam Donaldson) report on GM foods, recommending surveillance but also saying there's 'no current evidence' of harmfulness. </p> <p> <br> Louis Gerstner Chairman and CEO, IBM (93).</p> <p> Heading the US computer giant since 1993, he has taken its total assets to $86bn.</p> <p> <br> Michael Eisner Chairman, Walt Disney Corporation (47).</p> <p> In his 14-year tenure Disney's market value has risen from $2bn to $75bn. But he lost in legal battle against former deputy Jeffrey Katzenberg over loss of earnings.</p> <p> <br> Steve Jobs Interim CEO, Co-founder Apple Computer Inc (68).</p> <p> Back in the limelight, turning the fortunes of Apple around with the new iMac. Results show increased demand for PowerMac G4 and new PowerBooks. </p> <p> <br> Linus Torvalds Programmer; originated Linux operating system (153).</p> <p> Bill Gates's nemesis: a Finnish student who wrote an operating system to run his own computer seven years ago and then publicised its code on the internet so other programmers could copy, refine and develop it. Linux, the free operating system became the favourite of geeks and system operators and has reached critical mass as many of the largest software and hardware makers announced plans to offer customers Linux-based products. System took pounds 1.25bn worth of business from Microsoft's Windows last year.</p>",

  "<p>The names sound gothic - Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego, Land of Fire, the uttermost part of the earth. Disturbingly jagged mountaintops confirm this gothic image, lurching up towards us as the plane tries to settle down to sea level. We are relieved to see the new intercontinental airstrip. </p> <p>Ushuaia nestles along the shore of a glass-surfaced bay on the Beagle Channel, in the lee of the spiky Martial mountains, which rear up dramatically like a backdrop from Dungeons and Dragons. It was a skyline I knew well from the Uttermost Part of the Earth, an inspiring account of life and hardship with the Indians by Lucas Bridges, son of the missionary Thomas Bridges, who in 1870 effectively founded and built Ushuaia - \"the bay penetrating to the west\". The jagged ridge of the Five Brothers and the looming witch's hat of Mount Olivia were old friends. </p> <p>When Darwin passed through here in 1833, he saw the Yamanas, aboriginal shore dwellers living a stark life, half naked and keeping warm with the fires they carried everywhere in their canoes. He thought they were wretched and subhuman. But Thomas Bridges compiled a dictionary of the Yamana language, showing it to be subtle, philosophical and rich in complex imagery. He stopped at 30,000 words, but the Yamana have long since died out from influenza and civilisation. </p> <p>Ushuaia is the most southerly city in the world. The original mission became Argentina's biggest penal colony where many anarchists were sent down from the north. The prisoners made Ushuaia into a city, building whole streets of houses, bridges and even a 15-mile railway. The writer Bruce Chatwin famously couldn't get in when writing In Patagonia, but times have changed. It is now a museum with tasteful life-size figures of anarchist prisoners lurching out of the cells. </p> <p>The nearest thing to a cathedral here is a church with a synthesised Casiotone bell instead of real chimes. But you have to remind yourself that this is a frontier town and as such it still has echoes of the gold rush of a century ago. Nowadays it is at the tourist frontier to Cape Horn and Antarctica and the Gothic mountains and glaciers that lie beyond. </p> <p>Ushuaia runs along a rise on the waterfront. Steep, criss-cross streets move up the hill, like Stanley in the Falklands. Its main street, San Martin, is non-stop shops with no shortage of End of the World and penguin paraphernalia. Downtown Ushuaia is full of cheap whisky; it is a free port and the whole of South America is mad for whisky: bars are called whiskerias; clothes shops have bottles of White Horse wrapped in jeans; newspaper shops with Teacher's poking out among the magazines. </p> <p>Though meat is the heart of Argentine food with plenty of parrillas, meat barbeques, in Ushuaia, it was the rich pickings from the cold Fuegian waters that called. The centolla, the king crab, is a treat. Sweeter and more delicate than our crab, the best we had was in a Ushuaia restaurant called Kaupe (Roca 470, tel: 2901 422704). In a family home up the hill, Ernesto Vivian, an engineer, decided to cook rather than work for the gas company. He cooked so well, with his wife Tessie serving, that they turned their front room into a restaurant. Ernesto does beautiful centolla salad and sea bass en papillote (wrapped in a parchment or foil package). He wouldn't give me the cheap white wine I chose and insisted on serving his best Rutini. </p> <p>On the seafront, Volver (Maipu 37, tel: 42901 23977) serves great seafood surrounded by loads of end-of-the-world bric-a-brac. Down the road, Tia Elvira's (Maipu 349, tel: 2901 424725) is like your old auntie's front room. They have yet more delicious seafood - hake, bass, and others too Spanish to mention. It's all good. </p> <p>This wall-to-wall tourist town has a bewildering number of tour operators offering trips into the mountains or down the Beagle Channel. We took a small boat run by a company called Patagonia Adventure, and it got us right in close to the sea-lion colonies. </p> <p>Clouds of hot breath shot out as the thick-necked males roared like fire eaters at the tourists and the females basked and looked impressed. A colony of cormorants who shared the rocks added a sharp tang. Out in the open, we twitched at wandering albatrosses, skuas, petrels, Antarctic shearbills, delicate winged terns and flightless steamer ducks neurotically paddling full tilt through the water. </p> <p>For trekkers, the moun tains are awesome. They are the jagged end of the Andean dragon's tail, tectonic residues jutting 6,000ft into the sky before sinking into the angry southern seas. You can walk to the spectacular Albino Eye, a glacial lagoon high in the mountains, or the nearby Esmeralda Lake, an unearthly milky-green lake deep among the lurching peaks. </p> <p>The best walk close to town is straight up into the mountains to the Martial glacier, hanging like an apron from a high ridge overlooking the Hebridean blue of the Beagle Channel. On the edge of autumn, the \u00f1ire trees had just started to flame in unison with the scarlet flowers of the firebush. </p> <p>The finest glaciers are up in the Darwin Range. For a price, you can sail up the Beagle Channel sipping whisky with 8,000-year-old ice, watching the glaciers at their dramatic best falling into the sea. </p> <p>Fireland has spectacular fishing. My local GP in the west of Ireland flies over every year to cast a fly. The idea of an Irishman leaving Connemara (a place that most anglers would give their casting arm to visit) to fish at the other end of the earth seems absurd. But ever since enormous brown trout were introduced into the rivers by Thomas Bridges' grandson, this has some of the finest fishing in the world. </p> <p>This place is so good for fish that George Bush was here the same time as me, up in a $1,000-a-night 10-star lodge the other side of the mountains. CNN's Ted Turner has just bought an estancia up on the frontier. </p> <p>You can go horse trekking from Adolfo Imbert's equestrian centre. The best trips involve 10 days of riding, camping and eating meat across the uninhabited eastern end of the island, the rugged Mitre peninsula. It is huge, deserted and bordered by wild, wreck-strewn Atlantic beaches. </p> <p>We climbed a narrow trail up the side of Mount Susana, down to the seashore, through beech woods, scrambling down into a gully and across some rapids. </p> <p>As we came round the side of Mount Susana, I saw something I'd never seen before. Locked in mist along the coast of Navarino and Hoste on the southern side of the Channel, against Hoste's baroque skyline of peaks and ridges, was a straight horizontal rainbow stretched out like a spectral staircarpet along the water's edge. </p> <p>I found a big Croatian presence in Fireland, a whole community having been set up following the large waves of migrants that arrived around the turn of the century, such as the Marusic, Pomenic, Vrsalovic families, some coming out for the gold rush, others as carpenters or butchers. </p> <p>Over the other side, Porvenir is almost totally Croat. Some say that the wildness of Fireland's mountains was reminiscent of Dalmatia's peaks for all their dessicated whiteness. Many of the original Croatian houses still stand. The well-to-do Beban house, transplanted along the shore, is particularly fine and is a centre for arts and crafts. At night it lights up like an Addams Family theme mansion in Blackpool. </p> <p>A while back, I'd heard of a cowboy further south on Navarino Island, a man who rears horses and cattle, the grandson of a Croat who left Dalmatia to get as far away as possible from his homeland. Just north of Cape Horn on the windswept edge of the Antarctic sea is as far as itis possible to get. Just think, the most southerly cowboy in the world is a Croat. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p>British Airways (0345 222111) flies to Buenos Aires from \u00a3445 return.

  "<p>1 <a href=\"http://www.valdisere.net/index-gb.htm\">Val d'Is\u00e8re/Tignes, France</a><br> There are drawbacks to the place, admittedly. Among them are the uncomfortably large number of other British skiers, long queues for the main access lifts at the start of the day and for some connections at the end of the afternoon. But such is the enormous variety of skiing, to which few other areas can hold a candle, that these seem minor irritations. </p> <p>It has been argued that, depending on one's level of ability, the slopes are all too easy or too difficult, with not enough confidence builders in between for intermediate skiers. Certainly, once you take out the easy green runs, most pistes are a degree or two steeper than those of most resorts. The accomplished skier, however, will find it impossible to exhaust all the options in a week, or perhaps even a fortnight. </p> <p>Tignes is tarting itself up but its architecture is too bleakly functional for it ever to be considered pretty. Val sprawls a bit but has better looks and, with haunts such as the celebrated Dick's Tea Bar, is reckoned to offer the livelier night life. </p> <p>2 <a href=\"http://www.meribel.net/\">M\u00e9ribel, France</a><br> Any resort in the Trois Vall\u00e9es would do. Some would go for the sophistication of Courchevel, some for the altitude of Val Thorens - the highest in Europe. But M\u00e9ribel is arguably the most convenient base from which to roam this vast expanse of ski terrain in the French Savoie. </p> <p>Founded by an Englishman just before the second world war, it has a preponderance of chalets, is somewhat spread out - and also attracts a disproportionately large British clientele. But the skiing compensates. If the Trois Vall\u00e9es finished behind Val d'Is\u00e8re/ Tignes in a vote for the world's finest slopes I'm sure thousands of skiers would be screaming for a recount. </p> <p>The area has 200 lifts and some 375 miles of prepared pistes, but that ignores the many off-piste options. </p> <p>An intermediate can ski for mile upon mile of exercising but unfrightening terrain but there is no shortage of challenges for experts, not least the couloirs (corridors) from Saulire. Some linking runs are very busy and can be unpleasant, but it is always possible to escape the crowds and find some uncluttered snow. </p> <p>3 <a href=\"http://www.ski-arlberg.com//index_en.htm\">St Anton, Austria </a><br>The most impressive skiing in the country. Some runs marked easy blue would rate a trickier red anywhere else, some reds would be black, and its marked, unpisted itineraries and other off-piste options are rarely found in Europe outside the major areas in France. </p> <p>In spring conditions, with a guide who knows where and when the snow will be best, St Anton can set the pulse racing. Yet despite its tough reputation, it is a good option for families with young children because it is always easy on the Valluga side of the valley to ski hard and get back quickly to the nursery slopes. </p> <p>The resort is undergoing a makeover. Generations of skiers have plodded from their hotels to the slopes beneath the railway line which crosses the Arlberg pass but now the track has been diverted to the outskirts. A new gondola lift is being built which could see the demolition of the ageing Kandaharbahn mountain railway. </p> <p>4 <a href=\"http://www.zermatt.ch/index.e.html\">Zermatt, Switzerland</a><br>So infuriatingly inconvenient that it ought not to qualify - yet its unique character keeps it among the elite. Perhaps it is the image of families arriving at hotels for Christmas in horse-drawn sleighs for Christmas, swathed in fur and laden with gifts. Or maybe it is the plethora of great eateries on and off the slopes, or champagne at Elsie's Place, or hotels such as the Monte Rosa, where Winston Churchill stayed and which Edward Whymper used as a base when he set out to climb Zermatt's trademark, the Matterhorn. </p> <p>There are plenty of pluses to make up for the irritation of lift queues and clumping around icy streets in ski boots - and you can avoid that by staying at the new Riffelalp Hotel up on the slopes. </p> <p>The skiing, by the way, is excellent, particularly for intermediates and above, but Zermatt is definitely for those who want more than just a work out on the snow. </p> <p>5 <a href=\"http://www.skitaos.org/index.phtml \">Taos, New Mexico</a><br>Like no other. You can ski all day on perfect snow and drop down to a balmy Rio Grande valley for an outdoor swim among the cacti and sagebrush. </p> <p>The skiing is sensational. When you arrive the first thing you see is Al's Run, named after a doctor who skied it with an oxygen tank after suffering a heart attack. It is so daunting that the management was prompted to post a notice, reassuring the apprehensive that there is easier terrain, too. And so there is, but it is for the steep and bumpy that you remember this mountain. </p> <p>And at night there is always the town of Taos, still a magnet for writers and artists, where Georgia O'Keefe painted and DH Lawrence came hoping the dry air would alleviate his tuberculosis. </p> <p>6 <a href=\"http://www.aspen.com\"> Aspen, Colorado</a> <br>Great skiing, smart hotels, splendid restaurants and shopping - Aspen has it all. With neighbouring Aspen Highlands, Snowmass and Buttermilk all on the same lift ticket, the choice of terrain is enormous. Aspen's Ajax mountain has bump slopes to tax the most rubber-legged. For powderhounds, there is wonderful snowcat skiing in back-country glades. Snowmass has the Big Burn, acknowledged among the longest, widest, most ecstatically enjoyable intermediate runs anywhere. Highlands skiing is rich and varied, while Buttermilk is ideal for beginners and children. </p> <p>Clear your credit card account before you go - but although it has a ritzy image and some unashamedly expensive hotels, Aspen has plenty of more modestly-priced options. As for celebs, it is big enough to swallow them. </p> <p>7 <a href=\"http://www.jacksonhole.com/skiing/index.html\">Jackson Hole, Wyoming</a><br>It is unlikely you will leave without sighting moose. To arrive on a day of bright sunshine and spot one of those ungainly creatures drinking from the glittering, snow banked Snake River, droplets shaking from its disproportionately huge head, leaves an unfading imprint. Skiing back to a condominium, I once encountered a pair of them, grazing on shoots a few yards from the trail. </p> <p>Yet it is for elk that Jackson Hole is best known. The refuge here, established to feed them through the harsh winters, was one of the world's first major conservation projects. </p> <p>Its reputation as a resort for hard skiers is justified by some unnervingly tricky descents. Skiing the Hobacks on a day of leaden skies and fresh powder is hard to beat. And, as in Val d'Is\u00e8re and St Anton, its intermediate skiing provides a consistent challenge. That need not deter those with more modest talents, for there is plenty of easier terrain. Besides, its greatest draws are the remoteness of that broad, flat valley on the edge of Yellowstone National Park. </p> <p>8 <a href=\"http://www.lesarcs.com/\">Les Arcs, France</a><br> Varied is the best way to describe the piste lay out at this purpose-built French resort, which has something for skiers of all standards. Off piste, it can be wonderful, too. </p> <p>Always innovative, this was the resort which introduced ski \u00e9volutif - a method of teaching that involves starting on very short skis and gradually progressing to longer ones - and still offers customers the chance to test their courage on the \"Flying Kilometre\" speed-skiing course, where even first timers can top 85mph. </p> <p>Most visitors stay in apartments, and Les Arcs is not famous for its nightlife, but the sheer convenience of stepping straight from your accommodation on to such excellent slopes is an undeniable bonus. </p> <p>9 <a href=\"http://www.whistler-blackcomb.com/home.html\">Whistler/Blackcomb, British Columbia</a><br> Purists may argue that its nearness to the Pacific sometimes compromises conditions, but even if it is sugary at the bottom the snow is invariably good at the top. Proximity to Vancouver, less than two hours' drive away, certainly means queues and sometimes crowded runs at weekends. But the all-round experience keeps the merged resorts of Whistler and Blackcomb in the premier league. </p> <p>Though their neighbouring mountains are cheek by jowl, you have to return to the bottom to switch between them. However the ski area is vast and full of surprises, boasting long, swooping intermediate confidence builders and tough bowls and couloirs for experts. </p> <p>10 <a href=\"http://www.verbier.ch\">Verbier, Switzerland</a><br>There has never been any question mark against the quality and breadth of Verbier's skiing. Those who know it intimately swear by it. More than 250 miles of marked runs cover four valleys, linking the resort with Thyon, Nendaz and Veysonnaz. A huge network of expert descents provides constant challenge and variety. </p> <p>Verbier classifies almost all its black runs as \"ski itineraries\" which, while they may not be groomed, are skied by such an army of aficionados that they might as well be. They include the notorious and often heavily mogulled Tortin. On top of that, genuine off-piste possibilities are legion. Nor could anyone complain of a lack of restaurants or rocking night spots. </p> <p>Despite all this, however, Verbier was attacked in the 1980s for failure to update lifts which led to long queues. That has changed. Two new gondolas have been built and an electronic, hands-free lift pass introduced. Improvement has been dramatic.</p>",
  "<p>Marrakech's bewilderingly seductive <strong> Djemaa el Fna </strong> square has left a powerful impression on visiting writers. These range from Elias Canetti and Paul Bowles - who said, without it, Marrakech could be any Moroccan city - to Esther Freudin her novel turned film, Hideous Kinky. </p> <p>But perhaps the most telling word comes from one still living in the medina, Juan Goytisolo - known to the locals as \"the Spaniard\". Hymning the transient life of Djemaa el Fna in his novel Makbara (Serpent's Tail), he scoffs at the contradictory advice fed to tourists; namely to approach in daylight or after nightfall, by stealthy observation from its caf\u00e9 terraces or through a headlong plunge into its perpetual commotion. \"All the guidebooks lie,\" he writes. \"There is simply no way of getting a firm grip on it.\" </p> <p>Less a square than an irregular expanse, abutted by souks and spectacularly backed by the high Atlas mountains, Djemaa el Fna may have been named \"assembly of the dead\" as a place of execution, or \"mosque of nothing\" after an abandoned building plan. But it now draws Marrakchis and strangers alike in a perpetual round of trading, eating and entertainment. </p> <p>Partly for its protean elusiveness, Djemaa el Fna is a compelling spectacle, with a sensory overload of cooking smells and stove smoke, car horns and mesmeric drum beats. Musicians, snake-charmers, acrobats, healers and henna painters compete to beguile onlookers. </p> <p>The culture of the city, founded in the 11th century as a Berber hub, reflects its Arab-African origins, as Berbers mingled with Arabs, Saharan nomads and gnaoua - descendants of sub-Saharan slaves who produce the drumming trance music of the square. While Muslim women in the casbah may still wear the all-enveloping burka, younger ones are to be seen astride mopeds in sleeveless blouses and see-through gauze. </p> <p><strong> What to see</strong><br> </p> <p> Marrakech divides broadly into the still vibrant <strong> medina</strong>, rebuilt under the French protectorate of 1912-56, and the new town of <strong> Gueliz</strong>. The city walls - made of tabia, the red mud of the plains mixed with lime - can be traced in a cal\u00e8che, or pony trap, as part of a two-hour tour (roughly \u00a316). This takes in the palmery, the oasis on which the Berber city was founded,and where stunning sunsets can be enjoyed. </p> <p>The 12th-century <strong> Koutoubia mosque</strong>, just west of Djemaa el Fna, is a towering city landmark deemed the finest Islamic monument in north Africa. </p> <p>Little remains of the city's founding Almoravid dynasty apart from the ruins of a palace beside the Koutoubia. But to the north of the square, amid the labyrinth of souks, is the <strong> Ben Yusuf medersa</strong>, or koranic school, which was largely rebuilt during the 16th- to 17th-century, again with Andalucian influence. (Open 8.30am-noon, 2.30om-6.30pm; 60p). </p> <p>South of Djemaa el Fna, palaces nestle beside the <strong> Mellah</strong>, literally \"salt market\" and once the largest Jewish ghetto in Morocco. It thrived after the 15th-century expulsions from Catholic Spain, but most of the Jewish population left for Casablanca in the last century or emigrated. The quarter remains a place of trade, in everything from TVs to rosewater. </p> <p>The <strong> Saadian El Badi palace</strong>, meaning \"the incomparable\", is also in ruins, but worth seeing for its grandiose scale. (Open 8.30am-noon, 2.30pm-6.30pm; 60p, plus about 60p tip for the guide.) Nearby are the lavishly decorated <strong> Saadian tombs</strong> (same hours and entrance fee). Rediscovered in 1917 and restored under French rule, they have separate men's and women's rooms, and zellij (intricate tiles) on tombs in the open cemetery - they all face east to Mecca, but are occupied by Marrakchi Jews. </p> <p>It is worth a walk through the adjoining casbah, where men sometimes sit outside sewing djellabas (hooded outer garment), while mosharabi , window screens above the doors, allow women to check visitors without being seen. The ubiquitous hand motif on door knockers guards against the evil eye. </p> <p>Back across the Mellah is the late 19th-century <strong> Bahia palace</strong>, which houses the king's retinue on his visits to the city. (Open - unless the king is in town - 8.30am-11.45am and 2.30pm-5.45pm; 60p.) </p> <p>Shaded gardens across the city offer relief from the dry heat. The <strong> Menara</strong> in the south, less a garden than an olive grove for picnickers, has a tranquil reservoir around which Marrakchis gather with ice creams. Most captivating is the <strong> Jardin Majorelle</strong>, north of Gueliz, now owned by Yves Saint Laurent. (Open winter 8am-noon, 2pm-5pm; summer 8am-noon, 3pm-7pm;60p.) Bamboo, palms and giant cacti flourish alongside a lily pond with goldfish, and the cool green is offset by walls and tiles paintedroyal blue. The small <strong> Museum of Islamic Arts</strong> (60p) is also worth a glimpse. </p> <p><strong> The souks</strong><br> </p> <p> Anyone serious about buying a carpet or kilim would do well to get their bearings at <strong> La Maison du Tapis</strong> (7 Derb Baissi, Kasbah), a government co-op where fixed prices mean you can accept a mint tea without undue pressure to buy. </p> <p>Few leave without some ceramics - brightly coloured from Safi, or more subdued from Fes. There is also silverwear, leather, brass and copper, and instruments heard in the square, such as tambourines and drums. </p> <p><strong> Out of town</strong><br> </p> <p> The Atlantic fishing port of <strong> Essaouira</strong> is more than three hours away by bus, but under two by long-distance grand-taxi or in a tour minibus. Founded by the Romans and colonised by the Portuguese in the 17th century, it is a beautiful Moorish-Portuguese harbour town, with a wall of cannons pointing to the sea. There is also a thriving artists' quarter (galleries include the <strong> Gallerie Frederic Damgaard</strong>, Avenue Oqba Ibn Nafiaa) and thuya wood artisans galore. <strong> Afalkay Art</strong> (9 Place My Hassan) is one of several wooden craft shops with fixed prices. </p> <p>Try freshly caught grilled fish in the harbour, or take a table overlooking the sea at <strong> Le Chalet de La Plage</strong> (Boulevard Mohammed V, tel: 475972), for a banquet of oysters (12 for\u00a38) and sardines garnished with coriander (\u00a32.50) - which bear no resemblance to the sad minnows in tins. </p> <p>The <strong> Ourika valley</strong>, a summer haven for better-off Marrakchis, though prone to lethal flash floods, is a grand-taxi ride south past clay-red Berber villages camouflaged amid the foothills. You can stop at Berber markets on Monday and Thursday for a glimpse of local life, and there is a Berber Museum en route which is more a shop for artefacts. A stylish stop for lunch with a view is the <strong> Hotel Restaurant Ramuntcha </strong> (Vall\u00e9e de L'Ourika, Aghbalou, tel: 114373).</p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p>Travelscene (020-8427 8800 <a href=\"http://www.travelscene.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.travelscene.co.uk</a>) organises weekend breaks in Marrakech for \u00a3408pp (based on two adults sharing) including return GB Airways flights from London Gatwick and two nights' B&amp;B at the five-star Imperial Borj Hotel.

  "<p>Midland walkers and climbers speeding west past Telford on the M54 towards Snowdonia always look out for the shaggy, wooded slopes of the Wrekin, towering away to the south. </p> <p>But this modest 1,335ft (407m) summit is usually ignored by those seeking the greater heights and challenges provided by Welsh rock - it has become merely a gigantic milestone on the road to Wales. But by dismissing it so easily, those summit-baggers are missing one of the finest viewpoints not just in the Midlands, but in the whole of Britain. </p> <p>Vincent Waite, author of Shropshire Hill Country, was of the opinion that if you climb no other hill in Shropshire, you must climb the Wrekin. Local writer HW Timperley agreed, reckoning that to the people of Shropshire, the Wrekin was \"as much a spirit as a hill\", and \"when you go to it, the underlying mood or feeling is that of a pilgrimage\". </p> <p>The Wrekin is both the symbol and the icon of the county, in much the same way that the rock formation of the Old Man of the Mountains has become New Hampshire's. If Shropshire had the honour of its own coin, as the New England state recently received, the Wrekin would have to be on it. \"To all friends round the Wrekin\" is still the rousing toast heard among Shropshire folk, and it remains the nostalgic symbol of home for all exiled Salopians. </p> <p>The reason for all this affection for what is, after all, not even the highest summit in this beautiful Border county, is that the Wrekin, which always proudly and significantly carries the definite article, is undoubtedly a hill with a presence. It rises so sharply and unexpectedly from the pastoral Severn Plain that it forces you to notice it. </p> <p>There are few mountains in Britain, let alone hills, that have exerted the same powerful influence or sense of place on its surrounding communities. Perhaps Glastonbury Tor, towering over the willow-dotted Somerset Levels, is the nearest parallel. </p> <p>Geologically speaking, the Wrekin is formed of some of the oldest rocks in Britain, and indeed the world. The lovely, purple-pink and green pastel shades of the Wrekin's Cambrian and Pre-Cambrian rocks go back to the very dawn of the planet, perhaps as much as 2bn years. In the case of the fossil-free Pre-Cambrian, that is before evidence of life itself. </p> <p>The Wrekin takes its name from the British name of the Roman town of Wroxeter, known to the Romans as Viroconium, whose impressive remains lie about five miles to the west. The British people living near here were known as the Wrocensaetan, or the people of the Wrekin, and the earthworks surrounding its airy summit enclose a 20-acre hill fort dating from the Iron Age. You can imagine the Wrocensaetan watching in wonder as the Romans constructed their ruler-straight imperial highway of Watling Street (now the A5) across the lowlands beneath. </p> <p>You expect a hill like the Wrekin to attract its fair share of legends, and you're not disappointed. Perhaps the most popular folk story of its origin involves a wicked Welsh giant (or, in some versions, the Devil) who had a grudge against the people of the county town of Shrewsbury. He set off with a great load of earth with which he intended to dam the River Severn and so flood the town and drown all its inhabitants. </p> <p>On his way, he met a cobbler carrying over his shoulder a sackful of boots to repair, and he asked him directions to Shrewsbury. The cobbler, realising the giant's evil intention, claimed that he'd just walked from Shrewsbury himself, and had worn out his entire load of boots in so doing. The giant groaned in despair and dumped his load of earth where he stood to form the Wrekin. </p> <p>Another legend tells of two warring giants who were building the Wrekin from soil they had dug from the bed of the Severn. They quarrelled and one killed the other, burying him under the northern outlier of Ercall Hill from whence, it is said, he can still be heard groaning at the dead of night. </p> <p>We start our ascent of the Wrekin in the shadow of Ercall Hill, where there is limited lay-by parking at Forest Glen or in the disused quarry on Ercall Lane. Walk south along the lane that links Cluddley and Little Wenlock for about a mile until you see a stile on the right leading by the side of Wenlock Wood towards the wooded eastern slopes of the Wrekin. </p> <p>The woodland path crosses a farm track and eventually you reach a broad forest track which is followed left for about half a mile through avenues of stately beeches around the base of the hill. At a junction of paths at Little Hill, marked by a prominent yew tree, turn right and embark upon the steep climb through the trees directly up the south-western spur of the Wrekin. </p> <p>You will soon emerge from the trees on the broad, stony track formed by those ancient rocks; then head for the obvious rocky outcrop known as the Needle's Eye. Legend has it that this cleft in the rocks was caused when one of those fighting giants threw his spade into the ground. There is a direct route from Eaton Constantine to the summit through this narrow slit, but it is only for the experienced scrambler. </p> <p>You feel like you are on the roof of the Midlands, and the 360-degree view from the summit of the Wrekin, complete with circular toposcope, is breathtaking, said to take in no less than 17 counties. In clear conditions, you should be able to make out the blue outline of the Malvern Hills 40 miles to the south; the neighbouring Shropshire summits of the Clee Hills, wooded Wenlock Edge and the long whaleback of the Long Mynd, fronted by the shark's tooth of Caer Caradoc to the south west; and the misty shapes of the Berwyns, the first hills of Wales, filling the western horizon 30 miles away. Nearer at hand, due south, are the smoking cooling towers and chimney at Buildwas, which stand at the entrance to the Severn Gorge; Coalbrookdale and Iron Bridge, birthplaces of the Industrial Revolution, are just downstream. </p> <p>The well-trodden track now leads gradually down towards the northern end of the hill, passing a radio mast and through first Heaven's Gate and then Hell's Gate, which mark the entrances to the Iron Age hillfort that rings the summit. Significantly perhaps, it is Heaven's Gate which is the narrower. </p> <p>Dropping down off the hill, you descend through the trees of AE Housman's \"forest-fleeced\" Wrekin, past a cottage to return to Ercall Lane. Follow this back to the start near the small reservoir at the foot of Lawrence Hill, the third of the named Wrekin foothills. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> The Wrekin lies about five miles west of Telford, on the minor road between Cluddley and Little Wenlock. The walk is about five miles (8km), easy woodland walking, followed by a stiffish climb to the summit. Allow about three hours. The best map is Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 Landranger sheet 127: Stafford and Telford. Recommended pub: The Huntsman in Little Wenlock.

  "<p>With snow already on the horizon and the choices of how to get to it greater than ever, the task of planning a wintersports holiday is a daunting affair. It is not just a case of where, when, with whom and how much, but also how you should go about it. </p> <p>The vast majority of ski holidays will be sold by the six largest tour operators, Crystal (now owned by Thomson), Inghams, Airtours, Thomson, First Choice and Neilson. Crystal alone goes to 110 resorts in 11 countries. Add to that another 150 specialist operators and your choice more than doubles to over 300 resorts around the world. </p> <p>Independent travel to resorts used to be a costly and inconvenient option. But now with low-cost airlines, easy-to-arrange transfers, and accommodation that can be booked on the internet, the equation has changed. </p> <p>There are numerous self-drive options, particularly to destinations in France and Switzerland, while the Eurostar now has a Friday overnight departure from Waterloo which gives you an extra day's skiing. </p> <p>Don't restrict your options by going to a high-street travel agent. Their brochure choice is limited and geared towards the large tour operators, which often own the agency. </p> <p>AITO (The Association of Independent Tour Operators, 020-8744 9280) produces an annual ski directory listing 28 ski companies covering 178 resorts in nine countries. </p> <p>There are two good ski and snowboarding guide books - Where to Ski and Snowboard 2001 (NortonWood Publishing, \u00a315.99) and The Good Skiing &amp; Snowboarding Guide 2001 (Which? \u00a315.99).

  "<p>Harold Pinter was 70 this week. The occasion was marked by his publisher, Faber and Faber, who threw a party at which they genuinely surprised him. They presented him with a new book, Harold Pinter: A Celebration, comprising essays by friends and colleagues that brim with anecdotes, impressions and recollections which go some way towards explaining Pinter's creative durability. </p> <p>\"The old bull surges on,\" writes his friend Henry Woolf: it's a good image. Though we can all think of exceptions such as Goethe, Shaw and Miller, most dramatists by 70 are either dead, quiescent or exhausted. Writing plays is a cruelly draining business in that it depends upon life experience, which tends to thin out once the dramatist has achieved celebrity. Pinter, however, has kept body and soul in good repair. </p> <p>What comes out of the book is Pinter's blend of English and European traditions. Simon Gray perceptively relates him to Dickens. But David Hare also sharply observes, \"he was a man who had read and absorbed European ideas and who wanted to explode them, with a terrifying bang, into English working-class settings\".</p> <p>That seems to me precisely true. In The Birthday Party you feel the spirit of Kafka has descended on a crummy English seaside town. In a work like The Hothouse, set in a sinister state-run institution, Sartre meets music-hall cross-talk. I even remember the German director Peter Zadek saying to me, when he directed Moonlight in Berlin, that it was like \"a mixture of Beckett and Agatha Christie\". </p> <p>Pinter's plays are profoundly English yet also linked, through his reading and Jewish ancestry, to the cross-currents of European history. That in itself raises the thorny issue of Pinter's politics. The kind of overtly political plays Pinter has been writing since 1985 - specifically One for the Road, Mountain Language, Party Time and Ashes to Ashes - are often treated in Britain with patronising condescension if not downright hostility. His articles and speeches on political issues are given even scanter consideration: they are often seen as symptoms of the angry playwright sounding off. But I would argue that Pinter's political works are a crucial part of his oeuvre and the source of his continuing vitality: at an age when most artists withdraw into private life, Pinter is impelled by a moral rage at injustice, cruelty and hypocrisy. </p> <p>Numerous arguments are raised against Pinter's political plays. One is that they stem from a position of certainty, whereas good drama is fuelled by doubt. It is true that Nietzsche said \"convictions are prisons\" but it is historical nonsense to suggest that drama can only exist in an ideological vacuum: from Aristophanes to Arthur Miller, playwrights have written out of moral passion.</p> <p>What lifts Pinter's plays above the simplicities of agit-prop is that they imaginatively occupy enemy territory: Nicolas, the agent of state repression in One for the Road, is an extraordinary creation in that he is both a vicarious torturer and yet a man who seeks validation from his victims. It is not that Pinter sees both sides of the argument: what he presents us with is the vulnerability of power. </p> <p>Another stock objection - raised only last week in a fierce debate on Radio 4's Front Row - is that Pinter depicts Britain as a totalitarian state: in Party Time, a cocktail party is accompanied by street round-ups, and in Ashes to Ashes, Dorset is invoked in the context of mass destruction. But this is based on a lazy misreading of the plays. Nowhere does Pinter state or even suggest that modern Britain is morally equivalent to Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia. What he does do, by the use of local references, is to shock us out of our smug assumption that western democracies are exemplars of virtue or that repressive regimes have a monopoly on evil. His political plays are, in part, early-warning systems against the erosion of our liberties; and, at a time when one political party has advocated the automatic incarceration of all asylum-seekers, his warnings are hardly gratuitous. </p> <p>Perhaps it shouldn't surprise one that Pinter's political plays, after brief runs at the Almeida or the Royal Court, are largely ignored in the rest of Britain. But they certainly do their work in the world at large. I saw Ashes to Ashes in New York, where, paradoxically, its Englishness was more visibly apparent and it stilled even the congenital Manhattanite coughers and scratchers. I shall also never forget seeing One for the Road in Spain, where the interrogatory Nicolas at one point held a silence for several minutes as if to emphasise the playful arbitrariness of power, a point a post-Franco audience shudder ingly understood. And Richard Eyre says the most powerful political theatre he has ever seen was a play about \"persecution, freedom, fear and kindness\" staged in Prague in 1969 shortly after the Russian invasion. It was called The Birthday Party. </p> <p>There are many aspects to Pinter's achievement as a dramatist. He has made poetry out of demotic speech. He has banished the idea of the omniscient author by showing that characters have an unresolved existence at which we can only guess. More than any living dramatist, he has also shown that memory is one of the most potent forces in human life. His latest play, Celebration, seen in some quarters simply as a snobbish attack on the restaurant-haunting nouveau riche, was actually about contrasting memories. For the diners, it was highly selective and rooted in sensual gratification; for the young waiter, it was something capable of infinite, mysterious perspectives. But although there is a lot of Pinter to come this autumn - The Caretaker in the West End, Remembrance of Things Past at the National, The Homecoming at the Comedie Fran\u00e7aise - I hope someone somewhere will take a second look at his neglected political plays. They seem to me the real key to Pinter's ongoing vitality. Ben Jonson once said that \"a just anger puts life in a man\". And if Pinter at 70 is the opposite of an extinct volcano, I suspect it is because writing is for him an extension of an ungovernable moral passion. </p> <p>\u0095 Harold Pinter: A Celebration is published by Faber and Faber, price \u00a37.99.</p>"
