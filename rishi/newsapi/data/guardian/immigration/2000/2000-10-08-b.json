  "Triumphing over extreme cold, treacherous ice and people dismissing him as mad, Slovenian Davo Karnicar yesterday became the first person to ski non-stop down Mount Everest. <p>After a dramatic plummet over almost sheer cliffs of snow, boulders and ice, 38-year-old Karnicar emerged exhausted but exhilarated in his base camp after five hours of skiing that gave new meaning to the words off piste. </p> <p>At one stage he had to speed over stretches of ice that collapsed and broke underneath him and could have sent him tumbling into the deep crevasses that dot the mountain. </p> <p>'I feel only absolute happiness and absolute fatigue,' he said after his successful run landed him in the record books and notched another in a series of bizarre firsts for conquerors of Everest that already includes launching a paraglider from the 8,850-metre summit. </p> <p>The descent by the father of three had been seen by many as insanely dangerous. The Darwin Awards website, which documents and applauds foolhardy deaths, called the descent 'madness' and urged people to log onto internet broadcasts of the attempt. 'Keep your eyes peeled for a live Darwin Award,' it said. </p> <p>However, the only body to make news yesterday was a corpse of an unknown mountaineer which Karnicar zipped past as he descended, one of an estimated 120 cadavers thought to litter the slopes. For Karnicar it was a reminder of the potential perils of his sport, but it did not stop him. </p> <p>'This mountain is always full of surprises, seeing a dead man out there was a really shocking experience,' he said. </p> <p>Thanks to strategically placed cameras on the mountain and one attached to his safety helmet, hundreds of thousands of people in more than 70 countries witnessed his descent on the internet. During the run more than 650,000 hits were registered on the expedition website - <a href=\"http://www.everest.simobil.si\" target=\"_NEW\">www.everest.simobil.si</a> - jamming it for a time as others tried to access the site. </p> <p>Those successful in logging on shared in the drama. At one stage Karnicar prompted deep concern after he failed to radio in to his support team just before he negotiated a notorious outcrop called the Hillary Step. But there had been no disaster. It was just the extreme weather hampering the operation of his radio batteries. </p> <p>In fact the conditions were so severe that he abandoned plans to rest on the summit before attempting to descend. Instead, suffering from fatigue, as soon as he reached the top he put on his skis and flung himself back down the mountain. </p> <p>He had already skied down Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn, the Eiger and Annapurna, but Everest was the last great challenge of the extreme side of the skiing world. </p> <p>Tackling the mountain had already cost Karnica two fingers in 1996 when a failed attempt saw him get frostbite as a fierce storm lashed the peak. </p> <p>Karnicar comes from an illustrious skiing family in Slovenia and took part in his first Himalayan skiing expedition in 1989. Since than he has been tireless in raising funds and sponsorship for more expeditions, with Everest as the eventual goal. </p> <p>'Extreme skiing, is my sport, my thinking and life itself,' he said. </p> <p> <b>Mountain of facts</b> <br>Compiled by Dorota Nosowicz </p> <p><b>Age:</b> About 60 million years old</p> <p><b>Elevation: </b> 29,035ft (8,850m).

  "On 3 September you published an article on the future ethnic composition of the UK. Your newspaper consulted me by telephone on speculative claims, from political sources, of which I was previously ignorant, that there could be a white minority in the UK in 100 years' time. <p>In paraphrase I was happy to be quoted to the effect that, first, it is simple arithmetic that any group growing at a faster rate than others must eventually become the majority if growth rates remain constant and if the group(s) retain their identity. </p> <p>Second, the suppositions behind such extrapolation are likely to change; the birth rate of immigrant groups may well converge to national average; immigration is, at least in theory, under government control. </p> <p>As I made clear to your newspaper, no 'analysis' or 'calculation' has been made from 'official' or other sources, other than the elementary extrapolation of current estimated growth rates which anyone can do. <br><b> David Coleman </b><br> Reader in Demography <br> University of Oxford</p>",
  "<p>Herbert Ypma has one of the most enviable of lives. He spends his days researching glossy, coffee table books about hotels and interiors. His Hip Hotels series has given him the perfect reason (as if any were needed) to travel to exotic and far-flung destinations and check into some of the world's most luxurious and stylish hotels. His books on interiors and architecture have taken him from Mexico to Morocco, where he photographs kasbahs, mud castles, hotels and markets, designed to inspire, and make his readers dream. In Sweden, he has explored the Ice Hotel which is allowed to melt each year and is then rebuilt; in Chile, he has sought out the remote Hotel Explora, perched high above a waterfall in the wilds of Patagonia.</p> <p>Needless to say, he's a hard man to track down. His publishers never know quite where he is, or where he might be going. He himself is not quite sure where he lives anymore. Hip Hotels France will be out next spring. Right now he's working on the next volume of Hip Hotels, an edition devoted to interesting and unusual places to stay for between \u00a320 and \u00a380. </p> <p>In between Hip Hotels, however, Ypma has been spending quite a lot of time in Paris, working on his new book, The Paris Interior, to be published in early November. The aim of the book, he says, was to define the very essence of the Parisian interior. There are mountains of books out there covering everything from Paris apartments, monuments, caf\u00e9s and restaurants to bridges and metro stations, but they all, he says, miss the point. His idea was to spell out the precise elements that add up to the typical Parisian interior. </p> <p>'Whether in an ad for perfume or a film by the likes of Polanski or Bertolucci,' he writes in the introduction, 'we recognise a Parisian setting before we are told - if indeed we are told at all. Why? Because there is a visual language at play that is unique to Paris.' It starts with the Louis XVI chair, and goes right through to the wooden panels of the boiserie, integral to most apartments in the city. </p> <p>'You cannot separate the history of Paris and its interiors,' he explains on the phone during a brief touchdown somewhere in France. 'There are definite things that you can pinpoint as Parisian style.' Element number one is undoubtedly the Louis XVI chair. 'It's an incredibly well-designed piece of furniture,' he says, a design classic that is simultaneously of its time and timeless, more popular now (in terms of numbers produced) than at the time of the Bourbons. Then, the nobility would muse over the design and detail of their specially commissioned chair for days on end. It was their status symbol, in the same way as a certain car or handbag might be today.</p> <p>'It was a period when furniture manufacturing was briefly elevated to the status of high art,' he writes. Each chair would have been painstakingly hand-made by specialist craftsmen. Louis XV's bureau du roi took a team of craftspeople seven years to finish, and every chair that was commissioned for his palace would have been given the same treatment. </p> <p>It is this understanding and love of the art and craft of furniture that has helped to define the Parisian style. In Britain, the Industrial Revolution was all about mass-production and cutting costs. In France, however, there was a culture of making large numbers of a product, but by hand - irrespective of the amount it would cost or the time it would take. There is an ingrained love of luxury, although today it is the style and shape of the furniture made for Louis XV and XVI that are imitated, rather than the quality of the craftsman-ship. 'It is almost impossible to conceive of a stylish Paris interior without its Louis XV or Louis XVI chairs: whether upholstered with tapestry or plain silk, they can be found in almost every grand hotel or chic apartment.' Oh, and if you are wondering, the way to i tell the difference between Louis XV and XVI is simple: just take a look at the legs. </p> <p>The earlier king favoured curved legs, while Louis XVI preferred his straight and tapered. </p> <p>Paris interiors did not end with the 18th century, however. According to Ypma, they are very much alive and well today. Alongside the elements of style guaranteed to make an appearance in the Parisian apartment, including the clock, ('They were such objects of desire,' he says. 'If you commissioned a clock, you would have it made in your style'), chinoiserie, wood panelling, parquet floors, and the odd touch of the rococo, is the objet trouv\u00e9. </p> <p>'I think history can be really intriguing and fascinating,' says Ypma. 'An apartment without something from the past lacks a story.' And the perfect place to find something with a story is the flea market. Paris has several, from Clignancourt to Porte de Montreuil, each throwing up a seemingly endless supply of antiques, junk, novelties and - a favourite of Ypma's - copper pots. Sunday mornings are the time to go out in search of that Louis chair, the little crystal chandelier, or the baroque candlestick. The more faded and distressed, the better. It's all about character and eclecticism; bringing the interiors and furniture of the past to life by mixing unusual pieces, and making something out of nothing. </p> <p>Although Ypma himself does not have a Paris apartment, he has had no shortage of rooms to inspire him. He visits the city about 20 times a year, and is, of course, no stranger to some of the best and most characterful hotels. There's the Montalambert on the Left Bank, which he says is 'pretty, small and elegantly designed'; L'Hotel, near the Ecole des Beaux Arts, where all the rooms are different and 'very funky, if a little run down'; or the Lancaster, which is more traditional and classical. Even if he doesn't know where he is going to be from one week to the next, one thing is for sure: wherever he is in Paris, he can feel secure that there will be a Louis XVI chair to rest his weary, well-travelled legs.</p>",
  "<p>The man from the Intelligence Bureau wanted to know exactly what I was up to in Multan. He had spotted me walking through the bazaar with my host, Moin, and had been so alarmed at the spectacle that he had rung Moin at his family home at eight the next morning. Moin, the director of a local non-governmental organisation, is no friend of the military dictatorship, and is accustomed to low-level harassment from the authorities. I heard him assure the secret policeman that I was merely a 'writer of cricket stories' and that my visit had nothing to do with politics. This wasn't strictly true but I was happy to bow to Moin's preference for discretion over valour.</p> <p>'That man is very happy now,' Moin informed me. 'Cricket is the best passport you can have in Pakistan.' </p> <p>Multan in the southern Punjab is renowned for heat, flies and beggars, but in the early spring it's a balmy place, with a dilapidated medieval centre speckled with blue-glazed Sufi shrines. That day I drove south through a landscape of shady canals, green fields and mango orchards. In nearby Bahawalpur I visited the Dring Stadium, the country's oldest international cricket ground, where Hanif Mohammed scored the first Test century on Pakistani soil in 1954.</p> <p>Little of note has taken place there since. The one-day international circus rarely alights at the Dring which, like southern Punjab as a whole, seems a victim of discrimination and neglect. Nonetheless, it remains an attractive ground with a 1930s pavilion. While the malis weeded the outfield, the surrounding gardens and alleyways were packed with boys playing cricket. Barefoot fast bowlers with whippy actions hurled battered composite balls at batsmen who played shots all around the wicket. There's no academy in Pakistan, no development system, but young prodigies keep bubbling up from below. </p> <p>In Bahawalpur, as elsewhere in Pakistan, I was interrogated with polite determination. What was my opinion of the Pakistani cricket team? Since it was obvious that Pakistan had the world's most talented cricketers, why did the team lose so often? Why did they keep changing the captain? Who could explain the selection policies? In sum, what was wrong with Pakistani cricket? As elsewhere, they didn't need me to tell them the answers. They muttered about corruption, mismanagement, favouritism, factionalism. Their contempt for the rulers of Pakistani cricket was as fierce as their pride in the brilliance of Pakistani cricketers. I asked them who would win tomorrow's one day international against Sri Lanka.</p> <p>'Pakistan, of course,' said a studious-looking wicketkeeper in glasses and baseball cap, then added, 'unless...' and rubbed his fingers together in the universal sign for the bottom line.</p> <p>The next day I made my way into the Cholistan desert. In a remote village there was an annual mela, an immemorial gathering of the clans around the sand dune shrine of a folk saint. Transvestites dance and smile. Nomadic families are camped out with their animals, cooking and chatting in the sun. Singers and drummers keep up an endless rhythmic drone. A group of boys squatting next to a herd of young camels listen to a small radio broadcasting the ball by ball from Karachi. I approach and ask the score. Pakistan are batting well. They are making a big score. But then, a wicket falls. There's a burst of excited static from the radio. The boys fiddle with the tuner. They shake their heads. One looks at me with a grim smile and rubs his fingers together.</p> <p>To grasp the impact of the cascade of match-fixing rumours and revelations in Pakistan and India, you first have to grasp the importance of cricket within south Asian culture. Imagine the British interest in football, rugby, cricket, tennis, golf, snooker and athletics all rolled into one, then add in pop music and television soaps, and you begin to get the scale. Sachin Tendulkar has been repeatedly named not only as the most widely recognised living Indian, but also the most respected. In England, it's a rare occurrence for an event in the cricket world to hit the front-pages. In India and Pakistan, it's routine. India has the second largest population in the world, and Pakistan the sixth, but they barely featured in the medal winners' table in Sydney. For societies eager for a hike in global status, cricket is a rare and welcome balm, a compensation as well as a distraction. In this field alone they have produced world-beaters, so when the world-beaters' probity and patriotism comes into question, emotions run high. </p> <p>'The automatic equation between brilliant-cricketer-therefore-brilliant-human-being is a difficult one to break,' says Sharda Ugra, sports editor at India Today, the country's biggest English language weekly. On her way back from reporting on the King Commission inquiry into the Hanise Cronje scandal in South Africa (the magazine's cover story), she found herself trying to explain to incredulous cricket lovers some painful realities about one of India's greatest sporting heroes, the all-rounder (and until recently, national coach) Kapil Dev. 'It took me the better part of three hours to convince two people sitting next to me in the plane that Kapil might be involved in the scandals. When I told him about all the times that Kapil had refused to do interviews if he wasn't paid, this middle-aged businessman could only say, \"But he is my hero!\"</p> <p>'The die hard fans are still struggling with the fact that their heroes could be guilty of doing what Cronje did,' says Ugra. 'But the newer followers, that section of the population that had switched during the past 10 years from being totally uninterested in cricket to being riveted by the television spectacle, a lot of them female, retired people, are now disgusted and put off. It is this lot who have made what I call the \"reality-switch\" very quickly.' </p> <p>Perhaps the saddest feature of the whole affair is that so few people in India believe anything will come of it. After all, scandals of much greater import to Indian society - and involving greater sums of money and equally famous names - have come and gone with the culprits still at large. No one ever faced trial in either the Bofors or Hawala scams, which were considered political earthquakes in their day. The rich and well-connected, it seems, will always escape justice. While the Indian criminal justice system grinds slowly, sponsors and advertisers have been quicker to pass judgment. Suddenly the ubiquitous adverts featuring famous cricketers plugging everything from air conditioners to men's suits have vanished from the screen. A recent television advert gives some idea of the prevailing mood. It shows four people sitting around watching cricket on the box. The screen flickers and the picture is distorted. One of the viewers gets up and says the cable must have shifted.</p> <p>'Match fix kar doon?' ('shall I fix the match?'), he asks. His friend answers that there's no need; the problem can be 'fixed' from a seated position - and then extols the television's new remote control features.</p> <p>There's a wary cynicism in the popular response to the match-fixing scandal, but it doesn't seem to have reduced the popular appetite for cricket. Vendors of cricket equipment insist the scandal has had no impact on sales and the demand for places in cricket clubs and coaching clinics is as insatiable as ever. Since the ICC Knock-Out Trophy currently under way in Kenya will be the first international cricket played by India since the scandal broke in April, it remains to be seen whether television audiences have kept faith with the game. </p> <p>People in India can't seem to make up their minds whether Manoj Prabhakar is a hero or villain in the match-fixing melodrama. The former Indian all-rounder was always known as a member of the awkward squad, and had already made his share of enemies long before he began muttering about bookies and bribes in 1997. His allegations were investigated by the Chandrachud Commission and dismissed as unfounded.</p> <p>Earlier this year, following Cronje's confession, Prabhakar equipped himself with a hidden camera and videotaped a number of private conversations with players and administrators. The explosive results were aired on Indian television in May. One after another, cricketers, broadcasters, coaches and cricket board members confirm Prabhakar's allegations. One after another, they concede that match-fixing is 'going on all the time' but that 'there is nothing you can do about it'.</p> <p>'Prabhakar's videotapes have had a huge impact on the non-believers,' Ugra observes. 'A lot of us knew there was antagonism and backbiting and insecurity within cricket, like there is in any sport, but there were plenty who gave cricketers the benefit of the doubt. I think no one could predict the extent of the rot.'</p> <p>One of the documentary's saddest, most revealing moments occurs in a conversation between Prabhakar and Navjot Singh Sidhu, the former Indian opening batsman, a gritty crease-occupier and, like Prabhakar, renowned as a difficult customer. On the tape, Sidhu makes it clear that while he does not dispute Prabhakar's allegations, he must turn down his old friend's pleas to back him in public. 'I know you very well, but first listen to me. Even if you go to someone else, he will not go along with you. Nobody. After all, Kapil Dev is not an ordinary person. He is a respected man in this country. Highly respected. If you lift a finger against a respected man and you don't have proof, it's like inviting trouble. Secondly, I'm indebted to Kapil Paaji. He gave me an opportunity to play no matter what kind of person he is. I owe him a debt. I don't want to be dragged into this. I don't get involved in any matter, leave alone a matter of this importance. They (journalists) call me everyday. I don't even say,\"'No comments\".'</p> <p>Sidhu's paranoia, like Prabhakar's whiny desperation, tell us a great deal about big-time Indian cricket. This is a climate in which patronage and personal favour count, in which success on the field is never enough. It is not a climate in which whistle-blowers flourish.</p> <p>As a result of the Prabhakar tapes and King Commission testimony, India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) stepped up its probe and in mid-July the Income Tax department launched high-profile raids on cricketers and cricket board personnel. With a characteristically south Asian nostalgia for the game's lost innocence, tax officials dubbed the raids 'Operation Gentleman'.</p> <p>From Kapil Dev to the former chairman of the International Cricket Council, Jagmohan Dalmiya, few were spared. Although the information gathered is still under review and no charges have been brought, newspapers have printed lurid accounts of the eye-popping wealth uncovered in the course of the raids. If nothing else, the press leaks have re-inforced the popular conviction that corruption in the game is widespread. 'I am delighted that these raids took place,' said Khushwant Singh, one of the country's best-known columnists. 'Personally, I am relieved. I have stopped watching cricket altogether.'</p> <p>Whatever they may add by way of circumstantial evidence in the match-fixing cases, in themselves the raids merely confirm that international cricketers are no different from other rich Indians. The hoarding of undeclared assets is standard practise among the country's *lite. For that *lite, there is now a growing danger that the match-fixing scandal will overspill its boundaries. Jaya Jaitly, the president of the Samata party, a partner in the governing coalition, held a press conference in Delhi to denounce the 'high-handed' raid on the homes and offices of Ajay Jadeja, the middle-class heart throb with the princely pedigree who has been repeatedly named in connection with the scandals. Jaitly's daughter works for Jadeja and is said to be engaged to marry him. The politician took particular umbrage over the 'personal' questioning of her daughter ('by my own government') and accused the tax officials of asking for 50,000 rupees (\u00a3750) to hush up the case. 'They asked for food and demanded rotis made at home, not bazaar stuff.'</p> <p>In the wake of the tax raids, both Muhammad Azharuddin and Kapil Dev were interrogated by the CBI. They were also named frequently in Prabhakar's tapes. Imagine Kevin Keegan and Gary Lineker in the dock, and you'll get a small idea of how the heavens have fallen in the sub-continent. </p> <p>I first laid eyes on Muhammad Azharuddin at Eden Gardens in January 1985, when the then 21-year-old neophyte compiled a measured Test century against England. The crowd that day - full to its 100,000 capacity, patient, knowledgeable, appreciative - seems to belong to a different world to the crowds that surge into the grounds for today's one-day internationals - feverishly partisan, quickly bored, and mostly indifferent to anything other than national victory. </p> <p>And apart from the still flexible wrists, the world-weary, besieged celebrity who turned out for Asia against the Rest of the World at the Oval this summer seems a very different person from the modest, tongue-tied, unworldly lad who put the English bowlers to the sword at Eden Gardens. In those days, he shared a home in a low-income housing colony in Hyderabad with 17 other family members. Today, according to the reports leaked from the income tax raids, he is the owner of seven luxury properties in Bombay, six imported vehicles, 20 designer wristwatches and several closets worth of Armani and Versace togs. </p> <p>At the Oval, every time Azhar touched the ball, the crowd let fly. 'Account number kya hai?' (What is your account number?). When he fluffed a catch in the slips, it was 'Payment late?'. The umpires were urged to 'check his pockets!'. Compared to what is likely to greet him in India, if he ever plays cricket there again, it was mild.</p> <p>Azhar was named by Cronje to the King Commission as his initial link man with the bookies, nd on the Prabhakar tape Ravi Shastri, the former Indian all-rounder turned TV commentator, describes him as 'the asshole' who 'must be shifted'. Panicked by the rising tide of accusation, Azhar did something he had resisted in the past; he played the minority card, claiming that he was being singled out for attack because he was a Muslim.</p> <p>Azhar captained India through much of the 1990s, a period that coincided with the rising influence of a right-wing Hindu nationalism pumping out an ugly anti-Muslim message. Like other Muslims prominent in the entertainment world, he went out of his way to assert his patriotic credentials and in particular his desire to defeat Pakistan on the field of play. Hindu bigots heaped praise on him for showing the country what a 'loyal Muslim' should be. However, he was already being criticised by conservatives - both Muslim and Hindu - for his divorce and subsequent marriage to Sangeeta Bijlani, a Bombay model. On the outside, Azhar remained a diffident figure. But those who know him insist he changed. The globe-trotting, the lavish lifestyle, the adoring crowds, the easy money are all blamed for ruining the one time innocent.</p> <p>Azhar also suffers from a subliminal association with the 'Muslim underground', the criminal empire said to be run by Dawood Ibrahim from his safe haven in the Gulf. There is little that goes wrong in India that some people are not prepared to lay at Dawood's doorstep; his alleged links with just about every powerful figure in Indian life - from politics to cinema to sport - keep conspiracy theorists working overtime. As the Prabhakar tapes confirmed, Dawood is a real presence in cricket, and has appeared in both the Indian and Pakistani dressing rooms. But if there is a specific link between Azhar and Dawood - as former Indian captain Ravi Shastri alleges in the Prabhakar tapes - it has nothing to do with Islam and everything to do with money.</p> <p>Azhar is a creature of the culture of individual acquisitiveness that swept through the upper echelons of Indian society in the 1990s. In business, politics and culture, it was the decade of hype and hustle, a scramble for scarce privileges in a poverty-blighted society. A packaged patriotism was married to a deregulated business environment, and Azhar was only one of many pulled into the resultant maelstrom. </p> <p>As rumour followed rumour, Kapil Dev found his hitherto unchallenged public standing hopelessly compromised. Journalists began publishing some of the things they had already known for a long time, particularly about Kapil's business affairs. The Gujerat state government announced that it was ordering the removal from school text books of a chapter celebrating the great all-rounder. In early September, Kapil was interrogated by the CBI, and pressure built up for him to resign as coach of the Indian team. This was a delicate matter for the cricket board. How do you rid yourself discreetly of a tainted national hero? Everyone wanted Kapil to go, but no one wanted to be seen to push him out. So the board reportedly floated rumours that it might be looking for a replacement, then publicly denied the rumours and invited Kapil to remain in charge. </p> <p>Besieged by the media, Kapil submitted his resignation, which was then accepted by the board with a show of regret. Privately, it had been made clear to Kapil that if he delayed any longer, he would have to be sacked. Sharda Ugra described the episode as 'a classic example of Indian cricket's theatre of the absurd' dictated by 'a tragi-comic compromise formula.' The legendary slow bowler and long-time loose cannon Bishen Bedi dismissed Kapil's exit as 'stage managed.' Indian captain Saurav Ganguly was surprisingly terse: 'Frankly, it doesn't matter who the coach is.' </p> <p>The board was said to be divided over how to handle Kapil's disgrace. Having excluded all those players named in the match-fixing imbroglio from the squad for the ICC Trophy (which meant no places for Azhar or Jadeja), it seemed strange that the axe should not also fall on the national coach. But then, the axe had also spared two other individuals involved in the tax raids - the powerful Dalmiya and the board treasurer Kishore Rungta. 'What happens to the board officers will indicate the intent and extent of Indian cricket's clean-up,' commented a still sceptical Ugra.</p> <p>As for Kapil, the once vivacious and uncomplicated competitor has slunk away from the public eye, wounded and bewildered. 'I cannot explain anything,' he told a journalist. 'You are free to write what you wish. I have nothing to say. Let me be. Please.'</p> <p>Shortly after Pakistan's elected government was ousted by a military dictatorship last year, Lt General Tauqir Zia was installed as head of the cricket board, assisted by a phalanx of army and air force personnel. For the current military rulers, cricket serves much the same purposes as it served their predecessors, generals Zia Ul Haq and Ayub Khan: an instrument for legitimising the regime and for distracting the masses. It is also, now, a means for the military to demonstrate its main justification in the eyes of the people - its claim that it will root out the corruption that bedevilled the civilian system. So far there's little evidence of improvement, in cricket or elsewhere. </p> <p>It was in Pakistan that the match-fixing scandal began in 1994, when Salim Malik was accused of attempted bribery by Shane Warne and Mark Waugh (who, it later emerged, had themselves accepted payment from bookies). Nearly six years later, after three inquiries supervised by the cream of the Pakistani judiciary, the result is that former captain Salim Malik and medium-pacer Ata-ur-Rehman have been banned for life (their international careers were finished in any case). Six others, including Wasim Akram, Saeed Anwar, Waqar Younis and Mushtaq Ahmed, have been fined amounts between $2,000 and $6,000. The fines will be deducted from their match fees. </p> <p>Judging by the published reports, the case against Akram seemed much weightier than the one made out against Ata-ur-Rehman. Akram remains, however, a key member of the side. Colonel (Retd) Rafi Nasim, a former head of the cricket board and now a columnist for a daily newspaper, declared that the fines 'will act as a last nail in the coffin of match fixing as far as Pakistan is concerned. Of all the countries allegedly involved in this evil practice Pakistan was the most prompt as well as logical in dealing with this issue.' Not everyone agrees. A citizen has lodged a petition in the Sindh High Court calling for all the players named in the final report to be banned from the game and prosecuted for criminal offences. </p> <p>Turning from tragedy to farce, Pakistani cricket has recently been rocked by one of its rare sex scandals. Or at least that' s how the local press have reported it. Three promising international cricketers were found in the company of of a number of young women in the team's Karachi hotel rooms on the eve of their flight to a tournament in Singapore. The players insisted that the women were fans who had barged their way in, and the manager says his investigation confirms their story. Nonetheless, they have each been fined \u00a3800 and banned from the ICC tournament in Kenya. Lt General Zia explained: 'I had to strike a balance as PCB chairman and that I did without destroying the careers of the players. I have penalised the players for their indiscretion although there was no evidence against them.' </p> <p>So although the alleged perpetrators of this poor excuse for a sex scandal were declared innocent, they were still fined some two thirds of the amount that was levied on players acused, and found guilty, of match-fixing. The popular all-rounder Shahid Afridi, one of the three players who may or may not have committed a minor misdemeanour in the Karachi hotel, bewailed his predicament. 'My father, mother and brothers have been very critical of my actions. They have been reprimanding me. None of them are ready to believe me. I am at a loss as to what my action should be. </p> <p>Those who raised this false allegation have managed to establish it as a truth. However, I can swear by God to prove my innocence.' Unfortunately for Afridi, many Pakistani (and Indian) cricketers have made similar declarations in recent years, and too often they have proved hollow....</p> <p>Today, in India and Pakistan, people follow the unfolding match-fixing scandals, and see in cricket a vivid picture of a malaise that blights both their societies: the lawlessness of the rich, the unaccountability of the powerful, the cynical manipulation of public institutions and popular spectacles for private gain. But that is not all they see in cricket. </p> <p>If the England players make the most of their opportunities, what they'll experience once they've wandered outside the luxury hotel perimeter is the world's most fervent grass-roots cricket culture. It's only when you watch a gang of raggedy kids construct a wicket from a couple of bricks on a gravel-strewn vacant lot next to a shanty town, and then watch them play a pick-up game with fire and flair worthy of a one-day international, that you realise the creative intensity of south Asian cricket, and the scale of its betrayal. </p> <p>\u0095 Mike Marqusee is the author of Redemption Song: Muhammad Ali and the Spirit of the Sixties (Verso, paperback) which has been voted one of 25 'Books to Remember, 1999' by the New York Public Library.</p> <p><strong>The accused and the accusers </strong></p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong><br>The King Commission of Inquiry set up after the Hansie Cronje revelations in April heard extensive testimony from players and officials indicating the extent of matchfixing in international cricket. It was revealed that the entire South African team held a meeting to discuss whether or not to accept bribes to throw a match in 1996. As a result of its preliminary findings, Herschelle Gibbs and Henry Williams were banned from international cricket for six months. Gibbs was fined \u00a36,000 and Williams \u00a31,000. Meanwhile King Commission chief prosecutor Shamila Batohi has visited India to exchange information (and tape recordings) with the Indian police. Further investigations are currently under way and a final report is still pending.</p> <p><strong>Pakistan</strong><br>After much delay, Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum's report into matchfixing was published in May. As a result of its recommendations, Salim Malik and Ata-ur-Rehman were banned for life; six other leading internationals - including Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, and Saeed Anwar - were fined $2,000-$6,000. Akram is considering an appeal. According to the report, he was given 'the benefit of the doubt' but is now 'too sullied' to serve as captain and should be kept under 'strict vigilance' while a further probe is made into his finances.</p> <p><strong>India</strong><br>The Central Bureau of Investigation is now said to be finalising its mammoth report, which should be made available to the Sports Minister this month. It may implicate at least two Indian cricketers and several foreigners in illegal activities. The selecters decided not to wait for the report, and have already dropped four of the 'tainted' players - Muhammad Azharuddin (pictured above with his wife), Ajay Jadeja, Nikhil Chopra and Nayan Mongia - ostensibly 'on merit'. National team coach Kapil Dev has also been forced to resign.</p> <p><strong>Australia</strong><br>Shane Warne and Mark Waugh were fined for accepting money from bookmakers in 1995; the Australian Board hushed up the incident, which only became public in 1998.</p> <p><strong>England</strong><br>Have yet to make public their investigation into the match-fixing allegations made by Chris Lewis. It is rumoured that English cricketers may be among those to be named in the Indian CBI report.</p> <p><strong>ICC </strong><br>Cricket's governing body has established a Code of Conduct Commission, chaired by Lord Griffiths, a former High Court judge and president of the MCC. Paul Condon, the former Metropolitan Police commissioner, has been appointed a part-time corruption-buster, reporting to Griffiths. Griffiths and Condon are currently reviewing the Qayyum report to determine if further action is required.</p>",

  "<p>Florence is one of those great cultural cities where it is all too easy to get bogged down in guide book 'must see' recommendations, meaning that all you really do is go from sight to sight, spending interminable hours in queues that stretch outside the Renaissance Duomo to the masterpieces of the Uffizi, from the steps leading up to the medieval Palazzo Vecchio, to the 15 visitors at a time who are allowed in every half hour to witness the exceptional pastel frescoes decorating the Medici's chapel. </p> <p>But don't be fooled into thinking that Florence is a kind of living museum: far from it, there is a lively fashion industry here, craftsmen and artisans are flourishing rather than dying out, and there's a vast fun-loving student population, including thousands of foreigners who flock here either to learn Italian or study art. </p> <p>Florence has always been the capital, the birthplace, of Italian gastronomy, offering the chance to eat in grand gourmet restaurants or at the simple red-checked tablecloths of a typical trattoria. </p> <p>The city borders on the great vineyards of Chianti, and there is certainly no lack of wine bars to start trying the local vino, from rough and ready backstreet fiaschetterie bars, to a chic enoteca that will have dozens of wines ready to be tasted by the glass. </p> <p>So for at least a day or so, think shopping rather than sightseeing, be prepared for long, romantic meals rather than grabbing a quick pizza, and rather than collapsing in your hotel in the early evening, save some of your energy to sample Florence's newly revitalised nightlife scene. </p> <p>That way, you will at least have a feeling of having discovered the city of the Florentines rather than the guide book's Florence. </p> <p><strong> Shopping</strong></p> <p> <strong> Perfume</strong> <br> Officina Profumo Farmaceutica di Santa Maria Novella<br> Via della Scala 16. (0039 055 216 276) </p> <p>Dating back to the sixteenth century, when Dominican friars began experimenting with elixirs and potions, this is no simple 'pharmacy', but the world's oldest perfume maker, near Santa Maria Novella, one of the city's most famous churches. Walking into the frescoed chapel which serves as a showroom, the ambience is more like a museum than a shop, with scores of heady aromas. In the Heath Robinson-like workshops, artisans produce not just perfumes but herbal remedies, soaps, shaving balm and a unique 'eau-de-cologne' based on, of all things, vinegar. Call in advance, and a guided tour can be arranged too. </p> <p> <strong> Silk</strong><br> Antico Setifico Fiorentino<br>Via Bartolini 4. (0039 055 213 861)</p> <p>Just across the Ponte Vecchio, away from all the usual sights, is the peaceful old artisans' neighbourhood of Oltrarno. Down a narrow backstreet, watch out for a minuscule metal sign by an anonymous black metal gate announcing the Antico Setificio Fiorentino, the city's most famous silk-weavers. </p> <p>The moment you step into the verdant courtyard is like going back into the past, as these ateliers and showrooms date back to the eighteenth century, with very little having changed. Noisy wooden looms, hand-operated, produce dazzling, opulent silk and velvet cloth, many in traditional Renaissance designs. Although anyone with the right budget can place an order, their most recent international client was the Kremlin. </p> <p> <strong> Couture</strong><br> Gianfranco Lotti<br> Via Tornabuoni 57. (0039 055 210 226) </p> <p>The Via Tornabuoni could be called the Fashion Avenue of Florence, with beefy security guards, immaculately dressed in black suits, standing to attention outside the likes of Prada, Ferregamo, Trussardi, Versace, Herm\u00e9s, Louis Vuitton, not to mention dozens of priceless jewellers, from Cartier to Bulgari. But hidden amid the globally famous names is a local designer too. Walking into the elegant boutique of Gianfranco Lotti, you come face to face with a perfect reproduction of an ancient Florentine fresco, as if to reassure customers that all the high-fashion leather bags and accessories are actually designed and made in local ateliers. </p> <p> <strong> Fabrics</strong><br> L'Elefante Verde<br> Borgo la Croce 70. (0039 055 234 2882) </p> <p>A couple of minutes' walk behind the Chiesa Santa Croce, well away from the normal shopping circuit, is a jewel of a boutique, the recently opened showroom of local designer Loriana Bergantini. This is only a tiny space but it resembles a treasure chest crammed with exotic fabrics. Signora Bergantini imports beautiful velvet and silk fabrics from Burma, India, China and Japan, then adapts them to her own vividly colourful designs, which range from stylish skirts, jackets and waistcoats, to plush cushions and curtains, bedspreads, bags and scarves. </p> <p> <strong> Paper</strong><br> Giannini Giulio &amp; Figlio<br>Piazza Pitti 37. (0039 055 280 814)</p> <p>While crowds of tourists stream into the Palazzo Pitti, stop off instead in the Aladdin's Cave of master craftsman Giulio Giannini. Since 1856, his family has been operating out of an ancient workshop, right above the boutique, producing hand-made and handprinted paper. Today, there are scores of imitators dotted around the city, but both the quality and inventiveness of Giannini's work sets him apart - hand-sewn leather diaries or sketchbooks, marbled paper books to write down recipes, address and birthday books, even items as simple as a stylish bookmark. </p> <p>Be warned, though, it is impossible to come out of here without buying something. </p> <p> <strong> Eating out</strong></p> <p> <strong> Modern</strong><br> Garga<br> Via del Moro 48. (0039 055 239 8898)</p> <p>Garga is really not like any other dining spot in Florence, and though foodies in-the-know may track it down, its elusive location, hidden away down a dark alleyway, is well off the sightseeing route of most tourists. From the outside it looks like an ordinary trattoria, but walk inside and you enter the rather surrealist world of Giuliano Gargani. </p> <p>Not only is 'Garga' the master chef running the kitchen, but he is an artist too, and has painted the entire restaurant with his psychedelic murals. The cuisine is a modern take on traditional Tuscan dishes, and if you like the food, Garga and his friendly Canadian wife, Sharon, also run a cooking school in a palazzo across the street. </p> <p> <strong> Classic</strong><br> Il Latini<br> Via dei Palchetti 6. (039 055 210 916)</p> <p>Florence is the home of Italian gastronomy, and to sample the the most typical dishes there really is no better place in town than this atmospheric restaurant run by the Latini family. Forget gastronomic pretensions and definitely don't think you're coming here for a quiet, romantic dinner. Queues form the moment the doors open, and although plenty of tourists turn up, you're just as likely to find yourself seated next to local Florentines at one of the noisy, communal, wooden tables. The 80-year-old Narciso Latini slices off hunks of prosciutto crudo behind the bar for those waiting for a table, and don't eat too many of the tantalising appetizers or pasta, as this is the place to try a classic bistecca alla fiorentina , a gigantic T-bone steak. </p> <p> <strong> Chic</strong><br> Cibreo<br> Via del Verrocchio 8. (0039 055 234 1100)</p> <p>Extrovert chef Fabio Picchi runs what many people believe is Florence's finest restaurant, and it is well worth the short trek from the city centre. The restaurant looks out over a lively street market, brimming with fresh Tuscan vegetables. On one side of the street is Cibreo Caffe, perfect for an aperitif, while to enter the restaurant itself, you must pass through the Cibreo Delicatessen, stacked with truffles, olive oil and other irresistible delica cies. There are then two dining rooms, one an unpretentious trattoria, where reservations are not accepted, the other a chic restaurant where smartly dressed waiters effortlessly explain, in any language, the numerous exquisite dishes that arrive, such as passato di pepperoni gialli - a rich soup of yellow peppers - or a delicate ricotta and parmesan souffl\u00e9. </p> <p> <strong> Romantic</strong><br> Osteria del Caffe Italiano<br> Via Isola delle Stinche 11. (0039 055 289 368)</p> <p>Only recently opened, this beautifully restored osteria is a great new find, near the Santa Croce church. Housed on the ground floor of the fourteenth-century Palazzo Salviati, at first it seems you are entering a rather smart wine bar, because at lunchtime, the bar serves mainly Tuscan sausages and cheeses, accompanied by a wide choice of local wines. But past the bar is a refined dining room, just right for a romantic evening meal. The cuisine is excellent, but the real attraction is the incredible wine list - this is the ultimate place to start tasting great Chiantis. They also offer a limited menu for diners arriving late from the theatre or concerts, and there is a selection of solely vegetarian dishes. </p> <p> <strong> Traditional</strong><br> Alla Vecchia Bettola<br> Viale Ariosto 32. (0039 055 224 158)</p> <p>On the other side of the Ponte Vecchio, the Oltrarno is a food lovers' paradise with dozens of simple, reasonably priced restaurants, providing hearty cucina casalinga , home-cooked meals. The best is undoubtedly Alla Vecchia Bettola, away from the traffic-congested main streets, sitting on a quiet tree-lined piazza. Enter this beautifully restored butcher's shop, complete with tiled walls, vast, marble-topped tables and an antique but functioning fogher , an Italian Aga, and it is like discovering Florence a century ago. And the dishes are equally faithful to local customs - topini (mini gnocchi) al pomodoro , huge crunchy crostini Toscani , toasts topped with chicken liver pate, lingua con salsa verde , ox tongue covered with a tart parsley sauce - but make sure you leave enough room for dessert, as the ice creams come direct from the city's finest gelateria , Vivoli. </p> <p><strong> Bars and caf\u00e9s</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Friendly</strong><br> Le Volpe e l'Uva<br> Piazza de'Rossi. (0039 055 239 8132) </p> <p>Thousand of tourists each day stream over the Ponte Vecchio, heading straight for the narrow street that leads to the Palazzo Pitti. But those who know some of the secrets of Florence immediately branch off left after the bridge, into Piazza de'Rossi, a square so tiny it doesn't even feature on most maps. Here is one of Florence's finest and friendliest enotecas, Le Volpe e l'Uva. Tall bar stools surrounding marble tables are always packed outside on the terrace, and the owners, Emilio and Riccardo, will guide you through their ever-changing selection of more than 40 different wines served by the glass. There are delicious bar snacks, too, including a wide choice of Italian cheeses, from the sharp pecorino , a local sheep's cheese, to the delicious Asiago, from the foothills of the Dolomite mountains. </p> <p> <strong> Central </strong> <br> Pork's<br> Piazza del Mercato Centrale. (0039 055 216 184) </p> <p>Florence's bustling morning food market, the Mercato Centrale, is one sight not to be missed, just to witness a real slice of local life as Florentines choose the finest olive oil, freshest mushroom and most delicate hams. Ignore all the tacky stalls selling rip-off leather goods that surround the market - keeping a sharp eye out for pickpockets too - and once inside the mercato , ask any stallholder for directions to Pork's. This is one of several hole-in-the-wall bars where shoppers mix with thirsty butchers, fishmongers and fruit vendors, and everyone tucks into panini bursting with the great Tuscan delicacy, porchetta , crispy roast pork sliced off in big chunks by the genial owner, Franco. </p> <p> <strong> Hip</strong><br> Cabiria, Piazza Santo Spirito 4. (0039 055 215 732)</p> <p>Florence's most fashionable spot for restaurants, caf\u00e9s and late-night bars, is the pretty Piazza Santo Spirito. Here you might see Daniel Day Lewis eating at one of the trendy diners, the Borgo Antico, or wannabe fashion models sitting out on the sunny terrazza of Caffe Ricchi, but the best place to head for, whatever the hour, is the hip bar, Cabiria. </p> <p>Laid-back during the day, the atmosphere heats up and the crowds start to jam the place after dark, when hip hop and house DJs play an eclectic choice of music till three or four in the morning. </p> <p> <strong> After hours</strong><br> Dolce Vita, Piazza del Carmine,5. (0039 055 280 018)</p> <p>Despite a fashionable image and lively student population, Florence is surprisingly quiet after midnight, with few clubs or late-night bars of note. </p> <p>So to catch up with a fun after-hours crowd, head over to the piazza dominated by the baroque Carmine church, where you can't miss the gleaming metal and glass entrance of the Dolce Vita. Although the club's comfortable backrooms, with velvet armchairs and crystal chandeliers, double as a restaurant, the real action at Dolce Vita takes place at the bar and spreads outside on to the terrace. With the DJ starting up around midnight, you'll still find big crowds here in the early hours of the morning.</p>",
  "It would really be jumping the gun, churlish even, to announce that the honeymoon is over. Of course it isn't. It has barely begun! Tomorrow European Union Ministers will begin the process of dismantling the sanctions that have helped to keep Serbia isolated and impoverished. The US and other Western nations will follow suit. Within weeks diplomatic relations will be restored with Belgrade. <p>With joyous small ceremonies there'll be a rush of flag-raising over embassies and, if all goes well, Tito's ghost, which haunts Manhattan's East River, will finally be laid to rest. </p> <p>That ghost is, of course, the old Yugoslavia that died at the hands of Slobodan Milosevic. Thanks to a bizarre series of diplomatic manoeuvrings the old Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, which stretched from the Alpine hills of Slovenia to the dry plains of Macedonia, still exists as a 'member' of the United Nations. The East River and the UN's Palais des Nations in Geneva are the last places on Earth where the old red-starred flag of Tito's country still flies. </p> <p>Not for long. Soon, no doubt, President Kostunica's Yugoslavia will have sorted out its status along with its re-entry into the plethora of international bodies - primarily the financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. </p> <p>Western Ministers should also soon begin signing cheques for the millions of dollars earmarked for a post-Milosevic Serbia under the terms of the Stability Pact, intended to aid and integrate all of the Balkan states. </p> <p>So far so good. But, then a few weeks or months down the line the country will wake with a sore head. The empty coffers, the factories good for nothing but scrap, the small farmers who find it hard to compete in a global market. And, of course, the equally tough questions of Kosovo and responsibility for almost a decade of wars. </p> <p>In the short term Kostunica and his supporters will have to clear out the institutions of all the vestiges of the ancien regime . Because of the curious nature of Yugoslavia's constitutional set-up Milosevic's allies still control the parliament, government and presidency of Serbia. The recent elections were for the Yugoslav parliament and presidency. But as Milosevic and all his friends began to congratulate Kostunica on his victory on Friday, it began to look suspiciously as if many of them intended to try to hang on to their posts. </p> <p>Until Friday it had been assumed that once Milosevic had gone the whole apparatus of state he had created would go with him. Now, the situation is less clear, despite the obvious power vacuum. </p> <p>In principle, President Kostunica should soon be able to lay the ghost of Montenegrin secessionism because most Montenegrins were not anti-Yugoslav as much as anti-Milosevic. But this may be far more difficult than it at first appeared, because Kostunica and his supporters need the votes of the Montenegrin party that used to support Milosevic in the federal parliament if they are to form the next Yugoslav Government. They may succeed but if they do, they will alienate the pro-Western President of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic. </p> <p>As the economists begin to examine the accounts of Serbian industry, they will discover not only the mass of debt but also that, as Serbia is rapidly reintegrated into the rest of Europe, most of it will no longer be able to compete. Ten years ago, for example, there was little to choose between a Yugo car and a Czech Skoda. Now Skodas compete on an equal footing with cars from the world's top manufacturers but the old Zastava factory which makes Yugos produces barely 5,000 a year. Unemployment will rise. Sanctions and isolation have impoverished Serbia but they have also helped protect uncompetitive domestic production. That shield will go. </p> <p> </p> <p>The war criminals issue is one that is bound to dog Kostunica. A lawyer by training, he has denounced the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague as a 'monstrous institution' and regards it as a political court set up to condemn Serbs. The question is whether the West will decide to keep quiet over the issue or continue to demand that Serbia hand over Milosevic. </p> <p>Until Friday it looked as though Milosevic was a hunted man. Then he met Kostunica, congratulated him on his victory and said that he intended to remain as head of the Socialist Party of Serbia and continue in political life. If he does this, with Kostunica's blessing - and if other high-level indictees, including the President of Serbia, Milan Milutinovic, do the same thing - then a frost may descend on relations between Serbia and the West. So far it is too early to say: yesterday morning opposition sources said that they intended to press criminal charges against Milosevic for ordering the police to fire on demonstrators last Thursday. </p> <p>In Belgrade, human rights activists are divided as to what the recent developments mean. Natasa Kandic, director of the Humanitarian Law Centre, says that she believes the international community 'will not stop talking about the issue'. Others are more sceptical, fearing that in their rush to welcome back Serbia to the fold of normal countries the whole question will simply be swept under the carpet. </p> <p>Kosovo is another issue that is bound to help end the Kostunica honeymoon. Kostunica has said that Nato troops are in Kosovo thanks to Milosevic. He has emphasised that Kosovo is part of Serbia and he intends to seek its return. In fact, whatever any Serbian leader says, Kosovo's Albanians will never agree to any association with Belgrade again, and in the short-term attacks on Kosovo Serbs may increase lest anyone think that a new spirit of reconciliation is abroad. </p> <p>Until the early hours of yesterday morning tens of thousands were still literally dancing in the streets of Belgrade. Serbia has changed and is changing. But, over the next few weeks and months we may find that it has changed less than expected. </p> <p> Tim Judah is the author of The Serbs: History, Myth and the Destruction of Yugoslavia </p> <p> <b>Dictators: Where are they now?</b></p> <p><b> Jean-Claude 'Baby Doc' Duvalier</b></p> <p>Former dictator of Haiti, Duvalier fled in 1986, snatching millions of dollars from the Central Bank. Moved to the French Riviera and lived in style with his wife and two children until the money, and the wife, ran out. In 1994, a broke Duvalier downsized to a small bungalow. He went to ground in 1995, but is still believed to be in France. </p> <p><b>Raoul Cedras </b></p> <p>Another Haitian autocrat, C\u00e9dras ruled for three years and was responsible for up to 2,000 deaths. In 1994, in a US-brokered deal, he fled to Panama, where he lives in luxury in a sea-view apartment. When C\u00e9dras left, he was accompanied by his wife and three children. As part of the deal negotiated by Jimmy Carter, the Americans agreed to pay C\u00e9dras $5,000 a month. </p> <p><b>Alfredo Stroessner</b>, known as 'El Generalissimo'. </p> <p>A butcher and torturer, Stroessner ruled Paraguay for 35 years.

He was given refuge by Saudi Arabia and is now a devout Muslim. He lives with his wife in a coastal villa and takes a daily swim.</p>",
  "<p>Vincent Canby, The New York Times's worldly-wise film critic, once wrote of Sidney Poitier that the actor 'does not make movies, he makes milestones'. In the age of Denzel Washington, Wesley Snipes and Chris Rock, Poitier's influence runs the gamut of American cinema. Put simply, the man has few peers. </p> <p>Poitier interviews are a rarity - he has always shrouded his lives, both personal and professional, in secrecy. Now well into the autumn of his life, he takes his place alongside Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr as one of the 20th century's most eloquent voices on race.</p> <p>Poitier's office, replete with several thousand feet of deep pile carpeting, varnished floorboards, books and paintings, is set within the Sierra Towers apartment block. The building nudges the postcode margins of Beverly Hills and Hollywood. His assistant Marlene greets me at the door of the fifth-floor office - closely followed by Poitier. The actor's apartment is next door. 'Good to see you,' he says, offering up a palsy handshake. He holds a patio door open to a balcony and ushers me out on to a wraparound walkway that leads to his home.</p> <p>Poitier's reception room is congested with furniture - antique Italian, French and African collectables. Stools, mini-tables and chairs compete for every inch of available space. The historical gumbo is impossible to steer a path through, and I tiptoe carefully across the floor. Coffee tables heave under the weight of bric-a-brac: beach pebbles, gilded paperweights, pens, markers, trinkets, timepieces, statuettes and trays filled with loose change and ornamental wood carvings. 'Make yourself at home,' says Poitier. 'We'll get started soon.'</p> <p>As he wanders back on to the balcony to have his photograph taken, I saunter around Poitier's apartment. Next door, a TV room - fitted with pastel-green cupboards - is adorned with books and videos: The Illustrated Twentieth Century, The Green Mile, Heat and his own In the Heat of the Night. </p> <p>A sofa cushion proclaims a blank machismo universal to American marketing, 'If You Want Breakfast in Bed, Then Sleep in the Kitchen'. </p> <p>There are dozens of framed photographs - Bill Cosby and Poitier, Mandela and Poitier, Harry Belafonte and Poitier, a promotional photograph for The Blackboard Jungle, pictures of his six children, and Poitier and his second wife, Joanne Shimkus. A mantelpiece stores numerous awards - a 1963 Nato trophy for 'Star of the Year', the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award from 1992, and an Oscar for Best Actor, awarded to him in 1963, for Lilies of the Field. </p> <p>While waiting for The Observer's photographer to assemble his photographic equipment, Poitier slides into an armchair by the balcony walkway. 'Sit you doon,' he says, gesturing towards a dinky, gold-lacquered Italian stool nearby. I perch myself on the edge, and we traffic a quick exchange on photography. 'I sometimes like the pictures photographers take of me,' says Poitier. 'I don't know what they see, though,' he adds, thoughtfully. 'What are they looking to capture?'</p> <p>He looks at me and I lean forward to adjust my T-shirt. Only then am I aware of a sinking gravitational pull, augmented by a thwack as the stool gives way. I find myself splayed on the ground, staring at the ceiling, knees bent before me. Rolling over on to my front, neither manfully nor gracefully, I gawk embarrassedly at the extent of my destruction -a broken stool leg lies nearby.</p> <p>Fumble, fumble. 'Was there something defective with the stool? Surely I couldn't have done that.' I'm genuinely mortified. Poitier shoots me a refrigerated frown, examining the stool's broken leg. 'No. You did that,' he says. I exaggerate my incredulity: 'Er, did I really do that? Are you absolutely sure there was nothing wrong with the stool? I mean, I'm not that big.' </p> <p>Turning the stool over, Poitier grimaces at the splinters of mahogany that once made up the joist. 'Yes, you definitely did that.' His eyes give me the look of finality. 'I can get it fixed. I'll bill the London Observer,' he pronounces. 'A coupla grand should do it.' I smile meekly, find myself a sofa with all the sturdiness of a Humvee Jeep, and collapse into it. </p> <p>The conversation, logically, begins with his soon to be published memoirs. The Measure of a Man, part-memoir, part-spiritual survey, has all the quiet resilience of Poitier himself. The book's 250-odd pages harbour a quasi-intellectual thesis on modern masculinity - the author finds tools of male potency in family, nature and self-evaluation. He writes: 'I felt called to write about certain values, such as integrity and commitment, faith and forgiveness, about the virtues of simplicity, about the differences between \"amusing ourselves to death\" and finding meaningful pleasures - even joy.'</p> <p>'It isn't the kind of book I could have written at the age of 20,' he says. 'Or even 30. I am what I am. This is the journey that I undertook all those years ago. It has been an incredible journey - I remind myself of that every day. I hope it signals something.' The book is a joy to read, warm-natured and scholarly - The Measure of a Man reinforces the argument that Poitier, indeed, has few peers imbued with a similar gravitas. It also, naturally, embellishes an already extraordinary career.</p> <p>Sidney Poitier was born in 1927 in Miami during a mainland visit by his parents. The infant Poitier weighed only 3lb - his dejected father went to look for a shoebox in which to bury the child. He grew up on Cat Island in the Bahamas, a meagre spit of land 46 miles long and three miles wide. His father, Reginald James Poitier was a tomato farmer who raised six other children. 'It was a land unspoiled by capitalism,' says Poitier. 'We lived off the land - wore cloth sacks. It was the pre-industrial age.'</p> <p>In 1936, keen to resuscitate the domestic market, the state of Florida forced an embargo on tomatoes grown in the Bahamas. The following year, Poitier and his mother set off for Nassau. Reggie Poitier would wrestle a meagre living off an agrarian existence for a further 30 years.</p> <p>Nassau in the 30s was a land of grubby opportunism as a slew of migrants from the Bahamas siphoned a path of cheap labour. It was also Poitier's first introduction to race and class. In The Measure of a Man, he recalls an early experience with white supremacy. Aged 13, Poitier, while walking up West Bay Street, noticed ahead an older white teenager cycling towards him on the opposite pavement. Poitier walked on undeterred - even as the boy steered his bicycle towards him. 'He rode up, and as he got abreast of me he took his right hand off the handlebar and punched me in the face. Boom!'</p> <p>Poitier's awakening to a white-dominant culture became a rivulet of his waking angst. 'I went looking for the cyclist,' Poitier tells me. 'That was my instinctive response. I was not afraid. I was not afraid of this guy who rode up and punched me on the mouth. First, I thought it cowardly. And I was angry, and I went chasing after him. I couldn't find him, though.'</p> <p>The family moved to Miama and Poitier, still in his teens, ran off to New York. He had given up school after only a year and a half of formal education. In New York, and Harlem more specifically (a fabled destination for Southern migrants), Poitier's formative years were defined by a succession of odd jobs - dishwasher, cleaner, construction worker and a year in the US army. The work was unsteady and often dangerous. He slept in bus stations and on pavements. </p> <p>Poitier's first foray into acting was accidental from the outset. In 1945, jobless and politically untutored, he stepped into The American Negro Theatre on 127th Street. His audition was a disaster, but acting drew from him a self-expression he could rarely articulate in the outside world. Regular stage work became a guarantee with theatre tours that wandered throughout the country. In his early roles, such as 1950's No Way Out and 1951's Cry, The Beloved Country, Poitier was the antithesis of Paul Robeson, until then Hollywood's only mainstream black actor. While Robeson championed civil rights and socialism - his vocal attacks led to his eventual blacklisting by Hollywood - Poitier's hip dynamism hinted at the all-American strength of freshly hewn maple.</p> <p>But it was his first mainstream picture The Blackboard Jungle, released in 1955 and based on Evan Hunter's ferocious attack on inner city schooling, that iconised Poitier in the popular consciousness - 45 years later, the film stands as a seminal piece of theatrical cinema. And Poitier, as Gregory W Miller, a juvenile delinquent eventually rehabilitated by Glen Ford, broke all the wider stereotypes of the teenage black threat. The film - decried by Congresswoman Clare Booth Luce as 'un-American' - was released in the same year as the Brown vs Board of Education Supreme Court ruling that unanimously voted in integrated education. </p> <p>'Was I amazed that the film was considered subversive? No, not really,' says Poitier. 'Hollywood hadn't made these kinds of films. The social conscious movement that was creeping up elsewhere hadn't ingrained itself in the film industry yet.'</p> <p>Following The Blackboard Jungle, Poitier relocated to Los Angeles with his wife, Juanita Hardy, consolidating his success with roles in 1957's Edge of the City, 1958's The Defiant Ones (Poitier was the first black actor to be nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award), 1961's Raisin' in the Sun and Lilies of the Field, for which he won an Academy Award in 1963. Before Poitier, black mainstream talent had rarely expressed itself in mainstream cinema. African-American filmmakers shot reels on shoddy budgets, parading their home movies in specialist cinemas. Poitier, young, eloquent and characterising an immaculately tailored sexuality, was a post-war poster boy idolised by suburban housewives. </p> <p>'It was a strange time for me,' says Poitier. Why, I ask? He pauses, fidgeting with his hands, then tells me he spent most of his Hollywood years in psychoanalysis. 'I lived in a country where I couldn't live where I wanted to live. I lived in a country where I couldn't go where I wanted to eat. I lived in a country where I couldn't get a job, except for those put aside for people of my colour or caste.'</p> <p>I was surprised to discover that Poitier, ingrained in the cannon of American cinema for roles displaying fortitude, stoicism and quiet storms, should seek the benefits of counselling. He visited Viola Bernard, the 1968 founder of the American Committee on Psychoanalysis, Community and Society, for 11 years. 'I had to think twice or three times about every step I took,' says Poitier. 'I was in a culture that denied me my very existence. And I had no forces behind me. When I walked the streets outside of 'The Neighbourhood' which I was confined to, I had to be constantly on the alert. The America I am speaking of was a different place back then: the dominant culture did not care about my survival as a human being.'</p> <p>The psychoanalysis also allowed Poitier the emotional foundations with which to tackle an impending divorce. 'My father was very big on marriage. And divorce, I believed, was so stigmatic. So stigmatic. I considered it a failing on my part - a flaw in my character.' Still, the strong characterisation of genre breaking parts continued: A Patch of Blue in 1965, and, in the same year, The Bedford Incident. Never completely a Hollywood insider, Poitier soldiered on for most of the decade, introducing the town to fresh talent like Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor.</p> <p>By the summer of 1968, Poitier held the top three spots on the takings list -To Sir, With Love, co-starring Lulu and Judy Geeson; In the Heat of the Night, with Rod Steiger and Lee Grant; and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, with Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. More than 30 years later, In the Heat of the Night, directed by Norman Jewison, is still American cinema's most profound evocation of racial inequality - a dignified portrayal of black and white in shades of grey. As Philadelphian Detective Tibbs, pulled into a murder investigation run by Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) in a small town in the Deep South, the film provided Poitier with his most considered screen persona. And the production is now an academic protectorate - both Poitier and Steiger are regular speakers at American symposiums dedicated to the film.</p> <p>'Up until then, you just didn't get that kind of exchange between black and white actors,' commented Steiger, at a Long Island, New York film seminar in the summer of 1998. 'The races in cinema, much as in real life, didn't mix. In the Heat of the Night wasn't just risky cinema: it was a revolution. Suddenly, police brutality, government crackdowns, the civil rights movement - they were all thrown into the American consciousness. Hell, the South hated the film so much it was banned down there.'</p> <p>But as succinctly as Poitier seemed to embody all the aspirational, majestic grandeur of the post-war African-American migrants to the North, he was ostracised by a force as immovable as racism: the counter culture. Black rage annihilated apple-pie America in 1968; over 200 cities burned following the assassinations of Robert F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The Democratic National Convention in Chicago was blighted by 500 arrests. And on the West Coast, Huey P Newton's Black Panther Party For Self Defense marched across California, delivering food and soup to the impoverished, arming barrios and projects with the rhetoric of revolt. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at the Mexico Olympics, American athletes Tommy Smith and John Carlos shook black fists of defiance on the medallist's rostrum. White teenage America quickly followed suit, and 'the pukes', as Frank Sinatra dubbed the rock'n'roll generation, took to campus grounds in Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles in a war of political attrition.</p> <p>In The Measure of a Man, Poitier writes: 'There was more than a little dissatisfaction rising up against me in certain corners of the black community The issue boiled down to why I wasn't more angry and confrontational. New voices were speaking for African-Americans, and in new ways. Stokely Carmichael, H Rap Brown, the Black Panthers. According to a certain taste that was coming into ascendancy at the time, I was an 'Uncle Tom', even a 'house Negro', for playing roles that were non-threatening to white audiences, for playing the 'noble Negro' who fulfils white liberal fantasies.'</p> <p>Aware of his diminishing cachet as a leading man, Poitier turned to directing. 'I decided I had to reconfigurate, redesign my career.' He piloted four successful features for Universal Studios: 1972's Buck and the Preacher, 1973's A Warm December, 1975's Let's Do It Again and most memorably, the 1974 screwball comedy Uptown Saturday Night, starring Bill Cosby and Harry Belafonte. Privately, however, Poitier occasionally unveiled a deep-set depression and disillusionment with the film industry. </p> <p>'I viewed him as very much part of the establishment,' says Al Young, scriptwriter for the anarchic 1981 Richard Pryor vehicle Bustin' Loose. Young, now 61, was invited to collaborate with Poitier in 1976 on A Piece of the Action - a film sanctioned by a Universal Studio's sub-division, First Artists International. The baby studio was designed to grant creative control to the Hollywood acting elite - Sidney Poitier, Steve McQueen, Barbara Streisand, Paul Newman and later, Dustin Hoffman. Young remembers: 'Sidney wasn't having a good time. There seemed to be some kind of personal crisis. I was young and radical, definitely one of the Berkeley set. It was the age of rebellion and mass demonstrations. Perhaps Poitier thought some of my hip credentials would rub off on him.'</p> <p>The ethics of cultural dissent - intuitive to Young, then 37 - were new to both Poitier and his characters. And Young eventually withdrew from A Piece of the Action before completion. Almost 25 years later, armed with an engine of charming anecdotes, Young chortles loudly: 'I have memories of a kind and warm man. Someone genuinely dedicated to his craft. But someone, nevertheless, deeply troubled by his fame. It seemed like success, in return, had exacted some horrible price. It's like I remember his Oscar - it was permanently displayed on the floor, keeled over.'</p> <p>Young recalls an incident at the Poitier residence in 1976. 'Sidney always made a big thing out of the fact that he never owned a Rolls-Royce nor a Mercedes. It seemed to keep him in touch with the working classes, so instead,' says Young, laughing, 'he had all these Cadillacs. He displayed a natural empathy towards the working class, but in many ways he was the classic poolside socialist.</p> <p>'Anyway, one day his car breaks down, so he calls the repairman. The guy who showed up was black. He took an instant dislike to Sidney - and treated him with contempt. The look of disgust was unbelievable. It was like Poitier embodied all the evils of someone who had sold out the cause. And Poitier took that very badly. It upset him a great deal.'</p> <p>The popular denunciation of Poitier throughout the late 60s and 70s knew no limits. Black nationalist H Rap Brown deplored his 'Uncle Tom' characterisations. Poitier was more famously immortalised in Amiri Baraka's 1978 play, Sidney Poetical Heroical -a cruel satire that ridiculed the actor as a cheap white liberal gambit on race relations. And three years later, The New York Times published an article, entitled 'Why do white folks love Sidney Poitier so?'</p> <p>'I don't wanna get into that,' Poitier tells me, wringing his hands. 'It's all so deep and so complicated.' His stoicism rarely permits him to elucidate on those barbed attacks. In The Measure of a Man, he notes: 'The heated tempers of that time have long since cooled, and ideological fashions have come and gone.' The line indicates a fractional victory, but better illustrates, on the whole, his seclusion from the counter cultural debate.</p> <p>'He just wasn't of those times,' says Young. 'His was an era of polite gentlemanly etiquette. Hollywood was warming to blaxploitation movies like Shaft. I remember going to his house in 1976, and Sidney and his wife left me in the garden. I sat down on the grass and started reading a copy of Rolling Stone magazine - I was a writer for them. Suddenly, the upstairs window opened and there was Sidney. \"Al,\" he exclaimed. \"What are you doing?\" I told him I was sitting on the grass. \"But we never do that!\" he yelled. \"My God! Can I get you a chair?\"'</p> <p>Later in the afternoon, Poitier, un-prompted, revisits his period of wretchedness. His voice is hushed. In fact, his hands better demonstrate his emotions. 'It was a time when rage had matured to an uncontrollable response,' he breathes. 'The black community had made almost no dent in what was a bogus democracy that said it was a democracy. And the people who looked at my career saw two things. They saw what these liberal white filmmakers were doing, and they loved it. Because it was new and it was saying, \"We are unique.\" The revolutionaries, however, had this convoluted attitude, because it was time for revolution, or whatever. They thought I was too good, too well educated, too refined.' Poitier laughs, and shakes his head. 'Hell, partner,' he winks. 'I couldn't fight that. I didn't even try.' </p> <p>Poitier's wife glides into view from a back room. Joanna Shimkus, 57, is a local TV star in Hollywood; the couple married in 1976. 'Why don't you take the young man out for some lunch? Aren't you hungry, dear?' she tells Poitier. Shimkus wanders off back to the kitchen, through the lounge, idly inspecting Poitier's cultural bric-a-brac. </p> <p>'Sidney?' she exclaims. Poitier rises to his feet, 'Yes, darling?' Shimkus holds up a leg from the stool broken earlier. 'We really do have to get something done about these antique chairs. This one keeps breaking.' </p> <p>I throw a determined glare at Poitier, who blankly stares back. 'You're a damn liar!' I yell. 'Do you have any idea how self-conscious that incident made me feel all afternoon?' Poitier throws his head back and laughs. He slaps me on the knees, 'C'mon kid, let's get some food.'</p> <p>Downstairs at the Sierra Towers's reception desk, Poitier kicks back with the receptionist. 'Isn't she sweet?' he says. He points at me, 'You don't wanna get involved with this guy.' The receptionist, tall, black, lithe, her clothes seemingly lacquered on to her skeleton, giggles and flashes her eyebrows. 'Mr Poitier,' she writhes. 'I'll remember to take your advice.' Poitier glides into his black BMW and the car sails towards Beverly Hills. 'Fuck it, let's have a proper lunch,' he murmurs. At traffic lights, pedestrians stop and squint through his open driver's window. Poitier ignores the squeals of recognition. 'You'll love this restaurant,' he says.</p> <p>Poitier steers the BMW into the car park behind Spago, the renowned Beverley Hills eatery, whose kitchen is directed by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. Going past 3pm, we've missed lunch. 'But we might just catch something,' says Poitier. A dim hallway leads us inside, where four waiters sit .around a table, anticipating the evening melee.</p> <p>'Mr Poitier, always good to see you,' cries one. Locally, his name is pronounced 'Poy-tiere'. Another waiter leaps to attention: 'Lunch, Mr Poy-tiere? No problem, let me show you to your favourite table.' We are both hustled into our seats amid a flurry of newly spread tablecovers, fresh napkins and polished crockery. Puck walks by, double-takes, and halts at the table. 'Sidney,' he laughs, fondly. 'Always good to see you. I have a wonderful salad. A dressing to die for.' </p> <p>The lunch is magnificent. Methodically working through a green salad, Poitier says: 'I get offered work these days.' He is currently considering resigning from his post as ambassador to Japan from the Bahamas - he was appointed to the position in 1997. And he last appeared in cinemas in The Jackal, a 1997 remake of the original, starring Bruce Willis. 'But something's always wrong, either the scripts or the directors.' He looks at me: the burden of his 50-year long filmography etched on to his face. He says, 'I have to consider my past, all those other films. Anything after it has to fit in.'</p> <p>We drive back to Sierra Towers and for the first time all day the conversation is conducted by goofy fascinations and trivial interests. Poitier laughs at my accent, and I guffaw at this elderly man's still-intact wonderment of life. 'I think I have an average curiosity,' he admits. He stops the car in front of the apartment block and shakes my hand - there's that firm, diplomatic grip again. 'I guess I'll get that chair fixed now,' he laughs. And Poitier, who signalled in the era of intelligentsia in post-war filmmaking, disappears soundlessly into the building.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,379015,00.html\">Read Philip French's analysis of Poitier's career here</a>.</p> <p>\u0095 The Measure of a Man by Sidney Poitier is published by Simon &amp; Schuster for \u00a316.99.</p>",
  "<p>When the camera is trained on him, he goes immediately, automatically, into that famous and familiar moody, brooding look. You wonder if Sir Alex Ferguson has it right when he talks about the fun-loving boy having become an introverted young man, or whether it is just a professional pose that Manchester United and England's golden vision has picked up from his wife Victoria. </p> <p>After all, a similar attitude to the lens has proved marketable and profitable for her in another branch of showbiz. Either way, David Beckham is yer average snapper's dream, a top photographer's challenge. Because of his good looks and natural relationship with a camera, it is as easy to get a cracking shot out of Beckham as it is for United to get one from a free kick 25 yards out. Because he has been changed by painful experience of these eagle-eyed, green-eyed times - where the price of talent and fame is death threats, an attempt to snatch his son and a stalker - that guarded, sullen, photogenic look is both non-committal mask and a way of telling people he doesn't yet know or trust not to come too close.</p> <p>It could be that which Ferguson has sought to understand and explain. But it is not the essence of Beckham and the challenge is to find the hidden reality. It emerges when you spend some time with the man who is a supposedly shallow media face but a substantial figure on the football field. It is to hear and glimpse the unexpected. </p> <p>To the people who believe life is an intellectual exercise, rather than an emotional journey, Beckham appears to be a dumbbell. For a man whose eloquence and intelligence is best with a ball at his feet, he doesn't do half bad in revealing some unsuspected feelings and thoughts, however. 'Absolutely,' he says when you ask him if he agrees that those who have it all are not allowed to have down days. And he admits to having them, admits to having the potential to 'crack up' over remarks about his wife and son. </p> <p>In private, this is not the man whose public image is supposed to echo Dorothy Parker's comment about the actor who 'ran the gamut of emotions from A to B'. You ask him something routine, for example, about the recent goalless draw in Kiev. 'It's always hard going over to places like that,' he begins to reply and you anticipate him saying something like it being because Eastern European teams are so well-organised, but then he adds 'and you see the poverty over there and then come back to your life.' </p> <p>He pauses and looks pensive for a moment before expanding. 'When we were coming back from training the main streets were pitch black. There was, like, a little lamp on each street corner. It was hard to sign autographs over there because the people were so, sort of, intense, but I did the best I could, signing as many as I could because that, and I'm not sounding big-headed, but that to someone, stopping and signing autographs, means a lot. You look at these people and realise how lucky you are.'</p> <p>The first unexpected aspect to Beckham had come an hour earlier. We were sat, the photographer, one of Beckham's agents and I, at a pavement caf* in the well-heeled Cheshire village that is his northern base. With the stealth that disarms full-backs, he suddenly appeared from nowhere, having noticed us on his way home from training and pulled up his silver BMW, one of the fleet of cars he so loves driving, especially at 2am for 'the freedom of the road'. </p> <p>When introduced, he smiles, offers a hand and fixes you with an eye contact surprisingly prolonged and confident for one said to be so shy. His flat surprises, too. No sign of the stereotypical footballer's World of Leather interior here. The wide halls are lined with favourite framed photos from matches and intimate pictures of the Spice Girls, like Mel C on stage in a Brazil shirt and Mel B plucking the eyebrows of her now estranged husband Jimmy Gulzar. </p> <p>There is also a copy of that tableau painting by Michael Browne, The Art of the Game, autographed by the subjects, which features Eric Cantona in imperial Roman pose with his young team-mates, including Beckham, at his feet and Ferguson at his head. In the kitchen, there look to be at least 100 greetings cards urging Victoria - at home with her parents today recovering from viral meningitis - to get well. Behind a door with a silver star on it inscribed 'Brooklyn's Room,' their son naps under wall paintings of cartoon characters. </p> <p>Beckham himself likes to relax by drawing Disney characters but he wanted someone better for the murals, he says. We settle in the tasteful lounge, in two of the three deep, cream fabric sofas set around a thakat table and the widest of widescreen televisions. It does not dominate the room, though. Nor does a touching photo of Victoria and him in embrace. That falls to a 3ft-high Buddha. Only Brooklyn's toys, which include a mini sit-in sports car, disturb the ambience here, as does a bag of Pampers back down the corridor. </p> <p>You can bet Beckham knows that Feng Shui is not the name of some Japanese full-back he may encounter in the next World Cup finals. It's funny. You think you know everything there is to know about Beckham because he seems to be such public property these days and you wonder what new questions you can ask him. You soon realise how much time you would need to get a full picture. </p> <p>He has a new book out, My World, and it contains some fascinating insights, both verbal and pictorial. It is, it should be said, a quick response to the prospective publication of an unauthorised book which was contested in the courts by Beckham and his wife, by Andrew Morton, formerly the controversial chronicler of Diana, Princess of Wales. In retaliation, Beckham has clearly been advised to launch a charm offensive, of which a television appearance with Michael Parkinson and quite probably this interview are parts.</p> <p>There is more in his book than I thought there would be, I tell him. 'A lot more than I wanted there to be,' Beckham says, and that dilemma between wanting to open up and fearing the consequences surfaces. It courses through his conversation. Yes, Manchester United would beat England, he says instantly, before adding 'No. I don't know. I can't really answer that.' You find out that he has been, he admits, inches and seconds away from thumping an abusive member of a crowd and that he understands 'totally' what Cantona did five years ago when he leapt feet first at a fan. He quickly has to add the politically correct rider that what Eric did was wrong. </p> <p>You find out, too, that he wears a new pair of custom-made boots for almost every game, unlike most professionals who prefer a worn old pair, because he likes to look smart and feel good. That makes around 300 pairs so far around this mid-point of the 25-year-old's career. He keeps all the used-once pairs 'somewhere in London', he says, but is hesitant to tell you where. It takes a while for you to realise why he is so reticent, then you understand; some budding Imelda Marcos out there could well be tempted into a bit of breaking and entering. </p> <p>We start, once he has finished his chip butty with ketchup, by talking about Manchester United. It is, after all, for all the peripheral matters, the blood that courses through the veins of his varied life. With United so dominant in the Premiership in early season, the title is already as good as won, isn't it? </p> <p> 'People always say when we are playing well that we've won it already but I think to us it's never over until the last ball's kicked in the last game of the season. We play till then. If we were to believe what people say about the team and the players, we probably wouldn't be as ambitious as we are.' You wonder if it ever gets boring, winning games so comfortably, and whether this might be behind some uncharacteristic recent squandering of comfortable leads. </p> <p>'It never, ever gets boring,' he says. 'Against Everton, the first half was probably the most enjoyable game of football I've played in, not because we were hammering them, or winning two or three-nil, but just the way we were playing. It was such good football, such enjoyable football, the way we were passing the ball about, the times I was getting on the ball. </p> <p>'Even when I'm not involved in some of the moves, I can look at it and smile because I think how lucky I am to be in a team like this that plays this football. There is a lapse in concentration sometimes for five or 10 minutes and a team gets back into the game but I don't think we're a team that takes the mick out of teams. The respect thing is always there towards other teams because they are professional players playing their best and trying their hardest. We are taught that as we come through the ranks at United. Like we're taught that it's important not just to be playing good football at the start of a game but also at the end of the season.' </p> <p>Never was that better seen than in United's Treble year, when they won the European Cup with the last two kicks of the campaign. Is this team even better? 'I wouldn't say we were better but we are a more experienced team. I think we have learnt from our experiences of playing in Europe and winning the Premier League. We go into Europe and know what to expect from these teams most of the time.' Like the routine goalless draw in Kiev? 'That's the good thing about it.'</p> <p> The 3-1 defeat at PSV Eindhoven intruded as motivation anew. It is remarkable, love them or hate them, that United retain the same thirst for trophies season after season, just when you think they may have peaked. </p> <p>'I don't think I'm at my peak yet and I don't think this team is at its peak yet,' says Beckham. 'Because most of us are still young, still 25 and 26, we've still got a lot to learn from the game. There are still a lot of trophies to be won. We are not getting ahead of ourselves and we're not being big-headed.' </p> <p>Remarkable, too, that United maintain an astonishing appetite for work during games, the factor which distinguishes them from rivals who may have as much talent. 'That's the good thing about our team,' he says. 'You don't get players hiding during a game. Players work hard not just for themselves but for the team. If you look around the team, every player works for each other. If one player goes forward, another will step in. </p> <p>'That was the work ethic we have had pumped into us since we were apprentices. Me, Gary, Phil, Scholesy, Butty, Giggsy, we were brought up to work hard at our game and we knew the rewards in front of us if we did. We had to go back in the afternoons and some of us went back in the evenings to work with the kids who were coming up when we were apprentices.' </p> <p>Now in the afternoons, Beckham will sometimes go back and practise free-kicks with bare feet, to improve his feel for the ball. 'It's something I have always done,' he says, and no, it doesn't bruise or damage his feet. 'I did have bad toenails and a fungal infection in all my toes around the World Cup but I got put on tablets for six months and that cleared it up.' Was it true that the youth team coach Eric Harrison's motto to the apprentices was to play the game and not the occasion? </p> <p>'Yeah. It was the best thing to say to us really. Because when you are at a team like Man United you can step on to the pitch and look around and think, \"Oh my God, what am I doing here?\"' Has he ever felt that? 'Never. Sometimes I look around and think, \"Jesus, I am a lucky person.\"' It echoes what Sir Alex, who often speaks of what makes a Manchester United player, once said of Eric Cantona; that he walked into Old Trafford and stuck out his chest as if to ask if the club was big enough for him. </p> <p>'You have got to have a certain amount of arrogance to play at Man United, whether people like it or not,' adds Beckham. 'It is such a big club with so many expectations of you as a player. If you look through the United teams over the last 10 years, they have had players who have got the arrogance and the determination to win. That's pumped into us even at a young age. We have all got the aggression. It's been proved a number of times. We all stick together and that's the important thing.' </p> <p>The criticism arising from their attitude, you put to him, is that United are ungracious in victory, let alone defeat. 'We are ungracious in the extent of we just hate, despise losing. It's not like we won't shake players' hands. We are not that sort of team. We'll accept it if we've been beaten but we hate it. That's what makes us the players and the team we are. People always sing \"we hate Man United\" but you always get them asking for your autograph afterwards.'</p> <p>The affinity for United, the club given to him by his dad Ted, is deep. Has he never thought of leaving, not even when dropped last season for the match against Leeds after an argument with the manager over him missing training to look after Brooklyn? 'Never,' he replies, quick as a flash. 'There was something in the papers that weekend that this could be it but I never even thought about it. </p> <p>'I was on international duty that week and me and Gary [ Neville, his best friend and best man at his wedding] just talked about what had happened. We decided the best thing I could do was get my head down, get it sorted and get playing again.' There was a suggestion that Neville had told him to cut out the showbiz lifestyle. 'No,' adds Beckham. 'Gary would never say that. I might be pictured at a party or be in the papers but he knows that even though my wife's in the pop life, I am level-headed and concentrating on my football.' </p> <p>You suggest that what he is going through, with all the public scrutiny, resembles George Best in the Sixties, when United didn't understand the phenomenon of stardom. 'I still don't think they do,' he mutters. Beckham is clearly a different personality from Best, however. He cites his favourite night in as a video and Chinese takeaway with Victoria, and night out a meal in a restaurant with her. Perhaps it is even worse these days, with all the media outlets. 'Most of the stuff that goes into the papers is a load of crap,' he says. 'There was a story saying Walkers wanted to bring out Smoky Beckham crisps and I was supposed to be going to court and taking proceedings because I didn't know anything about it. I was asked about a year ago but I didn't think it was right for me. </p> <p>'People believe stories about me spending \u00a31,200 on a pair of jeans and they think, \"He's big' or whatever.' Then he laughs. 'I buy a lot of clothes and I do spend most of my money on clothes but unless I really liked them I wouldn't buy them. And I didn't like them.' The story about the new boots for every game, told to me by an England player, is true. 'I like the look of new boots and I feel good in new boots,' he says, agreeing that he has a need to feel clean and smart all the time. He breaks the routine only if he has done especially well in one pair, or scored a particularly good goal, in which case he will wear them again. </p> <p>'I used to give some of the old ones with \"Becks\" on the tongue away to charity or back to adidas but since I had \"Brooklyn\" on the tongue I don't give none of them away any more. 'We get phoned up about stories every day. Some you just laugh at and others are hurtful, saying things that are so not true. There was a story saying me and Victoria were arguing because she was spending so much time doing her new single. Which is a load of crap. [The story, not the single, you should explain on his behalf.] I don't know whether they are trying to get to us or make people not like us but it's things like that that upset us.'</p> <p>Actually, the two are probably well aware that doting celebrity couples may be interesting to the well-paying glam mags but are less exciting to the mass market red-top papers who know that rifts sell better. Along with controversy. 'People say, \"Oh he's going off the rails, he's down in London, or living in London,\"' adds Beckham. 'I've never lived in London while I've been with Man United. People like to stir things up and make the manager believe things.' So does the legendarily watchful Ferguson phone him to see what he is up to? </p> <p>'He's done it once but I think he rings other people around me. There was one occasion about two months after the Leeds game. It was said I was flying here, there and everywhere, to Italy, to Spain, and he rang me up one afternoon when I was going for a sauna in Manchester. He said, \"Where the eff are you?\" I said, \"In the car.\" He went, \"Oh right. I've just had a call saying someone's sat next to you in Barcelona airport.\" I think he gets calls all the time about me. Some of them he doesn't believe and some of them he's got to check out because they could be true.' </p> <p>It is a, shall we say, interesting relationship with the manager. 'Beyond whatever has gone on between me and the manager or whatever's been in the papers,' he replies, 'I think there will always be that respect from me to him and hopefully him to me.' Is it true that the players privately call him Taggart, after the dour Scottish TV detective? 'I don't. I don't think so. They wouldn't get away with it.' And did Beckham have that shaved haircut to avoid the notorious 'hairdryer' treatment, when Ferguson stands in a player's face to berate him? He smiles. 'I've had it a few times. I had it with Eric Harrison in the youth team.'</p> <p>Beckham no longer keeps it secret that he would prefer to play in the centre of United's midfield, as he did for England last month against France. 'I look at players like Zidane and they are playing in the middle and getting more involved in the game than I am on the right,' he says. 'That's the position I want to play and in years to come hopefully I will. It's just something I want to do and have always wanted to do. But it won't be until the manager gets another right winger, I don't think. He has said in the past that I could if he finds a player who can cross the ball as well as I do. But you never know. He might just get rid of me if he gets another right winger.' </p> <p>Is it therefore possible that he might have to leave Manchester United to fulfil that ambition, to overtake Rivaldo, to whom he finished runner-up last year as World Player of the Year? 'Not really. Even though I want to play in the middle, I am still playing quite good football on the right. At the end of the day, if I am happy in my life and my football at Man United, then I won't make any changes in it. It's up to me and my family, up to me if I am happy football-wise. And I am happy. I've had the offers, you see things in the papers about Barcelona and Milan and Madrid and you think about it, but if I am happy I don't see why I should move anywhere else.' </p> <p>It might be difficult, you suggest, to find such a well-oiled team into which he would slip so easily. 'That's the thing that makes my football enjoyable. I have grown up with these players, we know each other's strengths and weaknesses and we gel. People can always have their opinions, like to become a great player you have got to play in Italy or Spain, but happiness is more important. It's my decision. People will say, \"Oh it's Victoria who's making the decisions.\" It will never be Victoria who will take me away from Manchester United.' And the suggestions that he is under her thumb? 'I'm not even bothered,' he says. 'People can think what they like. I know the truth.' </p> <p>You venture that it's a nice thumb to be under. 'Course it is. It could be a horrible, nasty thumb but it's a very beautiful thumb. People are always going to stir things up between me and Victoria. They say she's the boss but we know the truth.' </p> <p>Might it be the abuse he has endured, notably after the sending-off against Argentina in France '98, that could ultimately drive him away? It seems not. 'I had a lot go on after the World Cup. Victoria was away on tour and I was in the house, the old house in north Manchester, on my own. I used to go driving at two in the morning a lot because I couldn't sleep. I was missing her and I don't need that much sleep anyway [though he also admits, when he does nod off, to being able to sleep through the loudest of alarms]. I like it at that time of the morning and I do like driving. You have just got the freedom of the road. I don't do it so much now because I can sleep now I am a father. </p> <p>'But all that stuff definitely made me stronger as a person. Made me change the way I thought about things and people. A lot of good came out, not that I want it to happen again but looking back, it was good for me in a weird way. I was glad it did. If that hadn't happened, something else would over the next couple of years.' Here, that steely side of his personality appears, as you ask him about certain critics' reaction to the Argentina red card. He repeats the remarks of the new book, which stick out amid all the generally good-natured text, just as his self-destructive periodic spits of temper on the field punctuate his largely creative game. </p> <p>'I'll get them back one day, a lot of people who said things about me on TV and in the papers, a mixture of people,' he says calmly. 'I couldn't name names at this point in time but in my own way maybe I won't get them back but I'll always remember that. I don't hold grudges but if someone has said something nasty about me and my family, then I remember it.' You suggest that putting them in a wall 10 yards away from a free-kick of his might be satisfying. 'That would be nice,' he replies. </p> <p> And the stalker? 'That was six or seven months ago. She just used to come up to the front door. Appear. She got put in care and we've not seen her again, touch wood.' Then you curse yourself for your insensitivity in suggesting that you know you've made it when you've got your own stalker. He smiles a wide smile, as if he's heard that one in the dressing room. 'It's not nice, though,' he says. Then, what about the attempted snatching of Brooklyn outside Harrods last year?</p> <p>'It's something that happened that was a warning for us. We knew from letters we had got and things people had said that he's not going to have the most normal of lives but as parents we are trying to get him to live a normal life. It is going to be difficult to find a school but as long as we are happy with what's going on inside the school then I don't think there will be a problem. You can be paranoid to a certain extent but in the end it'll start affecting your life and we don't want that.' </p> <p>You can imagine he is actually looking forward, as a proud dad, to standing outside the school gates waiting for the bell. It is the comments about Brooklyn from the stands that get to him most. The worst elements seem to have moved on from Posh Spice's imagined sexual preferences to, disgracefully and depressingly, hoping that Beckham's son gets cancer. And he confesses to having been close to emulating Cantona's assault on a fan. </p> <p>'I totally understand it. Things happen on the pitch and things happen off the pitch. What fans shout these days is horrendous, even worse than five years ago with Eric. Eric knows he was wrong but at the end of the day, that's his way.' And when has he been tempted to react similarly? 'Most of the time it's been at Chelsea or West Ham. West Ham are bad. Southampton as well, they're one of the worst. The things they say are the worst I have ever experienced. I have even got used to stuff about Brooklyn now. I've got to. Because if I don't, then I will just crack up. </p> <p>'I just get on with it. I don't like it. It upsets me. It kills me them saying it about either of them. Victoria has always said to me, \"Just think what they are doing. They are getting their aggression out on you and going home to probably a sad life.\" She always turns round and says that if you are ever at that point, just think about what you've got and what you are doing. These people would do anything to be playing for Man United and England. I've got to think of that straightaway or I could do something.' </p> <p>He has, he says, confronted abusers. 'I have turned round sometimes to the crowd when someone's, like, shouting and I can actually hear them saying what they are saying and I look them in the face and they will just stop because they are embarrassed.' Then his sense of humour breaks through. 'Unless it's Chelsea or West Ham. Then I look away again.' </p> <p>He has sensed some change in mood, he says, since Euro 2000, during which he gestured back towards abusive fans after England's defeat by Portugal. He was, after all, one of the country's few successes of the tournament and says of the developing attitude to him: 'It stunned me in a way when I got a player of the year award from the fans [in a recent television poll]. To get that after what people sing and chant about me, that was something that meant a lot to me.'</p> <p>So has he feared playing for England? 'I don't fear it. I don't enjoy it probably as much as I could do but I enjoy it more than I used to. At the end of the day, people shouting at me would like to be out there.' Has he ever thought to himself, I don't need this? 'Never. Jimmy Greaves said in an article that players are paid all this money and not even bothered about playing for England but that's a load of crap.' </p> <p>Then there is a veiled criticism of Glenn Hoddle, once a personal hero who turned into a villain when he dropped Beckham in the World Cup. 'The atmosphere has changed now,' adds Beckham. 'Players always want to play for England but the week leading up to the game has got to be interesting and I think that's changed now. Players enjoy the week more.' </p> <p>What about the criticism of Kevin Keegan, that he may not be up to the job internationally? 'I don't think it can be done any better than it is being done by the staff and the manager. They are doing their best. They can pick the team and organise us but it's up to us to go out there and do the right things and win, which we didn't in Euro 2000. Against France, I felt that the team was so much better the way we played, more like playing for a club team because of the atmosphere between the players and the way they stuck together. </p> <p>'Because I have played so many games now for England I do feel more comfortable than I have ever felt. I love playing for England. I get a buzz stepping out in front of 90,000 fans. Some of them like you, some of them don't. But they all cheer when you score.' And then he laughs at himself. 'Or when I scored,' he adds, referring to the under-performing return of one goal, a brilliant free kick against Colombia, from his first 35 appearances. And for all the abuse, he would clearly like to be captain. You tell him that Keegan has been on the radio, saying that he would consider Beckham as captain if Tony Adams is injured. His face breaks into a broad smile. 'That's cheered me up. Interesting,' he responds.</p> <p>For all the craziness of the past few years, Beckham confesses that he will miss it when it is over. 'Of course. I know I have got things I want to do after I finish playing [skiing is one, though being anonymous enough to take Victoria and Brooklyn and future children camping may be fanciful] but I enjoy football so much it's weird not to think I will be doing it all the time. </p> <p>'I don't want to be a manager or a coach. I'd rather put myself into kids football. I will have had stress and hassle for the last 20 years so it will be a relief not to. I just like to see kids playing football and having a laugh.' He himself still gets that childish feeling of when he was a teenager and he would pass up the opportunity to drink cider on street corners with his mates because he wanted to be in watching Match of the Day then to bed in anticipation of his Sunday morning game. </p> <p>'I hate night games because of the waiting,' he says. 'I love playing in the mornings. Up early, playing early. It's a good feeling. I love playing Saturday-Wednesday, Saturday-Wednesday because at Sunday League level I used to play on a Saturday and Sunday, a Wednesday, a Friday, then Saturday and Sunday again.' </p> <p>As he has gradually opened up, it seems like a good time to ask him about all the jokes, the Becks and Posh, thick and thin, stuff. 'It's a laugh. Them sort of things are funny,' he says. 'It's different when people are slagging you off and being personal.' He hasn't seen the Alistair McGowan impression he says, but laughs politely when you tell him about it. </p> <p>Then it is time for the photographer, time for me to help keep the now-awake, toddling cutie Brooklyn (whose vocabulary seems to consist of 'mamma', 'dada' and 'foo'ball') amused by kicking about his 'Fred the Red' Manchester United ball with him. 'What shall I wear?' Beckham asks his agent. And all of a sudden the look, what the Americans call the 'game face', is back. </p> <p>\u0095 'David Beckham - My World' is published by Hodder and Stoughton at \u00a316.99.

  "<p>Edgar Davids, who thinks there is something funny about footballers who know a lot of football trivia, would have smirked had he seen Jari Litmanen entering a canal-side house in Amsterdam one spring evening last year. </p> <p>Litmanen had come to compete in a football quiz, but first he toured the house exclaiming at its beauty. Perhaps, he said, he would buy one just like it. In seven years at Ajax he had never previously considered moving into Amsterdam, living instead in the unlovely commuter town of Diemen, because all he thought about was football. </p> <p>The apartment that evening was stuffed with Holland's most august football trivia experts. Some of them, at an Amsterdam dinner years before, had shamed Nick Hornby with their grasp of Arsenal history. But in this toughest of contests, the greatest Finnish footballer ever held his own. </p> <p>He would have done even better had he been a less generous man. For when the question designed for him came up 'Who is Finland's most-capped international?' it turned out that the other footballer present, the then Ajax captain Danny Blind, knew the answer too. (Ari Hjelm with 100 caps, as any fule kno.) Litmanen turned to Blind in amazement. 'But,' he stammered, 'it's months since I told you that.' </p> <p>That level of obsession is probably required if you want to become a great Finnish footballer. There are no one-man teams in international football, but as England may discover on Wednesday, Finland are probably the closest thing to it. Christoph Daum, the German coach-elect who watched them beat Albania 2-1 in their first World Cup qualifier last month, wrote afterwards: 'Jari Litmanen is the heart and soul of the team.' </p> <p>To some degree this was predestined 29 years ago, when Litmanen was born the son of two footballers. His mother, Liisa, was a gifted libero, while his father Olavi played for Reipas Lahti, the club founded by Finns expelled from Karelia by the Russians in World War Two. Litmanen's Karelian heritage has made him a Finnish patriot, who always sings the national anthem. 'With gooseflesh,' he adds. </p> <p>As a child he kicked a ball around in the vast family back garden, where he imagined, in the place of the usual snow, the grass of his beloved Anfield. In a school essay he wrote that he would be a team footballer, not an individualist. That he nonetheless acquired the nickname of 'Diego' seems to have been a tribute to his dark hair. </p> <p>He planned his career with the care normally associated with young politicians. In his late teens he set off on a veritable European tour to find the club where he would learn most. Leeds United, managed by Howard Wilkinson, rejected him, as did Bobby Robson's PSV Eindhoven, while Litmanen had never expected to win a contract at Barcelona. However, the club's manager, Johan Cruyff, recommended him to Ajax, and in 1992 Litmanen landed in Amsterdam. </p> <p>Ajax then already possessed a decent No 10 - Dennis Bergkamp. It was as a substitute for him that the Finn made his club debut on August 23, 1992, in the 87th minute of a 3-1 victory over Go Ahead Eagles. For most of that season, however, he sat on the bench studying Bergkamp like a stalker. </p> <p>A year later he replaced him, and by 1995 Litmanen was probably the world's best attacking midfielder. There is an anonymity to his brilliance: Litmanen seldom dribbles or flies in with a tackle or fires home from 30 yards. Typically, he sends a precise ball out to the wing, and then surges stiffly into the box to finish off. Passing and scoring, passing and scoring. He says: 'Zidane is fantastic on the ball, he also defends well, but he scores too seldom. Ver\u00f3n passes with feeling, is an outstanding playmaker, scores too seldom.' </p> <p>Litmanen scored 24 goals in 44 European matches with Ajax, a club record. Of all the players they lost in the Nineties - Davids, Bergkamp, Kluivert, Kanu, the De Boers - the crowd misses the Finn most. Occasionally the Amsterdam Arena still resounds to his special song: 'Oh oh Litmanen, oh oh oh oh.' </p> <p>Last year virtually every self-respecting club in Europe courted him. He chose Barcelona partly because they have a large squad. When it comes to injuries, Litmanen is the Finnish Bryan Robson ('he has the legs of a 35-year-old,' says a friend), and he did not want to join a club like Liverpool where he would have been under pressure to play weekly. But his choice of Barcelona worked rather too well. These days he rarely even makes the subs' bench. Barca now want to sell him - there are many bidders - but Litmanen feels mistreated and insists on staying while pocketing his weekly net salary of \u00a340,000. </p> <p>This may make the above paean to his brilliance sound hyperbolic. However, Litmanen's main problem at Barca is probably that he is a Finn. Being a great Finnish footballer is like being a great Czech car: you never get the respect you deserve. Had Litmanen not been Finnish he would surely have been voted European Footballer of the Year in 1995, when Ajax won the Champions League and World Club Cup. Instead George Weah won and the Finn came third. </p> <p>Notionally, Wednesday's game is a World Cup qualifier. In fact, the closest Litmanen will ever get to a World Cup is his hard-drinking tour of France 98 with a bunch of old ice-hockey friends. Bound for undeserved oblivion, poor old Litmanen will soon be just a quiz question himself.</p>",

  "<p>Until last week Antony Worrall Thompson was solely a man of food. He had nifty ways with Raspberry Fool. He could show you how to knock up a Shepherd's Pie. He believed in shop-bought custard and stock cubes. Then, last Tuesday, he turned up on the platform at the Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth giving William Hague the backing of his substantial celebrity - along with Jim Davidson, Mike Yarwood and Dana. Instantly, Antony Worrall Thompson became a man of politics. </p> <p>Now, as a man of politics, he must have policies. Here he is, then, on fox hunting: 'I think it's awful the way foxes are finally killed but the hunt is still the only way to get the animals out of the ground. So, once they've got them out of the ground, then they should shoot the poor things.'As definitions of caring Conservatism go, they don't get much better than that: keep fox hunting. Just make sure the fox is killed nicely. </p> <p>So how do you get the fox away from the baying hounds? He looks pensive for a moment. 'It's a difficult one, isn't it,' he says. 'You're never going to please everyone, are you?' We are sitting in the carefully tended back garden of his five-acre estate in Oxfordshire, an inherited property made beautiful on the proceeds of his various successful restaurant businesses. Around us a BBC crew are setting up the next shot for the Food and Drink show of which, for the past two series, Worrall Thompson, 49, has been main presenter and which is now recorded here at his home, hard by the Thames. He lights a cigarette - one of many - and points away towards the fields out front of the house where his three dozen chickens are penned. 'Personally I catch the foxes over there and then release them in woods 20 miles away.' But it wouldn't work if everybody did that would it, because people would come and release their foxes by your fields? He agrees. That wouldn't work either. Tricky business, this politics. No matter. He's still keen to be involved. 'I would like to be a politician some day,' he announces. What? An MP? Really? He nods. There has only just been a selection process for a new MP in his local constituency of Henley, currently occupied by Michael Heseltine who is stepping down. The local Conservative Party chose Boris Johnson, editor of the Spectator , to succeed him. 'In five years time I might have gone for it,' Worrall Thompson says, 'But Heseltine resigned too early for me. I'm not ready just yet.' </p> <p>The prospect of Antony Worrall Thompson MP seems at first absurd. He has a cosy, soft, even huggsy persona which is reflected perfectly in the kind of modern comfort food he now cooks on screen; the fishcakes and stews and roasts. He does not seem at all suited to the flinty cut and thrust of political life. Then again perhaps the world of television chefdom has provided him with the ideal training. Last month, during a interview, Delia Smith laid into Worrall Thompson. She called him 'dreadful, just repulsive' and described Food and Drink as 'the most disgusting thing on television'. He hit back, calling her 'the coldest woman on television'. </p> <p>'I also called her the Volvo of cooking which I meant as a term of endearment.' He shrugs. 'I just meant she was safe but obviously she thought I meant she was boring. But she does make lousy scrambled eggs. They're horrible and runny.' </p> <p>And what about Gordon Ramsay, who came to Delia's defence, announcing that he always gives her books to his wife as Christmas presents? 'Ramsay and I have always had a spat,' Worrall Thompson says. 'The sort of food he cooks is outmoded, outdated and not what people want any more. It's destined to sit next to the dinosaurs in the Natural History Museum.' The honourable member for Henley smiles. He may want the fox dispatched humanely but he's clearly more than happy to see Mr Gordon Ramsay ripped limb from metaphorical limb. </p> <p>For all his political ambitions the TV chef is undoubtedly happiest talking about food. Last week Tim Yeo, Shadow Agriculture Minister, announced that he would appoint him as an adviser on organic food if the Conservatives win the next election. Worrall Thompson is definitely up for the job. 'I want to get the message across that food is an important part of people's lives,' he says. 'Nobody's working out what's wrong with our food production. I mean, why in the age of more sprays and pesticides are we suffering from more allergies? Our immune systems are shot to hell and organic food can change that.' </p> <p>He practises what he preaches: as well as the chickens, he keeps pigs, two Middle Whites called Lunch and Dinner, from which he hopes to breed. He uses their manure to fertilise a large organic vegetable garden which supplies both of his London restaurants and a nearby pub that he has recently taken over. At weekends he and his wife Jay run a stall in a farmer's market at Henley selling organic chutneys and eggs. He is, in short, a big believer in the organic food movement. Unfortunately it turns out that he's not such a big believer in the Conservatives' policy on food. 'Tim Yeo said we should push ahead with GM testing in this country. Well, I'm against that. This country is too small. If we get it wrong then we've ruined nature for life and you can't go back.' </p> <p>So why give his support to the Tory party if he doesn't agree with them? 'I want to change them. I believe they can be changed.' OK, then, he doesn't see eye to eye with them on food policy. And, I suggest, while we're at it, he can't really agree with their stance on single mothers, can he? After all, now into his third marriage, he's created a few of those himself. He has two teenage sons living in Australia by one former wife, whom he supports, and another child by a previous relationship whom he does not see. (He now has two more children by Jay, Toby-Jack, five and Billie-Lara, three.) 'No,' he says, 'I don't agree with that. But then I'm not going to agree with any government on every policy, am I?' </p> <p>What about Ann Widdecombe's stance on cannabis? Have you, Mr Worrall Thompson, ever been stoned? 'No.' What, you've never smoked dope? 'Oh yeah, I've smoked dope. It just made my legs go to sleep. All right, no, I didn't agree with Widdecombe on that. Yes, we must get tough on law and order. We all want that but the police haven't got time to go chasing after every cannabis user.' </p> <p>We move on. Asylum seekers? 'The majority of the people in this country don't want us to be a dumping ground for every foreign national,' he says. 'Yes, they want the deserving ones to get in but not every chancer.' Ah, progress. That sounds like the voice of Toryism. 'But I don't agree with the idea of penning them all up in compounds.' Oh dear. And we were so close to what political pundits call consensus. </p> <p>On taxation Worrall Thompson has a whole raft of policies. He would like to see VAT raised to 21 per cent and direct taxation lowered. But at the same time he thinks that a 50 per cent tax rate on high earnings of \u00a3150,000-\u00a3200,000 might not be the worst idea in the world. These are both interesting policies in themselves, innovative policies perhaps. They just don't happen to be Conservative Party policies at the moment. Finally we find something he does agree with the Tories on: the retention of Clause 28. 'I'm an open-minded person but most of the country do not want homosexual education stuffed down their kids' throats.' He thinks William Hague is 'a great orator - he knocks spots off Blair. But I do sometimes wonder if Hague is the right leader. He does have to create an image outside the chamber. He's a brilliant politician but maybe he's not number one.' </p> <p>Still, for the moment, Hague's the man. 'More Tories have to come out of the closet,' he says. 'I reckon there are a lot out there but I think they're frightened to admit it. You've got to be brave to be in the Tory party right now.' Perhaps you have to be particularly brave if you are in the restaurant business. It is driven almost entirely by fashion and Worrall Thompson knows that. He made his name in the Eighties with a restaurant called M\u00e9nage \u00e0 Trois, which served only starters and puddings and caught the mood of diners who wanted to go to restaurants to see and be seen rather than to eat. (It was a favourite of Princess Diana.) In the late Eighties he moved on to restaurants like dell'Ugo, serving up an early form of fusion cooking. Now, with his London restaurant Woz, which does one set menu a day, served family style in the middle of the table, he has simplified everything just when it was becoming hip to do so. </p> <p>Is he concerned that some punters might not want to eat in his restaurants because of his unfashionable politics? He drags deeply on another unfashionable cigarette. 'I'll lose the 10 per cent who are radical, maybe, but that's not much is it?' </p> <p>Anyway, he says, he has never pursued trends. 'I'm the one who sets the fashions that others follow.' Perhaps he's right. If so, expect the Conservatives to come up with new policies on GM foods, fox hunting, asylum seekers, single mothers, taxation and drugs any day soon.</p>",
  "<p>On Thursday 14 September a man at one of Esso's service stations in Edinburgh climbed up to the forecourt price display to increase the price of petrol. </p> <p>It was the height of the fuel crisis, and the petrol pumps were running dry in the face of the refinery blockade by militant farmer and haulier protesters. </p> <p>Esso's action immediately caused amazement and fury, not just among motorists, but with officials and Ministers co-ordinating civil contingency plans from a bunker under the Cabinet Office just around the corner from Downing Street. </p> <p>The immediate opprobrium sparked what could turn out to be longer-term problems for oil companies. MPs, unions and motoring groups demanded they be punished for this blatant breach of goodwill. Big oil, after all, was benefiting upstream from swollen revenues generated by crude at more than $30 a barrel at the same time as taking advantage of a national emergency downstream. </p> <p>'There was talk that week and since of a windfall tax on oil companies,' said a Whitehall source. Its practicability was 'being considered'. </p> <p>Such a tax now looks less likely, and the Government would be unlikely to make any move until after an election. </p> <p>But the Chancellor's options do not end there. As Gordon Brown readies his pre-Budget report, the discontented argue that the companies' cavalier attitude last month offers an opportunity to move from a narrow focus on fuel duty to a wider review of the taxation of North Sea oil revenues. </p> <p>The Government considered North Sea taxation in 1998, and left it untouched after the companies warned they could scale down investment. But that was when oil was at $10 a barrel. </p> <p>Recent political and economic pressures may force a re-evaluation. </p> <p>In his party conference speech, Tony Blair said: 'Of the 14p rise [in petrol prices] since the Budget last year, 12p has been in the world oil price.' </p> <p>Last week it emerged that rates of return in the North Sea were 33.1 per cent in the second quarter of this year, compared with 6 per cent among UK manufacturers. Analysts indicated oil shareholders were in line for billions in dividends and buybacks. </p> <p>The core protesters resist widening the issue. 'Bringing in the world price is a government public relations trick to distract from its avaricious tax policy,' says Geoff Dossetter, head of external affairs at the Freight Transport Association. They prefer to focus on one simple demand: a 15p cut in fuel excise duty from its current 48p a litre. </p> <p>But the RAC, which last week asked Brown to freeze the duty, also says the companies should shield consumers from swings in the global oil price. It proposes that duty should be reduced progressively to help motorists as the oil price rises within a band between $20 and $30 a barrel. And as that price rises above, say $25, the lost duty should be made up by taxation of the firms' North Sea revenues. </p> <p>'This way the motorist is given a degree of protection, but the burden is spread between the taxpayer and the oil company,' says the RAC's Edmund King. </p> <p>Both these ideas, however, go against the grain of two fundamental planks of government policy. The first is the environmental reason for the duty - its role in preventing carbon emissions. Moreover, if taxes on producers offset duty lost from consumers, corporate profits subsidise consumption, while the Government is unpopular with oil firms. </p> <p>Second, UK oil and fuel taxation policy involves a global oil industry, where capital seeks its highest return from Indonesia to the Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>Recent history proves the point. One oil analyst says: 'BP played a very hardnosed game over, for example, the Clair field in the North Sea in tax negotiations in 1998.' Prices then were $10 a barrel. </p> <p>Investment confidence since that $10 nadir - which saw nearly 100,000 jobs lost in the North Sea - is slowly reviving. Now BP and other North Sea operators and investors are drawing up future development plans. BP itself has North Sea capital expenditure up from $800 million this year to $1.2 billion next. But companies say they need prices of between $14 to $18 a barrel in the North Sea to make a return. With prices likely to fall, any rise in oil taxes will have to be finely judged. </p> <p>The Government wants high North Sea revenues, which dropped from \u00a33.3bn in 1997-98 to \u00a32.5bn in 1998-99 as the world price of crude fell. These are expected to rebound. </p> <p>It could gain more for taxpayers by increasing the rate or scope of petroleum revenue tax , new field licences or linking tax to rates of return, as in Australia. The problem, however, is that although returns are high at the moment, the North Sea is relatively mature. The reserves left would cost more to exploit. </p> <p>Oil consultancy Wood Mackenzie points to future development and operating costs in the North Sea of $10 a barrel, compared with $5 in Angola and $6 in the Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>Tax is levied on the revenues companies make minus these costs. For the fields developed before 1982, where royalties and petroleum revenue tax are paid, the rate is 69 per cent. For those developed between then and 1993 it is 65 per cent, and for post-1993 fields the figure is 30 per cent. At current prices this taxable revenue is about $20 a barrel but if, as analysts predict, the price falls to around $21, company margins will fall and the Government's North Sea revenue will drop too. </p> <p>If UK rates are increased, oil companies are already saying life would look better for them elsewhere. Companies say costs are the key, although tax rates in other areas vary. In the Mexican Gulf they are between 35 and 43 per cent for deep water fields; and in Angola between 70 and 75 per cent. </p> <p>But the energy consultant and government adviser, Dieter Helm, says simply that the North Sea is British territory, and Ministers' duty is to maximise licence revenues for taxpayers. </p> <p>Some resources should be preserved for future generations, he adds, and low taxes create incentives for rapacious oil use today. If petrol is too cheap, there is no incentive to find other fuels. </p> <p>Helm believes a thorough overhaul of energy taxation is required. His radicalism is unlikely to be shared in Whitehall. The Government, like the markets, believes the oil price is likely to fall next year, weakening the case for wholesale action. A modest package, including duty cuts for hauliers, is more likely. </p> <p>Last Friday some oil companies cut petrol prices. But the oil majors and independent petrol retailers still claim they are losing money at the pumps, so future prices are unclear. If they rise again, the consequences for the companies' tax bills are anybody's guess.</p>",
  "The Conservatives have always claimed to stand for choice. On the stage in Bournemouth, they presented the country with a choice of two mutually incompatible philosophies and three different leaders. <p>First up for your delectation is Michael Portillo, the one-time inflamer of his party's basest prejudices who is now reinvented as the pastel-toned advocate of soft-tissue Toryism. Of all the Conservative politicians of his generation, Mr Portillo is the most intriguing - and I mean that in both senses of the word. He is a man on a personal and ideological journey whose ultimate direction I struggle to predict because he himself is so palpably uncertain about his final destination. </p> <p>His was the most remarkable speech I have ever heard at a party conference. That is because it was not really a speech at all. Declining the use of the bully pulpit from which he once raved, and instead floating around the platform as if it were a TV studio, Portillo offered the political equivalent of Oprah Winfrey. Except that for the better part of an hour the host talked only about himself. Portillo used the conference as his personal confessional. It was not 'I feel your pain'; it was 'Please stroke my feelings'. </p> <p>He hinted at the period of depression that followed his ejection from Parliament, talked about his asylum-seeker father and, coming out to the conference as half-Spanish, gave his surname its native pronunciation. Some years ago, Portillo confided to a close friend that he would never become Conservative leader because of his surname. I have always suspected that it was a desperate desire to over-compensate for a parentage viewed with suspicion by the Little Englanders of his party that led him into the crashing error of his notorious Who Dares Wins rant about the SAS. The new Portillo has adopted as his motto: Who Hugs Wins. Did he really mean to say that he wants his party to embrace people of 'whatever sexual orientation'? Transvestite Tories, that I can imagine. Cottaging Conservatives, we read about them in the newspapers occasionally. But surely Tories for Bestiality is a bit too bracing even for the most libertarian in their ranks. </p> <p>Still, let us give Senor Porteeyo credit where he is due. It was courageous, in the context of a Tory conference, to talk about a Conservative Party that welcomed people of all creeds, colours and sexual preferences, not least because Miguel knows that many Tory activists, if not the majority, are sexual bigots, religious intolerants and xenophobic when not overtly racist. </p> <p>This is a party that has selected only a tiny number of women to fight winnable parliamentary seats. I met one able woman - certainly as talented as the bulk of Tory MPs - who has been turned down by no less than 15 constituency associations in her fruitless search to be adopted as a Conservative candidate. A party that treats white, middle-class, middle-aged women as an ethnic minority is a long, long way from becoming the inclusive party imagined by the Shadow Chancellor. </p> <p>The mass of the Tories at Bournemouth instinctively warmed much more to the thin-lipped talibanism of Ann Widdecombe, barking that she does not know 'what is meant by that phrase social tolerance'. Just as narcissistic in her own way, Miss Zero Tolerance has enjoyed a very indulgent press for the past two years. The canonisation of the Virgin Ann has been the source of great disgruntlement among other Tory frontbenchers who have long been muttering that she is not a team player and has an erratic grasp of detail. Float before them the notion that she might become their leader and most Tory MPs will make the sign of the cross. As one put it to me: 'That's New Labour's third term guaranteed.' </p> <p>All that press flattery has finally intoxicated the Shadow Home Secretary. She made the mistake of inhaling her own propaganda. The result was a fatuous 'crackdown' on cannabis users which was immediately ridiculed by the police and, if it were ever implemented, would result in the criminalisation of half the children of Conservative MPs. Great was the satisfaction among many other members of the Shadow Cabinet when Miss Widdecombe went up in puff of dope. Yet, from the respective reactions to them at Bournemouth, it seemed pretty evident that Tory activists, who will make the choice of leader in a post-election contest, would prefer the black Widders over the pink Portillo. </p> <p>Attempting to straddle the two of them is William Hague. Between the socially liberal approach articulated by Portillo and the moral authoritarianism of Widdecombe, the pro tem Tory leader swings both ways. Hague has belatedly adopted the rhetoric of inclusivity, claiming that the Conservatives are 'a party for all the people', while the genuine representatives of the lost cause of 'One Nation' Conservatism, such as Michael Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke, moan in distress from the margins. Slapping the 'One Nation' label on the most right-wing posture that the Conservatives have adopted in more than 50 years is like trying to sell meths as a bedtime milk drink. Unfortunately for the Conservatives, the voters are likely to give it a precautionary sniff before they put this stuff to their lips. </p> <p>There was a resounding bogusness to William Hague's conference anti-climax. The more he talked about being ready for government, the more I heard the sound of a three-year-old pleading with his parents to let him try to ride his bike without stabilisers. The more he tried to present himself as a down-home boy from Yorkshire, the less authentic he appeared. The most discordant sound came from his most favoured rhetorical rift: 'I'm in it for you.' No, he's not. He's in it for him. </p> <p>I am not saying that Mr Hague is without beliefs and principles. Nor do I doubt that he feels that he could serve his country well. But the idea that his ambition flows from nothing but a desire to represent 'ordinary' Britons against a 'metropolitan \u00e9lite' is a transparent fake. This is a product of management consultancy out of the presidency of the Oxford Union who got into Parliament at an unnaturally young age. A man who has been climbing the greasy pole all his adult life, William Hague is no hick from the sticks, but the political apparatchik incarnate. </p> <p>So, though they may have varied in style and performance, there was a phoney flavour to all three of the leadership speeches we were offered in Bournemouth. And another thing shared by the trio was an utter vacuity where policy should be. This is the hole in the heart of the Conservative claim to be prepared for government. No Chancellor-aspirant has ever offered a script so stunningly devoid of substance as Michael Portillo. </p> <p>There was not a sentence about macro-economics so pre-occupied was he with macro-me. The emptiness within the bellowing vessel of Ann Widdecombe was exposed by the implosion of her dopey initiative less than 24 hours after it was launched. </p> <p>As for William Hague, he sent his party away from what was almost certainly its last conference before the election no closer to explaining how they can possibly reconcile their pledges to cut tax with their spending commitments, promises that continued to accumulate by the billion every day that the Tories spent by the seaside. </p> <p>There you have it. The moist pout of Portillo. The whiplash of Widdecombe. Or the hollow homilies of Hague. What an embarrassment of choice. </p> <p>Servants of the People: the Inside Story of New Labour by Andrew Rawnsley (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a317.99) is now on sale</p>",
  "<p>Vincent Canby, The New York Times's worldly-wise film critic, once wrote of Sidney Poitier that the actor 'does not make movies, he makes milestones'. In the age of Denzel Washington, Wesley Snipes and Chris Rock, Poitier's influence runs the gamut of American cinema. Put simply, the man has few peers. </p> <p>Poitier interviews are a rarity - he has always shrouded his lives, both personal and professional, in secrecy. Now well into the autumn of his life, he takes his place alongside Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr as one of the 20th century's most eloquent voices on race.</p> <p>Poitier's office, replete with several thousand feet of deep pile carpeting, varnished floorboards, books and paintings, is set within the Sierra Towers apartment block. The building nudges the postcode margins of Beverly Hills and Hollywood. His assistant Marlene greets me at the door of the fifth-floor office - closely followed by Poitier. The actor's apartment is next door. 'Good to see you,' he says, offering up a palsy handshake. He holds a patio door open to a balcony and ushers me out on to a wraparound walkway that leads to his home.</p> <p>Poitier's reception room is congested with furniture - antique Italian, French and African collectables. Stools, mini-tables and chairs compete for every inch of available space. The historical gumbo is impossible to steer a path through, and I tiptoe carefully across the floor. Coffee tables heave under the weight of bric-a-brac: beach pebbles, gilded paperweights, pens, markers, trinkets, timepieces, statuettes and trays filled with loose change and ornamental wood carvings. 'Make yourself at home,' says Poitier. 'We'll get started soon.'</p> <p>As he wanders back on to the balcony to have his photograph taken, I saunter around Poitier's apartment. Next door, a TV room - fitted with pastel-green cupboards - is adorned with books and videos: The Illustrated Twentieth Century, The Green Mile, Heat and his own In the Heat of the Night. </p> <p>A sofa cushion proclaims a blank machismo universal to American marketing, 'If You Want Breakfast in Bed, Then Sleep in the Kitchen'. </p> <p>There are dozens of framed photographs - Bill Cosby and Poitier, Mandela and Poitier, Harry Belafonte and Poitier, a promotional photograph for The Blackboard Jungle, pictures of his six children, and Poitier and his second wife, Joanne Shimkus. A mantelpiece stores numerous awards - a 1963 Nato trophy for 'Star of the Year', the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award from 1992, and an Oscar for Best Actor, awarded to him in 1963, for Lilies of the Field. </p> <p>While waiting for The Observer's photographer to assemble his photographic equipment, Poitier slides into an armchair by the balcony walkway. 'Sit you doon,' he says, gesturing towards a dinky, gold-lacquered Italian stool nearby. I perch myself on the edge, and we traffic a quick exchange on photography. 'I sometimes like the pictures photographers take of me,' says Poitier. 'I don't know what they see, though,' he adds, thoughtfully. 'What are they looking to capture?'</p> <p>He looks at me and I lean forward to adjust my T-shirt. Only then am I aware of a sinking gravitational pull, augmented by a thwack as the stool gives way. I find myself splayed on the ground, staring at the ceiling, knees bent before me. Rolling over on to my front, neither manfully nor gracefully, I gawk embarrassedly at the extent of my destruction -a broken stool leg lies nearby.</p> <p>Fumble, fumble. 'Was there something defective with the stool? Surely I couldn't have done that.' I'm genuinely mortified. Poitier shoots me a refrigerated frown, examining the stool's broken leg. 'No. You did that,' he says. I exaggerate my incredulity: 'Er, did I really do that? Are you absolutely sure there was nothing wrong with the stool? I mean, I'm not that big.' </p> <p>Turning the stool over, Poitier grimaces at the splinters of mahogany that once made up the joist. 'Yes, you definitely did that.' His eyes give me the look of finality. 'I can get it fixed. I'll bill the London Observer,' he pronounces. 'A coupla grand should do it.' I smile meekly, find myself a sofa with all the sturdiness of a Humvee Jeep, and collapse into it. </p> <p>The conversation, logically, begins with his soon to be published memoirs. The Measure of a Man, part-memoir, part-spiritual survey, has all the quiet resilience of Poitier himself. The book's 250-odd pages harbour a quasi-intellectual thesis on modern masculinity - the author finds tools of male potency in family, nature and self-evaluation. He writes: 'I felt called to write about certain values, such as integrity and commitment, faith and forgiveness, about the virtues of simplicity, about the differences between \"amusing ourselves to death\" and finding meaningful pleasures - even joy.'</p> <p>'It isn't the kind of book I could have written at the age of 20,' he says. 'Or even 30. I am what I am. This is the journey that I undertook all those years ago. It has been an incredible journey - I remind myself of that every day. I hope it signals something.' The book is a joy to read, warm-natured and scholarly - The Measure of a Man reinforces the argument that Poitier, indeed, has few peers imbued with a similar gravitas. It also, naturally, embellishes an already extraordinary career.</p> <p>Sidney Poitier was born in 1927 in Miami during a mainland visit by his parents. The infant Poitier weighed only 3lb - his dejected father went to look for a shoebox in which to bury the child. He grew up on Cat Island in the Bahamas, a meagre spit of land 46 miles long and three miles wide. His father, Reginald James Poitier was a tomato farmer who raised six other children. 'It was a land unspoiled by capitalism,' says Poitier. 'We lived off the land - wore cloth sacks. It was the pre-industrial age.'</p> <p>In 1936, keen to resuscitate the domestic market, the state of Florida forced an embargo on tomatoes grown in the Bahamas. The following year, Poitier and his mother set off for Nassau. Reggie Poitier would wrestle a meagre living off an agrarian existence for a further 30 years.</p> <p>Nassau in the 30s was a land of grubby opportunism as a slew of migrants from the Bahamas siphoned a path of cheap labour. It was also Poitier's first introduction to race and class. In The Measure of a Man, he recalls an early experience with white supremacy. Aged 13, Poitier, while walking up West Bay Street, noticed ahead an older white teenager cycling towards him on the opposite pavement. Poitier walked on undeterred - even as the boy steered his bicycle towards him. 'He rode up, and as he got abreast of me he took his right hand off the handlebar and punched me in the face. Boom!'</p> <p>Poitier's awakening to a white-dominant culture became a rivulet of his waking angst. 'I went looking for the cyclist,' Poitier tells me. 'That was my instinctive response. I was not afraid. I was not afraid of this guy who rode up and punched me on the mouth. First, I thought it cowardly. And I was angry, and I went chasing after him. I couldn't find him, though.'</p> <p>The family moved to Miama and Poitier, still in his teens, ran off to New York. He had given up school after only a year and a half of formal education. In New York, and Harlem more specifically (a fabled destination for Southern migrants), Poitier's formative years were defined by a succession of odd jobs - dishwasher, cleaner, construction worker and a year in the US army. The work was unsteady and often dangerous. He slept in bus stations and on pavements. </p> <p>Poitier's first foray into acting was accidental from the outset. In 1945, jobless and politically untutored, he stepped into The American Negro Theatre on 127th Street. His audition was a disaster, but acting drew from him a self-expression he could rarely articulate in the outside world. Regular stage work became a guarantee with theatre tours that wandered throughout the country. In his early roles, such as 1950's No Way Out and 1951's Cry, The Beloved Country, Poitier was the antithesis of Paul Robeson, until then Hollywood's only mainstream black actor. While Robeson championed civil rights and socialism - his vocal attacks led to his eventual blacklisting by Hollywood - Poitier's hip dynamism hinted at the all-American strength of freshly hewn maple.</p> <p>But it was his first mainstream picture The Blackboard Jungle, released in 1955 and based on Evan Hunter's ferocious attack on inner city schooling, that iconised Poitier in the popular consciousness - 45 years later, the film stands as a seminal piece of theatrical cinema. And Poitier, as Gregory W Miller, a juvenile delinquent eventually rehabilitated by Glen Ford, broke all the wider stereotypes of the teenage black threat. The film - decried by Congresswoman Clare Booth Luce as 'un-American' - was released in the same year as the Brown vs Board of Education Supreme Court ruling that unanimously voted in integrated education. </p> <p>'Was I amazed that the film was considered subversive? No, not really,' says Poitier. 'Hollywood hadn't made these kinds of films. The social conscious movement that was creeping up elsewhere hadn't ingrained itself in the film industry yet.'</p> <p>Following The Blackboard Jungle, Poitier relocated to Los Angeles with his wife, Juanita Hardy, consolidating his success with roles in 1957's Edge of the City, 1958's The Defiant Ones (Poitier was the first black actor to be nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award), 1961's Raisin' in the Sun and Lilies of the Field, for which he won an Academy Award in 1963. Before Poitier, black mainstream talent had rarely expressed itself in mainstream cinema. African-American filmmakers shot reels on shoddy budgets, parading their home movies in specialist cinemas. Poitier, young, eloquent and characterising an immaculately tailored sexuality, was a post-war poster boy idolised by suburban housewives. </p> <p>'It was a strange time for me,' says Poitier. Why, I ask? He pauses, fidgeting with his hands, then tells me he spent most of his Hollywood years in psychoanalysis. 'I lived in a country where I couldn't live where I wanted to live. I lived in a country where I couldn't go where I wanted to eat. I lived in a country where I couldn't get a job, except for those put aside for people of my colour or caste.'</p> <p>I was surprised to discover that Poitier, ingrained in the cannon of American cinema for roles displaying fortitude, stoicism and quiet storms, should seek the benefits of counselling. He visited Viola Bernard, the 1968 founder of the American Committee on Psychoanalysis, Community and Society, for 11 years. 'I had to think twice or three times about every step I took,' says Poitier. 'I was in a culture that denied me my very existence. And I had no forces behind me. When I walked the streets outside of 'The Neighbourhood' which I was confined to, I had to be constantly on the alert. The America I am speaking of was a different place back then: the dominant culture did not care about my survival as a human being.'</p> <p>The psychoanalysis also allowed Poitier the emotional foundations with which to tackle an impending divorce. 'My father was very big on marriage. And divorce, I believed, was so stigmatic. So stigmatic. I considered it a failing on my part - a flaw in my character.' Still, the strong characterisation of genre breaking parts continued: A Patch of Blue in 1965, and, in the same year, The Bedford Incident. Never completely a Hollywood insider, Poitier soldiered on for most of the decade, introducing the town to fresh talent like Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor.</p> <p>By the summer of 1968, Poitier held the top three spots on the takings list -To Sir, With Love, co-starring Lulu and Judy Geeson; In the Heat of the Night, with Rod Steiger and Lee Grant; and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, with Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. More than 30 years later, In the Heat of the Night, directed by Norman Jewison, is still American cinema's most profound evocation of racial inequality - a dignified portrayal of black and white in shades of grey. As Philadelphian Detective Tibbs, pulled into a murder investigation run by Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) in a small town in the Deep South, the film provided Poitier with his most considered screen persona. And the production is now an academic protectorate - both Poitier and Steiger are regular speakers at American symposiums dedicated to the film.</p> <p>'Up until then, you just didn't get that kind of exchange between black and white actors,' commented Steiger, at a Long Island, New York film seminar in the summer of 1998. 'The races in cinema, much as in real life, didn't mix. In the Heat of the Night wasn't just risky cinema: it was a revolution. Suddenly, police brutality, government crackdowns, the civil rights movement - they were all thrown into the American consciousness. Hell, the South hated the film so much it was banned down there.'</p> <p>But as succinctly as Poitier seemed to embody all the aspirational, majestic grandeur of the post-war African-American migrants to the North, he was ostracised by a force as immovable as racism: the counter culture. Black rage annihilated apple-pie America in 1968; over 200 cities burned following the assassinations of Robert F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The Democratic National Convention in Chicago was blighted by 500 arrests. And on the West Coast, Huey P Newton's Black Panther Party For Self Defense marched across California, delivering food and soup to the impoverished, arming barrios and projects with the rhetoric of revolt. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at the Mexico Olympics, American athletes Tommy Smith and John Carlos shook black fists of defiance on the medallist's rostrum. White teenage America quickly followed suit, and 'the pukes', as Frank Sinatra dubbed the rock'n'roll generation, took to campus grounds in Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles in a war of political attrition.</p> <p>In The Measure of a Man, Poitier writes: 'There was more than a little dissatisfaction rising up against me in certain corners of the black community The issue boiled down to why I wasn't more angry and confrontational. New voices were speaking for African-Americans, and in new ways. Stokely Carmichael, H Rap Brown, the Black Panthers. According to a certain taste that was coming into ascendancy at the time, I was an 'Uncle Tom', even a 'house Negro', for playing roles that were non-threatening to white audiences, for playing the 'noble Negro' who fulfils white liberal fantasies.'</p> <p>Aware of his diminishing cachet as a leading man, Poitier turned to directing. 'I decided I had to reconfigurate, redesign my career.' He piloted four successful features for Universal Studios: 1972's Buck and the Preacher, 1973's A Warm December, 1975's Let's Do It Again and most memorably, the 1974 screwball comedy Uptown Saturday Night, starring Bill Cosby and Harry Belafonte. Privately, however, Poitier occasionally unveiled a deep-set depression and disillusionment with the film industry. </p> <p>'I viewed him as very much part of the establishment,' says Al Young, scriptwriter for the anarchic 1981 Richard Pryor vehicle Bustin' Loose. Young, now 61, was invited to collaborate with Poitier in 1976 on A Piece of the Action - a film sanctioned by a Universal Studio's sub-division, First Artists International. The baby studio was designed to grant creative control to the Hollywood acting elite - Sidney Poitier, Steve McQueen, Barbara Streisand, Paul Newman and later, Dustin Hoffman. Young remembers: 'Sidney wasn't having a good time. There seemed to be some kind of personal crisis. I was young and radical, definitely one of the Berkeley set. It was the age of rebellion and mass demonstrations. Perhaps Poitier thought some of my hip credentials would rub off on him.'</p> <p>The ethics of cultural dissent - intuitive to Young, then 37 - were new to both Poitier and his characters. And Young eventually withdrew from A Piece of the Action before completion. Almost 25 years later, armed with an engine of charming anecdotes, Young chortles loudly: 'I have memories of a kind and warm man. Someone genuinely dedicated to his craft. But someone, nevertheless, deeply troubled by his fame. It seemed like success, in return, had exacted some horrible price. It's like I remember his Oscar - it was permanently displayed on the floor, keeled over.'</p> <p>Young recalls an incident at the Poitier residence in 1976. 'Sidney always made a big thing out of the fact that he never owned a Rolls-Royce nor a Mercedes. It seemed to keep him in touch with the working classes, so instead,' says Young, laughing, 'he had all these Cadillacs. He displayed a natural empathy towards the working class, but in many ways he was the classic poolside socialist.</p> <p>'Anyway, one day his car breaks down, so he calls the repairman. The guy who showed up was black. He took an instant dislike to Sidney - and treated him with contempt. The look of disgust was unbelievable. It was like Poitier embodied all the evils of someone who had sold out the cause. And Poitier took that very badly. It upset him a great deal.'</p> <p>The popular denunciation of Poitier throughout the late 60s and 70s knew no limits. Black nationalist H Rap Brown deplored his 'Uncle Tom' characterisations. Poitier was more famously immortalised in Amiri Baraka's 1978 play, Sidney Poetical Heroical -a cruel satire that ridiculed the actor as a cheap white liberal gambit on race relations. And three years later, The New York Times published an article, entitled 'Why do white folks love Sidney Poitier so?'</p> <p>'I don't wanna get into that,' Poitier tells me, wringing his hands. 'It's all so deep and so complicated.' His stoicism rarely permits him to elucidate on those barbed attacks. In The Measure of a Man, he notes: 'The heated tempers of that time have long since cooled, and ideological fashions have come and gone.' The line indicates a fractional victory, but better illustrates, on the whole, his seclusion from the counter cultural debate.</p> <p>'He just wasn't of those times,' says Young. 'His was an era of polite gentlemanly etiquette. Hollywood was warming to blaxploitation movies like Shaft. I remember going to his house in 1976, and Sidney and his wife left me in the garden. I sat down on the grass and started reading a copy of Rolling Stone magazine - I was a writer for them. Suddenly, the upstairs window opened and there was Sidney. \"Al,\" he exclaimed. \"What are you doing?\" I told him I was sitting on the grass. \"But we never do that!\" he yelled. \"My God! Can I get you a chair?\"'</p> <p>Later in the afternoon, Poitier, un-prompted, revisits his period of wretchedness. His voice is hushed. In fact, his hands better demonstrate his emotions. 'It was a time when rage had matured to an uncontrollable response,' he breathes. 'The black community had made almost no dent in what was a bogus democracy that said it was a democracy. And the people who looked at my career saw two things. They saw what these liberal white filmmakers were doing, and they loved it. Because it was new and it was saying, \"We are unique.\" The revolutionaries, however, had this convoluted attitude, because it was time for revolution, or whatever. They thought I was too good, too well educated, too refined.' Poitier laughs, and shakes his head. 'Hell, partner,' he winks. 'I couldn't fight that. I didn't even try.' </p> <p>Poitier's wife glides into view from a back room. Joanna Shimkus, 57, is a local TV star in Hollywood; the couple married in 1976. 'Why don't you take the young man out for some lunch? Aren't you hungry, dear?' she tells Poitier. Shimkus wanders off back to the kitchen, through the lounge, idly inspecting Poitier's cultural bric-a-brac. </p> <p>'Sidney?' she exclaims. Poitier rises to his feet, 'Yes, darling?' Shimkus holds up a leg from the stool broken earlier. 'We really do have to get something done about these antique chairs. This one keeps breaking.' </p> <p>I throw a determined glare at Poitier, who blankly stares back. 'You're a damn liar!' I yell. 'Do you have any idea how self-conscious that incident made me feel all afternoon?' Poitier throws his head back and laughs. He slaps me on the knees, 'C'mon kid, let's get some food.'</p> <p>Downstairs at the Sierra Towers's reception desk, Poitier kicks back with the receptionist. 'Isn't she sweet?' he says. He points at me, 'You don't wanna get involved with this guy.' The receptionist, tall, black, lithe, her clothes seemingly lacquered on to her skeleton, giggles and flashes her eyebrows. 'Mr Poitier,' she writhes. 'I'll remember to take your advice.' Poitier glides into his black BMW and the car sails towards Beverly Hills. 'Fuck it, let's have a proper lunch,' he murmurs. At traffic lights, pedestrians stop and squint through his open driver's window. Poitier ignores the squeals of recognition. 'You'll love this restaurant,' he says.</p> <p>Poitier steers the BMW into the car park behind Spago, the renowned Beverley Hills eatery, whose kitchen is directed by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. Going past 3pm, we've missed lunch. 'But we might just catch something,' says Poitier. A dim hallway leads us inside, where four waiters sit .around a table, anticipating the evening melee.</p> <p>'Mr Poitier, always good to see you,' cries one. Locally, his name is pronounced 'Poy-tiere'. Another waiter leaps to attention: 'Lunch, Mr Poy-tiere? No problem, let me show you to your favourite table.' We are both hustled into our seats amid a flurry of newly spread tablecovers, fresh napkins and polished crockery. Puck walks by, double-takes, and halts at the table. 'Sidney,' he laughs, fondly. 'Always good to see you. I have a wonderful salad. A dressing to die for.' </p> <p>The lunch is magnificent. Methodically working through a green salad, Poitier says: 'I get offered work these days.' He is currently considering resigning from his post as ambassador to Japan from the Bahamas - he was appointed to the position in 1997. And he last appeared in cinemas in The Jackal, a 1997 remake of the original, starring Bruce Willis. 'But something's always wrong, either the scripts or the directors.' He looks at me: the burden of his 50-year long filmography etched on to his face. He says, 'I have to consider my past, all those other films. Anything after it has to fit in.'</p> <p>We drive back to Sierra Towers and for the first time all day the conversation is conducted by goofy fascinations and trivial interests. Poitier laughs at my accent, and I guffaw at this elderly man's still-intact wonderment of life. 'I think I have an average curiosity,' he admits. He stops the car in front of the apartment block and shakes my hand - there's that firm, diplomatic grip again. 'I guess I'll get that chair fixed now,' he laughs. And Poitier, who signalled in the era of intelligentsia in post-war filmmaking, disappears soundlessly into the building.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,4120,379043,00.html\">Read Philip French's analysis of Poitier's career here</a>.</p> <p>\u0095 The Measure of a Man by Sidney Poitier is published by Simon &amp; Schuster for \u00a316.99.</p>",
  "<p> In the mid-Fities when I was 14 or 15, I told my mother I was homosexual: that was the word, back then, homosexual, in its full satanic majesty, a combination of evil and sickness. </p> <p>Of course, I'd learned the word from her. She was a psychologist. Throughout my early childhood, she'd been studying part-time for a master's degree in child psychology. Since I was not only her son but also her best friend, she confided everything she was learning about me - her live-in guinea pig - to me. </p> <p>When I was seven, my parents divorced. My mother had ordered my father to choose between her and his mistress (who doubled as his secretary); he chose the mistress. My mother was devastated. Although she had a giant capacity for reinterpreting every loss as a gain, even she couldn't find something positive in divorce. </p> <p>It was a good thing she'd taken that degree because now, at 45, she had to go to work to supplement her meagre alimony. She laboured long hours for low pay as a state psychologist in Illinois and Texas, administering IQ tests to hundreds of grade school students and even 'projective' tests (the Rorschach, the House-Tree-Person) to children suspected of being 'disturbed'. </p> <p>I was tested frequently. She, who was so often overwrought at home, given to rages or fits of weeping, would become strangely calm and professional when administering a test. Her hands would make smoothing gestures, her voice was lowered and given a story-telling sweetness ('Now, Eddie, could you tell me everything you see in this ink blot?'). I, too, was transformed when tested, but toward anxiety, since a psychological test was like an X-ray or a blood test, likely to reveal a lurking disease: hostility, perversion or craziness or, even worse, a low intelligence. </p> <p>There was nothing consistent or logical about my mother's thinking. She found me wise to the point of genius and often said she wanted to write a book about raising the Exceptional Child ('Let him take the lead - he will teach you what he wants to learn'). But then I was also half-crazy, dangerously unbalanced, 'borderline psychotic' with 'strong schizophrenic tendencies', suspiciously apt at imitating wisdom and understanding, a flatterer, a robot programmed to resemble a thinking, feeling human being.</p> <p> I'd read in one of my mother's psychological manuals a long entry on homosexuality that I could scarcely understand. But I did take in that whereas adult homosexuality was an entrenched ego disorder caused by an unresolved Oedipus complex and resulting in secondary narcissistic gains that were especially hard to uproot, in every early adolescence, the individual, the boy, passes through a homosexual stage that is perfectly normal, a brief swirl around the Scylla of orality and the Charybdis of anality before surging to the sunny, open seas of mature genitality. I could only hope that I was just passing through a phase. </p> <p>After I told her I was homosexual, my mother sent me to a Freudian psychiatrist for an evaluation. I had just read Oscar Wilde and was determined to be as brittle and brilliant as his characters. I sat on the edge of my chair, hectic red flowers blowing in my cheeks, and rattled on and on about my condition, my illness, which I was no more able to defend than Wilde could. </p> <p>The psychiatrist told my mother that I was 'unsalvageable', that I should be locked up and the key thrown away. My mother reported this scary judgment to me, and to my father, though I begged her not to. Of course, neither she nor I was capable of dismissing this diagnosis as a dangerously narrow-minded prejudice held by a banal little suburbanite in a brown suit. No, it came from a doctor and was as unquestionable as a diagnosis of diabetes or cancer. The doctor's level of sophistication or humanity was irrelevant. I began to read books about psychoanalysis - Freud himself, especially The Introduction to Psychoanalysis and The Interpretation of Dreams, but also the softer, less pessimistic American adaptations of his thought by Erich Fromm. I couldn't find much about homosexuality in any book, but enough to know it was sterile, inauthentic, endlessly repetitious and infantile. </p> <p>Somewhere, I came across the theory that homosexuality was caused by an absent father and a suffocating mother. Perhaps my mother had been the one to suggest that my father's absence had queered me, for she was always eager to work out the multiple ways in which his desertion had harmed us all. </p> <p>Eventually, I asked my father to send me to a shrink. The father of a schoolfriend was a psychiatrist who recommended me to James Clark Moloney. </p> <p>I had no idea what to expect at Dr Moloney's practice in a Detroit suburb, but I certainly thought he'd be a small man with a varnished pate and an inky comb-over, many books (some in German) and in his waiting-room the sorry smell of old tobacco. I was in no way prepared for the cages of shrieking birds, the Papuan deities and, in the garden as seen through a plate-glass window, a gilt statue of a meditating bodhisattva. I fancied myself a Buddhist but of the austere Theravada sort, and I sniffed at Dr Moloney's idolatry, even though I'd come here precisely because I sought a compassionate intercessor, a bodhisattva of my own. </p> <p>He had a leonine mane of white hair, a bulbous nose with a sore on one side, close to the tip, which he kept vaguely clawing at, as an old dog will half-heartedly try to free itself of its collar. He wore sandals on big, yellow-nailed feet, shapeless trousers held up with a rope, a short-sleeved Hawaiian shirt. He licked his lips constantly. He made me feel very prim, especially since I'd put on my favourite Brooks Brothers suit. </p> <p>Moloney had but one master theory and he proposed it to everyone as an answer to every ill. He believed in the introjected mother. Every infant has the right to expect and enjoy unconditional love from his mother, at full throttle and all the time. Modern women, however, are deformed by societal inhibitions and their own deprivations as children. They are incapable of giving complete, nourishing love; when I told Dr Moloney that my mother hadn't breast-fed me because she had inverted nipples, he slapped his knees, let out a great cry and leapt to his feet. 'You see!' </p> <p>The emotionally starved, alienated child decides to mother himself. The faint, elusive image of his mother's face and warmth he incorporates into his inner pantheon. Now he is no longer dependent on her vagaries and caprices. Now he can beam her up whenever he needs her. If he sucks his thumb, he is nursing himself. He has become a closed circuit - with only one crucial disadvantage: such total independence is virtually synonymous with madness. He has lost all vital connection to the outside world. </p> <p>When he thinks he has fallen in love with a real woman, in point of fact all he has done is to project his mother's imago on to a neutral screen. Since he's not relating to a real person in all her shifting specificity but instead to the fixed outlines of the introjected mother, he cannot interact with the flesh-and-blood woman. As an infant, he learned how dangerous it was to open up to an actual, autonomous Other. I was taught all this during my very first hour with Dr Moloney - or rather my first 90 minutes, since he was eager to prove to me he was not like one of those goddamn tightass Freudians with their finicky, fucking 50-minute hours. He also needed to lay out his entire theory during our first encounter so that it could begin to sink in. </p> <p>As I learned in session after session, Dr Moloney had served in the Pacific as an army doctor. There, in Okinawa, he had observed that infants were fearless and happy because they never left their mother's side; they were carried everywhere, papoose-style, bound to their mother's back, their heads looking out above hers - 'that way they feel united to her but in charge'. Moloney loved to insult my parents ('Don't think I'm a castrating asshole like your father, an anal perfectionist...') and believed he could give me the unconditional love that he thought I craved and that his version of my mother had denied me. He would often interrupt me to say: 'I love you, goddamn it.' His eyes would fill with tears and he'd idly pick at his infected nose or come at the sore on his forehead from above, fat fingers stretching down, his elbow cocked to the ceiling. But on some days he had to search for my name. </p> <p>As best I could figure out, he'd had a more conventional past, reflected in his first, unimpeachably Freudian book, but now he'd become cracked over the introjected mother and the Okinawan papoose cure. He wore heavy turquoise and silver bracelets, black amulets on his hairy chest and lived surrounded by bobbing, chiming deities from the Pacific, Asia and Africa (Freud had inaugurated this taste for carved African statues, as photos of his Vienna cabinet revealed). </p> <p>The other Freudian remnant was the couch. As I lay on it, Moloney, out of sight behind me, took notes (or wrote something, perhaps one of his pamphlets). I could hear him back there at his desk coughing or rummaging around for something or scratching with his pen. More than once, I caught him dozing. That he was asleep changed his preceding silence in my eyes from a sharp, therapeutic instrument into an obtuse abnegation. I bored him. This man who claimed to love me was zoning out on me. 'I know what you're thinking,' he shouted. 'You're probably mad as hell. And you have a right to be. You have a right to unqualified love. No time limits, no lapses, eternal, unqualified love. But even Homer nods. The baby squalls, and he's completely in his rights. If I were perfect - and you deserve perfection, it's your birthright.' Here he got confused and scratched his nose. </p> <p>He considered my tendency to over-intellectualise one of my most serious defences. If I disagreed with one of his interpretations, he'd laugh, show his small white teeth and say: 'If you go on winning every argument this way you'll soon enough lose every chance at happiness. No one around here doubts your intelligence. It's just that I want you to break out of your closed circuit and touch another living human being, goddamn it.' And here he groped for my name before sketching in a feeble gesture that ended in a shrug. I learned to question all my impulses, to second-guess my motives, to ascribe a devious, unconscious purpose to my most unobjectionable actions. If I had a dream about making love to Marilyn Monroe, Moloney would interpret it as a 'flight into health', a ruse I'd invented to throw him off my track by appearing normal, cured. 'In this dream, I'm Marilyn Monroe,' he'd say, perfectly seriously. 'Like her I have long hair, a wide mouth, I'm voluptuously put together.'</p> <p> I saw Moloney three times a week during my last two years at school but I could never get him to concentrate on my homosexuality. 'You'll see, old boy,' he'd assure me, 'Once we clear away the psychic underbrush all that will wither away.' He wasn't even very interested in my sexual adventures at school and elsewhere, though he warned me that 'excessive acting out' would make me less sensitive to treatment. If I entered into detail about my love for a teacher or my sexual bribery of a football star, he'd wave his hand as if brushing cobwebs out of his face and say: 'Spare me, spare me.' When I asked him if smoking marijuana was dangerous, he assured me it led directly to heroin addiction. </p> <p>The only moment when Moloney would truly pay attention to me was when I reported a dream to him. He was Freudian, I suppose, in believing that a dream was 'the royal road to the unconscious'. Now I agree with an Italian doctor friend who ascribes the primacy of dreams in Freud's system to the Viennese habit of eating cheese after dinner. Like Freud, Moloney felt that one of the analyst's main tools is picking through the transference. Freud, however, insists that the patient must know nothing concrete about the analyst, so that it will be clear even to him that he has invented everything and attributed it to the doctor. In the classic Freudian transference, the analysand recreates with his analyst his damaging relationship with his parents; when he recognises that the doctor has done nothing at all to justify such wrath, resentment or fear, he is forced to admit (and abandon) his habit of endlessly 'projecting' bad motives and harmful feelings on to everyone around him. </p> <p>With Moloney, however, the experiment was compromised. Because he constantly chattered about himself I did know a lot about him, which I had the right to interpret as I saw fit. He might say: 'Stop projecting!' but only his authority lent credibility to such an objection. He was my first shrink, I had nothing to compare him to and he was my only chance of becoming a heterosexual, of ending the terrible suffering I was enduring as an outcast. He told me so himself; he was certain he was the only qualified doctor around. I contemplated suicide more than once. </p> <p>Moloney convinced me that I should not go away for school (I had been accepted at Harvard) but should attend a nearby state university so that I could continue my sessions with him. He had close to 50 patients now and was seeing them from six in the morning till midnight, seven days a week. To stay awake, he was swallowing handfuls of Dexedrine and then coming down in the evening with constant swigs of bourbon. I'd drive every week the 50 miles from Ann Arbor into Detroit in a borrowed car. I'd have the 11pm hour, when Moloney was smiley and drunk, then I'd sleep on the analytic couch and awaken him, with great difficulty, for the 6am session. I'd have to blast him out of bed by playing his favourite record, 'There Is Nothing Like a Dame'. </p> <p>His own life was beginning to come apart, he told me. He'd fallen in love with a patient who was seriously ill and he'd left his wife for her. But then, when his wife was diagnosed with a terminal illness, he'd gone back to her. Now his wife was dead and the patient was in a mental hospital. </p> <p>Moloney seemed more and more disoriented. He was often confused, no longer just the overworked, sometimes indifferent, forgetful doctor but someone obviously lost. He'd aged quickly. He forgot to shave and sometimes he smelled of hangover. His hands trembled and he no longer took notes. His old bravado still hung from him in rags, as if he were a scarecrow in a field the farmer had let go fallow. I was bitter because I saw I had sacrificed my academic career to him, to the forsaken prospect of being cured. At the same time, I felt a deep affection for him, because he was vulnerable and hurt. </p> <p>I discovered that despite his medical training and his years of psychoanalytic experience, he was sure that there was nothing in a male homosexual that couldn't be straightened out by a good woman - or even just a woman. I decided to break with him but when I thought of driving into Birmingham to tell him, my unconscious invented several excuses. My eyes swelled up - 'angio-neurotic oedema' was Moloney's diagnosis over the phone: 'skin rage'. He added: 'The baby is swelling up like a poisonous toad in order to scare off the Good Mother, me, in this case.' My foot became swollen and infected; I was hospitalised in the school infirmary. </p> <p>At last, I decided I'd never get well until I broke with Moloney. When I limped into his office, I saw that the sore on his nose had become the size of a quarter and he'd let his brows grow so shaggy that they half covered his eyes. Through this white fringe, he looked out at me with huge, red eyes. For some reason I thought of a white plant feasting on shadow and decay - a mushroom. </p> <p>'I'm leaving you,' I said, my voice hard and unsteady. 'I can't go on seeing you. It's not working out.' I had prepared many arguments but I didn't need them. Moloney said: 'You're right. I think you're right.' </p> <p>I was never sure of what became of him. One of his old patients said he had given up his practice and moved to Mexico. Another said he'd lost his mind and been confined to an asylum. </p> <p> After him, I had an orthodox Freudian from Vienna who'd renamed herself Alice Chester. At least her name didn't really go with her heavy German accent and her Jewishness; I invented a difficult war for her, possibly a concentration camp. I probably invented her Jewishness as well as her name change. I knew nothing about her except that she was a small, heavy-lidded woman who smiled with an irony that seemed at once exhausted and twinkly, if that's possible. She almost never 'offered an interpretation'. I knew from my reading that a strict Freudian, the sort I'd been longing to see, didn't offer interpretations during the first half-year of treatment. Although I was analysed by her for two years, she never said much. I longed for a detailed reconstruction of my infancy and childhood, week by week, but she never delivered. Sometimes, I feared she didn't really understand English; her constant, ironic smile could just as well have been benign incomprehension or a frightened camouflage of her ignorance. </p> <p>Once, when I was talking about how I 'identified' with Harry Haller, the suicidal hero of Hermann Hesse's Steppenwolf , she exhaled smoke, then suddenly lit up with recognition and eagerly exclaimed, ' Ach! Der Steppenwolf! ' She nodded vigorously and smiled hugely. The air was juicy with the explosive German words. </p> <p>How she must have missed Vienna as she sat there in her tidy little house in the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak, a thousand miles from the nearest caf\u00e9. How she must have resented that dim, larval life of Detroit, to which irony or self-consciousness would have seemed as irrelevant and unusable as jalape\u00f1os in Cracow. I sometimes told friends at school that my shrink was a member of 'the original Vienna Circle', as if she'd worked with Freud himself, which was just possible chronologically if she was as old as the century (I had no idea of her age). </p> <p>Once she said she thought my school friends sounded as if they were self-amused and non-relating, which I instantly repeated with whoops of exaggerated laughter to them. For I'd discovered a few other gay guys in Ann Arbor and I regaled them with stories about my shrink. They'd hold their sides, weep with merriment and shout: ' Ach! Der Steppenwolf !' We thought we were terminally sophisticated.</p> <p> When I graduated and moved to New York in 1962, I was too poor to afford a psychoanalyst. I was no longer on my father's payroll. Besides, I was too immersed in Greenwich Village gay life to want to be cured right away. Two years later, however, I was back in psychotherapy, this time with Frances Alexander, a PhD psychologist who conducted groups and practised something called 'transactional therapy'. At that time, in 1965, even sophisticates had not yet learned to ridicule 'New Age' or 'California feel-good' systems. I never read the bestselling book on which that system (now forgotten) was based, but apparently it labelled most exchanges between people according to a fairly limited taxonomy of games or transactions. </p> <p>Therapy, as best I could tell from our group sessions, was aimed at unmasking these strategies in order to force the participants to return to (or invent) a sincere, heartfelt communication of feeling. We learned not to play the martyr ('Poor Me!' another client would cry out triumphantly), nor to invoke authority, nor to induce guilt in others, nor to cloak our healthy anger in humble depression ('Let it out, goddamn it!'). Freudian psychoanalysis, with its high fees, its glacial slowness, its obsession with childhood sexuality, incest, dreams, the unconscious, the patriarch, the anus, with its arrogant conviction that the patient should be kept ignorant of its methods and theories, was already foundering, challenged by the more democratic group therapy and its principle of every man his own shrink. </p> <p>And then Stonewall came along, the uprising in Greenwich Village in June 1969, which announced the beginning of gay liberation. Feminism, the sexual revolution and the Vietnam War protests were in full force. It was just a matter of moments before the cards were reshuffled and someone shouted 'Gay is good,' to make a grand slam with 'Black is beautiful'. </p> <p>Not immediately but soon enough, Freudian psychology went up in flames and became no more powerful or present than the smell of ashes in a cold fireplace the morning after. Most of the problems Freudianism had addressed were no longer experienced as an individual need to adapt to conventions, but as conventions that needed to adapt to individuals. Everyone asserted his or her rights. In the Fifties, people had been ashamed to admit they were inadequate; in the Sixties, they became proud to announce they were victims. Psychoanalysis had been addressed to shame culture; identity politics addressed a culture of complaint. Rilke had said: 'You must change yourself!' but now people said: 'Everyone else must change.' </p> <p>In the mid-Seventies, during an unhappy love affair, I sought help from Charles Silverstein, a gay psychotherapist. He was one of the psychologists who had led the so-called 'nomenclature' battle in the American Psychological Association. A band of gay therapists had convinced the larger organisation to reclassify homosexuality as falling within the normal range of behaviour instead of as being an ego disorder. Just by going to him, I'd already scrambled all the rules of the game; now I wanted to be a happy gay rather than a rehabilitated homosexual. </p> <p>Charles was as eccentric as Dr Moloney had been but not at all crazy. Charles was fat and chain-smoked, wore sandals and sloppy clothes and, of course, he had the usual carved African deities in his West Side living-room. He was pleasant but made no protestations of love. Love was irrelevant, which seemed more honest. For the first time, I'd found a shrink who listened with what I might call a fresh ear. </p> <p>He seemed to have few preconceived ideas. When I complained of low self-esteem, he had me look in a mirror and list all my weak points and strong points; I was shocked to find out the strengths were twice as numerous. Sexual dysfunctions he approached in a straightforward behaviourist fashion - he refused to psychologise them. </p> <p>For the more mysterious regions of the psyche, he traced out surprising new cause-and-effect relationships, tailor-made to me. I'd imagine I'd ended one subject (my father's death) and begun another (writer's block), but he'd show how the first caused the second. He taught me the ways in which internalised homophobia had left its traces all over me, like a lapdog's muddy footprints on clean sheets. He gave a strong impression that he didn't see himself as an authority, much less as a judge, but rather as a technician, someone who could put his professional training at my disposal. The possibility of transference was never discussed. </p> <p>He was a Gestalt psychologist. I never figured out what that meant except in dream interpretation. Where someone like Alice Chester would interpret the props and personages in a dream as stand-ins for real events and people, Silverstein saw each element in the dream as one part of the personality interacting with every other. He'd invite me to be the sail and the compass, the sun and the shark, and to speak for them. The dialogue felt more complex and representative, even if in the end it was just as arbitrary. </p> <p> Two decades later, in the fall of 1993, I started seeing my last or at least latest shrink. My young French lover, Hubert Sorin, was dying. I found a gay American therapist, Rik Gitlin, who hailed from San Francisco. Although I had been living in Paris for a decade I didn't want a French psychoanalyst. I despised Lacan, France's answer to Freud, a charlatan who counted his money while his patients talked and who invented the 20-minute 'hour' and felt authorised to reduce it to five minutes if the spirit so moved him, probably so he could cram in an even more lucrative turnover. I wanted to talk to my own kind of funny, disabused American gay man, someone who would laugh when I laughed and who developed his ideas by moving from anecdote to anecdote. </p> <p>Rik was perfect. He was in his thirties, cute, bright, respectful (I was nearly twice his age). We sat in good chairs and looked at each other; the couch had been relegated to the Freudian attic. He took notes after each session and kept track of my numerous friends, as complicated as those cast lists that used to appear at the beginning of nineteenth-century Russian novels. Rik was one of the 'What-I'm-hearing-is-a-certain-amount-of-shame' school of therapy in which the psychologist peers through the client's social smiles and ironic demurrals to discern the stark outlines of his real feelings, often the opposite of those he intends to convey. This method depends on sound instincts, a nearly canine perception of signals pitched above the ordinary range of human hearing. Rik was gifted with this sort of sensitivity. He was also very companionable. </p> <p>When I reflect upon my life, which has been touched by psychotherapy in every decade, I realise that during my youth, Freudianism was my main form of intellectuality, a severe, engrossing discipline too devoid of comforting to serve as a substitute for religion. Freudianism developed in me an interest in the individual and his or her sexual development and a strong sense that the progression from one stage to another could go in only one direction in someone healthy. </p> <p>The 'residue' of this indoctrination was a narrow, normative view of humanity. But when I came to reject Freudianism in my late twenties, I replaced it with its opposite - an interest in groups rather than individuals, a morality that was situationist rather than absolute, and a rejection of every urge to 'totalise,' if that means to submit experience to one master theory. Psychoanalysis did leave me with a few beliefs, including the conviction that everyone is worthy of years and years of intense scrutiny, not a bad credo for a novelist. </p> <p>I remember that Nabokov (or one of his characters) argues that Freud thought we admire a woman's hair because we desire her body, whereas the truth is we want to sleep with her because we're so awestruck by her beautiful hair. A novelist can work with Nabokov's insight because it respects the details, the sensuous surface, of experience, but not with Freud's, which is arid and reductive. I sought out therapy when I was deeply unhappy, driven by desires I wanted to eradicate because I felt they were infantile, grotesque, damaging and isolating. I was never cured, but society changed and redefined homosexuality as an orientation that was acceptable, or nearly so. </p> <p> This is an edited version of Edmund White's essay, 'Shrinks', which appears in this month's issue of Granta.

  "For the stone-throwers it was a rare victory. For once they had triumphed against the sniper rifles and machine guns of the Israeli Army. <p>At dawn yesterday a squad of 10 Israeli border policemen abandoned the bunkers in the West Bank town of Nablus where they had been besieged for nine days and made their way back to less exposed positions. On their way, one was shot and wounded. </p> <p>Within minutes, masked Palestinians had broken into the army base and the Jewish shrine of Joseph's Tomb that it was built to protect. Fires were started and religious texts destroyed. </p> <p>The withdrawal from Nablus was made on the orders of the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak. It was the first time that Israeli forces have been forced to pull back as a result of Palestinian violence, and a deeply significant moment. </p> <p>But if the move was meant to put an end to the unrest engulfing Israel and the Palestinian territories, it failed. Clashes recurred yesterday in Gaza and spread elsewhere. Israeli troops killed at least one Palestinian after opening fire on a demonstration at the Lebanese border. </p> <p>More than 80 people have died and 2,000 have been injured in the violence of the last 10 days. Almost all have been Palestinian, and most have been young. </p> <p>Earlier last week, at the major flashpoint of Netzarim Junction in Gaza, The Observer' s reporter watched close hand as angry and excited Arab youths hurled themselves in front of the Israeli guns. They started huddled against a breeze-block wall. Most were stripped to the waist, their bodies black with soot from petrol bombs and streaked by sweat. In their hands were rocks, Palestinian flags and bottles. </p> <p>In twos and threes they leapt through a gap in the wall and charged towards the squat bunkers of the base 30 yards away. Behind them scores more youths, and a handful of older men, shouted encouragement. The air was full of the crackle of flames and shouts of ' Allahu akbar ' (God is great). </p> <p>Every 15 or so minutes, the welter of noise was sliced by a single, sharp report. Each time, with his features twisted in pain, a young man, a youth or a boy aged no older than 10 was carried from the rubble to the ambulances waiting yards away. For hours, the pattern continued. The youths rushed forward, hurling their petrol bombs and bricks. The Israelis carefully, clinically, deliberately dropped one. And the youths merely regrouped and came forward again. They were literally lining up to die. </p> <p>Last week saw mayhem and carnage in Israel and the Palestinian Territories of Gaza and the West Bank on a scale not seen for decades. This troubled land's fate is now in the hands of the extremists, the bigots and the violent. The moderate majority on both sides can only look on in horror. The televised shooting of 12-year-old Mohammed al-Durrah and his father, Jamal, at Netzarim Junction has shaken the country. </p> <p>The Israelis are now asking themselves: how can such killing ever be justified? Was it too many or too few concessions to the Palestinians that caused the explosion? Can the fragile minority government of Prime Minister Barak - who was elected as a peacemaker in May last year - survive the crisis? A newspaper poll last week showed that more than 70 per cent of Israelis felt that the future existence of their country was in doubt. </p> <p>And questions are also being asked in the scrappy, rundown towns and refugee camps run by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian National Authority (PNA). Was the violence orchestrated? Is there any truth in Israeli accusations that their leader has knowingly been sending young Palestinians out to die to score political points? Is it time, they are asking, to forget negotiations and rely on the gun? </p> <p>In the town of Beni Suhaila, in the middle of the 30-mile-long Gaza Strip, they have an answer to the latter, at least. </p> <p>On Wednesday, Mohammed Abu-Assi, an 11-year-old shot dead while throwing stones the day before, was buried. Thousands filled the street to follow his open coffin. Many mourners carried automatic weapons. Some of them carried the green flag of Hamas - the Islamic group responsible for suicide-bomb attacks. </p> <p>The boy's grieving female relatives watched the procession. His younger sister wept. But Umralib, his mother, said she would shed no tears. 'He is a martyr. He is in paradise. He died as a sacrifice for his religion and for our city of Jerusalem. This struggle must go on. There has been enough talking. It is time to fight.' </p> <p>The recent unrest was sparked when, 10 days ago, the veteran right-wing Israeli politician Ariel Sharon, guarded by 1,000 police, visited al-Aqsa's hilltop compound in Jerusalem's walled Old City. His aim was to underline Jewish sovereignty over the site, the third most holy place in Islam, and over Jerusalem as a whole. For Jews, the site is also sacred. But Muslims felt the visit of Sharon, who has a brutal record, violated the sanctity of the shrine - and riots broke out. Within days, the Israelis had deployed tanks. </p> <p>A new religious element fuelled the fighting. A hastily drawn picture on the wall of Mohammed Abu-Assi's home in Beni Suhaila showed the boy's body being borne to paradise with the words 'al-Aqsa' issuing from his mouth. As youths rioted, they shouted the name of the mosque - a rallying cry to Muslims throughout the world. In other Islamic countries there were violent demonstrations in support. </p> <p>But the roots of the Palestinian anger lie deeper - in resentment over the glacial pace of the peace process and their appalling economic conditions. Israelis were particularly shocked to see, for the first time, significant numbers of the million or so Arabs who are Israeli citizens taking to the barricades in Galilee. </p> <p>'We talk and talk for years and nothing happens. So maybe this is the only way. I may be an Israeli citizen, but I am a Muslim and a Palestinian first,' said Hussein, an east Jerusalem market trader, last week. </p> <p>Elsewhere the scenes were more familiar. Gaza, Bethlehem, Ramallah and Nablus were all key sites during the previous 'Intifada' ('shaking off') in the late Eighties. </p> <p>At Netzarim and Ramallah, the focus of anger were the settlements set up by hardline Jews. </p> <p>'Why are they here? This is our land,' said a heavily armed PNA security officer visiting the wounded in Ramallah hospital. He said a gun battle had broken out after the settlers on the hill above the town fired on Palestinian homes. Two local youths had been killed. </p> <p>The settlers say local Palestinian youths - and PNA security officials - often shoot at their houses. Sometimes, they said, they returned fire. </p> <p>The settlers are not popular in Israel. A recent poll showed that 51 per cent of Israeli Jews called themselves 'secular'. Many of the soldiers assigned to protect the settlers see them as troublemakers. </p> <p>But it is also clear that the violence can be controlled. On Wednesday, while negotiations continued in Paris between Barak and Arafat, the riots were small-scale. On Friday - declared a 'day of rage' by the Palestinian leadership - Jerusalem and Gaza erupted. </p> <p>There is little hope of a swift end to the chaos engulfing the county, although Barak's order to withdraw from Nablus may help calm things down. However, his weak political position prohibits major concessions. Yesterday the moderates remained unheard and the extremists dug in. </p> <p>Benny Elon, a right-wing Israeli politician, admitted that the Israelis had lost a battle last week. But, he told me, they 'would win the war'. </p> <p>Abdullah al-Masri, a senior Palestinian security officer at Netzarim Junction, pledged the same. 'We will go on until we have spilt every drop of our blood. The future is black. The clouds will rain bullets.'</p>"
