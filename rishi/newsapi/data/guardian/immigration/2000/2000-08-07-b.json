  "<p> Munnery's entrance is one of the most stunning things on the fringe. In a hail of dry ice and double-entendres, the bespectacled maniac rides in on top of a silver ice-cream van that doubles as a time machine. An enormous computerised screen declares Munnery's self-styled superiority. We, the humble masses, are \"scum\", our church McDonald's. Sadly, thereafter things fall flat. </p> <p>On a good night Munnery can be one of the funniest, most thought-provoking experiences in comedy, but on a bad one he is infuriating. You'd think that after four years this inconsistency would have been ironed out, but no - things have hardly got going before the computer that controls his video screen (an integral part of the show) crashes. Catastrophe can trigger Munnery's finest rapid-fire wit; this time he fails to seize the opportunity, even when Abba blares in from the next tent. Instead, we feel sympathy as the \"superior\" being is all but drowned out by Dancing Queen. </p> <p>When you can hear them, Munnery's sniping one-liners are wonderful. However, much of the material seems familiar, and some are just not very funny. The technical problems will presumably be overcome, but this is a weak show. </p> <p> Till August 27.

  "<p>Women are very much on top at Edinburgh this year. Not only are the most substantial new plays coming from women writers, but three major fringe productions have reminded us of the extent to which women have always provided mythical theatrical archetypes. Seeing variations on Ibsen's Nora, Euripides's Medea and Wedekind's Lulu in close proximity you understand how independence is only achieved through terrifying personal sacrifice. </p> <p>The mystery about the National Theatre of Norway's outstanding production of A Doll's House at the Lyceum is why it is only playing three performances on the fringe; it cries out to be a part of Brian McMaster's international festival. While respecting Ibsen's text, it brings out more clearly than any version I have seen the way Nora is forced into a life of domestic prostitution. Having forged a document to pay her husband's life-saving medical bills, she is driven into all kinds of sexual humiliation to conceal the truth. </p> <p>Anneke von der Lippe's Nora, a vivacious brunette in a low-cut red dress, is clearly accustomed to private whoring. The bird-noises she makes as she literally leaps into Torvald's arms are part of a masochistic sexual ritual. When she tells him that \"the skylark will do tricks\" she goes on all fours and provocatively wiggles her bum at him. Sex is this Nora's secret weapon. But its over-use reduces her to bulimic, suicidal desperation as she vomits up the macaroons she constantly stuffs in her mouth. Her final declaration of independence becomes all the more powerful because we have seen the humiliations imposed on her by marital captivity. It is a brilliant performance in a first-rate production by Kjetil Bang-Hansen. </p> <p>Where Nora leaves her children, Medea, in Liz Lochhead's pugnacious adaptation for Theatre Babel at the Assembly Rooms, deploys them as an instrument of revenge, then murders them. </p> <p>What is startling about Lochhead's version is that Medea emerges as neither superhuman goddess nor foreign witch, more an archetypal example of the wronged woman driven to retaliatory violence. Maureen Beattie endows Medea with a European refugee accent, a vehement dignity and an unusual degree of complicity with the audience. Informing us that women wronged in bed will \"have your guts for garters\", she reaches out to the front row with a terrifying balls-crunching gesture. </p> <p>Beattie's performance has tremendous visceral power and sexual authority. My only cavil about Lochhead's version and Graham McLaren's production is that they mitigate the horror of Medea's infanticide. Medea's justification of their murder - that she is saving them from the hands of her enemies - is treated as a cool political ploy and the play becomes a straightforward feminist endorsement of her actions. But it gains a propulsive contemporaneity that has men in the audience shifting uneasily in their seats. </p> <p>After this, a Danish cabaret version of Lulu, based both on the Wedekind play and the Pabst movie, presented by Odense Internationale Musikteater at the Assembly Rooms, comes as light relief. Chris Jordan's songs have echoes of Weill, Wagner, Bizet, Christmas carols and country-and-western, and the show has a smoky, late-night loucheness. But behind the atmosphere of sophisticated decadence we are reminded that Sonja Richter's Lulu, the sexual free-spirit finally destroyed by Jack the Ripper, is close kin to Nora and Medea. She is the exotic other who sacrifices herself on the altar of male fantasy and suffers accordingly. She also proves that, so far at the Edinburgh fringe this year, it is women who are calling the shots and defining the shits.</p>",
  "<p>Sources close to the editor of this paper, it may be revealed, are working hard at constructing a code which will give his readers some notion of who is being anonymously quoted - and why. Sources very close to the ex-editor of this paper couldn't be happier about that. Recondite stuff? Not at all. Here is a horror story. </p> <p>You surely remember some of it: the randy president of the United States, the plump young intern, sex in the Oval Office, the mystery of the semen-stained dress. You probably won't, though, have been following what happened much later - including the trial of one of Judge Kenneth Starr's permutating spokesmen, Charles Bakaly, for lying to a judge. (Was he or wasn't he the source of a New York Times story? Verdict awaited). </p> <p>The two stories are linked, of course: both feature America's one-man unofficial press complaints commission, Steven Brill, editor of the modestly titled magazine he calls Brill's Content. Brill began snapping away at the Monica Lewinsky saga two years ago in a memorably long and contentious article called Pressgate. And this watchdog is still gnawing the same, battered bone. </p> <p>Brill's thesis is simple and damning. There seemed to be many sources through the White House travails of 1998 and 1999 as newspaper reporters and TV political commentators and magazine investigators and internet gossipers and talk show hosts chased each others' tales through the thickets of scandal. It was such a huge thing; it was so infinitely exciting that the world media looked on agog. Yet, when you comb through the first six months of these pulsations, there were really only three people making the news. </p> <p>One was Linda Tripp, the \"friend\" of Monica who wanted to write a book and be famous. Another was Lucianne Goldberg, the literary agent and renowned Clinton loather, who wanted to sell that book for cash. And the third, more collective source, was the office of the \"independent prosecutor\", Ken Starr, which had spent millions in fruitless pursuit of the president and needed a break, any break, like desert rats need an ice-cold lager. Put that trio together and you've more or less run out of other sources - save for a little toing and froing with the lawyers for Paula Jones, who had their own fish to fry. </p> <p>Consider, then, a few of the more memorable Monica moments. How (around mid-October 1997) did it all start? When the Jones legal team began getting anonymous telephone calls from a woman who told them that Tripp and Lewinsky would be worth subpoenas. Who made those calls? Tripp herself. Did Lucianne encourage Linda? \"Not exactly, but, hell, I guess you could say so.\" The subpoenas were issued. Thereafter, one of the pair called the Starr team to alert them to Lewinsky's existence - and once that had happened, the story (in news reporting terms) became \"real\". Newsweek began to be interested. The show was on the road. </p> <p>What about all the love letters and tapes that Lewinsky allegedly had sent by courier to Clinton's office after the affair was over, times and deliveries documented and leaked? Lucianne's brother's family owns the courier firm. Tripp and Goldberg (un-amazingly enough) told Monica which company to use. </p> <p>That stained blue dress, may be (nudge, nudge) uncleaned and still in existence: \"Monica's Love Dress\", according to the New York Daily News. Matt Drudge, internet gossip, breaks the tale on the net. There's a \"potential DNA trail\" and ABC television is soon following it. Is this Tripp stirring the Drudge sludge? No: Goldberg is the source again - though, she tells Brill, she's not sure that Monica told Linda she'd \"saved\" it, just that it was stained. \"I might have added the part about it being saved.\" It does not stop the story echoing round the globe. (We only learn much later that the dress had been dry-cleaned anyway.) </p> <p>And then... the White House employee (perhaps a butler, perhaps a secret service agent) who supposedly \"walked in\" on the guilty couple. Enter a Washington lawyer, Joseph DiGenova, and his lawyer wife, Victoria. Joe hears Vicki on the phone talking to an old White House chum (unspecified) who says that he/or she's talked to another co-worker who saw Bill and Monica \"in a compromising position\". The co-worker has asked the chum to ask Victoria whether she might do the legal honours if he/she goes to Kenneth Starr (though, unbeknown to Joe, nobody pursues anything). </p> <p>DiGenova mentions this to a reporter from the Dallas Morning News, which gets out the big headline type. A one-source story, Brill remarks, from a fifth-hand source - because \"DiGenova (1) heard his wife (2) talking to a friend (3) of someone (4) who had talked to someone (5) who said they'd seen Lewinsky with Clinton.\" By the time the Associated Press had picked it up from Dallas and CNN was running with it, fifth-hand was seventh-hand. </p> <p>I could go on (and Brill does, with a beady eye for detail): but the essential case is already made. The president and the intern were horrendously foolish - and Bill Clinton's reputation, unlike Monica's dress, is stained for ever. There was a story in there somewhere. But, crucial caveat, most of the stories around the story were the confections of three eager people (Linda, Lucianne and Ken) with axes to grind. </p> <p>Back to modern times, Charles Bakaly and the charges of lying. As the impeachment proceedings reached fever pitch in January 1999, the New York Times reported \"several associates\" of Judge Starr as saying that the independent counsel's office had concluded that Mr Clinton could be indicted while a sitting president. Was Bakaly one - or all - of those associates? He denied it; then, in evidence, admitted handing over an indictment memo to the Times. </p> <p>Well, we'll see. . . but we don't, I think, need to wait for a conclusion. The Lewinsky affair, in its lathering falsities, was the shaming of modern journalism. So few sources, so much blather. And because news is constant now - from a word on the net or the agency wires to speculation as fact to a balloon of talk show discussion - the machine feeds the frenzy. What everybody's saying becomes obviously true - because everybody's saying it. Even if the first and only person to say it was Lucianne of the stained/saved dress. </p> <p>The press, says Alastair Campbell bitterly, just make up stories. No they don't: but they do find it increasingly hard to know what's real and what's phoney in the constant reprocessing from sheet to sheet and medium to medium - what's source for the goose and sauce for a gander. May Heaven bless Mr Rusbridger and his prospective code. May the reader be better informed. The miasma of Monica, though, had too little to do with the reader. That was journalists baffling each other with their mystic, deluding jargon. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:peter.preston@theguardian.com\">peter.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "No one ever accused Jesse Timmendequas, a paedophile on death row, of being an over-achiever, but his crimes are responsible for one of the most emotional debates in the United States. <p>The former labourer, 39, might be low on name recognition, but that of his victim is known even to those who have no knowledge of her abruptly curtailed life.</p> <p>Megan Kanka was seven years old when Timmendequas, a New Jersey neighbour living with two other paedophiles, abducted, raped and strangled her in 1994.</p> <p>The girl's parents believed that she might still be alive had they known he was living nearby and set about gathering 430,000 signatures to press for a change in the law.</p> <p>New Jersey responded quickly, and in 1996 Congress and President Bill Clinton obliged with the measure known as Megan's law: each state had to release \"relevant\" information about child molesters and violent sexual offenders to the public.</p> <p>It was left to each of the 50 states to decide how access to the information was provided. Civil libertarians argue that the law breaches the privacy of ex-offenders and makes them a target for retribution.</p> <p>\"People who have been convicted of crimes, who have served their sentences, should not be the subject of continuing punishment,\" said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).</p> <p>Some states make the information about the nation's 324,000 registered sex offenders available at local police stations, while in others people have to write requesting details or call a toll-free telephone number. Twenty-one states, most of them in the south and the mid-west, post details on the internet. But at least 10% of the information, which is supplied by the offenders, is thought to be incorrect.</p> <p>When the law was finally en forced two years ago in New Jersey after a series of legal challenges, the names and photographs of men whose details were meant to have been confined to the neighbourhood - an area which was not defined - turned up in the local media. Then a school counsellor who had never been accused of sex crimes was identified as an offender in handbills distributed close to his home.</p> <p>Many people were upset when it became clear that they would not find out about every sex offender but only those who were living nearest to them and were considered the most dangerous.</p> <p>Later, five bullets were fired through the sitting room window of a home above that of a man who had been to prison for raping teenagers.</p> <p>Elsewhere, a man hanged himself from a tree in Santa Rosa, California, after police warned his neighbours that he was a convicted child molester; another shot himself after officers in Seal Cove, Maine, distributed handbills saying he had confessed to having sex with a boy six years previously; an offender's car was fire-bombed in Los Angeles after he appeared on an internet list; and two men beat a convicted sex offender with a baseball bat in North Fort Myers, Florida, and threatened to kill him if he went near children in the neighbourhood.</p> <p>New Mexico was the last state to adopt Megan's law. \"This is mean-spirited voyeurism, and that's its only effect,\" said Denise Clegg, acting executive director of the state's ACLU. \"If there was a good case we would definitely challenge it.\"</p> <p>Even in New Jersey the operation of Megan's law is by no means settled, and it has been suspended twice under legal challenge in the past seven months. Now that it is back in use, prosecutors say they cannot act against those who misuse information about sex offenders because of a court judgment limiting the scope of warnings to those who receive it.</p> <p>Another, more strident measure against sex offenders that has received less attention is Stephanie's law, named after a 19-year-old killed in 1994 and adopted in various forms by at least 13 states. This law, born in Kansas, allows for the detention in mental institutions of those considered likely to offend again after their release from jail. In Illinois, for instance, more than 100 have been incarcerated in institutions in the past two years and none has been released.</p> <p>Amitai Etzioni, a professor at George Washington University and founder of the Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics, said that neither law worked well. Megan's law deprived sex offenders of privacy without improving the safety of children unless adults were with them at all times. Stephanie's law did improve safety but removed the rights of released prisoners.</p> <p>\"Confine child molesters in special, guarded, child-free communities,\" he said. \"As a means of separating molesters from children, this would be more effective than Megan's law but less intrusive and costly than Stephanie's law.</p> <p>\"While some critics have compared this proposal to leper colonies, the communal custody approach is better than any of the alternatives.\"</p>"
