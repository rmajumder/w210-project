  "At least the members of the Scottish parliament got the important legislation out of the way early. Last year, on the historic first day of sitting, the newly elected members of the newly devolved institution agreed on the following: that they should all receive a bronze commemorative medal to mark their role in history. Exhausted by the legislative process, they then took a two-month holiday. Though not before deciding it would be a fine idea to commission a \u00a3200m building in which to conduct their future activities. <p> Tomorrow, when they start their second year in business, the members of the Scottish parliament will have a somewhat more rigorous agenda. Over the summer, the political news has made alarming reading for them. Take these headlines from the Daily Record, Scotland's biggest-selling daily paper, last Wednesday: \"Beleaguered ministers careers take turn for the worse exam chaos spreads waiting lists soar union chiefs threaten autumn of discontent\".</p> <p> Meanwhile, Alex Salmond , the leader of the SNP, the official opposition party, has been spending the summer telling everyone who will listen that, technically, the Scottish economy is about to enter recession: receipts are below expenditure, imports above exports, with economic growth too low to mop up the difference. As birthday messages to mark the second year of devolved government go, the Scottish parliament could hardly have chosen a less complimentary one: much of the superficial evidence suggests this is a country which cannot rule itself.</p> <p> In truth, walking round the streets last week, Scotland does not look on the verge of economic collapse. Edinburgh in particular, with its endless new bars and restaurants and a housing market approaching London levels of ludicrousness, looks in rude economic health. In Glasgow, too, the buoyant central business district is full of busy corporations such as Scottish Power, Scottish Widows and Scottish Gas, whose nomenclature identifies them firmly with the sort of self-confident nationalism which would be reckoned business suicide south of the border. And, since everyone living outside the central belt is always quick to point out that Glasgow and Edinburgh are not the real Scotland, it seems advisable to report that business-wise things are pretty cheery elsewhere too.</p> <p> \"Shell has just announced a big increase in investment up here,\" says Amanda Harvie, of the Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce. \"Without wishing to suggest we are approaching boom times, I'd say there was overall an upturn in confidence at the sharp end. That is not to pretend there are not real challenges ahead.\"</p> <p> As its defenders would point out, it is the challenges that the Scottish parliament has been set up to address. Success can get on by its own, it is failure that needs sorting out by government. And - impending recession or not - Scotland has enormous challenges beyond an apparent inability to mark examination papers properly. Bad health, bad housing, bad diet and drug abuse are endemic. It is a nation, too, identified by division: north/south east/west Lowland/Highland rural/urban. Many of the divisions are even enshrined constitutionally: this is a country which still legislates to ensure Catholics and Protestants are educated separately.</p> <p> And it doesn't seem as if its globally expansive corporations are keen to help. As Stagecoach, Scottish Media and Scottish Power colonise the corporate world with a voracity to match their empire building forebears, they seem to have all but forgotten the local community from which they draw their wealth and expertise. In the past, Scottish business success was characterised by huge public projects (Andrew Carnegie was the typical Scottish philanthropist). Now success is marked by the size of directors' remuneration. Tellingly, the lottery-funded Museum of Scotland which has just opened to great acclaim in Edinburgh, is the only grand cultural building to be built in this grandest cultural city in the last century. Unless you count Murrayfield.</p> <p> Still, in case it may have forgotten the many challenges it faces, the Scottish parliament can always rely on its media to remind it. In an over-crowded newspaper market, Scottish papers seem to have decided that bad news sells. For his own political reasons, Andrew Neil has ensured his Scotsman keeps its teeth never far from the jugular. Even the traditionally Labour-supporting Daily Record has administered almost daily assaults on Donald Dewar and his team since the moment they took office. The failures of the examination system or fears of impending recession are given far greater prominence than the revelation that 29 new schools are being built in Glasgow alone. And always - with every piece of bad news - the new parliament is held accountable.</p> <p> \"There is a real schizophrenia in this country,\" says Frank McAveety MSP, the deputy minister for local government. \"The Scottish press corps lobbied harder than anyone for a devolved parliament, now they've got it, they're queuing up to give it a good kicking.\"</p> <p> For many observers of the Scottish scene - Billy Connolly for instance - there is nothing new in this symptom of a split national personality. In the new Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow's Exchange Square, it is there for all to see. Housed in a glorious legacy from the city's mercantile past, the gallery is full, not of the art of a self-confident, newly semi-independent country, but of gloom and pessimism. Albeit producing fascinating, visually arresting work, young Scottish artists seem obsessed with national shortcomings, failure and self-loathing. In their view everything appears to be wrong with Scotland, from its housing to its way with sex. The misanthropic whole is summed up by Ron O'Donnell's brilliant painting featuring a man bedecked in tartan, sitting in a room decorated with the memorabilia of plastic patriotism. He is slumped in an armchair, can in hand, watching the big match on television. Instead of a head he has a football. The painting is called The Scotsman.</p> <p> \"I think that painting's got it right: football really is an important metaphor for Scottish life, not least because we are so obsessed with it,\" says Sandy Ross, managing director of Scottish Television. \"For instance, you can't ignore the effect the 1978 World Cup had on the collective psyche. We went there saying we could beat the world and we were humiliated as only we Scots can be. I reckon Andrew Marr was right when he said this sense of 'we're crap and we know we are' which resulted from that campaign completely destroyed any chance of devolution the last time it was on the cards in 1979. We simply thought we weren't up to it.\"</p> <p> And if it isn't football, it's Thatcher. The 80s were a bleak time for Scotland, battered by recession, steam-rollered by brutalist economic theories, then spat on as the laboratory of the poll tax. For many in Scotland, it was easy to point the finger for failings. Though to be fair, it is not just paranoia: the English really do appear to have little concern for what goes on over the garden wall.</p> <p> \"Since I came to Scotland 10 years ago,\" says Gavin Stamp, senior lecturer at the McIntosh School of Architecture in Glasgow, \"I've become much more aware of English indifference to Scotland. I have friends who proudly tell me they have never visited Scotland in a way they would be ashamed to admit if they had never been to Paris.\"</p> <p> However justified, loathing of English control over a land for which there was minimal interest became endemic the manner in which the Scottish Office doled out the money in an unaccountable fashion from Westminster was identified as the root cause of every evil visited on the country.</p> <p> \"The country became irresponsible, plagued by a moaning, defeatist culture,\" says Andrew Jaspan, editor of the Herald on Sunday newspaper. \"Every problem was blamed on London.\"</p> <p> Blame: an important word in the Scottish vocabulary.</p> <p> \"Oh yes, we're always looking for someone to blame,\" says Sandy Ross. \"The New Labour honeymoon was far shorter up here. We were already suspicious that Blair would desert us long before he was even elected.\"</p> <p> For the Scottish politicians who arrived after devolution in 1999, getting to grips with blame is part of the new job description.</p> <p> \"The Thatcher years distorted politics in Scotland,\" says Frank McAveety. \"It made it easy. We could all agree we hated her and she was to blame for everything. Now that's all over, there is a much more difficult job: deciding what we stand for and whether we can do it.\"</p> <p> Not that there is a general faith abroad that the parliament is the body to sort much out at all. It is hard to find anyone - unless they are employed by Holyrood - who has a kind word to say about the new Scottish political institutions. If there is any feeling at all for the parliament on the streets, it is the one neatly summarised by Billy Connolly who calls it a \"wee pretendy parliament\". Yet for some observers, the very fact Scotland at last has a parliament to sneer at is a major step forward.</p> <p> \"We may have a mess now with all this summer's cock-ups,\" says Andrew Jaspan, \"but at least it's Scotland's mess. For years it's been easy to say it's someone else's fault. Now people have to face up to it. And I think that's brilliant.\"</p> <p> Jaspan points to the debate about Section 28 as a perfect example of what he calls a \"growing-up process\" instigated by the arrival of the parliament. The debate was an ugly, divisive one. The bus billionaire Brian Souter bankrolled a campaign against its abolition which quickly ran out of control. Posters suggested that if Section 28 was removed from the statute books, buggery would become part of the syllabus. With the willing endorsement of the Catholic church and parts of the Church of Scotland, the anti-abolitionists whipped up a virulently homophobic fervour.</p> <p> \"A lot of people said that the debate over Section 28 was a disaster,\" says Jaspan, \"but I reckon it was probably the best debate Scotland's had for years. It challenged a lot of people who assumed we were a tolerant, liberal society to really look at themselves and defend the issues.\"</p> <p> Gordon Macdougall, the political editor of Scottish Television, agrees.</p> <p> \"A lot of my English friends told me that the Section 28 business showed what a backward, ugly nation we really were,\" he says. \"But at the end of it, Section 28 has been abolished up here and it is still on the statute books down south.\"</p> <p> For all its symbolic importance, however, Section 28 was still, in essence, an intellectual issue. When it comes to the nitty-gritty of finance, health, housing and education, the parliament does not yet appear to have proved that it can run things better than Westminster.</p> <p> \"A year is too soon to tell,\" says Frank McAveety. \"But I believe we are putting in place legislation which, in the long run, will change Scotland for the better. I think people had such high hopes of immediate change, there is inevitably a sense of anti-climax, but legislation takes time. I'm relaxed about the slagging off. It is a legitimate job of the press to examine. And you could say it's that good for the first time they really have something to examine.\"</p> <p> It would help, some observers feel, if the parliament could get its own PR right. Not just stopping blunders such as its self-important first day in office, but being much more active in explaining to voters just what it is up to. But in the meantime, for the first time in Scotland's parliamentary history, the boys and girls returning to Holyrood for the new term tomorrow have to face up to this issue: a summer of relentless bad news has got to be resolved not at 400 miles distance, but by them, on their fellow citizens' doorstep.</p> <p> \"It is the big question: can the Scots govern themselves? and we shall have to wait for the answer,\" says Gavin Stamp. \"Mind you, population of less than five million, edge of Europe, crap climate: the Norwegians seem to manage it.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the US last week a distraught family told the media how their three-year-old girl was taken into care. \"They dragged her out of the room kicking and screaming,\" said her mother. \"She was terrified.\" The toddler in question, Anamarie Martinez-Regino, weighs eight and a half stone. She is three times as heavy as an average American three-year-old and, according to the doctors involved, her condition is \"life-threatening\". </p> <p>Childhood obesity is a severe problem in the US. The latest data shows that more than one-fifth of US children are overweight, and about one in 10 obese. You might think this predictable in the land that invented doublechocolatechocolatechip ice-cream. But look around you: British kids, too, are getting fatter. </p> <p>Last year, a study in the British Medical Journal found that nearly 16% of two-year-olds were overweight and 6% were obese, while more than 20% of four-year-olds were overweight and 7.6% obese. </p> <p>This hasn't always been the case: between 1972 and 1994, English boys grew 10% fatter, and girls 5%; while in Scotland boys got 13% fatter and girls 16%. </p> <p>Of course, there's nothing wrong with a chubby child. But a heavily overweight one is a different matter. Obesity in children can cause health problems: an increased risk of disease, problems moving around, a greater risk of cardiovascular difficulties and of abnormalities in glucose metabolism (diabetes, for instance). </p> <p>This doesn't even touch on the psychological damage a fat child can suffer. \"Every minute of every day friends, teachers, family, TV and magazines are telling them they're worthless,\" says Dr Paul Gateley, senior lecturer in exercise physiology and health at Leeds Metropolitan University. </p> <p>So what should you do if your child is worryingly fat? Should you tackle the issue and risk undermining their self-esteem, or sit tight and hope it will sort itself out? </p> <p>\"Children grow at different rates,\" Gateley says. \"They often lay down fat in preparation for growth spurts.\" </p> <p>\"The first thing you should do if you're worrying,\" says Dr Susan Jebb, head of nutrition and health at the Medical Research Council's nutrition centre in Cambridge, \"is compare your child with others of the same age. If yours is significantly fatter (say one of the fattest three), then you may have cause for concern.\" Then you should see your GP. \"They'll compare your child's size to 'normal' growth charts, and establish whether there is genuinely a problem.\" </p> <p>But the chances are nobody will be able to tell you exactly why your child is fat. Parents will often put a child's (and their own) weight problem down to \"unlucky genes\". They'll claim that their little one eats normally, and yet still gains weight. Genes certainly could play a part in deciding fatness: numerous studies have clearly shown this. But the findings are far from specific. \"So far more than 200 genes have been identified that have some association with obesity,\" Jebb says. \"But we really know very little about the genes themselves.\" </p> <p>What we do know is that it's rare for genes alone to cause a child to balloon. Only five children worldwide have been identified in whom there is a specific defect in the \"ob gene\". This single defect can lead to gross obesity from an early age (and could well be the cause of Anamarie's weight gain). </p> <p>But with most fat children, the diagnosis is more straightforward. \"If your energy intake exceeds your energy needs,\" Jebb says, \"you'll gain weight.\" Not surprisingly, research has shown a marked similarity between the eating habits of parents and their children. Wolfing a Wispa while trying to get your kids to eat broccoli, is not the best strategy. \"You have to create the right environment for healthy eating,\" says Gateley, \"one in which your children eat three good meals a day, and don't snack.\" </p> <p>What you mustn't do, though, is deny your child food. \"The concept of dieting for children is completely inappropriate except in the most extreme cases,\" says Jebb. Instead, the trick is to make changes without your child realising. \"Forget to fill up the sweet drawer,\" suggests Gateley, \"and fill up the fruit bowl instead.\" </p> <p>You also have to get your child to exercise. It's just as important as eating right and it's something most British children don't get anywhere near enough of. Less than 5% now walk or cycle to school compared with more than 80% 20 years ago. Most spend their leisure hours slumped in front of the TV or computer screen. One US study showed a 2% increase in child obesity for each extra hour of telly watched. </p> <p>Setting a good example works here, too. A study of children aged four to seven found that the ones with active parents were seven times more energetic than their lazy-parented friends. \"Kids need to associate activity with fun,\" says Gateley. \"Obesity doesn't develop overnight,\" says Jebb, \"and you can't treat it overnight either.\" Indeed, you shouldn't even be thinking in terms of weight loss for your child. \"All you have to do is stop them gaining any more weight.\"</p>",
  "<p>The sponsorship opportunities being bandied around at this year's Olympics make Anthea and Grant's recent efforts look like child's play. From Coca-Cola to Kodak, Time to Telstra, everyone seems to want a piece of the sporting action.</p> <p>The main sponsors of the event - the so-called \"TOP\", or The Olympic Partnership sponsors - are estimated to have paid upwards of $40 million. For that the sponsors, which include McDonald's, Coca-Cola, IBM and Visa, get the global exclusive on advertising Olympic tie-ins for their sector, and the right to a physical presence at the Games.</p> <p>Of course, it does not include the cost of the actual advertising to be done throughout the world on television, print, posters and the web, which will doubtless run to many, many more millions.</p> <p>So is it worth it? McDonald's seems to think so. It has just signed up for the 2002 Salt Lake Ciy Olympics and the 2004 Athens Summer Games at a reported cost of $55 million.</p> <p>But IBM has dropped out of TOP, and the organisers of the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics are said to be having trouble finding sponsors because of the bribery scandal surrounding the selection of Salt Lake City for the 2000 Games.</p> <p>The other problem is that not everyone is prepared to pay for the benefit of association with the Games. This year the International Olympic Committee has tried to regain some control over advertising relating to the Games after a Nike campaign that ran during the 1996 Olympics. The campaign, which featured lines such as, \"You don't win silver; you lose gold,\" was criticised as being antithetical to the spirit of the games.</p> <p>The criticism gave rise to the term \"ambush marketing\", a practice the IOC is keen to stamp out. The committee drew up a code of practice for advertisers. But recent campaigns from Qantas and the National Australia Bank, another non-sponsor that has run ads linking itself to the Olympics, have proved the code to be pretty ineffectual.</p>",
  "It is the perfect tipple for the overheated beer drinker seeking more than just liquid refreshment - a superchilled lager served with a frozen head. <p>Thanks to a casual suggestion by a PhD student on placement, brewers Bass have developed the first sub-zero draught lager, which comes topped with an inch of ice crystals. And while beer purists may shiver at the prospect, the brewery is confident it will be able to tempt British pub-goers away from their traditional preference for warm ale. </p> <p>Much of the pleasure from a pint of Arc lager may be in the pouring. Before enjoying a drink of the chilly lager top, drinkers are treated to a serving display worthy of a cocktail waiter. </p> <p>The revolutionary process begins with the empty pint glass being placed on a specially designed rotating font and sprayed with a blast of chilled water. </p> <p>The lager is served at a temperature of -2C (28F), and stored at high pressure to keep it from freezing solid. When the drink is poured from the pump the pressure is released and a blast of ultrasonic waves triggers the formation of ice crystals around the beer's gas bubbles. </p> <p>To date Arc has been launched only in two pubs, in north London and Watford, but the brewery claims the beer gained the highest approval rating of any of its products in taste tests. </p> <p>\"We knew we had something revolutionary when the lager scored exceptionally well in market research - 75% of participants said they would definitely buy this product,\" said David Griffiths, the new product development manager at Bass. </p> <p>But not all beer-lovers are convinced. Iain Loe, research manager at the Campaign for Real Ale, believes drinkers will soon tire of what he calls a marketing gimmick. </p> <p>\"At the temperatures at which they are talking of serving it you won't be able to taste anything,\" he says. \"Beers, be they ales or lagers, should be served cool, but never iced. Certainly not in a way where they could almost be served on a stick.\" </p> <p>Arc lager will be launched nationwide later in the autumn. </p> <p>In the meantime, drinkers will have to content themselves with adding their own ice cubes.</p>",
  "A Ghanaian convicted cocaine importer has launched a high court challenge to the decision to deport him to his home country, claiming it would violate his right to family life under the European convention on human rights. <p>Ernest Doku, who was granted parole in June after serving four and a half years of a 12-year sentence, argues that the move would breach his human rights by separating him from his British wife and son, and from his two British daughters from an earlier relationship. </p> <p>Yesterday his counsel, Cherie Booth QC, failed to persuade a high court judge to release Doku on bail pending his application for judicial review early next month. His case is expected to be one of the first challenges to come to court after the Human Rights Act comes into force on October 2, incorporating the European convention into English law. </p> <p>Following a trial at Isleworth crown court, west London, in December 1995, Doku was convicted of being knowingly concerned in the importation of five kilograms of cocaine. He was jailed for 12 years and his deportation was recommended. </p> <p>He was granted parole in June but he continues to be held at the Verne prison, Portland, Dorset, while the papers for his deportation are being processed. </p> <p>For about 10 years before he came to the UK in 1976, Doku, 64, worked as a barrister for the Ghanaian ministry of justice. He married his British wife, Suzie, who lives in Wembley, north London, three years after arriving in the UK. Their son, Ernest, is at university. His daughters are in their 20s. </p> <p>Doku, who has a masters degree in social sciences and international relations, established a successful business exporting commodities and building materials to Ghana. He was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK in 1983. </p> <p>Ms Booth told Mr Justice Jackson that Doku had been a model prisoner, and had successfully completed a programme that helps prisoners develop a sense of self-respect and responsibility. He had since helped other prisoners complete the programme. </p> <p>But the judge refused him bail, saying there was a risk of absconding, particularly if the decision in a similar case to be heard shortly before his own went against him. </p> <p>The courts are bracing themselves for a raft of claims under the Human Rights Act, with immigration and deportation predicted to be a fertile area. </p> <p>Under the convention, the right to family life is not absolute. The state may legiti mately interfere with it for a number of reasons, including \"for the prevention of disorder or crime\". But the state must not go further than is necessary to achieve that aim. </p> <p>The European court of human rights in Strasbourg held in one case that there was no violation where the applicant brought his deportation on himself by breaching immigration controls.</p>",
  "It is a picture postcard example of Cornwall's appeal to visitors: a small town of steep winding streets, bristling with signs of its medieval, Tudor and Victorian past. <p>Fowey, with a population just over 2,100, overlooks a beautiful estuary where sailing boats nestle under wooded hills and the autumn regatta is a popular occasion. It hosts an annual festival in honour of the area's most famous author, Daphne Du Maurier.</p> <p>Yet according to the local MP, Colin Breed, 30% of the homes in Fowey are second homes. \"In January and February at the weekend the whole place is quite decimated.\"</p> <p>Mr Breed, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on agriculture and rural affairs, stoked the debate on second homes yesterday when he launched a discussion document calling for an end to 50% council tax rebates on them and urging that councils be able to force people buying houses they were not going to live in the whole time to ask for special planning permission.</p> <p>The document said the \"increased immigration of wealthy and more affluent people\" had forced house prices up and cut the amount of affordable housing to local people. Lembit Opik, the Lib Dem MP for Montgomeryshire, added: \"We don't want the countryside to become a dormitory for the weekend.\"</p> <p>The party is considering a new form of \"tied housing\" where, like the farmworkers' cottages of old, rural houses are set aside for teachers or other key workers who otherwise could not afford to move to desirable areas.</p> <p>Estate agents in Fowey yesterday were not sure that restrictions were necessary yet. Chris Parsons, a partner in May, Whetter and Grose, said: \"There is a hard core of local people who would like to stay in town and buy a house and cannot afford the property prices we now have here.</p> <p>\"But there is so little employment locally that it is likely they would have to go out of the county anyway.\" He did not think the proportion of second homes had changed significantly for years.</p> <p>\"I suppose if we reached the point where 40-50 % were holiday homes, we might need to consider restrictions.\"</p> <p>A three-bedroom property on the waterfront could now fetch \u00a3300,000 or more, and 70% of his buyers were from the home counties. But they were not generally buying properties previously occupied by locals.</p> <p>Estate agent Max Harrower, of Fowey River, also denied things had changed much in recent years. \"A lot of people coming here are providing income for people locally. People come back here and say it has not been spoilt commercially. It is a natural place for some to come down and spend a few weeks a year and perhaps do a bit of holiday letting.\"</p> <p>Restormel district council disputed Mr Breed's figure, and said the true percentage of holiday homes in Fowey was nearer 15%.</p> <p>Some fashionable spots on Cornwall's north coast have an even higher proportion of second homes. As many as 70% of properties in Treyarnon Bay, near Padstow, may be holiday homes, says John Weller, prospective Tory parliamentary candidate for north Cornwall, and leader of Restormel district council.</p> <p>English councils, like those in Wales, should have the discretion to charge full council tax, he said. \"No one who is well enough off to come to live in such a beautiful place would not want it to regenerate itself.\"</p> <p>Such a change could bring Cornwall county council an extra \u00a35m for education and social services. If the government did not introduce new powers in the expected rural white paper, Tories in the west country would want it in their party manifesto for the next general election, he said. \"It is not a party political thing. Most people find it realistic.\"</p> <p>There are thought to be about 250,000 second homes in England and Wales. Ministers have been hinting at action, but Michael Meacher, the environment minister, who owns a second home in Gloucestershire, was accused last year of threatening to start a \"class war\" when he suggested that they should be banned in some areas.</p>",

Though to be fair, it is not just paranoia: the English really do appear to have little concern for what goes on over the garden wall. </p> <p>\"Since I came to Scotland 10 years ago,\" says Gavin Stamp, senior lecturer at the McIntosh School of Architecture in Glasgow, \"I've become much more aware of English indifference to Scotland. I have friends who proudly tell me they have never visited Scotland in a way they would be ashamed to admit if they had never been to Paris.\" </p> <p>However justified, loathing of English control over a land for which there was minimal interest became endemic; the manner in which the Scottish Office doled out the money in an unaccountable fashion from Westminster was identified as the root cause of every evil visited on the country. </p> <p>\"The country became irresponsible, plagued by a moaning, defeatist culture,\" says Andrew Jaspan, editor of the Herald on Sunday newspaper. \"Every problem was blamed on London.\" </p> <p>Blame: an important word in the Scottish vocabulary. </p> <p>\"Oh yes, we're always looking for someone to blame,\" says Sandy Ross. \"The New Labour honeymoon was far shorter up here. We were already suspicious that Blair would desert us long before he was even elected.\" </p> <p>For the Scottish politicians who arrived after devolution in 1999, getting to grips with blame is part of the new job description. </p> <p>\"The Thatcher years distorted politics in Scotland,\" says Frank McAveety. \"It made it easy. We could all agree we hated her and she was to blame for everything. Now that's all over, there is a much more difficult job: deciding what we stand for and whether we can do it.\" </p> <p>Not that there is a general faith abroad that the parliament is the body to sort much out at all. It is hard to find anyone - unless they are employed by Holyrood - who has a kind word to say about the new Scottish political institutions. If there is any feeling at all for the parliament on the streets, it is the one neatly summarised by Billy Connolly who calls it a \"wee pretendy parliament\". Yet for some observers, the very fact Scotland at last has a parliament to sneer at is a major step forward. </p> <p>\"We may have a mess now with all this summer's cock-ups,\" says Andrew Jaspan, \"but at least it's Scotland's mess. For years it's been easy to say it's someone else's fault. Now people have to face up to it. And I think that's brilliant.\" </p> <p>Jaspan points to the debate about Section 28 as a perfect example of what he calls a \"growing-up process\" instigated by the arrival of the parliament. The debate was an ugly, divisive one. The bus billionaire Brian Souter bankrolled a campaign against its abolition which quickly ran out of control. Posters suggested that if Section 28 was removed from the statute books, buggery would become part of the syllabus. With the willing endorsement of the Catholic church and parts of the Church of Scotland, the anti-abolitionists whipped up a virulently homophobic fervour. </p> <p>\"A lot of people said that the debate over Section 28 was a disaster,\" says Jaspan, \"but I reckon it was probably the best debate Scotland's had for years. It challenged a lot of people who assumed we were a tolerant, liberal society to really look at themselves and defend the issues.\" </p> <p>Gordon Macdougall, the political editor of Scottish Television, agrees. </p> <p>\"A lot of my English friends told me that the Section 28 business showed what a backward, ugly nation we really were,\" he says. \"But at the end of it, Section 28 has been abolished up here and it is still on the statute books down south.\" </p> <p>For all its symbolic importance, however, Section 28 was still, in essence, an intellectual issue. When it comes to the nitty-gritty of finance, health, housing and education, the parliament does not yet appear to have proved that it can run things better than Westminster. </p> <p>\"A year is too soon to tell,\" says Frank McAveety. \"But I believe we are putting in place legislation which, in the long run, will change Scotland for the better. I think people had such high hopes of immediate change, there is inevitably a sense of anti-climax, but legislation takes time. I'm relaxed about the slagging off. It is a legitimate job of the press to examine. And you could say it's that good for the first time they really have something to examine.\" </p> <p>It would help, some observers feel, if the parliament could get its own PR right. Not just stopping blunders such as its self-important first day in office, but being much more active in explaining to voters just what it is up to. But in the meantime, for the first time in Scotland's parliamentary history, the boys and girls returning to Holyrood for the new term tomorrow have to face up to this issue: a summer of relentless bad news has got to be resolved not at 400 miles distance, but by them, on their fellow citizens' doorstep. </p> <p>\"It is the big question: can the Scots govern themselves? and we shall have to wait for the answer,\" says Gavin Stamp. \"Mind you, population of less than five million, edge of Europe, crap climate: the Norwegians seem to manage it.\"</p>"
