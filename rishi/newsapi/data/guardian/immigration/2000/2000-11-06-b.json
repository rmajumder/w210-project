  "<p>Martin O'Neill's Celtic look remorseless. The Irishman has given his team something that this club has craved for years - the wit and durability to visit grounds such as Kilmarnock's and come away victorious. Jozef Venglos and John Barnes, O'Neill's predecessors, foundered here, but no one in green and white now can talk of the graveyard that is Ayrshire. </p> <p>If Celtic do win the championship this season it will arrive on such feats as this thorough job. Kilmarnock, currently third, have been nobody's fools. Celtic, though, played the unwelcome and uncompromising visitor, eking out chances. On top of this, O'Neill is amassing impressive statistics. This was Celtic's 14th unbeaten league match, of which they have won 12. </p> <p>Celtic should have won this more comfortably had Henrik Larsson, their talismanic Swede, not indulged himself ludicrously. Larsson's skills can be thrilling, but in the 66th minute, with his side guarding their lead, he rounded Gordon Marshall before opting to toy with the empty net. Instead of scoring, Larsson became a circus act. A posse of defenders enveloped him before punting the ball clear. </p> <p>\"In 99 cases out of 100 you would put money on Larsson to score that,\" said O'Neill later. \"But we won, so I'll forgive him.\" </p> <p>Scotland remains an unwelcoming place to Chris Sutton. Scarcely had the Englishman stepped foot north of the border and a red card was received with a flurry of yellows soon following. Yesterday it took around 50 seconds to elapse before the referee Willie Young, a man who wears his contempt with pride, summoned Sutton to book him. </p> <p>The striker may be tempted by now to claim racism in these parts - in truth the Scots cannot convincingly claim that anglophobia does not exist. Yet the studs that Sutton planted into Ian Durrant's ankles looked painful enough to warrant his reprimand. The moment caught the mood of a physically bruising match. </p> <p>Sutton, though, was instrumental in Celtic's goal after 60 minutes. It was the Englishman's persistence near the touchline and dribble past Gary Hay that preserved momentum. When Didier Agathe's cross was dispatched, taking a big deflection on the way, it evaded everyone, including Larsson and Sutton himself, before Alan Thompson arrived to prod past Marshall. </p> <p>Kilmarnock are blessed with a goalkeeper of eccentric foibles - one moment clutching the ball bravely and cleanly, the next fumbling around with it. Four years ago Marshall was tossed out of Celtic Park and from this performance you could see why - his brilliance is always partial. </p> <p>The way he blocked efforts from Sutton and Stilian Petrov, both from deadly range, was marvellous. Yet Marshall had also flapped badly at Petrov's earlier effort, nearly allowing Larsson to hare in and steal an earlier lead. With Celtic's Jonathan Gould refusing to be upstaged, this match was captivating partly for its entertaining goalkeepers. </p> <p>Kilmarnock can live with this setback. Bobby Williamson's team had youngsters strewn throughout it, though they failed to threaten Celtic enough to warrant a point. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>This is a pivotal week for Manchester United, who must beat Dynamo Kiev at Old Trafford on Wednesday to ensure a continued presence in the Champions League. Should they fail, even the prospect of a Premier League hat-trick would be a poor consolation, and the idea of slumming it in the Uefa Cup is patently unappealing. </p> <p>Understandably, therefore, Sir Alex Ferguson chose to give his leading players not a rest on Saturday but a rehearsal against Dynamo Cov - or rather Coventry City, whose dynamism depends in part on how many AA batteries they can muster at any one time. </p> <p>United won, of course, as they had done in 14 of the previous 16 encounters with Coventry. And they would probably still have won had Ferguson chosen to rotate his team as he had done in winning 3-0 at Leicester City, then the Premiership leaders, three weeks earlier. </p> <p>But having fielded an Extra A XI at Watford in the Worthington Cup, where needless to say United beat the Nationwide leaders 3-0, Ferguson thought that his first team could do with some match practice. \"I could have made changes and rested one or two but I felt they needed a game today,\" he explained. </p> <p>As a result Gordon Strachan's side found themselves facing the strongest opposition Ferguson could muster. This was the definitive United team with the exception of the centre-back positions, where Gary Neville and Wes Brown filled in for Jaap Stam and Ronny Johnsen. </p> <p>Stam is expected to be out until the new year after an Achilles operation but Johnsen, now recovered from an ankle injury, should be back against Kiev. This could see Brown switching to right-back, replacing Phil Neville, and Nicky Butt is set to replace the suspended Paul Scholes in midfield. </p> <p>Without Stam's power and authority United are vulnerable at the back, and on Saturday Coventry eventually exploited a weakness in the air when Gary Breen met Paul Telfer's corner with a strong header which the Peruvian Ysrael Zuniga, standing almost on the goalline, nodded into the net. </p> <p>It was Coventry's misfortune that injuries to Cedric Roussel and John Aloisi deprived them of the combination of aerial strength and ground strategy that might have enabled them to press home this advantage to greater effect. As it was, the introduction of John Eustace just before the hour added sufficient aggression to their football to bring a sweat to United's brow and briefly rile Roy Keane. </p> <p>Coventry are not a bad team. They may lie 17th at present but they are as much of a muchness as most of the mid-table pack. </p> <p>The Moroccan pair Moustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo continue to provide skilful, imaginative touches and the presence in Strachan's attack of the teenaged Jay Bothroyd, a member of the Arsenal team that beat Coventry in last season's FA Youth Cup final, was encouraging for the longer term. </p> <p>Coventry's problem on Saturday was that up to half-time a number of their players appeared to believe that they should not be sharing the same pitch as the champions. After the game the feeling was confirmed by Strachan when he said : \"In the first half we were playing the reputation of Manchester United. Roy Keane only got his first tackle when John Eustace came on.\" </p> <p>That said, the quality of United's opening goal shortly before the half-hour would have commanded respect from more vaunted opponents than Coventry. In a counterattack of bewildering pace and precision Scholes volleyed a long pass out to David Beckham on the right and he sprinted almost to the byline before crossing low for Andrew Cole to turn the ball in first time at the near post. </p> <p>For smoothness of movement and speed of delivery the goal would not have discredited a game of ice hockey. Ferguson was not exaggerating when he declared that \"you won't get many better goals than that this season\". Even one would be a surprise. </p> <p>In contrast United's second goal, 10 minutes later, was all about Beckham's reputation at free-kicks. Paul Williams is Coventry's steadiest defender but needlessly fouled Ryan Giggs within scoring range, exposing his goalkeeper Chris Kirkland to Beckham's powers. </p> <p>Kirkland lined up the defenders and prepared himself for the usual mortar attack over their heads. Instead Beckham's kick surprised him by bouncing tamely through the wall and through the goalkeeper's hands. </p> <p>After Zuniga had scored United tightened up their game and made sure Coventry never smiled again. Late on Dwight Yorke came off the bench to hit a post, enough to have Ferguson reflecting that \"we missed chances and might have regretted it\". </p> <p>This is as nothing, however, to the regrets that will ensue if United's chance in the Champions League is thrown away on Wednesday. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>In recent years, both the British and US economies have grown at a rate far exceeding what was regarded as their rate of growth of productive potential, but with minimal inflation. </p> <p>How is that possible, and can it last? </p> <p>On an orthodox view of the world, such a happy combination of circumstances is not possible because the growth of productive potential is taken as rigid, as if given by God, and inflation is assumed to result from actual output growth in excess of potential output growth. </p> <p>The growth of productive potential is often referred to by economists as the natural rate of growth. The term was coined by the Oxford economist Sir Roy Harrod. </p> <p>What has become apparent from the experience of the last few years, however, particularly in the US, is that there is nothing natural about the natural rate of growth (just as there is nothing natural about the natural rate of unemployment), and that the underlying growth rate of an economy is very responsive to the pressure of demand (or actual output growth). </p> <p>If wage inflation is moderate as the economy expands and unemployment falls, it is possible to sustain high growth rates for long periods without inflation. This is basically because demand creates its own supply and there is no pressure on costs. </p> <p>There are a number of ways in which the growth potential of an economy responds to demand. First, the labour force is extremely elastic. The unemployed are drawn into work, participation rates rise, hours worked increase, part-timers work longer, and countries often draw on migrant labour. </p> <p>Secondly, the growth of labour productivity responds to the growth of output itself. Growth encourages capital accumulation which embodies technical progress; higher output brings scale economies, and the higher the level of output the more adept workers become (learning by doing). </p> <p>Miguel Leon Ledesma and I show in a forthcoming paper* that in all OECD countries in the past 35 years, the underlying growth of economies has expanded by roughly 60% of the increase in the actual growth of output, and by more in countries with higher labour reserves such as Greece and Italy. </p> <p>Two major factors constrain output growth and therefore put a brake on the real growth of living standards; one is inflation and the other is the balance of payments. </p> <p>The conventional wisdom in the US and Britain used to be that the inflation rate would take off if output growth exceeded 2.5%-3% because this would push unemployment below some natural rate leading to a wage-price spiral. </p> <p>Experience has shown that the concept of a natural rate of unemployment is a theoretical construct with no empirical counterpart that can be identified. </p> <p>It all depends on wage behaviour. Not so long ago, the natural rate of unemployment in the US was said to be 8%. When unemployment came down to 7% without accelerating inflation, the natural rate was redefined as 7%. </p> <p>When unemployment came down to 6%, the natural rate was redefined again. Unemployment is now less than 4% and there is still no sign of accelerating inflation. </p> <p>The same story can be told for the UK. What both economies have demonstrated is the simple Keynesian point that sustained demand expansion can lead to sustained higher output growth without infla tion as long as supply responds and costs don't rise. Euroland would do well to take a leaf out of the Anglo-Saxon book and try the same medicine. </p> <p>In the present benign climate of wage negotiations - a far cry from the turbulent years of the 1970s when the golden age of growth without inflation of the 1950s and 1960s was brought to a sticky end - the most likely check on the growth of output will be the balance of payments. </p> <p>In Britain the deficit to GDP ratio is approximately 2%, while in the US it is 4%. Not even the US can go on borrowing indefinitely, although it is not easy to predict when the world's investors will at long last lose confidence in the strength of the almighty dollar. </p> <p>Until then, faster growth than experienced in the 1970s and 1980s, but perhaps not as fast as the 1990s, should be sustainable provided wage demands do not accelerate. </p> <p>The elasticity of productivity to output growth is not something temporary, and reserves of labour still exist to be tapped. </p> <p>\u0095 The Endogeneity of the Natural Rate of Growth, published in the forthcoming Cambridge Journal of Economics. </p> <p><strong>Tony Thirlwall is professor of applied economics at the University of Kent at Canterbury</strong></p>",

  "The Italian government has tried to shore up its constitutional authority by blocking a referendum in Veneto, the region that includes Venice, on greater independence from Rome. <p>The wealthy region proposed a constitution last week which amounted to near secession raising the stakes in the northern battle for power and increasing the fear that Italy may break up. Rome will push its own diluted proposals for devolution through the senate this week.</p> <p>But the president of Veneto, Giancarlo Galan, vowed to press ahead with the referendum. Mr Galan, who belongs to the centre-right coalition which is expected to win next year's general election, wants to keep two-thirds of the tax revenues raised in Veneto and to control health, education, immigration, law and order, and elements of foreign policy.</p> <p>Francesco Rutelli, the centre-left's candidate for prime minister, denounced the plan as a recipe for a Yugoslavian-type disintegration, adding that the diversion of funds would force hospitals in the impoverished south to close.</p> <p>A cabinet meeting decided that a referendum could be called only by the central government. It would interfere with the devolution bill.</p> <p>Veneto's proposal raised the stakes in the north's game of cat and mouse with Rome. The regions of Lombardy and Piedmont, also controlled by the right, want to distance themselves from the south, which they regard as parasitic, corrupt and crime-infested.</p> <p>Agazio Loiero, the regional affairs minister, said blocking the referendum was safer than letting it go ahead and hoping it failed. Some colleagues said the block could give rise to a separatist backlash.</p> <p>It is uncertain that the devolution bill will be passed before the elections, due by April. Opinion polls suggest that the centre-right will thrash the government, which has promised but so far failed to deliver devolution.</p>",
  "The first Jewish vice-presidential candidate in US history ignored the Republican poll lead and observed the Jewish Sabbath with his family. But as soon as the sun went down, Joe Lieberman began one of the most gruelling campaigning days in modern electoral history. <p>Having spent the Saturday in Miami in prayer and relaxation, he went into the political equivalent of hyper-drive: a 6,000-mile tour of seven key states in just over 24 hours, with only the odd hour off for sleep. </p> <p>First stop was a visit to El Pub, a bar in the heart of Miami's Little Havana district. Then, at 8pm, he left for Miami airport and the 230-mile flight to Orlando, where he gave his final speech in the battle for Florida's vital 25 electoral college votes. </p> <p>\"This great wave starts in southern Florida and works its way up to central Florida and takes Al Gore and me to the White House,\" he told supporters. </p> <p>But the route to the White House is a roundabout one. From Orlando Mr Lieberman flew 1,000 miles to Springdale, north-west Arkansas, Bill Clinton's state, for an 11.15pm rally. An hour later he was back in the air, heading south-west to Albuquerque, New Mexico, another 1,000-mile leg, and his hotel bed. </p> <p>By 7am he was shaking hands in local diners and cafes. Three hours later he was off to Las Vegas, Nevada, 1,470 miles away, another state that the Gore-Lieberman ticket thinks could flip their way. </p> <p>After lunch he was leaving Las Vegas for another 1,000-mile flight, this time to Portland, Oregon, where the Democrats are battling to stop Ralph Nader's voters handing the state to George W Bush. </p> <p>By 5.30pm he still had two more states to visit. The 175-mile flight to Seattle, Washington, took less than an hour, from where he was driven to a local rally. </p> <p>At 9.30pm he was rolling down the runway for the final, and longest leg: Minneapolis, Minnesota, 1,670 miles and two time zones east. </p> <p>By the time the campaign plane touched down in the midwest, it was 2.55am. </p> <p>If that was not enough, he will be notching up a further 2,200 air miles today, from Minnesota to Wisconsin, then to Maine and New Hampshire, before a final stop in Pennsylvania en route to - he hopes - a victory party in Nashville, Tennessee, on polling day tomorrow.</p>",
  "<b> Charlize Theron in Two Days In The Valley</b> (John Herzfeld, 1996) <p><b> Who?</b> South African-born former model. After making her debut in the Tarantino-esque Two Days In The Valley, Theron starred alongside Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves in The Devil's Advocate (1997), and almost managed to save it from total absurdity. But not quite. She fared a bit better as a nameless supermodel who is \"polymorphously perverse\" in Woody Allen's Celebrity (1998) but blew it with a film that managed to make The Devil's Advocate look sophisticated - The Astronaut's Wife (1999). She played the wife of, you've got it, astronaut Johnny Depp, whose Southern accent is almost as bad as her acting.

  "Buried deep in the stack at the Bodleian library in Oxford, from which it is exhumed on average once every 50 years, lies a forgotten early 18th-century book which is both fascinating and disappointing by turns. A rare volume - and deservedly so - Memoirs of the 20th Century: Being Original Letters of State under George VI was the first ever complete work of futurology. <p>Written around 1730 by a clergyman, Samuel Madden, it opens intriguingly enough, with a letter datelined Constantinople, Nov 3 1997, but sadly goes downhill from that point. Madden's 1997 is dominated by a George VI who is a mighty world emperor, but most of the book's 527 turgid pages are mired in contemporary, 18th-century concerns. </p> <p>A couple of ideas suggest, none the less, that Madden really was thinking systematically about the future. He envisages the establishment of public granaries in all villages - pretty radical stuff, really - and even some prototype women's rights legislation. Thirty years later, another, more ambitious forward-looking book appeared, The Reign of George VI, 1900 to 1925, became a bestseller, and futurology was on its way. </p> <p>This George was also a conquering hero, who tames the nations the anonymous author believed would be the miscreants of the early 20th century: France and Russia. The latter, 25,000 of whose troops sack Durham in a war of 1900, is seen as the world's second most powerful nation by this time, with America close behind. Not bad at all as predictions go. </p> <p>The book wasn't all politics, either. It foresaw the legacy of the canal-building boom, which had just begun, and extrapolated that by 1900, a network of waterways would form a superhighway system, with the effect that \"Villages grew into towns and towns became cities\". Substitute trains for barges and you are looking at a decent stab at what today's multinationals call trend forecasting. </p> <p>The Reign of George VI also envisages a king who hates modern architecture so much that he builds a new English capital city, called Stanley, in Rutland, which he fills with neo-classical buildings and surrounds by artificial mountains. Fanciful, perhaps, but strangely reminiscent of our own heir to the throne's ideal village, twee little Poundberry, in Dorset. </p> <p>Futurologists tend not to get a great press. No wonder Samuel Goldwyn was moved to observe, \"Never predict anything - especially the future\", and Arthur C Clarke, whose 2001 has in so many ways failed to materialise, to comment wryly that, \"The future isn't what it used to be.\" </p> <p>Yet it is arguable that we are far too harsh in smug retrospect on those who attempt to peer round chronological corners. Naturally, when we try to envision the future, we always get trivialities such as the fashions and shape of cars wrong. Those sorts of visual cues are decided on a whim rather than a response to need. But most futurological predictions I have come across are almost spookily prescient in more significant respects. Take this extraordinary forecast, made in 1661-70 years before Samuel Madden - in a scientific treatise by the philosopher Joseph Glanvill, a clergyman and chaplain to Charles II, and a founder member of the Royal Society. \"To them that come after us,\" Glanvill wrote, \"It may be as ordinary to buy a pair of wings to fly to the remotest regions, as now a pair of boots to ride a journey; and to confer at the distance of the Indies by sympathetic conveyances, may be as usual in the future as by literary correspondence . . . I doubt not posterity will find many things that are now rumours verified into practical realities. It may be that, some ages hence, a voyage to the Southern tracts, yea possibly to the Moon, will not be more strange than one to America . . . the restoration of grey hairs to juvenility and the renewing of the exhausted marrow may at length be elicited without a miracle; and the turning of the now comparatively desert world into a paradise may not improbably be effected from late agriculture.\" </p> <p>By the late-Victorian era, futurology was becoming really quite slick. Jules Verne described, for example, how musical recitals would by 2000 be sent down a wire from the artist to pianos around the world. Well, MP3 music on the internet hasn't worked out quite like that, but it's hardly dissimilar. </p> <p>An American journalist, David Goodman Croly, writing in 1888 as Sir Oracle, predicted for the coming new century: \"Women throughout the world will enjoy increased opportunities and privileges. Along with this new freedom will come social tolerance of sexual conduct formerly condoned only in men. In addition, because of the greater availability of jobs, more women will choose not to have children.\" </p> <p>Twelve years later, another journalist, John Elfreth Watkins, having interviewed \"the wisest and most careful men in our greatest institutions of science and learning\" on behalf of The Ladies' Home Journal made a brilliant series of consumer predictions. The future, Watkins reported, would witness air-conditioning, international telephones, colour photography, frozen meals, medicine taken through skin patches, snowmobiles, the tapping of energy from wind, tides and sunlight - and out-of-season fruit. </p> <p>Most amazing of all, perhaps, was Watkins's prophecy that, \"Persons and things of all kinds will be brought within focus of cameras connected electrically with screens at opposite end of circuits, thousands of miles at a span.\" </p> <p>John Maynard Keynes, also writing at the end of the 19th century, even prophesied e-commerce: \"The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages.\" (Modern web shoppers will applaud Keynes's foresight, but regret that the \"delivery upon the doorstep\" part has yet to be sorted out.) </p> <p>Oddly enough, the would-be seers who consistently get the future wrong are specialists in their field, the media's beloved \"experts\", whose futurological track record isn't nearly as good as that of those whose approach is that of the generalist (aka, inspired guessing). </p> <p>The first expert futurologist was probably the Dorking vicar and demographer, Thomas Malthus, who in 1798 anonymously wrote a sensational pamphlet sounding the alarm on overpopulation. People had been complaining of overpopulation since Horace in 20BC, but Malthus was so convinced humanity would run out of space within a few years that he favoured effectively culling the working class, for which he was later derided by Karl Marx as \"a miserable parson\". </p> <p>Two hundred years on, Malthus still has his fans, and the fashion for apocalyptic forecasting grows apace. In 1964, a British physicist, John Fremlin, speculated in New Scientist on population trends for the coming 1,000 years, and argued that by the middle of the 29th century, 60,000 trillion people, a million times today's population, would spend their lives lying prone and eating recycled human bodies in cubicles in 2,000 storey buildings spread across both land and what had been sea. </p> <p>The apocalyptic certainty of choice today, of course, is global warming, which if its advocates are right, would be the profoundest ever future prediction. It is worth noting, however, that just a couple of decades ago, many of the same experts were confidently predicting global cooling , and a new ice age. \"A new ice age must now stand alongside a nuclear war as a likely source of wholesale misery and death,\" said International Wildlife magazine in 1975. The next year, Science magazine reported that we were \"heading for extensive northern hemisphere glaciation.\" </p> <p>Even experts proferring non-apocalyptic futurology have been hugely and entertainingly wrong over the years. The Nobel prize winning physicist, Ernest Rutherford, the founder of nuclear physics, once declared that talk of nuclear power was \"moonshine\". Britain's astronomer royal, Sir Harold Spencer Jones, dismissed the idea of space flight as \"bunk\" in 1957 - a fortnight before the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1. </p> <p>And then there was Thomas J Watson, the former CEO of IBM, who never quite lived down a statement he made in the late 1940s: \"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.\" (Perhaps he really meant five computers per household.) No wonder that, in another of his dictums, Arthur C Clarke said that \"when a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right, but when he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.\" </p> <p>So what predictions for the next century would I make, having interviewed dozens of both expert and generalist futurologists, and explored the pitfalls and triumphs of past futurology? Well, I can't see the old favourite, household robots, ever taking off - another massive instruction book to read, another machine to drive us mad with software seizures. </p> <p>It is hard, similarly, to see artificial, computer intelligence being much of a starter, although it's promised for as early as 2015. Even if it could be achieved (which human brain experts are very sceptical of, pointing out that our most powerful computer currently has the intellect of an earthworm) there would, surely, be no market for computers which, when given a boring job, told you to do it your damned self. </p> <p>We like computers, surely, for their artificial stupidity . And if they get too clever, won't they soon start complaining of cruelty? (You laugh, but cruelty to computers is said to be close to becoming a social issue, and is already being discussed by acade mics specialising in human rights.) </p> <p>Genetic engineering will, I strongly suspect, also fail to deliver a fraction of what its advocates promise. There will be endless cases reported in the press around 2025 of people who supposedly had the \"criminal gene\" edited out of their DNA, and subsequently been convicted of car theft. Likewise, parents who paid to have the \"gay gene\" excised (probably illegally) from their children's make-up and ended up disappointed by the result will be locked in litigation with the clinics who did the genetic work. </p> <p>Time travel, I can't see happening either. It took the great Stephen Hawking to point out the obvious objection - that if it were possible, surely we would have seen tourists from the future by now? Quantum teleportation a la Star Trek is said to be a possibility, however. But whether a teleported human will arrive at his destination complete with his mind and memory intact will be an interesting one to watch. </p> <p>Medical advances, meanwhile, may well soon make death a lifestyle option rather than an inevitability, and this could have extraordinary repercussions. If you take the view, for example, that religion has only existed for the past few thousand years because of our fear of death, could the prospect of eternal life finally destroy religion once and for all? And could that, in turn, lead to an overwhelmingly amoral society? </p> <p>Space travel - and the eventual colonisation of other planets is probably inevitable if we all live for hundreds of years - may throw up some interesting conundrums too. For what will be tax position of the colonists? The first generation living on another planet may feel allegiance to the country that paid for their trip and the building of their base. But thereafter, it seems probable that Mars-born humans who only know Earth as a dot in the night sky, might resist attempts to tax them. Maybe there will be a space repeat of the 1773 Boston tea party? </p> <p>One thing is certain for the future. Just as we fervently believe we are living in a special time, and are a special generation witnessing a huge turning point in human affairs - so will our grandchildren and their grandchildren. Every generation thinks the same, and they're always just a little bit wrong. </p> <p>\u0095 A Brief History of Tomorrow: The Future, Past and Present, by Jonathan Margolis, is published by Bloomsbury, priced \u00a314.99</p>",
  "Arriving at Kabul airport for a 6am flight to Herat, in the north-west of Afghanistan, it soon became clear that this was going to be no ordinary journey. For a start, only one other passenger was waiting in the gloom. Everyone else was at the mosque. They were right to pray. If British Airways is the world's favourite airline, then Ariana Airways - Afghanistan's national carrier - is the world's most dangerous. Since America imposed sanctions on Afghanistan a year ago, none of its planes has been serviced. <p>Two years ago an Ariana 727 ploughed into a mountainside, reducing the fleet to three. Then in February, an internal flight to Mazar-i-Sharif was hijacked. The plane ended up at Stansted airport, where most of the passengers promptly claimed asylum. Seeking to calm my nerves, I had asked a pilot the night before departure how safe the remaining two Russian-built Antonov 24 planes were. \"Completely unsafe,\" he replied. \"The pilots are themselves too scared to fly. If I were you I'd throw your ticket in the bin.\" </p> <p>Gradually more passengers emerged into the chilly Kabul morning from yellow and black taxis. Four wraith-like women dressed in faded blue burkas moved among them, begging. Though it has been four years since the Taliban swept into Kabul, Ariana is still issuing the same pre-revolutionary tickets. They carry a picture of Afghanistan's most famous tourist attraction - a giant Buddha statue - on the back. Or at least they did - someone in a back office spends all day scrubbing out the Buddha's face with a black pen. </p> <p>There is no x-ray machine at Kabul airport, which perhaps explains last February's hijack. Instead, a security guard rummages briefly through your luggage. After half an hour we trooped on to the mortar-damaged runway, and climbed aboard. The six burka-clad women on the flight all sat together at the back. And then the engines started - not with the spluttering I had expected but with a confident purr. The plane even took off, rising into the mountains above a shattered city of bombed out houses. </p> <p> I started chatting to Abdul Hakim as we passed over the immense Hindu Kush mountains. Mr Hakim, it transpired, had been Afghanistan's minister for the interior until the Russians invaded in 1979, when he lost his job. He was also friends with Mohammad Daoud, the prime minister, who was murdered in a communist coup. \"The 70s was a marvellous period for Afghanistan. Lots of tourists came here.\" I asked him what he thought of the Taliban. His face fell. \"They have brought peace,\" he said. Mrs Hakim sat silently. With her face still concealed, she discreetly lifted her burka to peer out of the window. </p> <p>About halfway through our two-hour flight, a man carrying a Kalashnikov sauntered down the aisle. He was clearly not the Ariana steward, busy doling out Iranian cherry juice and cake. Sensing my alarm, Mr Hakim explained that since the hijack the Taliban had decreed that two armed guards should travel with every Ariana plane to prevent further mischief. Below us, the undulating Hindu Kush was giving way to a flat, dry landscape. We were nearly at Herat. The wheels popped down. Things were looking up. One of the two tyres on my side of the plane even had tread on it. </p> <p>Herat was the capital of medieval Islam. The city has long been famed for its learning and liberal traditions. All this changed when the Taliban arrived in 1995, closing down the girls' schools and the public baths. But Herat is still a long way from Kabul. Five years on there are signs that its inhabitants are making their own accommodation with the Taliban's edicts. You can secretly buy TV sets here. During the World Cup, rumour has it that five Taliban knocked on the door of someone who had one - not to smash it up, but because they wanted to watch the football.</p>",
  "Children's gym shoes, burned matchsticks and ice lollies dipped in mustard are just some of the cravings that pregnant women have confessed to eating, a survey published today finds. <p>Imminent motherhood appears to turn the nation's women into gruesome gourmets, with custard-covered beetroot, garlic bread with strawberry yoghurt, and even chocolate mixed with salad cream also on the menu. </p> <p>The poll of 200 pregnant women in the UK for vitamin makers Sanatogen found that other strange food cravings admitted to included stuffed olives with lemon curd, chocolate ice cream with prawns and pineapple, and coffee granules on crumpets. </p> <p>Despite their strange tastes, one in 10 women are still unsure about exactly what they are allowed and not allowed to eat while pregnant. An obviously pregnant woman is still a source of fascination for many people, with three quarters of survey respondents saying people had asked to touch their stomachs. </p> <p>But four in five expectant mothers had been forced to stand on public transport because \"modern men\" failed to give up their seats for them. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Maternity Alliance said: \"If a craving seems very bizarre, it's worth checking with your doctor or midwife.\" </p>",
  "It is amazing what effect mortality can have on political fortunes. As a living, breathing and campaigning candidate for senator of Missouri, Mel Carnahan was narrowly behind in the polls. Then he died. The rules dictated that his name had to remain on the ballot. Now he is in the lead. <p>Donald Dewar's much lamented departure is now having a similar effect on the Scottish parliament. While he was alive, the governing body he had done so much to create had been embraced by Scots in principle but was struggling to inspire confidence in practice. </p> <p>Rightly or wrongly, the new administration was regarded as profligate (the building for the new parliament ran six times over budget), irrelevant (paralysed by rows about fox hunting and sex education in schools) and besieged. In March, Labour not only lost a byelection in Ayr to the Tories, it slumped to third place; the Liberal Democrats, Labour's coalition partner, came fifth, behind the Scottish Socialist Party. </p> <p>The administration was assailed by populists on the left (the Scottish National party and former Labour party dissidents such as Tommy Sheridan and Dennis Canavan) and the right (the millionaire owner of Stagecoach, Brian Souter, ploughed thousands into keeping section 28, which discriminated against lesbians and gay men). Worse still, since at least the aforementioned difficulties were of the administration's own doing, it also started to look like a magnet for bad luck. While the rest of Britain's economy was booming, Scotland's started to contract slightly. Then in August came the exam fiasco, in which thousands of university hopefuls received the wrong grades. </p> <p>In the referendum on devolution in 1997, 74.3% of Scots voted for a Scottish parliament. Two years later, one poll showed 72% believed the parliament was either doing a bad job or didn't care how it was doing. </p> <p>But less than a month after Dewar's death, things are starting to look up. The Scottish executive has just announced that the elderly will now get free long-term nursing home care, unlike their counterparts in England and Wales. Canavan, a life-long Labour party member who stood and won against Labour after he was not selected to stand for the Scottish parliament, has embarked on a process of reconciliation with the party. Dewar's successor, Henry McLeish, has conducted a thorough and deft reshuffle. The entire Scottish Qualifications Association, which was responsible for the exam debacle, has been persuaded to resign. The economy is showing signs of growth. As England and Wales wade through muddy flood waters, even the sun is shining on Edinburgh. </p> <p>This does not mean that Dewar was a failure or that McLeish is a success. Far from it. Dewar, one of Labour's unspun heroes, had a genuine personal following in Scotland; very few Scottish people have much of an opinion about McLeish one way or another. It is more a sign of the times. For Dewar is not the only person Scottish politics has lost suddenly and recently. Shortly before he died, Alex Salmond resigned as leader of the SNP. Within a month, Scottish politics lost the two men who, together, have dominated the landscape for the past decade and oversaw the transition from Westminster to Holyrood. </p> <p>When Salmond became leader of the SNP, in 1990, the Tories were using Scotland to test-drive the poll tax and the SNP, the smallest party in Scotland, had branded Labour's Scottish MPs \"the feeble 50\" because of their inability to do anything about it. By the time Dewar died, Scotland had a parliament that had voted to abolish poindings and warrant sales and Salmond was the leader of the opposition. </p> <p>But while both Dewar and Salmond were synonymous with Scotland, they bore the indelible imprimatur of Westminster. It was on Westminster's terms that they made their names - for there were no other terms - and fought their battles. They came to Holyrood gladly, but they did not come from there. Their successors are a different story altogether. Both are virtually unknown outside Scotland; indeed most Scots would struggle to pick out John Swinney, the new leader of the SNP, in an identity parade. Their performance at the despatch box this week - the first time they have duelled togther - was dire. </p> <p>Undoubtedly they will grow into their respective jobs, although it is too early to tell in what direction they will take their parties. McLeish seems to be heading for a more populist agenda. His principal achievement so far is changing the name of the culture and sports portfolio to sports and culture - less Puccini and Bach, more pies and Bovril. He has said he wants to concentrate on \"core issues\", such as health and education, rather than gay rights and fox hunting. It is true that he has not travelled as far as Dewar, but that also means he is carrying less baggage. He could persuade Canavan not to resign his Westminster seat and force a byelection that Labour would probably have lost. Dewar could not because he and Canavan had a long-standing feud. </p> <p>Swinney, meanwhile, has declared himself more of a gradualist. He wants to show that the SNP is fit to govern on bread-and-butter issues in Holyrood before he moves on to the big prize of independence by referendum. </p> <p>But their low profile south of the border and scarcely developed agendas are no bad thing. For it is less important where they are going than where they have come from. Their big chance has come not in Westminster but Holyrood. Their success or failure will be defined in terms of how they fare in Edinburgh, not London. As the past 18 months have demonstrated, the terms of debate are very different up here. Scottish politics is more religious and less rural than that of Britain as a whole; the indications so far are that Scotland is likely to be less socially progressive but more economically redistributive. To hold its own here Labour must look to its left not its right. </p> <p>The parliament has a higher proportion of women than the Commons but no ethnic minorities. Scottish backbench MPs in Westminster have taken to complaining that they cannot get their voice heard here because the media are too busy covering Holyrood. That is the way it should be. \"Devolution creates institutions whose leaders have to have the confidence of those institutions rather than Westminster,\" says John Curtice, a politics professor at Strathclyde university. </p> <p>It is a truism Tony Blair has had to learn the hard way; the consequences go beyond Scotland. Now that McLeish is in charge in Holyrood the four men Blair wished to carry his mantle during the first wave of devolution have all gone. Their careers have been cut short - by disgrace (Ron Davies), death (Dewar), defeat at the polls (Frank Dobson) and defeat in an assembly (Alun Michael). The two men the Labour machine fought hard, and at times dirtily, to deny the top jobs in Wales (Rhodri Morgan) and London (Ken Livingstone) are both in place. And, despite dire warnings to the contrary, the sky has not fallen in. The political institutions are in place: now the political cultures must flourish. The transition period is over. Like Dewar, may it rest in peace. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gary.younge@theguardian.com\">gary.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The Italian government has tried to shore up its constitutional authority by blocking a referendum in Veneto, the region that includes Venice, on greater independence from Rome. <p>The president of Veneto, Giancarlo Galan, vowed to press ahead with the referendum on the constitution that the wealthy region proposed last week, a draft which some described as near secession. </p> <p>Mr Galan, who belongs to the centre-right coalition which is expected to win next year's general election, wants to keep two-thirds of the tax revenues raised in Veneto and to control health, education, immigration, law and order, and elements of foreign policy. </p> <p>Francesco Rutelli, the centre-left's candidate for prime minister, denounced the plan as a recipe for a Yugoslavian-type disintegration. </p> <p>A cabinet meeting decided that a referendum could be called only by the central government. </p> <p>It would interfere with the devolution bill which it aims to push through the senate this week.</p>"
