  "<p>England's only warm-up match before they begin their assault on the ICC Knockout Trophy ended in a tie against Australia here yesterday, but the sense of drama and excitement was lost on Ashley Giles. He felt only pain in his leg and a terrible sinking feeling in his stomach. </p> <p>Giles, the Warwickshire left-arm spinner, managed just five deliveries before leaving the field with a strained left calf. He experienced a couple of twinges at the start of his over and then, as he walked towards his team-mates to celebrate holding a return catch to dismiss Michael Bevan, the pain became extreme. </p> <p>The England physiotherapist Dean Conway immediately applied ice and Giles was dispatched to the team hotel with his leg heavily strapped. He can count himself a seriously unlucky man and must wonder whether he will ever play more than the occasional match for his country. </p> <p>Giles has been selected for 34 England one-day international squads, but has made the starting line-up only five times. He is unlikely to play in England's first game against Bangladesh tomorrow and is considered doubtful for the entire two-week tournament. </p> <p>If the injury turns out to be serious, Giles would be replaced by Robert Croft, the official spin-bowling cover who publicly and angrily contemplated never playing for England again after missing selection for this winter's tours. </p> <p>Despite their problems, the coach Duncan Fletcher says he cannot remember a squad more prepared to work hard - England have been undertaking regular 5-hour sessions. But they needed a competitive outing and that, even in a practice game, was exactly what they got against the world one-day champions. England bowled well and, until a late stutter, batted consistently, although Glenn McGrath was rested and Shane Warne was missing with injury. </p> <p>Damien Martyn made 70 and Mark Waugh a half-century from 39 balls before he retired. Andrew Caddick and Craig White each collected a couple of wickets and England's out-cricket was generally impressive on a rough outfield. </p> <p>Each of the 14 squad members was allowed to play some part and the main batsmen all made starts. Alec Stewart's 38 was the highest but Nasser Hussain's 21, which hinted at a return to form, was the most gratifying. </p> <p>England needed five from the final over but Mark Alleyne was adjudged leg-before and Caddick, attempting the winning hit, was spectacularly caught at square-leg by Brett Lee. \"I think most of the players benefited from missing the last couple of championship matches,\" Fletcher said afterwards. \"It means they are fresh.\" </p> <p> <strong> Australia 236-9</strong> (DR Martyn 70, SR Waugh 50; Caddick 2-19).</p> <p><strong> England 236</strong> (AJ Stewart 38; Symonds 3-16, Lee 3-51).</p> <p><strong> Match tied.</strong></p>",

  "<p> My birthday only comes once a year. And what a great party! </p> <p> But Jack Straw gives the criminals a party every day while victims wait outside in the cold. </p> <p> His greetings telegram to the criminal is: 'don't worry, there are nearly 3,000 fewer police to catch you, and even if you are unlucky enough to be caught, I'll let you out of jail in record time.' </p> <p> In The Wizard of Oz, the Man of Straw had no brain. I can show you one with no heart and no courage as well. </p> <p> He and his friend Tony promised to be 'tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime'. All they've been tough on is the dwindling number of people trying to fight crime. Last year, I warned that the thin blue line was getting thinner. Now it's becoming a row of dots, which nobody wants to join. </p> <p> High on promises, low on action. Long on spin, short on truth. Drunk on power, incapable of delivery. </p> <p> It's not that they're short on rhetoric when it comes to victims. Remember what Tony Blair said in his speech last week? </p> <p> Tony Blair said that one of the big projects for the second term of a Labour government - and I quote - would be 'standing up for victims'. </p> <p> Why is he waiting for a second term? It's not as if he's going to get one. </p> <p> What a sense of priorities. They've spent the first term getting prisoners out of jail early, cutting the police force, multiplying red tape, and dreaming of drunks at cashpoints. The victim has to wait for the second term. </p> <p> By contrast, my first pledge as shadow home secretary, the very first policy I announced, was new rights for victims enshrined in law. </p> <p> That shows where this party's priorities lie. What about the rest of Jack Straw's record at the Home Office? </p> <p> Police numbers down, crime up, violent crime soaring, the asylum system in chaos, spies laughing at the country they betrayed\u0085 </p> <p> When we were debating rising crime under this Government, I asked Jack Straw whether crime would fall again. He said: 'That depends on the criminals.' </p> <p> I thought it was traditional for the British people to rely on their government to cut crime, not on the criminals. It cannot be common sense to fight crime with fewer crimefighters. It cannot be common sense, when the police have spent time and effort arresting people, to see the criminal back on the street before the police officer. It cannot be common sense to let prisoners sit around in idleness. It cannot be common sense to allow persistent young menaces to grow up with the belief that they are untouchable at law. It cannot be common sense to arrest the householder instead of the burglar. </p> <p> We need common sense. </p> <p> This country needs a well-motivated, strong police force that can protect everyone, regardless of race, colour or creed. But when the police have done their job, the public must be protected by proper, effective sentencing. </p> <p> When those sentences include custody, protecting the public doesn't end at the prison gate. It means work and education inside prisons to give inmates the skills to lead a law-abiding life outside. </p> <p> You are already aware that we have promised to restore police numbers. But numbers alone are not the only answer. We must make sure that every single policeman makes the most effective use of every minute of his time. Yet officers regularly tell me that they can spend an entire shift processing a single criminal through custody, and that they have to fill in the same information on form after form. Indeed, from what they tell me I can only conclude that the police have got more form than the criminals they arrest. For too long, politicians have observed this and done nothing. It is time to relieve the police of this crippling burden. </p> <p> It is plain common sense that a policeman should come into the station, deliver his prisoner with a short statement and go straight back onto the beat to arrest more criminals. And that's what's going to happen on my watch. And if that means taking a large part of the custody function away from the police, that's what I'll do. </p> <p> So we're going to restore the numbers. And we're going to make sure they spend their time more effectively. And we're going to make sure that they spend their time in the rural areas as well as the urban. </p> <p> Many rural people feel isolated from the forces of law and order. They rarely see their local bobby. Where there is an emergency, they wait far too long for a response. </p> <p> For those who live in sparsely populated areas, this is a real, live problem. So I've been looking for real, live solutions. I believe that there are lots of ways that we can get visible policing in our countryside. Through retained police officers, part-time police officers, specials, greater use of retired officers, and through 'cops in shops'. </p> <p> Cops in shops is a very simple initiative, which I saw in Washington. The officer doesn't go back to the station to write up his reports, he writes them up in shops and other public places. This has a threefold advantage. First of all, he's visible. Secondly, he can interact with the community. And thirdly, he is a deterrent. </p> <p> One of the reasons why we have such problems in recruiting is that very often, young people lose interest between the time they leave school and the time they are old enough to join the police. So I want to re-introduce a police cadet force which will not only provide a recruiting and training ground for both the regular police and the specials, but will fundamentally change young people's attitude towards the police at a time in their lives when it is most important. </p> <p> Instead of being tough on criminals, Tony Blair and Jack Straw operate a revolving door prisons policy. </p> <p> On Jack Straw's own tagging scheme, criminals sentenced to six months get out of jail in six weeks - even John Prescott gets through more of his sentences. </p> <p> And so 23,000 convicts have been let out early. </p> <p> Including 200 convicted killers </p> <p> Thousands of other violent criminals. </p> <p> Nearly 150 convicted of assaulting police. </p> <p> More than 900 robbers </p> <p> Over 2,100 burglars </p> <p> 3,000 drug dealers </p> <p> And when, but for Jack Straw's measure, they should have been in jail, these criminals have committed even more crimes - over 700 more. </p> <p> Dozens of burglaries and thefts </p> <p> Threats to kill </p> <p> Drug dealing </p> <p> Even two rapes </p> <p> The next Conservative government will scrap this tagging scheme, this mammoth insult to victims. </p> <p> I'm against early release in all but one case. There is only one early release that I will be prepared to see in the public interest. That's Jack Straw's early release from the chains of office - and Tony Blair and the rest of the Labour party with him. </p> <p> And instead, we will introduce honesty in sentencing. With the complete abolition of automatic early release. </p> <p> Sentences will say what they mean and mean what they say. </p> <p> Discounts will have to be earned and will not be substantial - unlike now. </p> <p> Where a custodial sentence is passed, we will ensure that there is a programme of rehabilitation in place. Too many offenders who are sent to prison go on to re-offend. </p> <p> By ensuring that they have an alternative to a continuation of their life of crime, we can better protect the public. </p> <p> Idle prisons are breeding grounds for the disease of crime. We will move towards a full working day in all prisons, based on self-financing workshops that take on real work which real employers want in the real world. Prisoners' wages will go towards the cost of their upkeep, the support of their families, savings to give them a start when they leave prison, and reparations to the victims of crime. </p> <p> It is all about protecting the public. </p> <p> And we've got to start with the young criminals. We will take the young menaces off the streets, away from the environment that has failed them, and give them a real chance to change. Last year I set out proposals to do this, placing them in secure training and giving them a stable regime and a real chance to change. This year, I want to look beyond young criminals, at the single biggest cause of crime, particularly but not exclusively amongst the young. </p> <p> The single biggest cause of crime in this country today is drugs. </p> <p> Children are 20% of our population but they are 100% of our future. Drugs are the cancer that is eating away at our country and threatening those children and that future. </p> <p> It's not our children who are the only victims. Crime costs this country \u00a350bn a year - and at least a third of all crimes are drug related. Eighty per cent of burglaries are motivated by drugs. </p> <p> One third of acquisitive crime is drug-related, costing victims over \u00a32bn a year. </p> <p> More than 100,000 people are convicted or cautioned for drug offences every year. </p> <p> Even if they end up in court, many get a conditional discharge or a small fine. </p> <p> Not exactly tough. </p> <p> What do the other parties offer? </p> <p> The Liberal Democrats toy with legalisation. And they want to end the tough mandatory sentences for drug dealers. </p> <p> In other words, give in. What they want to do is against all common sense. </p> <p> Labour promised a war against drugs. </p> <p> What have they done with the drug dealers? Given them the get out of jail free card. </p> <p> 23,000 criminals let out on special early release scheme, and more than 3,000 have been drug dealers or traffickers. </p> <p> Drug dealers who on average got 22 months' jail. </p> <p> Under Labour they served nine months. </p> <p> So what will we do? </p> <p> We have already pledged tougher sentences for drug dealers who sell to our children and a crackdown on drugs in and around our schools. And, needless to say, we will scrap the get out of jail free card for 3,000 drug dealers. </p> <p> Today I am able to announce a new policy. Earlier this year, I visited New York, where under Mayor Giuliani crime has plummeted. Although we can't replicate exactly what I saw there, we can learn the lessons of tackling crime head on and not conceding a centimetre to the criminals. So today, I can announce a new policy. A policy that means no quarter for those whose trade is dealing in human misery, despair and even death. </p> <p> And so, from the possession of the most minimal amount of soft drugs right up the chain to the large importer, there will be no hiding place. There will be zero tolerance. </p> <p> Parents want it. Schools need it. Our future demands it. The next Conservative government will do it. </p> <p> What does it mean? It means zero tolerance of possession. No more getting away with just a caution, no more hoping that a blind eye will be turned. If someone possesses drugs, the minimum for a first offence will be a fixed penalty of \u00a3100. But not for a second offence. Then it's into court. </p> <p> And no more claiming that no matter what amount you've got on you, it's for personal use. Over and above the smallest amount, the charge will be substantial possession, and the penalties applicable will be of a range comparable to those for dealing. </p> <p> And as for the suppliers, we will put them out of business. </p> <p> We will dedicate police resources and police officers to identifying and cleaning up forever those houses and other places where regular supply takes place. And the replacement suppliers, and their replacements, and their replacements, until there are no more replacements. </p> <p> Yes, this will require extra money, yes this will require extra police officers, and yes they will be forthcoming. That will be money well spent. </p> <p> And there are other aspects of our drugs laws which we need to change. Why do you lose your licence for drink-driving, but not for drugs driving? In future, anybody caught driving with illegal substances in their bloodstream will be subject to a mandatory ban. Why should it be that you have illegal drugs in your pocket, you're guilty of possession, but when they're in your bloodstream, you're guilty of nothing? </p> <p> Why do we have laws against opium dens which don't apply to crack houses? </p> <p> Zero tolerance of the biggest scourge in our society today. That's what's going to happen on my watch. </p> <p> Other things will change also. Our asylum system will be completely overhauled and we will automatically house all new applicants in secure reception centres. It's extraordinary, but Labour call that racist. Yet the biggest loser in their system is the genuine refugee who comes to this country with not only a legal but a moral case for a safe haven, and finds himself clogged up in queue which has hit more than 100,000 cases - double what Labour inherited. If the message goes out to those who simply seek to play our system that in future they will be detained, dealt with speedily and removed, they will cease to come and we will be able to process the genuine applicant more quickly. However, for the real refugee, reception centres will provide a one-stop point of expertise in education for the children, language support, and social services support. </p> <p> At the moment such people, with all their vulnerability and needs are turned out to take their chance in areas where the local authorities have no experience in coping and where the provision of such services is a hit and miss affair. </p> <p> Let me make clear to Tony Blair what I believe - what is my 'irreducible core'. </p> <p> If you're asking me to stand by and see the genuine refugee stuck in a queue with tens of thousands of other applications; </p> <p> If you're asking me to tolerate a situation where that man waits months or years for a decision on his case while Ministers dither and officials shuffle paper; </p> <p> If you're asking me to put up with a shambolic system of support which is letting down both the refugees and the local councils and the local people who have to pick up the pieces, then vote for the other man, because I won't do it. </p> <p> Letting down genuine refugees. I don't think I could do that. Could you? </p> <p> Releasing 23,000 prisoners extra-early. I don't think I could do that. Could you? </p> <p> Cut police numbers when crime is rising. I don't think I could that. Could you? </p> <p> Surrender to the drugs menace. We couldn't do that. We shouldn't do that. </p> <p> We won't do that.</p>",
  "Romano Prodi, president of the European Commission, issued a stern warning to EU states yesterday not to reduce integration to mere cooperation between governments. <p>In an unusually hard speech, interpreted as criticism of France and Britain, Mr Prodi told members of the European Parliament at Strasbourg that there was a danger that the EU would become either an \"international talking shop\" or a \"government of bureaucrats\" if this trend was not reversed. </p> <p>Seeking to re-establish his authority after enduring months of criticism and demoralisation in Brussels, Mr Prodi made clear that he expected the EU's 15 members to agree to far-reaching changes - including less use of national vetoes - at their Nice summit in December. </p> <p>France's president, Jacques Chirac, ruffled feathers in the summer when he called for a \"pioneer group\" of countries to lead the EU, failing to mention the commission - the unique supranational executive of the EU where elements of sovereignty are pooled. </p> <p>Diplomats suspected that Mr Prodi was in part trying to make a pre-emptive strike before Tony Blair's heavily trailed speech in Warsaw on Friday: it is expected to call for closer collaboration between EU governments, an implicit relegation of EU institutions. </p> <p>British officials often privately give the impression they regret the choice of Mr Prodi, a former Italian prime minister, after the fall of the discredited Santer commission last year. EU sources insisted the commission president was not attacking specific national leaders, but was concerned about the general trend. </p> <p>\"This is meant to be a strong warning,\" said one official. </p> <p>\"Enhancing the intergovernmental model at the expense not only of the commission but also, ultimately, of the council [of ministers] would ... undermine the democratic nature of the whole European structure and would be a seriously retrograde step,\" Mr Prodi said in Strasbourg. </p> <p>Much of his speech was devoted to urging governments to settle long overdue institutional reforms, due for review at the Biarritz summit in a fortnight finalisation at Nice. </p> <p>Limiting national vetoes, Mr Prodi said, was the most important reform needed for an enlarged EU to function properly: decisions requiring unanimity should be restricted to an \"absolute minimum\". </p> <p>And in a message that will be especially unwelcome to Mr Blair, Mr Prodi signalled that no one should prevent a group of EU members from achieving closer union - eurospeak for saying that a \"two-speed Europe\" is a good thing. </p> <p>Denmark's rejection of the European single currency in a referendum last week - and the probability that Sweden and Britain will delay their own referendums - has made the two-speed option likelier. </p> <p>Mr Prodi received a rousing ovation, and Pat Cox, leader of the Liberal group of MEPs, said his speech had been the commission president's \"finest hour\" in his year in office. </p> <p>He urged governments to do more to promote a positive view of the possible near-doubling of EU membership over the next few years, in hopes of preventing extreme rightwing parties exploiting rising crime and mass immigration. </p> <p>Controversially, he also called for the commission to be given greater powers in formulating EU foreign and economic policies.</p>",
  "Michael Portillo yesterday returned from exile to the Conservative conference platform with an extraordinary mixture of the new \"touchy-feely\" confessional politics and the traditional Tory promise to combine better public services with lower taxes. <p>\"I plan to spend more on public services in every year than Labour has spent in any year. But I don't intend to spend money the country hasn't earned. I will leave room for tax cuts,\" said Mr Portillo - setting out the election formula he has agreed with William Hague. </p> <p>Treasury ministers leapt on that last night because Mr Portillo later admitted on BBC2's Conference Live that his pledge to match Labour's spending on the NHS does not \"at the moment\" extend to education or transport. </p> <p>Labour renewed its claims that a Hague cabinet would gouge \u00a316 billion from Gordon Brown's spending plans, though aides confirmed yesterday that the shadow chancellor has told his leader that he will initially stick to Labour's spending plans. </p> <p>That would mean only gradually moving to get spending growth below the underlying trend growth in the economy, 2.2% a year, compared with Mr Brown's promised 3.3%. </p> <p>But what Mr Portillo called \"dry economics\" was not what caught the conference's attention. It was his relaxed style, enhanced by the fact that his 30 minute speech had been memorised by heart. </p> <p>In his first appearance as shadow chancellor since returning to Westminster last winter, Mr Portillo went out of his way to show how he has changed since his hard-line \"Who dares?\" speech in the same Bournemouth conference hall in 1995. </p> <p>\"I was devastated by my defeat (in Enfield in 1997)....but the British electorate did me a favour. My period out of parliament was a chance to connect with the Britain of today,\" Mr Portillo declared, explaining that his exposure to poverty and illness - as a TV reporter and hospital porter - had left an indelible mark. </p> <p>\"My job is not just about dry economics. The quality of life cannot be measured in material terms alone. We are the party that understands how much the world has changed,\" he told party activists. </p> <p>Mr Hague has been pushing the moderate \"hot buttons\" in Bournemouth in what is likely to be the last pre-election conference. At a Bow Group rally yesterday, the shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, admitted that politics is held in \"widespread contempt\". But Mr Portillo's contrition was the most dramatic. He spoke out for \"rich ethnic diversity\" - exemplified by Britain's Olympic success - for respect towards sexual minorities, for state school pupils like himself and William Hague and even for asylum seekers \"who come to Britain in fear of their lives. </p> <p>\"That's how my father came,\" Mr Portillo, son of a leftwing professor who fled the Spanish civil war, reminded his audience. Later he denounced \"Little Englandism\" - with which he was once associated - asking how a half-Spaniard could be one. </p> <p>During his denunciation of the European single currency which \"fails to respect Europe's differences\" the former defence secretary even lapsed briefly into a Spanish proverb, a version of \"look before you leap.\" This was a new Portillo, clearly meant to be less macho or arrogant than in his Thatcherite heyday. </p> <p>There was a political motive behind his portrait of the new Britain as flexible, self-reliant and responsible. Britain would be stronger \"if we had fewer politicians passing fewer laws, raising fewer taxes and intruding less in our lives. Young people reject the Labour party's bossiness, meddling, banning and regulating,\" he said. </p> <p>The core of the shadow chancellor's economic message yesterday was therefore a renewed pledge to cut taxes -on business and enterprise - focus public spending effectively, to simplify both Labour regulation and over-complicated taxes. </p> <p>He also accused Gordon Brown of stealth taxes on the poor which are unfair. \"There is no social justice in high taxation,\"he said. </p> <p>Another priority will be to increase the savings ratio - the amount of income which households save - down from 10.6% in 1997 to 3% according to figures issued yesterday. </p> <p>Justifying his much-trailed gamble on using private health insurance to generate more cash for the NHS, Mr Portillo claimed: \"there's a consensus among the parties that we should spend much more money on the NHS, but not on how to spend it or how that money can be supplemented.\" </p> <p>In his speech yesterday Mr Maude set out rules for the New Toryism - starting by making \"relentless honesty\" its first hallmark. Integrity and a willingness to \"admit it when we have got things wrong and to apologise,\" are also necessary to regain public respect. </p> <p>Like Mr Portillo he deplored Little England attitudes and said the Tories must be a national party. Mr Maude called for sexual tolerance and made a Portillo-esque reference to his own private life, his gay brother who died of Aids.</p>",
  "In yesterday's front page report from Israel we referred to the first death of an Israeli civilian on Monday. We should have said the first Israeli Jewish civilian. Seven Israeli Arabs also died in the violence on Monday. <p>A report on page 28, Jobs &amp; Money, September 30, began by saying that earlier this year, the Home Office minister Barbara Roche described some asylum seekers as \"vile\". That is not true. Ms Roche explained in a letter to the Guardian on September 7: \"I have never described asylum seekers as vile, though this is precisely what I think of the practice of using children as an aid to begging.\" The distinction was clearly made in the original interview on The World This Weekend, March 19, this year, which has since been misquoted. </p> <p>In a front page report headed Ministers vent fuel fury, Septmber 16, we said that the education secretary David Blunkett had accused protesting farmers of being self-interested subsidy junkies.

  "<p>Radio Times says <strong> You Can't Take It With You </strong> (Channel 5) is \"An American comedy series based on the stage play by Moss Hart and George Kaufman, about a family of eccentrics living on Staten Island, New York, at the turn of the century.\" This is probably actionable under the sale of goods act. Not an American comedy series at all, it was, in fact, about an old dear distributing her bits and pieces between three politely unenthused daughters. </p> <p>Rather like King Lear without the name calling and double pneumonia. </p> <p>The idea of You Can't Take It With You is that Eric Knowles - he of the waggish moustache and bright bow tie - should value the possessions you are going to share among your family and sit in on the subsequent carnage. Dividing up the dibs is always delicate. I cannot repeat in the modesty of print what my mother said when she saw my aunt sneaking downstairs with my deceased father's trousers. Her explanation, that she was trying to spare my mother's feelings by removing the trousers from view, cut little ice, but it certainly cut down the sobbing and gave us all an appetite for the baked ham. </p> <p>The idea might have worked better if the family concerned had been American eccentrics. Happily, Connie, the mother, had a mother lode of mischief (\"It's a game to her. I think she likes to wind us up, one against the other\") which promised well. The daughters, while perfectly pleasant about her little treasures, naturally all had their eye on the family home. Hence the force of Connie's wicket-splintering last words, \"You all think you're going to get a third share of the house, but I'm going to sell it and travel the world.\" The daughters were terribly nice about it in a slightly dazed way. </p> <p>I warm towards anything 10 minutes long. Almost everything in life, including life, is too long. Anything important can be said in 10 minutes. Trivia, naturally, takes longer. <strong> Marion And Geoff</strong> (BBC2) is 10 minutes long. Of course, if you stick the 10 episodes together, it is 100 minutes long. Keith would point out something like that. Keith, like the duckbilled platypus, is funny, endearing and wholly unfitted for life on this planet or any other. </p> <p>Neither Marion nor Geoff appear in Marion and Geoff. It is a monologue by Keith (Rob Brydon), a minicab driver, who is making a video diary in an unfortunate choice of shirts during the longeurs of waiting for a fare. Marion, his wife, has left him for Geoff, taking their two terrifying children. \"Reece is a very sensitive child. He likes to draw. Anywhere. He'll draw anywhere. Alun is a different kettle of fish altogether. A very violent child.\" </p> <p>Keith seems to skip across the tragedy of his life like a water boatman without getting his feet wet or even realizing he should be drowning. In the first episode he is driving to Wales to see his children. \"The kids aren't that far away if you think about it. It's motorway all the way. I can do it now in a flat four-and-a-half hours.\" The world passes continuously across his window without ever touching him. He never actually seems to see his children nor hand over his carefully chosen presents: the drawing kit, the action man. \"He likes this a lot - Marion said. But he's into charcoals now, which is good. And this, would you believe it, he's got it! He's got the whole range! That's Geoff, you see. Little tinker!\" </p> <p>Geoff, who seeps out between the lines of Keith's innocent monologue, is something randy in pharmaceuticals. Keith consoles himself that his sons regard him as a figure of romance. \"I'm elusive in the fact that I travel around a lot and that, I think, can be quite romantic. A bit like Zorro, but without the mask. I couldn't wear a mask in this job though, it would create more problems than it would solve.\" Yesterday he produced a rifle, a treasured souvenir of his father, who shot himself. I cannot but feel that Keith's habit of watching his home, wife and children (now Geoff's home, wife and children) through binoculars, a rifle sight and, indeed, his eyebrows could lay his actions open to misconstruction. With or without a mask. </p> <p> <strong> Animal Hospital</strong> (BBC1) is back, with not only Rolf Harris, but the surreal ROLF HARRIS TURTLE UNIT. KEEP OUT! RISK OF DEATH! This dire warning seems a little unfair to turtles, one of the few creatures I have seen cry and, despite rumour to the contrary, largely unskilled in the ninja art of stealth and assassination. Unless it refers to Rolf Harris.</p>",
  "Four years after overrunning Kabul, the fundamentalist zealots of Afghanistan's Taliban are coming in from the cold. Not that recent meetings with the US, France, the UN, and old regional foes like Uzbekistan signify an overdue lurch to moderation by the bloody-minded, misogynistic men from the Ministry of Vice and Virtue and other bastions of intolerance. Possibly definitive military successes against rump government forces in the north-east and the fomenting of a destabilising, expanding Islamic militancy in central Asia are lending the hitherto isolated, ostracised Taliban a new and menacing international clout. <p>China, concerned about the impact on its restless Muslim minority, has joined Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in condemning cross-border incursions by Taliban-backed radicals from Uzbekistan's Fergana valley. Russia, the former regional superpower expelled from Afghanistan in 1989, is also alarmed. Last June, Moscow and Washington jointly decried the \"growing influence of extremist groups\". Both have stepped up military aid to Afghanistan's northern neighbours. Russia, which maintains 25,000 border troops in Tajikistan, has threatened air strikes. Last month, the US sent Central Command chief General Tommy Franks to Kyrgyzstan with a $3m cheque for army training. India, meanwhile, complains about Pakistani and Afghan-backed violence in Kashmir. </p> <p>The Taliban provide a common link in a wide range of escalating problems. The civil war has created an enormous, unaddressed refugee crisis on the Tajik border, exacerbated by the most severe Asian drought for 50 years. The Taliban's growing ascendancy has coincided with an upsurge in heroin smuggling (Afghanistan is the world's largest opium producer). The regime continues by all accounts to train and harbour other people's terrorists, notably Osama bin Laden, the alleged 1998 bomber of US embassies in Africa who is now also linked to an August assassination attempt on Vladimir Putin by Chechens in Yalta. The Taliban's close military collaboration with Pakistan's loose-cannon leader, General Pervez Musharraf, is another geo-strategic wild card. Crucially, this instability hinders regional development, incites repressive governance, and compounds the poverty on which militancy feeds. Little wonder then that, repulsive though they remain, the world suddenly wants to talk to the Taliban.</p>",
  "John Major has been drafted in by William Hague to lend credibility to a series of \"one nation\" policies unveiled by the Tory leadership in Bournemouth this week. <p>Senior members of the shadow cabinet have been instructed to brief the former prime minister on their announcements to ensure they win support from the man who has cast himself as the champion of the party's one nation wing. </p> <p>The top billing enjoyed by Mr Major contrasts with a low key performance by Margaret Thatcher who hijacked last year's conference when she appeared at a pro-Pinochet rally. </p> <p>During a one day visit to Bournemouth yesterday, Lady Thatcher appeared on the platform - where she received a standing ovation - but made no formal speech. </p> <p>Her only intervention of the day was to round on the government for perpetrating a \"fraud\" on pensioners. The for mer prime minister said: \"This government has put a means test of old age pensions so that thousands and thousands of people who paid contributions all their lives are not getting their pensions. That to me is outright fraud.\" </p> <p>Mr Major had underlined his anger with Mr Hague's lurch to the right when he told a fringe meeting at the Tory conference on Monday that the party had failed to reach out to voters \"outside the circle of rising prosperity\". </p> <p>However, the former prime minister believes that Mr Hague is now making a genuine bid to reach out to voters on the centre ground. The Tory leader launched this week's conference with a pledge to revitalise Britain's inner cities and the leadership promised yesterday to outspend Labour on health, though this will involve a greater role for the private sector. </p> <p>Mr Major has been briefed on all the new policies announced this week, which have met with his approval. \"The shadow cabinet have been consulting me, they have been meticulous and call me regularly,\" Mr Major said. \"I have suggested some policies, but I take no credit for any of it. I repeat I take no credit.\" </p> <p>Some Tories on the left of the party, who were exasperated by Mr Hague's provocative interventions on asylum seekers and law and order, believe that the leadership's conversion to one nation policies is too little too late. Sir Edward Heath spoke up for the critics yesterday when he accused Mr Hague of making up policies \"on the spur of the moment\". Asked whether he agreed with this view, Mr Major indicated some sympathy with the \"wets\" when he said: \"Maybe.\" </p> <p>The new warmth between Mr Major and the Tory leadership marks an important rapprochement after the shadow cabinet attempted at last year's conference to airbrush the former prime minister out of Conservative history. </p> <p>Mr Major, who pointedly went on holiday to Venice during last year's gathering, was deeply hurt. Tory activists demonstrated their affection for Mr Major at his fringe meeting on Monday night, which was packed out.</p>",
  "\"For we are the people of England that never have spoken yet!\" one speech ended, with a Chestertonian flourish. True enough. Looking round the hall, this rum crowd led by an even weirder lot on the platform never has and never will speak for England. \"We are the oldest political party in the world!\" the chairman proclaimed to a roar of applause. Nearer the truth but even that can't be quite right either. Surely the Chinese gerontocracy must be a bit older? Tory party membership fell again this year - maybe not defections, just dropping off the perch. Who's left? Staring-eyed young men who babble only Europhobia, rich farmers and rather cross old women. <p>Arriving in Bournemouth determined to be a) fair and b) scared, it was an impossible task. Everything should be going the Conservatives' way - the Danish No vote, the \"great September tax revolt\" and the first - if brief - opinion poll lead in eight years. The shallowness of Tony Blair's support, long flagged up by pollsters, has been brutally exposed: where are those not on his payroll who declare passionate admiration for him and Labour? Support is wide but cool. All his early ducking and weaving has left too few ardent devotees. Now pensions and petrol, the dome and disappointment have Labour on the run. Not a bad thing. How pleasingly it sharpened their ideological identity when a genuine blue peril rattled their gates last week. Less big tent, more tribalism gave a new edge and urgency, a welcome definition of Labour's \"irreducible core\". </p> <p>So it was worthwhile trying to be frightened by watching William Hague announced many times a day as \"Our next prime minister!\" But no, he's not going to be. Not in any imaginable circumstance, bar Blair caught with trousers down, hand in till amid economic meltdown. The only four the public have heard of - Hague, Portillo, Widdecombe and Maude - make a gruesome spectacle as holders of the four great offices of state. (It's lucky no one recognises the second rank - and there is no third rank at all.) </p> <p>The truth is that as each new Tory policy unfurls, it becomes ever plainer that even they don't believe a word of it themselves. These people, who only three years ago held high office, managed large budgets and struggled to make policy work in devilish detail on the ground, cannot conceivably imagine that they are about to implement this list of nonsense. Only the No to the euro has the force of conviction: everything else is dressing up, trying on a ragbag of populist clothes. It's all fantasy policy - not what works, but what sounds as if it will. </p> <p>So inner-city tower blocks are to be knocked down, urban deserts made desirable so people no longer flee to the green fields where Tory heartlands are given a new power to veto any building in their back yards to keep them out. More noisy neighbours will be served with far harsher evic tion orders: where will they go? There will be none because the deterrence will work so well. Everyone will get married and stay married with the restoration of the Married Couples Allowance of \u00a3285 a year. It doesn't matter that divorce and extra-marital childbirth soared while this tiny MCA was paid: it's just something plausible to say. Under 30s can opt out of national insurance and put all their money into private pension accounts. What of the \u00a34bn hole that leaves in paying out for today's pensioners each year? No answer. Three pence off the fuel tax - 45p a week on average - just something to say that sounds good for now. Lock up all asylum seekers! What, imprison all 78,000 awaiting adjudication? More than doubling the 65,000 criminals in prison already at \u00a325,000 per prisoner per year? </p> <p> Don't hold your breath for a proper costing of this strange scrapbook of vague ideas. They don't seem to care if no serious person believes in them. If a policy makes a one-day headline, that's all that matters - hit and run without price tag. If pressed, they say they will abolish all Labour's social projects for the poor - things most people have barely heard of starting with the New Deal. The danger is that Labour has so mumbled and undersold its huge social programme that some day it could indeed all be swept away with few but the poor any the wiser. The Blair project has not rooted this grand war on poverty securely enough in the national imagination the way Attlee or Roosevelt did to make it safe for the future, because the prime minister was ambivalent about how it would play in middle England. </p> <p>So far, search as they might in every corner there is no positive Conservative big idea, nothing that flies. Only the negative No-to-Europe stirs real emotion beyond this enclave, but even on this popular ground their vehemence brands them as weird fanatics not wise pragmatists. What other winners have they? The dome, the dome, the dome in every speech from floor and platform, linked to a potentially dangerous slogan: Labour's \"tax and waste\". The dome stands as a sorry emblem of all the billions Labour has spent with still so little to show for it, so many promises yet so little achieved - so far. This line may pack a painful negative punch, yet even so the Tories still lack a big positive idea, a clincher. </p> <p>They yearn for that totem - a practical popular policy that symbolises Conservative freedoms the way Mrs Thatcher's council house sales said it all in 1979. Despite so many populist policies, grasping at every butterfly, none of it resonates with meaning, none of it flies beyond Bournemouth. </p> <p>Some new Tory policies look like a divine gift for Labour. Privatising pensions, privatising the NHS and universities, selling off the welfare state, all these are bound to repel more voters than they will attract at the next election. A malicious mind might suspect Michael Portillo has laid these deliberate traps to prevent any hope of his leader's election. But if he is playing the long game, he might well be cannily right. It should be a salutary warning to Labour that this may be the last chance for the welfare state. If in the next five years after so much money and determination, Labour still does not deliver schools and hospitals that match modern expectations then here is the Portillo agenda for the following election. Failure this time might indeed make privatisation look like the only credible route left to try. </p> <p>Labour's first response to a flicker of life returning to the Tory parrot was auspicious. It made them braver and clearer. We wait to see if that better impulse carries them through to election day, eschewing the directionless populism that will in the end expose William Hague to ridicule by the very people he woos so assiduously. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Three Britons are to follow in the footsteps of Sir Ernest Shackleton's 1916 crossing of the Antarctic island of South Georgia. <p>Next month Jock Wishart, Duncan Nicoll and Jonathan Chastney will cross the island's ice-bound peaks and glaciers, exposed to the same harsh weather conditions in replica Burberry clothing. </p> <p>Shackleton crossed the island in 36 hours at the end of his 18-month attempt to cross Antarctica. His ship, Endurance, became trapped in sea ice and was crushed. For six months Shackleton and his 27-strong crew camped on ice floes. </p> <p>Shackleton and five of the fittest men fought their way in an open boat across 800 miles of ocean to reach South Georgia and get help. </p> <p>After a treacherous journey across the island, he and two of the men reached the Norwegian whaling station at Stromness, where they organised the rescue of the marooned men. </p> <p>All 28 returned home safely, and Shackleton was hailed a national hero. </p> <p>Wishart, 48, who has already rowed the Atlantic and circumnavigated the globe, said: \"This expedition provides me with the opportunity of a lifetime, the chance not only to retrace the great man's steps but to do so enduring similar conditions.\" </p> <p>The three, who have no back-up team, leave the UK on November 20 and are due to return on December 13.</p>"
