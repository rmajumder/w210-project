  "The world's largest national census was launched yesterday as more than 5m volunteers fanned out to take the demographic pulse of a nation of more than 1.2bn people. <p>China's fifth national census seeks to identify the radical changes in Chinese society over the past decade. Births have decreased and people are living longer. The rural population has declined as more peasants seek work in the cities. </p> <p>More people are moving around the country - with or without a residence permit. For the first time, the census will count people where they actually live instead of putting down their registered address. </p> <p>But it is pinning down the exact population of China which remains the crucial objective of the 10-day survey. </p> <p>Officially, China had 1.236bn people at the end of 1997, with population growth thought to be about 13m to 15m a year. Chinese demographers believe that there is persistent undercounting because families conceal \"illegal births\" that breach the official one-child policy. </p> <p>To overcome this, census publicity stresses that information collected \"cannot be used to punish anyone for their past mistakes or population-related matters\". </p> <p>Since the communist victory in 1949, full-scale censuses were carried out in 1953, 1964, 1982 and 1990, with smaller samples in between. </p> <p>Chinese experts say that the quality of census data has fallen, with upwards of 40% of all births not included in some areas. </p> <p>They blame rigid family planning goals and the families trying to avoid being fined for extra births. Local officials are also said to be incompetent or unwilling to report bad news about an excess of births. </p> <p>The 5m census-takers will be backed by another 1m advisers to check recording technique and accuracy. </p> <p>In remote rural areas, some volunteers will have to walk miles to poll households perched on hilltops or isolated in forests. A total of 350m families are expected to be surveyed and answer 23 questions under topics such as income, living conditions, and type and quality of housing. For women, there will be a special focus on details of marriage and childbirth. </p> <p>The hardest task will be to record accurate data on China's migrant workers - thought to number some 60m people, many of whom are working in towns without proper permits and particularly reluctant to take part. </p> <p>As well as undisclosed births, census-takers may discover a few deaths. Officials preparing the census in Wuhan, in central Hubei province, found that nearly 9,000 ex-workers receiving welfare payments were dead. </p> <p>Mass pre-census publicity has included distributing millions of pamphlets, displaying posters and slogans, and even staging amateur dramatics. </p> <p>With pamphlets in Chinese and Tibetan distributed in Tibet's capital, Lhasa, the new system of recording the actual place of residence should, in theory, give a more accurate headcount of Han-Chinese migrants in Tibet and in other large \"national minority\" areas. </p> <p>Beijing says that this census is vital to enable proper planning for the 21st century. But, in order to succeed it will have to overcome long-held suspicions of officials who come to ask questions. </p> <p>The census-takers will have to convince millions of ordinary Chinese that for the first time in decades their personal secrets really are secure.</p>",
  "The imminent end of the Clinton era carries serious foreign policy implications for Britain, particularly if the Republican candidate, George W Bush, is victorious next Tuesday. <p>Tony Blair and New Labour have maintained close links with Bill Clinton and the new Democrats. Some policy ideas, such as the working families tax credit, have been taken straight off Mr Clinton's shelf.</p> <p>The president's emphasis on centrist, inclusive politics has more than an echo in Mr Blair's third way. Mr Clinton's campaigning tactics, and his reliance on focus groups to track public opinion, have been aped by both Labour and the Tories.</p> <p>Mr Blair memorably stuck up for Mr Clinton during a visit to Washington at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Mr Clinton has reciprocated in his tireless support for Mr Blair's efforts to achieve a lasting constitutional settlement in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>By way of contrast, Mr Blair and Mr Bush have never met. Indeed, the Texas governor has only ever made three trips outside the US, apart from visits to Mexico.</p> <p>Al Gore, the Democratic candidate, is a more familiar figure in Britain. But while offering more in the way of policy continuity, even a Gore administration would not be immune to unilateralist or neo-isolationist trends within America - especially if Congress remains under Republican majority control.</p> <p>Mr Bush's ardent support for the deployment of a national missile defence (NMD), designed to protect the US from \"rogue states\", is a prime area of concern for Britain.</p> <p>Although Mr Bush has suggested extending such a missile shield to protect Britain and Europe, NMD is essentially a policy that puts US interests first, risks a new arms race with Russia and China, and potentially undermines the Nato concept of collective security.</p> <p>When Condoleezza Rice, Mr Bush's foreign policy adviser, recently suggested that a Bush administration would pull US troops out of Kosovo and Bosnia, similar concerns were expressed.</p> <p>Such a unilateral pullout would call into question Nato unity of purpose, as well as risking the democratic gains in the Balkans that have been achieved since last year's Kosovo intervention.</p> <p>These considerations only compound existing strains caused by EU efforts to create a separate European defence identity, backed by a nascent European army reserve. Both Mr Gore and Mr Bush have doubts about this project which some in Washington see as a French plot to undermine US influence in Europe.</p> <p>Britain's policy of \"critical engagement\" with problematic regimes, pioneered by foreign secretary Robin Cook, is another source of possible future friction with both Mr Gore and Mr Bush.</p> <p>Britain's attempts to repair diplomatic bridges with Iran, Libya, Cuba and North Korea have often run ahead of US policy.</p> <p>The two countries take very different views of relations with Cuba, for example. The US maintains a strict embargo. Britain is in favour of normalisation and, only this week, sent a trade delegation to Havana led by a junior minister.</p> <p>While Britain is a keen supporter of the United Nations, and especially its international peacekeeping role, Mr Bush is deeply sceptical - while Mr Gore could scarcely be called enthusiastic.</p> <p>Mr Bush argues against unilateral or US military intervention in world troublespots unless justified by overriding US national security interests. He does not, for example, believe that a repeat of the 1994 Rwanda genocide would justify direct US action.</p> <p>Contrast this with Britain's policy in Sierra Leone, where a substantial military commitment has been made in support of the UN peacekeeping force and nation-building.</p> <p>The Clinton-Gore administration refused to get involved there. Both Mr Gore and Mr Bush reject the idea of placing US troops under UN command.</p> <p>The failure of US mediation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will not bring any change in approach from either Mr Gore or Mr Bush.</p> <p>Although many Arab countries believe the US is biased towards Israel, Washington is likely to resist any attempt by Britain or the EU to replace it as the leading peace intermediary.</p> <p>Other areas of potential friction include ongoing US trade disputes with the EU (which have brought sanctions against British exports), the creation of a rule-based trading system that is fair to developing countries, efforts to curb weapons proliferation, the UN's proposed international criminal court, and America's disinclination to fully support international environmental agreements like the Kyoto accord.</p> <p>On all these issues, both Mr Gore and Mr Bush are likely to espouse positions that do not concur with those of Britain.</p> <p>Perhaps most worryingly of all for Mr Blair, the change of leadership in Washington that could lead to a weakening of the \"special relationship\" with the US comes at a time when Britain is also at odds with its EU partners over fundamental questions such as the euro and greater European integration.</p> <p>Which, in a worst case scenario, leaves the United Kingdom all alone in the North Sea, caught between two stools and with declining influence all round.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto: simon.tisdall@theguardian.com\">simon.tisdall@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uselection\">US election</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour//\">Labour in power</a><br></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28simon+tisdall%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=simon+tisdall&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Simon Tisdall</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.open.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">British government</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.firstgov.gov/\" target=\"_new\">US government</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.un.org/\" target=\"_new\">United Nations</a><br> <a href=\" http://europa.eu.int/\" target=\"_new\">European Union</a></p>",
  "Jonathan Steele says no EU government seems willing to acknowledge the demographic need for new immigration (The new migration October 31). This is only partly true. The UK's immigration minister recently set out government thinking on the need for more economic immigration, and the European Commission has long urged member states to make the link between the economic needs of the European Union and non-EU workers. <p>Far from \"radically relaxing its immigration rules\", the UK has made welcome changes to our cumbersome work-permit rules which have long deterred skilled non-EU immigrants from coming to the UK. While this does not amount to a long-term change, there is now genuine scope for EU countries, together and individually, to adopt comprehensive immigration laws which will treat immigrants with greater respect by paying closer attention to areas like family unity policy, so that it is not only their short-term economic impact that is valued. <br><b>Claude Moraes MEP</b> <br><a href=\"mailto:cmoraes@europarl.eu.int\">cmoraes@europarl.eu.int</a> </p> <p>\u0095 I am a well-qualified IT worker born outside the EU.

  "<p>It was a moment when the air was filled with hats and hurrahs. (The decline of the hat has deprived us of several ways of expressing delight and distaste.) </p> <p>In <strong> Josie's Journey</strong> (BBC1) Shaun Russell was coaxing his daughter Josie to attend a garden party in a good cause. He is a man for whom the word noble seems made-to-measure. She is the sole survivor of a murderous attack on her mother and sister. Their headstone is plain Welsh slate. Old roses scattered unregimented petals on the grave. Shaun said \"I chose a simple gravestone, not a fancy one at all. I didn't put much on it either.\" It simply records the names of Lin, Megan and Lucy, the dog killed with them. \"It was beyond me to think of anything more to say.\" </p> <p>Camera and sound backed off as he wept... I sometimes think that a suitable sort of epitaph for a media celebrity would be Fade Sound And Vision, a phrase you see on a shooting script. Josie and Shaun have become, willy-nilly, media celebrities. </p> <p>Which is why they were invited to the garden party. He said \"Josie, listen! They were very good to my dad when he was depressed, before he committed suicide. So your gran thinks it would be nice to do something back for them.\" This was laying it on a bit thick, like the caption in Charlie Chaplin's autobiography: \"This is where we lived next to the abattoir before mother went into the asylum.\" </p> <p>Chaplin exploded into comedy and so, now, did Josie. She said \"Six hours in a car. I'm not going. It's going to be so boring .\" </p> <p>Shaun Russell wore that be-nice-to-me look which would have been irresistible to an older woman. \"Just think how much my mum has done for me.\" \"You go then,\" said Josie. \"I'm not going.\" (\"Parents are difficult...\" she added in a throwaway line to a friend.) </p> <p>It's Shaun's triumph that he's raised a perfectly normal adolescent who shouts \"Yee-ha!\" when he is nervously balanced on a pony and who thinks parents are difficult. </p> <p>We all loved an open-air Dallas wedding. Shaky vows exchanged under the shaky pergola. The bijou pool into which Clive Barnes invariably knocked JR. Astonishingly, it turned out in <strong> Back To The Floor</strong> (BBC2), there really are weddings like this. Many, in the Sandals resort on Antigua. The holiday company's MD Steve Garley went undercover to inspect their wedding operation. </p> <p>Sandals Antigua specialises in package weddings. As Andy and Sharon, a newly arrived pallid pair said, \"It's a bit like Butlins with palms\" (Andy) and, \"It's a conveyor belt\" (Sharon). Steve, a believer in the personal touch, made their day by laying on their favourite drink, chilled Guinness. </p> <p>As a trainee, it was his job to sell couples at least \u00a3350 of those little extras which mean so much. Here he is, failing to interest Martin and Suzanne in a bedroom treat called an escapade: \"There are candles, petals all over the floor of the room and balloons. It's really romantic and the price is about $100.\" </p> <p>The balloons got me. Were you supposed to burst them? And at what point? </p> <p>Steve's failure to flog the escapade got a crisp response from wedding coordinator Ezra. \"Steve, have you any idea what we're supposed to be doing here?\" Less a question than an exclamation. \"What I'd do, I'd get them apart from each other. You have to seem like their best friend, and you want what's best for them. So you say to Martin...\" (her voice took on the tone of a dove asking another dove for the loan of a fiver till Friday) \"...Martin, have you thought of sending Suzanne some flowers?\" </p> <p>Steve gave it a go. \"Martin, don't you think you ought to give Suzanne something for her special day in her room?\" (Such improper overtones that it seemed the ideal moment for Martin to knock Steve into the bijou pool.) \"What do you think about a dozen roses?\" Martin thought he'd think about it. Steve held no grudge against the man. \"Twelve roses for 80 quid! Who's going to buy that? Why don't they sell local tropical flowers?\" </p> <p>At last he wrenched off his whiskers and stood magnificently revealed as managing director of The Rest Of The World. Moral of the series is that nowadays nobody knows what the boss looks like. </p> <p> \"The only acceptable British picnic is whelks with vinegar and pepper, in the car, parked on a seafront somewhere with headscarves on and the windows rolled down.\" Jeremy Round, as quoted by Rick Stein in <strong> Rick Stein's Seafood Lovers' Guide</strong> (BBC 2).</p>",
  "Leaders of nationalist Ireland closed ranks yesterday to defy an attempt by David Trimble to ban Sinn Fein from attending a special cross-border ministerial council set up by the Good Friday agreement. <p>Amid fears that the peace process could be unravelling, the Irish cabinet gave the go-ahead to its health minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin, to join his Sinn Fein counterpart, Bairbre de Br\u00fan, at a meeting of the council tomorrow. </p> <p>Seamus Mallon, the Social Democratic and Labour party deputy first minister in Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive, underlined his fury with the Ulster Unionists by announcing that he would clear his diary to attend the meeting in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh. </p> <p>Mr Trimble last night dismissed the meeting, which is meant to launch a cross-border food safety agency, as a \"face-saving device\" for Sinn Fein. </p> <p>However, the decision of the Irish government and the SDLP to throw their collective weight behind Sinn Fein demonstrates the determination of nationalists to confront the Ulster Unionist leader. Mr Mallon, who decided to attend the meeting after a frosty meeting with Mr Trimble at Stormont yesterday, accused the UUP leader of \"flying in the face\" of the Good Friday agreement. </p> <p>Mr Trimble sparked off the crisis on Saturday when he defeated a challenge from hardline unionists by pledging to ban Sinn Fein ministers from attending meetings of the north-south ministerial council. His move was designed to punish the IRA for its \"failure\" to live up to its commitments on disarmament. </p> <p>Sinn Fein and the Irish government conceded yesterday that tomorrow's meeting would not be a formal meeting of the cross-border council because Mr Trimble, along with Mr Mallon, has the right to veto any minister from attending the body. </p> <p>It will instead be a bilateral meeting which will discuss health issues, ranging from the new food safety agency to a cross-border campaign to warn women who are attempting to become pregnant to take folic acid as a precaution against spina bifida. </p> <p>Ms de Br\u00fan said she was determined to press ahead with the Enniskillen meeting to show that Mr Trimble would not be allowed to \"play party politics\" with health. </p> <p>Her remarks were echoed by Mr Mallon who said he would be attending tomorrow's meeting to protect the \"integrity and operation\" of the cross-border bodies. He also rounded on Mr Trimble for refusing to agree to an emergency meeting of the power-sharing executive to discuss the crisis. </p> <p>\"As it stands, the first minister is vetoing a meeting of one of the institutions - the executive - and vetoing attendance of the responsible minister at another institution, the north-south ministerial council,\" Mr Mallon said. \"This flies in the face of a central element of the Good Friday agreement - that unionists and nationalists will operate these institutions in partnership.\" </p> <p>The Northern Ireland Office declined to comment on the decision to go ahead with tomorrow's meeting, saying that the cross-border body is run by Dublin and by the devolved institutions in Belfast. However, some British sources suggested earlier in the week that it would be unhelpful if Dublin went ahead with the meeting. </p> <p>The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, will use a meeting in London today with the Irish foreign minister, Brian Cowen, to call for a balanced approach to the crisis. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson will tell Mr Cowen that republicans need to reassure unionists by stepping up the disarmament process. Unionists also need to do more to reassure republicans that, if the IRA disarms, they remain committed to all the institutions set up by the Good Friday agreement.</p>",
  "A gay Romanian, who fled his country because of hostility to homosexuals, lost his battle for asylum in the high court yesterday because his treatment fell short of persecution. <p>Gabi Ragman, 25, left Romania for Britain after he was told he had brought shame on the university where he studied and would not be allowed to become a physical education teacher. But \"uncaring and cruel\" treatment suffered by gay people did not necessarily amount to persecution, Mr Justice Scott Baker ruled. </p> <p>To be entitled to refugee status under the 1951 Geneva convention applicants had to show a \"well founded fear of persecution\". The judge rejected Mr Ragman's application for judicial review of an adjudicator's decision last year upholding the home secretary's refusal to grant him asylum. </p> <p>Dismissing the challenge, the judge said Mr Ragman suffered insults and ridicule after it became known that he was homosexual. But the logical conclusion to the argument of his case was that \"all known homosexuals\" from Romania would then be entitled to asylum in the UK. </p> <p>The judge said: \"The right protected by the convention is not a right to practise as a homosexual. It is the right not to suffer persecution for doing so.\" This case demonstrated that there could \"be various degrees of hostility towards homosexuals that nevertheless fall short of persecution\". </p> <p>Mr Ragman, who arrived in the UK in 1998, was regarded as a credible witness on the treatment he had received in Romania, the judge said. His problems arose in his final year at university when it became known that he was homosexual. The university's director called him to the front of an assembly of students and told him that he had brought shame on the institution. </p> <p>It was decided by the college that Mr Ragman could finish his physical education course but would never be allowed to teach because he would be \"a danger to children\". </p> <p>Romanian society was hostile to homosexuals, the judge added, and the public attitude there was that homosexuals were insane. Mr Ragman was insulted every time he left home, in a situation that resembled \"a free theatre\". There was no one to turn to for help. </p> <p>The Romanian government had altered the law to allow homosexual acts between consenting adults in private because the country wanted to join the European Union, but society's attitude did not appear to have changed. </p> <p>The adjudicator had concluded \"with regret\" that the hostility experienced by homosexuals in Romania, \"uncaring and cruel though it is, is not of such a nature and severity as to amount to persecution\". The judge said the court should not interfere with this conclusion.</p>",
  "Fidel Castro called him \"the gentleman policeman\". But Fernando Guti\u00e9rrez Barrios (\"Don Fer\" to his friends), who has died aged 73, had a darker side to his personality. The \"best informed man in Mexico\" - to some the country's very own J Edgar Hoover - Guti\u00e9rrez was \"the man who knew most about the disappeared in this country,\" according to the veteran human rights campaigner Rosario Ibarra. <p>Born in the Caribbean coastal state of Veracruz, Guti\u00e9rrez entered the military academy at an early age and specialised in intelligence work. His father, a businessman, had also been in the army. By 1949 Guti\u00e9rrez had risen to the rank of captain, but the Mexican military - sidelined from politics since the post-revolutionary days - was no career for an ambitious young man. </p> <p>Guti\u00e9rrez left the army and the following year joined the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which under three different names had already run the country for over 20 years, and would do so for another 50, regardless of the true inclinations of the electorate. </p> <p>Not surprisingly perhaps, the new recruit opted to stick to what he knew best, and in 1952 joined the Federal Security Directorate (DFS); in other words, Mexico's political police. His job was to investigate the PRI's opponents, but in 1956 he was called on to interrogate some rather unusual prisoners. Fidel Castro and his 26 July Movement - including Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara - had chosen Mexico as the ideal country in which to train and equip themselves for the overthrow of Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. They were under surveillance not only by the Mexicans but by Batista's intelligence service and the FBI. At the behest of Batista, the group was rounded up and questioned by the DFS, in preparation for what might have been their extradition to Cuba. </p> <p>Details of the deal between Castro's group and the Mexicans remain unclear: Guti\u00e9rrez Barrios took them to his grave, and few other witnesses remain. But it is apparent that the Mexican intelligence agent and the Cuban revolutionary struck up a warm relationship which was to last the rest of Guti\u00e9rrez's life. </p> <p>\"He was a kind and gentlemanly policeman who conversed agreeably and even had some leftist ideas,\" Fidel would later say. Guti\u00e9rrez, for his part, said he never regarded Castro as a criminal, but a young man with ideals who planned to overthrow a dictator. The Cubans were released and went on to win their revolutionary war. </p> <p>Guti\u00e9rrez visited Havana on many occasions, and when Castro attended the 1988 inauguration of President Carlos Salinas, he was personally attended by his former jailer. The two men even travelled to Tuxpan, in Veracruz, for a memorial ceremony at the spot where the revolutionaries embarked for their voyage to Cuba. </p> <p>Back in Mexico, however, homegrown revolutionaries were unwelcome. Although the DFS and Guti\u00e9rrez gave a good deal of help over the years to leftist movements from elsewhere in the continent, they mercilessly repressed the Mexican left that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. </p> <p>In 1968, when security forces gunned down hundreds of unarmed demonstrators just prior to the Mexico City Olympics, Guti\u00e9rrez was director of the DFS. He then rose to under-secretary of the interior - retaining control of the political police - during the \"dirty war\" period of the 1970s, which left more than 500 disappeared prisoners whose fate remains unknown. </p> <p>\"What Fidel Castro saw as a friendly hand,\" said Rosario Ibarra, \"was the hand of repression in this country. And death does not change a person's deeds.\" The DFS at that time ran a death squad known as the Brigada Blanca (White Brigade), whose activities were every bit as sinister as its counterparts in Central and South America. The difference is that in Mexico the truth about the period has yet to be publicly revealed. Guti\u00e9rrez Barrios, perhaps the most tight-lipped political figure in Mexico, knew all of it and never said a word. </p> <p>His discretion and loyalty were rewarded with ever more senior positions. From 1986-88 he was governor of his home state of Veracruz, and when Carlos Salinas became president he appointed Guti\u00e9rrez interior minister. In 1993, however, as the time approached for him to nominate a successor, Salinas unceremoniously dumped him as minister in favour of the governor of Chiapas. </p> <p>Guti\u00e9rrez, who in any event belonged to the \"dinosaur\" wing of the PRI from which the technocrat Salinas was attempting to distance himself, had committed the unpardonable sin of considering himself \"presidenciable\". His dismissal led to a period in the political wilderness. </p> <p>Politics, however, was his life, and under Salinas's successor, Ernesto Zedillo, he staged a comeback. He was invited to run the PRI's first primary election (as perhaps the only man capable of keeping all the rival candidates under control) and stood for federal senator. On September 1, he was sworn in as a member of the upper house. Ironically, his unexpected death from a heart attack coincided with the removal from power of the PRI, which governed Mexico for virtually the span of his life. </p> <p>Guti\u00e9rrez leaves a wife and four children. </p> <p> <b>Fernando Guti\u00e9rrez Barrios, secret policeman and politician, born October 26 1927; died October 30 2000.</b></p>"
