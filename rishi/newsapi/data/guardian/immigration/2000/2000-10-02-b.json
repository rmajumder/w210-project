[
  "In April 1993, soon after moving to the Middle East, I visited the flyblown Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, then under Israeli military rule. There I had my first shocking insight into the brutal reality of the occupation. <p>It was the fag-end of the Intifada, the Palestinian popular rising, and although the mass riots had died down, military patrols and installations were still being regularly stoned and petrol bombed by Arab youths and schoolchildren. I saw none of that in Bureij. What I saw was much more disturbing. </p> <p>I was in a United Nations health centre when the first shot was fired. It was a single round, the first of maybe a score of single high-velocity rounds, fired every few minutes: the distinctive pattern of aimed sniper fire. The first casualty they dragged into the UN clinic was a young man, spouting blood. The second was a little boy, no more than ten years old, whimpering for his mum. </p> <p>Over the next 75 minutes or so, they brought six more casualties into that drab little clinic. All had bullet wounds. It may be that they had chucked stones at the Israeli rooftop observation posts in the camp, though I saw no evidence of it. </p> <p>One of the youths shot that morning died the next day in hospital. He became another statistic in the blood soaked saga of the occupation; one more reason for the frantic peace negotiations which even then, unknown to any of us, were under way in Oslo. </p> <p>The peace accord was supposed to end the occupation, and the casual, terrible brutality which went with it. The brutality, of course, was not one-sided. A few weeks before that depressing visit to Bureij, I was in another Gaza camp, listening to a Palestinian bragging about the \"good deed\" done that week by his 19-year-old brother. </p> <p>Ziyad Salim Silmi's \"good deed' was to travel to Tel Aviv, a few miles up the coast, and stab 10 Jews with a commando knife. Two of his victims died. </p> <p>Silmi, it seems, was a loner. He survived a savage beating by enraged Israelis, unlike other youths who strapped explosives to their bodies and blew themselves to bits in crowded buses. </p> <p>Madness and badness were mingled in the occupation. They still are, for the occupation goes on in parts of the Gaza Strip and most of the West Bank. So too does the crazy imbalance of fire power. </p> <p>The Israeli Defence Forces - in pedantic theory there is no army - are among the best equipped and trained in the world. They have elaborate surveillance devices, well-honed intelligence networks, and of course the best weaponry that US dollars can buy. Even now, they are deploying tanks in the West Bank to defend Jewish settlements. </p> <p>Back in 1993, the Palestinians had stones and slings, petrol bombs and a pathetic armoury of smuggled firearms and home made bombs. Now, they have their own army, but it is a ragtag affair without armour or heavy guns. </p> <p>But the Palestinians have a none-too-secret weapon: their burning anger. Their fury is almost tangible, though it is not always incoherent. It comes boiling to the surface when old folk talk of their lost homes and farms, when young men speak of their daily humiliations at checkpoints, and when schoolchildren grab stones and charge into the most appalling danger. </p> <p>Now the anger is erupting again. Ostensibly, it is about the shockingly provocative visit last week by Ariel Sharon, rightwing politician and ex-general, to Jerusalem's Haram as-Sharif, which Jews call the Temple Mount. Sharon knew what he was doing, though he may not have guessed the scale of the reaction. </p> <p>So now the battle is rejoined: stones, firebombs and Kaleshnikovs on one side, and the Middle East's most formidable army on the other. The death toll is 33 and rising. Two dead Israelis and the rest Arabs; about par for the course of the world's most lopsided conflict. </p> <p>Useful links: <a href=\"http://www.idf.il/english/news/main.htm\" target=\"_new\">Israeli Defence Forces</a> <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post</a> <a href=\"http://www.haaretzdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Ha'aretz daily</a> <a href=\"http://www.jrep.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Report news magazine</a> <a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/index_e.htm\" target=\"_new\">Palestine Information Centre</a> <a href=\"http://www.arab.net/palestine/history/pe_plo.html\" target=\"_new\"> Palestine Liberation Organisation</a> <a href=\"http://www.pna.net\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian National Authority</a></p>",
  "From their concrete fortress the Israeli gunners who inflicted the death that has become the symbol of these days of blood and rage, opened up with anti-tank missiles yesterday - blasting away hopes of an end to violence in the Middle East. <p>By nightfall, the toll from four days of rioting across the West Bank and Gaza stood at 28 dead, and more than 700 wounded. The battle for Jerusalem - as the Palestinians call these clashes - had racked up the worst violence in four years, and made a martyr of a 12-year-old boy. </p> <p>Outside the Israeli command post at Netzarim junction, where Rami al-Dirreh, 12, spent the last terrifying moments of his life on Saturday, the renewed demand for a ceasefire by Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, was met with derision yesterday. </p> <p>Two more Palestinians were killed at the junction yesterday, and more than 40 injured. Amid angry recrimination between Mr Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, the violence is spreading. Yesterday, clashes erupted for the first time in Israel proper. </p> <p>\"A ceasefire? How can you have a ceasefire between stones and guns. It's a big joke,\" said Brigadier-General Osama al-Ali, who is in charge of security cooperation between Palestinian and Israeli forces. \"The only possibility for ceasefire is to remove a military camp from our territory. They must take their boot off our heads.\" </p> <p>By yesterday afternoon, every Palestinian in Gaza appeared to have seen the sickening television footage of Rami's death. Hit by four bullets, he collapsed in his father's arms on Saturday, after cowering behind a concrete water butt during a gun battle between the Israelis in their armoured watchtowers and Palestinian youths. </p> <p>His father, who was hit by eight bullets, had waved desperately at the Israelis on the other side of the junction to let his son live. But the 15 craters in the patch of wall where they were trapped make it plain that the Israelis directed their machine guns on the pair. Rami became their target. </p> <p>So did the ambulance driver who was shot dead when he tried to reach the boy. \"There was still some breath left in him when we reached the ambulance, but when we opened the doors, they started shooting again,\" Bassam al-Bilbays, who was riding with the medic, said. </p> <p>Which is why a day later, Gen Ali was in no mood to heed Israeli demands for a ceasefire. When the Palestinian rioters began to gather, taunting the soldiers until they exchanged rubber bullets for live rounds, he was railing against the mere presence of Israeli forces in \"the belly of Palestine\". </p> <p>The fortress, which guards the approach to the Jewish settlement of Netzarim, in the middle of Gaza, is a symbol for the frustrations of Palestinian self-rule, and a regular source of friction. A soldier was killed here last week, a prelude to the explosion of fury that followed Thursday's visit to a sacred Muslim site by the hardline Israeli leader Ariel Sharon. </p> <p>Palestinians saw his visit as a symbol of Israel's claims to their holiest shrine, the Haram al-Sharif, where the Prophet Mohammed rode to heaven. They see the fortress at Netzarim as a symbol of the fact that there is no sign of peace, or of a Palestinian state. </p> <p>\"We see our kids dying and we can not help them,\" Gen Ali raged. \"They [the Israelis] are terrorists. Even though they are wearing army uniforms, that is exactly what they are.\" </p> <p>The protests have cast a powerful spell on the young. Yesterday children as young as six and eight set up roadblocks of burning tyres on roads in Gaza. </p> <p>A few days ago, in Rami's breeze block and corrugated tin-roofed home in the Bourij refugee camp, he was mesmerised by footage of the riots on television. \"When he saw what happened in Jerusalem on TV, he asked me: 'Can I go to join the protests in Net zarim?' I did not dare to answer him. I did not want him to go,\" said his mother, Amal. </p> <p>Death sought Rami out anyway; the boy was killed as he returned from a shopping trip to Gaza, where he and his father had looked at a used car. </p> <p>In Bourij, where nearly all of the houses have a photograph of the Dome of the Rock, they are calling Rami a martyr for Jerusalem. His mother is afraid to tell her five younger children how he died - in case they fall under the martyr's spell. \"Nothing good will come of this. We will have many more martyrs, and nothing will change,\" she said. </p> <p>And the dead will be even younger than Rami. Among those killed yesterday was a 10-year-old boy, shot dead by Israeli helicopter gunships near a Jewish enclave in the West Bank city of Nablus. Fighting raged too in the West Bank cities of Ramallah and Hebron, and in Jerusalem security forces evacuated Jews from their holiest shrine, the Western Wall, because of tension. </p> <p>Most worrying for Mr Barak was the spread of the violence to Israel proper yesterday. In Nazareth, hundreds of masked youths threw stones at Israeli police near the spot where the angel Gabriel is believed to have foretold the birth of Jesus. One Israeli Arab was killed and dozens injured in clashes in the northern town of Umm al-Fahim. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Mr Barak was adamant that it fell to the Palestinian forces - and to Mr Arafat - to end the violence. \"Absence of such activity may bring about an escalation,\" a statement from his office said. He repeated Israel's claim that it only fired on protesters when the lives of soldiers and civilians were endangered. </p> <p>In reply, Mr Arafat demanded that Israel first withdraw its forces from the entrances of Palestinian towns, and stop firing on his people. He threatened to take several \"measures\" if Israel did not stop the bloodshed in 24 hours, including an appeal to the UN security council. </p> <p>The fighting talk from both men comes despite the personal intervention of President Bill Clinton, who called on both sides to cool tempers.</p>",
  "<p>Movie fans the world over held their breath yesterday following a report in the Sunday Express that Geri Halliwell's planned new movie has been put on ice. </p> <p>Production company September Films, the newspaper reports, has failed to raise its $10.3m budget, and the project has been shelved - indefinitely. The movie was to have seen Halliwell in her first starring role, as a patient who has an affair with her therapist. </p> <p>However, Halliwell's spokesman today moved to deny these reports, and insisted that the movie, which goes under the working title of Therapy, will go ahead, blaming the delays on script reworkings.</p> <p>\"Geri is really excited about the project,\" he said.

  "<p>Surely, I found myself wondering as I watched the 46th off-the-shoulder batwing jersey top sashay down the catwalk last week, it is supposed to be the new, young, edgy designers who challenge the status quo, throw fresh ideas into the mix. So why are these the very designers belting their little hearts out as one from the Now That's What I Call the 80s songbook, leaving it to the older kids on the block to cheer us up with something that we could reasonably wear for spring/summer 2001, rather than for a Duran Duran concert? </p> <p>It's not hard to see why the 80s are so fascinating for a designer trying to make a statement and make their name. A dalliance with the uncomfortable, with the boundaries of taste and the definition of beauty, is central to cutting-edge fashion. This is what 80s revivalism is all about: the style of the decade is still too close, too embarrassing, to make comfortable viewing, which is what makes it abrasive and difficult. The trouble with multiple variations on the theme, however, is that the shock value fades, while the ugliness remains. </p> <p>But if too many collections were scented with the era of Poison and Giorgio Beverly Hills, there were also some very good ones. Markus Lupfer and Marcus Constable infused their collections with a clarity of vision that shone through in the colours, the tailoring, even in the way the models walked - somehow a designer's clarity of thought shines through in the catwalk presence of the models. Lupfer showed his skill with skirts of harlequin-patterned feathers and of ribboned leather, and a new half-batwing sleeve shape: kimono-style from the front, batwing from the back. This collection was strong enough to satisfy the critics, confident enough to convince American buyers. Marcus Constable's electric blues, fire-engine reds and banana yellows made up one of the most stunning palettes of the week, while his exquisite shapes, unusually for a designer considered leftfield, have a Valentino quality, sexy and flattering. </p> <p>With bright white and graffiti-influenced fluorescent prints, Luella produced a collection that was hard-edged but upbeat. Short, broad-shouldered jackets took on matador proportions, while \"LB\" logo pelmet skirts and tight bright jeans look destined for sellout status. Emma Cook had some beautiful pieces - a coral silk trumpet-sleeved blouse, a green backless dress garlanded with green suede flowers - but the batwings and droopy jersey urchin skirts were a little drab, as were Sophia Kokosalaki's drop-waisted skirts and flat boots with tight trousers, although Kokosalaki's chevronned leather pencil skirt was perfect. Both collections had perhaps too many echoes of Nicholas Ghesquiere's draped-jersey designs. </p> <p>Boudicca have a reputation for being the most cerebral of designers. This collection had some interesting ideas, such as the batwing sleeves that tied apron-style at the back of a dress, but the 10 different linen blouses printed with stars, wiggles, crosses and circles were less than enthralling. Tristan Webber gave us the kind of collection that could only happen in London, full of pervy surgical fetish motifs: thigh-high red latex leggings over high heels and a black leather neck brace. The less weird pieces, like a red leather miniskirt with indents in the waistband to hook your thumbs into, were the sexiest; it would have been a treat to have more of the painted velvet dresses and capes, which were beautiful. Even Clements Ribeiro, producer of some of the most glorious London collections of the past few years, were sucked into the 80s vortex. They showed some of the most desirable trousers of the week, but the bottle-green one-sleeved tops and hole-punched red and black leather, while slotting neatly into the prevailing trend, were a departure and felt as if the designers' hearts weren't quite in them. </p> <p>The star collection of the week came from Alexander McQueen, who fashioned showpiece dresses from the shells of razor clams and mussels, but also produced some of his prettiest, most commercial pieces ever, suits and simple dresses in shadow shades of palest ice blue and rose pink. The scope of his vision was matched only by that of Hussein Chalayan, who showed a fiercely modern floral print made of computer-generated poppies and fired the final shots of the week from a space-age set that featured an animated video and models shattering their dresses with ice picks. </p> <p>Julien Macdonald has a more straightforward but equally reliable method of getting attention: celebrity models and bare breasts. Not for nothing is Macdonald termed Britain's answer to Donatella Versace - his clothes broadcast sex appeal at ghetto-blaster volume - but Elspeth Gibson also seemed to be having a Donatella moment, showing her sauciest collection yet. Gauzy chiffon mini-kaftans over bikinis with high strappy gold sandals were just right for Jerry Hall, while slinky black trousers were slit from waist to ankle. It was all done with humour and a light touch: a camel cardigan was embroidered with a leopard, complete with feather-boa tail; an itsy-bitsy miniskirt had \"EG\" picked out in pearls on the back. </p> <p>The gold, white and black strappy shoes and high boots made by Jimmy Choo for Gibson compete for shoes of the week with the Aubrey Beardsley print ankle straps at Liberty, also by Choo. Liberty looked strong this season, with gorgeous prints featuring on everything from minuscule sequin shorts to palazzo pants, and tiered in an indulgent hippy-chick long skirt. The Boyd show was buoyantly commercial and slick, but the candy stripes and peach rah-rah skirts were almost a little too sugar-sweet; much stronger were the pieces which showed a little edge, like the abstract starfish prints and Bognor, Margate and Newquay T-shirts. There were some highly desirable pieces, too, at Sheila Maloney (curved-hem ice-cream-coloured skirts with an underskirt of watery black sequins), Betty Jackson (a vintage-look rose-embroidered sheer white net blouse edged with ribbon), and Nicole Farhi (neat pleated tennis-style minis). </p> <p>One of the highlights of the week was the return to form of Matthew Williamson. Williamson's skill as a colourist can make his shows a joy: diagonal stripes of nostalgic seaside pastels, knits in lime and rose, a silky camouflage-pattern camisole in shades of the sky. Hold on in there folks: maybe there is light at the end of the batwing tunnel after all.</p>",
  "<p>With winds of nearly 135mph, Hurricane Keith buffeted the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico yesterday, with heavy rains stretching to Belize, Honduras and Nicaragua. </p> <p>Mexican officials were evacuating 5,000 people from low-lying areas around Chetumal, a city of 250,000 on the border with Belize. Many of the abandoned homes were shacks made of wooden slats and cardboard. </p> <p>Forecasters warned of possible flash floods and mud slides, although the slow-moving hurricane was expected to weaken as it drifted further inland. </p> <p>A hurricane warning was in effect along the Yucatan peninsula's eastern shore, from Cabo Catoche south to Monkey River Town, Belize, according to the national hurricane centre in Miami. A hurricane watch remained in effect for the Yucatan's northern coast from west of Cabo Catoche to Progreso. </p> <p>Emergency teams from the Yucatan to Costa Rica were on alert in low-lying areas at risk for flooding and mountainous zones where there was a possibility of landslides. The Mexican army and civil protection officials set up shelters and called for evacuations in flood-prone areas. </p> <p>The authorities in Honduras blamed bad weather for the disappearance of a helicopter carrying the country's chief justice and five others near the northern coast on Friday. The aircraft disappeared from the radar screens shortly after takeoff. </p> <p>In Washington, the US state department said that Americans should consider leaving Belize because of flooding from Hurricane Keith. </p> <p>In a travel warning, the state department said the hurricane had caused extensive flooding in Belize. It urged US citizens to stay in contact with the U.S. embassy \"and consider departing the country as soon as it is safe to do so\".</p>",
  "Austria's populist firebrand, J\u00f6rg Haider, taunted EU governments yesterday by appearing at an annual reunion of SS veterans and Hitler's other soldiers shortly after Brussels ended seven months of diplomatic sanctions against his country. <p>The de facto leader of the anti-immigration Freedom party (FPO), which shares government with the conservative People's party (OVP), hit back at Vienna's 14 EU partners for attempting to isolate Austria because of his rightwing views. </p> <p>The experience of Austrians in rebuilding postwar Europe had given the country the strength to stand up and fight the \"unjust\" sanctions, said Mr Haider, who is governor of the southern province of Carinthia. </p> <p>\"The future democracy is decided by the people and not by a handful of various self-declared European leaders,\" he said in what was widely interpreted as an indirect dig at France, Germany and Belgium. </p> <p>The sanctions were lifted last month after a report by a group of European experts, dubbed the \"three wise men\", concluded that the sanctions were \"counter-productive\" because they turned Austrians against Europe and into the arms of Mr Haider. </p> <p>Mr Haider said of the gathering of veterans: \"Those who come to Ulrichsberg are not the old Nazis. They are not neo-Nazis, they are not criminals.\" </p> <p>But Peter Timm managed to make the strenuous mountain pilgrimage, paying \u00a32.50 for entry to the annual gathering to commemorate the deaths of Hitler's soldiers. The 79-year old former Waffen SS officer travelled to Carinthia from his home in Rheinland-Pfalz, in Germany. </p> <p>\"This is my 40th time,\" he said. \"It gets harder every year, but only death will keep me away.\" The sentiment was largely shared by more than 2,000 of his former colleagues from the SS and Wehrmacht, members of sympathy groups from Italy, France and Hungary, and the Burschenschaften - young and uniformed rightwing fraternities. </p> <p>Mr Timm and his colleagues spoke with enthusiasm about their time spent fighting on the Russian front for Hitler. The SS death's head signet ring Mr Timm still wears, he explained with ease, was an award, along with an iron cross, for the part he played in the Nazis' brutal suppression of the Warsaw uprising. </p> <p>\"We fought for Germany, not for the SS, and I had no choice - that's why Europe's free today,\" he added before three skinhead youths from the German state of Saxony suddenly tried to extricate him from the media glare. </p> <p>For Mr Haider, who was elected as governor of Carinthia last February with 42% of the vote, this year's event was supposed to be a chance for him to clean up his act. The speech he made five years ago to SS veterans at Ulrichsberg caused an international outcry after he praised the former members of Hitler's voluntary army as \"men of character\". </p> <p>Speaking yesterday against the backdrop of a huge steel and concrete crucifix, he defended Austria from criticism by the outside world that it had done little to fight its Nazi past. </p> <p>\"It can't be so that the history of our fathers and grandparents, due to dubious commentaries, is reduced to a single catalogue of crimes, and that the part they played in history is just thrown back in their faces,\" he said to great applause. </p> <p>Willi Stelzhammer, of the human rights pressure group SOS Mitmensch, whose members milled among the crowds along with a handful of anti-Nazi observers, said: \"This was clearly a cleverly-constructed event by Haider to convince the world that Austria is more tolerant.\" </p> <p>An attempt by opponents to disrupt the meeting by flying over the scene in a helicopter blaring Wagner music flopped after a tabloid newspaper exposed the plan, prompting the helicopter company to cancel the flight. </p> <p>Drinking a schnapps with his neo-Nazi fans, Mr Timm said he was satisfied. \"He's the only one we've got,\" he said of Mr Haider, his hands trembling as he lit a cigarette with a lighter bearing the slogan of the rightwing extremist German National party (NPD). </p> <p>\"I only wish he had a doppelg\u00e4nger so that we could have a Haider in Germany.\"</p>",
  "Howard Winstone, the former world featherweight champion from Wales, who has died aged 61, was one of the most talented boxers ever to grace a British ring. He would have enjoyed greater success but for the great Mexican Vicente Saldivar, who dominated the world 9-stone division in the mid-1960s. <p>Although Winstone ultimately captured the World Boxing Council version of the belt with a ninth-round stoppage of Japan's Mitsunori Seki at the Royal Albert Hall on January 23 1968, he was already past his peak, evidently drained by three savage encounters with Saldivar. Their trilogy produced some of the most breathtaking action ever seen in the division and, for all Winstone's courage and determination, the legendary champion emerged on top each time. </p> <p>On two occasions, the Welshman's outstanding left hand and immaculate skills brought him to the cusp of victory, only for Saldivar's extraordinary stamina to sway the verdict in the closing rounds. Had they fought under modern rules over 12 rounds, Winstone's exquisite ringcraft and unquenchable spirit might well have prevailed. Instead, Saldivar's finishing flourish twice proved decisive over the traditional distance of 15 rounds. On the third occasion they met, in Mexico City in October 14 1967, Winstone, awash with personal problems, was stopped in the 12th. </p> <p>Born in Merthyr Tydfil, Winstone developed an early taste for boxing, although there had been no tradition of the sport in his family. He was fired by the ring exploits of Merthyr fighter Eddie Thomas, the former British and European welterweight champion (and later Winstone's manager), and proved an outstanding schoolboy fighter for Dowlais ABC. </p> <p>Winstone crowned a successful amateur career by winning a gold medal at the 1958 Empire Games in Cardiff, despite having lost the tips of three fingers on his right hand in a factory accident. Some boxing insiders felt his inability to make a fist actually allowed him to hit harder. </p> <p>Married at 17 and a father soon afterwards, he abandoned his dream of competing at the Rome Olympics of 1960 to turn professional under Thomas. \"I married very young and I needed the money,\" he once said. \"It's as simple as that.\" </p> <p>Recognising Winstone's huge potential, Thomas impressed on him his doctrine of \"science over slugging\". The fact that Winstone stopped just 27 of his 61 professional victims testifies to his modest punching power. He relied on strength, guile, workrate and body shots, allied to an outstanding technique, and lost just six of 67 paid contests. </p> <p>Turning professional at 20, Winstone fought his way up the rankings, before winning the British title, following \"the battle of the golden boys\" with Londoner Terry Spinks, whose will was broken in the 10th by an array of ferocious body shots at Wembley Pool on May 2 1961. </p> <p>Winstone's unbeaten 34-fight streak ended with a shock second-round stoppage defeat against American Leroy Jeffrey, but Thomas cannily ensured that he regained his confidence by defending his British title three times, prior to winning the European crown from Italy's Alberto Serti at the Maindy stadium, Cardiff, on July 9 1963. </p> <p>The mid-1960s saw Winstone at his best. Although a world-title shot against Cuba's Sugar Ramos proved frustratingly elusive, a crowd of 15,000 saw him retain his European crown against Frenchman Yves Desmarets in Rome. He then challenged Saldivar, the new champion, for the world crown at Earl's Court on September 7 1965. There, on a night of blistering Welsh passion, Winstone's greatest display looked certain to ensure victory, until Saldivar's sterling comeback over the last three rounds narrowly stole the verdict. </p> <p>The pair met again at Ninian Park, Cardiff, two years later, and, although Winstone produced another superb performance, Saldivar was again adjudged to have come out on top. Thomas vented his fury, but Winstone remained philosophical. \"On points, I felt I couldn't lose, but I lost anyway,\" he said. \"No, I'm not bitter. Even if I was, it wouldn't change the decision.\" </p> <p>By the time of his third fight with Saldivar, Winstone's marriage to Benita was failing, and she eventually left him for another man: she \"could not stand the lonely and frustrating life of the wife of a professional boxer\". He later found happiness with his second wife, Bronwen. </p> <p>Although Winstone ultimately realised his ambition of becoming world champion, by beating Seki to claim the WBC title, success had arrived too late. After losing the belt to Cuban exile Jose Legra on a fifth-round stoppage at Porthcawl in July 24 1968 - a fight conducted in an eerie, funereal silence - he never fought again. </p> <p>Like so many in his profession, the Welshman's later years were difficult. He briefly ran a cafe in Merthyr, and subsequently a public house in Aberdare, neither venture proving successful. Exceedingly popular at boxing reunions, Winstone could not help wistfully comparing the ring earnings of today's top fighters with his own modest pay. He was perpetually dogged by ill health and money problems. </p> <p>Nevertheless, in the words of the late boxing sage Harry Mullan: \"If you judge a man's worth by the number of his friends and admirers rather than his bank balance, Winstone is a millionaire.\" </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, four sons and two daughters. </p> <p>\u0095 Howard Winstone, boxer, born April 15 1939; died September 30 2000</p>",

We should restate the principle of universal benefits, index-linked to prices or earnings, whichever rises more. <p>Sadly, this government's spokespersons do not now apply this to pensions. The contribution of older people - and older Labour policies - should not be written out of history. They are still relevant today.<br> <b>John Nicholson</b><br> Chief executive, UK Public Health Association <a href=\"mailto:john@ukpha.org.uk\">john@ukpha.org.uk</a> </p> <p>\u0095 Tom Kenny (Letters, September 30) expresses astonishment that the police have no arrangement with the immigration services to deport criminals. </p> <p>In fact, provided that the police or crown prosecution service remember to serve the correct notice, criminal courts have the power to recommend that an overseas national be deported as part of the sentence for most offences. The recommendation is then passed to the Home Office for action. </p> <p>What Kenny does not explain is why his non-British burglar should face additional penalties in comparison to a similar British criminal.<br> <b>Paul Ward</b><br> Brighton <a href=\"mailto:PaulWard123@aol.com\">PaulWard123@aol.com</a></p>",

  "The Tory leader, William Hague, was yesterday roundly attacked by both right and left of the party for paying too much attention to focus groups and for abandoning policies in favour of cheap populist tactics. <p>Before the party conference at Bournemouth even officially started, the pro-European former Northern Ireland spokesman Ian Taylor accused the party of \"picking policies off the shelf\" and \"just reacting to the latest tabloid headlines\".</p> <p>From the opposite wing, the former Foreign Office minister David Davis warned his leader to concentrate on \"powerful beliefs\" rather than \"corrosive\" populism.</p> <p>The two-pronged attack came at a Guardian debate, Have the Tories let populism overshadow policy? Mr Hague was denounced for failing to reveal a consistent framework of policies and being scared of expressing the party's principles for fear of losing popularity. Mr Taylor, who resigned from the front bench over Europe three years ago, criticised the Opposition's handling of a raft of issues including the Tony Martin case, asylum seekers, Europe, pensions, gay rights and the fuel crisis.</p> <p>On the case of Martin, the farmer jailed for life after shooting dead a young burglar in his home, Mr Taylor said: \"There were some serious issues, but in the way it was raised the Tory party was seen as gung-ho about people shooting burglars in the back.\"</p> <p>When it came to the euro, he said the party responded with the Save the Pound lorry trip, \"a gut reaction \u0085not an intelligent contribution\".</p> <p>On fuel, he said the shadow chancellor Michael Portillo's pledge to cut 3p off a litre of petrol was the \"most populist of cuts\", while on pensions \"we seem to be playing tit for tat with Labour\".</p> <p>Mr Taylor said the party should establish a \"framework of principles and policies.\" There was a danger that by only reacting to the latest tabloid headlines the public would become \"cynical and suspicious about what we're doing\".</p> <p>He said he no longer believed the prime minister to be \"vacuous\" and praised him for his firm stance on fuel and pensions at the Labour party conference last week, urging Mr Hague to \"learn and listen\" from Mr Blair's \"standing firm and showing leadership''.</p> <p>He urged the party: \"Let's get away from tabloid demands for a tongue sarnie between William Hague and Ffion on the stage. Let's try to portray ourselves as a party that's not distracted by\u0085 buffoonery.\"</p> <p>His attack was less surprising than that of the rightwing chairman of the public accounts committee, Mr Davis, who urged his leader not \"to subordinate our basic beliefs to the findings of focus groups and the imperatives of opinion polls. It is utterly wrong and incredibly dangerous''.</p> <p>Pointing out that Margaret Thatcher had never consulted a focus group, he spoke of his concern that the party was listening too much to these groups \"rather than our own principles in failing to challenge government policies\".</p> <p>He warned: \"If we allow populism, the focus group, the opinion poll, to triumph over our principles, we are allowing the Labour party to do what they want, to create a principle-free zone in politics.\"</p>"
