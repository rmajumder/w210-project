  "<p> Burger King has poached Philip Almond, brand director of Smirnoff, to be its marketing director for the UK and Ireland.</p> <p>Almond replaces Lorraine Thompson, who left the Diageo-owned company in June to join the internet portal, Excite, as European marketing director. He has spent the past five years working in senior marketing roles for UDV UK, also part of Diageo, most recently as brand director for Smirnoff. </p> <p>Almond was responsible for the \"No Imperfections\" advertising campaign for Smirnoff Red, and recently oversaw the launch of Smirnoff Ice. He joins on November 1 and will report to Andre Lacroix, Burger King's president for Europe, the middle east and Africa.</p> <p>Diageo recently announced plans for a partial flotation of Burger King in New York. The decision followed moves by Burger King franchisees to organise a buyout after complaining about a lack of investment in the fast food chain from Diageo.</p>",
  "<p>Australia has a secret weapon in the war against fake merchandise at this year's Olympics - saliva. A leading athlete, as yet unnamed, has donated DNA which has been incorporated into special ink to be used in all official products sold at the Sydney Games. Officials will be able instantly to identify genuine products from counterfeit by using a handheld scanner.</p> <p>Unfortunately for the rest of us, spotting a fake is not always so easy.</p> <p>Counterfeit products from sportswear to perfume, toys to designer handbags - even Pok\u00e9mon cards - have flooded the world market. The Global Anti-Counterfeiting Group, which represents the interests of brand owners around the world, estimates that fakes are now a \u00a3250bn industry.</p> <p>While the Prada handbag bought from a street hawker in Italy or the dodgy Gucci watch picked up for a song in Bangkok is an obvious fake and carries its own kind of kitsch value, it is becoming harder to tell fakes from the real thing.</p> <p>\"There are some pretty good fakes out there,\" says Ed Chicken, vice chairman of the Institute of Trading Standards.</p> <p>Fraudsters usually attend trade fairs to identify the latest branded products. They then copy them and churn them out so quickly in developing world sweatshops that counterfeits are often available before the genuine article gets into the shops.</p> <p>\"Many manufacturers build special stitching patterns into clothing or use holographic labels to protect their brands, but it's not something that the general public would necessarily recognise,\" says Chicken.</p> <p>Most fakes are sold at street markets and car boot sales, but some products, particularly clothing, may make it into high street stores. The internet is a growing source of fake products.</p> <p>According to the Cosmetic and Perfumery Retailers' Association, there are around 160 websites offering \"genuine\" Chanel products, despite the fact that Chanel doesn't sell any of its products on the net. While it's obvious that the designer perfume you buy for a fiver from a man on the pavement in Oxford Street is likely to be nothing more than coloured water, websites often look authentic.</p> <p>Paul Carratu, managing director of Carratu International, a company which investigates fake products on behalf of brand owners, says: \"There are more and more counterfeit products being sold over the internet. Some are cut price and look like bargains because they are claimed to be imports or last season's products. Other sites sell fake products at full price as if they're genuine. It's only when you get it - if it ever arrives - that you realise it's a fake.\"</p> <p>Part of the problem is that consumers don't look closely enough at \"official\" websites. Research carried out by security firm ArmorGroup showed that 91% of consumers couldn't tell a fake Visa logo from the real thing.</p> <p>Howard Cottrell, executive director of ArmorGroup, says: \"With its ease of access, massive audience and potential for anonymity, the internet provides an ideal platform for counterfeiters.\"</p> <p>Brand owners claim they are losing a fortune to fraudsters. To combat the problem, many companies have anti-fraud squads or use the services of firms such as Carratu and ArmorGroup which go undercover to trace fakes and identify the culprits.</p> <p>Manchester United's anti-fraud team has seized fake replica shirts worth more than \u00a32m and other merchandise during the past three years and the luxury goods company Louis Vuitton says that, in Japan, it is losing in excess of 5bn yen (\u00a331m) a year to fraudsters.</p> <p>It is not only money the company is afraid of losing, but cachet. If fake Louis Vuitton bags saturate the market, the brand loses its sense of exclusivity and consumers are put off buying the real thing. What worries brand owners most is that consumers take a relaxed attitude towards fakes. \"People like getting what they think is a bargain,\" says Paul Carratu.</p> <p>Research carried out by polling company Mori indicates that 40% of British consumers would knowingly purchase a counterfeit product if the price and quality were acceptable.</p> <p>Of those willing to buy counterfeits, 76% would buy clothing or footwear, 43% watches, 38% perfume and 22% electrical goods such as video recorders and CD players.</p> <p>\"One of the biggest problems with counterfeiting is that people tend to see it as a victimless crime,\" says Carratu. \"They picture the counterfeiter as a modern day Robin Hood who doesn't harm anyone, but this couldn't be further from the truth.\"</p> <p>The Department of Trade and Industry estimates that counterfeit goods cost Britain \u00a38bn a year in lost taxes.</p> <p>The purchase of fake goods does not just have economic implications. Some products are dangerous.</p> <p>Trading standards officers have come across \"designer\" perfumes that have resulted in burns and rashes, and West Yorkshire police recently recovered fake alcopops made with antifreeze and whisky spiked with industrial meths.</p> <p>Consumer affairs minister Kim Howells is urging consumers to take a more responsible approach to counterfeit goods. \"People think it's a victimless crime - it is anything but. Counterfeiting is often the tip of the criminal iceberg. There are links between counterfeiting and organised crime and it is often used as a means of laundering money gathered by drug dealers. A lot of this stuff comes from factories in eastern Europe and we have evidence of links to Russian mafia syndicates.\"</p> <p>That's something to ponder next time you are tempted by an extraordinarily cheap Olympics T-shirt, Prada handbag or computer game for the kids.</p>",
  "<p>Global warming is likely to destroy more than half the earth's colder habitats by the end of the century, causing the extinction of species which cannot adapt or move quickly enough to reach new homes, a report by WWF, formerly the Worldwide Fund for Nature, said yesterday. </p> <p>Worst hit will be the colder places in the northern latitudes of Canada, Russia and Scandinavia, where warming is expected to be most rapid, and areas like the Cairngorms in Scotland, where Arctic species have nowhere left to migrate. </p> <p>In order to adapt and survive plants may need to move 10 times more quickly than they did when recolonizing previously glaciated land at the end of the last ice age. Few plant species can move at a rate of one kilometre per year, the speed that will be required in many parts of the world. </p> <p>High migration rates will particularly threaten rare, isolated or slow-moving species but will favour weeds and pests that can move, reproduce or adapt quickly. Conditions today make it much more difficult for species to move to new habitat than was the case thousands of years ago. </p> <p>The last time the climate warmed anywhere near as quickly as is predicted this century was 13,000 years ago when sabre toothed tigers and woolly mammoths still roamed the earth and humans had just begun to populate the Americas. </p> <p>Any plant or animal that needs to move must contend with roads, cities and farms. The WWF study shows that human barriers to climate induced migration will have the worst impact along the northern edges of developed zones in central and north-western Russia, Finland and central Canada. </p> <p>\"As global warming accelerates, plants and animals will come under increasing pressure to migrate and find suitable habitats. Some will just not be able to move fast enough,\" said Adam Markham, executive director of the US non-governmental organisation Clean Air-Cool Planet, and one of the co-authors of the WWF report. </p> <p>Birds such as the great tit in Scotland and the Mexican jay in Arizona are beginning to breed earlier in the year, butterflies are shifting their ranges northwards throughout Europe and mammals in many parts of the Arctic, including polar bears, walrus and caribou, are beginning to feel the impacts of reduced sea ice and warming tundra habitat. </p> <p>In the US, most of the northern spruce and fir forest of New England and New York State could be lost. </p> <p>In patches of habitat that do survive, local species loss may be as high as one in five in the most vulnerable mountain ecosystems such as northern Alaska, Russia's Tamyr Peninsula and south-eastern Australia. </p> <p>The report's predictions are based on a moderate estimate that concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will double from pre-industrial levels during this century. </p> <p>However, some projections suggest a three-fold increase in concentrations by 2100, unless action is taken to reduce the inefficient use of coal, oil and gas for energy production.</p>",
  "<p>Kelly Windsor's never had it easy, despite what the people of <strong> Emmerdale</strong> (ITV) say about her. Not a country girl at heart, she has always been too fond of strappy sandals and lipgloss for a life among the hills and dales with not a Miss Selfridge for 50 miles. A liking for such things - coupled with a fiery determination to better herself - practically passes for wickedness in Emmerdale. So when she slept with her stepbrother Scott while married to the saintly but simple Roy Glover, there was hell to pay. And hell doesn't take Top Shop storecard. </p> <p>Dumped by Roy on her way to Ibiza, Kelly had no choice but to return home, spangly bikini unworn, Vengaboys CD still in the box. There, she has been shunned by the whole village bar Seth and Betty, who need some excitement in their lives, and Ashley, the ineffectual vicar who wrings his hands so much it passes for tintinnabulation. Like Lola the showgirl, she sits forlorn in the bar with not even her eyebrows for company. Kelly has been a bit overzealous with the tweezers, you understand, leaving them whispers of their former selves, like anorexic caterpillars. </p> <p>Scott has got off lightly, with his mum forgiving him for sleeping with Kelly (\"One's weak, the other's wicked. I can forgive weakness.\") and for that turn he did on Celebrity Stars In Their Eyes as Robbie Williams. All he has suffered is a bit of ribbing (for extra sensation) from Lesbian Frankie, the manic mechanic, and her gay grease-monkey sidekick - a right circus troupe the pair of them. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Ashley's beloved Bernice, all curves and demi-waves (who perhaps has been cryogenically frozen since 1957) went to visit Ashley's potential new - and rather grotty - parish with her mum, the wonderful Diane. \"Few rolls of calico and some nice nets,\" Diane advised. \"Carol Smillie's built a career on less.\" Bernice just smiled in a pained Diana Dors kind of way. Crossroads' Debbie Lancaster was right. \"Men are lucky. They get women. Women just get men.\" </p> <p>According to <strong> Hard Evidence Of Aliens Among Us</strong> (Sky One) - presented by the kind of man who might play an enigmatic business tycoon in an American daytime soap - extra-terrestrials aren't that fussy. They'll abduct anyone they can lay their big spindly hands on and stick probes in every orifice, creating new orifices if needs be. </p> <p>Apparently, 50 per cent of Americans believe in alien abduction and 800,000 maintain they themselves have been abducted, including Jesse Long, who says he has been repeatedly abducted since he was a child. Much hypnosis and faux-horrific reconstructions later, Jesse revealed he is the father of nine human-alien hybrids and that colonisation of Earth by aliens was imminent, just like in The X-Files. </p> <p>In a Kilroy moment, when he was asked what he'd say if he could confront his abductors, Jesse whined \"Why me?\"... which is exactly what I was thinking. One abductee whispered of her kidnappers \"They were tall, they were very thin, with huge eyes.\" So aliens look like Mick Jagger? Maybe Mick Jagger is actually an alien, preparing us for colonisation. </p> <p>With a lump of parmesan the size of Gibraltar, stainless steel accoutrements and random bundles of herbs dotted round Ms Lawson's enormous kitchen, <strong> Nigella Bites</strong> (C4) is either the worst kind of aspirational TV (making you feel guilty you don't make your own sultanas in rum or freeze marinading meat and label the bags) or the best kind (especially if you read Elle Decoration and yearn for a Smeg cooker). </p> <p>While the food wasn't as interesting as having a nosey around Nigella's house, a refreshing lackadaisical attitude infused the programme with her anti-presentation leanings. Fast food was the theme, and blink and you would have missed lemon linguine and chocolate pudding. Pop to put the kettle on and Nigella was halfway through chicken and couscous. So speedy she was, she could have been on The Crystal Maze. (\"Griddle the chicken! Get the crystal!\") But if the food wasn't presented prettily, Nigella's life was fetishised. </p> <p>Taking her son to nursery, eating ice cream in the garden, pointless shots of comfy chairs - the world may soon be colonised by Nigella clones, all of whom cook with tons of salt - and if she carries on the way she does, Siberia will be a hollowed out wasteland by 2005 - while wearing a denim jacket. Which is all very well, but does she clean her own oven?</p>",
  "Sixteen members of the Kurdistan Workers Party, the PKK, have been killed this week in renewed fighting in south-eastern Turkey, military officials said yesterday. Operations involving thousands of troops are continuing in remote mountainous areas. <p>The clashes come almost exactly a year after the PKK's imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan instructed his followers to observe a ceasefire and withdraw from Turkish territory. Thousands of fighters have obeyed the order, and relocated across Turkey's eastern border to camps in Iraq and Iran. However, several hundred members of the PKK, who are divided into small mobile groups, are still thought to be in Turkey. The armed forces have vowed to hunt them down until they surrender or have been killed. </p> <p>The current fighting is taking place in two separate locations - the border province of Hakkari where seven rebels have been killed, and the province of Tunceli, a traditional PKK stronghold, where nine bodies have been recovered. The Turkish armed forces are taking a hard line against the PKK. They dismiss the ceasefire as a temporary tactic, designed to try to save Ocalan from the gallows and to buy the PKK some time to regroup. </p> <p>After taking office last week the new army commander, General Hilmi Ozkok, said the PKK had realised it could not win on the battlefield, and he vowed that it would not be allowed to achieve its objectives by other means. \"The Turkish army lost thousands of martyrs in the struggle against separatist terrorism\", he said, \"and it will continue to prevent the traitors from attaining their political goals\". </p> <p>PKK hardliners believe armed struggle is their only option, but Ocalan has appealed for calm. He says he has abandoned all thoughts of a separate state, and he wants Turkey to grant its substantial Kurdish population a range of cultural rights. \"Peace has to be put into practice\", he said in a statement released through his lawyers last week. \"I am calling on everyone who is involved to make a more meaningful effort\". </p> <p>Meanwhile Ocalan sits in heavily guarded isolation on the prison island of Imrali in the Sea of Marmara. The European Court of Human Rights is expected to discuss his case in November.</p>",
  "A wry smile plays across the face of the fair-haired young man as he explains his feelings about asylum-seekers. \"When refugees are no longer in need they should go home but they don't and that's the problem. About 6,000 come here every year and if they bring their families that can add up to as many as 16,000 people.\" <p>Such views have struck a chord with many in Austria and eastern Germany but this is Denmark, a country whose liberal tolerant society has long been the envy of the world. But things are starting to change. The young man is Carl Christian Ebbesen, a board member of the ultra-nationalist Danish People's party (DPP) whose popularity ratings were as high as 15% earlier this year. The DPP's staunch opposition to Denmark ditching the krone in favour of the euro in next month's referendum has done wonders for its image and won it new-found respectability. </p> <p>Its leader, the 53-year-old self-styled housewife Pia Kjaersgaard revelled in a public one-on-one debate with the Danish prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, on the euro last week. An elfin-like blonde lady and mother of two, she does not look like a demagogue. But appearances can be deceiving and the core policies of the DPP or the Dansk Folkeparti as it is known in Danish are far from respectable. </p> <p>If it ever does win power, Denmark's reputation as a liberal society would be shattered forever. Aid to the third world would be privatised and poor countries forced to take action to \"restrict population growth\" if they wanted to receive any help. Recidivist paedophiles would find themselves forced to undergo \"medical castration\" and the criteria for Danish citizenship would be severely tightened. </p> <p>Refugees should, the DPP argues, be repatriated to their country of origin and only small numbers provisionally accepted. \"Denmark is not a country intended for immigration and the Danish People's party disagrees with the statement that Denmark will develop into a multi-ethnic society,\" the party's programme reads. </p> <p>The party is also hostile to the EU and would like to see the European Parliament, where it has one MEP, abolished. </p> <p>Just 4.5% of Denmark's population of 5.3 million is made up of immigrants but the DPP has shown itself adept at whipping up popular anti-EU and anti-foreigner sentiment. </p> <p>In 1998 Pia Kjaersgaard urged Danes to rally at Denmark's border with Germany and protest at cooperation between Jutland and Germany's Schleswig Holstein region. According to Bendt Bendtsen, the leader of the Danish Conservative party, the \"cooperation\" involved only minor activities such as student exchanges and a joint ambulance service. It was portrayed, however, \"as a joint EU-German attempt to regain control over old German territory in Denmark.\" </p> <p>Mr Bendtsen adds: \"It was tasteless, but by playing this tune on nationalistic strings they have distorted public discussion in Denmark to a point where a real dialogue is no longer possible.\" </p> <p>Former EU commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard warned last week that if Danes say 'nej' to the euro next month it will be seen as a swing to the DPP. Earlier this month even J\u00f6rg Haider's Freedom party refused to meet with Kjaersgaard. </p> <p>Yet the DPP is a real political force in Denmark. It polled 7.4% of the vote in the last parliamentary elections in 1998 and has 13 MPs in the Folketing (parliament). Now suggestions are growing that it may soon be in a strong enough position to prop up a centre-right government in exchange for a slice of power.</p>",
  "Three young neo-Nazis were yesterday convicted of a vicious race murder, in a case that has brought to a head the German government's concern over the far right's activities in the east of the country. <p>The widow of their victim, Mozambique-born Alberto Adriano, stayed away from the hearing at a court in the eastern city of Halle after receiving a death threat. </p> <p>The court sentenced Enrico Hilprecht, 24, to the maximum of life in prison. His two 16-year-old co-defendants, Christian Richter and Frank Miethbauer, were each given nine years in jail, one year less than the maximum sentence for juveniles. </p> <p>The judge called the deadly assault on June 11 \"the latest in a long chain of attacks to which we must put an end\". </p> <p>Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, called yesterday for the speedy imposition of a ban on the radical far-right National Democratic party of Germany (NPD). The government has moved gradually towards supporting a ban, despite the misgivings of its interior minister, Otto Schily. </p> <p>Critics, including senior officials in the counter-intelligence service, have argued that such a ban would merely make surveillance of the neo-Nazi scene more difficult. </p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der will today lay a wreath at a memorial erected at the spot where Adriano was attacked so savagely that he later died of his wounds. The killing was the third this year alleged to have been carried out by members of the far right. </p> <p>The court was told that the younger defendants had previous convictions for daubing swastikas. </p> <p>Tolerance of neo-Nazi violence is widespread in eastern Germany, especially among the young. In an effort to end this tolerance, the chancellor yesterday appealed to east Germans' pride in their recent history, encouraging them to take a stand like the one that put an end to communist rule in 1989. </p> <p>He said Germany needed a \"repeat of what people in the east of our country recognised in the peaceful revolution 10 years ago\", adding that the easterners had to \"involve themselves and fight for the right thing\". </p> <p>In Dessau, where Adriano was killed, police said his German-born widow had received a threatening letter which the public prosecutor's office was investigating. A spokesman for a foreigners' rights group said she had decided not to attend the final session of the court because she was \"simply too scared because of her children\". </p> <p>Mr Adriano, who was 39 and worked in a meat packing plant, left behind him three children, of whom the youngest is six months old. </p> <p>His killers yesterday sat expressionless in court yesterday as the verdict was read out. </p> <p>The defence had pleaded for shorter jail terms and for manslaughter or deadly assault charges, saying prosecutors had failed to prove that the attackers intended to kill Adriano when they set on him in a park after a drunken rampage through the city. </p> <p>A defence lawyer, Sabine Grunow, said all of the accused expressed regret in brief closing statements at the end of the four-day trial. Hearings were closed to the public because of German law regarding juveniles. </p> <p>Adriano was walking home in the early hours of the morning, when the three attacked him, screaming racist abuse. When they had kicked him unconscious, they stripped him of his clothes as a final humiliation. </p> <p>In a further instance of racist violence, prosecutors in the northern town of L\u00fcbeck said they had arrested two skinheads for attacking and injuring a 33-year-old African man whom they had taunted with racial slurs. </p> <p>Police in the German town of Waiblingen detained two men after two foreigners were slightly injured in an early-morning arson attack on a home for asylum seekers. </p> <p>Late on Tuesday, a 21-year-old German man was given a five-month suspended sentence and fined 500DM (\u00a3160) for punching a Hong Kong-born photojournalist who was trying to cover racism in the east.</p>",
  "President Bill Clinton flew into Colombia yesterday amid a countrywide outbreak of rebel violence and protests against a massive boost in US military aid to the government. <p>Leftwing guerrillas attacked police stations and army posts, bombs exploded outside banks and masked students clashed with riot police. </p> <p>The violence took place mostly around the three main cities and in rural areas hundreds of miles from Cartagena, the Caribbean tourist resort where 5,000 troops, 350 US agents, helicopter gunships and an American aircraft carrier provided security for Mr Clinton's nine-hour visit. </p> <p>On Tuesday night, rebels attacked 12 police stations in six of the country's 32 departments. Five civilians, including two children, died when guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) rained mortar bombs on a police station in the village of La Bateca, near the border with Venezuela. </p> <p>In south-west Cali, the second largest city, Farc guerrillas detonated bombs outside three banks, causing widespread damage but no injuries, police said. </p> <p>In the north-eastern oil- producing province of Arauca, another Farc unit attacked an army barracks near the town of Fortul on Tuesday afternoon, injuring six soldiers, an army spokeswoman said. Guerrillas also attacked an army post in the nearby town of Saravena. US-made Blackhawk helicopters flew to the region to strike back at the rebel column. </p> <p>Rebel commanders have denounced the US aid package, which includes 60 helicopters, equipment and training for the Colombian army, saying that money will cause an escalation in the civil war, and eventually US-backed military action against the guerrillas. </p> <p>\"Clinton isn't here to support social investment but a military plan. We don't want to make threats, but the Colombian people have the rights to take to the streets and protest against this visit,\" the Farc commander, Andres Paris, told the Guardian. </p> <p>In a videotaped address to the Colombian people broadcast on Tuesday night, Mr Clinton stressed the social development programmes included in the aid package, and denied that Washington planned military intervention. </p> <p>\"We have no military objective. We do not believe your conflict has a military solution. We support the peace process. Our approach is both pro-peace and anti-drug,\" Mr Clinton said. </p> <p>Yesterday the Miami Herald reported that the Pentagon is planning to send an army general to oversee the military element of the aid package. </p> <p>According to US law, a maximum of 500 American troops and 300 civilian contractors may be in Colombia at any time, but the president may waive the limit in the event of an \"imminent involvement\" of US forces in hostilities. </p> <p>The largest chunk of American money will pay for 60 helicopters to support a military offensive in the rebel-dominated jungles of southern Colombia, where most of the world's cocaine is produced. The helicopters and three US-trained anti-narcotics army battalions will lead the advance, securing control of drug plantations to allow the police to eradicate illegal crops. </p> <p>Mr Clinton waived strict human rights conditions to approve the aid last week, despite fears that the Colombian military maintains close ties with illegal rightwing paramilitary groups. </p> <p>In its 1999 report, the state department reported \"credible allegations of co-operation with paramiltary groups, including both silent support and direct collaboration.\" </p> <p>Monitoring groups in Colombia fear that the American money will exacerbate the country's 35-year civil war and cause up to 200,000 people to flee their homes. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cicad.oas.org/\" target=\"_new\">Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/www/background_notes/colombia_197_bgn.html\" target=\"_new\">US state department: Colombia</a><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.presidencia.gov.co/\" target=\"_new\">Government of Colombia</a></p>",

  "<p>The travelling salesman problem, or TSP to its aficionados, is one of a select band of computational puzzles that has broken heads for decades. </p> <p>Like all true brain-benders, the problem is easier to state than to solve. Imagine that you're travelling in monogrammed left-handed belly-button warmers and you have to hawk your fluffy-yet-stylish wares to department-store buyers up and down the land. </p> <p>It will save time and fuel if you work out the shortest possible itinerary that takes you to each destination just once and gets you back home. Easy? In computerspeak, the TSP is known as \"NP-hard\", which means that it reduces grown programmers to jelly, and there is no known general solution. </p> <p>But there is a new way to approach the problem. It is kind of zen: rather than throw even more brains at the problem, divide up your brainpower into individual units, each of which is little more than a mindless automaton. But before that, look at the ground. </p> <p>Looking? If you are, you will see nature's perfect answer to distributed-systems programming - the ant. Ants and other social insects such as termites, bees and wasps live in sophisticated, highly centralised societies that appear to live by a complex series of rules. </p> <p>But they have no written records or laws, nor even instructions badly typed, upside-down and in Finnish. And you could probably count the smarts inside the brain of any one ant on the fingers of one thumb. </p> <p>So how do ants and other insects forge their complex societies? The answer lies in distributed-systems programming in which a solution grows out of the combined activities of a large number of near-autonomous units, in other words, a pile of little-bitty busy little pismires. </p> <p>Here, then, is the route to formic success: as each ant forages, it leaves a trail of pheromone scent for other ants to follow. The routes to the best sources of food are likely to be the best-trodden, and so richest in pheromones. </p> <p>But pheromones evaporate in time, allowing ants to track shifting resources flexibly. And that's more or less it. There is no central planning or other organisation - the appearance of order grows out of the behaviour of thousands of individuals, a kind of \"swarm intelligence\". Ant colonies are what researchers call \"self-organsing\" phenomena, rather like Spike Milligan's self-made giraffe, mentioned in despatches for making himself from sawdust, string and patches. </p> <p>Using \"ant colony optimisation\", or ACO, researchers have been able to tackle problems such as the TSP using far less computer time than taken up by other approaches. </p> <p>An artificial software \"ant\", playing the part of the travelling salesman, will visit a string of destinations, laying notional cyber-pheromone in an amount proportional to the success of its tour. Subsequent ants tend to follow existing pheromone trails that are the strongest - after a few runs, a solution emerges. </p> <p>ACO and related distributed-systems approaches are of immense practical importance. Unilever is believed to be using ACO in planning factory scheduling, and petrol tankers in Italian Switzerland are routed to petrol stations using an ant-inspired algorithm. </p> <p>Switching strategies in telecommunications networks are naturally suited to take a tip from ants: British Telecom and MCI-Worldcom use switching systems based on ant foraging behaviour. </p> <p>\"The initial appeal of Swarm Intelligence to computer scientists was almost entirely due to their fascination with ants,\" wrote Eric Bonabeau of the Santa Fe Institute, New Mexico and colleagues in a recent article in Nature. But the fascination works both ways - entomologists are beginning to get worked up about robotics, to the benefit of both approaches. </p> <p>In today's issue of Nature, the entomologist Laurent Keller of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, and colleagues use their rich haul of data about real-life ant behaviour to design robot swarms. Each ant is represented by a pepperpot-sized robot; the robots search for tokens (resources) on a nine-square-metre surface, and bring them back to a base station (nest). </p> <p>Using extremely simple programming, Keller and colleagues found that there is an optimum number for robot foragers: too few, and resources lay unfound, too many, and the robots kept bumping into one another. </p> <p>This finding paralleled what they had found in real life: ants tend to have foraging parties of a certain size. </p> <p>In another parallel to insect societies, the group foraging effort became much more efficient if a robot could \"recruit\" another for a foraging trip to exploit resources, especially if they were clustered in certain areas. The researchers' robot swarm behaved uncannily like ants, even though each robot was programmed in an extremely simple way and behaved essentially autonomously. </p> <p>\u0095 Henry Gee's Book Deep Time: Cladistics, the Revolution in Evolution, is published by Fourth Estate, price \u00a320.</p>"
