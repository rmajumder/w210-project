She was built in 1904, she carried 31 sails (from main course to jigger topgallant), 5,000 tons of grain and two ships' pigs: Fabian and Filimon.</p> <p>Newby was 18, an apprentice who had never climbed rigging before - but he did have a camera, and this is an album of portraits of his first love and her other boatswains (they made small votive models of her, and trapped her an albatross).

He thieved gold from those who had extorted it from the natives, ordered the ship's surgeon to autopsy a hand dead of yellow fever (the doctor died of the resultant infection), and had a friend beheaded for questioning his authority. But the book is heedless of the ships: even the Pelican, Drake's own craft, gets no more than her mean dimensions specified, though she circled the earth with him, and he was dubbed knight aboard her. </p> <p> <strong> Shackleton</strong><br>Roland Huntford <br>(Abacus, \u00a312.99)</p> <p>Huntford, on the other hand, feels for Shackleton's ships as much as for the true-hearted Antarctic explorer. Maybe more so, since a ship is the innocent victim both to the ambitions of those aboard her and to the pitiless sea, and the last agony of Shackleton's vessel, Endurance, was cruel. She was the wrong build to be caught helpless in the frozen Wedell sea, not egg-shaped enough to slip above the ice when the pressure waves rippled through it like solid surf. She was twisted, the keel torn out of her. They abandoned her pumps. Eight Emperor penguins sang her dirge, and all hands had one last supper in her wardroom, silent but for the clock ticking.</p>",
  "<p>What has \"the sublime\" to do with us? In common parlance, \"sublime\" is one of those diminished words (like \"fantastic\" or \"terrific\") used to exclaim at anything from the delights of a certain kind of ice cream to the skills of a foreign footballer. It seems, banally, just to mean, \"much better than usual\". But if we can rescue its older, deeper meanings, \"the sublime\" catches an experience that we still recognise in a post-modern world, glimpsed in the dizzying reaches of interplanetary space or the vertiginous spirals of the human genome. </p> <p>In the past, the Alps, the Grand Canyon, Manhattan, the Book of Job, Paradise Lost, and the paintings of Turner have all been called \"sublime\". Until the 20th century, it was the accepted word for the fascination of all that dwarfs and overwhelms us. </p> <p>Mountains, for instance. Why do we love them? Because they shrink us and awe us. Stand in front of Turner's huge canvas Snow Storm: Hannibal and His Army Crossing the Alps - perhaps awed yourself by those huge crags and storm clouds looming over tiny soldiers - to get a sense of the sublime's fearful delight. TV programmes presenting cataclysmic highlights from nature (avalanches, tornadoes, cataracts and volcanic eruptions) dimly recall this thrill of the sublime. </p> <p>In the 18th century, intellectuals rediscovered the classical writer Longinus, who had been writing about the sublime in the first century AD. It seemed that this strange fascination, the delight in what we cannot master, had always existed. A new cult of the sublime was capped with Edmund Burke's Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757). For Burke, the sublime always belongs opposite the \"beautiful\". Beauty is what we can comprehend; sublimity is what we cannot grasp. Beauty is in proportion; sublimity is in vastness. The beautiful is satisfying; the sublime is stupefying. </p> <p>Primarily, the sublime was to be found in nature (though rarely in tame English nature). Many a British mountain-seeker went on his travels with Burke in his head. But it could be found in books too. For Burke, the most sublime writer was Milton in Paradise Lost, especially in those hellish passages where \"all is dark, uncertain, confused, terrible, and sublime to the last degree\". One of literature's most sublime characters was Milton's Satan, fascinating despite one's better instincts (the frightening pleasure of sublimity being apparently amoral). </p> <p>For the Romantic poets, the sublime was an encounter with the almost infinite powers of the human imagination. In The Prelude, Wordsworth sees Mont Blanc and regrets that the real mountain has taken the place of what he more sublimely imagined. Now the sublime is not in nature, it is in faculties of the individual (or, at least, some individuals). As Coleridge puts it: \"I meet, I find the Beautiful - but I give, contribute, or rather attribute the Sublime\". </p> <p>This is also Turner's sublime - the greatest stretch and test of the figurative imagination. Ever since, even if it has faded from literature, it has stayed as an idea in art, especially in American art. 19th-century American painting was dominated by huge landscapes that attempted to catch what Walt Whitman called \"that vast Something, stretching out on its own unbounded scale, unconfined\" - in other words, America. </p> <p>This experience was also remembered in the huge abstract paintings of artists like Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman. The latter is one of the main subjects of Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe's <strong> Beauty and the Contemporary Sublime </strong> (Allworth Press, \u00a312), which certainly demonstrates that art theorists still hanker after sublimity. Beauty is \"frivolous\", thinks Gilbert-Rolfe: enjoyable perhaps, but easily fabricated. Beauty is what we get from fashion and design. Theorists of art need something grander: a sublime art of \"limitlessness and indeterminacy\". For Gilbert-Rolfe, this produces a kind of elevating befuddlement, obliging the earnest student of art to turn to a high priest like himself. </p> <p>Dizzy post-structuralists like this have a shrunken version of the Romantic sublime. Depressingly, the sublime for them is when our imagination is defeated. Sublimity now describes moments when we recognise that any of our ways of comprehending the world are illusions. For Slavoj Zizek, author of <strong> The Art of the Ridiculous Sublime</strong> (University of Washington Press, \u00a39.95), this includes our conscious senses of ourselves. Zizek finds the sublime through psychoanalytic theory and the films of David Lynch, which apparently elaborate \"the Lacanian sublime\", and in which characters pursue \"impossible objects of desire\".</p> <p>For the theory men, the sublime is of human manufacture. Gilbert-Rolfe would like us to believe in a \"techno-sublime\". A geographical idea of limitlessness has given way to a technological one. This is a paradox, for the sublime is precisely what we cannot master, while technology is supposedly what allows us to control nature. </p> <p>As neither of these theoreticians of sublimity acknowledges, it has for a long time been pure science, not technology, that has given us a sense of the sublime. Now the voids into which we are invited to gaze in amazement are the unimaginably huge ones of Godless space and time. </p> <p>In some ways all this is not new. Shelley made poetry out of the temporal sublime, most famously in \"Ozymandias\", where the ancients are makers of huge abandoned ruins, mysterious markers of human smallness. If there is no providence, history can be a vast expanse that mocks our self-regard. And the Victorians were given an idea of time that was even more diminishing, even more sublime. They had geological time, in the span of which any person's life is nearly nothing. Down the tunnel of those millions of years we have since had to gaze, making a Darwinian world possible. </p> <p>Science, at least as popularised, can be beautiful as well as sublime. The beautiful is science in its shapely reductiveness; the sublime is science in its incomprehensibility. Popularisers of science sometimes seem worried about the imputation of reductiveness, and are often keen to assert that the world still inspires awe after science. Richard Dawkins's last book, Unweaving the Rainbow, was dedicated to showing us that the universe is more \"wonderful\" with science than without it. It even searched for proof that a mechanically comprehended universe can be poetically inspirational, seizing (unwisely) on James Thomson's ludicrously ecstatic poem in memory of Newton as an example. </p> <p>As Dawkins did not see, the poetical or artistic sublime is often close to the ridiculous. As the sublime was becoming fashionable, Alexander Pope produced a brilliant guide to this tendency, his \"Art of Sinking in Poetry\". It was a compendium of the failed sublimities of other poets, many of them contemporaries, and it introduced the word \"bathos\" to the English language. Those who reach for the sublime can fall on their faces.</p> <p>We see in Pope's examples, as in some of those 19th-century American landscapes, how scale can become mere bombast, significance mere self-importance. Grandiosity certainly tumbles into the ridiculous in the post-modern aesthetics of Gilbert-Rolfe and Zizek. On this evidence, we have to keep looking for better ways to recover the frightening, necessary delight of knowing our own smallness. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502343081,00.html\">Buy Beauty and the Contemporary Sublime at BOL</a></p> <p>\u0095 John Mullan is writing a book about anonymity for Faber.</p>",
  "<p>Fees, loans and, grants are a complex area, writes Liz Stuart. </p> <p>Rules on student funding have already been altered in Scotland, with more changes to come. So just who is entitled to what and when - and how much will the alumni-to-be have to pay for their studies? </p> <p>If you are English, Welsh or Northern Irish and starting a university course in England, Wales or Northern Ireland this September, you will have to pay \u00a31,050 towards the cost of your course fees, regardless of whether you are going to take up church studies or astrophysics. This effectively means you pay an average of \u00a31 in every \u00a37.50 of the course fee. </p> <p>This, however, is means tested - if your gross family income is below \u00a317,805 you will pay nothing, and if it is between this and \u00a333,000 you make a contribution on a sliding scale. According to the government, this means around one third of students will pay the full fee, a third pay something and a third pay nothing at all. </p> <p>Although the days of highly subsidised student life are long gone, loans are available to students with no interest payable until after graduation - known as, unsurprisingly, the student loan. The maximum loan under this arrangement for the coming academic year will be \u00a34,590, for a student living away from home and studying in London. This goes down to \u00a33,725 for students outside London and to just \u00a32,950 for those who opt to live with their parents during the academic year. </p> <p>Loans must be applied for at least one calender month before the course starts. If you are going to study abroad, different loan levels are available. Repayment will need to start when you earn more than \u00a310,000 a year before tax. </p> <p>There are some other forms of financial support available on a non-repayable basis, however. If you are a single parent and a student you may claim additional benefit, for instance. If you have dependants - children or a spouse or, if you are over 25, a co-habiting partner - you will also be entitled to benefit. The amount is means tested on the dependant's income. </p> <p>Hardship loans are also available, although these cannot be relied on as the money is granted at the discretion of the Student Loan Company and the biggest sum is just \u00a3500. This is offered to students who have applied for the maximum loan and received at least one instalment. This will also have to be repaid in the future; the same repayment scheme applies as for the standard student loan. </p> <p>If you have to attend college for longer than the usual term time of 30 weeks you are entitled to an additional payment. This is \u00a345 a week for those living at home, \u00a386 for students living away from home and studying in London and \u00a365 for those away from home outside the capital. </p> <p>Mature students and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds may also apply for a discretionary access bursary. These are granted by individual universities and do not have to be repaid. The maximum available is \u00a31,000. As each institution will only be able to offer a limited number of these, you should apply as quickly as possible. </p> <p>Scottish students, meanwhile, are at a distinct advantage to their English and Welsh counterparts. Those who opt to study in their own country can tap into a means-tested loan of up to \u00a33,725 as well as a non-means tested one of up to \u00a31,745 if they are to live in halls or digs or \u00a31,165 if they stay in the parental home. The income threshold for means testing is \u00a317,805. They are also exempt from course fees. </p> <p>Scottish students who opt to study south of the border are subject to the same loan and fee rules as their English and Welsh counterparts. </p> <p>\"We are delighted that the Scottish executive decided to abolish tuition fees, although we are still concerned about student hardship,\" says a spokesman from NUS Scotland. Although the overall financing packages for students have increased in line with inflation, the NUS calculates that there will still be a substantial shortfall between money available and the expenses students will face. For the next year the cash gap will be \u00a33,300 for students outside London, rising to \u00a34,000 for those at college in the capital. </p> <p>According to research by Barclays, graduate debt continues to rise - by 17% last year and by more than 100% since 1994, although, according to NatWest, one in five students are still graduating with no debt at all. The average amount owed to the Stu dent Loan Company, banks, credit card providers and parents is now \u00a34,497 for a person who has just left college. Coupled with a decline in the average graduate salary, this is worrying news for students. </p> <p> The DfEE publishes a leaflet Financial Support for Higher Education Students in 2000/2001, which is available by calling 0800-731-9133 or see the website <a href=\"http://www.dfee.gov.uk\">www.dfee.gov.uk</a> For the Student Loan Company tel 0800-405010.</p>",
  "Prince Charles yesterday sent an email of congratulations to Prince William, currently on exercise with the Welsh Guards in the jungles of Belize, after his eldest son was awarded A, B and C grades in his A-levels - good enough to secure his place at St Andrews University. <p>The prince, who left Eton last month, was awarded the A for geography, B for history of art and C for biology. The results were conveyed to him by his former housemaster and St Andrews graduate, Andrew Gailey. </p> <p>After taking a gap year, to be spent partly in Australia, the prince is expected to become the first member of the royal family to study at a Scottish university. He will go up in the autumn of 2001, reading for a four year history of art honours degree. The entry requirements are normally two Bs and a C. </p> <p>For a young man whose family have Rembrandts, Vermeers, Canalettos and Van Dycks hanging on the walls at home, course work and vacation studies should not pose a problem. The course, described in the university's prospectus as visually stimulating and intellectually challenging, is unlikely to be damned by the chief education inspector as vacuous. </p> <p>Prince Charles said: \"I know how hard William worked to achieve these excellent results and I am very proud that he has done so well.\" </p> <p>In a statement from St James's Palace, the prince was said to be \"obviously delighted and relieved that he has got into St Andrews\" and very much looking forward to becoming a student there. </p> <p>His grades - added to 10 GCSEs, eight of them As and two Bs, two years ago - appear to be the best achieved by a member of the royal family since they submitted to public examinations 33 years ago when Prince Charles obtained a C in French and a B in history in his A-levels. </p> <p>The choice of St Andrews, as opposed to Cambridge which members of the royal family have traditionally attended for the past 150 years, was apparently Prince William's own. Edinburgh and Bristol were also considered. </p> <p>Both his father and uncle Edward read history at Cambridge and both faced accusations of favouritism from contemporaries, something that William should not have to face. </p> <p>The choice of the oldest Scottish university will certainly ease palace security headaches, situated as it is in a small and intimate coastal town remote from the metropolis. It is also far away from the normal beat of paparazzi and the nearest nightclub is in Dundee. </p> <p>About 60% of its intake is from state schools. It may be the first time the prince will have met state school contemporaries. </p> <p>A spokesman for the university said St Andrews would provide a \"unique, nourishing and challenging environment\" for Prince William. </p> <p>\"We are pleased for him as we are for all successful applicants and look forward to welcoming him to our community,\" he said. </p> <p>Alex Salmond, outgoing leader of the Scottish National party and a St Andrews graduate, said the prince would assist the university's international reputation and it was a sensible choice for him to have made. </p> <p>But he added: \"The university will have to reinforce its efforts to make sure Scotland's oldest university is seen as a people's university, not just for the privileged.\" </p> <p>How other royals fared:</p> <p><b> Prince William</b> has proved himself to be one of the brightest members of the modern royal family, his three good A-levels coming after three A*s, five As and two Bs at GCSE two years ago. </p> <p>His father, the <b> Prince of Wales</b>, who was the first member of the royal family to sit public examinations, got two A-levels - a B in history and a C in french - after passing five O-Levels (he failed maths). But he had no say in his choice of university. A committee including Harold Wilson, the prime minister, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Dean of Windsor, the chairman of the committee of university vice-chancellors and Lord Mountbatten chose Cambridge for him, where he got a 2:2. </p> <p>Prince William's mother, <b> Diana, Princess of Wales,</b> did not take any A-levels and once told a 15-year-old boy that she could not answer a Trivial Pursuit question because she was as thick as a plank. </p> <p>The <b> Princess Royal </b> obtained an E in geography and D in history in her A-levels in 1968 but she did not go to university. </p> <p>The <b> Duke of York</b> gained three A-levels in 1979 - in history, english and economics and political science - and in 1982 the<b> Earl of Wessex</b> received two - in english literature and economics and political science, plus an S-Level in history. Buckingham Palace refused to divulge grades attained by princes Andrew and Edward yesterday, saying \"the examinations were harder then and the marking different\". </p> <p>Other A level highlights:</p> <p><b> \u0095Adam Spencer, 10, from Arlesey in Bedfordshire, is likely to be the youngest A-level success.</b> He achieved a grade B in maths after taking adult education courses at Luton sixth form college. \"I was actually hoping for an A but I'm very pleased with a B,\" he said. He intends to go to university at 14 to read maths. Brian Edwards, deputy principal of the college, said they had accepted Adam after other schools refused to take him because of his age. </p> <p><b>\u0095Sameer Sanghvi, 12, </b>from Finchley, north London, got a grade C in computing from Ryde College, Watford. </p> <p><b> \u0095Terry Tyacke, 74, extended his world record by passing his 27th A-level exam, scoring an A grade in film studies.</b> He left school at 15 with no qualifications and took his first exam aged 46, to encourage his daughter. \"I can't stop, it's like a drug and I am addicted,\" said Mr Tyacke, of Trowbridge, Wilts. </p> <p><b> \u0095Tamara Todorovic, a refugee from Bosnia </b>who could not speak English when she arrived in Britain with her family in 1993, has gained three As at A-level. She is leaving Bishop Stopford school in Kettering, Northants, for Warwick University. </p> <p><b>\u0095German Michael Tyka went to Culford School in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in September 1998, supposedly for a term to brush up his English, </b>but decided to stay on and won 6 A grades at A-level, in maths, biology, chemistry, physics, general studies and German. He will read biochemistry at Imperial college, London. </p> <p><b> \u0095At Conyers school, a comprehensive in Stockton on Tees,</b> Alan Elder made it into his exam board's top five performers in both maths and further maths. He is going to Cambridge University to read engineering. </p> <p><b> \u0095Christopher Cummins of Our Lady Sion School in Worthing, Sussex, achieved five grade As at A-level, which he sat when aged 16. </b>His passes were in maths with statistics, pure maths, mechanics, chemistry and physics. He also gained grade 1 in two Cambridge Step papers. Christopher, who also has nine A's at GCSE, plans to take up his place at Trinity College, Cambridge, next year, after a gap year in banking. His school, an independent day school, said his mathematical abilities made him \"probably one of the best students in the country in his age range\". </p> <p><b> \u0095Two students from Brockenhurst College in the New Forest - an open access \"tertiary\" college - gained five grade As at A-level and a distinction at S-level. </b>Matthew Findlay from Hythe and James Kermode from Lymington got the top passes in maths, physics, chemistry, further maths and general studies. Both are taking up places at Cambridge. The college reported record results this year, with 24 students achieving three or more grade As at A-level including eight students with four grade As. In 10 subjects at least half the candidates gained passes at grades A or B. </p> <p><b> \u0095Students at Kendrick girls' school in Reading were celebrating after winning national plaudits in their subjects. </b>Three girls at the leading grammar school won awards from their examination board for coming in the top five in the country in their subjects. And 17 students at the school, which has consistently topped the league tables, got straight As. Claire Hall, 18, who got three As in sociology, English and religious studies, was ranked by the AQA board within the top five nationally in sociology, along with classmate Jessica Swaile. And Sarah Abram, who came in the top five candidates nationwide in German, got straight As in English literature, sociology and French.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Thirsty Barmies prepare for their first \"dry\" tour</strong></p> <p>England's visit to Pakistan this autumn won't just be their first tour of the country in 13 years. It will also be the first time the Barmy Army has travelled to Asia. England's most passionate and boisterous supporters will be visiting a country which is hardly an obvious destination for them. There will be few of the opportunities to hit the beach, hit the bottle and pair off with local women which have been a major feature of their recent excursions to cheer on England in Australia and South Africa.</p> <p>Burnham concedes that the organisation will not, this time, have the numbers to make its presence at grounds felt the way it has in Sydney, Cape Town and Barbados. But a \"hard core\" of 25-30 supporters will be there, at least for some of the three Tests, and will be running through their usual patriotic routines. And how will the Barmy Army manage without alcohol? \"I don't know,\" he replies. \"It'll probably be a very quiet tour.\"</p> <p>The Barmies, however, are trying to turn the alleged deprivations of a Pakistan tour to their advantage. They have commissioned a special T-shirt for the trip. It originally showed a small cartoon character peaking over a wall, with two bubbles. One said: \"What, no booze!\" The other asked: \"Has anyone seen my mother-in-law?\" - a reference to an infamous remark made by Ian Botham. \"Pakistan,\" he declared after returning home early from the 1983-84 tour, \"is the kind of place to send your mother-in-law for a month, all expenses paid.\" </p> <p>But the host nation had the last word. When Botham, opening for England in the 1992 World Cup final in Melbourne, was given out for nought, he departed to taunts from Pakistan fielders of: \"Why don't you send in your mother-in-law now? She couldn't do any worse!\"</p> <p>Bearing in mind the risk of such retaliation, even the Army has now thought better of the planned T-shirt. Burnham and his fellow \"generals\" have just decided to abandon the mother-in-law reference, and have the T-shirt redesigned solely around the no-booze theme. \"We thought the mother-in-law business was quite a funny joke,\" Burnham said yesterday. \"We now realise it's as sensitive an issue in Pakistan as Shakoor Rana.\"</p> <p>The U-turn is not the first sign that the Army is at last acquiring a few diplomatic skills: a reference to Rana, the former umpire whose stand-off with England captain Mike Gatting in the Faisalabad Test on the 1987-88 trip was a major reason for the 13-year hiatus, was dropped from the official kit at an early stage. But that festering wound will still be reopened during the tour. \"We'll probably have a song about him as we go along,\" said Burnham. \"We'd like to test the water.\" </p> <p> <strong>Promising young county players suffer as loan system flops </strong></p> <p>One innovation in this English season of unprecedented change can already be judged a complete flop. The new football-style system allowing counties to loan players to one another has quite failed to catch the imagination. If it had taken off, Devon Malcolm, Northamptonshire's 37-year-old former England bowler, would now be sharing the new ball with Kent's David Master. But, as Bob Carter, Northamptonshire's director of cricket, explains: \"We wanted Dev as back-up in case of injury problems.\"</p> <p>Not one of the 400-odd registered players has been borrowed by another county, and it's now too late for any such deals to be struck. \"We haven't had any takers,\" confirms the ECB. Carter is blunter: \"It hasn't worked, has it?\"</p> <p>The scheme made sense in theory. The idea was that, particularly in the last six or seven weeks of the season, promising players languishing in county second XIs would be given opportunities to sharpen their game in somebody else's first team - maybe that of a club stricken with a run of injuries. \"We were very supportive,\" says a senior official of the Professional Cricketers' Association. \"Previously, a young player could fall out of favour halfway through the season - and his season was effectively over.\"</p> <p>The new system came with appropriate strings attached: only in exceptional circumstances would players aged 25 or over be allowed to turn out for a rival county; and no player on loan would be allowed to play in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup or NatWest Trophy if he had already represented his original county in that particular competition.</p> <p>Loans could also have provided a lifeline for some struggling senior players. Mark Lathwell's precipitous decline from England opener in 1993 to Somerset seconds might have been arrested by a spell with another county; and Lancashire's third spinner, Gary Yates, also enduring the frustration of 2nd XI cricket, might have benefited from a temporary change of county too. Lancashire might also have moved to fill gaps in its one-day seam attack, while Yorkshire might have borrowed a proper spinner.</p> <p>So what happened? Well, there were some near misses. Kent, having lost strike bowlers Dean Headley and Julian Thompson for the entire season, approached a number of other counties for replacements as far back as May. And Northamptonshire, who refused to loan them Malcolm, failed to persuade anyone to part with an allrounder to replace the injured Kevin Innes. They were also unable to place promising 2nd XI opening bat Alec Swann elsewhere, despite offering him to all first-division counties - Carter wasn't going to have Swann coming good against his own side.</p> <p>Why has the closest thing the county circuit has ever had to a transfer system been such a damp squib? Reasons given include the counties' innate resistance to change, fear of a sudden injury crisis and reluctance to hand opponents a potential matchwinner on a plate. Another factor is the unusual paucity of \"dead\" matches as the climax of the new-style season approached (loans could begin no later than July 31). One established county player produces a further explanation: \"Counties are reluctant to let go people in whom they've invested a lot of time and money. A player might do well at another club, maybe even sign for them.\" </p> <p>Paul Millman, Kent's chief executive, puts it like this: \"Conceptually, loans are a brilliant idea, and we're still very supportive. But counties have been nervous, especially in the first season of a two-division championship, about handing over talent they're not sure of, and then finding themselves in trouble. There's a fear factor: when it came to the crunch the counties we had discussions with weren't able to agree.\"</p> <p>Millman adds: \"Loans may work when people develop confidence in them. It needs someone to break the ice and demonstrate that it doesn't hurt either side.\" But even the senior PCA official concludes: \"I don't think this one's ever really going to fly.\"</p> <p><em>Charles de Lisle is the author, with Christopher Martin-Jenkins, of An Australian Summer: The Story of the 1998/9 Ashes Series (Faber).

  "He is a Republican governor, a self-made millionaire businessman with 1,000 employees, a married man with two children, a non-drinker, a successful athlete who is planning an expedition to climb Everest. And he supports the legalisation of marijuana. <p>Gary Johnson, the governor of New Mexico, was among the thousands of people in Los Angeles this week because of the Democratic party convention. It was just one of the many ironies of the week that it should be a Republican who was making some of the most radical political noises. </p> <p>Johnson addressed the Shadow Convention - the event organised by people who felt that the big issues were not being addressed by the main conventions - in the Patriotic Hall, just a few blocks down from the Staples centre, where the Democrats were holding their event. </p> <p>Johnson is an interesting man who was never part of the Republican machine and only decided to run for office at the last moment.

He had a similar message about the \"war on drugs\", and told a clearly amazed audience, used to Republicans talking rather differently, that \"soft on drugs has replaced soft on communism\". And he quoted Abraham Lincoln, saying that prohibition would do great harm to the cause of temperance because \"it makes a crime of that which is not a crime\". What was missing from political leaders, he said, was \"not brain but spine\". </p> <p>Charlie Rangel, a Democratic congressman who represents the Harlem area of New York City, said that he had recently met Fidel Castro in Cuba. Before his trip he had asked Bill Clinton if he had any message for him. The president had wanted him to ask about the political prisoners there. Rangel had asked him what he should say if Castro asked about all the \"political prisoners\" in American jails. \"They are the poorest people, the people of colour, the people that some people like to imagine don't exist,\" said Rangel. </p> <p>So the debate on one of the biggest issues dividing America did take place after all during convention week. But it is taking place in the shadows rather than in the open. President Clinton tried but did not inhale. Vice-President Al Gore tried as a lad but stopped. When George W Bush was, as he puts it, \"young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible\". </p> <p>The difference is that George W, unlike tens of thousands of young Americans, was not jailed for his irresponsibility. The speakers at the drugs debate in Patriotic Hall may be hoping for change, but it is unlikely that they are holding their breath before they exhale.</p>",
  "Turkish planes have bombed northern Iraq, killing at least 38 civilians and wounding 11, the Kurdistan Democratic party (KDP) said in a statement yesterday. <p>The KDP said the jets attacked an area inside Iraq close to the borders of Turkey and Iran, where Turkish Kurd guerrillas loyal to the imprisoned Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan have a number of bases. </p> <p>\"On August 15, while Turkish warplanes were pursuing PKK targets, a pasture camp inside Iraqi Kurdistan belonging to Iraqi Kurdish herdsmen and their families fell victim to the Turkish air raid,\" the KDP said. \"As a result 38 civilians were killed, 11 were injured and four are missing.\" </p> <p>Turkish military officials said they knew nothing of the incident. \"It is out of the question for us to bomb civilians,\" an army official said. </p> <p>\"Air operations in northern Iraq target the PKK,\" he said. </p> <p>The remote mountainous area of northern Iraq, outside Baghdad's control since the end of the Gulf war in 1991, is ruled by Massoud Barzani's KDP and a rival Iraqi Kurdish group. </p> <p>Ocalan's PKK, fighting for Kurdish self-rule in south-east Turkey, have long used the region as a base to mount cross-border raids, provoking frequent incursions by Turkish forces. </p> <p>The KDP's peshmerga fighters have regularly cooperated with Turkish troops to fight the PKK. </p> <p>\"We denounce this action which has led to the loss of so many innocent lives,\" the statement said. \"We demand that this incident be thoroughly investigated and that the victims are properly compensated.\" </p> <p>The Iraqi Kurdish satellite television channel, Kurdistan TV, showed the wounded, several of them small children, lying on hospital beds in the regional capital, Irbil. </p> <p>\"We were grazing our animals in the summer pastures,\" said a woman. </p> <p>\"Suddenly the planes flew over, then they flew back again and there were explosions everywhere. </p> <p>\"I don't know what happened then, but everywhere was covered in blood.\" </p> <p>\"We have nothing to do with the PKK,\" said another woman. \"We don't know why they bombed us, we were just grazing our animals.\" </p> <p> <br>Reuters</p>",
  "In ones and twos Kosovo Albanians approach the mortuary at Pristina's main hospital every day and look at the clothes hanging out to dry. Usually they go away frustrated but sometimes they recognise a T-shirt or a pair of trousers and break down in tears. It is proof at last that a husband, father, or son is dead. <p>For Detective Superintendent Steve Watts, the head of the British forensic team which has been exhuming bodies on behalf of the war crimes tribunal in the Hague, the scenes have been heart-rending. \"By now most bodies are skeletal and there are very sparse dental records in Kosovo. So items of clothing are often the only chance to identify people'\" he said. </p> <p>The exhumers photograph the remains, count the bodies and check for signs of the cause of death. When it comes to identifying people, usually they can do little more than determine the age and sex - except for bits of clothing, which are examined and then washed. </p> <p><b> Remarkable</b><br> </p> <p> Clothing displays have been organised elsewhere in Kosovo. At the most recent, at the bread factory in Fushe Kosove, grieving families recognised 15% of the articles. \"I thought this was a remarkable proportion,\" said Det Supt Watts. </p> <p>In the first year of the tribunal's operations in Kosovo, when bodies were fresher, the rate was higher. Roughly two-thirds of the 2,108 bodies exhumed in 1999 were identified. </p> <p>This year the British team, the largest in the territory, has been concentrating on two sites. It has dug up 180 bodies at a cemetery in Dragodan, a suburb of Pristina. They were found in unmarked pits, and often one hole had two or three bodies in it. \"Was it intended to hide the bodies?\", Det Supt Watts asked. </p> <p>At Makoc, near Pristina, the team reopened graves dug by Albanian villagers shortly after the war to give a dignified burial to 61 people who had last been seen when Serb forces separated them from a refugee column. Here the tribunal team's aim was to determine the cause of death. Many had gunshot wounds in the skull, apparently fired at close range. </p> <p>This year's digging by the British team has produced no evidence of bodies having been burnt. This would be a strong clue to deliberate tampering. </p>",
  "The final toll of civilians confirmed massacred by Yugoslav forces in Kosovo is likely to be under 3,000, far short of the numbers claimed by Nato governments during last year's controversial air strikes on Yugoslavia. <p>As war crimes experts from Britain and other countries prepare to wind down the exhumation of hundreds of graves in Kosovo on behalf of the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague, officials concede they have not borne out the worst wartime reports. These were given by refugees and repeated by western government spokesmen during the campaign. They talked of indiscriminate killings and as many as 100,000 civilians missing or taken out of refugee columns by the Serbs. </p> <p>The fact that far fewer Kosovo Albanians were massacred than suggested by Nato will raise sharp questions about the organisation's handling of the media and its information strategy. </p> <p>However, commentators yesterday stressed that the new details should not obscure the fact that the major war crime in the tribunal's indictment of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, and four other Serb officials is the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo and forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of people. </p> <p>\"The point is did we successfully pre-empt or not,\" Mark Laity, the acting Nato spokesman, said last night. \"I think the evidence shows we did. We would rather be criticised for overestimating the numbers who died than for failing to pre-empt. Any objective analysis would say there was a clear crisis. There was indiscriminate killing. There were attempts to clear hundreds of thousands of people out of their homes.\" </p> <p>When Yugoslav forces withdrew from Kosovo in June last year, Nato spokesmen estimated that the Serbs had killed at least 10,000 civilians. While the bombing was under way William Cohen, the US defence secretary, announced that 100,000 Kosovo Albanian men of military age were missing after being taken from columns of families being deported to Albania and Macedonia. \"They may have been murdered,\" he said. The fear was they might share the fate of the men who were separated from their wives and children and executed when Serb forces overran the town of Srebrenica in Bosnia. </p> <p>But while some 7,000 Bosnian Muslims died in the week-long Srebrenica massacre in 1995, less than 3,000 Kosovo Albanian murder victims have been discovered in the whole of Kosovo. \"The final number of bodies uncovered will be less than 10,000 and probably more accurately determined as between two and three thousand,\" Paul Risley, the Hague tribunal's press spokesman, said yesterday. </p> <p>In three months of digging this summer, the tribunal's international forensic experts found 680 bodies at 150 sites. This was in addition to the 2,108 bodies found at 195 sites last year before exhumations were called off because of winter frosts. \"By October we expect to have enough evidence to end the exhumations by foreign teams, and they will not be necessary next year,\" Mr Risley added. </p> <p>Although the tribunal has received reports of another 350 suspected grave sites, it believes the cost and effort of uncovering them would not be justified. Some suspicious mounds or patches of rough earth in fields where villagers reported a foul stench turned out to contain dead animals or to be empty. </p> <p>When the tribunal's teams reached Kosovo last summer, shortly after the international peacekeepers, they were given reports of 11,334 people in mass graves, but the results of its exhumations fall well short of that number. In a few cases, such as the Trepca mine where hundreds of bodies were alleged to have been flung down shafts or incinerated, they found nothing at all. </p> <p>The tribunal's indictment of President Milosevic includes the charge that during Nato's bombing campaign Serb police shot 105 ethnic Albanian men and boys near the village of Mala Krusa in western Kosovo. Witnesses claimed hay was piled on the bodies and set alight. Tribunal experts believe the remains may have been tampered with later, since the bones of only a few people were found. </p> <p><b> Motives questioned</b><br> </p> <p> The exhumation of less than 3,000 bodies is sure to add fuel to those who say Nato's intervention against Yugoslavia was not \"humanitarian\" and that it had other motives such as maintaining its credibility in a post-cold war world. Others say Nato's air strikes revealed a grotesque double standard since western governments did nothing when hundreds of thousands were being massacred in Rwanda. </p> <p>Carla del Ponte, the tribunal's chief prosecutor, told the UN security council: \"Our task is not to prepare a complete list of war casualties. Our primary task is to gather evidence relevant to criminal charges.\" </p> <p>Evidence of the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of people was overwhelming before the tribunal gained access to Kosovo but the exhumations are aimed at finding evidence for the charges of mass murder. </p> <p>\"Their benefit is to link forensic evidence to particular units of the police and army operating in particular parts of Kosovo. It wasn't a case of rogue units. The Serbian police state was fully involved,\" Mr Risley said. But officials will not say how many of the 2,788 bodies exhumed show clear signs of being victims of summary execution such as being shot in the head from close range. </p> <p>No Nato government has sought to produce a definitive total of murdered ethnic Albanian civilians since the Serb offensives began in March 1998, a year before the bombing. \"No one is interested,\" complained a senior international official in Kosovo involved in helping victims' families. \"Nato doesn't want to admit the damage wasn't as extensive as it said. Local Albanian politicians have the same motive. If you don't have the true figure, you can exploit the issue.\"</p>",
  "More than \u00a3800m has been wasted on a \"fraud free\" benefit swipe card for 17m claimants which will never be used, parliament's financial watchdog reveals today. <p>The card, flourished at the 1995 Conservative party conference by Peter Lilley, then social security secretary, was cancelled by his Labour successor, Alastair Darling, last May after ministers were told they were throwing away \u00a315m a month on a system that could never work. </p> <p>The national audit office said taxpayers have lost \u00a3127m; ICL, the computer company that designed the product, \u00a3180m; and the Post Office is facing a \u00a3571m loss, to cover the debacle. </p> <p>The card was ordered by the benefits agency and the Post Office as a fraud-proof way of paying out more than 24 benefits to 17m claimants at 20,000 post offices in the United Kingdom. The card, which would have cost \u00a31bn in total, promised to handle 760m payments to claimants a year and save the ministry \u00a3100m a year by making benefit fraud impossible. </p> <p>The auditors reveal that even when the card was commissioned in 1996 civil servants knew it was a high risk project. Papers from the time reveal ICL's card system had \"weak authentication procedures and the weakest security proposals\", and the company's subsidiary, Pathway, had a \"manifest lack of under standing of the management of fraud risk\". </p> <p>Despite misgivings, Whitehall ordered the system before 289 operational problems had been solved because it fitted in with the Tory government's support of private finance initiatives, in which the private sector takes some of the risk. </p> <p>The card was used to pay child benefit in 10 post offices in Gloucestershire under the Tories. Later Labour extended it to pay child benefit in 205 post offices in the south-west and north-east of England in November 1997. </p> <p>After 18 months of further negotiations Labour scrapped the project in May last year, deciding to go ahead with the automation of post offices without the new card. Instead benefit payments would be paid direct to bank and post office accounts. The scale of the scandal led Tony Blair to order the Cabinet Office to review the handling of future large scale hi-tech projects by Whitehall. </p> <p>Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general, is livid about Whitehall's handling of the project. In today's report he puts the blame on the \"organisational myopia\" in Whitehall which allowed \"fundamental flaws in the design of the management of the scheme\". </p> <p>He also blames rows between the Post Office and the Department of Social Security, which had different priorities in using the card. Social security wanted to curb fraud; the Post Office wanted to expand its business under automation. </p> <p>\"Although in theory projects can be run by two or more organisations, in practice this is a recipe for dispute and delay, which is what happened in this case,\" Sir John said. </p> <p>He is critical of \"the insufficient work that went into specifying the project and for demonstrations by bidders\". </p> <p>\"The result of skimping at the start was vast delay and as it turned out, wasted money.\" </p> <p>Sir John, who says that in hi-tech projects \"mistakes like this are being made time and time again\", calls for sweeping changes, including the appointment of one person in Whitehall, a \"risk scrutineer\", to take responsibility for each major project. </p> <p>David Davis, chairman of the House of Commons' public accounts committee, said he hoped the NAO's report would mark a watershed in the way Whitehall managed information technology projects. </p> <p>\"Today's report by the NAO is the latest, and probably worst, example in a long line of public sector IT debacles,\" said Mr Davis, Conservative MP for Haltemprice and Howden. </p> <p>Mr Darling welcomed the report: \"We cancelled the benefits payment card because it was three years late, costs were escalating and in any event the card would have been obsolete in five years time. It would have been utterly irresponsible to continue with the project. </p> <p>\"The cost of making payments by the card would have been 65p per payment. The cost of making payments by automatic credit transfer is less than 1p per payment. The move to automatic credit transfer from 2003 will virtually eliminate \u00a3100m of fraud in benefit payments annually.\" </p> <p>David Rendel, Liberal Democrat member of the public accounts committe, said: \"The project has been a disaster from start to finish. It has cost the Post Office millions and threatened the future of the post office network ... and the public sector has ended up footing most of the bill.\" </p> <p> <b>Computer errors</b><br></p> <p> <b> The passport agency </b> Two years ago thousands of people had to queue outside the agency's London headquarters after a new computer system, developed with the German firm Siemens, to issue passports failed to deliver. The system is now on course but the taxpayer lost \u00a312.5m. </p> <p><b> Civil aviation authority</b> Millions of holiday air passengers are facing delays because a \u00a3623m air traffic control centre at Swanwick, Hampshire has not opened. The computerised system does not work and will need more modification before it enters service. </p> <p><b> Inland revenue </b> Computerisation of the Inland Revenue undertaken by EDS. Cost of the contract is now \u00a32.4bn - \u00a31bn higher than first planned. </p> <p><b> Contributions agency</b> Some 172,000 Serps pensioners lost between 1p and \u00a3100 a week last year when a computer system developed by Andersen Consulting for 65m national insurance accounts could not handle all the data. </p> <p><b> Immigration directorate </b> Thousands of immigration and asylum seekers had to endure hardship and anxiety after a computer system, also designed by Siemens, was not suitable to handle the applications. The result was a backlog of 219,000 cases. </p> <p>Not everything fails. The \u00a328m Home Office tagging scheme for prisoners has been praised.

  "You can count on the Women's Institute to lay on an invigorating trip. Last week we visited Chillingham Castle to see the wonderful restoration of this Borders pile which has been in possession of the Grey family since the 1900's. As a child I remember seeing its crumbling turrets spiking the racing sky as we piled out of the ancient Morris minor and gaped enthralled at this marvellous hoary, tottering building, the spirit of Border frays oozing from its very moss. <p>I went along with the WI to see the restoration undertaken by Sir Humphry Wakefield over the last 20 years. When restoration started, the castle was virtually roofless with almost a ton of pigeon droppings on each floor. During the second world war, soldiers were billeted here and were so cold that they stripped panelling off the walls to keep the fires burning. \"After extensive rot had been removed, 16 roofs had to be replaced,\" Sir Humphry told me. \"But underneath the rotted Victorian and Georgian plasterwork we found medieval splendour. Great open fireplaces, passages and windows and one walled-up Tudor chimney containing over 100 documents and the oldest writ in Northumberland, dating from 1540.\" </p> <p>From one of the turreted stairways in the south wall of the castle I looked out of a casement window onto the beautifully restored Italian garden with lawns, clipped hedges of box and yew and the longest herbaceous border in the north of England. In medieval days, the garden had been a \"tilt yard\" and on a platform at the west end wall, ladies sat to watch their knights jousting. Now there are rose beds and neat hedges. </p> <p>Sir Humphry admits that restoration of the castle had been a Herculean task and, at the start, the resident ghosts had been hostile. \"They didn't like being disturbed,\" he confided. \"But once I became constructive they realised the ambience was positive and came on to my side.\" Scenes from the film Elizabeth were filmed at Chillingham and when the cast were working in full costume, extra figures of that era were noticed in the crowd scenes. \"They were our ghosts mingling,\" explained Sir Humphry.</p>",

  "Egypt yesterday claimed vindication in the latest round of the politically charged investigation into the crash of EgyptAir flight 990, which plunged into the sea off Massachusetts last October, killing 217 people. <p>American investigators believe that the 59-year-old co-pilot, Gamil al-Batouti, deliberately pushed the aircraft into a fatal dive when the captain left the controls to go to the toilet. </p> <p>But yesterday Mohammed Fahim Rayan, EgyptAir's chairman, said he was \"99% sure\" that a technical problem, not a suicidal pilot, had caused the Boeing 767 to crash. </p> <p>Earlier this week, Boeing urged all airlines flying the wide-bodied 767 to make special checks on the bell cranks - mechanical links from the hydraulic controls that help to move the elevator flaps on the tail. </p> <p>Boeing denied any connection with the crash investigation, but EgyptAir was delighted. \"This is exactly what we've been talking about,\" said Captain Shaker Kelada, the airline's safety chief. </p> <p>Bell cranks retrieved from the wreckage of flight 990 were found to have rivets sheared in opposite directions, which EgyptAir says may indicate that the elevators - controlling the up and down attitude of the plane - jammed. </p> <p>\"We have seen at least two similar complaints from the Boeing's 767 elevators by Air Canada and Air Mexico,\" Walid Murad, head of the Egyptian Pilots' Federation, said. </p> <p>Egypt has always rejected the suicide theory, suggesting that investigators latched on to the theory to exonerate Boeing from any part in the disaster. </p> <p>A series of leaks to the American press during the early stages of the investigation sought to portray Batouti as an Islamic fundamentalist. When that was disproved, subsequent leaks portrayed him as an unbalanced sex maniac who harassed women in hotels. </p> <p>Although the American national transportation safety board (NTSB) has not yet reached a conclusion about the cause, last Friday it released the first 1,665 pages of documents relating to the crash - including the first full transcripts from the cockpit voice recorder. </p> <p>Far from confirming the suicide theory, the transcript shows Batouti cooperating with the captain after his hasty return to the cockpit in an effort to save the plane. </p> <p>Twenty-eight minutes into the flight, and two minutes before the crash, with Batouti in charge in the cockpit, there are sounds described as a thunk and a click. The voice recorder then captures three syllables of non-Arabic speech. Four of the 10 people involved in the transcription believe they heard words similar to \"control it\"; one thought it might be \"hydraulic\"; five say it is unintelligible. </p> <p>Immediately after this, Batouti says faintly: \" tawakilt ala Allah \" (I rely on God) - a phrase he repeats 10 times before the recording breaks off. </p> <p>The American suicide theory was based on the fact that Batouti uttered this phrase, routinely used by Egyptians facing difficult situations, before the autopilot was disengaged and the engines shut off. </p> <p>There is also nothing in the transcript to support earlier American claims that the captain, Ahmed Mahmoud al-Habashi, and Batouti fought for control of the plane. </p> <p>In the transcript, Batouti asks: \"What's happening?\" but there is no suggestion that Batouti has done something wrong or is not working to save the plane. </p> <p>Leaks from the investigation earlier also suggested that Batouti switched off the engines to prevent Habashi pulling the plane out of its dive. But the Egyptian Pilots' Association says the crew were following standard procedure in order to slow the aircraft's speed. In the transcript, Habashi orders Batouti: \"Shut the engines\". Batouti replies: \"It's shut\". </p> <p>In the space of 40 seconds, the plane descended from 33,000ft to 16,000ft before the voice recorder cut off. </p> <p>On the basis of radar observations, US investigators say that it later climbed to 24,000 feet before finally dropping into the sea. The Egyptian Pilots' Association claims this is another error. </p> <p>Ali Murad, the association's deputy secretary general, says: \"If the engines were switched off during the dive, how did the plane manage to climb up to 24,000 feet again? What was seen at 24,000 feet were remains of the plane which fell more slowly than the main part.\" </p> <p>Before the NTSB's release of documents, the American paper USA Today published leaks from an FBI investigation in which security staff at the New York hotel used by EgyptAir crews alleged that there had been complaints about Batouti exposing himself from behind a window, and that he had harassed chambermaids. None of these incidents was reported to police at the time, and there were statements from other hotel workers describing Batouti as a pleasant man who caused no trouble. </p> <p>To the co-pilot's nephew, Walid Batouti, the latest leaks \"all confirm the conspiracy being made against Batouti and EgyptAir\".</p>"
