  "<p> So here we are in Edinburgh, that hell hole of the North, and we have been ushered into an audience with Garth Marenghi, dream weaver, shaman, one hell of a man and the author of 24 classic horror novels including Black Fang (rats learn to drive) and The Ooze (can water die?). </p> <p>Such is my unfamiliarity with the horror genre and such is the detailed pastiche of this show, right down to its brilliant flyers with their two-for-one Goth offer, that I have to confess there were a couple of minutes at the start when I thought our Garth might be for real. </p> <p>But it soon becomes clear - as Garth squares up to face the Fright Knight who has kidnapped his muse, does battle with the hag who makes ice-cream from her own breast milk and subdues the forces of evil - that this is a very slick and very funny spoof on the whole tacky genre. It's just been nominated for the Perrier, so leave your incredulity and good taste behind, and prepare to be truly terrified by the fact that one man can single-handedly inflict such devastating damage on the English language. </p> <p> Till August 28. Box office: 0131-556 6550.</p>",
  "The United Nations yesterday attacked the government's record on race relations, expressing \"deep concern\" over the number of racist attacks and condemning the plight of asylum seekers in Britain. <p>At a meeting in Geneva, the UN committee on the elimination of racial discrimination said that ethnic minorities in Britain were feeling \"increasingly vulnerable\" to racist attacks and harassment. It also condemned institutional racism in the police and other public bodies which, it said, had led to \"serious shortcomings with regard to investigations into racist incidents\". </p> <p>The damning criticism came in response to a report submitted to the UN in May by the British government into what measures had been taken to tackle racism over the past three years. </p> <p>Officials from the Home Office and the Foreign Office travelled to Switzerland last week to try to head off criticism, insisting that the government had met most of the committee's recommendations from the last UN report on Britain, soon after Labour came to power in 1997. </p> <p>But in an embarrassing report, the UN committee, which meets every three years and is responsible for monitoring racism in member states, urged Britain to \"take leadership in sending out positive messages about asylum seekers\" and formulate ways of protecting them from racial harassment. </p> <p>It urged the government to tackle high unemployment and school exclusion rates among ethnic minorities, and recommended that ministers develop a cross-departmental strategy to combat racial discrimination. </p> <p>The report did, however, praise recent moves by the home secretary, Jack Straw, to increase penalties for racially motivated crimes. It also welcomed the government's action plan developed following the publication of the Macpherson report in February 1999 into the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence. </p> <p>The UN's concerns follow a report submitted by more than 30 human rights organisations, including the civil rights group Liberty, the anti-racist 1990 Trust and the Refugee Council which condemned the government's record on race relations and deaths in custody, and claimed that the policy on asylum-seekers \"gives comfort to racists\" and has led to increased racial tension. </p> <p>Ministers will be disappointed that the UN committee backed many of the criticisms made by British civil rights groups. </p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said: \"We have not yet seen this report and obviously we will want to look at it in detail before commenting on specific criticisms, but we believe that some of the comments are unfair.\" </p> <p>\"Promoting racial equality is a top priority for this government, which has done more to promote race equality than any previous government.\"</p>",
  "<p>Charity fundraisers who stop you in the street may have to watch their step in future. The practice of \"face-to-face\" fundraising, asking passers by to set up a direct debit, has spread rapidly through Britain's high streets in the past two years. But a review of charity law in Scotland, together with a code of practice south of the border, look likely to begin to curb what some see as an over-aggressive technique.</p> <p>The prospect of controls in Scotland has come with the launch of a consultation paper from the Scottish charity law review commission. The paper suggests that the legal definition of \"public charitable collection\" may be too narrow and notes that it excludes non-cash appeals.</p> <p> Jean McFadden, who is chairing the commission, says: \"I have heard that some people are worried about the increasing use of professional fundraisers who collect direct debit details from people in the street to ensure regular donations to charities.\" </p> <p>The 14-member commission is undertaking a programme of fact-finding visits over the summer and has invited comments on its paper by September 29. McFadden says she wants to \"hear directly from people what they really think about charities and what they think we should do to modernise the regulation of charities\". The commission's final recommendations will be presented to the Scottish parliament next spring. </p> <p>The Charity Commission says it has no plans for a corresponding review of the law in England and Wales. But a spokesperson warns: \"Members of the public should not give in to pressure to donate against their better judgment. If individuals are asked to make long-term financial commitments, they should feel free to take the material home and look at it more closely.\" </p> <p>To discourage aggressive forms of face-to-face fundraising, the Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers (ICFM) has just issued a code of practice on what it calls \"personal solicitation for committed gifts\". Andrew Watt, who heads the ICFM's policy unit, says: \"We as a sector see this work from the inside, from a practitioner's viewpoint. The danger is that the public can see the external manifestation of this as an alienating and inappropriate level of commercialism, rather than the professional approach that all responsible fundraisers must undertake.\" </p> <p>The institute has also drawn up a draft donors' rights charter and an accompanying complaints procedure. This eight-point pledge is being circulated among fundraisers for consultation and will be issued to the public in early December. It states that donors have the right to expect fundraisers to observe the highest professional standards at all times. </p> <p>Practitioners of face-to-face fundraising claim that they do maintain high standards. Personal Fundraising Partnership (PFP) is one of the leading agencies in the field and has an office in Glasgow. James Hale, its PR and marketing manager, says that its fundraisers only talk to passers-by who express an interest, and that there is no pressure to give to the charity. </p> <p>\"As with any new medium, we can understand people's concerns,\" says Hale. \"The same was true of direct mail or telesales in the past, but these rarely attract comments now. Face-to-face fundraising has inevitably attracted a lot of attention due to its visibility on the streets, though some reports have been alarmist and over-exaggerated.\" </p> <p>Greenpeace UK was one of the first organisations to introduce face-to-face fundraising, which it had pioneered in Germany. The charity's marketing director, Annie Moreton says she was surprised by McFadden's comments. \"Face-to-face has one of the lowest complaint rates compared with other forms of fundraising.\" </p> <p>Although it is seen as a new method, Moreton points out that talking to people to interest them in a charity is one of the oldest techniques in the world. Greenpeace has conducted research among those it has recruited and found an \"extremely positive\" response to the method. Moreton says that younger people, in particular, welcome the opportunity for dialogue. This seems to be borne out by research conducted by PFP. Of new donors recruited, 85% are under the age of 40 and some 60% to 75% are not supporting any other charity. Hale says: \"This shows that we are tapping into a new pool of donors that are not being reached by other fundraising methods.\" </p> <p>However, Richard Radcliffe, chair of legacy fundraising agency Smee and Ford, is concerned about the impact on existing donors. He says: \"I heard someone on the street the other day complaining about face-to-face fundraising going on and saying they would take the charity out of their will.\" As well as gathering anecdotal evidence, Radcliffe has conducted almost 400 focus groups researching attitudes to fundraising. He found the most common complaints of respondents centred on poor direct marketing, telemarketing - and face-to-face fundraising on the streets. \"What alarms me at the moment is how many members of the public think there is too much fundraising and that it is done in too direct a way,\" says Radcliffe. \"The danger is that this may lead to less giving in the long-term.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Scottish charity law review commission's consultation paper is at <a href=\"http://www.charityreview.com\">www.charityreview.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Data from top secret navy submarine missions under the North Pole holding vital clues to the nature and speed of global warming could end up lying unused because scientists have not been given the money to finish analysing it. </p> <p>In an unprecedented act of openness about one of its murkiest areas of operations, the Ministry of Defence has released sonar measurements of Arctic ice thickness taken by nuclear submarine crews during eight previously unreported polar voyages. The data was given this year to Peter Wadhams, of the Scott Polar Research Institute, in Cambridge, who has accompanied nuclear sub crews on other journeys below the Arctic ice.</p> <p>Together with data already analysed from US navy subs, the new figures would give climate experts a powerful tool to quantify the impact of man-made warming on the global environment. They expect to be able to confirm scientists' fears that, largely due to global warming, the ice pack is vanishing, and the Arctic basin could be completely ice-free in summer by 2050.</p> <p>But the government has given Dr Wadhams only half the money that he needs to turn the raw data into usable information.</p> <p>\"Up till now, instead of having data for every year, we've had gaps,\" Dr Wadhams said. \"So when we see a thinning of the ice it's possible for people to say that, in the missing years, it got thicker again.</p> <p>\"The results would be incredibly rewarding. We think they would confirm a steady downward trend in the thickness of the ice, rather than a cycle of thinning and thickening.\"</p> <p>When Dr Wadhams applied to the government body that gives out grants to scientists for climate work, the Natural Environment Research Council, he was told he could only have funding for 18 months of work - \u00a3102,000 - instead of the three years he asked for.</p> <p>\"The navy has been very helpful towards science,\" he said. \"There's been a wonder ful collaboration with them, and now it's extra wonderful because they have released data from previously classified voyages. The only problem is that we need funds to work the data up.\"</p> <p>Computer models of climate change forecast global warming happening faster in the Arctic than elsewhere in the world, making it a crucial laboratory. There are fears that, in a century's time, the Arctic melt will deflect the Gulf Stream short of the British Isles, making the UK significantly colder than it is now.</p> <p>\"It's vitally important, because the Arctic is showing us climate change at an accelerated rate, and it will have a marked impact on our own climate. NERC ought to view this as high priority, but it's very difficult for them to change their way of thinking,\" Dr Wadhams said.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for NERC said there was a lot of competition for grants, particularly in the field of climate change, and Dr Wadhams had also received a grant of \u00a3311,000 for another Arctic ice study.</p>",
  "<p>Had there been anyone there to watch, they would have thought that some gigantic, terrible sea creature was trying to break through the ice. There, at the North Pole, on March 17, 1959, a wind-scoured expanse of flat snow and hummocks was being broken into from below. With an eerie lack of sound, a huge black shape burst through the ice and settled, long, featureless and menacing, in the wasteland. </p> <p>That was the day that Commander James Calvert and his men, the crew of the US nuclear submarine Skate, made history by being the first to test the thickness of the ice at the top of the world in the most dramatic way possible, with the hull of the boat they relied on to get them back home. </p> <p>Since then, scores of submarines, including many from Britain, have visited the pole this way. A long, sometimes anxious, often boring, cruise under the ice; the search for a way up: a crack in the ice, known as a lead, an area of open water - a polynya - or a stretch where the frozen layer between water and sky is thin enough to break; the call to action stations; and the careful easing of the vessel up to the surface, sometimes with heart-stopping sounds of cracking and straining as the ice yields. And then, for the Royal Navy at least, a spot of football at the pole. Or, as has been known, the best cricket playable in three layers of clothing and Arctic mittens. </p> <p>These cruises were for the sake of apocalyptic wars to come. The measuring of the thickness of the ice by sonar as the submarines hummed through the dark waters was just a by-product. But as scientists began to analyse the results of these measurements, they noticed a curious thing: year after year, the ice was becoming thinner. Amid fears of global warming, with the cold war gone, it starts to look as if the main legacy of those under-ice voyages will be the warning of a completely different apocalypse, equally man-made and equally destructive - the floods and famines of a world grilled under a blanket of greenhouse gases. </p> <p>Earlier this month, a group of American tourists were startled, when they reached the North Pole on board a Russian icebreaker, to find that there was no ice to break. The pole, in our imaginations a flat white sheet scoured by twisting lines of wind-blown snow, was open water. Gulls flew overhead. The nearest stretch of ice capable of bearing the weight of the tour party was six miles away. </p> <p>\"There was a sense of alarm,\" said Dr James McCarthy, an oceanographer and one of the tourists. \"Global warming was real, and we were seeing its effects for the first time that far north.\" </p> <p>Arctic specialists read fearful media accounts of the icebreaker tour with mixed feelings. On one hand, they knew that open water at the North Pole is not, in fact, unusual - as the repeated submarine surfacings there show. Even in winter, the winds which keep the ice constantly moving across the sea of the Arctic basin cause cracks, ridges and large polynyas to appear. The Skate surfaced in 1959 through a lead of open water which had recently frozen over. </p> <p>Yet they knew, too, that the tourists had witnessed something new - the thinness of the ice across the whole Arctic region, where historically it has been up to 3m thick. The evidence is mounting. The US Navy has provided its data, the Royal Navy has just released its last classified figures for analysis, and the Russians are rumoured to be preparing to put their information on the market. From 1300km up, satellites are able to measure ice thickness with incredible accuracy - to within 10cm. All the signs are that the sea ice over the Arctic is melting, and in 50 years' time, in summer, there could be no ice there at all. </p> <p>\"The average ice thickness in summer has decreased by 40% between the 1970s and now,\" said Peter Wadhams of the Cambridge-based Scott Polar Research Institute, who is a veteran of Arctic submarine voyages. \"That's a pretty major decrease. And we're looking at satellite images showing the area of ice to be shrinking too - that's been going down by 5% a decade. At that rate, it will have vanished in 50 years.\" </p> <p>An ice-free Arctic. Should we care? If all the sea ice melts, it won't affect sea levels: an ice cube melting in a drink does not make the drink overflow. Merchant ships would be able to cut almost 5,000 miles off the Europe-Japan sea route by zipping across the North Pole. Oil prospectors and trawlers would move in. Siberians and Canadians would cash in. But it would spell disaster for creatures such as the polar bear; it would mean the end of one of the world's last true wildernesses. And for humankind, it could be the beginning of a great climatic catastrophe. </p> <p>The North Pole has always inspired passion in scientists. The passion to get there first, and the passion to be right about what is happening in the remotest and most mysterious of places. The man long accepted as the first to have reached the pole, Robert Peary, turned out to have wanted the honour so passionately that he lied - it now seems likely that he never got closer than 100 miles from the pole. The first to make it was probably a Soviet airman, Ivan Papanin, and he didn't make it until 1937. </p> <p>The current debate about the causes of Arctic ice-thinning is, appropriately, one of the fiercest and most keenly watched in the whole field of climate change. Computer models of the world's climate predict that if changes take place, they will take place in the Arctic earlier and faster than anywhere else on the planet. The question under dispute is simple: is global warming to blame for the watery pole, or is it part of a separate weather cycle, whereby the ice shrinks and thickens in a regular way over decades? </p> <p>Johnny Johannessen, of the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Centre in Bergen, Norway - where scientists have predicted the demise of the Arctic summer sea ice in 50 years - said: \"It's a challenge to be able to pin down how much ice thickness is changing as a result of global warming and how much is due to atmospheric conditions which, we know, undergo huge changes in the Arctic from decade to decade.\" </p> <p>Dr Wadhams said he was convinced that global warming was the cause. In particular, the ice was being undermined from below by warmer seas. The idea that a change in the winds which shift the sea ice would simply \"flip\" the cycle back to a rethickening of the ice was, he said, unconvincing. \"The balance of probability is that this is a real global-warming effect. It's not going to go back.\" </p> <p>If global warming really is found to be responsible for the melting of the Arctic, it has two sets of consequences - one direct, the other demonstrative. If scientists can point to a shrinking skein of ice floes where valiant explorers once walked with huskies, it will help them to wake up the world to the powerful changes that man-made climate change is capable of making to all our lives. </p> <p>Directly, the disappearance of the shiny white ice at the pole means the loss, for the planet, of a huge reflector, beaming the sun's heat back at it. Open water is darker and absorbs heat better. In other words, the loss of the ice would add to the rise in global temperatures. </p> <p>Another direct consequence is a particularly ugly one for Britain. Global warming is predicted to mean steadily rising temperatures for our islands, bringing Mediterranean balm to the south. But within 100 years, this could change. With the melting of the Arctic ice, some models say, the existing circulation of cold and hot, fresh and salt water in the Atlantic would be dramatically violated. The gulf stream, the current of warm water which keeps our temperatures higher than they should be so far north, would falter and be turned back south of Ireland. Temperatures would sink till they were lower than they are now. </p> <p>As a first, early sign of how global warming can bring real, swift and disturbing change to the world we grew up in, the thinning of the Arctic ice appears as an early warning light, closer to home and bigger than the inundation of little island nations, more clear-cut than the doubtful premise that global warming means more storms. </p> <p>The melting Arctic will not bring flooding directly. But it looks like a sign that melting glaciers in the ancient, kilometres-thick ice caps of Greenland and AntArctica will. Sea levels are predicted to rise by 70cm in the coming century, putting the people of low-lying countries like Bangladesh at ever greater risk of disaster. Rising temperatures will render swathes of semi-arid African land desert, and lead to increased rainfall elsewhere, meaning greater floods. </p> <p>Sceptics of global warming point to the lack of reliable weather records going back more than a century, arguing that it is impossible to distinguish between natural cycles in the weather and man-made changes. Yet examination of ice and sediment samples going back hundreds of thousands of years suggests that, in fact, the recent rises in temperatures are an aberration. </p> <p>Accepted theories about the wobbles in the Earth's orbit, which are thought to cause ice ages, suggest that we can expect our next ice age in 25,000 years time, and that we are approaching the peak of natural warmth in the ice-age cycle. The difference in average global temperature between getting vineyards in Yorkshire and getting glaciers in Scottish glens is very small - only four degrees celsius. In other words, by adding a few degrees to the planet's natural temperature at the time when it is peaking anyway, we are moving into wholly unpredictable territory. </p> <p>Politically and - some scientists fear - practically, there may be little we can do but try to help protect developing countries, which are likely to suffer the hardest, from the consequences of global warming. For the next few generations at least, western Europe and North America are set to experience climate change that is dramatic enough to notice but not dangerous enough to be beyond management, making it still possible to ignore the plight of nations and ecosystems which are more at risk. </p> <p>Not that the changes won't be brought home to our shores in painful ways. \"The 1953 floods on the east coast of England were caused by storm surges,\" said Wadhams. \"If there are higher sea levels to begin with, it will be worse. The chances are there are going to be some disastrous floods on the east coast in the next few years. If I were living near the coast in Suffolk or Essex, I'd really be a bit worried.\" </p> <p><strong>Global warning:</strong>What will happen if the world keeps getting hotter </p> <p>* Increased risk of flooding in Bangladesh: already ravaged by periodic floods, loss of life and property gets worse as the sea level rises. Nile delta also at risk. </p> <p>* Famine in Africa: semi-arid regions in sub-Saharan Africa turn to desert, making the food situation for some of the world's poorest countries worse. </p> <p>* Disease moves north: mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever and encephalitis spread into new territories. </p> <p>* Trouble in New York: ferocious storms become a regular occurrence. Parts of Manhattan experience frequent floods. </p> <p>* The map changes: the Florida everglades are inundated, changing the shape of the US. </p> <p>* Danger in England: rising sea levels combine with storm surges to overcome the sea defences on the east coast. </p> <p>* Birds die: an estimated 24m geese, sandpipers, dunlins and stints have to find new breeding grounds or perish, due to forestation of the Arctic tundra. </p> <p>* Polar bears starve: as global warming melts the Arctic ice, the bears have less chance to fatten up on the seals they catch through the ice - their weight plummets and cubs starve.

  "<p>Of course, we all know perfectly well that Big Brother is morally indefensible - voyeuristic, intrusive, manipulative, cruel and designed to turn real people into soap characters. But every moral objection, every glimmer of theoretical interest you might have about it was anticipated by Psychomobile 1: The World Clock, an installation staged in 1996 by Dogme founder Lars Von Trier. </p> <p>The installation is documented in Jesper Jargil's film De Udstillede (The Exhibited), showing in the Edinburgh film festival this week, and if you ever felt that watching Big Brother was like peering into an ant colony, Jargil's film makes a sobering comparison. Wondering what it would be like if people's behaviour were determined by a system they couldn't control, Von Trier set up a video camera to film an ant colony in New Mexico. The image was transmitted live to a gallery in Copenhagen, where the ants' movements triggered sets of coloured lights in 19 rooms inhabited by 53 actors, watched over a month by a live audience. </p> <p>The actors came equipped only with background information on their characters, exotic oddballs with names like Phi, Emperor, AA, The Cur, Petite 1, Petite 2. They improvised their parts according to the changing lights - a system complicated by the fact that a given colour had an entirely different meaning for each actor. More detailed variables governed particular characters: Richard Bestboy changes personality seemingly at random; anyone touched by Starseed must freeze on the spot. </p> <p>This being a Danish production, and seemingly a dry run for Von Trier's psychodrama The Idiots, the stakes are higher than on Channel 4, offering sex, violence and madness. Otherwise the two productions are remarkably close. As the characters evolve in Psychomobile 1, the actors confess to being increasingly unable to separate the drama from their real emotions, which are often violent (\"There are light changes that changed lives,\" says one actor). </p> <p>Psychomobile 1 cannot, of course, have the real moral consequences of Big Brother, which increasingly resembles a machine for screwing up lives. But while the conventions of the gallery installation protect Psychomobile's audience from the real moral consequences of voyeurism, they don't - as far as you can tell from the film - cut out the rush of emotional danger that both actors and audience are exposed to. If anything, they heighten it. </p> <p>The idea of Psychomobile as a clock regulating the actors' movements makes you realise that Big Brother too is like a clock, and one designed to wind down. In the final weeks, Big Brother's drama will atrophy, its once-crowded stage will be almost deserted and the last few contestants will live out something increasingly resembling a Beckett play filmed according to Dogme rules. Von Trier's players were keen to achieve closure as the installation approached its ending. In the final week, the actors began to worry that the whole thing would end in a bloodbath, with characters killing each other to bring about a show-stopping finale. Come the inevitably lurid climax, one particularly inventive actor broke the rules. When his character was eliminated from the action by a lethal bullet, the actor decided to return covered in talc, as a ghost confronting his murderer. </p> <p>I doubt that option is open to Nick Bateman, but if the Big Brother contestants hear eerie wailing in the dead of night, they'll know why. </p> <p>De Udstillede is at Cameo 2, Edinburgh (0131 623-8030), at 5.30pm on Friday.</p>",

  "So to the land of the real north-south divide, where the border is real rather than metaphorical and what's at stake are not house prices but life and death. For in Ireland the killing has returned - though now it wears a different face. It is no longer a struggle between two sides fighting to erase or preserve that border between north and south. The new Troubles are troubles within - loyalists killing loyalists. <p>One gang attacked the other's parade on Saturday and the familiar revenge tragedy began in earnest: tit for tat, this life for that one, your eye for mine. The combatants are loyalist factions whose names form an alphabet soup of fratricidal rivalry: the UDA and UFF, backed by the UDP, on one side; and the UVF, backed by the PUP, on the other. It could be an Ulster production of Monty Python's Life of Brian - with the People's Front of Judea at daggers' drawn with the Judean People's Front. It could be, except two men were left dead on Monday, and four others have been killed in loyalist feuding these last few months - so no one is laughing. </p> <p>What should those who wish only peace for Northern Ireland - and who had half thought we'd got there - think now? Is this a threat to the peace process or is it internal housekeeping, the equivalent of a mafia war where hoods rub out hoods but \"civilians\" are in no danger? </p> <p>The quick and reassuring answer is that the latest round of violence is an internal matter. It represents a battle for supremacy in the Shankill estate, with the Ulster Freedom Fighters' Johnny \"Mad Dog\" Adair, only recently released from the Maze prison, bidding for turf and power: Mad Dog wants to be top dog. Those on the ground are in little doubt that he is fomenting the current trouble: he wants to be the lord of the Shankill. </p> <p>There is something reassuring about this view. The men may be brutal, their terrain may be benighted, but it seems safely distant from the peace process. After all, and in true Monty Python style, no one can name a doctrinal difference that separates Adair's UFF from the Ulster Volunteer Force which it hates so bloodily. It is not as if they are fighting over the details of the Good Friday agreement. On the contrary, the political wings of both paramilitary organisations were committed to the agreement earlier and with more enthusiasm than David Trimble's officially more moderate Ulster Unionist party. </p> <p>Still, though it may be comforting to see the current bloodletting as a Belfast episode of the Sopranos, it might also be a mistake. For there is danger here for Northern Ireland's fragile peace. </p> <p>For one thing, even though Adair may look like a gangland thug he is not without politics. Under his watch, the UFF and its allies in the Ulster Defence Association have cosied up to the ultra-hardline Loyalist Volunteer Force. Unlike the other organisations, the LVF was never a serious partner in the peace process: it is a rejectionist outfit whose creed was horrific violence. If Adair is taking a movement that was once inside the peace tent and moving it outside, then that is a cause for real alarm. </p> <p>The current violence could derail the peace process in a more direct way. \"The traditional way these things end is by killing some taigs,\" says one watchful republican. He worries that loyalist internecine feuding rarely stays internecine for long: eventually they murder Catholics, if only to assert their status as the chief defenders of their community. Belfast's Catholics will be locking their doors more tightly tonight. </p> <p>But there is a deeper challenge the men of loyalist violence pose to the accord. For what they have exposed are the places where the politicians failed. </p> <p>Start with the opponents of Good Friday. What the last few days prove is that Unionism's hardliners, along with their allies on the British right, were looking in the wrong direction all along. Throughout the 1990s they were obsessed with the IRA; they rarely made a squeak about the armed men of loyalism. </p> <p>They ignored the fact that the most vicious crimes of the Troubles were often committed by men pledging allegiance to the Union flag: witness the 1970s killing spree of the Shankill Butchers. British security sources privately admit that, while they faced in the IRA a disciplined organisation all but run like an army, they often confronted in loyalism men who seemed driven less by politics than psychopathy (or the racketeering pursuit of personal profit). </p> <p>The rejectionists may also have been looking the wrong way when they chose their ground for opposition. The deal-breaker for them was always decommissioning - usually of republican weapons. John Hume kept on saying that disarmament was a red herring: you could give up guns on Monday only to buy new ones on Tuesday. Others quietly warned that the bitterest pill would be the release of prisoners - not just republican killers like those behind the 1984 Brighton bomb, but also the likes of Mad Dog Adair. Yet there was only room in the rejectionists' quiver for one arrow, and they aimed it at guns rather than at the men who might wield them. </p> <p>But it is not just the naysayers who made mistakes. The British and Irish governments can also be faulted for failing to give sufficient support to the leaders who sought to turn the Shankill away from killing and toward politics. Men like the UDP's Gary McMichael and the ultra-impressive David Ervine of the PUP had their work cut out. At least Sinn Fein had a tradition of political republicanism to draw on; McMichael and Ervine were seeking to turn around movements whose entire existence had been dedicated to sectarian violence. The result is that McMichael is fast being eclipsed; he has too little muscle to wrestle the Mad Dog, let alone call him to heel. </p> <p>The peacemakers of loyalism needed some help if they were to take on both their hardmen and their history. Theirs is a society where the language of gradualism and compromise has little appeal; their constituency is the loyalist male who feels left behind by the new economy of Northern Ireland and who misses the old tribal certainties.The politicians can only promise slow, hard answers, while Mad Dog and his gang offer something shorter and sharper. </p> <p>What to do now? One quick remedy is to put Johnny Adair back where he belongs: behind bars. Like all the released prisoners, he was let out on condition. Now that he is failing to comply with the new dispensation, his licence should be withdrawn. He may have made some pro-peace noises when he was in jail but he did that because he wanted to get out: he talked the talk so he could walk the walk. </p> <p>After that, the peacemakers need to help each other - today it's the beleaguered leaders of political loyalism, tomorrow it might be moderate republicans. They can start by boasting of their achievements. Just yesterday, while troops were back on the streets of Belfast, a trade mission arrived from Northern Ireland in Boston. It was led by the Ulster Unionist minister for trade and investment, Reg Empey, and included members of all the province's parties - including Sinn Fein's Pat Doherty, whose links to the IRA are close. Once such a shared mission would have been unimaginable; today it is becoming routine. While the thugs of the Shankill murder each other, the rest of Northern Ireland's people need to remember how far they have come - and to keep their eyes on the prize. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "There have been very few leaders of British industry who could claim, with some irony, that they both pioneered a revolution in the banking system and helped to bring down a Conservative government. But that was the remarkable achievement of Sir Campbell Adamson, who has died aged 78. <p>As director-general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), he was accused of helping to undermine the Heath government during the general election of February 1974. While he rejected the charge out of hand, the story remains full of fascination. </p> <p>Adamson was appointed to his high-profile job in 1969, at a peak of industrial tension between government, employers and trade unions; a year later, Edward Heath's Conservative party swept to power on a platform of reform. The Industrial Relations Act was introduced at the end of 1970 and, at once, ran into huge problems, from which the government was forced to retreat in the face of trade union power. By mid-1972, compromise was in the air, and, throughout 1973, Heath, the CBI and the TUC sought to establish a working relationship. </p> <p>The breakdown of this attempt - caused by the Middle East crisis, oil prices quadrupling overnight and a miners' strike - precipitated the February 1974 election. </p> <p>Two days before polling day, Adamson, in a private speech to the Industrial Society, criticised the rigidity of the government's industrial relations policy. The press had not been invited, but somehow his words slipped out. They caused a political sensation and, after Heath lost the election, he blamed Adamson for contributing to the government's narrow defeat. </p> <p>It was an absurd exaggeration because Adamson had said nothing that was not common knowledge through- out industry - nor, for that matter, inside the Heath government. Even so, Adamson felt duty bound to fall on his sword; he twice tendered his resignation, which was twice rejected. He then took all the flak with great stoicism, nor was there any trace of whinge. Yet the shadow of that occasion always remained at the back of his mind. </p> <p>His other prime slot in history must be his remarkable achievement in pioneering the change in status of the Abbey National Building Society from a mutual to a public company - the first major building society to move in that direction. It was the opening shot in a revolution that transformed Britain's financial services and, to achieve it, Adamson had to overcome tradition, prejudice and fierce opposition from Abbey members. In the end, however, his scheme triumphed by a vote of 9 to 1. </p> <p>Adamson was born in Perth, the only son of a distinguished Scottish accountant, who disliked even the idea of living south of the border - \"true Scots\", as Adamson would describe his family culture, with a touch of characteristic humour. Nonetheless, an attractive job offer persuaded the father to move to England, and send his son to Rugby. Young Adamson went on to Corpus Christi, Cambridge, where he read economics under John Maynard Keynes - an influence which never left him. </p> <p>A hereditary night-blindness kept Adamson out of the war, although he tried everything to get into the armed services. After a brief war-time stint with the Royal Institute of International Affairs, he went into the steel industry. He started in 1945 as a management trainee with Baldwins, in south Wales, and went on to work with the merged Richard Thomas &amp; Baldwin plants, ending up - at the age of 36 - in charge of the construction and operations division of RTB's huge Spencer works at Llanwern. </p> <p>All of that was re-shaped into the Steel Company of Wales (Scow) prior to nationalisation in 1947, at which point Adamson took charge of labour relations. It was his achievements in steel - in particular, the humanity of his management - that drew him to the attention of Harold Wilson's second Labour government, and, in 1967, he was invited to join the still-developing Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), George Brown's ill-fated invention designed to challenge Treasury economic dominance of Whitehall. </p> <p>Adamson was appointed as a senior industrial adviser, in charge of co-ordinating all the other industrial advisers. He was given the temporary status of a deputy under- secretary of state, although, by the time he arrived at the DEA, Brown had moved on and Michael Stewart was in charge of a department that was plainly heading nowhere in particular. </p> <p>After two years, Adamson was glad to leave. Technically, he was still attached to Scow, but, by then, the steel industry had been re-nationalised, and the first chairman of British Steel, Lord Melchett, wanted to appoint him to a senior managerial post. </p> <p>That is when fate and chance intervened. Adamson wanted a holiday between leaving Whitehall and taking up a new job. With his first wife, Gilvray, whom he met at Cambridge and married in 1945, he planned a safari drive across the Sahara - a long cherished ambition. As they were about to depart, John Davies, then director-general of the CBI, rang to suggest that Adamson might be interested in the CBI job, which he was leaving. The Adamsons left for their holiday, leaving post restante addresses in Algiers and Cairo - which is how he first learned he had been appointed director- general of the CBI. </p> <p>A damson's seven years with the organisation were among the most turbulent years for British industry, and the economy, since the war. He always claimed that his biggest achievement was persuading the CBI, in 1971 to 1972, to hold back price rises, without which Heath's pay and prices policy would never have taken off. He was certainly the main architect of that policy, and it helped to halve the inflation rate. </p> <p>Yet, in retrospect, Adamson's most significant legacy was in carrying the CBI in support of Heath's pro-European policies. He was one of the first British industrialists to be convinced of the need to link with Europe, and his leadership was crucial in influencing Britain's largest companies. Interviewed shortly after his departure in 1976, he said he would like to be remembered as \"somebody who helped to put the CBI firmly on the map\". Few could now argue against the view that he achieved precisely that. </p> <p>He also saw nothing to scorn in bringing all sides together to help resolve major social and economic problems. \"A civilised society must have co-operation between government and both sides of industry,\" he argued. </p> <p>A string of appointments in industry, banking and financial institutions followed his departure from the CBI. Then, in 1978, he surprised everyone by taking up the chairmanship of Abbey National - at the age of 56. These years were among the most rewarding of his career, and he played a major role in transforming Britain's financial services and the culture of building societies. </p> <p>Adamson's personal life also went through a period of dramatic change. He separated from Gilvray, a sociologist and social worker, and, in 1984, married a gregarious American, Mimi Lloyd-Chancellor. They were to spend many happy years sharing a remodelled terraced house in Battersea and a country home in Oxfordshire. </p> <p>Adamson was a liberal capitalist with a profound social awareness. He might easily have become a socialist at Cambridge, but rejected what was then politically fashionable. Years later, he claimed - only half jokingly - that it was hearing Herbert Morrison speak about the virtues of the Labour party that put him off. Yet it did not deter him from pursuing a wide range of social activities; one of his most notable contributions was to found, and chair, the Family Policy Studies Centre in 1984, where he appointed Malcolm Wicks, now a Labour MP, as its first director. </p> <p>So many of Adamson's qualities can be gleaned from his Who's Who listing; brass rubbing, music, walking, arguing (in later years, he omitted brass rubbing). No one who walked with him was ever in any doubt about his unusual mix of qualities - immense sensitivity, a strong, ethically-based vision, and mischievous humour coupled with self-deprecation. </p> <p>He is survived by Mimi, and two sons and two daughter from his first marriage. </p> <p>\u0095 William Owen Campbell Adamson, industrialist, born June 26 1922; died August 21 2000</p>",
  "German authorities yesterday sent out a powerful signal of their determination to crack down on the far right when it emerged that the federal chief prosecutor had taken personal charge of the latest trial for race murder. <p>Kay Nehm, whose intervention is usually reserved for cases of suspected terrorism, had earlier said neo-Nazi violence posed a threat to security because of the climate of fear and intimidation it created. </p> <p>Three young men from Dessau in eastern Germany went on trial in the city of Halle yesterday, accused of a killing that has provided an impetus for mounting concern over the far right. Mozambique-born Alberto Adriano died on June 14 after being kicked and beaten as he made his way home in the early hours. </p> <p>His German widow, Angelika, faced the three skinheads yesterday as a prosecutor from Mr Nehm's department opened the case for the state. The victim was the father of three children, aged eight, three, and six months. </p> <p>\"The defendants assumed that Adriano could die as a result of their attack\", Joachim Lampe told the court. \"But their hatred of foreigners made them indifferent to this\". </p> <p>The chief prosecutor's decision was the latest initiative aimed at curbing neo-Nazism, which is rife in the east. It was announced as the chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, began a tour to gain insight into the area's problems. </p> <p>Speaking in Bad Elster on Monday, Mr Schr\u00f6der called on people to stand up to the neo-Nazis to prevent them undoing east Germany's achievements since reunification. </p> <p>In recent weeks, the government has pressed for a ban on the most extreme of the legal right-wing parties, pledged more than \u00a320 million to an anti-racist drive in schools and announced an advertising campaign to encourage tolerance. </p> <p>Manfred P\u00f6chel, the interior minister of the regional government in Saxony-Anhalt, where Mr Adriano was murdered, called for the toughest possible sentence if the defendants were found guilty. </p> <p>Mr Adriano's death was important in galvanising the authorities into action. According to the indictment, his attackers beat then kicked him with their military-style boots for five minutes. They continued kicking him and shouting \"Get out of our country, you Negro pig\", even after Mr Adriano had stopped moving. </p> <p>Enrico Hilprecht, aged 24, sat impassively as the court was told how he had kicked Adriano 10 times in the head. He faces up to 15 years in prison for the killing. </p> <p>He and his co-defendants, Frank Miethbauer and Christian Richter, both 16, were said to have chanced on Mr Adriano as they stormed through Dessau shouting \"Blacks out\". The younger men are liable to receive a shorter sentence of up to 10 years. </p> <p>After the indictment was read, the judge ordered proceedings to continue behind closed doors because of the law regarding juveniles. A lawyer for the victim's family said all three defendants had admitted in closed evidence that they had taken part in the attack. </p> <p>The defence is expected to argue that they were too drunk at the time to be fully responsible. An expert witness is to be called to testify on their condition after they were arrested at the scene of the attack after residents called the police. </p> <p>The link between far-right violence and state security was made earlier this year in a report from the security service that played a role in stirring anxiety. The BVD, Germany's equivalent of MI5, said it had detected terrorist-style organisation among neo-Nazis. </p> <p>Underlying the authorities' disquiet, there are other factors - notably a concern that racism in the east could hinder Germany's integration into a globalised economy. Germany currently accepts some 200,000 newcomers each year. </p> <p>Already this year, the government has offered 20,000 temporary work permits to computer specialists, many of whom it expects to come from the Indian sub-continent. </p> <p><b>Chronology of violence</b></p> <p><b> 1990</b> </p> <p>A 28-year-old Angolan is murdered in the eastern town of Eberswalde, Brandenburg, in what is regarded as Germany's first post-unification race murder. The early 90s are marked by a string of attacks on hostels for immigrants and asylum-seekers. </p> <p><b> 1992</b> </p> <p>Race riots in Rostock. A hostel for Vietnamese is besieged for five days. </p> <p><b> 1993</b> </p> <p>Skinheads beat up a black member of the US luge team in the resort of Oberhof in the former East Germany. </p> <p><b> 1996</b> </p> <p>Two neo-Nazis jailed by a Potsdam court for a racist attack on three black Britons.

  "Lewis Waddilove, who has died aged 85, was a Quaker committed to social change, whose work was at the heart of postwar social housing policies. His integrity and sincerity gave him the authority to confront politicians of all parties, often with unpopular proposals. His campaigning was based on absolute honesty and meticulous attention to detail. <p>Waddilove was the first director, from 1961-79, of what is now the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (previously the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust), and managed its affairs from 1946-79. He had been born into a strong Quaker tradition, was educated at Westcliff high school, Southend, and, although he received a number of honorary degrees, he never took one himself. During the war, he served with the Friends Ambulance Service in the Middle East. </p> <p>When Waddilove first arrived in York, the Rowntree organisation was the Village Trust, concentrating on the model garden village of New Earswick, York, begun by Joseph Rowntree at the turn of the 20th century. Waddilove steered the trust into wider realms, with a private act of parliament that created the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust, covering all aspects of social research and experiment. </p> <p>Today, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation is the largest independent supporter and initiator of social research, spending more than \u00a39m a year, and its housing trust provides 2,000 homes and a range of specialist accommodation, residential and nursing care, and community activities and facilities, in and around York. </p> <p>Just one part of Waddilove's role in expanding the value and influence of the foundation was in establishing the family fund in 1973, at the request of Sir Keith Joseph, then secretary of state for health and social services, to distribute grants to families with severely disabled children. Today, the Family Fund Trust pays out nearly \u00a325m a year. The housing origins of the trust led Waddilove to become a founder trustee of both the British Churches Housing Trust (promoting church-based housing associations) in 1964, and then of Shelter in 1966, where he was later to take the chair. </p> <p>I got to know Lewis Waddilove when I started work at the British Churches Housing Trust in 1968, and it was he who appointed me in 1973 to be director of the National Federation of Housing Associations (today, the National Housing Federation), which he chaired for most of the period 1965-79. At the same time, he served on the board of the Housing Corporation, during the influential years before and after the Housing Act 1974; he was deputy chairman of the corporation from 1978 to 1983. </p> <p>To those of us involved with Shelter, and the newly-formed housing associations of the late 1960s and 1970s, Lewis was more than an elder statesman. He was a mentor and a model. Not for him the placard-waving and the protest marches; he favoured the assembling of evidence, the marshalling of rational argument, the combination of courtesy and persistence in handling the politicians of the day. </p> <p>The fact that housing associations have come to dominate the social housing scene owes an enormous amount to the guiding hand of Lewis Waddilove. His approach was always subtly different from the mainstream. Steeped in the tradition of Joseph Rowntree, he never looked at issues from the top down. Despite his intellectual prowess and establishment appearance - he was always immaculately turned out - he had no sense of superiority; he was determined that the places built by the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust should not bear the stamp of charity, rather being, as Rowntree said, \"self governing communities\". </p> <p>Waddilove championed the idea of housing co-operatives and was critical of local authority housing, where he felt tenants were powerless. To the end, he remained a tenant himself in one of the housing trust's properties in New Earswick. </p> <p>He was also involved in a range of other social policy issues, including commonwealth immigration, reform of the social services, legal aid, rent rebates and allowances, the future of the voluntary sector and much more. He chaired the personal social services council, the BBC/IBA central appeals advisory committee, and the coal-mining subsidence compensation review committee. </p> <p>Incredibly, he also had time for civic duties in York, as a JP, a deeply respected chairman of the York University council, chairman of the Quaker schools (Bootham and The Mount) and as chairman of the York city charities. Always his quiet, sincere style supported the clarity of vision and wise analysis he brought to each subject. </p> <p>The standards Lewis set remain a template: sustain your underlying vision of social change, while handling with precision the everyday tasks of administration; be persistent but always courteous; maintain total integrity, however sophisticated the negotiations; listen carefully and see all sides to the argument before drawing conclusions; deal with people of all kinds with an equal degree of respect. Following even partially in his footsteps is no easy task. </p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Maureen Piper, and by the son and daughter of his first marriage, to Louise Power, who died in 1967. </p> <p>\u0095 Lewis Edgar Waddilove, social policy campaigner, born September 5 1914; died August 21 2000</p>"
