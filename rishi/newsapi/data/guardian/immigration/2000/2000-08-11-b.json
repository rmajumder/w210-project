  "<p><strong> Guilty Victim: Austria from the Holocaust to Haider</strong> by Hella Pick 235pp, IB Tauris, \u00a324.50 <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000241230.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> </p> <p> In the late summer of 1943, British and American intelligence analysts thought they had detected signs that Austria was turning against the Germans. Italy had surrendered, Austria was being seriously bombed for the first time, the casualty lists from the eastern front were lengthening and there was much complaining in what the Nazis called the Ostmark. In an attempt to induce a rising - or at least to cause trouble - the Allies issued the Moscow Declaration, which described Austria as \"the first free country to fall victim to Hitlerite aggression\", pledged to establish an independent Austria after the war and called on Austrians to contribute to their own liberation. </p> <p>It fell on deaf ears. There was no revolt, and no great increase in an internal resistance that had always been modest in scale. But the Moscow Declaration proved of extraordinary significance once peace came. It was the birth certificate of post-war Austria, enshrining a fiction which both the Allies and the Austrians knew to be untrue, but which everybody found so useful that it was maintained for decades. </p> <p>Its consequences are still with us today. In her timely book, Hella Pick skilfully traces the line that, through the twists and turns of nearly 60 years of Austrian and international politics, connects the Declaration to Jorg Haider today. A child refugee from Austria who was brought up in England, Pick later frequently returned as a Guardian correspondent to the country of her birth. She has been on close terms with some of its great men, including Bruno Kreisky and Simon Wiesenthal. One virtue of her account is that it demonstrates how the concept of Austria as victim of the Nazis was, stage by stage, a product of collusion between the new state and its western friends. Another is that it shows how Austria's denial of its Nazi past, and continuing appeasement of those Austrians who clung to that past, perplexingly coexisted with a genuinely humane tradition. That tradition made it a country of refuge for hundreds of thousands fleeing the eastern bloc, a neutral state which took courageous diplomatic initiatives and an admired social and economic model. </p> <p>The Declaration was wrong on every count. Austria was not a free country in 1938, but its citizens freely welcomed the Nazis - and with an enthusiasm that went beyond anything seen in Germany. The Austrian Nazis enrolled proportionally more members during the war years than the party did in Germany. According to one analysis, Austrians, who constituted 8 per cent of the population of Greater Germany, provided 14 per cent of the SS and an amazing 40 per cent of the men in killing units such as those at concentration camps. When the post-war Austrian leadership looked at the problem of de-Nazification it recoiled in horror, for registered Nazis and their families constituted a third of the population. Many of them, of course, were ordinary men and women who could be defined as victims of their times. But the public reconciliation between Austrian conservatives and social demo crats, whose hostility to one another had contributed so much to the country's inter-war troubles, was matched by a hidden compromise with this ex-Nazi constituency. </p> <p>Austrians, the author writes, \"mentally mislaid the Hitler years\", a trick which allowed politicians to work with the parties that drew on that constituency. As she shows, political arrangements with the Freedom Party and its predecessors are nothing new. They were in and out of bed with the the Social Democratic Party for nearly 40 years, until Chancellor Franz Vranitzky brought the alliance to an end when Haider became the Freedom Party leader. Perhaps it is understandable that the Freedom Party complains about being pilloried today for doing what the Social Democratic Party did in the past with only intermittent controversy, both inside and outside Austria. </p> <p>But Haider is a different kind of leader from his predecessors, and the party is no longer on the margins of Austrian politics. What is more, the reasons why the world turned a blind eye have all but disappeared. The cold war is over, Austria is in the European Union, the understanding of the second world war and of the fate of the Jews has shifted and the dangers of xenophobic nationalism have been freshly demonstrated in the Balkans. Furthermore, right-wing extremism is a significant problem in several western democracies. From the mid-80s on, with the scandal over Kurt Waldheim's election as president, the Austrian political establishment has increasingly been ready to face the truth about the past and, belatedly, to offer some restitution. The unhappy fact is that these are precisely the years in which Haider and the Freedom Party have prospered. The problem this represents is not Austria's alone. As in the past, the theatre of Austrian politics is both that of a small and rather provincial country and that of the world - a difficult combination for both sides, as this book makes amply clear.</p>",
  "<p>Unlike many writers who claim that they avoid reading other people's work when they are creating their own, Patricia Duncker says her voracious reading habit is entirely unchanged whether she is writing or not. \"I simply couldn't write if I wasn't reading,\" she explains. \"It would be like working in a void.\" But that said, it was not her love and admiration for books that set her on a literary career. Instead it was rather less straightforward love and admiration for a writer. The poet Patricia Beer, who died last year, was her aunt. The two women had a difficult personal relationship, but Beer was undoubtedly Duncker's main influence. \"Not in terms of what I write but in how I think,\" Duncker says. \"If you look, a lot of writers do seem to have another writer somewhere in their lives. She was the writer in mine.\" </p> <p>Duncker was brought up in 1950s Jamaica, where her mother was English and a teacher, and her father was Jamaican and a businessman. She remembers her \"sexy aunt\" visiting and representing everything that Europe stood for. \"She was glamorous and widely travelled and extremely well read. I showed her my poems when I was about 12 and she was the first person to take me seriously. She told me, very politely, what was good and what was nonsense.\" </p> <p>Childhood reading was idiosyncratically colonial. Along with the obligatory Kipling, by the age of 10 Duncker had also read Winston Churchill's History of the Second World War and Fitzroy Maclean's Conversations with Tito . \"I read them as adventure stories,\" she laughs. \"But when I went to school in England aged 13 I had to catch up pretty quickly with Malory Towers and things like that.\" </p> <p>She went on to read English at university and then did post-graduate work on English and German romanticism. She now teaches English and writing at the University of Wales in Aberystwyth but she always \"had it in my head that I wanted to be a writer. I had been instructed by Patricia that this is what I should do, so it was a little like a Mission: Impossible assignment where, once I had accepted, I just had to get on with it\". </p> <p>Duncker says that Beer, who was her guardian when she arrived in England, never actually liked her, and certainly didn't pass comment on her mature writing. \"But even if we didn't talk together about writing, I read everything she wrote and she has shaped my mind. I hugely admire her ruthless imagination. There is a real ice-queen chill in her writing. And she taught me a commitment to excellence: never be sloppy, go to the sixth, seventh, eighth revision, leave your best scenes on the cutting-room floor. Work work work.\" </p> <p>This stringent approach has contributed to Duncker still having an unpublished three-volume novel in a drawer at home, as well as bundles of unseen poetry. She thinks more novels that do see the light of day should be kept in drawers, and claims even if she never had anything published she would continue to write. \"Some of the people I most admire were never published in their lifetime, like Emily Dickinson. Even Emily Bront\u00eb didn't want to publish.\" </p> <p>Duncker's first novel, Hallucinating Foucault , was eventually published in 1996. Part thriller, part love story, part philosophical exploration, it was widely acclaimed and picked up a series of first-novel prizes. She says that while it is obviously gratifying to win prizes, the most exciting thing is to have more readers. \"I know how thrilling it is for me to read a book that excites me, so to think I might have given that pleasure to someone else is wonderful.\" </p> <p>Her collection of short stories, Monsieur Shoushana's Lemon Trees , was published in 1997 and the paperback edition of her second novel, James Miranda Barry , comes out this month. Duncker had initially used the true story of the 19th-century military doctor who lived her life as a man in her very first piece of published writing. It appeared in a 1989 anthology of short stories, but her subsequent attempt to write a novel based on the character stalled after 100 pages when she couldn't resolve the problem of saying \"him\" or \"her\" in the narration. In 1997 she tried again and, using both first and third-person narration, cracked the technical problems. The resulting book is an absorbing literary-historical novel that probes with an exuberant intelligence the complex relationship between what things are and what they seem. </p> <p>Duncker's next project is editing a volume of short stories written by women in Wales, and she will then complete a new novel. \"It's set in the contemporary world but will be very gothic and very scary. I love the horror genre. I think the reason crime fiction has become so respectable is that the French literary establishment has thrown its weight behind it, but this hasn't happened yet with horror. There are so many possibilities and resonances.\" </p> <p>Not least in her own life. She says Patricia Beer was something like a doppelg\u00e4nger for her. \"I was named after her and people say we sound the same. She has been a sort of shadow, and I think I have always written both for her and against her. While I didn't get on with her as a person, I really, really admired her as a writer. So much so that it has been a pain to me that I have never been able to say so. She was quite a dangerous person to know and she would have taken it as a sort of attack. But I can't overstate how much she goes on being important to me.\" </p> <p>\u0095 To order a copy of James Miranda Barry (Picador, rrp \u00a36.99) for \u00a34.99 plus 99p p&amp;p call Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.</p>",
  "<p> It is, of course, the name of the ship in which Sir Ernest Shackleton voyaged to the Antarctic at the start of the first world war, intending to cross it overland. But the ship was first trapped, then crushed by ice. The title really describes what happens next to the crew, cast away on a drifting ice pack. Scott's doomed venture may be more famous, but Shackleton's 650-mile bid to cross the appalling Weddell Sea in a lifeboat to raise help in South Georgia will never be topped for sheer courage and will to survive. Lansing's 1956 narrative weaves first-hand survivors' accounts into a gripping day-by-day account of peril. Tim Pigott-Smith gives it a superb white-knuckle reading, finding the perfect voice and delivery for the long-haul adventure. You'll feel your car icing up, but you won't want to stop. If you listen to anything on holiday, it has got to be this ultimate survival story. </p>",
  "<p><strong> Mexico City, by Nick Caistor (Signal, \u00a312)</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502319094.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> From \"Cities of the Imagination\", a modest series of companions that shame the shelves of greedy guidebooks promising you can possess places through 48 hours of consumption. Caistor is obsessed by every besmogged metre of his chosen metropolis, sinking in its lake clay foundations: by Posada, engraver of skeletons at the fiesta, whose grandson who lives still in the family house (his umbilical cord is buried in the garden); by Astrid Hadad's cabaret act mocking rancheras , the country music of the nostalgic urban poor; by the Nahua-speakers of the brickworks of Mixcoac, who bewitched the childhood of Octavio Paz among mud and ochreous dust. Wow. </p> <p> <strong> World Food: Mexico, by Bruce Geddes (Lonely Planet, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p> We loathe LP guidebooks (see above) but for all the \"sit here, eat that, be an instant expert\" approach, the powerful sensuality of Mexican food still bursts through the been-there, stained-the-T-shirt tone. The exuberant snaps of markets connect with the happiness the promise of a full belly still confers; the basic salsa recipe is great, as is the culinary dictionary at the back. Geddes does a graceful mini-interview with Laura Esquivel (author of Like Water For Chocolate ), while he and she grind the maize in an ancient stone metate to make corn tortillas in her kitchen in Coyoacan. He's way too pompous, but we enjoyed the pleased shock of him really connecting with her. </p> <p> <strong> Mexican Tiles, by Masako Takahashi (Chronicle Books, \u00a312.99)</strong> </p> <p> Technically one of the San Francisco Chronicle 's design picturebooks, with an acute concern for detail: the cutout cover, the shots of a wedding party leaving a rustic, baroque church or of unglam washing-up liquid by less-than-perfect sinks. Then, as we read the captions, we began to notice how norteamericanos regarded Mexico - all those New York artists with holiday homes in San Miguel de Allende, those bed-and-breakfasts in Cuernavaca with tiled bathrooms for gentlefolk from Maine going south for the artfully simple life. Seldom has the love-hate between the US and Mexico been better caught, nor the sense that Mexican poverty has preserved its daily vivacity. </p>",
  "<p><strong> Idioglossia</strong> by Eleanor Bailey 381pp, Doubleday, \u00a316.99 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502441440.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> Is madness more than \"feeling not how others felt\"? Can you be held responsible for giving your child a loveless upbringing if you were unloved as a child? And when dysfunctional patterns have been laid down over the generations, can a family find the capacity to change? Idioglossia , Eleanor Bailey's first novel and a domestic saga for the Prozac generation, worries at these enormous, intimate questions through the relationships of four generations of unhappy women. It's an ambitious project, attempted through a series of flashbacks covering 90 years, and a multiplicity of voices from the mundane to the maddened. </p> <p>The primary matriarch is sour, ancient Edie, expert emotional manipulator; her loathed daughter Grace, lost to schizophrenia, is the significant absence at the heart of the book. Then there's Grace's middle-aged daughter, Maggie, who was raised in isolation on a cruise ship after her mother's incarceration; finally, Maggie's unwanted daughter Sarah, drifting miserably through careerless confusion and detached casual sex. </p> <p>It is thirtysomething Sarah, born into an age of stability and affluence, who has suffered least, expects most and rages hardest: \"Nobody used to have time to have this depression,\" spits Edie of her great-granddaughter. But Sarah cannot identify her constant low-level upset: \"I have nothing to complain about and that is pre cisely my complaint... I have choices: real coffee, 24-hour supermarkets, freedom and daytime television. And none of them does it for me. The joke is that I'm still totally fucked off.\" </p> <p>It's too late for Edie, and a lifetime too late for Grace. Maggie has a chance of happiness, though, with Sarah's father, back after 30 years to challenge the self-protective order of her life. And so does Sarah with the reclusive Alex, also hugging a childhood trauma, who is as uncomfortable with intimacy as she is. Both couples find a haven in each other, a chance to be childlike that was strangled in childhood. They play games fiercely, banter, speak in riddles, sharing the private language or \"idioglossia\" of the title. </p> <p>But the most accomplished sections of this almost overstuffed book deal with the relationships between the women themselves. Bailey has a sophisticated ear for familial torture -Edie's vicious assurances that they'll all end up in the loony bin/never get a man/be sorry when she dies - and doesn't flinch to unpack the venom between Maggie and Sarah, the petulant \"I hate you\" of the daughter receiving a fervent \"I hate you too\". </p> <p> Idioglossia is oddly sweet-and-sour in tone, strong on misery but also on sentiment. And despite the deftly woven architecture of mirrors, mazes, riddles and games, the subject matter stretches the breezy writing style to breaking point, throwing up such awful sentences as \"There came, as always, a sense of renewal with the dawn\". The undeveloped, sub-Kate Atkinson supernatural elements are a distraction from the exploration of inner terrors. </p> <p>The novel is crammed with escapes from the world - Grace's asylum, Maggie's cruise-ship childhood, Alex's book-lined retreat, the board and card games all the characters love - but finally Idioglossia puts with conviction a happier alternative: what Vonnegut called the nation of two, escape into intimacy with another.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Liberace</strong> by Darden Asbury Pyron<br> 502pp, University of Chicago Press, <strong>\u00a319.50 </strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502430525.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> Before I read this book I knew, from having seen his shows in Cleveland and in Chicago, that Liberace put on the act of a camping queen. And I knew about his libel case against the Daily Mirror , when he was asked: \"Are you a homosexual?\" \"No,\" Liberace replied. \"Have you ever indulged in homosexual practices?\" \"No, sir, never in my life.\" </p> <p>Both of these answers were lies, yet the jury believed him and he won the case. The author of this biography, Darden Asbury Pyron, admits they were lies. He then describes several ways in which they could be construed as not really being lies, citing Proust, Foucault and Rousseau for the defence. It all rings hollow, like much about his subject: Liberace never admitted his homosexuality. He consistently denied, though he knew better, that he had Aids. He died on February 4, 1987. </p> <p>There is no need for revisionism because of that. I have spoken to sad but kindly men on the Mirror and other newspapers who have met every celebrity arriving from the United States in the past 30 years. They all say that this deadly, winking, sniggering, snuggling, chromium-plated, scent-impregnated, luminous, quivering, giggling, fruit-flavoured, mincing, ice-covered heap of mother love had the biggest reception and impact on London since Chaplin arrived in 1921. </p> <p>This appalling man - and I use the word appalling in none other than its true sense of terrifying - hit the country as violently as Churchill receiving the cheers on VE Day. He reeked with the kind of emetic language that can only make grown men long for a quiet corner, an aspidistra, a handkerchief and the old heave-ho. </p> <p>Slobbering over his mother, winking at his brother and counting the cash every second, this superb piece of candyfloss had an answer for every situation. Nobody has purveyed a bigger slagheap of lilac-covered hokum. And nobody has ever made so much money out of high-speed piano playing, with the ghost of Chopin gibbering at every note. There must have been something wrong with us, that our teenagers longing for sex and our middle-aged matrons fed up with sex should have fallen for such a sugary mountain of jingling claptrap. </p> <p>The biography reports the so-called \"affair\" with Joanne Rio that appeared to be not an affair at all - rather an attempt to overcome the reports of homosexuality. Liberace also dated Sonja Henie and Mae West, both gay men's icons. Scott Thorson, Liberace's live-in lover for six years, later sued for palimony, the first suit of its kind. His own lawyers advised against taking the case to court, and eventually he dropped the suit. </p> <p>Then of course there are the trimmings, all of which are listed here: the outrageous costumes, the piano-shaped swimming pool, the grin that seemed riveted to his face. In the 20-odd photos, the perpetual grin is in 18 of them. </p> <p>It could have been different. Pyron states that the young Liberace was influenced by the Polish pianist Ignace Jan Paderewski. At one point the young boy played for Paderewski, who was quoted as saying \"some day this young man will take my place\". There were some similarities in our careers - I, too, was influenced by Paderewski, and was expelled from music college for playing his early hit Yes, We Have No Bananas at a graduation ceremony. But as a musician, I just could not respect Liberace's music. It was speed for speed's sake, flashy technical acrobatics, and to me no more than that. This book doesn't change my mind.</p>",
  "<p> <a href=\"#a\">Role of English</a> | <a href=\"#b\">Teaching</a> | <a href=\"#c\">Living</a> | <a href=\"#d\">Points to remember</a> | <a href=\"#e\">Useful contacts</a> </p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br> Once dismissed as a barren outcrop of rocky islands by senior British officials when first annexed in the C19th, Hong Kong is now a densely packed, vibrant metropolis, a fascinating blend of Western and Asian culture, languages, fashion and food, squeezed into little more than 1000sq km. </p> <p>The territory consists of Hong Kong Island, the political and administrative centre, the New Territories, a larger area made up of new towns, quaint fishing villages and beautiful country parks, and the Outlying Islands, including Lantau where the huge international airport Chek Lap Kok is located. </p> <p>The climate is tropical monsoon: very hot and humid from April through to October, with temperatures regularly hitting the mid-30s C, warm in the autumn, and damp and cool during the winter months. The weather from November to January is usually pleasant enough to hike the excellent trails in the New Territories and on Lantau, or to explore some of the two hundred islands dotted around Hong Kong's territorial waters. </p> <p>The newly-arrived picture Hong Kong as a heaving concrete jungle, heavily polluted and packed with shops, banks and restaurants. And they're right, but luckily escape to the countryside is easy. Sailing, windsurfing, camping, and hiking are all popular leisure pursuits in the Sai Kung Country Park, located in the northeast corner of the New Territories. Birdwatchers rave about the Mai Po Bird Sanctuary near the border with Mainland Chinese and diving and dolphin watching are also possible in the South China Sea. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Hong Kong can be claustrophobic. Many new teachers, especially those with no previous experience in Asia, suffer a certain amount of culture shock due to the fast pace of life, the ever-present construction noise, the jam-packed public transport, and the lack of 'western-style' service in restaurants and shops. But if you don't mind the waiter casually dumping the chopsticks on the table or the shop assistants ignoring you, you'll be fine. The HK Chinese temperament is abrupt and direct; it is easy to mistake this characteristic for rudeness. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"a\"> Role of English</a></strong><br> Hong Kong is officially bilingual, with English and Cantonese as the main languages, and Mandarin as the third. English plays a major part in daily life, especially in business, education, and the law. In fact, since Hong Kong law is based on the British judicial system, cases are still tried in English with the non-English speaking accused relying on translators for information. </p> <p>The role of English in HK society has been the subject of intense debate over the last few years, especially among parents and teachers who believe English-medium schools are more prestigious, even though the use of English might have lowered education standards since many children cannot understand their teachers. When the HK government ordered several English-medium schools to revert to mother tongue education in 1998, the Education Department was flooded with complaints from mothers and fathers demanding that their children be taught in English. However, initial research suggests overall education standards are improving in schools using Cantonese as the medium of instruction. Either way, there is a great demand for qualified and experienced ELT specialists in the SAR. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"b\">Teaching</a></strong><br> There are several options for EFL teachers in Hong Kong. The universities probably offer the best jobs in terms of pay, career prospects and conditions. Salaries start at around GBP 22,000 and can rise to around GBP 60-70 000 for senior teaching staff. Benefits include medical and dental insurance, an average of six weeks paid annual vacation, and access to decent library, sports and eating facilities on campus. Good conditions, though, mean vacancies do not open up very often; when they do, competition is fierce. Jobs are advertised on the universities' homepages, in the <a href=\" http://www.scmp.com/\">South China Morning Post</a>, as well as in various international publications. </p> <p>The Native English Teacher (NET) scheme employs ELT educators for government subsidized schools throughout Hong Kong. The main attraction for teachers is the pay, generous leave, a GBP 1100 a month housing allowance, and a 15% gratuity payable after completing a two-year contract, but the actual conditions are less appealing since there are no realistic prospects of promotion within the system and the teaching itself can be very challenging. </p> <p>One of the problems is many Netters, as they are affectionately known, earn more than their Chinese counterparts, causing some friction and resentment within the staff room. The Netter is sometimes the only <em>gweilo </em> (affectionate Cantonese term for foreigners meaning 'white ghost') in the school and it is not uncommon to feel isolated. An additional problem is that Netters are randomly assigned schools and cannot choose the location or Band. Given a choice, most teachers would opt for either Band 1 or 2, schools for the 'brighter' pupils, because the students there are less likely make your life hell. The same cannot be said for Band 5 schools, which shelter many pupils with discipline and behavioural problems. </p> <p>\"I've had to deal with abusive students, kids that just come in and put their head on their desk and sleep, and very little motivation,\" reports Dan Griffiths, a teacher in a Band 5 secondary school in the New Territories. In contrast, Jane Southurland, an Australian primary school teacher, says \"teaching in the higher banded secondary schools can be rewarding because the kids are more forthcoming.\" It's a bit of a lottery, but if you are patient, tough, and want to pay off your mortgage, the NET scheme is available. </p> <p>The <a href=\" http://www.britcoun.org.uk/\">British Council</a> employs a number of teachers for its adult, children and Business English classes, and runs certificate and diploma courses for teachers at different stages of their careers. </p> <p>International and English Foundation schools are also well respected and offer good conditions to suitably qualified professionals. </p> <p>In addition to teaching, teachers who want to stay in the field but would like to work in another area of ELT can find interesting jobs in the local press. Many of the well-known textbook publishers, such as the OUP and Pearsons, have offices in Hong Kong and occasionally advertise for editors or marketing personnel. Over the last few years, several multimedia companies specializing in the development of educational software and web design have emerged and for the more academically inclined, universities need research assistants to manage research projects. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"c\">Living</a></strong><br> Housing is a perpetual problem for teachers in Hong Kong. While senior staff receive a housing allowance, most English language teachers struggle with high rents for cramped quarters. In centrally located districts such as Midlevels you should expect to pay around GBP 1000 for a habitable 550-700 sq. ft flat; in the cheaper areas requiring a long commute such as Lamma Island or Sai Kung, rents hover around the GBP 600 a month mark for a 700 square foot flat. You'll also need to put down two months' rent as a deposit, pay the property agent 50% of the rent as commission, and buy furniture if you are not keen on the circa1973 kitsch found in many semi-furnished flats. </p> <p>Eating out and drinking in Hong Kong can be fun but expensive. All major cuisine from around the world are represented in the hundred of restaurants in Lan Kwai Fong, Kowloon and Wanchai, as well as some of the less well-known such as Burmese and Nepalese. Cantonese food is very good and Sundays are great for checking out the various dim sum restaurants. And whereas Chinese people are less inclined to drink heavily at the weekends, the western-style bars are crammed full, especially Friday nights during Happy Hours. </p> <p>If you don't drink and you eat at home, Hong Kong is an affordable place to live. Shopping for food is cheap if you stick to the local markets, but if you're squeamish about watching vendors chop off the legs of live frogs or cut open live fish, use the two major supermarket chains, Parknshop and Wellcome, both very affordable. Public transport is easy to use, cheap and clean, and basic utilities such as water, gas and electricity are also reasonable. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"d\"> Points to Remember</a></strong><br> Chinese students are relatively passive when compared to their European or South American counterparts. The secondary school system is exam-oriented and the students are not usually encouraged to be creative or think independently. Students can seem bored, listless, and demotivated, a constant source of frustration for teachers. </p> <p>Hong Kong is very high-tech oriented and teachers should have more than basic computer skills since a lot of communication takes place via the internet and email. </p> <p>The pollution in Hong Kong is not getting any better and despite pressure from environmental groups the government does not appear to be tackling the problem of poor air quality. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"e\"> Useful Contacts</a></strong><br> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org.hk\">British Council</a>, 3, Supreme Court Road, Admiralty, Hong Kong.

  "<b>Clear the air</b> <p>When I was in my early 20s, a close friend of mine became severely ill. As in your case, her family offered support whilst most of her friends let her down, myself included. She was furious that the world kept turning round whilst her life had stopped. The fact that we lived in different countries didn't help. How could I share my own trite preoccupations with her when she lived in a realm of life and death issues? I was told that my letters provoked anger and disgust. I felt guilty for carrying on with my life and resented her for this guilt. I simply didn't have a clue how to be a good friend to her.</p> <p>I now judge my behaviour as at worst selfish and insensitive, and at best desperately out of touch. Sadly, most of us are not equipped to handle illness in others. Most problems in other people's lives enable us to give advice and thus feel useful. Illness is unfair and unexplainable, and leaves us feeling powerless. Your friends might feel embarrassed to mention things you can no longer do. Their good health might strike them as an insult to you. Ignoring the issue is both the easiest response to slip into and the most damaging.</p> <p>My friend later pointed out to me that I should have looked into how her illness was affecting me. Indeed, this is where the yoke hurt. Instead of the lofty, altruistic feelings one imagines should flow naturally, her illness brought into focus the messy issues in our relationship. My friend eventually confronted me with recriminations. This came as a great relief: her aggression allowed me to air my own ugly feelings. We gradually came to understand, and accept, each other's side of the story.</p> <p>Perhaps your friends also need to hear how disappointed you are with them and how much you miss them. Chances are they are guilt-ridden and will, eventually, welcome the opportunity to own up to this. If they don't, at least you will have let them know what terrible friends they are. Name and address withheld</p> <p><b>Time will tell</b></p> <p>I have been disabled from birth but have managed to lead a normal life. I have made many friends over the years but am sure I must have met many people who couldn't cope with my disability and dropped the acquaintance at an early stage.</p> <p>I have never found it much use to try to \"educate\" people about my disability as, if you give them too much information, some people come to see you as a symbol of your condition rather than the unique individual that you are. Perhaps it is better to ask for help when the need arises, have a laugh over clumsy mishaps (\"Drunk again!\") and hope people get the picture eventually. However, you obviously can't do this with friends who won't see you.</p> <p>Meeting new people through voluntary work has helped a little and I am sure you will make new friends too. Perhaps you could keep track of your old friends for a time via the third parties you mention. When they get over the shock and hear how well you are coping, maybe they will come back to you. Name and address withheld</p> <p><b>It's your call</b></p> <p>I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis two years ago. While most of my friends were supportive, others found it so awkward that they avoid mentioning it even now and a few simply lost touch. </p> <p>You say you miss your friends terribly, even though they have felt unable to support you when you need them most. If so, you should get in touch as your happiness is more important than anything else at the present time. It may be that some of your former friends are missing you but waiting for you to make the first move and, sadly, it is you who will have to be strong enough to contact them rather than the other way round. </p> <p>You may find that some will not want to renew the friendship. However, if you re-establish contact with only one of these people, you will have gained something. While I can see your partner's view, I have found that with so many changes in my life I have desperately wanted to hold on to my old friends. It will make you feel stronger if you take the difficult but positive step of contacting them and letting them see that you are still the same person that they once knew. I wish you luck. <b>L Thomson, </b>London</p> <p><b>Safety in numbers</b></p> <p>My first reaction when I read your letter was that these people were never your friends at all, but of course they were. You have deep affection for them, you've shared all sorts of confidences with them, perhaps you've helped each other through rough patches. But now they're being called upon for support that they feel ill-equipped to provide. </p> <p>Perhaps this was the kind of fairweather friendship which is based on having fun together, and you were just as shallow as them. But often in those kinds of friendships there is a quieter, wiser member who stabilises the group. It sounds as if you might have been in that role: the one to whom the others turned when things weren't going so well. If so, your friends are in a quandary - the very person to whom they would turn for advice on how to provide support is the person who needs that support.</p> <p>You may well be in a better position than them, at least as far as friendships go. You'll find that going for treatment, etc, will give you access to a whole new range of people, some of whom you may bond with just as closely as your old set. </p> <p>But if you don't want to lose that original group, why not invite them all round together? They will feel less uncomfortable and if you can make the effort to be as cheerful as possible you might break the ice and allow them to overcome their fears. Just because you have a disability does not mean you are needy with nothing to give: the most supportive and giving friend I ever had died of her disability 15 years ago, and I still miss her friendship and wisdom. <b>Kate Viscardi, </b>Herts</p> <p> <b>Next week</b></p> <p>Last year my mother died and I moved home to look after my two younger brothers, who were 15 and 18. I was 26. My father remarried after he and my mother divorced 17 years ago and lives in another city. We thought it best that I move in to see the boys through their education - the youngest was in his final GSCE year and the elder had just finished his A levels. I, therefore, crossed the bridge from being sister to mother overnight. </p> <p>This summer, after his exams, my youngest brother moved in with our dad and is having a terrible time settling in. I desperately want to call him all the time to see how he is and about his concerns with our dad. However, I'm aware that I shouldn't step on our dad's toes now that he's the parent, but at the same time I have been my brother's mother for a year and feel compelled to help him. </p> <p>Ordinarily, I would be the sister and so would step back and let my father sort things out, but through tragic circumstances, I was forced into a parenting role. I have no children of my own: my only experience is with my brothers. I feel confused about my role now: should I stand back or help my brother?</p> <p>Private Lives appears every Friday.

  "When you live in the same house as Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, said recently, be prepared for surprises. Needless to say, Milosevic's surprises are always unpleasant, as Djukanovic found when the Serbian leader earlier this summer rigged the constitution to allow himself two more potential terms as president of rump Yugoslavia and to demote Montenegro in the changed federal institutions. <p>Among others also recently surprised by Milosevic are the unfortunate Britons and Canadians picked up this month on the border between Kosovo and Montenegro and now before a military court in Belgrade. The two surprises are connected. The four foreigners have been assigned bit parts in a drama of encirclement staged by Milosevic, a drama in which Djukanovic has one of the larger roles. The ruthless survivor in Belgrade has created in Serbia an atmosphere of paranoia that is even more irrational than that which prevailed 10 years ago as Yugoslavia's wars were germinating. Serbia is under constant attack, he gives his nation to understand, just as he himself, as their leader, is physically threatened. </p> <p>In Milosevic's world, teams of assassins are paid by the French to kill him and his associates, Serbian journalists operate as covert agents for the west, and the neighbouring republic of Montenegro is swarming with traitors, foreign spies, mercenaries, and British SAS men. Serbs may not altogether believe in this picture of the unrelenting hostility of most of the outside world, but it nevertheless plays to their vulnerabilities.</p> <p> \"Their fears,\" a recent report by a Bulgarian institute concluded, \"are... for their biological survival because of the collapse of the health system, of environmental pollution and radiation after the air raids, of civil war, of political repression, of isolation.\" Again and again the investigators were told that the nation is \"sinking to the bottom\". The report suggests that both the educated elite and ordinary people are involved in a process of self-examination leading in many cases to deep regret over the events of the last decade and to a repudiation of Milosevic. That regret does not rule out, of course, blaming the Nato countries as well as Milosevic. </p> <p>The irony is that people are so cast down that many still respond to his politicking, even while knowing or half-knowing that he is both responsible for their ills and has no solution to them. Life in Serbia, with its frequent assassinations, its criminalised economy, its utter lack of political transparency, is a dangerous mystery for most ordinary folk. When people are unsure of everything, they are often ready to accept the most outrageous conspiracy theories as explanations for their condition.</p> <p>On this basis, anyway, Milosevic proceeds with his dismal career. In order to maintain the illusion that the world, or at least Nato, is bent on Serbia's destruction, he has this year actively attacked the independent media, whereas in the past he had been content to manipulate them and limit their influence. No critical questioning must be allowed to break through the paranoid fog. For the same reason, all but the extreme nationalist opposition is portrayed as traitorous. Posters in Belgrade picture members of the youth movement Otpor (Resistance) as Nazi troopers. </p> <p>In order to remove any hopes that there would be a constitutional limit to his rule, he pushed through changes to the constitution mandating direct elections for the presidency, lifting the one-term limit, and reducing Montenegrin representation in a new federal assembly. At home in Serbia the intention was to create what all repressive regimes need, which is the sense that there is no end in sight. In Montenegro, the purpose was to gain advantage in his duel with Djukanovic and to discomfit the Nato countries.</p> <p>The result in Montenegro is that the elections under the changed constitution will be held there next month without any help from the Montenegro government. Polling booths will be in Yugoslav army camps or in the municipalities controlled by the Socialist People's party, led by Momir Bulatovic, Djukanovic's rival and supporter of Milosevic. Elsewhere, in areas where Djukanovic's party holds sway, there will be no voting arrangements, for the Montenegrin government has declared that the constitutional changes are illegal and invalid. This half-and-half election is bound to increase the polarisation of Montenegro between those who want to maintain the Serbian connection and those who want to limit or cut it. In June, local elections in two key towns showed how finely balanced the two forces are, with one going to the government and the other to Bulatovic's people.</p> <p>The polarisation reflects historical differences between \"Whites\" who were for Montenegro's absorption into the Yugoslav kingdom in 1918, and \"Greens\" who wanted to remain independent, and regional differences between north and south. It is also the result of a power struggle between two ex-communist cliques and their leaders, once close colleagues, Djukanovic and Bulatovic. Increasingly it has a military dimension, with young men of pro-Milosevic background signing up for reserve units of the national army, and their opposite numbers registering with the Montenegrin police. The two sides have regular forces of perhaps 20,000 men each.</p> <p>Would Milosevic take his campaign to the point of war? He will of course win his election both in Serbia and Montenegro and could then argue that, with new institutions in place, Djukanovic had no legitimate role and ought to go. If Milosevic used force, he might well get away with it as far as the Nato countries are concerned. The doubts of some countries about the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Kosovo intervention would be one reason why Nato action might prove to be impossible. The fact that Montenegro is, after all, legally connected to Serbia and is well known to be genuinely divided on the question of that connection, would be another. Nor is it likely that there would be a humanitarian excuse for action, like that provided by the refugee exodus out of Kosovo. Finally, Djukanovic and his opportunistic government, which depends on income from smuggling to sustain itself, are not easily romanticised.</p> <p>Milosevic is tactically very shrewd. A war between cousins might test the loyalties of both his and Djukanovic's troops to destruction, and lead to grave further disillusion in Serbia. It is not necessary, since the Djukanovic government is more of an irritant than a real challenge to Belgrade. The chances are that he will keep away from war, but it cannot be ruled out. A relatively easy victory, with fighting kept to a minimum, could buttress Milosevic's rule and sustain his myth. A \"Nato agent\" would have been removed and the alliance that so damaged Serbia shown to be impotent. America's preoccupation with its own elections might seem to Milosevic to provide an opportune moment. It is going to be another dangerous autumn in the Balkans. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.woollacott@theguardian.com\">martin.woollacott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "One of the lessons learned fast by the plotters in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar is that a mob, once aroused, will not easily be stood down: it cannot be switched on and off. The organisers of the protests in the Portsmouth estate of Paulsgrove will know by now if that rule still holds. Yesterday they asked the crowds to suspend their anti-paedophile protests, which had grown increasingly violent, and talk instead with the local council. \"Have a night off, stay at home, see to your children, clean your house,\" said the protesters' spokesman, Barry Pettinger. But he added that it was not wholly up to him: \"We do not control the people.\" <p>What Mr Pettinger seemed to be recognising was the same fact which had caused such alarm beyond Paulsgrove: that this was a mob out of control. The smashing of windows, the burning of cars, the hurling of petrol bombs, even at police - coupled with the sight of young children chanting \"hang 'em\" - had sent a chill through all those aware of the frailty of public order. Labour MP Robin Corbett has even suggested prosecution of the News of the World, whose 'naming and shaming' of paedophiles has been blamed for igniting Paulsgrove. <br><br> And yet the protesters will enjoy some sympathy around the country. After the murder of Sarah Payne, many parents share their sense of anger and anxiety, fear and powerlessness at the presence of child abusers among them. If it is true, as they claim, that Paulsgrove has been used as a dumping ground for convicted molesters, then they have every right to be furious. And when they insist that they know which individuals are interfering with their children, they may have a point: such local knowledge is not always wrong. </p> <p>The fact that the demonstrators sat down for talks yesterday is welcome. Perhaps they will be persuaded by the police evidence that they have repeatedly hounded the innocent, torching the homes and wrecking the lives of people who have nothing to do with child abuse. Perhaps, too, they will accept that their actions have actually increased the risk to their children, by driving paedophiles underground where they cannot be monitored. Maybe they will even realise that paedophilia is not a single enemy: that there are some abusers whose behaviour, though indecent and vile, does not represent a homicidal threat to children.</p> <p>But there are grounds for pessimism. For what this stand-off has exposed is the chasm that divides the 3,000 or so estates (the government's figure) like Paulsgrove from the more affluent, sheltered parts of Britain where calmer discussion prevails. The liberal arguments familiar in newspapers, TV studios, parliamentary tea rooms and bishops' studies cut no ice among the boarded-up stores and sub-standard housing of Paulsgrove. For them, the distinction between a convicted and suspected paedophile is academic: \"Either way, we just want them out of here,\" said one of the protesters' leaders on Wednesday. What might be the evidence against someone convicted of no crime? \"Word of mouth,\" she said. What might count elsewhere as the basic principles of a civilised society are a foreign language in Paulsgrove.</p> <p>This, then, is the real meaning of social exclusion. Thousands of estates have been allowed to become dustbins for the rest of society, out of sight and, until a moment like this one, out of mind. Now they are getting together, bonding as a community - if not in quite the way the prime minister and all his communitarian rhetoric envisaged. There are dangers here, and not just from those who abuse children.</p>"
