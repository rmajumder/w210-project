  "<p>Only a scant knowledge of economics is necessary to realise that in the nature of things a boom must eventually go bust. Football, however, appears set on defying economic law for some time yet. </p> <p>As the new season begins there is no obvious sign that the game in England, with all its shortcomings, is about to loosen its bulldog grip on either the public's affection or the public's purse. When people queue up outside the Manchester United megastore at midnight in order to be the first to buy the latest design in shirts at \u00a348 for adults and \u00a338 for children, it is hard to argue that the game is heading for the rocks. </p> <p>Certainly the television companies do not share this view, scrambling over one another to pour more millions into club coffers under the latest agreement while said millions are being mortgaged by boardrooms to pay the fees and salaries of costly new signings. </p> <p>Much of the football may be mundane but financially the game, in general terms, has never had it so good. As well as the latest strike at the TV goldmine, clubs stand to earn extra windfalls through sponsorship and kit deals. And while their supporters may complain about increased admission prices, they have yet to stay away in significant numbers. Miss a match and withdrawal symptoms soon set in. </p> <p>With a captive and captivated audience, football, it seems, cannot lose. The unknown potential of pay-per-view has yet to be exploited to a serious degree but there is a proliferation of dot-commery to give fans a quick fix. A fully fledged European league is imminent and more new stadiums are planned, with Arsenal set to rebuild barely a mile down the road from Highbury. </p> <p>Given such an optimistic background, dissenters are apt to be given the sort of bemused glance accorded to those mournful figures who used to parade outside football grounds advising customers to prepare to meet their doom. </p> <p>At regular intervals financial experts warn that football is dancing on thin ice with heated skates. Yet the waltz continues, with an ever-higher proportion of club turnovers being spent on players' salaries as managers strive to keep their jobs while directors juggle to keep supporters and the banks happy. </p> <p>Inflation is rife. Students of O-level economics are taught that inflation is the result of too much money chasing too few goods, and when Tottenham feel compelled to spend \u00a35m on a defender, Ben Thatcher, from a relegated team, Wimbledon, the point is surely proved. Everybody, however, seems happy with the way things are. </p> <p>Only two things, in the main, could upset this sanguine state of affairs. One is a recession of sufficient severity to curtail the public's spending power and leave football with a lot of replica shirts on its hands, but there is no sign of this yet. </p> <p>The other is a stage at which BSkyB felt its coverage had reached such a point of saturation that no useful purpose would be served by forever upping the ante. If that happened a shudder would run through the game's balance sheets, but the process of soaking the viewers has barely begun. </p> <p>Fans will always moan about a losing team and few have ever had a good word to say about referees, but in general it seems that football can do no wrong. The England team may have failed in a major tournament under a coach whose only credentials appear to have been his popularity and ability to get on with the media, but England teams have flopped before without diminishing people's enthusiasm for a flawed but invigorating domestic game. </p> <p>The proliferation of foreign players, some outstanding, most merely competent, makes it easier for supporters to dissociate themselves from the mediocrity of the national team. Why worry about who will follow Alan Shearer in the England attack when your club has signed a talented Ukrainian, Sergei Rebrov, or a goalscoring Dutchman, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink? </p> <p>Fans are not daft. They know that technically the Premiership is not on a par with the leagues of Italy and Spain, but will insist that for action, incident and excitement it has no equals, an argument supported by the number of foreign countries who take the live TV coverage from English grounds. </p> <p>\"English football is at its best when our teams are playing each other,\" Ron Greenwood declared many years ago, and the domestic product continues to support this view. Terry Venables was also right when he said that the English game thrived on errors which became an embarrassment when repeated in international tournaments, a point well made by Kevin Keegan's team this summer. </p> <p>This is why, while Manchester United and Arsenal may be among the European clubs forever threatening to break away and form their own TV-orientated league, fans will take a great deal of persuading that such a competition could ever take precedence over the present scheme of things. In the longer term, domestic rivalries will always have more appeal than international rivalries. </p> <p>The Premiership remains a lead pencil with a gold top but few fans are complaining. And United will not stay top forever, even though it may take Sir Alex Ferguson's impending retirement to end their present domination. If he actually goes, that is.</p>",
  "On the desert sands of Jericho, not far from Sodom and Gomorrah, thousands of Israeli Jews are succumbing every night to a powerful temptation: legalised gambling. <p>The Oasis casino is a light pink lump that has pretensions of Atlantic City glitz, although it is across the road from a Palestinian refugee camp. Less than a year after it opened, the roulette wheels are spinning dizzily, and the twisting desert highway from Jerusalem is bumper-to-bumper on weekend nights.</p> <p>The Oasis is the first legal casino within easy drive of Israeli homes since the Jewish state was founded in 1948, and its attractions are proving irresistible. </p> <p>But the casino's popularity is surprising. Jericho is a taboo territory - controlled by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority - where many Israelis would not otherwise venture.</p> <p>A trip to the tables requires submitting to Palestinian refugees in khaki uniforms who demand the surrender of weapons, and take your pictures with a hidden camera. It also means handing over your money to a former enemy when you lose. </p> <p>But Israelis, who make up 95% of the casino's customers, evidently have no qualms about that, helping the casino to rack up estimated earnings of \u00a3700m a year. Much of that windfall is going to the Austrian firm that runs it, but the rest finds its way to the Palestinian Authority.</p> <p>Inside its pink confines, the casino - open 24-7 barring the Jewish Day of Atonement - is a place of fierce concentration. Blackjack players clutch two hands at a time, and people strain to get close to the tables. Piles of empty coffee cups are racked up by the roulette wheels, their owners lost to the game.</p> <p>Most of the players are middle-aged or elderly people, gambling with their pension money, and riding the free buses that run between the casino and 13 Israeli cities. The regulars also include Orthodox Jews, who use the hours between 3am and 5am, returning to Jerusalem in time for morning prayers.</p> <p>Seema Levy, a Jerusalem housewife, says she takes the 8pm bus here nearly every evening. Beginning by playing chaperone to a husband who is a compulsive gambler, she now takes an occasional spin on the $10 (\u00a37) roulette. \"I still control the money, and when we lose $200 then we get back on the bus.\"</p> <p>But many of the regulars here have no such minder, and Ms Levy has seen players lose small fortunes. A retired telephone linesman confesses that his losses for April came to more than $3,000, and a building contractor toted up his losses since the casino opened in September 1998 as more than $50,000.</p> <p>Such dismal accounts are confirmed by addiction counsellors in Israel. \"Since the casino opened, I have had one thousand calls from families who have lost everything - houses, money, furniture, cars,\" said Pnina Eldar, who runs gambling treatment centres in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. \"People who have never gambled before are now addicted. It's a terrible situation.\"</p> <p>For the Palestinians, whose economy is largely held hostage by Israeli controls, the takings at Jericho are sweet revenge. The Jericho gambling den has proved so lucrative that the casino is planning to expand to the West Bank city of Ramallah, less than half an hour from Tel Aviv once a new Israeli security road is completed.</p> <p>Officials in the authority have few qualms about relieving Israelis of their funds, and they can rest secure in the knowledge that none of it is coming from Palestinians. By order of the Palestinian Authority, none may enter the casino, partly to appease Islamist clerics who had balked at the presence of a legal gambling den.</p> <p>For many Palestinians, the ban is simply good sense. \"Casinos are in the business of taking people's money away,\" said one employee.</p> <p>Neither apparently do Israelis have much compunction about handing their money over to a people still seen as the enemy by a significant minority of the population. \"In the beginning I used to be sensitive,\" Ms Levy said. \"I did not want to play and give money to Palestinians, but after a while, you just play, you don't worry where the money is going.\"</p> <p>That apparently has been a lifelong problem for Israelis. Ms Eldar estimates that 80% of Israelis over the age of 18 gamble; about 4% of the population are compulsive gamblers, a higher rate than in many western countries. She has also set up clinics for teenage gamblers, who play away their money at high school betting dens.</p> <p>Until the casino at Jericho opened, many Israelis such as Ms Levy were regular travellers to casinos in Turkey - all of which closed two years ago - and in Taba, on the Egyptian side of Israel's southern border. There are also thriving gambling operations on ships that call in at the port of Eilat.</p> <p>Ms Eldar fears the arrival of legal gambling so close to home will prove irresistible to Israelis, and complains that the government's social services department has failed to recognise the danger in the vice.</p> <p>But many at the Oasis would dismiss her as an alarmist. \"Anyone who has a brain knows how to play,\" said a housewife from Ramle, who was settling in for a long night to recover the $300 she lost at the roulette tables. \"You have to know there is a limit.\"</p>",
  "<p>Blade star <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Snipes,+Wesley\">Wesley Snipes</a> has lashed out at John Singleton's Shaft remake, claiming that he was initially offered the lead role but turned it down on moral grounds. Snipes described the resulting film as offensive, and an insult to black Americans.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/Film_Page/0,4061,334781,00.html\">Shaft</a> is an update of the 1971 blaxploitation classic starring Richard Rowndtree, which alongside films like Superfly and Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song is credited with helping black actors break into Hollywood. Singleton's remake, which stars <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Jackson,+Samuel+L.\">Samuel L Jackson</a> as the super-smooth crime-fighter, stormed straight to the top of the American box-office when it was released last month. But the film's success cut no ice with 38-year-old Snipes, who is a big fan of the original movie.</p> <p>\"There's only one Shaft - Richard Rowndtree,\" Snipes told reporters. \"And if you're going to do a remake there's only one person that can do that - Snipes, period.\" The actor claims that he was Universal studios' first choice for the role, but was put off after reading the script. \"I was offered the film and it was terrible, horrible. It was an insult not only to the African-American culture, but an insult to what the icon of Shaft was.\"</p> <p>Singleton's remake has been accused in some quarters of amounting to little more than a shrewd blaxploitation pastiche, aping the styles of the era but leaving out its radical political overtones. The film was described by J Hoberman in the Village Voice as \"basically a posture-fest fuelled by ethnic jive and racist invective.\"</p> <p>Snipes, who is currently working on <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0187738\">Blade 2</a>, is insistent that he has no complaints over Samuel L Jackson's performance. \"Sam is my man and we've been talking about this,\" he said. \"Sam knows I ain't dissing him, I'm dissing the movie.\"</p>",
  "Time was when you could savour your Phish Food in the certainty that, even if you were doing your cholesterol levels no favours, at least you were eating some of the healthiest ice-cream going. <p>But suddenly aspersions are being cast: a tub of Ben &amp; Jerry's is alleged to contain many times more dioxins than are permitted in industrial waste water pumped into San Francisco Bay. </p> <p>At a conference called Dioxins 2000, in Monterey, California, two scientists revealed that a serving of Vanilla Like It Oughta Be (known in the US as World's Best Vanilla), contains 80 picograms of dioxin - a tiny amount, but one which far exceeds the 0.14 picograms of dioxin that is the upper limit imposed by the US environmental protection agency (EPA) for a litre of effluent discharged from a petrol refinery in the Bay area. </p> <p>However, the aim of the report, authored by Steve Milloy and Michael Gough, is not to discredit the Vermont ice-cream maker, but to ridicule EPA limits on dioxins, a hot topic for environmentalists. </p> <p>Mr Milloy, who runs a website called Junkscience.com, which takes a pro-industry, anti-green stance, said: \"If dioxin is as dangerous as Ben &amp; Jerry's and Greenpeace think, then why do they continue to sell their ice-cream? It can't be unsafe or why would you want to expose your child to 74 times the level the EPA says is safe?\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Ben &amp; Jerry's, which is noted for its environmentally friendly policies, was unfazed by the attack. She said the company welcomed the dialogue about dioxins: \"They are saying these EPA-recommended accepted levels are ridiculous. We don't happen to agree.\" </p> <p>There are no recommended levels for dioxins in food, she added, because it would be impossible to test for them; they are in everything.</p>",
  "<p>The woman in the cagoule shuffles up to the table at which David Soul sits. \"Can I be rude and ask for your autograph?\" she says giddily. \"Is it rude?\" Soul retorts gruffly before taking her pen and the napkin she wants him to sign. \"What's your name?\" </p> <p>\"Carol.\" </p> <p>He signs a wild, looping signature on the crumpling tissue paper and Carol departs, ecstatic. Soul less so. This kind of thing happens a lot. </p> <p>\"And they use that line a lot, too - 'I'm being terribly rude.' I think, if you are being rude, why are you doing this at all?\" </p> <p>Soul has a story about performing at the old Apollo in Edinburgh. \"Every time I moved, the crowd screamed uncontrollably. I couldn't hear my music and neither could they. So I had to wait them out,\" he rails. \"Ten minutes I sat there wanting to play but unable to.\" Soul is clearly a man who tolerates more than enjoys his celebrity. </p> <p>For ever remembered as Hutch, partner to Starsky in the 70s cop series, and for his music career, including 1977's biggest-selling single, Don't Give Up on Us, Baby, Soul's celebrity comes from what he has done and not what he does now, a fact that you think may irk him. It has, after all, been nearly 20 years since he last jumped in the red-and-white-striped car and Don't Give Up on Us is rarely heard outside easy-listening clubs. </p> <p>\"That's not something that concerns me,\" he says firmly. \"You make a mistake if you seek celebrity, and there are a lot of people who do seek it, but celebrity is not a career. You have to have resiliency and understanding about what it's like dealing with adoration, but celebrity is like ice cream: it melts.\" </p> <p>For Soul, it would seem, it just defrosted. Since moving to London permanently in 1995 and concentrating on acting, directing and producing theatre, he has regained some notoriety after his absence from the public radar, bar the occasional blips in the 80s when rumours of domestic violence and alcohol problems surfaced. Since his one-man Charles Aznavour tribute in 1995, he has performed at Hampstead Theatre, at the Fridge in Brixton (where he also took to the stage with Starsky and Hutch co-star Antonio \"Huggy Bear\" Fargas in a series of concerts) and in the West End. He appeared most recently in Alan Ayckbourn's Comic Potential. </p> <p>Naturally, the next step was to bring a play to Edinburgh. The play is, aptly enough, Sam Shepard's Fool for Love. Set in an American motel room, it tells of a dysfunctional family and the lure of historical revisionism. \"It is a play that resonates for me. In my history I am an old stuntman who grew up in the midwest. Innocence and betrayal are locked, self-pity and finding new horizons are locked. I can't avoid those kind of things in my own life.\" </p> <p>Soul plays the Old Man opposite Stefan Dennis, the actor formerly known as Paul Robinson from Neighbours, and Soul's partner (and co-producer) Alexa Hamilton and his eldest son, Kristofer. </p> <p>Fool for Love is the first time Hamilton has been directed by Soul. \"It may be the only time in my entire life I get to tell her what to do so I'm going to enjoy it. Usually, I'm the one directed,\" he half-grimaces, half-laughs. Of his marital track record he admits, \"For Alexa, it's not easy being number five. Four marriages is sad. Divorce is death ...\" His voice tails off. \"Why wasn't I a friend first and then a husband?\" </p> <p>His mood of introspection deepens as he ruminates on the media that made him famous. \"TV killed real democracy,\" he announces, and he expresses an intense dislike of a lot of today's \"technological- produced music\". </p> <p>\"Nowadays all you need to do is sell 10,000 records and you can get in the charts, and by the time you sell 25,000 you've got a gold record,\" he laments. \"I had to sell records. You had to sell a fucking million records to get a gold record.\" </p> <p>He also worries for the future of theatre. \"We are not creating theatre audiences. If anything, they are slowly disappearing. We're not prepared to take the risks in the West End,\" he says fiercely. \"That's why we get remakes and revivals - because it's safe. And the blue-haired ladies that come to see those are getting fewer and fewer, while young people don't want to see theatre.\" </p> <p>This evangelical ire and me-versus-the-world philosophy has long been a companion to Soul. In 1960, he was president of the Young Democrats in Republican, redneck South Dakota, where he successfully campaigned for John Kennedy; he was arrested in the 80s for protesting after a Pittsburgh steelworks laid off 2,000 workers; and he canvassed for, and became friends with, Martin Bell when the journalist fought Neil Hamilton in Tatton at the 1997 general election. </p> <p>\"I have my regrets, like everybody. We can either choose to live and acknowledge them and move on with life or not. That doesn't mean you don't take responsibility or there aren't consequences. They are always there to remind you but at least you understand that. I hope I am an optimistic person. It's easy to be a conspiracy theorist - everything is shit and will go to shit. I can make a case for that and I have done. I have been a conspiracy theorist but now I'm not. Creating theatre is an optimistic act.\" </p> <p>David Soul's phone rings. It plays the William Tell Overture. \"The Lone Ranger,\" he grins. </p> <p>Fool for Love is at Our Dynamic Earth (0131-550 7800) till August 28.</p>",
  "The National Lottery's suggestion that \"it could be you\" has taken on an unfortunate double meaning for a group of factory workers in south Wales. <p>Only a week ago all 17 employees at the industrial fluids plant at Hirwaun, near Aberdare, were thanking their luck when the works syndicate scooped a \u00a34.4m lottery jackpot, yielding them \u00a3260,000 apiece. </p> <p>Now they are not so sure. The decision of two key workers to retire and enjoy their winnings has persuaded the company to shut the plant. </p> <p>Directors of the parent company, Houghton, based in Manchester, said yesterday that they had \"no choice\" other than to close the 20-year-old factory. </p> <p>Production will be switched from Hirwaun to Manchester, and although some of the south Wales workers are being offered relocation two are being made redundant. </p> <p>The company's chairman, Paul Miller, confirmed that the closure decision stemmed from the lottery windfall. \"We interviewed each of the staff about their intentions and decided we could not carry on. Two key members of staff wanted to hand in their notice. We cannot just take workers off the street to replace them - it is a highly skilled operation. We have to make the right decision for the future of the company as a whole and our customers.\" </p> <p>The 100-year-old company employs more than 350 people at its Manchester, Middlesbrough and south Wales operations. </p> <p>Members of the Hirwaun syndicate, two of whom are about to get married, put their celebrations on ice after the lottery win to make sure they met a vital order on time. Now their win is tinged with sadness. </p> <p>\"This has really wiped the smile off our faces,\" said one syndicate member on learning of the intention to shut down the factory. </p> <p>\"It is a nice amount of money but not enough for most of us to pack in work altogether. </p> <p>\"Everyone is very sad about the decision. We were happy with our lottery win but now I'm not so sure. </p> <p>\"The sad thing is that we were a small and friendly workforce. Winning the jackpot has split us up for good.\"</p>",
  "<p>Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at their highest for 20m years, two British scientists reveal today. </p> <p>The two men analysed the shells of tiny ocean creatures to build up a fossil record of the chemistry of the atmosphere for the past 60m years. Their discovery will add to pressure on governments to implement international agreements to reduce the greenhouse gases that fuel global warming. The news comes hard on a report from the University of Colorado that Arctic temperatures are at their warmest for at least 400 years. </p> <p>Paul Pearson of the University of Bristol and Martin Palmer of Imperial College, London, report in Nature today that they used the evidence of plankton shells drilled from the seabed to estimate the acidity of the sea water over a span of time back almost to the era of the dinosaurs. Carbon dioxide dissolves in water to form a weak carbonic acid. They reasoned that the tissue of floating organisms would reflect the carbon dioxide levels of the world around them - and then hold that record locked in the fossilised shells. </p> <p>Other studies of more recent records have confirmed a picture of a rapid warming in the past two decades. Winter is in retreat. The growing season in Europe is 11 days longer than it was 35 years ago. Sea levels have crept higher throughout the century. Six of the 10 warmest years ever recorded occurred in the 1990s; the other four all happened in the late 1980s. The Arctic ice cover is in retreat, shrinking by an area the size of the Netherlands every year. It is also thinning, from more than three metres thick to less than two metres in 30 years. </p> <p>Now a team from Boulder, Colorado, reports this week in the Dutch journal Climate Change that wherever it looked - at Arctic ice cores, lake sediments or plant growth in the permafrost - it saw confirmation that the Arctic had warmed by 6C in the past 30 years. </p> <p>But in the tropics, humans have felt the impact more cruelly. Researchers long ago predicted more storms, droughts and floods as a consequence of a warmer world, and both the economic costs, and the numbers of victims of climate-related disasters, have increased in the past decade. </p> <p>Paul Epstein, of the Harvard medical school in the US, warns in this month's Scientific American that global warming must also mean an increase in water-borne and insect-borne diseases to add to the threat. </p> <p>But until now researchers have had no clear idea of the long term pattern of the planet's atmosphere. Dr Pearson said: \"Our observations put the modern greenhouse effect into a long term perspective.\" </p> <p>For much of the past 20m years, the planet has been quite cool. An Australian team reports in Nature today that at the height of the last ice age, 21,000 years ago, sea levels were 135 metres lower than today, and the continents were covered by an extra 52m cubic kilometres of ice. </p> <p>But carbon dioxide levels are rising swiftly because of fossil fuel burning and the clearing of the planet's forests, which in past aeons have taken carbon from the air and stored it, first as wood and then as coal. By 2100 the carbon dioxide levels will increase to match those last seen in the Eocene, 50m years ago. In those days, much of Europe was flooded, there were no ice caps, London was a steaming mangrove swamp and the average temperature of southern England was 25C. Today, the average temperature is 10C. </p> <p>Professor Palmer said: \"This does not necessarily mean we will recreate Eocene-type conditions. There are still too many unknowns involved in climate prediction. But the sweltering ice- free world of the Eocene does warn us of what might happen if a runaway greenhouse effect sets in.\" </p> <p><strong>Useful links:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/cegc/\">Union of Concerned Scientists</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.unfccc.de/\">UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/\">University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit</a></p>",
  "<p>Well, what went wrong? It is only 14 months since Britain's internet boom commenced, yet analysts are already chanting its obituary against the descant of high-flying startups hitting the decks. </p> <p>Companies such as <a href=\"http://www.Netimperative.com\" target=\"_new\"> Netimperative</a>, <a href=\"http://www.Boo.com/\" target=\"_new\">Boo.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.clickmango.com \" target=\"_newe\">Clickmango</a> ran into trouble despite having established quite well known brand names. For many years Britain's inability to nurture a strong venture capital industry was regarded as a serious structural weakness. Now it seems to have gone from boom to bust in a year. </p> <p>Or has it? The collapse of funding is really confined to the business-to-consumer (B2C) start-ups. A year ago venture capitalists were giving out-of-college entrepreneurs money even before they could get their backpacks off. Now, persuading a venture capitalist to fund a B2C proposition is like selling an ice cream in the Sahara. It melts into nothing while you are talking. </p> <p>But this doesn't mean that venture capital is dead. As Vic Morris of Atlas Venture points out, there is still plenty of venture capital around - but the smart money is now going into infrastructure, software and mobile telephony. VCs are still lending to retailing start-ups but just being much more choosy and concentrating on proven management skills rather than bright ideas. </p> <p>The surprising thing about the fall of the dot.coms is that anyone should be surprised. They are all small companies: and small companies have a very high mortality rate. Half of all new companies fail within five years, according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet. That's just the normal rate of creative destruction that makes capitalism tick. With dot.com companies you would expect the failure rate to be higher because of the youth and inexperience of the main players and the uncertainties of the new world of the internet. The difference is this - if they had been normal small companies, their successes would never have been exposed to the relentless daily spotlight of national publicity. </p> <p>Consider: Clickmango, with Joanna Lumley as its icon, had a turnover of only \u00a32,000 a week - which scales up to annual sales of \u00a3104,000. The local village shop could do better than that. </p> <p>At first \"Old Economy\" companies feared they might be swept away by the internet revolution they had been so slow to foresee. Then they realised they had two invaluable assets that the dot.coms had not thought much about. Brand identity and a proven delivery system. </p> <p>At this point the writing was on the wall for many of the less original start-ups that were merely selling old economy goods in an electronic way. They soon found out that the economic benefits arising from not having to build a national network of shops was offset by other factors. Like the vast amount of money needed first to make the public aware they existed and, second, to deliver the goods in a reliable way. </p> <p>It is salutary to see that <a href=\"http://www.Lastminute.com\" target=\"_new\">Lastminute.com</a>, the best known of all the UK start-ups which benefited from huge free publicity, spent almost \u00a36m on sales and marketing in the latest quarter. This was almost six times the value of its sales during the same period. This may turn out to be justified once the company has established a strong international presence - but it is not something that other less well endowed start-ups can easily replicate. Interestingly, Lastminute this week spent \u00a359m buying the French travel company D\u00e9griftour which pre-dates the world wide web. A rare case of a new economy company buying an old economy company to bolster its survival chances. </p> <p>So who gained from the frenetic first year of activity? The answer is everyone. It has been a traumatic wake-up call for commerce and industry. Companies know they must embrace the internet or be devoured by it. From the small corner shops now able to sell their specialist wares on a world market to the huge trillion dollar intranets being constructed by the world's biggest car companies to rationalise component purchases, the message is the same: the internet will transform the way we buy, sell and produce goods and services. </p> <p>The clear winner has been the consumer who has benefited from the deflationary impact of globalisation and the internet. This has brought remorseless downward pressure on prices because of the global availability of suppliers and the consumer's ability to surf the net for cheaper offerings of the same product. </p> <p>We have now entered the second stage of the internet revolution - a financial bloodbath which only the fittest will survive. The worst of the new start-ups will simply collapse and never be seen again. Some will struggle on without making any money while others will be snapped up at bargain basement prices by predators who will adapt the assets for new purposes. </p> <p>Hopefully, the second stage of the revolution, will also generate new business ideas based on the unlimited potential of the internet rather than merely gluing an internet selling solution to an Old Economy business. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the venture capital money is migrating to business-to-business ideas, to infrastructure building where less competition means there is more money to be made and to the huge, but as yet uncharted, possibilities of commerce through the ubiquitous mobile phone and interactive television. The revolution has barely begun.</p>"
