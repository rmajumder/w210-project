  "<p>Specialist shops are worth a detour for interesting presents and self-indulgence, but they also reveal much about the quirky, living culture of a city. </p> <p>You have no idea of the depth and breadth of goods on offer until you enter the door of the expert. Many have been run by the same family for generations and the objects on show - some too precious to sell - make them like museums run by commercial curators. Such shops are usually worth visiting even if you buy nothing at all. Unlike the anonymous morgues of modern retail chains, they are often alive with incident and interesting characters. </p> <p>And by shopping at the specialist, you are keeping alive a tradition of good service and expertise that that survives in the face of mass-production. </p> <p><strong> Tamburini </strong></p> <p> <strong> Location: </strong> in the city centre - Via Caprarie 1, 40124 Bolgona. <br> <strong> Tel: </strong> (00 39) 051 234726. <br> <strong> Fax: </strong> (00 39) 051 232226. <br> <strong> Web: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.tamburini.com\">www.tamburini.com</a> <br><strong> Open: </strong> Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday 9am-7pm, Tuesday and Thursday 9am-2.30pm. <br><strong> Specialities: </strong> Regional food, particularly pasta, cured meats and cheese. <br><strong> Sample prices: </strong> 12,000 lire (\u00a34) for a bottle of Tamburini's prosecco; 16,000 lire (\u00a35.30) for 500g gnocchi with porcini; 40,000 lire (\u00a313.50) for a 2kg mortadella. </p> <p>Tamburini's is a spectacular deli in a city famous for its sensuous appetite. The smell of the wood-fired rotisserie pulls you off the street into a long, marble-floored room, where hundreds of dishes are prepared daily. One counter is a white expanse of cheese, another a wall of cured meats. You can take the food away for picnics and presents, or eat at the self-service restaurant. </p> <p><strong> Ljunggrens Pappershandel </strong></p> <p> <strong> Location:</strong> In the Old Town, near the Royal Palace - K\u00f6pmangatan 3, Gamla Stan, Stockholm. <br> <strong> Tel:</strong> (00 46) 8 676 0383. <br> <strong> Fax:</strong> (00 46) 8 103377. <br> <strong> Open: </strong> Tuesday to Friday 11am-6pm, Saturday 11am-3pm (closed on Saturdays in July and August). <br> <strong> Specialities:</strong> papers from all over the world; hand-made books; sealing wax. <br> <strong> Sample prices: </strong> 12 kronor (\u00a31) for a sheet of Swedish hand-made paper; 350 kronor (\u00a327) for a hand-made book. </p> <p>The interior is as exquisite as a landscape under snow, with sheets of white paper hanging from the walls and a calm, slightly muffled atmosphere: a peace of paper. </p> <p>The finest Japanese hand-made sheets weigh in at 7.5g per square metre, (compared with 80g for photocopier paper). Others are strong and flexible enough to use as curtains. </p> <p>Italian papers are another speciality. A man who restores pre-1500 books for the Vatican once told the owner she had the best selection of papers he had ever seen. </p> <p><strong> Die Imaginare Manufaktur </strong></p> <p> <strong> Location:</strong> in Kreutzberg, Kottbusser Tor U-bahn 1,12 and 15 - Oranienstrasse 26, D-01999 Berlin. <br> <strong> Tel:</strong> (00 49) 30 25 88 66 14. <br> <strong> Fax: </strong> (00 49) 30 25886615. <br> <strong> Web: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.blindenanstalt.de\">www.blindenanstalt.de</a> <br><strong> Open: </strong> Monday to Thursday 9am-4.45pm, Friday 9am-3.45pm. <br> <strong> Specialities:</strong> contemporary and traditional brushes. <br> <strong> Sample prices: </strong> DM44.5 (\u00a315) for a set of four brush egg-cups; DM120 (\u00a340) for a bristly fruit bowl. </p> <p>This shop is run by the Institute for Blind People in Berlin, which has had a workshop making traditional brushes, matting and wickerwork for nearly 100 years. In the late 1990s, business was slow and a design company across the road offered to help. </p> <p>After studying the methods of the workshop, it came up with new uses for traditional brushes, joining bottle brushes together to make a bristly fruit bowl and turning circular scrubbers into egg-cups. </p> <p>In just nine months, business trebled, and the products are now sold all over the world. Some are stocked in London by Babylon in the Fulham Road (020-7376 7255). </p> <p><strong> Il Gelato di San Crispino </strong></p> <p> <strong> Location:</strong> near the Trevi fountain and Barberini Metro - Via Panetteria,42, Rome (the original shop is at Via Acaia, 56-56a, San Giovanni). <br> <strong> Tel:</strong> (00 39 06) 6793924. <br> <strong> Open:</strong> noon-12.30am.

The sweet shock of the lemon sorbet comes from Amalfi lemons and the richly boozy zabaione is flavoured with 20-year-old marsala. Fruits are only sold in season, with the late summer red currants, raspberries and peaches giving way to pear, pomegranate and a fragrant grape sorbet. Anything unsold at the end of the day is thrown away: they start afresh each morning. </p> <p><strong> Deyrolle </strong></p> <p> <strong> Location: </strong> near metro Rue du Bac - 46, rue Du Bac, 75007 Paris. <br> <strong> Tel:</strong> (00 33 1) 42 22 30 07. <strong> Fax:</strong> (00 33 1) 42 22 32 02. <br> <strong> Open: </strong> Monday-Saturday 10am-6.45pm. <br> <strong> Specialities:</strong> taxidermy, natural history, geology. <br> <strong> Sample prices: </strong> Ffr2,900 (\u00a3287) to hire a stuffed zebra for two days; Ffr850 (\u00a384) to buy a stuffed rat. </p> <p>Deyrolle is full of life caught in freeze-frame. A cat naps curled up in a pram; a zebra prances; a dog looks at you around a display case, alert and ready to bark at the intruder. </p> <p>You can spend hours wandering over the creaky parquet looking at the animals and going through drawers stuffed with surprises such as a bunch of eyes on wires staring up like surreal flowers. </p> <p>Small children pat the animals; dogs growl at them. Some older customers have asked if they themselves can be stuffed. Deyrolle declines, but can there be a higher compliment to the taxidermist's art? </p> <p><strong> Au Grand Rasoir </strong></p> <p> <strong> Location: </strong> near the Grand Place and Gare Centrale - 7, rue de l'H\u00f4pital, 1000 Brussels. <br> <strong> Tel/fax: </strong> (00 32 2) 512 49 62. <br> <strong> Open:</strong> Monday to Saturday 9.30am-6.30pm. <br> <strong> Specialities: </strong> knives, razors, scissors; badger-hair shaving brushes. <br> <strong> Sample prices:</strong> kitchen knives from Bfr300 (\u00a34.80); Bfr1,250 (\u00a320) for a mushroom cutting knife and brush; Bfr2,000-11,000 (\u00a332-\u00a3177) for a badger-hair shaving brush. </p> <p>There are 2,500 blades on display, from dog-paw trimmers to wallpaper scissors to sea-urchin crackers. </p> <p>The owner, Monsieur Cielen learned his trade from his grandparents and has travelled around factories and workshops from the age of six.

Flights of steps lead nowhere; angels watch over you; doors are stacked like packs of cards; an enormous circus awning, a vaudeville white elephant, awaits a home. </p> <p>In the 1980s, much of it went for export, but now there has been a resurgence of interest in neo-gothic furnishings. Confession boxes make good telephone booths or showers, and hi-tech kitchens can be hidden behind high-church fittings, with a cookbook open like the bible on a brass stand and holiday snaps slid into a hymn board. </p> <p><strong> Antigua Casa Crespo </strong></p> <p> <strong> Location: </strong> Bilbao metro - Calle del Divino Pastor, 29, 28004 Madrid. <br> <strong> Open:</strong> Monday to Friday. 10am-1.30pm, 4.30pm-8pm. <br> <strong> Tel:</strong> (00 34 91) 521 56 54. <br> <strong> Speciality:</strong> espadrilles. <br> <strong> Sample prices:</strong> 625 pesetas (\u00a32.50) for a pair of espadrilles; 1,000 pesetas (\u00a34) for a natural fibre basket. </p> <p>In this quiet, family-run shop, there are woven bags, coils of rope and brushes made from natural plant fibres, but mostly they just sell espadrilles in 30 colours and 15 styles. Stripes of colour run along the shelves to show the fabrics on offer, from bright orange, turquoise and bubblegum pink to subtler shades such as soft cherry red and mushroom. </p> <p>The shoes are made in the north central Rioja region in workshops where some of the sewers have worked for decades. </p> <p><strong> Bric-a-Brac &amp; Bric-a-Brac 2 </strong></p> <p> <strong> Location: </strong> Near the Old Town square - Tynska 7, Prague. <br> <strong> Tel:</strong> Bric-a-Brac 1: (00 42 0) 2 232 6484. <br> <strong> Open: </strong> Monday to Sunday 10am-6pm. <br> <strong> Specialities: </strong> beautiful small objects, art deco. <br> <strong> Sample prices: </strong> 900 Koruna (\u00a316) for a 1940s fountain pen; 60 Koruna (\u00a310) for a 1950s wooden toy drummer on wheels. </p> <p>Well-made objects bought in the good times were kept through the bad.

These two shops stand out among the many of their kind in Prague because of the owners' genuine love of the articles. </p> <p>Bric a Brac 1 is a dim, exciting cave which is the haunt of collectors of small objects such as thimbles, scissors and sets of scales. Bric-a-Brac 2 is a large, light shop, a haven for art deco and the styles of other decades that is arranged like an enormous, intricate still life: a row of evening bags hanging on a line like bobbing apples, pearls on seashells, elegant irons, wooden toy boats, perfume sprayers, cameras, Mosser crystal, little boxes, opera records. </p> <p><strong> PCJ Hajenius </strong></p> <p> <strong> Location:</strong> near the Dam - Rokin 92-96, 1012 KZ Amsterdam. <br> <strong> Open: </strong> Monday noon-6pm, Tuesday to Saturday 9.30am-6pm, except Thursday 9.30am -9pm, Sunday noon- 5pm. <br> <strong> Tel: </strong> (00 31) 20 623 74 94. <br> <strong> Fax: </strong> (00 31) 20 6387221. <br><strong> Web: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.hajenius.com\">www.hajenius.com</a> <br><strong> Specialities:</strong> cigars and pipes. <br> <strong> Sample prices: </strong> 15-78 guilders (\u00a34.50-\u00a323) for a Cuban cigar; 60-2,000 guilders (\u00a318-\u00a3593) for a pipe. </p> <p>Like the rest of Amsterdam, this is a shop at ease with pleasure.

  "<p>When Catharine Hartley was training to pull her sledge to the South Pole, she would harness herself to an old tractor tyre and drag it up Cross Dyke, a ridge on the South Downs with exhilarating views across the meandering channels and inlets of Chichester Harbour. </p> <p>But when she returned from her exhausting 61-day trip, the walk she took to reflect on the experience and think about the future was more private and secluded: down a lane from her home village of Chidham, and across fields to a jetty beside one of those inlets. </p> <p>She'd been there on the eve of her departure as well, and dozens of other times when she wanted to escape and take stock of her life: as a child she also took friends down there to go mudlarking at low tide, returning to be hosed down on the lawn by a furious mother. </p> <p>\"The place is very special for me, like an old friend, because it's got a lot of emotional history,\" she says. \"I'd go there if I was feeling miserable or wanted to contemplate what to do about problems with boyfriends or whatever. For 30 years I've been doing there to think about things.\" </p> <p>The jetty has a fine view across the channel to Bosham, one of southern England's most beautiful villages, with its Saxon church and rich history: it was here that King Canute is said to have ordered the tide to recede, and the village also features on the Bayeux Tapestry. </p> <p>Hartley once waded through the mud across to Bosham at low tide, but usually her walk continues a cou ple of miles down the coast to the hamlet of Cobnor, where she used to keep a small dinghy for sailing around the islands and sandbars, picnicing and sunbathing. </p> <p>The path goes past fields of potatoes and cabbages and barley, with seabirds hanging on the wind and small boats riding or fighting the tides. </p> <p>\"It's incredibly peaceful, and it's wonderful when you've just come back from London or from travelling because it's familiar and safe and normal,\" she says. </p> <p>\"I would always go by myself, because I'd hate to take someone else who was bored by it or failed to appreciate it. It's something I don't want to share. I rarely meet other people, and when I do they tend to be other locals, so it's nice to stop and pass the time of day.\" </p> <p>But Chidham by itself would never be enough: Hartley, now a location man ager for BBC TV, used to tour the country with theatre groups and would walk by herself for hours in the moors and dales. She now goes rock climbing too, but says she never takes risks. </p> <p>She suffered from being bad at sport at school and has loathed any competitive activity ever since. Instead she's discovered that she likes confronting hardship: \"I really enjoy going on walks when it's filthy, miserable weather , when its pouring with rain and you're struggling against the wind. </p> <p>\"I've been on some horren dous walks in Scotland, but the feeling at the end is absolutely fantastic, when you get back and sit by the fire. </p> <p>\"I think I must enjoy a struggle, but I find it so hard to explain why. Perhaps it is because I love putting my body through something difficult and gruelling, and testing my mental strength as well. </p> <p>\"I think it makes me feel alive. For many years I just plodded along and I hardly even felt awake, but the kind of thing I'm talking about really opens up your senses and makes you feel you really exist.\"</p> <p><strong>Antarctic walker</strong></p> <p>Catherine Hartley reached her mid-twenties feeling that her life was going nowhere. \"I felt I had failed educationally and was just bumbling along, but I desperately wanted to succeed at something without knowing what it was,\" she says. </p> <p>\"So I gave up work and went travelling for two years to sort myself out, and I discovered that I had this phenomenal thirst for adventure. I just yearned to go where no one else went, and when I got back I realised this was where I'd make my mark.\"</p> <p>Then she started thinking and reading about the polar regions and discovered that none of the half-dozen women who'd walked to the South Pole were British. \"I decided that one day, the first British woman would be me,\" she says.</p> <p>After years of planning, training and struggling to raise \u00a330,000, she finally shared the achievement in January this year with Fiona Thornewill from Nottinghamshire. They travelled in a group which included Fiona's husband Mike, four other men and two experienced polar guides. Shortly afterwards, five other British women completed the journey without guides.</p> <p>\"The journey was hideous, an enormous struggle, going through one pain barrier after another,\" says Hartley. \"I was the weakest of the group so I had to deal with the demoralisation of trying to keep up, and struggling every inch of the way.</p> <p>\"When I came back I said, never again. But after about three months I began to get itchy feet, and I'd possibly like to look at something else, but I don't know what. No British woman has walked the whole way to The North Pole yet, but that's much harder because it's not on land, so you have to go in winter when the ice is frozen hard.</p> <p>\"So it's colder and darker and there are huge pressure ridges in the ice and you have to haul your sledges over them, which needs an incredible amount of strength.</p> <p>\"But there are many other things you could do in other parts of the world as well.\"</p> <p><strong>The practicals </strong></p> <p>Nearest stations to Chidham are Bosham and Nutbourne: National Rail Enquiries 08457 484950.

  "<p>To take a break in Kiev is to savour what it must have been like to be a British tourist on the Continent in the days before air travel and cheap packages - you are as exotic to the city as it is to you. Foreign newspapers are few and far between, guidebooks are almost impossible to find, hotels thin on the ground. </p> <p>For all that, it is Europe. Your mobile works, there are cash machines, night clubs, and beer on tap. And it is possible to satisfy your yearning both for the flavour of the old Soviet Union - Lenin statues, Brezhnev-era design, headscarved babushkas driving clanky old trams - and for the gangsterish, hedonistic, sometimes intoxicating rush to capitalism that followed it. All this without the overwhelming pace and aggression of Moscow. </p> <p>Some will find Kiev's indifference to foreign tourists hard to take. It's not that the Ukrainians don't like tourists: it's just that they don't care whether you come or not. If the lack of facilities for independent travellers and the need for a visa doesn't put you off, Kiev offers rewards. Though now outside Russia, it is the birthplace of Orthodox Russia; founded as part of a Viking empire that stretched from the Dnieper to Greenland, it has survived Mongol invasion, Nazi occupation and Stalinist terror. </p> <p>The Kiev of steep cobbled streets, opera house, Tsarist-era university, churches and monasteries described in loving detail by Mikhail Bulgakov in his civil war novel The White Guard lives on alongside monuments of the Soviet era like the massive Constructivist dimensions of the curving main street, Kreshchatik, and the Republican Stadium, home of the city's football club. </p> <p>Kiev has a lesson for towns that have lost ancient monuments: if they don't exist, rebuild them. Demolished under Stalin's anti-religious campaign in the 1930s, St Michael's cathedral, one of the jewels of Kievan ecclesiastical architecture since the 12th century, has been reconstructed from scratch in two years. It's only a copy, but it is a very beautiful copy, burnished with gold inside and out, rich with icons and wedding cake-icing blue and white paint. Its resurrection has restored one of the best urban vistas in eastern Europe - the broad paved prospect stretching from an ancient survivor of Stalin's wrath, St Sophia's cathedral, past the rearing equestrian monument to the 17th-century Ukrainian leader Bohdan Khmelnitsky, to St Michael's and then sharplydown through wooded heights to the great river Dnieper. </p> <p>A lot of what wealth Ukraine - a country of 50m - has is trickling into this city of 3m. It shows in the foreign cars outnumbering the Ladas on the streets, in the burgeoning caf\u00e9 culture for which Kiev had a reputation even in Soviet days, and in the restoration, or at least repainting, of the magnificent Silver Age apartment blocks of the Pechersk and Old Kiev districts, dating from the late 19th and early 20th century, when the city was a wealthy, thriving European metropolis. </p> <p>In the evenings of their short, hot summers, the young Ukrainians - beautiful people in cheap clothes - promenade like Italians under the huge shaggy chest nut trees that line the streets. There can be few cities as wooded as Kiev. In autumn, the leaves fall away, revealing the grubby walls of the prefab concrete apartment blocks. But while the leaves are there, some streets are like forests, with glimpses through the branches of art-nouveau balconies, or the massive stone shoulders of a sculpted, buttressing Atlas, or a pair of gold highheeled slingbacks crossed under a caf\u00e9 table. </p> <p><strong> What to see and do</strong><br> </p> <p> The best way to see central Kiev is to take a stroll. Start at Bessarabska Square (closest metro: Ploshcha Lva Tolstoho), site of the central covered market, where among the fat cherries, bright scarlet radishes and slabs of pork fat, you can pick up a 100g jar of black caviar for a few quid. Quality's a bit of a gamble, and don't buy too many, or you might have trouble with Customs on the way out, but one or two should be okay. </p> <p>Walk up Taras Shevchenko Boulevard - one of Kiev's few remaining Lenin statues stands here - and, with the blood-red pillars of Kiev university on your left, take a right on to Volodymyrska Street. Passing the opera house, after a couple of blocks you reach the Golden Gate, a reconstruction of one of the gates in the once-mighty city walls which proved all too vulnerable to the Mongols when they attacked in 1216. Keep going along Volodymyrska and you get to St Sophia's, with its landmark blue and white bell tower. This is one of the most ancient complexes of buildings in eastern Christendom: part of it dates back to the 11th century. </p> <p>Pressing on past the statue of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Volodymyrska eventually ends with the sight of Rastrelli's knobbly baroque masterpiece, St Andrew's church, at the top of Andriyivsky Uzviz. This cobbled street winds steeply downhill towards the old port district of Podil. It's a pleasant place to eat or drink outdoors in summer, with beer gardens, restaurants and craft shops and stalls selling kitschy - mainly Russian - souvenirs. Halfway down is the house where Bulgakov grew up: it is now the Mikhail Bulgakov museum. </p> <p>Don't leave without visiting Pechersk monastery, a collection of gold and white Orthodox churches and belltowers strewn among the trees on the steep heights above the Dnieper. </p> <p>Nearby is the city's most striking monument to the Soviet era - a gigantic titanium figure of a woman with a sword and a shield called Motherland, with a gloomy, powerful war museum underneath. </p> <p>If the weather's fine, get a glimpse of how the youth of Kiev passes its summer days on the sandy beaches of Hidropark, an island park in the middle of the river with its own metro station (same name). Sunbathe, drink beer, and admire the glorious view of the monasteries among the trees on the far bank. </p> <p><strong> Where to drink</strong><br> </p> <p> Bar wise, Ukrainian beers are now widely available -Obolon, once the local brew of choice, has been overtaken in popularity by Slavutych, from the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhya. </p> <p>Some of the trendier/ dodgier drinking dives are Blinadzh, (15a Mala Zhytomyrska); Oleksandria (6 Sahaydachnoho); Olzhin Dvir (7 Desyatinnyi); and, for a low-budget late-night dance experience, Vatra, (5 Metalistiv). More staid, ex-pat haunts include Eric's Bierstube (20 Chervonoarmiyska) and the inevitable Irish pub, O'Brien's (17a Mykhailivska). </p> <p><strong> Where to eat</strong><br> </p> <p> You can take your pick of Thai, Japanese, Mexican and French these days, but the search for authentic Ukrainian cooking is a nobler quest. Watch out for real borsch (the Ukrainians invented it), golubtsy (stuffed cabbage) and varenyki (Ukrainian ravioli), which come with sweet and savoury fillings. Chicken Kiev, or kotleta po-kiyivsky , is ubiquitous and bad - don't bother. </p> <p>At the upper end of the price scale is Tsarske Selo (42/1 Sichnevoho Povstan nya, tel: 290 3066); less good, and showing its age, but still worth it for the grand colonnaded setting, is Hostyniy Dvir (4 Kontraktova Ploshcha, tel: 416 6876). For cheap Ukrainian eats with a Caucasian edge, try Butterfly, behind the Besarabka market (5b Baseyna, tel: 244 9138). Pantagruel (tel: 228 8142), on the leafy square around the Golden Gate, serves a buffet of Ukrainian starters. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong><br> </p> <p> The clearest example of Kiev giving the tourist trade (and visiting business people) the finger has always been its indifference to the hotel mafia, which for years prevented the construction of new hotels and the renovation of old ones in order to keep prices high. This is now beginning to change. </p> <p>The cheapest hotels are on the city's grim left (east) bank; if you want to experience full-on Soviet housing estates, these are you. For a few dollars more, you can get closer to the centre on the right bank. But it is best to leave the booking to a travel agent - the agency can then sort out hotel and visa together. </p> <p>Unlovely but decent, reasonably-priced and central hotels include the Moskva (a Stalinist tower in the middle of town), the Kreshchatik, the Leningradsky, the Lybid and the Ukraina.</p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>British Airways (0345 222111) return economy fare Gatwick-Kiev is \u00a3310.16 if you stay a Saturday night. Britons need visas to visit Ukraine, which must be obtained in advance from the Ukrainian consulate at 78 Kensington Park Road, London W11 2PL (020-7243 8923), 3pm to 5pm, Monday to Friday. Unless you can get a personal invitation from a Ukrainian resident or organisation, you need to have a hotel booked in order to get a visa. Tourist visas cost \u00a325 and take two weeks to process. Any foreigner staying longer than three working days in Ukraine is supposed to register at the local police station. If you're staying at a hotel, they should register you automatically.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Martha Peake</strong></p> <p> Patrick McGrath </p> <p>340pp, Viking, \u00a312.99 <br> </p> <p> After the modern Gothic of Asylum, with its sexual obsession and psychiatric disorders, Patrick McGrath has plunged wholeheartedly into the 18th-century heyday of the genre. He offers in Martha Peake an accomplished masterclass, with every Gothic standby in place: the dark tale in a crumbling stately pile, winds howling outside; the antihero, heroic in his flaws; the coldly dangerous nobleman and his hunched, leering servant; the hand falling on the shoulder as the candle winks out and the swoon signalling horrors beyond words. </p> <p>McGrath has admitted that \"I deliberately feed the imagination by reading\", and historical pastiche is a readerly endeavour, uniting writer and audience through shared bookshelves and chummy nods at the correct conventions. The author is applauded for the linguistic equivalent of keeping digital watches out of shot, and purple passages read as literary authenticity. There is an especial danger of merely stylish exercise when reanimating a beast as easily identikit as the Gothic novel. But like the best of the genre, Martha Peake transcends its tics and types; they become, as in that other great Gothic pastiche, Northanger Abbey, cunning authorial tools to tempt reader and narrator alike. </p> <p>The story ranges from the smugglers' coves of 1730s Cornwall to the \"great squat toad\" of London and across the Atlantic to the tumult of the American Revolution. Throughout we hear the beat of drums and tramp of red-coated \"foot-soldiers of the Empire\", the tavern and coffee-shop grumbles of free-thinkers and free-traders alike. McGrath evokes the dream of that \"great good place\" America in old England, itching under corruption and poverty, with as much verve and precision as he paints the reality of emigration and uprising. </p> <p>Harry Peake, his splendidly Gothic fallen hero with \"the soul of a smuggler, and the tongue of a poet\", is known as \"Harry America\" for his huge rebellious spirit. Like Mr Rochester, he is too striking to be handsome; a keen reader of Milton, he shares Satan's self-imposed Hell. When his wife is killed and his back broken in a fire caused by his own drunken carelessness, he comes to London to expiate the guilt symbolised in that misshapen spine, displaying himself as a Gothic freak show. His very deformity is described in awed, admiring tones throughout, the hump \"like a fin... stretched taut upon its fragile outcrop of flaring bone\". </p> <p>From these depths \"the Cripplegate Monster\" exalts himself through ballads of such power that they can hush a rowdy tavern, until he sinks again through a fog of madness and bad gin into a lower Hell, raping and impregnating his own daughter. It is Martha who titles the book, and the story is as much hers as Harry's; from a pattern of filial devotion she becomes a damsel in the deepest distress, fleeing to Boston for refuge from her beloved father, and finally an emblem of the Revolution itself. </p> <p>These are the larger-than-life subjects of the novel; the tellers of the tale proclaim themselves as minor characters, but are decidedly more devious than that. \"As for me, I shall soon sink from sight and you will forget me altogether,\" promises Ambrose Tree, who is hearing the story from his dying uncle William, once assistant to the anatomist Lord Drogo, who took a professionally morbid interest in Harry's spine. However, William's opium haze and inconsistencies lead Ambrose first to expand on the \"bare bones\" of the story from his own \"ardent sympathetic understanding\" and then to wrest control of the narrative altogether.</p> <p> His self-medication against marsh fever only increases his fervour: heroising his subjects, he creates romantic reveries and absurd twists from a few epistolary scraps. Caught up in the logic of myth - and sweeping the reader along in its powerful tide - he accedes to the demands of \"poetic intuition\" and \"the weight of symbolic necessity\", passing on to Harry's child his mark of Cain, the terrible beauty of a misshapen back. </p> <p>By letting Ambrose's fevered imagination loose, McGrath demonstrates the mythologising process; it is this same \"symbolic necessity\" which elevates Martha into an emblem of rebellion at the cost of her complex and mundane humanity. Martha Peake 's great achievement is to encompass both the minute details and grand dreams of life, showing how out of the two we spin our stories. Ambrose develops from a captive audience into a manipulative storyteller, exercising \"the full powers of imagination - intuition - sympathy - and art\". As his tale bursts out of its narrative confines and into his own life, we see the dangerous powers of that seductive sliding scale. And the mind itself is revealed as the true Gothic element; it is the narrator's sensibilities and the reader's racing heart which conjure the key turning in the lock, the ghostly tread in the corridor.</p>"
