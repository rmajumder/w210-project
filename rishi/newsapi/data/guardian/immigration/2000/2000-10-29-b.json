  "<p>'Fabulous three-bed apartment. Amazing location, within spitting distance of Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament. Contemporary designer interiors. Must be seen.' </p> <p>Welcome to 51 Buckingham Gate and the secret world of the serviced apartment. The long limestone-floored hallway is gently lit, with doorways at regular intervals, leading into the living room - a huge space with tasteful art on the walls and oversized, comfy sofas in shades of cream, beige and aubergine. There is a master bedroom and two others with en suite bathrooms. The kitchen is fitted out in ultra-modern stainless steel. </p> <p>The apartment was designed by Noel Pierce, whose portfolio of work includes The Dorchester and the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong. He knows a thing or two about luxurious living. The bedlinen is made of the finest Egyptian cotton. The bathrooms are spacious, light and airy, with limestone floors and sleek Philippe Starck fittings - the sort you find in five-star hotels and fantasise about having in your own home. </p> <p>But this is not a showflat for some grand new loft-style development. You are not being asked for a fat deposit to buy the place. You are simply being asked for \u00a3630 to spend the night, with as many of your closest family and friends as you like. You can cook dinner. You can even throw a party and invite everyone to stay over. </p> <p>For an increasing number of travellers, hotels - even the poshest - are simply too much like, well, hotels. Some may be cosier than others. London's Covent Garden Hotel, for instance, is regularly a 'home from home' for stars, who love the fact that you can curl up with dinner in front of the fire in the upstairs lounge, topping up drinks all night from the honesty bar. Long-term guests have included Cate Blanchett, Ethan Hawke, Christina Ricci and Jessica Lange. </p> <p>But for guests who are after total privacy, or simply a place where the whole family can stay without running up huge bills on room service and breakfast buffets, the Covent Garden Hotel has another option: Durley House on Sloane Street. This is where Americans such as Blaine Trump regularly book in. She treats it not so much as a hotel, but as a pied-\u00e0-terre - with maid service, private gardens, breakfast, fluffy towels and tennis courts all included. The house is decorated by co-owner, Kit Kemp, in an elegant, modern English style. There is even a piano suite which comes complete with its own baby grand, a favourite of the conductor, Zubin Mehta, when he's in town. </p> <p>There are a surprising number of serviced apartments in London, ranging from the break-the-bank deluxe, to the basic and affordable. All are designed to have all the comforts of home - and add a maid, room service, and, in the case of 51 Buckingham Gate, your own butler if required. </p> <p>Roy McKenzie set up in business last year, with londonservicedapartments.co.uk. He acts as an online agent, pairing up clients with their dream home - however temporary. 'I still think it's a secret, but a growing one,' he says. His list ranges from Citadine in London's Covent Garden, where a basic studio apartment for two will set you back just \u00a3102 per night (less if you stay for a week or more), to the seriously chic No 5 Maddox Street in Mayfair. No 5 calls itself 'the hotel alternative' . It has just 12 apartments, and offers guests not only a fashionably bamboo-floored Zen pad to call their own for as long as they like, but the option of 24-hour room service, a chef who will cook in your kitchen for you and your guests, personal grocery shopping, a visit from the Jet Lag clinic, and Muji bikes to cycle around the city. Prices range from \u00a3215 to \u00a3550 per night. </p> <p>'The serviced apartment appeals to people at the economy end, who simply want to save on the cost of a hotel, to others who like the extra space and privacy, or the business traveller who wants to bring their family and lead a relatively normal life,' says McKenzie. He recently recommended 13 Half Moon Street in Mayfair for a film-production company in search of a traditional apartment with chandeliers. Not only is there a chandelier, there's enough room to swing on it too. And in the discreet world of the serviced apartment, no one would bat an eyelid. </p> <p> <strong> 51 Buckingham Gate</strong> <br> Luxury Suites and Apartments, London SW1 <a href=\"http://www.51-buckinghamgate.co.uk\">www.51-buckinghamgate.co.uk</a><br> phone 020 7769 7766.</p> <p> Set in a beautiful Edwardian courtyard, the apartments were built in 1901 and recently refurbished by Noel Pierce.

  "John O'Donoghue, the Irish Justice Minister, announced the launch last Tuesday of a \u00a34.5 million package designed to combat racism and heighten public awareness of the problem. <p>He told the Dail that the aim of the programme would be 'to help create a more inclusive society in Ireland, where racial prejudice is effectively outlawed and cultural diversity is regarded as a strength'. </p> <p>His words are likely to ring hollow with Aftab Ahmed, whose restaurant in Co Kildare was daubed recently with the words 'Leave or die'. A Pakistani married to an Irishwoman, Aftab opened his Tandoori Empire restaurant a year ago. </p> <p>At first business went well but then he began receiving hoax orders for take-away meals and recently events took a more ugly turn. He has to suffer drunks from a nearby public house urinating against the restaurant and shouting abuse at his customers. </p> <p>Racially motivated attacks have become all too common as Ireland tries to come to terms with its sharp rise in immigrants. Research conducted for the Irish Refugee Council shows that prejudice is also evident in encounters with the police and welfare officers. </p> <p>The anti-racism package has been welcomed as an attempt to initiate a campaign of education. But groups with experience of dealing with refugees say resources over a whole range of services are needed to enable immigrants to access an equal place in society. </p> <p>The number of people applying for asylum has increased sharply. It is running at 1,000 a month but only just over 500 a month are being processed. The backlog has now reached 13,000, compared with 9,000 less than a year ago. </p> <p>Immigration is a relatively new problem for Irish people who, in the past, were better known for their own efforts to seek a better life abroad. The recent success of the economy has made Ireland much more attractive to people fleeing poverty and persecution in their own countries. A stroll down any street in Dublin provides evidence that Ireland is well on the way to becoming a multi-racial society but the official reaction to this challenge has been one of fear and suspicion. </p> <p>The policy of dispersal - housing refugees away from large cities - has been ill-prepared. Local communities, often in small rural villages, have not been properly consulted and the resources needed for extra places in local schools and the provision of health services have been inadequate. </p> <p>A recent statement from the Irish Medical Organisation highlighted the difficulties experienced by doctors, particularly GPs, when refugees arrive in their surgeries speaking no English and unable to explain their previous medical history. Some are severely traumatised and need counselling as well as medical treatment. One doctor described trying to treat a patient by telephoning an interpreter in Dublin who translated what he said to the man, and vice versa. </p> <p>The reaction of local communities depends on the quality of leadership available, usually coming from the Catholic Church. Some groups provide language classes, legal advice and most importantly moral support. But there are problems that can only be solved by government. What most refugees want is to be allowed to work, but they are, for the most part, severely constrained from doing so while their applications are being processed. Trade unions and employers are united in pointing out that Ireland's successful economy is crying out for workers and that it would make sense to integrate immigrants into the workforce, rather than allow them to become a focus for popular resentment because they are perceived as 'sponging off the state.' </p> <p>There has been some progress. Two equality Bills, which ban discrimination in employment and the provision of services, are now law. This month a Dublin bus driver was convicted under the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act but this was the first conviction under a law which has been on the statute books for 11 years. </p> <p>This was an important ruling but it also demonstrates that tough, anti-discrimination laws are of no use unless there is a political will to enforce them.</p> <p><b>Useful Link</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/racism/\">Special report: race issues in the UK</a></p>",
  "<p>No matter how you dress it up, the bare facts are that we have to get a meal on the table for several people virtually every day of the year. Or, to be more accurate, several meals and snacks and treats and parties and, just now and again, we might like to have some friends round, too. No matter how much we like cooking and putting food out for others, it is still an unstoppable roller coaster of food, plates, pots and pans - and appetites. When one meal finishes we must start thinking about the next. And the next, and the next and the next. And there's more. We now need to consider the long-term implications of everything we put in our family's mouths; the likes and dislikes of everyone we are cooking for (a nightmare in itself); and cope with the nagging thought, 'Am I doing enough?' </p> <p>We alone know our own families, what they want, need, like and love. We know what they will wolf down uncomplainingly and when we may have to resort to what amounts to a softly-softly attempt at force-feeding. We alone know how far we are prepared to go to please them (answer: as far as we have to and further still). If I paint a somewhat bleak picture, I don't mean to: I mean only to be practical and to bring balance to the rose-tinted cookie-cutter images of family cooking given elsewhere. One thing I am sure of: every bone in my body believes that you should not try to force a child to eat something that he or she does not like. I say this having been one of those children who was forced to eat what my parents thought was good for me. </p> <p>Cooking for the family is more, much more, than simply getting a meal on the table for ourselves. It can and should be much more rewarding (though in truth it rarely feels like it). We can get an even bigger buzz out of it. Yet feeding others on a daily basis is different - we cannot skip supper or open a bottle of wine in lieu. We cannot (quite) put pasta on the table every night. </p> <p>I offer a few practical points here. You can find the cookie-cutter stuff elsewhere. </p> <p>\u0095 It will be easier for everyone if you get the whole family used to expecting the same food as soon as possible. I don't mean inflexibly so (we are surely past that now), but I do think there is much to be said for introducing what are considered 'adult' tastes into children's food as soon as possible. Why grate Cheddar to go on kids' pasta when they are going to have to get used to Parmesan sooner or later? Why introduce them to something that tastes skew-whiff when we are only going to have to put it right at some point anyway? </p> <p>\u0095 Most of us, I expect, don't even want to imagine a life without pasta - especially those of us with children. Whatever the xenophobic meat-'n'-two-veggists say, pasta is now our national dish. The family no longer unites over a joint of beef. It unites over a bowl of pasta. For the sake of all-round peace and harmony, I think it sensible to make the most of this. </p> <p>\u0095 If noses are ever turned up at one type of pasta, then try another shape. This may sound simplistic, but I know my heart used to sink when I was presented with macaroni, while penne (those short, nib-shaped sticks) has always filled me with delight. Noodles are a joy beyond belief (you can even make a silly noise while slurping them up from the bowl), yet they are possibly the messiest way there is to feed a family. </p> <p>\u0095 Nothing sticks to the floor quite like spaghetti with tomato sauce and Parmesan. </p> <p>\u0095 If the entire family likes pasta, you can bet that they will also like rice, potato-based meals and even couscous. All are equally beige and becalming. I mean this in the nicest possible way. All provide a bland and satiating base to which you can add other favourite ingredients and serve with the same bountiful earth-mother generosity as a giant bowl of pasta pesto. </p> <p>\u0095 In winter, a huge cauldron of bean and vegetable soup is something you can dip into and heat up in small quantities any time someone comes in cold and hungry and wanting something 'big' to eat. There is something of the feel-good factor about being the person with the overflowing ladle. </p> <p>\u0095 Introduce the family to your own spaghetti bolognaise before they start to get a taste for the ready-made stuff. </p> <p>\u0095 Get the kids cooking - or at least helping you out a bit - as soon as they show even the slightest interest in the kitchen. </p> <p>\u0095 No matter how much time it may save, don't serve up yesterday's leftovers when you come in from work. You will only feel wretched. Better to cook no more than you need of most things, except mash and boiled potatoes, which make great potato cakes and saut\u00e9ed potatoes - and are often better than they were the first time round. </p> <p>\u0095 Despite the depression that most leftovers bring to the table, I have never found a cold roast has the same effect. There is something quite cheering about finding enough cold meat left on a joint to make a sandwich or a salad. The trick is to bring it to room temperature rather than serve it straight from the fridge, and to add a fresh, pungent sauce and a groovy, knife-sharp salad. Try piquant sauce and some rocket leaves, and thinly shaved Manchego cheese. </p> <p>\u0095 It is worth remembering those dishes that do improve overnight, such as curry, stew and braised lamb. Cook them when you are in the mood and have the time, perhaps at the weekend, then refrigerate them for a night or two, bringing them out for a slow, thorough reheat one evening when you are feeling particularly exhausted. Forty-eight hours in the cool will do wonders for lamb braise and oxtail stew, for example. </p> <p>\u0095 No one can convince me that children do not like strong flavours. I know I did. Think of the tastes children enjoy: tomato ketchup, flavoured crisps, Marmite. They are all incredibly powerful flavours. How can we say olives are too strong for children when they will happily eat a bag of salt-and-vinegar crisps? Children who quail at the idea of garlic are often happy to tuck into your spaghetti bolognaise. In other words, the idea of garlic is often more frightening than the real thing. We just have to start them early enough - though we should probably abandon any attempts at getting them to eat capers. </p> <p>\u0095 Pudding is not essential and I don't think it is a habit we want to get into every day. Fruit is fine if it is ripe and luscious enough. And if you are very good you can have some ice cream, too. </p> <p>\u0095 I see no reason why we can't resort to a little bribery to get children to try something new. I mean, who hasn't occasionally found themselves trading off the odd forkful of something green and healthy for a spoonful of something more appealing? For the record, you get one small ball of Ben &amp; Jerry's for six forkfuls of spring greens. But no amount of bribery on earth would get me to like eggs when I was a child, and I still dislike them to this day. What I shall never know is whether I might have grown to like them had they not been forced down me by a well meaning but ultimately foolish parent. </p> <p>\u0095 I have always been a lone cook, finding 'help' in the kitchen more trouble than it's worth. OK, so I can't delegate, but I do rope people in to help peel the spuds, pull currants from their stalks and top-and-tail gooseberries. The kind of company I do like in the kitchen is someone who stands and gossips while I cook, and keeps the glasses topped up. But it is always nice to be asked if you need a hand. </p> <p><strong>An earthy, meal-in-a-bowl-type soup</strong></p> <p>Deep, dark, bass notes here. One of those swamp-like soups that gives much in the way of sustenance and warmth. I have offered this at big lunches for friends - a vast, bubbling cauldron of it, setting it down among the bread and cheese. Enough for 4 as a main course. </p> <p><strong> 2 small onions or 1 large one </strong><br> <strong> olive oil </strong><br> <strong> 3 or 4 cloves of garlic </strong><br> <strong> a good handful of diced unsmoked bacon or pancetta </strong><br> <strong> a small bunch of flat-leafed parsley </strong><br> <strong> a good 2 handfuls (250g) of green or brown lentils - maybe Puy or Castelluccio </strong><br> <strong> about a litre of stock or water - enough to cover the lentils completely </strong><br> <strong> 2 or 3 big handfuls of spinach </strong><br> <strong> a lemon </strong><br> <strong> a small bunch of mint - leaves only </strong></p> <p> Peel the onions and chop them quite finely, then let them cook over a moderate to low heat with a little olive oil, the peeled and sliced garlic and the diced bacon. You want all to be golden and fragrant. Chop the parsley and stir it in. </p> <p>Wash the lentils thoroughly and pick them over for little stones, then stir them into the onions and bacon. Pour over the stock or water and bring to the boil, skimming off any froth that appears on the surface. You can add a bay leaf or two if you like. Turn the heat down so that the lentils simmer merrily, then almost cover the pot with a lid and leave until they are tender but far from collapse - about 30 minutes, depending on the age of your lentils. </p> <p>Wash the spinach very thoroughly and tear it up a bit. While it is still wet and dripping, put it into a shallow pan over a high heat and shut the lid tightly - you want it to cook in its own steam. After a minute or so, it will be limp and bright emerald green. Lift it out, squeeze it dry (I do this by pressing it against the side of the pan with a draining spoon), then divide it between four warm bowls. </p> <p>Season the soup with salt, black pepper, lemon juice and the torn mint leaves, tasting it as you go. Ladle the hot soup on top of the spinach and serve with more lemon and mint for those who want it. </p> <p><strong>And more...</strong></p> <p> <strong> Haricot and tarragon soup </strong><br> Soak 250g of dried haricots overnight, then simmer them in unsalted water for 30 minutes. Drain and add to the onions and bacon. Continue as in the lentil soup above, but obviously without the lentils. Instead of mint, try tarragon leaves, but add them earlier, say 15 minutes or so before the soup is due to be ready. There is no need to offer more herbs at the table, but the lemon juice will still be welcome, as will some lovely crusty bread. </p> <p> <strong> Cannellini and chilli soup </strong><br> Soak and cook the beans as in the haricot and tarragon soup above but this time add a couple of seeded and chopped fresh red chillies to the onions and bacon. Serve with a slick of olive oil floating on top, plus the lemon and the mint. </p> <p> <strong> Lentil soup with celery and mushrooms </strong><br> Add a stalk or two of celery, finely diced, to the onions and garlic in the basic recipe above. Some button mushrooms, cut into quarters, can be added just before the lentils, so that they colour and sweeten. They will add even more earthy notes to the soup. You may need a little more lemon. </p> <p> <strong> Lentil and bok choi soup </strong><br> Spinach leaves are not the only greens. Use any of the Chinese leaves, such as bok choi, mustard greens or Chinese broccoli. Don't be tempted to try this with the tarragon mentioned in the haricot soup above. It won't sit comfortably. </p> <p> <strong> Other good things to add to the basic soup </strong> <br>Worcestershire sauce; mushroom ketchup (or mushroom seasoning as it is called nowadays); dark soy - stir it in at the end of cooking; a wine glass of Madeira (fabulous) about 15 minutes before the soup is due to be ready; crushed, dried chillies added with the onions and garlic; a few florets of broccoli instead of the spinach - too healthy-sounding, I know, but it is just brilliant if you have used the purple-sprouting sort. </p> <p><strong>A cheap spaghetti supper</strong></p> <p> It's not just that this is a cheap supper but that it is put together from things we tend to have knocking around anyway. Its practical, almost puritan background is a bonus. The point is that crisp bacon and breadcrumbs work brilliantly with the long strings of pasta. It makes a change to have pasta without a sauce. A few glugs of oil at the end are lubricant enough. You can safely use any of the thin pasta family here instead of spaghetti: tagliatelle, tagliarini, fettuccine or linguine. I have used the wide, floppy ribbons of pappardelle before now. They all work. Try to get a mixture of breadcrumb sizes, they are more interesting to eat. </p> <p>Per person:</p> <p><strong> 2 thickish slices of white bread - crusts removed </strong><br> <strong> a thick handful (about 125g) of spaghetti </strong><br> <strong> a thick slice of butter </strong><br> <strong> olive oil </strong><br> <strong> 2 good-sized rashers of streaky bacon </strong><br> <strong> a small bunch of parsley - leaves only, roughly chopped </strong></p> <p> Whiz the bread to rough crumbs in a food processor, or grate it by hand. It won't hurt at all (in fact it will be a bonus) if some of the crumbs are on the large side. Put a big pan of water on to boil, salt it generously and shove in the pasta. Let it cook for about 8 or 9 minutes, till it is tender but chewy. </p> <p>Meanwhile, melt the butter in a frying pan with a little olive oil to stop it burning. Cut the bacon into short pieces and fry it in the butter till its fat is golden and the kitchen smells wonderful. Scoop the bacon out with a slotted spoon into a large, warm serving bowl. Add a bit more butter and oil to the butter and bacon fat in the pan and tip in the breadcrumbs. Stir them from time to time in the sizzling butter till they have turned a rich gold. You need to keep an eye on them because they appear as if they are never going to brown, and then suddenly they're almost black. </p> <p>Drain the pasta and toss it with the hot crumbs and any of their butter, the bacon and the parsley, and a little olive oil to moisten and flavour. </p> <p><strong>And more:</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Spaghetti with bacon, breadcrumbs and garlic </strong> <br> Crush a clove of garlic per person into the butter before you fry the crumbs. </p> <p> <strong> And with chillies </strong> <br> Crushed, dried chillies seem to work better here than fresh. The quantity depends on your heat threshold but start with a fat pinch or two per person, stirring them in with the crumbs. </p> <p> <strong> And with lemon and thyme </strong> <br> Remove fine, young thyme leaves from their stalks and add them to the pan with the bacon. Squeeze the juice of half a lemon into the bowl as you toss everything together. </p> <p> <strong> Thin pasta with anchovies and parsley </strong> <br> Chop two or three anchovy fillets per person and cook them in a little olive oil over a low heat with a small handful of chopped parsley and a couple of cloves of finely chopped garlic. When the garlic is soft and pale gold - the anchovies will have almost melted - tip into a warm serving bowl, then continue with the crumbs as in the blueprint above. A pinch or two of dried crushed chillies, added with the anchovies, goes well here, too. </p> <p> <strong> With roast tomatoes and basil </strong> <br> Toss any of the thin pasta here with some roast tomatoes. I think it worth squashing them a little, and including their seedy juices. Basil leaves, torn to shreds, and some black pepper will produce a heady, sweet-sharp supper. There is nothing to stop you shaking some toasted crumbs over at the end if you fancy. </p> <p> <strong> And with butter and Parmesan </strong><br> For each person grate 60g Parmesan or pecorino. I know this will look like a lot but generosity is the only route to take here. Toss the hot pasta with a thick slice of your freshest butter (you really should open a new packet for this, as the sweetness of the butter is the whole point) and the grated cheese. The two will melt into a thin sauce that will lightly coat the spaghetti. Spoon over more cheese at the table - or on the floor or the sofa or in bed or wherever else you may be eating this. </p> <p><strong>Really juicy, spicy meatballs</strong></p> <p> Do you ever get an urge for food that is deeply savoury, citrus and fiery? I find the pork, lime leaves and chillies that are so much a part of Thai and Vietnamese cooking will usually do the trick. The citrus and chillies turn up in noodle soups, but sometimes the savour I want can only come from meat. These meatballs, which I often drop into a savoury chicken broth, may well be what you are after. </p> <p><strong> a handful of smoked bacon or pancetta </strong><br> <strong> 500g minced pork </strong><br> <strong> groundnut oil </strong></p> <p>For the seasoning: </p> <p><strong> 2 shallots or 4 small spring onions </strong><br> <strong> 3 or 4 small, hot, red chillies </strong><br> <strong> a small bunch of coriander </strong><br> <strong> 4 lime leaves or 2 thick stalks of lemon grass </strong><br> <strong> 3 or 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed </strong></p> <p> Chop the shallots or spring onions finely, then chop the chillies even finer, first removing the seeds if you don't like things too hot. Scrub the roots of the coriander and chop them and the leaves finely, discarding the stems. Roll the lime leaves up and shred them finely, then chop them; if you are using lemon grass, discard the coarse outer leaves, then chop the tender inside leaves very thinly. All this can be done in a food processor. </p> <p>Chop the bacon or pancetta and add it, with the seasoning above, to the minced pork. Mix in a good pinch of salt, then cover with clingfilm (otherwise it will taint everything in your fridge) and leave to rest and chill for half an hour or more. </p> <p>Shape the seasoned pork into small balls. The size is up to you. If you flatten them slightly you will get more of that delectable savoury crust when you fry them. I tend to start with a ball of mince the size of a walnut in its shell, then flatten it slightly. To cook them, you will need to warm a little oil in a heavy frying pan, then lay the meatballs in - without crowding them - and let them colour enticingly on both sides before turning the heat down a bit and letting them cook all the way through. You should find them done after four or five minutes. Test one by breaking it open: the centre should be juicy but not especially pink. </p> <p> <strong>And more...</strong></p> <p> <strong> A European version </strong><br> Perhaps you are after something savoury without the chilli rush. Make and cook the balls as above.</p> <p><strong> a handful of smoked bacon or pancetta </strong><br> <strong>500g minced pork </strong><br> <strong>groundnut oil </strong></p> <p>For the seasoning: </p> <p><strong>a couple of plump and juicy cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed </strong><br> <strong>fontina - or other easy-melting cheese such as Gruy\u00e8re, roughly diced </strong><br> <strong>the grated zest of 1 medium-sized unwaxed lemon </strong><br> <strong>a palmful of leaves of thyme, chopped </strong></p> <p> <strong>And more...</strong></p> <p> <strong> Meatballs in a hot, refreshing broth </strong><br> A hot, herbal, citrus-chilli supper. One of my favourite things to eat involves serving the Thai-inspired meatballs in a hot, herb-scented chicken broth. You will need some good chicken stock - about a large cupful per person, and I really think it should be home-made but I suppose bought stuff will do (sometimes it just has to). Bring it to the boil with a smashed stalk of lemon grass or a couple of lime leaves and a couple of chopped red chillies, then let it simmer for a few minutes while you fry the meatballs. Drop them into a deep soup bowl, strain over the fragrant, piping-hot stock, then stir in some chopped mint leaves and some basil or coriander. </p> <p> <strong> And in a mild, consoling one </strong><br> If you have made the Euro-version with cheese and thyme, you can still turn the meatballs into a substantial soup-supper by using the same chicken broth but flavoured with lots of chopped, vivid green parsley instead of the lemon grass and chillies. </p> <p> <strong>A sponge pudding with its own sauce</strong></p> <p> I believe passionately in the power of sweet, homely puddings to cure all manner of ills. Warm, nannying, becalming. Tucking into a dairy-rich hot pudding is, I am sure, the adult version of breastfeeding. To have some such pudding recipes to hand can prove endlessly useful, especially the good-natured ones like this, where a few grams either way matters less than is usual with baking. I am not sure you will want anything too sturdy to precede this, unless you are in the depths of winter. Enough for 6.</p> <p><strong> 100g butter </strong><br> <strong> 175g caster sugar </strong><br> <strong> 1 lemon </strong><br> <strong> 2 medium-sized oranges </strong><br> <strong> 4 eggs </strong><br> <strong> 40g plain flour </strong><br> <strong> 400ml milk </strong></p> <p> Cream the butter and sugar together until they are light and fluffy and the colour of finest double cream. It is easiest to do this is in a food mixer, though you could do it by hand if your butter is soft and you are feeling athletic. Set the oven at 180 C/Gas 4. </p> <p>Grate the zest from the lemon, making sure none of the bitter white pith comes with it, then cut the fruit in half and squeeze the juice. Do the same with the oranges. </p> <p>Separate the eggs and add the yolks to the creamed butter and sugar. The mixture will curdle but I wouldn't let it worry you. Now add the flour and milk alternately, the mixer on slow to medium, so you end up with a soft, cake-like batter. Stir in the orange and lemon zest and then the juice. </p> <p>Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks with an electric beater, then fold them carefully, so as not to knock out the air, into the batter. Scrape into a heatproof mixing bowl or souffl\u00e9 dish so that the mixture comes about halfway up the sides. Stand the basin in a roasting tin half-filled with hot water, then carefully transfer it to the oven. Bake for an hour or so, until the top is puffed and golden - press it with your finger to test; it should feel spongy - cool for five minutes before serving. </p> <p> <strong>And more...</strong></p> <p> <strong> A lemon pudding </strong><br> Drop the oranges in favour of another two medium-sized lemons. If they are particularly juicy you may only need one. </p> <p> <strong> A chocolate pudding </strong><br> Into a large bowl put 150g self-raising flour, 2 tablespoons cocoa powder, 200g light soft brown sugar, 100g roughly chopped fine, dark chocolate, 200ml milk, a large knob of butter, melted, and a beaten egg. Mix well. Pour into a buttered pudding basin. Mix together 75g dark soft brown sugar, 75g golden caster sugar and 100g cocoa powder and scatter it on top. Pour in 400ml of almost boiling water. Put the pudding in a roasting tin of hot water and bake for 35-40 minutes at 180 C/Gas 4. </p> <p> <strong> A chocolate hazelnut pudding </strong><br> Add 50g finely chopped hazelnuts to the ingredients above. </p> <p> <strong> To serve </strong><br> The tartness of the lemon and orange puddings and the obscene richness of the chocolate version are cooled by the addition of double cream. Serve it by the jugful. The idea is that it merges lusciously with the pudding's intense, integral sauce. * </p> <p>\u0095 Visit <a href=\"http://www.nigelslater.co.uk\">www.nigelslater.co.uk</a> - recipes are updated daily.</p>",
  "<p>Early last year I began training for one of the few polar challenges still to be achieved: an attempt to reach the North Pole solo and unsupported by the direct route from the Arctic coastline of North America. </p> <p>I estimated it would take 85 days. For safety I would carry 90 days' food. This alone would weigh more than 230lb, with fuel to melt ice to rehydrate it coming to another 60lb. All additional gear - tent, sleeping bag, mat, cooking kit, rope, axe, shovel, grapnel hook, spare ski, spare clothes, repair kit, medical kit, camera, shotgun, lithium batteries, fluorescent marker poles, paddle - would total another 220lb; too much for a single sledge travelling in Arctic rubble ice, so I had to use two sledges. </p> <p>This meant every mile gained to the north would involve three travelled on the ground. A one-sledge trip is dangerous enough, in that blizzards and white-outs are common. Perspective is wiped out and ski tracks become invisible. You are in a world of cotton wool, or white night, able to see only your own body: all else is a grey-white blur. In such conditions the need to relay sledges involves a potentially lethal risk - once you have parked the first sledge and set off for your second load, you may never find it. At some point you will decide, because of the cold, to return to the first sledge. But it, too, may be impossible to find. You will then die. </p> <p>My schedule took the extra mileage into account. If I could travel north for 10 hours every day for 80 days, with no rest day for injuries, bad weather or watery obstacles, my best progress would be 500 yards a day for the first three days, 1.4 miles daily for the next 30 days, 4.5 miles daily until day 58 and then, with a single sledge only, 11 miles daily to the Pole. </p> <p>On 14 February I flew to the most northerly of Canada's meteorological stations, at Eureka, where musk oxen and wolves roam the hills around the airstrip. After refuelling, my friend Karl Z'berg piloted the Twin Otter 100 miles further north to the north end of Ward Hunt Island, the starting point of most North Pole attempts. With lurching bumps, we were down. As the door opened, I felt the bitter cold. The sun would not show its face here for three more weeks, and then only for 30 minutes a day. I would travel by moonlight and head torch. When the ski-plane had gone, I took a bearing to geographical north. I could not use the North Star because it was almost directly overhead. </p> <p>The clothing policy I had evolved over 28 years of polar expeditions was based on non-stop movement and light, breathable clothes. Any halt, however brief, could lead to hypothermia. Once my metabolism was up and running, pumping blood furiously to my extremities, I took off my duck-down duvet and stuffed it in the sledge next to my vacuum flask and shotgun. Now I was wearing only a thin wickaway vest and long johns under a black jacket and trousers made of 100 per cent Ventile cotton. Cotton is not windproof so body heat is not sealed in. Alas, no modern material is completely breathable so, when pulling excessive loads over difficult terrain, you perspire. The sweat turns to ice inside the clothing and can quickly lead to hypothermia. Cotton is still the best compromise. </p> <p>My schedule allowed two days to reach the edge of the sea. But I kept going without a rest and established both sledges at the coastline within seven hours. This boded well, for the sledges were running easily despite their full loads, the low temperature and soft, deep snow. </p> <p>After seven hours of hard man-hauling, I was cold and tired. I erected the tent in six minutes and started the cooker in four. These two acts, which I had practised thousands of times, are the key to survival, and with two usable hands can be performed easily in extreme temperatures, high winds and blizzards. I got into my sleeping bag, drank some energy drink, ate chocolate and set my alarm watch for three hours. </p> <p>The weather was clear when I woke and the sea ice quiet to the north, a sign that the ice floes were not on the move. The moon had vanished behind the hills, meaning I would not be able to differentiate between solid ice and thinly skinned zones, so the ice-silence indicating static floes was a bonus. </p> <p>Over the past 15 years with Mike Stroud, I had three times broken the current world record for unsupported travel to the North Pole. Each time the ice conditions north of Ward Hunt Island were invariably horrible. I saw that this year the walls and rubble were split everywhere by recent breakage. My schedule of 500 yards a day for the first three miles began to look optimistic. </p> <p>I pressed on over the fissure dividing land from sea and into a broad belt of rubble. I took my skis off. For a few hundred yards I would have to haul each sledge over a vista similar to that of postwar Berlin. Between each ice slab, deep snow covered the fissures. I often fell into traps, sinking waist deep. </p> <p>I came to a wall of slabs 15ft high and decided to test the simple pulley system devised by my base leader, 'Mac' Mackenney. I attached it to the big sledge and tugged it jerkily up the 45-degree slope to the top. Too late I heard movement, and leapt towards the sledge which quickly gathered momentum in its slide over the edge of the wall. I managed to grab the rear end, but my body weight was not enough. The far side of the wall was a sheer 15ft drop on to sharp ice blocks. I landed hard. I was winded but unhurt. </p> <p>At first the sledge looked undamaged, but closer inspection revealed a 16in tear under the bow. The floatability of the sledge's hull, designed to be completely watertight, was compromised. There was no alternative but to head back to the hut on Ward Hunt Island and find substitute materials to effect a repair. </p> <p>In the mid Eighties we had erected a canvas cover over the steel skeleton of a hut long abandoned by scientists and installed a couple of wind-powered generators to provide electricity. With minimal safety gear in a bag, I skied for two hours back up my own outward trail and then headed east along the base of the mountain. The old huts looked like a ghost camp, unchanged over the 12 years since my last visit. </p> <p>After an hour spent digging out the door of our old hut, I gained entry. There were a few tools and canvas materials, so I decided to bring the sledge back to make it watertight. I skied back to the sledges and loaded minimal camping gear on to the smaller one. Then I lashed the damaged sledge on top. Uphill through soft snow was slow going, some seven hours back to the hut. </p> <p>I put my tent up inside the hut. The temperature outside had fallen to minus 49 degrees C. With the cooker on, a hot drink inside me and fully clothed, I began the repairs. Some hours later I was back at the ice edge. </p> <p>I camped on thin ice but woke to hear all manner of noises: cracking and rumbling, then silence. Then, a nearby and frightening roar that galvanised me into movement from the depths of my sleeping bag. The moon was full, the scenery startlingly beautiful. Moonshadows played about the upended ice blocks and the ice shapes took on an uncanny resemblance to animals, castles or giant mushrooms. </p> <p>I pressed on northwards. I dared not take either sledge too far, because the surface between the rubble fields consisted of very thin ice through which my probing ski-stick passed with ease into the waters below. After eight hours I had moved both sledges more than a mile to the north. My morale was high as I was making good progress. I ate a chocolate bar every two hours to ward off hypothermia, but was beginning to tire so I decided to camp on any flat surface that looked solid. I came to a zone of interlacing fractures. The moon had vanished, but whenever I stopped I heard the grumble of ice on the move. To avoid a trench of black water, I mounted a bridge of foot-thick slabs, buckled by floe pressure. I had the small sledge with me and the big one 500 yards to the south. I clambered over the slabs with my skis on. The sledge followed easily in my wake. </p> <p> There was no warning. A slab tilted under the sledge, which pulled me backwards. I fell on my back and slid down the slab. The noise that followed was the one I most hate to hear in the Arctic - a splash. The sledge was in the sea. </p> <p>I kicked out with my skis and flailed at the slab with both hands. One ski boot plunged into the sea and one gloved hand found an edge of a static slab. Taking a firm grip, I pulled my wet foot and ski out of the water and managed to unfasten my harness. I was already beginning to shiver. I squirmed around until I could sit on a flatter slab to inspect the sledge in the gloom. </p> <p>It was under water, but not sinking. Seventy days' worth of food and 30 of fuel were on that sledge - and the communications gear: without it the expedition was over. A nearby slab crashed into the sea: the ice was moving. I had to save the sledge quickly. Soon I would be dangerously cold. </p> <p>I pushed up my jacket sleeve and took off my outer mitt. In retrospect I may have been better off keeping it on, but I had to feel for the submerged rope. For a minute or so I could not find the snag. Then, by jiggling the rope sharply, it came free. I pulled hard and the sledge rose to the surface. My wet hand was numb, but I could not replace the mitt until the sledge was out of the sea. Gradually the prow rose on to a slab and water cascaded off its canvas cover. Minutes later the sledge was on 'dry land'. I danced about like a madman. Both my mitts were back on and I used my 'cold hands revival technique' to restore life to the numb fingers. This involves a fast windmill motion with the fingers. Usually the blood returns painfully to all my fingers: this time it did not. I took off the mitt. </p> <p>My fingers were ramrod stiff and ivory white. They might as well have been wooden. I knew that if I let my good hand go even partially numb, I would be unable to erect the tent and start the cooker, which I needed to do quickly for I was shivering. </p> <p>I returned to the big sledge. The next 30 minutes were a nightmare. The sledge-cover zip jammed. Precious minutes went by before I could free it and start erecting the tent. My teeth were chattering violently and my good hand was numb. I had to get the cooker going in minutes or it would be too late. I crawled into the partially erect tent, closed its door-zip and began a 20-minute battle to start the cooker. </p> <p>I could not use the petrol lighter with my fingers, but I found some matches I could hold in my teeth. Starting an extremely cold petrol cooker involves careful priming so that just the right amount of fuel seeps into the pad below the fuel jet. Using my teeth and a numb index finger, I finally worked the pump enough to squirt fuel on to the pad, but was slow in shutting the valve: when I applied the match a three-foot flame reached to the roof. Luckily I'd had a flame lining installed, so the tent was undamaged. And the cooker was alight - one of the best moments of my life. </p> <p>Slowly and painfully some life came back into the fingers of my good hand. An hour later, with my body warm again, I unlaced my wet boot. Only two toes had been affected. Soon they would exhibit big blood blisters and lose their nails, but they had escaped frostbite. </p> <p> I was in no doubt as to the fate of my bad hand. I had seen enough frostbite to realise I was in trouble. I had to get to a hospital quickly to save some fingers. </p> <p>I set out in great trepidation. Five hours later I was back on the ice shelf. I erected the tent properly and spent three hours massaging my good hand and wet foot over the cooker. From there, the journey to the hut took for ever. Once I fell asleep on the move and woke in a trough of soft snow well away from my intended route. </p> <p>When I came to the hut I prepared the communications gear. I spoke to Morag Howell in Resolute Bay. She promised to evacuate me the following day. The fingers on my left hand began to grow great liquid blisters. The pain was bad so I raided my medical stores for drugs. </p> <p>The next day I found an airstrip near the hut and marked its ends with kerosene rags. When I heard the ski-plane, I lit the rags and an hour later I was on my way to Eureka. Thirty-six hours after that I was at Ottawa General Hospital watching as a surgeon stripped skin and sliced blisters from my fingers. For the next two weeks I received daily treatment in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. Back in England I allowed the damaged tissue to slowly heal in readiness for the end-knuckles of the thumb and each finger to be amputated. I took penicillin for four months to keep gangrene out of the open cracks, where the damaged but live flesh met the dead and blackened finger-ends. By the end of June I was able to saw the dead finger-ends off with a fret-saw. This helped the new stump areas heal in readiness for final surgery by a plastic surgeon. </p> <p>I suppose, over 26 years of polar travel, the frostbite odds were always narrowing. This time they caught up with me. It's a shame because everything was looking good. But there is never any point in crying over spilt milk: in order to win at some of the big ones, you will always lose at others along the way. The key is to learn from the failures and then to keep going.</p>"
