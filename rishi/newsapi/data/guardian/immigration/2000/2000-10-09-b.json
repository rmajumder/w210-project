  "<p>Of the 10 men who have been in charge of the England football team over the past 54 years, Kevin Keegan will be remembered as a cheerleader who denied Wembley one last hurrah and then quit while he was behind. </p> <p>Keegan's sudden resignation five minutes after his team had lost Saturday's World Cup qualifier 1-0 to Germany concludes the most bizarre period yet in the quirky history of national managers. </p> <p>The England coach had taken over 20 months earlier following the Football Association's decision to sack Glenn Hoddle once the prime minister, put on the spot in a day-time TV chat show, had muttered that if Hoddle really had implied the disabled were paying for the sins of past lives he ought to go.</p> <p>In view of what has happened now Hoddle might have been referring to the FA international committee, for if ever a body is reaping the whirlwind of past misdeeds it is surely this one. </p> <p>Bobby Robson took England to the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup but his contract was not renewed, Terry Venables had already decided not to sign a fresh contract by the time England reached the last four of Euro 96, the committee having expressed doubts about his legal wrangles with Alan Sugar and the Department of Trade and Industry, and Hoddle's sin was to express his beliefs clumsily to a national newspaper. </p> <p>The timing of Keegan's departure was totally predictable. His temperament and lack of tactical nous made him a bad choice from the start. </p> <p>When he originally agreed to take the job for four matches, while remaining manager of Fulham, Keegan promised that the players would sing the national anthem with passion and bring a similar mood to their performances. Well, not all of the team were singing before Saturday's match and not enough of them were in harmony during the game to form a barber's shop quartet.</p> <p>Keegan also stressed that in no way would he leave Fulham once his four-match stint had ended. After two games in charge, however, he decided that \"it's time to stop playing games - I want the job\". On Saturday he again decided it was time to stop playing games, only now he believed he was not up to the job after all. In other words after taking the England post saying I'm sorry I'll read that again he has abandoned it admitting I'm sorry I haven't a clue. </p> <p>Keegan's plea of mea culpa - \"I'm blaming nobody but myself. I wasn't good enough\" - the revelation that during England's awful first half that he did not know what to do, his apparent self-sacrifice in order to hand the squad over to someone with more knowledge and the hardly original thought that he wants to spend more time with his family will cut little ice with experienced Kev-watchers. </p> <p>He has walked out after a defeat that made it imperative that he stayed for at least four more days in order to give England the best chance of repairing the damage, serious though hardly mortal, to their chances of qualifying for the World Cup caused by an initial home defeat. Instead of which Howard Wilkinson, the FA's technical director, will again pop up like George, the inflatable automatic pilot in Airplane, to take over the team for Wednesday's qualifier in Finland.</p> <p>When Don Revie quit on England during a World Cup qualifying campaign the FA tried, unsuccessfully, to ban him from football for 10 years. True, Keegan did not conduct covert negotiations with the United Arab Emirates before giving his resignation exclusively to a newspaper but his defection is scarcely more admirable. </p> <p>If, as he insists, he enjoyed the full support of everybody at the FA from the chairman to the Lancaster Gate cat then surely he could have given the job one more chance. </p> <p>Keegan's excuse that the fans who clamoured successfully for his appointment had helped him make up his mind on Saturday by booing him as he left the arena is barely worth consideration. If every England manager had walked out after being jeered at Wembley Alf Ramsey, Ron Greenwood, Bobby Robson, Graham Taylor and Glenn Hoddle would not have lasted anywhere near as long as they did.</p> <p>According to Adam Crozier, the FA's chief executive who has limited experience of these things: \"It is never easy to say I'm not going to be England coach any more. To walk away from that is a very courageous thing to do.\" Yet surely it would have been even more courageous to stay put, tough it out, and risk the probability of being ditched by the FA if the team also lost in Helsinki. </p> <p>It is not as if Keegan had a rough ride from the media, who let him down relatively lightly after the debacle of Euro 2000. Keegan was never vilified in the press as Robson was more than once. He was never lampooned as cruelly as Taylor nor hung out to dry like Hoddle. The heat in Keegan's kitchen barely rose above gas mark one. </p> <p>Crozier was nearer the mark, albeit unwittingly,when he observed that \"I think Kevin Keegan knew he was making the right decision for Kevin Keegan\". That is surely the point. </p> <p>On Saturday Keegan made all the right self-deprecatory noises in the interviews. He is a master of the soundbite and it is a pity that his tactical know-how in handling reporters' questions was not matched by an ability to organise the England team. </p> <p>\"I just feel that for Kevin Keegan there is nothing more in football I want to do,\" he said a trifle wistfully. Presumably this precludes returning to TV as a soccer pundit. Surely he can never sit in judgment on England again having admitted that he did not know enough when he was in charge.</p> <p> o You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Those who doubt the wisdom of the Human Rights Act tend to see the rights and freedoms in the European Convention on Human Rights in terms of absolutes - leading on the one hand to a culture of rights without responsibilities, and on the other to a situation where rights are at risk of being removed by judges who are unelected and unaccountable. There is a balance to be struck if our human rights law is to win and retain public confidence. </p> <p>The court's task is to strike a fair balance between the interest of the community and the protection of the individual. I agree with those who say that the purpose of the Convention is to create a fair and decent society, not to let criminals off the hook, and that victims and witnesses have rights too. </p> <p>Some guidance as to where this will all lead us is available from north of the border. The system of devolution that was created for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland requires the devolved legislatures and executives to legislate and to act in a manner compatible with the Convention rights. In Scotland, since devolution in May 1999, lawyers have been active in raising issues about possible incompatibility. But statistics about the success rate of Scottish cases are an imperfect guide to what will happen north and south of the border now that the Human Rights Act has come into force. [The Human Rights Act covers all public authorities; the Scotland Act, under which cases have been brought north of the border since May 1999, covers only the devolved legislature and executive.] In Scotland the great majority of issues raised have been in criminal cases, not in the much wider field over which the Human Rights Act now extends and these issues have been directed almost entirely to the acts of the public prosecutor. So the development of the case law has been on a narrow front. </p> <p>The low success rate in Scotland (one assessment suggests that of more than 600 legal challenges in the past 12 months only 16 have been successful) is largely due to the fact that many challenges relate to elements of the right to a fair trial, such as delay, admissibility of evidence and the effect of prejudicial publicity. The Scottish judges have been following the European Court of Human Rights in deciding that the fairness of the trial must be determined in the light of the proceedings as a whole, and are discouraging attempts to have these issues determined before conclusion of the trial. But now that the way is open for challenges across the entire field of action by public authorities the success rate is much less predictable. My guess is that it is likely to increase. </p> <p>What is likely to happen next? Judges are urging lawyers to be restrained in the cases they bring, and are urging their colleagues to be robust in refusing to allow such challenges, as indeed they should be if they are plainly unmeritorious. On the other hand, the Lord Chancellor has said that the value of the Human Rights Act lies in the fact that people will be saved the trouble of taking their cases to the court in Strasbourg. It seems to me that there is an uneasy relationship between these two points of view. </p> <p>If people are to be saved the trouble of going to Strasbourg they will have to be able to obtain their remedy here. The fact that it is simpler and quicker to apply to the courts of this country is bound to lead in the short term, as it has in Scotland, to a great increase in the number of cases. But I do not see this as reason for treating such applications any more robustly than any other kind of application, or for asking lawyers to exercise greater restraint in bringing them than they would in other cases. The tradition in this country is that the courts are open to any person who feels his rights have been infringed. Lawyers owe a duty of care to their clients, and the House of Lords recently held that even in the courtroom they no longer have immunity against claims for negligence. So the judges are in no position to complain if counsel err on the side of caution in their own interest in making these applications. They must also appreciate that the courts, as public authorities, are themselves under a duty of compliance with the Convention rights. The UK will still be under an obligation in international law to bring its domestic law into line with the Convention as interpreted by that court, even if this conflicts with the view taken by our judges. So I would favour caution, in the initial stages at least, rather than robustness - lest, in a fit of enthusiasm for throwing cases out, the judges find themselves on the wrong end of a challenge under article six of the Convention, the right to a fair hearing. </p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited extract of a lecture by Lord Hope to the law reform group Justice.</p>",
  "A Labour thinktank will this week call for the voucher system for asylum seekers to be scrapped and a human rights commission to be set up in a report to be launched by the home secretary, Jack Straw. <p>The commission on the future of multi-ethnic Britain, which included Labour peer, Lord Bhikhu Parekh, and Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Greater London assembly, is to call upon the government to declare Britain a multi-cultural society. </p> <p>The commission, set up by the Runnymede Trust, says that Mr Straw's policies of dispersing asylum seekers and forcing them to live on below-the-breadline vouchers have created \"statelessness and racial and ethnic divisions\". It calls for them to be given cash support and for their rights to appeal against deportations to be restored. </p> <p>Mr Straw is unlikely to concede these changes but the Home Office yesterday insisted that other proposals are under official consideration. </p> <p>The Home Office minister, Mike O'Brien, said: \"Many of the recommendations cover areas where action is in hand. Where there are new suggestions we will look at these.\" </p> <p>Lord Parekh, the commission chairman, said one of the first steps should be a declaration that Britain is a multi-cultural society, as has happened in the US, Australia and Canada. \"It is a way of saying to ethnic minorities and the world that we not only tolerate but cherish our diversity.\" He said it would not just be a formal statement but would mean that annual ceremonies such as Remembrance Day would begin to reflect the contribution of Britain's diverse communities. </p> <p>The two-year study also calls for an independent investigation of complaints against the police, of all deaths in custody and for publicity campaigns to ensure the public know their rights if stopped and searched. </p> <p>A major proposal is to set up a human rights commission and an equalities commission, which would involve the merger of the commission for racial equality, the equal opportunities commission and the disability rights commission. A single equality act would update the 1976 legislation on race and sex discrimination. </p> <p>The report is also expected to recommend government-set targets for reducing the number of pupils from particular minority ethnic communities who are excluded from school. </p> <p>It urges that national working parties be set up to evaluate the race equality impact of Ofsted inspections at schools and local authorities. Schools should also be given guidance on how subjects could be given an international and multicultural dimension. </p> <p>\u0095 A trust set up by the late Labour MP Bernie Grant to promote racial justice and social development is to be launched at the Commons today.</p>",
  "Gerontophiles, and those who simply like a good ornery character, were delighted when Richard Farnsworth, who has died aged 80, became the oldest best actor Oscar nominee ever for his lead role in David Lynch's The Straight Story (1999). Farnsworth, a former stuntman, had waited over 60 years for just such a part: \"It feels a lot better because I'm getting up there in age and might not have a chance again.\" <p>The Straight Story told the true and picaresque tale of Alvin Straight, a septuagenarian widower who sets out from Iowa, driving a lawn mower, on a 380-mile trip to Wisconsin to see his estranged brother, who has suffered a stroke. The film extolled slowness and age, ideas which were almost seditious in a country which worships youth, speed and the automobile. </p> <p>Farnsworth, with his weathered face, scraggy beard, and his blue eyes alert if watery, perfectly portrayed the dignity, individuality and stubbornness of the man. He was Lynch's first choice for the role, but he was scheduled to have hip replacement surgery, and was using a cane when the casting call came. When he heard that the character used two canes, he delayed the surgery and took the part. He was diagnosed several years ago with cancer, which had left him partially paralysed, and he struggled with the pain while working on the film. </p> <p>\"He was very ill in that movie, but, phenomenally, he made it through. He didn't want the world to know he was sick,\" said Jewely Van Valin, who had shared his life for the last 11 years. She was in the next room of their New Mexico ranch when she heard the gun shot with which he killed himself. </p> <p>Farnsworth, a third-generation Californian, spent almost 30 years working as a movie stuntman. He left school at 15 during the Depression, and worked as a stable boy at a polo barn, where many actors played in their leisure time. In 1937, two men from MGM came looking for horses, and for someone who could ride them, for The Marx Brothers' movie, A Day At The Races. Farnsworth followed this with work as a Mongolian horseman in The Adventures Of Marco Polo (1938), and stunted for years for leading Western stars, including Joel McCrea, Gary Cooper and Henry Fonda. </p> <p>Farnsworth was also a good swordsman, which earned him the job of playing Kirk Douglas's double in Spartacus (1960), even though he remarked that, with his skinny legs, he looked more like \"a crane in a short skirt\". He then started to get bit parts, mainly in Westerns, as stage coach drivers or cowboys, but his real breakthrough came in Alan Pakula's Comes A Horseman (1978), in which he played Jane Fonda's old ranch hand Dodger, a part for which he was Oscar-nominated as best supporting actor. The character, representing the Old West, is thrown from his horse because of the sound of blasting for oil. He is brought back home, but climbs back on his horse, preferring to die outside under the stars. </p> <p>Farnsworth also played a Wyoming rancher in Tom Horn (1980) with Steve McQueen, but his first leading role was in The Grey Fox (1982), the story of Bill Miner, stagecoach robber, who emerges from 33 years in prison into the 20th century. According to Roger Ebert: \"Farnsworth is one of those unstudied, graceful, absolutely natural actors who has spent a lifetime acting exactly as he feels. I think he is incapable of a false or a dishonest moment. He makes Miner so proud, so vulnerable, such a noble rascal, that the whole movie becomes a little more complex.\" </p> <p>Farnsworth represented both the Old West and the Old Hollywood. Of The Straight Story, he said: \"There wasn't one four-letter word in this movie. I'll tell you I'm really disappointed in what people seem to want nowadays - action, sex, violence, four-letter words. I've turned down quite a bit of work because there's too many four-letter words.\" His more folksy roles (including TV series such as Bonanza and The Big Valley) didn't allow him to be much more than a loveable old coot, until Lynch made his offer. </p> <p>Farnsworth, whose wife of 38 years died in 1985, is survived by their daughter Missy, and son Diamond - who is also a top stuntman.</p> <p>\u0095 Richard Farnsworth, actor, born September 1 1920; died October 6 2000.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Ed Pilkington Foreign editor, the Guardian</strong> </p> <p> We have Gillian Sandford as our regular stringer there. She came out of Belgrade earlier in the year and it took her about three months to get a visa. All our main correspondents were refused a visa. It's been horrendously difficult, but on Thursday Jonathan Steele got in. We've done quite a lot of updating on the wires as [reports] come in because if you're right in the middle of it, it's actually quite difficult to know everything that's going on. In some senses, we know more here than they do. </p> <p> <strong> Maggie O'Kane The Guardian</strong> </p> <p> The truth is that, eventually, almost all journalists who cover the Balkans don't get visas anymore. You're the odd one out if you do get one. Most of the journalists who were in there came on tourist visas because there really wasn't any other way. That makes it much harder to report because you have to be careful where you stay. You can't stay in the hotels because you could be very easily found and so you have to rely on people's goodwill - and they have to be people who are aware of what the situation was when you came in. </p> <p> <strong> Stephen Robinson Foreign editor, the Telegraph</strong> </p> <p> Our main correspondent went in a few days ago overland from Budapest. He's been banned before and has some stamp in his passport, so he's trying to be careful. The Telegraph always seems to be the first to be thrown out. We've sent a lot of people there, aware that they might not all get in. The TV pictures were striking, but I don't think they did a very good job of analysing the situation and putting it in context, which I think the newspapers generally did better. </p> <p> <strong> Leonard Doyle Foreign editor, the Independent</strong> </p> <p> We've got a staff correspondent in Belgrade who's basically been operating below the radar and secured the first newspaper interview with Kostunica. We have a long-standing Serbian journalist, Vesna Peric Zimonjic, there as well, andhave sent another correspondent. There has been a certain amount of wire-watching but we've been blessed by having seasoned and experienced reporters over there. </p> <p> <strong> Mark Dowdney Foreign editor, the Mirror</strong> </p> <p> We've always been very outspoken in our criticisms of Milosevic and, of course, they monitor the papers and they pay us back by refusing to let our staff in. We couldn't get a visa this time, but we sent Anton Antonowicz and Mike Moore to Montenegro and they went two or three days ago in the hope that we could get in through there. It's a big, big story and we're giving it a lot of attention. I think the Sun blundered by not putting it on their front page on Friday. </p> <p> <strong> Nigel Prichard Press officer, CNN</strong> </p> <p> We opened a Belgrade bureau after the Kosovo conflict. We knew it was going to come to a head at some point, so for the last few months we've been planning. Twenty-four hour news is all about live pictures and unfortunately the others didn't seem to have done that. CNN was the only rolling news channel to have live pictures of Belgrade on Thursday night. ITN, BBC and Sky missed everything. It was strange because if you lived in Serbia you were able to watch what was happening live via CNN because we were broadcasting via their state television, but in the UK, only if you were tuned into CNN could you see what was going on </p> <p> <strong> Nick Pollard Head of Sky News</strong> </p> <p> During the Kosovo crisis our viewership in eastern Europe really seemed to take off and in reporting Belgrade on Thursday night it really showed because our phone-in programmes were flooded with people calling and faxing and emailing from Serbia and Kosovo and all around there. We were also very fortunate to get a call from a British lad who was with the demonstrators and a very good local producer who did a running commentary on everything that was hap pening. But as far as I can see, the only people who had live pictures were CNN. All credit to them. </p> <p> <strong> Nigel Dacre Editor, ITV news at ITN</strong> </p> <p> It's a very difficult country to get into. Hopefully that will change now. We're very experienced at being in Belgrade, though on Thursday we were relying on agency pictures and pictures from Belgrade TV. This is a massive story for us. We are putting a lot of resources into it. We've sent three teams and a satellite dish. So, for us, the coverage is working well. </p> <p> <strong> Dominic Crossley-Holland Deputy editor, ITN 24-hour news</strong> </p> <p> On Thursday night we chucked out the set 15-minute wheel of bulletins and went for live, extended coverage of Belgrade. The difference between us and other channels was if you tuned in to us you didn't often see boring studio shots with a presenter interviewing an expert. The BBC came off air about two or three hours before ITN with its open-ended Belgrade coverage, and by later in the evening it was running hours of William Hague. </p> <p> <strong> Mark Ogle Press officer, BBC news</strong> </p> <p> We started with the Belgrade correspondent Jackie Rowland there and John Simpson in Montenegro. On Thursday, John wasn't being allowed in, but in his own inimitable style he got in a car with a fixer and legged it across the border and got to Belgrade just in time to do live reports as things were unfolding. John has tended to concentrate on TV while Jackie has been doing all the radio bulletins. But I believe he and Jackie were the only terrestrial TV broadcasters who managed to get there on Thursday. I certainly think the BBC did very well. John was reporting live on the phone and reporting while he was being tear-gassed in the crowd. </p> <p> <strong> Louise Muddle Press officer, Channel 4 news</strong> </p> <p> We couldn't get any visas so we didn't have anyone in up until Friday. Obvi ously we've been trying for the past couple of weeks, but they weren't issuing them. We had a fixer on the ground in Belgrade who arranged phone interviews for us, including the only broadcast interview with Kostunica. We've been monitoring and using Serb TV, CNN pictures and agency pictures. But by Thursday we just weren't able to get our journalists in.</p>",
  "<p>The debate raging over fuel prices in Europe is a signal that something has to be done about transport. </p> <p>The answer is within our grasp. It is time to put prices on roads - to bring in \"congestion charging\" all over Britain and not just in London. We have the electronic technology to do so and, in reducing the traffic jams that plague our lives, the country would benefit enormously. </p> <p>Road tolls would make our roads flow again. That would be good for firms' profitability, for people's marriages and stress levels, for the environment and especially for our grandchildren's well-being. </p> <p>The money raised could be spent in useful ways, such as reducing other taxes - including those on fuel - and improving public services and infrastructure. Our present fuel tax is a blunt instrument: it penalises those on empty lanes as much as those on the M25, and it does little to change the amount of traffic. </p> <p>Building roads is not the answer. In the past 20 years car traffic has doubled. The rise shows no sign of flattening. Yet Britain still has far fewer cars per head than the US. Something has to be done if the next generation of Britons is not to be overwhelmed by jams, smog and concrete. </p> <p>Although we pay petrol and road fund taxes, we are free to use any particular British road. Imagine what would happen if supermarkets gave away their products for free or nearly free. There would be queues outside every store. People would have to get up early and allocate periods in their diaries just to buy food. </p> <p>It would be no use building wider front doors to these supermarkets (the let's build more roads approach), or having special paths into supermarkets that only certain people could use (the bus lane approach). As soon as the queue started to shorten, other consumers would notice and come to the new wide-entrance supermarkets. </p> <p>The supermarkets would be better advised to put prices on their goods. That is what they do - and it works. Britain's roads could be like this. They could flow without queues. </p> <p>Every economist knows that a queue forms when a demand and supply mechanism fails. Using the price system to ration things is the most sensible way. This is what we do for steel ingots, newspapers, cream teas and everything else. It is especially necessary on roads because drivers do not bear in mind when they make a journey that their presence on the road creates an \"externality\" for others. </p> <p>Traffic congestion especially distorts the lives of our most highly skilled workers. Commuting time for Britons with university degrees is one and a half times as long as for others. In south-east England, a quarter of all those with university degrees spend more than two hours a day travelling to and from work. </p> <p>The British simply shrug their shoulders and accept that it is impossible to drive to Heathrow airport at 8.30 am; we design our lives around traffic jams. We should not. Road pricing would make our roads run freely again - and that would be good for the efficiency of the economy. </p> <p>There are objections to road pricing. The most common is that road tolls would raise firms' costs. It would not. Road pricing would make life cheaper for firms in Britain. Tolls would be set at the right level to make traffic flow freely - and no higher. </p> <p>A road toll of \u00a35, say, would be negligible for a lorry carrying \u00a3100,000 of goods. But it would be a lot of money to a person going to the shops for a newspaper or heading off to a leisure centre for squash before work or a parent taking a child to school because it is raining. The toll would take such users off the road and out of the lorry's way. </p> <p>A lorry journey time that is cut by 10 minutes would easily be worth the toll. Thus road pricing would cut companies' costs and make the economy work more efficiently. </p> <p>It would be a simple matter for a government to set tolls on lorries at a different level from those on cars. </p> <p>Why then do some road users say they are against congestion charging? It is because people do not realise, when answering opinion polls, that road tolls would clear the roads. After an experimental week of road tolls, Britain would never wish to go back to the jams of toll-free roads. </p> <p>Another criticism is that road pricing would hurt the poor. It would not. </p> <p>Sensible road tolls would be designed to be high at peak times. Those on high wages would travel then and pay for the privilege. People on low incomes could choose to travel at other times of the day when the tolls were low or even zero. </p> <p>Most people in the lowest fifth of income distribution in Britain do not own a car. They would be unaffected by road charges. </p> <p>Several methods of tackling road congestion are possible: </p> <p>electronic road pricing (ERP) schemes, cordon tolls or toll booths; </p> <p>restricted access at certain times or on certain days to different coloured/numbered cars - as in Athens and Mexico City; </p> <p>metered parking in residential areas near central business districts; </p> <p>closing roads to cars at certain busier times (Oxford); </p> <p>and toll bridges (the two Severn bridges). </p> <p>Schemes that involve directly banning drivers infringe personal freedom and are less desirable than road pricing. </p> <p>The best method would be ERP, where variable tariffs reflect the marginal external costs of a trip. </p> <p>In Spain, France, Italy, Japan and some US states, the toll revenue is used to finance new motorways. Other ERP systems have been installed in Barcelona, Lisbon, Dallas, Oklahoma and Florida. </p> <p>Oslo has had a system in place since 1990 using electronic tags and beacons around the central business district. Singapore is testing a newer system and Stockholm is beginning a similar scheme for its ring road. </p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Oswald is professor of economics at Warwick University</p>",
  "The whereabouts of Marko Milosevic, the son of the deposed Serbian president, were unclear last night after the millionaire underworld figure was reported to have flown into Moscow with his wife and infant son. <p>In acknowledging the victory of the Serbian insurgency against his regime on Friday night, Slobodan Milosevic claimed he was happy to be relieved of the burdens of office so he could spend more time with his grandson, another Marko, aged one. </p> <p>But hours later the infant was whisked on to a Yugoslav airline flight to Moscow, according to a Belgrade news agency, with his mother Zorica and notoriously brutish father. </p> <p>Marko Milosevic fled a lynch mob in his hometown of Pozarevac, south-east of Belgrade, where he owned the Madonna night club, the Bambiland children's theme park, and other interests. </p> <p>Rumours were circulating in Moscow last night that Marko had been seen at a window of the Yugoslav embassy, where his uncle, Borislav Milosevic, is the Yugoslav ambassador. </p> <p>The Marko Milosevic family left behind scenes of looting. Marko's Madonna nightclub has been ransacked as have the cosmetics shop he owned in Belgrade and his computer equipment store and bakery in Pozarevac. </p> <p>While he and his family were believed to be in Russia, perhaps on their way to Belarus - where President Alexander Lukashenko has signalled that he will look favourably on any \"asylum\" requests from the Milosevic clique - the whereabouts of his mother, Mirjana Markovic and his sister Milica are not known.</p>",
  "Israel yesterday choked back its fury at the kidnapping of three soldiers, holding off on threats to bomb Hizbullah guerrillas and Syrian installations in Lebanon to explore prospects of a prisoner swap to win their release. <p>But as Israeli warplanes flew over Beirut and hundreds of tanks rumbled northwards, there was a pervasive sense of dread that four months of relative quiet along the Lebanese border could give way to open confrontation - and that Syria could be dragged into the war. </p> <p>The kidnapping of the three soldiers by Hizbullah guerrillas, followed by shelling along the border, is the most serious rupture in an uneasy calm that has prevailed since May, when Israel ended its 22-year occupation of south Lebanon. </p> <p>Apart from tense stand-offs between Israeli soldiers and stone-throwing Lebanese at border crossings, the peace held until Saturday afternoon, when the soldiers - two Israeli Jews and a Bedouin - were snatched during a patrol of the Sheba'a border region, which Hizbullah claims as Lebanese territory. There has been no news on them since. </p> <p>On Saturday, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, warned Lebanon and Syria, the real power in that country, that he would take \"forceful action\" to secure the release of the soldiers. Yesterday, he reinforced that message by charging Syria with \"supreme responsibility to ensure there will be no hostile actions against Israel from Lebanon\". </p> <p>In return, Hizbullah's leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, said that his men would retaliate in force if Israel attacked Lebanon. \"We will make the enemy understand that Lebanon is not too weak to take revenge.\" </p> <p>From Damascus, the al-Ba'ath newspaper, the mouthpiece of the ruling party, weighed in by dismissing Mr Barak's threats as \"frivolous\". \"Such language has not intimidated either Syria or Lebanon,\" the paper said. </p> <p>Behind the rhetoric there are international efforts to get the three soldiers back safely, probably by trading Lebanese who have been held hostage in Israeli jails for years. </p> <p>The Israeli cabinet secretary, Yitzhak Herzog, said that \"major international efforts\" were going on to find the three soldiers, involving Mr Barak, the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, and the Red Cross. </p> <p>Reports from Beirut said that Hizbullah was seeking German mediation to organise an exchange of the three soldiers for men held in Israeli jails. Hizbullah reportedly wants the release of 19 Lebanese, as well as scores of Palestinian detainees, members of the Islamic Jihad and Hamas. </p> <p>However, the prospects for an exchange are deeply clouded. Yesterday, a spokesman for Mr Barak told army radio that he expected a \"sign of life\" from the kidnapped men before Israel embarked on negotiations for their release.

It retaliated by kidnapping Lebanese militia leaders and detaining them for years, referring to them as \"bargaining chips\" in the campaign to win information about Mr Arad's fate. </p> <p>Although the Israeli government released about 13 Lebanese last spring, it has stubbornly hung on to its two prize catches: a Lebanese guerrilla leader seized in 1994 and a cleric kidnapped in 1989.Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid, and Mustafa Dirani, the security chief of the Amal Shia militia, have been seen only once since their capture, when they appeared in open court earlier this year. </p> <p>Giving them up now would represent an unacceptable surrender by Mr Barak in the eyes of many Israelis. It would also undermine the sole achievement of his tenure: the withdrawal from south Lebanon.</p>",

  "I met \"dodgy Dave\" seven years ago on the mighty cobalt-blue San Rafael glacier surging down from the northern Patagonian ice sheet, just a few hundred miles from the tip of south America. It was pouring with rain, he was living out of a rucksack, eating unimaginably bad food, climbing mountains, measuring glacier melt and reroofing barns. He couldn't believe his luck. Raleigh International, with help from his local authority, had sent him to a Chilean wilderness to learn the age-old British establishment arts of initiative training, teamwork and character-building. <p>Dave, frankly, didn't care much for the outdoor life. But he knew about survival, specifically on the streets of Newcastle upon Tyne. Like Prince William, who has just arrived at San Rafael to begin his 10-week expedition in Patagonia, he was one of Raleigh International's \"venturers\", but one of the few who come from what Raleigh call \"at risk\" backgrounds. </p> <p>Dave, like Prince William, came to Chile with a personal history that most of the 17 to 25 year olds who go on to Raleigh's 10 annual expeditions could only gasp at. By 18, he had been in and out of reform schools and been done several times for nicking cars. Now 23 and unemployed, he hadn't told Raleigh the real reason why he wanted to come. </p> <p>Some bloke in Newcastle, he said, had asked him to deliver a package to Manchester and Dave, foolishly, had opened it and then even more foolishly substituted something. \"They\" were after him big-time, he said. Dave was on the run and the safest place in the world for him was among the glaciers and the international kids. </p> <p>Where most of the other venturers came from middle-class homes, were straight out of school and the pony club or doing a gap year before or after university, he was tough as nails. He felt an academic and social oddball but as the weeks went on he joined in the Cilla Black impersonations, learned to like - if not love - the daily porridge and sardines, and opened up to the madcap enthusiasm. Between the real physical adventures and the campfire culture, he was haunted about what would happen when he got back. \"Maybe I'll just carry on travelling,\" he said. \"I could go on to America, anywhere. It's OK for most of these people. The trouble is that I can't hide.\" </p> <p>Dave could scarcely believe how sheltered, naive or plain ignorant the majority of the British venturers were. Some had worked hard to raise the \u00a34,000 needed to come, but others had raised the cash in a single party for friends or, like Prince William, had got help from Dad. Some had never left home, or even camped before, others were more at home on a pony or in a lecture hall. Some were public school high-fliers being sponsored by international companies and were trying to advance their carers, yet others saw themselves at personal crossroads - trying to decide what to do or wanting to get out of boring jobs, or relationships. </p> <p>But boy, did they have a good time. Halfway into the 10 weeks almost everyone testified to being happier than ever before. Many had amazed themselves at what they had done. Kayaking through ice flows and camping above the snowline, climbing around glaciers, walking 30 miles a day and making snow shelters and skimming over lagoons in inflatables had stretched most of them. All had caught the adventure bug, and with many of the hunky or horsey volunteer minders falling in love with each other, it made for a heady brew. \"It was like being on another planet\", said Martin, a 20-year-old from Kent. </p> <p>\"It was a seminal period of my life,\" says Kirsty Monro from Ilkley in Yorkshire, who was in Chile in 1993. Now an artist living in Majorca, she says: \"I'd repeat it a million times. You're put out of real life into a wilderness. You learn about yourself, your limits, you find out your abilities. Some people had never left home. You learn how to be with people. I felt like I lived a million lives in months.\" </p> <p>Monro recognised she was lucky finding a group of friends who are still with her seven years on. \"Some groups who go on a Raleigh expedition just don't mix. Some people have a miserable time, some get stuck with people they cannot stand. People had tantrums. It was a lottery.\" </p> <p>Raleigh takes about 1,000 17 to 25 year olds on 10 expeditions a year. When Prince Charles started it in 1978, it was run by the eccentric Colonel Blashford-Snell on strict military lines and was shamelessly adventure-oriented. Now led by Jamie Robertson-Macleod, a former Green Jacket captain and equerry to Prince Rainier of Monaco, it is billed as an international development charity and emphasises the environmental and social works the youths are expected to do. </p> <p>If anything, it has become more establishment, a youth wing of the diplomatic corps and a recruiting ground for the British army. Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe and others have attested in parliament to the \"real benefits for UK foreign policy\" that volunteering of this kind can bring. </p> <p>Raleigh gets much of its money from the government via the Darwin Initiative, UN bodies, the European commission, and everyone from the Lions Club to the Freemasons of Yorkshire. Its main \"sponsor\" in the past decade has been Inchcape, the world's largest distributor of cars. It draws heavily on former armed service personnel and recruits many of its volunteer helpers from the SAS and civil service with the Ministry of Defence sponsoring some venturers. It tends to take its expeditions to countries which Britain likes to do lucrative arms business with, many of which have or have known dictatorships. In the past few years, it has been to Indonesia, Oman, Brunei, Namibia, and Angola. </p> <p>Last year it was linked more formally to the army who will from now on fund 20 places a year for \"at risk, disadvantaged\" children, such as Dave, in return for \"helping the army raise awareness of its career opportunities among Raleigh participants\". </p> <p>The new internationalism which it espouses, tries to marry British interests abroad with personal development and good works for the needy. Wherever Raleigh goes, it is feted by embassies and local politicians. In Chile, General Pinochet just happened to land on the glacier in a helicopter as Dave and the venturers were heading that way. Prince Charles himself dropped in on one Oman group last year. The Sultan of Brunei is an admirer, as are other heads of state. Says Robertson-Macleod: \"People say that we are ambassadors.\" </p> <p>For the venturers who tend to stick to their social strata, it can be one long diplomatic party. One group in Oman, dubbed the \"dinner party set\", reported that it had found time to do its own own entertaining, go to the horse races and concerts, and be entertained by in the British embassy. </p> <p>But Raleigh International's semi-diplomatic status is also one of its problems. All the social and environmental work done by the venturers is with the guidance of the local min istries who are often out of contact themselves with the needs of local people. The locals often respond to the arrival of gangs of whites with a mixture of bemusement and semi-resentment. </p> <p>Raleigh volunteers were recently sent to Mount Elgon national park in Uganda to build a camping lodge for tourists. The report from the locals was not complimentary: \"The major criticism of the present development strategy [in the park] is the use of Raleigh International in the construction of tourist facilities. The applicability of a group of 12 European office workers for five weeks to build a campsite is questionable with regards sustainability. This phenomenon could be termed aid tourism, the desire of westerners to do charitable work in the developing world, with personal development a primary objective. </p> <p>\"The work of Raleigh expeditions may be of value to the nation, but as a group they are misunderstood by the local communities. Rather than assisting development they are viewed as actively taking work away from the locals. One venturer suggested that the guides and porters could organise themselves into an association and, among other activities, carry out the work their expedition was completing,\" said one member of the park staff. </p> <p>In Chile, the task for one group while I was there was to rebuild a barn which had been destroyed several years previously following a volcanic eruption. The local farmer had provided new beech shingles tiles and watched in amazement as 25 peo ple with no knowledge of carpentry or roofing proceeded to botch the job in record time. It would be a miracle if that barn is still standing today. </p> <p>Robertson-Macleod says that the number of complaints Raleigh has today is \"far fewer\" than seven years ago. He admits that in the early days Raleigh was often not sophisticated. \"We know we have a lot to learn. We don't want to be building things that are not needed. We need community interaction. People are generally very happy with our work. On an average expedition to Africa now, 30% of the venturers are from the host country. We are not telling people what they should do. The idea of venturers being patronising or colonial is just wrong.\" </p> <p>Most of the work building schools, dams, or old people's homes, helping local or British scientists, he says, would not be done were it not for Raleigh. Nevertheless, the venturers I was with were given no briefing of the politics of the country, no overview of the wider social or physical environment and no expectation was made of them to learn the local languages. </p> <p>Prince William has now arrived in Patagonia and, says Robertson Macleod, there are \"amazing\" stories coming back of how well the expedition is going - which he will not share because St James's palace would \"skin\" him. What happens when the prince returns will be another matter: many of the venturers say they find it hard to readjust. Many change jobs and lifestyles. </p> <p>For Dave, it didn't work out too well. He was last heard of in trouble with the police. For Prince William, the next 10 weeks will be reality suspended, a mix of sheer bliss, utter terror at the physical extremes and, just like Dave, a very uncertain homecoming.</p>"
