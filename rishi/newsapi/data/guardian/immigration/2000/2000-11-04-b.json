  "<p>Welcome to the global dance. It started in the late 1980s with Acid House - a simple, hypnotic brand of electronic dance music formed in the underground gay discos of New York, Chicago and Detroit, mixed up with trashy Euro disco on the dancefloors of Ibiza and often enjoyed alongside a new designer drug called Ecstasy. London and Manchester were the first British cities to succumb to it, but nothing this good could stay secret for long: by 1990, there was at least one big dance club in every town in the UK, and the culture was spreading all over the world. </p> <p>Once, only weird kids wanted to dress up and dance all night - now this kind of clubbing is a mainstream leisure activity everywhere: from Tokyo to Telford, Birmingham to Bali. And it shows no sign of ending. The music has evolved, adapted, spun off into endless confusing categories and sub-groups, but the basic premise stays the same: repetitive electronic beats, big smiles, and huge crowds giving it lots of hands-in-the-air abandon. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the clubs have got bigger, boasting massive sound systems and extravagant decor that will shock those of you whose last dance experience was a chrome disco with swirly carpets, a few flashing lights and a mirror ball. </p> <p>In the past decade, major British clubs such as Ministry of Sound, Cream and Gatecrasher have become international youth culture brands, big businesses selling CDs, magazines and clothes and organising parties all over the globe. Our star DJs earn more in one night than some of us do in a year, leading a life many jet-setters would envy: summers in Ibiza or Ayia Napa, winters playing clubs in Australia, South America or South Africa, and regular monthly gigs in New York clubs. </p> <p>The scene is now a huge global business with its own stars, its own social calendar with regular annual fixtures such as the gay mardi gras in Sydney, the Love Parade in Berlin, and the Miami Winter Music conference. It has also bred a whole new kind of tourism - clubbers who travel the world less to see the sights than to experience the nights. This is a guide to some of the club capitals of the world, but search in any big city and you'll find something similar. As the record says, \"Let the music take control.\" </p> <p><strong>Berlin</strong></p> <p>\"Berlin is such a great clubbing city because there has always been an interesting mix of clubbers and music since the East and West joined together\"<br><strong> DJ Paul Van Dyk</strong> </p> <p><strong> Local DJs </strong> Westbam, Sven Vath, Paul Van Dyk, Timo Maas, Jazzanova.<br><strong> UK/American DJs </strong> Carl Cox, Jeff Mills, Derrick Carter and any of the big Techno names. </p> <p><strong> Icon</strong> Cantian Strasse 15 / Mila Strasse<br>Door: Dm10, Dm20 for special events <br> Housed in a building that used to be a brewery, this is the oldest Drum 'n' Bass venue in the city and has played host to famous DJs such as Grooverider, Peshay,and Doc Scott. </p> <p><strong> Rive Gauche</strong> Friedrichstrasse 105 <br> Door: Dm 20 (weekends &amp; Special events), Dm10 (Thursdays, when they have an after-work night) <br>Mainly populated by people in advertising, party people.

  "<p> Jack Nicholson once described her as a cross between a fawn and a Buick. And it is true that, though petite, Jessica Lange has an unexpectedly powerful physique. She looks strong, sexy, and her skin glows with good health. She has a vibrant presence, though there is little of the glitz of Hollywood about her apart from a slightly starry self-consciousness. For Lange is the product of the landscape into which she was born and to which she has returned to raise her own family. Minnesota. A state as far north as you can go before America turns into Canada, a land of dense forests in the north and wild, bleak prairies in the south; harsh winters, a hardy population, many of whose jobs rely on the massive iron ore deposits below the surface. She has come to London to star in a West End production of the great American classic, Long Day's Journey Into Night, Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical portrait of a family in crisis. She is playing the part of Mary Tyrone, a woman in painful decline as her family disintegrates into physical and spiritual ruin around her. One of Lange's directors once observed that she is \"drawn to grief\" like a moth to a flame. O'Neill's masterpiece is, as he writes in a tender dedication to his wife Carlotta, \"a play of old sorrow, written in tears and blood\". It is perfect Lange territory, and she admits the role was irresistible.</p> <p> \"Mary . . . Mary just breaks my heart, you know? I'm always drawn to those kind of characters. I love . . . I mean, I love the sadness in her, I love the loneliness, the fear she has.\" Why should that be? \"I think mostly because they are the areas that touch me most deeply and the ones that I'm most interested in exploring, you know? That kind of shadow. The dark side of a character.</p> <p>I mean, it's always been that way and I don't know why. It's just something that, uh, interests me more than a character that doesn't have those ghosts.\"</p> <p>Lange, who has talked in the past about suffering periods of depression, once said she thought her interest in the tragic, the sad and the lonely came from growing up in the woods of Minnesota. \"Maybe growing up there instils a sense of loneliness and despair in you and conditions the things that move you. Maybe it just comes out of the earth up there. It's something that envelops you.\" Maybe they're just better roles.</p> <p> We meet to discuss her latest venture in a small Italian restaurant behind Waterloo station. It is day five of rehearsals. She met her co-stars for the first time on Monday. She is to play opposite Charles Dance who appears as James Tyrone, Mary's flawed actor husband. So far, things are going well. \"This, for me, is the most exciting part, really,\" she says in her easy drawl. \"The kind of first encounters, and listening to the other voices and trying to figure out how it's all going to kind of mesh together. I mean, we're really just in the first process of discovery. Really hearing it and trying to figure out the thought behind everything, you know? I love that part of it. So I figure this week and the next couple of weeks will be the most thrilling in a way.\" It is a welcome return to the West End for Lange. She was last here four years ago as Blanche DuBois in Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, when she was given an enthusiastic reception by critics and public alike. Like Long Day's Journey Into Night, it was produced by Bill Kenwright and it restored Lange's stage reputation after a less triumphant run in the same role on Broadway in 1992, when critics commented on her \"lack of stage technique, including a voice that is not always audible\" and an \"emotional timidity\", which hardly seems credible in the context of her powerfully emotional film roles. </p> <p>Given Lange's lack of stage experience - her theatre work is limited to her very early career when she was studying acting in New York - it was a bold step to appear on Broadway, in one of the greatest plays ever written by an American. The role of Mary Tyrone is no less ambitious and there are those who are interested to see how the earthy, sexy, physically powerful Jessica Lange will fare as Mary, an ethereal, fragile character who floats in and out of the action, increasingly doped up on morphine. </p> <p>Her appearance at the Lyric Theatre is the latest in a long line of Hollywood imports to London's West End in recent years. Kathleen Turner (The Graduate), Nicole Kidman (The Blue Room), Kevin Spacey (The Ice Man Cometh) and, most recently, Daryl Hannah (The Seven Year Itch) and Macaulay Culkin (Madame Melville). It's a trend that serves a number of purposes; a big name can certainly work wonders for a show's success at the box office; equally, it can also be used to boost a flagging film career. The casting can look gimmicky, opportunistic, though not so in this case. Lange in the role of Mary Tyrone is an enticing prospect for London's theatre critics. </p> <p>She is not particularly nervous about the venture, despite her relative lack of stage experience. Does she think she's a better film actor than stage? \"I've done so much more film than theatre. I don't know,\" she says.</p> <p>\"I wouldn't know how to judge myself. I mean, after doing 22 films, you begin to understand the craft.</p> <p>\"I remember when I was working with [Jack] Nicholson years ago, I mean, it was uncanny his awareness of the camera and how everything was geared toward that, you know? I think that's what a great film actor knows how to do. Make the camera interested, make the camera want to see more. You know, really make the camera move in on you in a way, to study what it is that's going on.\"</p> <p>That surely is what Lange is so good at, too. As the murderous Cora in The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981), she and Nicholson battle it out for the camera's attention. It's a pretty close run thing. Or as the doomed actress Frances Farmer in Frances (1982); or the tragic country singer Patsy Cline in Sweet Dreams (1985). Lange seizes the camera's attention and holds on to it with both of her tough little hands, her teeth gritted with effort.</p> <p>These are among her best roles - no coincidence, perhaps, given her interest in the dark side of a character. Others have worked less well. On one of the dozens of Jessica Lange websites, a fan called Rebecca poses a conundrum familiar to anyone who has a passing interest in her work. \"Jessica Lange is my favourite actress,\" writes Rebecca, \"but she does seem to make movies that barely get seen or, if they do, are not very good.\" And there's something in that. Lange is revered as one of Hollywood's most talented and intelligent stars - but in among some truly memorable performances there have been some surprisingly poor choices. </p> <p>Lange's private life may now have settled (she is married to Pulitzer prize-winning writer, director and actor Sam Shepard), but professionally it never has, which is perhaps part of its fascination. There was Tootsie (1982), for which she won an Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as the sweeter-than-candy soap star with whom Dustin Hoffman's character falls in love. Then there was Country (1984), Sweet Dreams (1985), The Music Box (1989), Cape Fear (1991) and Blue Sky (1994), for which she won an Oscar for best actress for her role as the beleaguered military wife of Tommy Lee Jones. But along the way there have also been films ranging from the forgettable, such as Far North (1988), to the absolutely dire, such as Hush (1998). </p> <p>Jessica Lange was born in the small town of Cloquet, Minnesota, the third of four children to Al and Dorothy Lange. Al Lange was a wanderer, a drinker, a dreamer who did a variety of jobs throughout his life, everything from railroad worker to salesman, repeatedly uprooting and moving his family. He was a powerful, charismatic personality - not an easy man. His famous daughter loved him and hated him, but she always needed his approval. When she was a baby, so the story goes, he tossed her off a pier to teach her how to swim. When it came to teaching her to ride, he just put her on the back of a wild pony. </p> <p>Lange seems attracted to powerful, charismatic characters. After school, she got a scholarship to Minneapolis University to study art, where she became a hippy princess - beaded, beautiful, barefoot - but dropped out and went off to see the world with one of her teachers, a Spanish photographer and film-maker called Paco Grande, whom she married. They lived in bohemian New York, then moved to Europe, where they lived with the Gypsies in Spain, following the flamenco fairs in Seville and around Andalusia. From there they went to Amsterdam and on to Paris, where Lange studied mime and lived through the 1968 student revolution. They existed on next to nothing and travelled on a motorbike - the sort of existence most of us dream about as teenagers but few realise. </p> <p>The marriage, however, broke down. Lange returned to America, where she was signed up by Wilhemina, one of the leading model agencies of the day. She claims she was never quite tall enough or thin enough to make it on the catwalk; she did a couple of department store catalogues, but her break into films came when she was cast in the 1976 Dino de Laurentiis remake of King Kong as the ape's love interest. </p> <p>It was a disaster. Lange was lambasted and she didn't appear in a film again for three years. Her next appearance was as the angel of death in All That Jazz (1979), which was directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse, with whom she had an affair. It wasn't until 1981 that she got her big break in Bob Rafelson's The Postman Always Rings Twice, where she excelled as a duplicitous murderess. Nicholson, her co-star, idolised her. \"Few are the men who do not want to fall at the feet of Jessica Lange,\" he said. </p> <p>Her life has been as interesting off screen as on. She once said a quest for intensity had plagued her romantic life. \"It was a trap for me. As long as it was passionate - either negative or positive - then I knew it was love. As long as it was extreme. That was its validity. As soon as anything became too settled, too regular, too placid, I'd have to get in there with the Mixmaster to make sure things were still cooking.\" </p> <p>She embarked on a relationship with Russian dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, with whom she has one daughter. Then, on the set of Frances, she met Shepard, who had a similarly colourful past and with whom she still lives. Lange is probably the better known of the two - just - but Shepard is recognised, in particular, as one of America's leading playwrights. </p> <p>Lange is notoriously reticent about their relationship as a \"movie couple\". When she picked up the best actress Oscar for Blue Sky, Shepard did not accompany her to the ceremony and she did not mention him in her acceptance speech, which provoked comment. But, as she later pointed out, award ceremonies are not his cup of tea, and her life with Shepard is separate from her professional life. Except that is, of course, when they work together. After Frances, they starred in Country and Crimes Of The Heart (1986) together. He also directed her in Far North, which he wrote, drawing on her childhood in Minnesota. She clearly enjoys working with him - they share a passion for the land and she has said that Far North and Crimes Of The Heart were among the most fun to make of all her films. </p> <p> \"As far as Sam and I are concerned, yes, we're both very private people. We just have to guard against becoming so reclusive that we end up like two old hermits living up on top of this hill,\" she was once quoted as saying.</p> <p>There does seem to be an unlikely quaintness about their relationship. Back in 1985, a journalist from the International Herald Tribune interviewing Lange described how Shepard walked in unexpectedly; Lange leaped to his side in mid-sentence as though she had not set eyes on him for weeks. She once said she had made a life-long commitment to \"taking care of Sam\". </p> <p> At 51, she is now relaxed about her career. \"I don't have a tremendous amount of ambition left.\" Was she ever that ambitious? \"Oh yeah, I think so, in the beginning. Of course, not a kind of a killer ambition by any stretch of the imagination. But I'm not looking for anything that way any more, I don't think. In the beginning, you're searching for some kind of recognition. And after a certain amount of time, that's really not important any more.\"</p> <p>Her children and family life had a dramatic impact on her career - she loathes being parted from them for any length of time. She has three children; a 19-year-old daughter, Alexandra, who is known as Shura, from her seven-year relationship with Baryshnikov; and Hannah, 14, and Walker, 13, from her relationship with Shepard. All of them will be coming to London to spend varying amounts of time with her while she's doing the play. </p> <p>They will be tutored while they are here, and they will grumble and moan that they are having to leave behind their friends and their lives back home in Minnesota, but Lange has always made sure her children spend plenty of time with her when she's away on location - not just for them. When they were smaller, she says she used to be able to just pack them up and bring them away and they were barely aware of where they were. It was much easier. Now they'd prefer to be left at home, but she can't do it. Why not? \"Because I don't do well without them.\" </p> <p>Ask her what it feels like to be without them and she pauses for a second, then says: \"You know what it feels like? It feels like the end of the world. They're the only thing I think in my life that ever really anchored me, that I've ever felt cemented to. And I just enjoy them more than anyone else in the world. And I'd rather hang out with them than anyone else. I'd rather be with them than with anyone else. I find them infinitely fascinating.\" </p> <p> Lange is refreshingly independent of Hollywood. She has spoken out occasionally - challenging the absurd sums the big stars command for each performance. She has said she would never have plastic surgery - even if she did add that Sam would not approve. She's physically separate from the place - as well as ideologically - never having lived there.</p> <p>Until 1995 she lived in Charlottesville, Virginia, on a farm where Shepard bred horses and raised cattle. Then, when her widowed mother's health began to fail, she took her family back to Minnesota, so that they could grow up amid a network of cousins and second cousins, brothers and sisters, uncles, aunts, great uncles and great aunts. She wanted her children to feel haunted by a place, the way she was as a child, with a powerful sense of belonging. She once said that she would like her gravestone to be inscribed with just one word, \"Mother\".</p> <p>Seven years ago, she was one of a group who travelled to Romania to try to help free children from the nightmarish institutions of the Ceausescu regime. She brought back two children - a boy and a girl. The boy went to live with one family, the little girl stayed with Lange. When she arrived, they thought she was about two years old. It turned out she was in fact six but her muscles had atrophied to such a degree that she had not grown. She had never walked; she had never talked. \"There was this thrilling moment when she started to walk. She got strong and she got healthy,\" says Lange. She never, sadly, learned to talk.</p> <p>After 18 months the girl went to live with the family who were bringing up the Romanian boy brought out of the country at the same time. \"It was not a question of adopting her, it was a question of getting her out and finding her a home and getting her healthy before she went to live with these people. If I had the kind of stability, I would have loved to bring these children up. It was very difficult because of the way I work. I'm always travelling. I'm always going on location. These kids really needed a place where they were just at home. They had never had that.\" </p> <p>Currently, her key preoccupation is the American elections. She is watching the presidential race anxiously from afar. Before coming to London she was heavily involved in campaigning for the Democrats - because the alternative, she believes, would be so disastrous for her country, particularly on abortion rights. Bush is pro-life.</p> <p>She's also concerned about the environment. Bush's record on environmental policies in Texas, where he is governor, she says, are some of the worst in the entire country. \"We are going backward in that country at such an alarming rate, it's really scary. We have this incredible kind of, um, conservative right-wing movement, and if Bush gets elected, it's going to move so far right. I told my kids, 'Look, if Bush is elected, think of where you wanna go. [She laughs - a really funny, infectious laugh.] We'll be leaving for four years.\"</p> <p>Seriously? \"Nooooo, I can't drag my kids out of the country just because I hate the president, although I would be tempted. [She laughs again.] You know, to see his smirking little face on TV every night, and to listen to him - he's such a stupid man. </p> <p>\"They're saying this is the closest election in something like, what, 40 years? That's what's so frightening. You look at the people around you and you think, 'My God, what are you thinking about? There is no contest here. What are you thinking about?'\"</p> <p>She thinks Clinton has been \"a very successful president\", but adds, \"For a man who is so amazingly intelligent, he really has done some extraordinary things. Sometimes you just have to shake your head and think, how could he be so fucking stupid, you know? How could he have blown it like this? The whole scandals! We've been continually hounded by these scandals for the last eight years.\"</p> <p>Lange is more engaged politically than I anticipated. Hollywood has a long and enduring relationship with politics - Warren Beatty, Ronald Reagan, Clint Eastwood, Jane Fonda - but Lange is less known as an activist; someone who is private, cut off, busy living out a rural idyll, doing a bit of photography, \"taking care\" of Sam. We talk about the excitement of 1968 and I ask her what she thinks about the anti-globalism protests which have recently taken place in Prague and, before that, in Seattle. \"It interests me a great deal. I mean, I think it's very dangerous to have the World Trade Organisation making decisions. It's hard enough for people to actually get the government to do what they want. But to have something that's so outside any kind of rules and checks. That I think is very frightening.\" </p> <p> She says she was much more political in the 60s, when an entire generation was galvanised into political action by the Vietnam War, but every once in a while it rears its head again. Like when she, Sissy Spacek and Jane Fonda travelled to Washington to give evidence before something called the House Democratic Caucus Task Force on Agriculture in order to highlight the plight of farmers being driven off the land. News reports from the time document that Fonda was the most professional, Spacek the most impassioned and Lange the most heartfelt. </p> <p>It is an issue about which Lange feels particularly strongly because of her own upbringing amid farmers in Minnesota. She cares about the land and those who work on it and you can see it in her work, most evidently in Country, which she produced and in which she plays a farmer's wife struggling to hold farm and family together in the face of ruinous Reaganite policies. It's there in A Thousand Acres (1997), a reworking of King Lear in which a father seeks to divide his farmland among his daughters. There's a campaigning edge to some of her work, which isn't instantly obvious.</p> <p>Would she call herself a feminist? \"No, I would never say that. No, I would never use that term. I've always done what I've wanted. I've never felt anything has stood in my way. I think I've raised my daughters that same way, that they are capable of doing anything they could possibly ever imagine.\" </p> <p>After Long Day's Journey, Lange's next leap into the dark comes when she directs for the first time. She first optioned the novel Machine Dreams, by Jayne Anne Phillips, 15 years ago, and after leaving it gathering dust for years, she returned to it last winter and wrote a draft script. \"The writing was very enjoyable,\" she says. \"There are very few things in my life which I do privately. You know what I mean? Where you are actually alone in a room and it's just you. It was very meditative, very peaceful. It was wonderful to sit on winter afternoons and try to adapt this book.\" </p> <p>Did she feel at all intimidated, tiptoeing as she was into Shepard's territory as writer? \"No, actually,\" she says breezily. \"It didn't intimidate me while I was doing it at all. When I gave him the script to read, I think I hovered nervously around the stairwell to see how he was going to react,\" she says. \"But he was really great about it.\"</p> <p>Writing is not something she finds particularly easy. \"I don't have the discipline to do it. I really don't. I have a hard time just settling in one spot for more than a few moments at a time.\" Directing, however, is another matter. She is very excited about directing. Kathy Bates and Robin Wright have already expressed an interest in the project and once she has got her next film out of the way (she is starring with Christina Ricci in Elizabeth Wurtzel's Prozac Nation) she'll move to the other side of the camera. \"I'm going to ask everybody I've ever known who's directed anything at all - even traffic - I'm going to ask them how it's done, you know? I have no ego when it comes to that. I want everybody's, everybody's information.\" </p> <p>Heartfelt. Yes, that's it. Lange is someone whose politics, like her career and her private life, is heartfelt. She's driven by her heart and by her emotions; she's constantly getting out the Mixmaster to make sure things are still cooking. Which doesn't always make for sensible decisions, but it does make her daring, and a bit dangerous and at times dazzling. She might bomb, she might be brilliant, but at least she doesn't play it safe</p> <p>Long Day's Journey Into Night will be previewing at the Lyric Theatre, London, from November 6 and runs until March 3.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Artist:</strong> Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault (1791-1824), the despairing Romantic artist whose tortured personal life (he had an affair with his aunt) and his taste for the morbid bore strange fruit in The Raft of the Medusa (1819) - a horrifying large-scale painting of the survivors of a French maritime disaster, seen as an image of national corruption. </p> <p><strong>Subject: </strong> An inmate of the asylum at Ivry, where G\u00e9ricault was invited by his friend Dr Etienne-Jean Georget to paint portraits of those suffering from various \"monomanias\". The five surviving paintings, from what was reportedly a series of 10, include a kleptomaniac, a woman with a mania for gambling, a military obsessive and a victim of envy. </p> <p><strong>Distinguishing features: </strong> This man looks desolate, isolated in the darkness, his eyes wandering to the side, his dishevelled brown clothes announcing his indifference. This is a painting of a man cut adrift from his moorings, stranded in a drab, featureless place, not just the shadow world of the asylum but a twilight zone on the edge of human society. G\u00e9ricault does not paint him as an object of study, although this was what he was asked to do by Georget, who believed it was possible to read the symptoms of mental illness in a face. Georget's physiognomic analyses of monomanias, as described in his book De la Folie (1820), shape this painting; today, a doctor could read the shifty sideways look and haggard, thin face as signs of mania. But it's impossible to see this painting as a cold, clinical study. It is an act of Romantic sympathy. </p> <p>Would you recognise it, without the title, as a study of madness - of paedophilia? It is an examination of suffering. It is also a dramatisation of a face as flesh, as physical matter. G\u00e9ricault spent a formative period of study in Italy where he was transfixed by the way Michelangelo gave life to sculpted bodies. G\u00e9ricault's paintings animate flesh with singular vividness. This painting pays meticulous attention to the fabric of the flesh. You can feel the man's bone structure, imagine the shape of his skull. He is like a forensic reconstruction of a head, yet living. In this sense, G\u00e9ricault's painting perfectly does its work as a record of a disordered physiognomy: it is the mask of disease. </p> <p>G\u00e9ricault's masterpiece The Raft of the Medusa was itself a picture of a world gone mad. The naked, dead and dying people clustered desperately on a platform of timbers lashed together against the swelling sea have been driven insane. When the Medusa, a ship carrying French colonists to Senegal, sank off west Africa in 1816, only 15 of the 150 people survived, on a raft; they were driven to cannibalism and became pariahs, outcast from civilisation. G\u00e9ricault's child-kidnapper is as desolate and bereft as those survivors. He is a man who has no \"right\" to have a portrait made, a man utterly removed from the respectable world set in oils by the portrait painters of G\u00e9ricault's day - Ingres in France, Thomas Lawrence in Britain. </p> <p>This portrait hits a raw nerve today. Its assertion that deviant desires are betrayed by the face might appeal to many who wonder how to identify the monster in our midst. What is more challenging is G\u00e9ricault's compassion for this man. </p> <p><strong>Inspirations and influences: </strong> In the Romantic era the figure who was most often portrayed (and self-portrayed) as mad was the artist. In 1815 Goya depicted himself isolated and melancholic in darkness, just like this man. The romantic identification of art and insanity is most succinct in Van Gogh's Self-Portrait With Bandaged Ear (1889). </p> <p><strong> Where is it? </strong> In the Spectacular Bodies exhibition at the Hayward Gallery, London SE1 (020- 7928 3144), until January 14.</p>",
  "<p>The rivalry between those who choose \"planks\" (skis) and those who prefer \"trays\" (snowboards) is well-documented. As a lifelong skier who decided to learn snowboarding 10 years ago, I feel anyone who doesn't do a bit of both is missing out. But not everyone has the time to learn both modes, so which one to go for? Here's a run through of the pros and cons. </p> <p><strong> Ease of learning</strong></p> <p><strong>Skiing: </strong>The initial learning curve is pretty fast. The most natural mode of transport we ever learn, walking, involves independent leg movement. So does skiing. Once you've got the hang of the snowplough turn, usually on the first or second day, you're capable of skiing around the whole mountain, as long as it's not too steep. Even parallel turns usually come fairly quickly.But the problem with skiing is that it's too easy to get away with doing it badly. </p> <p>You can spend all your life making turns on blue and red runs by rotating your whole body, but as soon as you get on to steeper slopes, you'll get \"found out\". You will only master bumpis and off-piste with style when you learn to pivot your feet beneath you while keeping your upper body still and facing down the slope. </p> <p><strong>Snowboarding: </strong>Anyone who has done it will tell you that learning to snowboard is a long and bruising process at first, only to be undertaken when the snow is soft. Imagine learning to windsurf with out the water! For me it was humbling: even after three days, it took me half an hour to ride down a run that I could ski down in around two minutes. </p> <p>As a skier, I felt very constricted having both feet clamped together, but I imagine that that feels unnatural for most people. There's almost no other activity where it is necessary - even skateboarders and surfers can move their feet a bit. And in snowboarding, there are two totally different types of turn to learn: backside (edging with your heels) and frontside (edging with your toes). </p> <p>Like most skiers, I found the backside turn easier at first (at least your toes are pointing roughly where you're going), and the frontside utterly alien. But, ironically, once you've picked up the frontside turn, you'll find it's the more stable and natural movement. It has been found that some skiers learn snowboarding quicker if they are given a pair of ski poles for balance. </p> <p>Soon after learning to snowboard on piste, you can try going off-piste. It will be a revelation - you'll realise that all the pain and anguish was worth it. Snowboarding in powder is virtually easier than doing it on piste, and is one of the greatest sensations known to humankind. Young snowboarders will also soon progress to taking air in the terrain park and halfpipe. But only the most masochistic will ever try to manoeuvre a snowboard through a mogulfield. </p> <p><strong>Convenience</strong> </p> <p><strong>Skiing: </strong>Of course, the worst part is walking to the lifts, clumping along with your ski boots open, dropping skis, poles, gloves and goggles as you go. You try to look cool with your skis on your shoulder, just like your instructor, but they keep slipping apart, and anyway they hurt your collarbone. But once you're on the mountain, you're in your element. Chairlifts present no problem, and once you've got the hang of T-bars and Poma lifts, they're fairly comfortable to ride. </p> <p><strong>Snowboarding: </strong>Walking through the car park, you're the coolest of dudes. In your comfy soft boots you can saunter past the clumping skiers, snowboard nonchalantly tucked under one arm. But on the mountain, a snowboard is not the best-thought-out method of getting around. </p> <p>To ride any lift, you have to remove your back foot. Step-in bindings have made this easier, but most of them still keep clogging up with ice. At the top of every lift you increase your risk of haemorrhoids, sitting in the snow as you struggle to strap your back foot in again. T-bars and Poma lifts are, literally, a pain in the groin. And when you encounter the dreaded flat sections, you have four options: take the back foot out and \"scoot\"; bend down and claw yourself along with your fingernails; hop like a demented frog; or beg your skiing mates for a tow. </p> <p><strong>Pose factor</strong> </p> <p><strong>Skiing: </strong> At the moment, skintight suits are just not \"in\". Ski-racers need to wear them for aerodynamics, but most other young skiers have adopted fairly baggy gear. The \"New School freeriders\", acrobats who are inventing new skiing tricks based upon snowboarding, would not be seen dead in anything that isn't baggy. </p> <p><strong>Snowboarding: </strong>You may think those young whippersnappers in the terrain park look pretty scruffy, in their baggy, drab-coloured gear. But they have spent good money to achieve that look. The snowboards themselves should have fairly subdued, retro graphics (no palm trees, motorbikes or naked women nowadays, thank you very much). </p> <p><strong>The lingo</strong> </p> <p><strong>Skiing: </strong>Has always been a source of techno-head jargon, and you'll still encounter plenty of that, especially with the current breakneck pace of ski development: torsional rigidity, sidecut dimensions, taper angle, ramp angle, alignment, vibration dampening, multi-injection, lateral transmission, dualtec, prolink, beta profile, monocoque, energy frame. The list is endless, and that's before you've even left the shop. Once you're on the mountain, there's plenty more: initiation, angulation, anticipation, upper-lower body separation, rise line, zipper line... </p> <p>But to be fair, these terms are sometimes coined by technicians or instructors to encapsulate a complicated concept, which would otherwise require many more words to describe. </p> <p><strong>Snowboarding: </strong>Has adopted Californian surfer slang, and added a few terms of its own. If something is extremely tough, it's \"gnarly\", \"sick\", or \"rad\". To describe something especially good, the epithets \"wicked\", \"bad\", or \"dope\". </p> <p>Of course, these words may already have been superseded by even newer ones. But when referring to the sideways-standing sport, whatever you do, don't ever call it \"boarding\" - real snowboarders hate that word; it's either \"snowboarding\", or \"riding\". </p> <p><strong>The injuries</strong> </p> <p><strong>Skiing: </strong>No longer lives up to its \"break a leg\" reputation, but still keeps plenty of knee surgeons in golf-club fees, mainly due to the ubiquitous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures. In addition, upper body and head injuries, caused by collisions with other piste users or trees, are increasing as pistes get busier and better equipment makes people ski more confidently - and faster. </p> <p><strong>Snowboarding: </strong>Much safer for leg injuries, although the ankles sometimes suffer. But upper body injuries are frequent. If you stack on the frontside, you may break your wrist or collarbone. If you slam backwards, your coxyx (\"tailbone\") could snap. </p> <p><strong>Avalanche danger</strong></p> <p><strong>Skiing: </strong>The media coverage of freeride events is motivating more skiers to go off-piste. Even in the (relatively) safety of North America, more skiers are choosing to exit the ski areas through the backcountry gates, and take their chances. </p> <p><strong>Snowboarding: </strong>For many years, snowboarders were the avalanche bogeymen. There is no doubt that snowboards make it easy for inexperienced riders to go off-piste, with little experience or mountain savvy. It's all a matter of education, and there are now special signs on the slopes in Austria, bearing the slogan: \"It's not cool to kill friends\".</p>",
  "<p>As seems appropriate, the new culinary millennium opened with a clash of batterie de cuisine in the daily press, with Delia Smith and Antony Worral Thompson going at it for all they're worth, which is considerable. The path to television is paved with gold as far as many cooks are concerned. Whether this public display actually is symptomatic of a dumbing down of our culinary culture is open to debate. What is beyond question is that it is indicative of massive social change.</p> <p> Look back 50 years and you find a Britain limping painfully out of the wartime economy, still shrouded in rationing, still shuddering at the memory of Woolton pie, snoek and the Monday jug. Tea rationing ended in 1952, sugar, eggs and sweets rationing in 1953, and cheese and meat rationing in 1954. Expectations were, from the perspective of today, painfully restricted. Ingredients, dishes and cooking techniques still took the prewar standards as their model. Yet the forces which were to bring about the changes in what we eat and the way we eat it were already at work.</p> <p> The war brought about the most radical democratisation of society this country has ever undergone. Granted, there is still a way to go before all sense of class is eliminated. Nevertheless, wartime experience of deprivation, diet and death encompassed all classes, and government-controlled, centralised food production and distribution meant that the nation's diet was pretty much uniform. </p> <p> The war also released women from the absolute tyranny of domestic life. The experience of working beside men at the front line, on the land and in offices and factories opened women's eyes to the possibility that it need not be their lot to be tied to the kitchen and the cot for ever. Initially Britain returned to its prewar culinary habits. Margaret Patten, the dame and doyenne of wartime cookery writers, lists the following dishes in A Century of British Cooking as typical of the decade between 1950 and 1960: cock-a-leekie, calves's liver pate, tournedos Rossini, steak Diane, quiche Lorraine, crepes Suzettes, apple strudel and baked Alaska.</p> <p> Compare those to a selection taken at random from restaurant menus and cook books produced over the last 12 months: Sicilian Baked Courgette with orange, pine nuts and herbs; laksa with coriander crusted chicken; pork dumplings in lime-leaf broth; wild mushroom risotto with a cappucino of ceps; salmon with crisp chilli salad; fillet of hake with clams and chorizo; bitter orange parfait with mascarpone and candied orange. One thing clearly differentiates the two eras, quite apart from the 50s (and pre-50s) predeliction for naming dishes after people or places. It is not so much the style of the dishes as the range of ingredients they incorporate. Ignorant of such things, pine nuts, leaf coriander, wild mushrooms, mascarpone, lime leaf and chorizo would have been treated with the gravest suspicion by virtually the entire population 50 years ago. There was no extra-virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, polenta, basil or arborio rice; no chillies, lemon grass, pak choi, or durian; no preserved lemons, hoummous, pittas or baklava, the staples of the fashionable fridge and cupboard today. We have become familiar with what was once considered exotic and probably inedible.</p> <p> Foreign travel, immigration, technology, the rise of the supermarket and a relentless exploration of the world's cooking cultures in newspapers, magazines and on television have all contributed to an extraordinary expansion of our gastronomic horizons. At the same time they have also contributed to a parallel narrowing of our culinary endeavours.</p> <p> The convenience of the supermarket and sophistication of technology have released women from their traditional role of kitchen drab to find fulfilment in what had, traditionally, been male preserves. Men however have shown no parallel enthusiasm to make the reverse transition. More time spent in the workplace inevitably means less time devoted to the buying and preparation of food at home. Our cupboards may be crammed with the latest, fanciest oil, vinegar, condiment or comestible, but in truth food in the home is dominated by the pre-prepared meal and the microwave. Traditional cooking skills are as endangered as the giant panda or the Siberian tiger, and even the habit of sitting down and eating together really only survives through our visits to restaurants.</p> <p> So we have a curious paradox. Ostensibly our food experience is far greater than it was 50 years ago, but our food knowledge is less. We are more sophisticated in our expectations and more partial in our appreciation, more open to experimentation and more dismissive of our own culinary culture, more adventurous in our tastes and more reliant on official orginisations to protect us from our ignorance. So our attitude to food has changed, for better, for worse. Fifty years ago it was an essential, today it is a social accessory. We watch it on TV. We buy the books. We dream and drool. And then we pop out to eat the real thing prepared by someone else.</p>",
  "On Tuesday night I found myself addressing an audience of oil company executives (don't ask why). One of the most senior told me that there really was no need for panic buying, whatever the protesters get up to. What everyone should do, he said, was drive around with as full a tank as possible. Since all the cars in the country have twice as much storage space between them as there is under garage forecourts, we could keep going for several days even if there were a successful blockade. Of course it won't happen because people en masse are incapable of acting rationally. It's like the situation during dry summers. As soon as someone says, \"provided we use water carefully, there will be no need for a hosepipe ban\" everyone turns on the lawn sprinkler for a couple of days, so creating the need for a hosepipe ban. Saying \"there's no need for panic buying\" immediately triggers panic buying. I suspect there is nothing at all we can do about this. <p>I've been leafing through the brand new Penguin Book of Modern Quotations. This is the one which has created some controversy by including such savants as the Spice Girls (\"I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want.\") I think this is fine. We need a source and a date for familiar phrases, such as \"where's the rest of me?\" and \"I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate,\" and \"War! Ugh! What is it good for? Absolutely nuttin'.\" But a work of reference like this also works like a commonplace book, full of lines you've never heard but are pleased to discover. For instance, did you know that, on hearing of Stanley Baldwin's death, Churchill said: \"The candle in that great turnip has gone out\"? Or that Jerry Lee Lewis remarked in 1995: \"I'm not putting Elvis down, but he was a shitass, a yellow belly, and I hated the fucker\"? Alan Clark was once asked if there were any skeletons in his cupboard, and replied: \"Dear boy, I can hardly close the door.\" I appear three times, with lines I can scarcely recall writing at all, which means that no one is likely to bother to look them up at all, though I am quite pleased to see them attributed to me. </p> <p>Here's a joke which I've been telling people. Half of them laugh uproariously and the other half look completely blank. I was told it by Alan Coren, who attributes it to Barry Cryer, and he told it to us over lunch just after the waiter had interrupted the last line of an anecdote by asking him if he'd like parmesan cheese sprinkled on whatever it was he was eating. </p> <p>A commercial traveller is driving down a country lane at night when he runs out of petrol. Seeing the lights of a house in the distance he walks towards it, and is let in by a solicitous farmer who says no, he hasn't any petrol, but the chap is welcome to spend the night. The only snag is that he'll have to share a bed with the family's 17-year old daughter. She of course turns out to be a gorgeous blonde who smiles welcomingly and beckons him into the bed. He strips off fast and climbs in, at which point she leans across in her skimpy diaphonous nightie and says, \"would you like black pepper with that, sir?\" </p> <p>See what I mean? You either chortle merrily or look utterly bewildered. </p> <p>The Faber Book of Smoking is published this week. It's been edited by a smoker, James Walton, and it looks like part of a fight back by the massed ranks of wheezers and hawkers. (I used to know very slightly Dr Rob Buckman, who was a cancer specialist and part-time radio quiz show panellist. He told me, \"you know, every year I treat about a hundred people who are dying of lung cancer, and not one of them has ever said to me, 'Doctor, I know I'm dying in agony, but for the pleasure those fags brought me, it's been worth it.' Not one.\") Anyhow, when I smoked myself - up to 60 on some working days - I resolved never to become an anti-smoking bore because I hated them so much. By and large I've stuck to that: if people ask to smoke in our house we cry gladly, 'Yes, of course! Here are ash trays, cigar clippers, pipe reamers, hookahs, oxygen masks - anything you need!\". On the other hand, it gets a little difficult to stick to your resolution when people at the next restaurant table blow smoke over your food and then glower at you as if your eating was somehow getting in the way of their smoking pleasure. </p> <p>My sister's theory is that there are smokers and non-smokers, and you are fated to be one or the other. Non-smokers often accept other people's so they can have the odd one at parties. Smokers like me may have given up ages ago, but we are still smokers. I can't have just one cigarette any more than a recovering alcoholic can risk a single drink. I still have a recurring dream in which I have one sole cigarette and am hooked again for the rest of my life. I wake up sweating, and it can take a full 20 seconds to realise I am still doing cold turkey. </p> <p>Time for my biennial kvetch about the West End theatre. The other day I took my daughter to see J.B. Priestley's An Inspector Calls at the Garrick. The play is a fine old socialist rant, which I greatly enjoyed, not least because the principal villain is a dinner-jacketed northern manufacturer who says things like, 'Heh, heh, that way we can reduce wages and increase profits!\" It is staged quite brilliantly, with the most convincing rain I've ever seen indoors anywhere. But tickets, for the gods, were \u00a321 each (no cut price for children, even though it's a GCSE set text, which may account for the long run, and certainly no reduction for the fact that the whole play is just 105 minutes long), a small gin and tonic and a bottle of plain water cost \u00a34.90, and the programme, which was decked out like a sort of in-flight magazine, full of articles which had nothing to do with the play or the cast or the author or the theatre, or even the ice cream saleswoman, cost a princely \u00a32.75 (\"You don't really need to buy it,\" the attendant whispered to me.) </p> <p>I know all about the finances of the theatre, and how those who work in it believe devoutly that taxpayers should fork over huge sums to keep them going. But it did cross my mind that if they made the whole experience just a tiny bit less expensive, the theatre might have been more than half full.</p>",
  "Yasser Arafat plans to fly to Washington for talks with President Bill Clinton, the Palestinian leader's senior negotiator said yesterday after meeting the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright. <p>Saeb Erekat said in Washington that Mr Arafat had issued two public statements calling for an end to the violence in Israel, \"[and now] we want to see the United States exert every possible effort on the peace process. </p> <p>Despite the truce, clashes continued yesterday, but in Jerusalem Israelis returned in droves to the main market the day after a car bomb carrying 10kg of explosives killed two people. </p> <p>\"This is part of our life here, and we have to go back to our routine,\" Vered David said as he negotiated the crowded lanes of Mahane Yehuda market with carrier bags full off pastries. </p> <p>As both sides buried their dead and political leaders prayed for the strength to resist retaliation, two more Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli soldiers. Nevertheless, Israeli and Palestinian officials were hopeful that this ceasefire, the official announcement of which was cancelled after Thursday's car bomb, would hold. </p> <p>They were also unusually conciliatory. \"Despite the shooting and the clashes, I know that there are attempts, and there are intentions from the Palestinians to bring calm to the territories,\" the Israeli prime minister's security adviser, Danny Yatom, said. </p> <p>\"I am sure that in the coming hours, in the coming days, we will see more effective at tempts and we will see better results,\" he told Army Radio. </p> <p>Yasser Arafat's negotiator Nabil Shaath was also positive. \"We are doing our best. It is much calmer today in Gaza than on any day before.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile mourners gathered in the south-western suburbs of Jerusalem for the funeral of Hanan Levy, a lawyer, killed by Thursday's car bomb. The other victim, the daughter of a politician with a large following of Jewish settlers, was buried on Thursday night. </p> <p>In the village of Hizme, to the north-east, the funeral of a young Palestinian followed the familiar ritual: the coffin draped in a Palestinian flag surrounded by hundreds of mourners, slogans and stone-throwing, and then gunfire from Israeli soldiers. </p> <p>Within hours another teenager from Hizme was dead. A second Palestinian was shot dead in the West Bank city of Tuklarem. </p> <p>As on every Friday for the past six weeks, the violence began at the end of afternoon prayers, as marchers headed towards Israeli army positions. At Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip, and Bethlehem, Hebron and Ramallah in the West Bank, events unfolded according to the same pattern. </p> <p>In the Old City of Jerusalem there was relative calm, largely because worship was once again restricted to women and men over the age of 45. </p> <p>If this truce is to succeed, this pattern must be broken. \"We still have a list of martyrs who are dying now in intensive care units. If tomorrow there will be a funeral, after that for sure the funerals will go to the clashpoints, and [they will throw] stones, and the soldiers will shoot them with real bullets, and the circle will continue,\" said Hussam Khader, who leads Mr Arafat's Fatah militias in the West Bank city of Nablus. </p> <p>\"But if Israel takes its forces away from the entrances of Palestinian cities, and forces settlers not to attack Palestinian civilians, we can talk about a ceasefire. </p> <p>\"The problem is we have two forces on both sides: the settlers and the soldiers for Israel, and the police and the people for the Palestinians.\" </p> <p>As ever, the question remains whether Mr Arafat is able to rein in people who are determined to avenge their horrific lossesand the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, will resist pressure to retaliate for the market bombing. On Thursday night his cabinet gave the ceasefire 24 hours to produce results. </p> <p>\"This time I think we will see something new,\" Mr Khader said. \"The traditional type of uprising - demonstrations and stones - this will disappear in time, within two or three days. But maybe we will hear about attacks by the settlers, and attacks by the militias on soldiers and settlers.\" </p> <p>If Mr Khader is right the region is heading towards a war of attrition: a low-intensity conflict punctuated by daytime bombings in Israel and night raids on the Jewish settlements in the West Bank. </p> <p>\"If people have guns and attack settlements, then it is easy for them to destroy the ceasefire,\" he said. </p> <p>\"If Mr Arafat calls for a ceasefire and the new generation of Fatah agrees with him - not the traditional leaders - then he will achieve this. But if the people in the refugee camps say they do not want to accept it, then who has the power to impose a ceasefire? No one.\"</p>",
  "A man was ill with suspected Ebola fever in southern Uganda last night after he helped to nurse a patient who died of the deadly haemorrhagic fever last week, health officials said. <p>In the north, where the epidemic erupted in September, two more people died overnight. The death toll now stands at 84, and 267 people have been infected. </p> <p>Geofrey Kabango, a 27-year-old prisoner on parole, was looking after sick prison inmates and soldiers at Mbarara University hospital when he was taken ill on Thursday. </p> <p>Among the patients he was helping to care for was Samuel Bandese, 20, an army private who had recently moved from the northern town of Gulu, the heart of the epidemic, to the army barracks at Mbarara, about 50 miles from the border with Tanzania. </p> <p>Bandese was the first person outside the Gulu area to die in the present Ebola epidemic. </p> <p>Sam Okware, the commissioner for health services, said international health officials were in Mbarara with their Ugandan counterparts to examine all hospital staff and people in contact with the two men. </p> <p>The officials say they are confident that efforts to control the spread of the virus will not be derailed. </p> <p>\"Any case of Ebola worries us, but government and other officials have been very good,\" Mike Ryan of the World Health Organisation's surveillance and response unit said. </p> <p>\"We found that a limited number of people came in contact with the infected person in Mbarara. The response has been rapid enough.\" </p> <p>The fatality rate has been lower than expected: less than 40% of those who have contracted the disease have died, and 141 of those infected have been discharged from hospital.</p>",
  "Go, Al, go! The Democratic candidate is America's only sensible presidential choice next Tuesday. Despite his troubled campaign, Mr Gore has shown that he is a man who knows his business, has thought carefully about the issues and has the discipline, maturity and character required for the job. <p>His Republican opponent, George W Bush, has proved exactly the opposite. While likeable, even charming in a puppy-dog sort of way, the Texan governor's lack of top-flight experience, his vagueness and unfamiliarity with policy complexities and his evident intellectual laziness have become apparent to all. Neither man has articulated a startlingly different or inspirational vision for America at home. Both have set up their stalls on the crowded political centre ground, Mr Bush with his declared allegiance - somewhat at odds with his record - to \"compassionate conservatism\", Mr Gore with his vow to fight for middle America. Ideology is absent in new millennium America. There are, even so, decisive differences between their claims to the job. For his competence, his commitment and his genuine concern, Mr Gore is the man we hope the voters will pick. </p> <p>On the domestic front, Mr Gore is preferable for numerous reasons. Unlike Mr Bush, he will protect a woman's right to abortion and is clearly determined to uphold the legal rights of minority and disadvantaged citizens. Unlike Mr Bush, the Democrat will try to persuade Congress to enact tougher gun-control laws. When it comes to the key issues of social security provision, prescription medicines and health insurance for young and old alike, Mr Gore's proposals are both more equitable and workable than his opponent's. The Democrat acknowledges that campaign finance reform is essential if America's democracy is not to be further debased; yet despite the strong case for such reform made by John McCain, his main party rival, Mr Bush does not. Mr Gore acknowledges the need for more effective workplace regulation and tougher environmental standards; Mr Bush, the complete corporate candidate, does not. Mr Gore firmly believes that there is a legitimate role for government in a free market society, lest capitalism's excesses overwhelm the less fortunate; Mr Bush does not really. The Democrat refuses to squander the record budget surplus on massive, regressive tax cuts, preferring instead to invest some of that money in education, public services and debt reduction. Mr Bush, at his most irresponsible on this question, espouses reckless, inflationary tax giveaways that could stop the American economic miracle in its tracks and ultimately trigger a worldwide recession. </p> <p>In terms of foreign policy, Mr Bush (to the uncertain extent that he understands the issues at all) is the embodiment of all that is negative and ugly in post-cold war American thinking. He is the child of rightwing congressional and thinktank unilateralists, or neo-isolationists, who undermine the UN, ridicule concepts of nation-building, cut the foreign aid budget, wage trade wars and block or emasculate international treaties. Like them, Mr Bush supports US military disengagement in the Balkans and perhaps elsewhere, persists in regarding China and Russia as potential enemies, believes it right to besiege and bully out-of-favour countries with sanctions and threats, and complains that European allies are not pulling their weight. Yet like the hawks, the Republican simultaneously undermines Nato and global arms control by insisting on a national missile defence system for Fortress America. </p> <p>Mr Bush seems to know little, and care less, about non-military global threats like climate change, desertification, Aids, population growth and developing world poverty, debt and educational under-attainment. His is the exceptionalist mentality of the America Firster who views the outside world as strange and threatening. While this is hardly surprising in a man who has travelled beyond the US on only three occasions in his adult life (excluding visits to Mexico), it is hardly acceptable in a man who aspires to world leadership. His worst know-nothing instincts would probably be tempered by more seasoned advisers. But his is a strikingly narrower outlook than that of Mr Gore who, while hardly faultless on these many issues, would at least try to to maintain the limited, albeit self-serving, internationalism of the Clinton years. </p> <p>The manner in which this year's presidential campaign has been fought leaves much to be desired. Too often it has appeared as a mere beauty contest between two not particularly beautiful men. More than ever before, money, the media and pollsters have set the agenda, particularly through TV ads and chat shows that emphasised the personal and the trivial over the substantive and serious. One consequence is likely to be another disappointing voter turnout, at around 50%. The televised debates would have been more illuminating had the Green party candidate, Ralph Nader, been allowed to participate. Despite this, Mr Nader has waged a valuable and stimulating campaign. The Democrats would do well to give careful consideration to some of his proposed reforms. </p> <p>But after all is said and done, the marginalised Mr Nader cannot win and the lightweight Mr Bush should not be allowed to. When Joseph Lieberman, Mr Gore's running mate, said the Texas governor was not yet ready for the presidency, he was too kind. On this year's showing, Mr Bush is unlikely ever to be worthy of the job. Mr Gore, in contrast, the son of a Tennessee politician, a long-time senator, and vice-president for eight years, is tailor-made for it. It is true he sometimes seems doomed to be the ultimate man in a suit. Exciting he ain't. A visionary he is not. But he is the safe, wise choice - for them and us. So, on Tuesday: Go, Al, go!</p>",

And I tease people by saying: 'A leader, you can't say, follow me the world is going to be worse.' I'm an optimistic person. I'm an inherently content person. I've got a great sense of where I want to lead and I'm comfortable with why I'm running.\" Interview with the Washington Post, March 23 2000 </p> <p>\u0095\"The senator has got to understand if he's going to have - he can't have it both ways.

  "David Trimble suffered a humiliating blow to his credibility yesterday when Sinn Fein and the Irish government joined forces to launch a series of cross-border health initiatives in defiance of the Ulster Unionist leader - one of which was attended by a senior Trimble aide. <p>In a public relations coup for nationalists, Sinn Fein's health minister Bairbre de Brun and her southern Irish counterpart Micheal Martin unveiled a three-point plan that would have been blocked if a unionist ban on republicans had prevailed. </p> <p>Demonstrating their resolve to step up cross-border cooperation in the face of unionist opposition, the two ministers announced at a meeting in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, that they had commissioned new research into cross-border health care. This will cover: </p> <p>\u0095Renal care and radiotherapy; </p> <p>\u0095Assessment of new medical technologies; </p> <p>\u0095Planning of capital projects, such as building hospitals. </p> <p>The joint announcement was a calculated snub to Mr Trimble, who had attempted to block Sinn Fein from attending meetings of the north south ministerial council as a punishment for the IRA's \"failure\" to disarm. </p> <p>His action meant that yesterday's talks could not be a formal meeting of the council, a technicality that was overcome by Sinn Fein and the Irish government who held bilateral talks instead. </p> <p>Mr Martin delivered a powerful rebuke to Mr Trimble when he remarked pointedly that it would be difficult for the UUP leader to quibble with the health announcements because they were designed to \"save lives\". His remarks came after Mr Trimble's aides dismissed yesterday's meeting as \"pantomime politics\". </p> <p>Mr Martin reinforced his message when he said that the development of cross-border health care would have been set back if yesterday's meeting had been cancelled. \"Any disruption of a meeting between two ministers would have had a negative impact on cross-border cooperation, and would have set back the agenda and would have lost momentum,\" he said. </p> <p>The Trimble strategy turned to farce when one of his senior aides turned up at the meeting. Bertie Kerr, a Fermanagh councillor, presided over the second half of the meeting which was to launch a new cross-border food standards agency which he is to chair. Mr Kerr, an Ulster Unionist moderate whose presence was supported by Mr Trimble, defended his attendance, saying that he was not taking part in the ministerial meeting. </p> <p>Cutting a lonely figure at the gathering at Enniskillen's Killyhevlin hotel, Mr Kerr was the only person wearing a poppy in advance of the 13th anniversary of the town's Remembrance Sunday bombing. In a speech meant to be about food safety, Mr Kerr defended his party's sanction on Sinn Fein. </p> <p>\"Our party is not playing politics with health,\" he insisted. \"It is trying to get everybody to come along the road to democracy, a new start in Northern Ireland. [But] until republicans start pulling their weight, there will be sanctions.\" </p> <p>The PR coup by Sinn Fein and the Dublin govenment will embarrass Mr Trimble, not least in the eyes of unionist hardliners who will question whether his sanction against republicans can work. It is also likely to weaken his negotiatiing position with republicans who were furious with the UUP leader for taking action against them in the one area of the Good Friday agreement - cross border cooperation - that encouraged hardline republicans. However, he is unlikely to drop the ban.</p>",
  "Stymie had killed Lizard so there was a \"green light\" - the term for a go-ahead for a revenge killing - shining on the Temple Street gang when it met that night. But now a different kind of light is being shone on this meeting four years ago of the young gangsters of Los Angeles, and it has exposed another slice of the biggest police corruption scandal in the city's history. <p>This week four LAPD officers have been standing trial in what could be the first of many such cases. And the outcome will have huge political, social and cultural ramifications. </p> <p>Stymie is Anthony Adams, a member of the Temple Street gang who had killed Lizard, a leading member of the Mexican Mafia - a fearsome prison based gang strong enough to order killings from behind bars. </p> <p>Lizard had been collecting \"taxes\" on his gang's behalf and Stymie had shot him \"as a 'we're not going to pay' kind of thing\". The MM could not let this go unpunished and had demanded thousands of dollars as a \"fine\" before removing the \"green light\". </p> <p>The meeting that was due to take place at the corner of Temple Street and Coronado, a patch known to the police as the Snakepit, was for gang members to discuss how they were going to pay this fine. The police planned to be there, too, and pick up Stymie and his pals. </p> <p>The person explaining all this to fascinated jurors in the city's courtroom 109 is Brian Liddy, one of the accused. He looks like a bull in a sports jacket and is sitting in the witness box on this balmy November day being questioned by his attorney, Paul DePasquale. </p> <p>What happened after Liddy and his colleagues arrived at the Snakepit that night is what the jurors have to decide. </p> <p>Did he and his fellow officer, Michael Buchanan, really get hit by a pick-up truck driven by a getaway gangster or did they make the whole thing up, and frame and beat up the gang member? And are the officers part of a vast scandal that has led to killings, beatings, framings and drug dealing - all carried out by the men who should be enforcing the law? </p> <p>That story starts with Rafael Perez, a policeman caught stealing 2.7kg (6lb) of cocaine from a police locker room in 1998. In a plea bargain deal, he was given a five-year jail sentence in exchange for information about corruption among his fellow officers. </p> <p>What Perez told investigators has now led to more than 100 people having their convictions overturned and left the city facing bills for an estimated $135m (\u00a393m) in law suits from ex-gang members who were framed, beaten and, in one case, paralysed. One victim will not be suing personally: Juan Saldana, 21, was shot and left to bleed to death with a gun planted beside him. </p> <p>Every week over recent months it has seemed that a gang member, usually Latino, has emerged from prison with tales of beatings and plantings. </p> <p>One of the very worst cases was that of Javier Ovando, who was allegedly shot and paralysed by Perez and his fellow officer, Nino Durden. The officers then accused Ovando of attempted murder and he was jailed for 23 years, with the judge chiding him for his lack of remorse. Ovando is out now and will be compensated but will not walk again. </p> <p>The police union, the Police Protection League, has claimed that Perez was a rogue cop and was only implicating his colleagues to save his own skin. But morale among officers has slumped. They say they are now so concerned about being accused of framing or beating gang members that they spend their hours on duty avoiding trouble. This may be the reason for the recent rise in gang shootings, and the renewed activity among the more than 400 gangs and 60,000 gang members in the city. </p> <p>There is a heavy political undertow in LA to accusations that the police have abused their power. In 1992, 54 people died after the riots that followed the acquittal of officers caught on video beating Rodney King. In 1965, in the Watts section of LA, it was police action against an alleged drink driver that led to the riots in which 34 died. This time the city wants to show that it is acting properly, and hence the Los Angeles district attorney, Gil Garcetti, has initiated the prosecutions. </p> <p>Liddy, Buchanan and two other officers, Paul Harper and Edward Ortiz, accused of conspiring to pervert or obstruct justice, are the first fruits of Mr Garcetti's labours. And as their trial comes to its conclusion, there is a political dimension: Mr Garcetti is running for re-election next Tuesday. A conviction would help his credibility and an acquittal would pose questions about his judgment. </p> <p>This week has come a new twist: Perez is not giving evidence as planned because his ex-girlfriend has now claimed that he and a fellow rogue officer, David Mack, had killed a drug dealer and his mother and had buried their bodies in a rubbish tip in Tijuana, Mexico. The Mexican police found no remains. </p> <p>Perez is duly \"pleading the fifth\" - refusing to give evidence in case he incriminates himself in a double murder. But whatever happens in this case, the ramifications are already being felt throughout the city. </p> <p>A few miles from the downtown courthouse, in Boyle Heights in the Latino area of the city, sits Frank, as he suggests we call him. Frank, a good-looking, shaven-headed 20-year-old in a Nike jacket and jeans, has cut his teeth with the Playboys gang. He says that the framing of young gang members is routine and is himself suing the LAPD for planting marijuana and crack on him, which led him to a year in jail. </p> <p><b> Different rules</b><br> </p> <p> \"Rafael Perez was known to us more as a businessman than a policeman. He was one of the big dealers. Have things changed because of what happened? The police just play by different rules now.\" </p> <p>He said that instead of planting drugs on gang members, the police now arrest them for petty offences. \"They do it with righteous excuses now but they're still there.\" </p> <p>Frank is sitting in a room at the back of the centre where Father Greg Boyle - \"G-Dog\" as the young gang members call him - runs a programme that helps them find work and tries to get them out of the gang cycle. </p> <p>Father Greg, who probably knows as many gang members as anyone in California, has noticed a dramatic change in policing since the scandal broke, but it is not a change he welcomes. </p> <p>\"What we have now is police abuse that takes the form of absence,\" he says. \"There is an over-cautious tentativeness, a reluctance to stop the people that they should. They want to get to the ends of their shift not just without being shot but without having a grievance filed or a complaint levelled. Either they're violating human rights in the name of law enforcement or they have a hands-off policy. Both are wrong and both are not helpful. </p> <p>\"I buried my 85th and 86th kids last week,\" says Father Greg. \"One was a 19-year-old gang member and one was a 10-year-old girl caught in the crossfire. A lot of that comes from the tension that kept mounting that could have been largely remedied by a police presence but because we didn't have any, that [the shootings] became an inevitability.\" </p> <p>Back in court, the two young prosecuting attorneys, Laura Laesecke and Anne Ingalls, cross-examine other officers. Without Perez their case is weak. It is further weakened by the reluctance of the police witnesses to remember too clearly what happened on key nights. But Ms Laesecke has got her teeth into the case. She rides the constant cries of \"objection\" from the high-profile all-male defence attorneys as she tries to construct the case against the four. </p> <p>The judge, the elegant Jacqueline Connor, has been attacked by the local press for being pro-police. She watches as Liddy pauses for a split second while he answers as to whether he kicked the fleeing gang member so hard between the legs that he soiled himself. </p> <p>The presidential election has taken over the city's front pages and the taxes being discussed are the ones George W Bush would like to cut, not the kind imposed by the Mexican Mafia. The circumstances that created LA's gangs, the drug laws that take them to court and the jails in which so many languish have not been part of the presidential debate. Neither of the frontrunners offers much in the way of penal reform or a shift in the distribution of wealth. </p> <p>Amazingly to some outsiders, includ ing New York journalists covering the case, there has been little public outrage. To many in LA, it seems, what happens to the young gang members is what they deserve. </p> <p>James Ellroy's book LA Confidential told a story of police corruption in the 1950s, but it was not written until 1990. Perhaps we will have to wait a while for the full story of the current scandal and another 40 years to see Rafael Perez and his gang of untouchables on the big screen in all their terrible glory. </p> <p><b>Crimes and punishments</b></p> <p><b> July 1996</b><br> Police swoop on Temple Street gang and claim to have been injured by fleeing gang members.

  "<p><strong> Three vie for Nats sell-off</strong><br> </p> <p>The government yesterday announced a short list of three consortiums for the controversial part privatisation of National Air Traffic Services, Nats. </p> <p>The list brought an immediate call by unions representing air traffic controllers for the sale to be called off. One, the IPMS, said all three bidders were tainted by conflicts of interest. </p> <p>The short list includes the Airline Group, which brings together British Airways and Virgin Atlantic with six other UK airlines. Also in contention are Nimbus, made up of Serco, Arinc and PPM Ventures, and the Lockheed Martin-backed Novares group. But a bid submitted by US hi-tech group Raytheon has been discarded. </p> <p><strong> Dutch raid on BT offshoot</strong><br> </p> <p>Dutch competition authority the NMa said yesterday it raided offices of broadband company Versatel and mobile phone operator Telfort, owned by British Telecom, in investigating possible rules violations during the country's mobile phone licence auction. </p> <p>The raids followed a transport ministry hearing on Wednesday, where it emerged the two contenders had talked to each other at the start of the auction in July. \"The NMa reasonably suspects competition law has been trespassed,\" the authority said. \"Based on statements from Versatel and Telfort at the hearing of the transport ministry, suspicion has arisen that these two parties ... sought to influence the outcome of the auction.\" </p> <p>A Telfort spokesman downplayed the NMa action, saying it was a \"friendly meeting\". </p> <p><strong> Quaker Oats open to offers</strong><br> </p> <p>European food companies such as Cadbury Schweppes and Nestl\u00e9 could make a move for US food group Quaker Oats after the company rejected a $13bn approach from PepsiCo. </p> <p>The offer for Quaker represented about three times 1999 sales of $4.73bn, in an industry where companies tend to trade between once and twice times sales. </p> <p><strong> Greece to buy Eurofighter</strong><br> </p> <p>The Greek government is expected to sign a deal within the next few weeks to buy up to 90 Eurofighter aircraft, a project involving 40,000 British jobs. </p> <p>That was announced by defence minister Baroness Symons at the start of final assembly of the first production Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft at BAE Systems, at Warton near Preston, Lancashire. </p> <p>According to defence sources, the four-nation Eurofighter consortium fought off an attempt by France to sell its Rafale aircraft to the Greeks. </p> <p><strong> Cold comfort for Unilever</strong><br> </p> <p>Poor summer weather dented Unilever's strategy of concentrating on a limited number of brands with growth potential. The Anglo-Dutch consumer products group yesterday reported that dismal weather in Europe had held back third-quarter sales of ice cream and ready to drink teas. </p> <p>The group said third-quarter pre-tax profits rose 7% to \u00a3925m, partly offsetting the decline in the early quarters.</p>",
  "<p> If there's one thing I hate it's UnBooks - all those nasty, market-driven gimmicky little bits of fluff such as Craig Brown's Little Book Of Crap, Sada Walkington's Babe's Bible and, um, Julie Burchill's Diana, if you're going to be a cat about it. Whereas a real book is a glorious pustule of pain and pleasure, bursting forth with a life of it's own, an UnBook is nothing more than an extended magazine article, plumped up and puffed out by publisher and hack in cahoots to part the punter from his money.</p> <p>Mind you, there's an exception to every rule, and one of my prized possessions is The Complete Naff Guide, published by Arrow Books in 1983. Comprising hundreds of hilarious lists of all things naff, one of my favourites is the following, which I've edited for reasons of space:</p> <p><strong>NAFF PARASEXUAL ACTIVITY</strong></p> <p>Riding.<br> Watching wrestling on TV.<br> Dancing on own in self-adoring way in discotheque.<br> Walking around in the nude.<br> Walking in Wales.<br> Climbing mountains.<br> Playing squash.<br> Being a schoolmaster.<br> Having a massage in the afternoon from a tattooed Turk.</p> <p>See anything missing there? How about cooking, decorating and gardening? Of course, this was the innocent 80s, when we were all sure - from my thoroughly respectable working-class parents to my profoundly reprobate media mates - that leisure time was solely designed for the extreme usage of sex and alcohol. If you'd have told us that within 10 years British people would be working longer hours with less job security than anyone else in Europe, yet still the minute they walked in the front door would not reach for the Scotch bottle but for the secateurs, stencils or saffron, we'd have - well, we wouldn't have said anything, because we'd have been in a sex-and-drink stupor.</p> <p>The New Domesticity - is it parasexual, or what? Cooking - all that kneading and whipping and rising. Gardening - all that poking and prodding and planting seeds down on your knees. And as for decorating - sweating and sawing and pushing things in where they've no chance of fitting, splashing paint and paste all over the show. If they still made Carry On films, they wouldn't be set in holiday camps and hospitals, as they used to be, but in TV studios concerned with the making of cooking, gardening and decorating programmes. Double your entendre and take it away!</p> <p>Of course there's always been TV drudges, but we never felt the need to fancy them before. No one drooled on about Percy Thrower and Fanny Cradock, even though their names seemed to beg for a verbal groping. Yet this island is full of boobies who claim to fancy Charlie Dimmock and Alan Titchmarsh, Carol Smillie and Handy Andy, Nigella Lawson and Jamie Oliver. (Okay, scratch that last one. Not fancying Jamie Oliver would be as perverse as not fancying a golden labrador puppy, and I certainly don't intend to rock the boat on this one.) It's because we're putting our sex-emotions where our nesting-emotions should be, and vice versa, and everything's got horribly skewed. I recently read poor dear Roy Strong describing a vile-sounding gardening book (A Gentle Plea For Chaos, by Mirabel Osler) thus: \"This is gardening as a tempestuous, angry love affair.\" I'm sorry, but that's just plain barking. </p> <p> I once heard a comic say how sad and strange it is that when we're home-bound teenagers and have nowhere to have sex in the warm and dry, we want it all the time. But the minute we get our own home and warm, dry rooms in which to Do It, we don't want to Do It at all. The New Domesticity is the buzz of glamorous denial that desire is dead: Oh, I'd love to have wild dirty sex with you, but I've got to ice this cake/rag-roll this wall/prune these roses.</p> <p>When did all this rushing about like Keystone Kops start? I bet they don't do it in Italy. Nor in the past, that other sun-kissed foreign country, either. When my parents got home from work, and I from school, we were more than happy to laze fustily around the imitation-log gas fire and gaze raptly at \"colour TV\" eating fish and chips from newspaper. Walking the dog around the block was the only reason we would ever see fit to stir our stumps. As a child, it was the most restful and secure home life I can imagine. If my mother had been constantly in the kitchen, or my father in the garden, or the pair of them running wildly around the house re-decorating it, I wouldn't have liked that at all. I'd have thought there was something wrong with their marriage. And I'd have been right.</p> <p> One of the great things about going steady with someone is the endless hours you can spend with them doing absolutely nothing; like a lot of other things about love, from baby voices to nipple-sucking, it takes you right back there to a pre-work state of grace. The minute you feel the need to look for diversion, the magic has gone. And you might as well start dividing up your records now, because whether it takes six months or six years, your love is on the way out. Pulp's greatest and saddest song, Live Bed Show, says it best: \"She doesn't have to go to work/But she doesn't want to stay in bed/Cos It's changed from something wonderful/To something else instead.\" People seem to have totally lost the ability to do nothing; perhaps that's why we're addicted to the Royle Family - we think we're laughing at them, but we're really envying their comatose comfort. Frightened by the insecurity of the jobs market, perhaps, it is almost as if we feel that Da Big Boss Man can see us even when we're at home, and we feel we've got to prove to him that our work ethic goes right to the bone.</p> <p>To put a twist on that really dumb clich\u00e9 about how \"people who love animals don't like people\", I would say that there is a good case to be made that people who bang on a bit too much about \"beautiful homes\" and \"happy families\" don't actually like people, in all their difficult, messy glory. In the past, it was the tyrannical Mr Barrett-type paterfamilias who sought to bend and break his family to his will in the name of domestic harmony. Now it comes smelling of vanilla, nutmeg and varnish. But it's still a con. \"Home\" is where the people we love are. And once they're gone, no cooking smells, stencilled borders or roses around the door will make it home again. It's time we stopped kidding ourselves otherwise, put down our mindless implements, stopped our endless fidgeting and enjoyed our loved ones while we can.</p>",
  "Okay, own up. Who has tried smoking the ultimate roll-up, a cinnamon stick, instead of Anne Widdecombe's least favourite recreational drug? How many had their faces contorting as they tried to get something of a hit? The plain truth is that the spices freshly ground are so potent as to render even the innocent quite dizzy. Not that the shenanigans of those who pioneered the spice trade aren't spicy enough in their own right. <p>Our own colonial history was propelled by the desire to monopolise the spice trade, competing with the French and the Dutch. In those days, much like today, imperial conquest was privatised, and the business of securing the colonies, trades and routes delegated to such companies as the East India Company.</p> <p>But before all that, it was spices, and the fabulous prices they fetched, that drove European sailors and merchants to explore the rest of the world. Why, America might have remained undiscovered for many more years, had not Christopher Columbus, a native of Genoa financed by the court of Spain, not gone looking for another route to the Spice Islands of the East. How much art and vainglory owed its existence to cinnamon and cloves?</p> <p>Cinnamon, cloves, pepper and nutmeg are possibly the most important of all the spices, and are among the earliest to be used. Native to the Moluccas in what is now East Indonesia, cloves are mentioned in China as early as the third century BC. The worth of these spices became incalculable, for, not only did they give a fine flavour to foods, but their medicinal properties were considered potent indeed. Cloves were used to sweeten the breath and later, counteract BO. Oil of cloves is an antiseptic, and is still used to deaden toothache, and so it is not surprising that it crops up in brines and pickles, both methods of preserving foods. Alan Davidson's The Oxford Companion To Food explains that the name clove derives from the French clou de girofle, literally nail of clove, which aptly describes the bud in its dried form. When used sparingly, most notably in stews, braises and soups, it adds a most pleasing richness and depth to the finished dish.</p> <p>The history of cinnamon goes back even further- to 2500BC, in fact, when the ingenious Chinese recorded its use. The search for true cinnamon, as opposed to wild cinnamon and cassia - curiously known to pharmacists as senna pods - has a history as long as it is strange. In his fascinating book on spices, Dangerous Tastes (British Museum Press), Andrew Dalby tells that cinnamon was considered as great a prize as gold, and that the legend of La Canela was as powerful as that of El Dorado. Gonzalo Pizarro led a 2,000-strong expedition to exhaustion and death in the forests of Ecuador in search of it. Only 80 men returned. But in spite of their popularity in the cooking of India, Arabia and North Africa, we don't use cinnamon and cloves with the enthusiasm we used to. The use of cinnamon has waned from the days when it flavoured desserts and creams before being cast aside in favour of vanilla. Indeed, that loathsome brew, mulled wine, a recipe to put anyone off spice, wine and Christmas simultaneously, is a last bastion of recognised spice in the contemporary kitchen.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b>Spiced potatoes and spinach</b><br></p> <p><b>1.5kg fresh spinach</b><br> <b> 3 medium onions</b><br><b> 1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger</b><br> <b> 8 cloves garlic</b><br><b> 1 fresh hot chilli</b><br><b> 8 tbsp vegetable oil</b><br> <b> 2kg good, large waxy potatoes</b><br> <b> 1 medium cauliflower <b> 1 stick cinnamon</b><br><b> 7 whole cloves</b><br><b> 7 whole cardamom pods</b><br><b> 2 bayleaves</b><br> <b> 2 tbsp ground coriander</b><br> <b> 1 tbsp ground cumin</b><br> <b> 1 tsp ground turmeric</b><br><b> 1 large tomato</b><br><b> 2 tbsp plain yoghurt</b><br><b> Sea salt</b><br><b> 1 tbsp garam masala</b><br></b></p> <p><b>Remove any excess stalk and damaged leaves from the spinach.

  "<p>In the 16th century the Alps were as distant from the normal world as was the moon. To many they represented hell, combing the freezing conditions of a Nordic Niflheim , the Nordic mythological underworld, with, in summer, the roasting inferno of Christianity. Here was a realm whose upper reaches were, by all accounts, home to a race of malformed and malevolent sub-humans. The peaks above were inhabited by demons and witches were well attested. It was an undisputed fact that dragons lived in Alpine caves, ready to incinerate any who set foot above the snowline. By the late 18th century, however, scientific gentlemen began to turn their minds to these high places. What would the peaks tell us about the atmosphere, about weather, about glaciers? </p> <p>In the 19th century the British came on the scene, full of imperial confidence and set out to plant their flag on every peak in the Alps. The Matterhorn disaster of 1865 was one of those tragic events of which the Victorians were so fond and to which they were so prone. It ranked in popular imagination alongside Franklin's disappearance in the Arctic andLivingstone's death in Africa. It shaped the childhood perceptions of millions and it had, uniquely, a survivor who could describe it at first hand. Edward Whymper, who was only in his mid-20s at the time of the disaster, was bedevilled by it for the rest of his life </p> <p>On July 12 1865 Whymper, a printer and Alpinist, was in the small village of Breuil at the foot of the unconquered Matterhorn. He was woken with the news that an Italian party - led by the guide Jean-Antoine Carrel, whom Whymper thought he had hired to climb the mountain - had begun an ascent. </p> <p>Whymper was furious. He had been \"bamboozled and humbugged\". He snatched a telescope and peered through it. Yes, there was Carrel and his party, making their way up the lower slopes. But his group was large and unwieldy. It would take them three days to reach a position from which they could tackle the summit. If he moved fast, Whymper could be in Zermatt inside a day and, conditions willing, could be on the summit two days later. But he had no guide. Miraculously, Whymper was saved by the arrival of Lord Francis Douglas, an \"exceedingly amiable and talented\" 18-year-old whose brother, the Marquess of Queensberry, would later instigate the Oscar Wilde trial. </p> <p>Douglas was no stranger to daring exploits: he had scaled the walls of Edinburgh castle aged 14, and had swum the Hellespont aged 16. Although not an experienced mountaineer, he had done some fine climbing that season and had in tow Young Peter Taugwalder, namesake and son of Old Peter Taugwalder from Zermatt. </p> <p>Father and son had carved themselves a reputation for leading tourists up the easier slopes. Old Peter had reconnoitred the north-east ridge of the Matterhorn and was convinced, like Whymper, that it was surmountable. Whymper was immediately interested. Did Douglas truly want to climb the Matterhorn from Zermatt? Yes. Could Young Taugwalder carry their gear there? Douglas agreed and the next day the two Englishmen went down to the Monte Rosa hotel in Zermatt, where they instructed Old Peter Taugwalder to prepare for an immediate attack on the Matterhorn. </p> <p>The Rev Charles Hudson, and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Douglas Hadow, were also staying in the Monte Rosa and were also planning to climb the Matterhorn. Whymper and Hudson agreed that it would be wasteful for two separate teams to go up the Matterhorn. Hudson, vicar of Skillington in Lincolnshire, was the glamorous face of British mountaineering. He was a handsome, cheerful man. Young women stuck his photograph in their albums, from where it smiled out romantically above a dashing signature. But at the same time he was entirely self-effacing. \"Although he had done the greatest mountaineering feats which have been done, he was the last to speak of his own doings.\" Hadow was a different proposition. He was 19, and it was his first season in the Alps. In such a large expedition, the group was dependent on its weakest member. Hadow was indisputably the weakest member. </p> <p>For Hudson and Whymper, the Matterhorn was so much easier than they had expected that, on the morning of July 13, they led the way, taking turns to hack steps in the ice while the guides hung back. When they made camp on a ledge at 11,000 feet they were almost delirious. Croz, an experienced guide, and Young Peter Taugwalder scouted ahead and returned with the news that there was \"not a difficulty, not a single difficulty!... We could have gone to the summit and returned today easily!\" Everybody went to bed in good spirits. The next day Whymper handed the lead to Croz. The rocks were testing in places, and extremely exposed, but Whymper thought it a lot easier than other climbs. He was worried, however, by Hadow, who \"was not accustomed to this kind of work and required continual assistance\". </p> <p>They went up and up, crossing 400 feet horizontally here, ascending 60 feet vertically there, then doubling back to a convenient ridge when their way was blocked. There was an awkward corner and finally they were there, separated from the summit by 200 feet of snow. \"The last doubt vanished!\" Whymper wrote, \"The Matterhorn was ours!\" Whymper ran along the ridge. Peering over the edge, he saw his Italian rivals some 1,250 feet below, crawling like ants up the hillside. He and Croz yelled and waved their arms, to no apparent effect. \"We must make them hear us; they shall hear us,\" Whymper cried. He seized a block of stone and hurled it down. Croz joined him and together they wrestled lumps of crag down the cliff. Whymper crowed: \"The Italians turned and fled.\" </p> <p>Then came the flag-planting. One of the tent poles had been removed that morning - against Whymper's protestation that they were tempting providence - and it was now embedded on the northern end of the ridge with Croz's shirt tied to it as a flag. It was visible from all directions. </p> <p>Down in Breuil, convinced that their group had succeeded, the inhabitants came out en fete, toasting Carrel, Italy and the Matterhorn. It was only when the dejected team arrived home that they learned their mistake. \"It is true,\" said the Italians. \"We saw them ourselves - they hurled stones at us! The old traditions are true - there are spirits on the top of the Matterhorn!\" </p> <p> Around 3pm on July 14, Hudson and Whymper agreed on their order of descent. While they were roping up, Whymper spent a last few minutes sketching the summit and then, darting back up to put their names in a bottle, he took his place in the chain. The adrenalin which had carried them to the top was gone, leaving them shaky-legged and exhausted. They took exaggerated care on the rocks they had bounded up so eagerly that morning. Hadow, who was the weariest of them all, had his feet guided into position by Croz. Their precautions were standard practice for any well guided party coming home after a new conquest, save for one important difference - although the leaders were tied to one of the stronger ropes, Old Peter and Douglas were linked by the weakest of the lot. </p> <p>Croz put his axe to one side so that he could assist Hadow on a tricky slope. What occurred next could only be guessed at. Whymper's theory was that Croz had helped Hadow into a safe position and had then turned round to pick up his ice axe. As he did so, Hadow slipped and knocked Croz over. Whymper did not see it happen, his view being blocked momentarily by a rock, but he witnessed every moment of the subsequent tragedy. </p> <p>\"I heard one startled exclamation from Croz, then saw him and Mr Hadow flying downwards; in another moment Hudson was dragged from his steps, and Lord F Douglas immediately after him. All this was the work of a moment. Immediately we heard Croz's exclamation, Old Peter and I planted ourselves as firmly as the rocks would permit: the rope was taut between us and the jerk came on us both as one man. We held; but the rope broke midway between Taugwalder and Lord Francis Douglas. For a few seconds, we saw our unfortunate companions sliding downwards on their backs, and spread ing out their hands, endeavouring to save themselves. They passed from our sight uninjured, disappeared one by one, and fell from precipice to precipice on to the Matterhorngletscher below, a distance of nearly 4,000 feet. From the moment the rope broke, it was impossible to help them.\" </p> <p>Whymper and the two Taugwalders did not move for half an hour. Old Peter burst into tears. Young Peter cried, \"We are lost! We are lost!\" With difficulty Whymper persuaded Young Peter to leave his perch - they were still roped together and unless he moved they were stuck - then guided father and son back to Zermatt. They went down slowly and carefully, searching for their companions' bodies as they went, sometimes calling out in the vain hope that one of them might have survived. Whymper later wrote to a friend. \"For two hours after the accident I thought every moment that the next would be my last... the two guides were unnerved to such an extent that I suspected every minute one or the other would have slipped, and then it would have been all over.\" </p> <p>At 9.30pm, Whymper chose \"a wretched slab, barely large enough to hold the three\", on which to spend the night. Six hours later there was enough moonlight for them to continue the descent. They went down in silence, met the first chalets, and then ran all the way to Zermatt. Whymper burst into the Monte Rosa hotel and made for his room, pursued by an inquisitive landlord. As he closed the door he announced \"The Taugwalders and I have returned.\" </p> <p>The landlord roused the village and 20 men went on their way to the base of the north face. When they reached the scene they found Croz and Hadow lying next to each other on the snow, with Hudson some 50 yards distant. The bodies had been stripped almost naked during the fall and were so battered that they were barely recognisable - Croz was missing the top half of his head and was identified only by his beard and by a rosary cross. Of Douglas there was no trace, save a pair of gloves, a belt and a boot. His body had either caught on a ledge or had been shredded as it bounced from rock to rock. Apart from a single coat sleeve, nothing more was ever found of him. </p> <p>The news broke slowly, inaccurately and piecemeal. Whymper wrote a description of the tragedy in the visitors' book of the Monte Rosa, which was stolen almost immediately, but it was August 8 before he published a definitive account in the Times. Until then, wild rumours circulated that made Zermatt, briefly, the most famous place in Europe. Climbers from every nation rushed to the village, impelled by the desire to help, to offer condolences or simply to gawp. </p> <p>On July 19, the British consul in Geneva sent his chaplain to conduct a private inquiry and on July 21, Zermatt opened its own inquest. Midway through its deliberations, a wrenchingly ignorant telegram arrived from Douglas's mother, Lady Queensbury: \"Is it not possible to seek in the rocks above or to let down food?\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Whymper was giving his deposition to the local court. He told everything as it had happened and blamed the fall entirely on the use of the weak rope. Looking at the piece he had retained as evidence, the officials accepted his deposition without question. It was flimsy beyond belief and had clearly snapped. (Sections of all three ropes are preserved in Zermatt's Alpine museum. The one that broke is little thicker than a washing line.) The verdict was accidental death. </p> <p> What was not explained (or asked), however, was why the weak rope had been used in the first place. Whymper threw out diversionary leads, blaming Hudson for having allowed Hadow to be a member of the party and hinting at a conspiracy within Zermatt's judicial system. Hadow's father thought Whymper had gone too far in abrogating all responsibility. \"We have been greatly distressed at Mr Whymper's letter in the Times and the leading article which I was sure would follow,\" he wrote on August 10. \"He might have spared those unnecessary remarks about poor Hudson, which have brought blame on him for want of prudence and caution.\" Emily Hudson, Charles Hudson's wife, felt the same. Lurid reports were already circulating and she was angry that Whymper should have cast her husband as the wrongdoer. \"I cannot tell you how it has distressed me,\" she wrote. \"I am very much surprised that Mr Whymper should have been a party to it. Of course one knows the craving there is in the public mind for the sensational, in any form; but it really makes me sick to think of such a subject being used to gratify their tastes.\" </p> <p>Whymper was released from the inquest on July 22 1865 and came home to find himself the most talked-about person in London. A fellow Alpine club member wrote that he was \"most truly to be pitied, for his name is so connected with the Matterhorn, and rather wild designs upon it, that people are sure to blame him for the accident\". </p> <p>Until that year, fatalities in the Alps had been relatively rare, something for the exploring community to remark upon; after that date they became commonplace. In 1870 an entire party of 11, led by a Scot, the Rev G MacCorkendale, got lost in a blizzard and perished on Mont Blanc. The bodies of six of the climbers were never found. As the fatalities increased, Queen Victoria's private secretary wrote to prime minister Gladstone, \"The Queen commands me to ask you if you think she can say anything to mark her disapproval of the dangerous Alpine excursions which... have occasioned so much loss of life.\" </p> <p>The Matterhorn disaster shaped the remainder of Whymper's life. Never very sociable, he withdrew still further. According to his sister, \"his unfortunate habit of sleeplessness had become fixed, and he practically turned night into day\". His main preoccupation was writing up his journals for publication. But he did not stop exploring: he made two expeditions to Greenland, he climbed new peaks in the Andes and the Rockies and, his funds having been exhausted by these forays, wrote guidebooks to Zermatt and Chamonix. He received the Royal Geographical Society's gold medal and was proposed for - but was not granted - membership of the Royal Society. The disaster was a topic he returned to again and again in lecture halls, magazine articles and private correspondence for the 46 years until his death, but he seemed interested only in proving that he was not to blame. </p> <p>Whymper's relations with women had not been successful, but in 1899 he fell in love with Charlotte Hanbury, one of the few women climbers active in the Alps. She was 10 years his senior and died unexpectedly the following October. The news reached him just as he was starting a lecture tour in America. \"My beloved friend gone!\" he wrote to his sister. \"I hardly know how to carry on.\" </p> <p> His health began to deteriorate and he became prone to unexpected collapses that left him in a state of semi-consciousness. In 1905 a fall on a mountain path damaged several ribs; he received a severe blow to the head in a railway accident. \"My present condition is deplorable,\" he wrote in October. \"My memory has gone !... [I am] a Wreck without Brains.\" His memory returned but he was concerned that he was losing fitness and, when he visited Zermatt a few weeks after the crash, it appeared that he was losing his fame as well. It was freezing, nobody was there to greet him and the hotels were full: he drew together two station benches and slept on them under a rug. </p> <p>The next year, at the age of 66, he married Edith Mary Lewin of Forest Gate, London. She was 45 years younger than him. The wedding was a grisly occasion, conducted in great secrecy. At the wedding breakfast it took half an hour's persuasion before Whymper could be dragged out of his bedroom. McCormick, the presiding vicar, gave a leery address about the difference in their ages. When the wedding was over, Whymper told his nephew, the only member of his family invited to the ceremony, to search the guests in case they had stolen the silver. </p> <p>The union did not last. The couple had a daughter and divorced in 1910. The separation was bitter. \"Her sole aim is money,\" he wrote to his sister. He sold his house, his books and even his climbing equipment to stay financially afloat. The following year he visited Zermatt, from where he went to Geneva and then up to Chamonix. It was to be his last Alpine scramble, and perhaps he knew it. </p> <p>At Chamonix he checked into a hotel where the staff were accustomed to his preference for being left alone. He visited a few bookshops and made arrangements to help find the corpses from the 1870 Mont Blanc disaster which were expected soon to emerge from the glacier. Then, suddenly, went back to his hotel and locked himself into his room. During the next two days, Whymper died. The whole village turned out to watch his funeral. </p> <p>All the great mountains were subsequently conquered one by one, by insouciant public schoolboys and dogged tradesmen alike. By the end of the second world war the Alps had changed irrevocably. Ski resorts proliferated as entrepreneurs devoured the empty spaces. </p> <p>Gradients were bulldozed and forests were cut down to create pistes. Ropes were pinned to the Matterhorn to make life easier for those wishing to conquer the Big Rock. This well-groomed wilderness was no place for dragons. Yet its upper levels retained a strange fascination. Climbers still strode across passes, clambered over glaciers and struggled with dangerous new routes. Far fewer in number than the thousands who rushed to the Alps every winter, they preserved a glimmer of the old romance. Like their predecessors, they were trespassers in a hostile environment; they were adventurers in an old tradition. </p> <p>\u0095 Adapted from Killing Dragons: the Conquest of the Alps by Fergus Fleming (Granta, \u00a320).

And with some reason: for more than 10 years, certainly from 1890 to 1900, what you thought about Wilde was a reliable indicator of what you thought and felt about a whole range of emotive issues, ranging from specifics such as sodomy, interior decoration and the West End to more obscure yet fundamental notions of cultural and personal identity. His rise and fall made a front-page drama out of the meanings of masculinity and effeminacy, respectability and fashion, and modernity itself. This symbolic status has not faded over the intervening 100 years. Wilde has continued to function as a kind of cultural litmus test, his name a shorthand for all kinds of surprising allegiances. </p> <p>Every decade of the last century found a different way of using Wilde to express its own concerns. In the era when his name was literally considered unspeakable, at least in this country, paperback copies of The Ballad of Reading Gaol and The Soul of Man under Socialism were badges of political radicalism. Meanwhile Strauss's operatic Salome of 1905 maintained Wilde's reputation as the ne plus ultra of decadence. EM Forster's Maurice, cowering unpublished in the closet in 1914, miserably branded himself \"an unspeakable of the Oscar Wilde sort\". Each of the very different theatrical and film Wildes reinvented him in turn as the image of their own times. In the 1970s, his name was taken in vain by a new kind of badge-wearer; a popular button among stroppier queens of Liberation-era London read simply \"Avenge Oscar\". In our own time Stephen Fry, launching a film that, despite noble intentions, gave us the Wildean pill sugared with a 1990s mix of cost-free sympathy and celebrity, unblushingly compared Wilde to Christ. </p> <p>So to what new uses will this brilliant and fascinating artist be put in our new, millennial and - as you have no doubt noticed - centenary decade? Who is Wilde now, in the year 2000? Sadly these two new titles, optimistically published to cash in on the festivities, fail to discover any new echoes or resonances in the magic name. The only sound generated is the rather ugly one of the barrel being scraped. Greedy publishers and lazy editors, rather than the poor besotted authors, must, I think, take the primary blame for this. Both Barbara Belford and Joan Schenkar have, in their different ways, fallen under the Wilde spell; but Virago and Bloomsbury might have done well to dampen or at least discipline their infatuations. </p> <p>The idea of a new biography so soon after Richard Ellmann's magisterial heavyweight has an appealing chutzpah. Indeed, Belford is right to take him to task for his omissions, and my hopes rose when she promised to illuminate Wilde anew by grounding him securely in the context of both homosexual life and theatrical practice in the late 19th century. The problem is, she doesn't deliver. Although she repeatedly mentions that Wilde had sex with other men, she does nothing with the available historical facts. Picturesque but unsubstantiated speculation that things may have been rather neoclassical between the sheets - early exposure to Graeco-Roman statuary in the National Gallery of Ireland having led directly to intercrural copulation with Robbie Ross in the study at Tite Street in 1887 - really won't do. </p> <p>Her account of late Victorian theatre is hopelessly clogged with irrelevant detail. I was happy to be told that the New York theatre was revolutionised in 1882 by Steele Mackage's invention of the tip-up seat, but unsure what this had to do with Wilde's attempts to stage a hit there. The effect of ill-digested research is pervasive: there are lots of things that need to be said about Wilde's father, but was such a dramatic account of his illegal acquisition of a set of mummified ibis (\"sacred, long-legged, white wading birds\") while on holiday in Egypt really necessary? Despite the promise that this is a \"fresh look\" at Wilde, the only really distinctive thing about this book is Belford's occasionally startling turn of phrase. I was frankly amazed to learn that in fin de si\u00e8cle Algeria \"boys showed their availability by scrambling up men's trousers\". Belford claims that she has spent five years \"getting to know the inner Wilde\", and that the familiar material is delivered \"with a new, centenary spin\". Truth is, this is just a rehash: she has nothing new to say, and says it clumsily. </p> <p>Joan Schenkar can at least claim to be first in the queue. Her contribution to the Wilde centenary is an oblique one: the first biography of Oscar's previously undocumented niece, Dolly. Although Dolly is the ostensible subject, Uncle is named at least once on every page; the constant comparison and overshadowing matches that which dogged Dolly all her life. By the time she hit the saloons of 1920s Paris, she was the last Wilde. This was her entr\u00e9e, and she made a point of talking and looking like her uncle whenever she could. She was, according to girlfriends, both a notable wit and an uncannily convincing lookalike when in Oscar drag. Trouble is, she was precious little else; she took a perverse pride in never writing a word of fiction despite constant assurances that she was destined for literary greatness by virtue of the family aura. True, she dined with, borrowed from, insulted or slept with almost everyone in the astonishing rue Jacob lesbian salon, sliding into major addictions (fast cars, drink, drugs and \"emergency seductions\") before ending up face-down in a rented Belgravia flat at the age of 46. But while simultaneously injecting under the table and dishing the dirt on duchesses may have been chic, it hardly adds up to a career. </p> <p>Schenkar tries hard to argue that this absence of achievement is itself significant, and that underneath the surface dazzle of proto-It Girl outrage there is a serious book about how the Wildean iconography of self-destruction was replayed in a feminine, feminist, modern and modernist world. I wasn't convinced. The opening chapters are spirited and inventive, but although this biographer is commendably besotted by her subject, and often stylishly successful in evoking an extraordinary lost world of Vionnet frocks and detox clinics, Dolly quickly began to pall. Her uncle's achievement was to lodge himself, for better or for worse, permanently in the public imagination. Dolly lived off his myth, rather than substantially elaborating or elucidating it. The same, I'm afraid, might be said for both these biographies. </p> <p> \u0095 Neil Bartlett's new play about Wilde, In Extremis, is at the National Theatre.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Civilizations</strong></p> <p> Felipe Fernandez-Armesto</p> <p> 636pp, Macmillan</p> <p> \u00a325 <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000093350,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> Civilization is a knotty word. The good Doctor Johnson, for example, was not about to let it through the hallowed portals of his Dictionary, as Boswell tells us: \"He would not admit civilization, but only civility. With great deference to him, I thought civilization, from to civilize, better in the sense opposed to barbarity, than civility.\" </p> <p>Today we no longer reach so comfortably for words like \"barbarity\". But, as Boswell rightly points out, the word \"civilization\" is derived from the verb \"to civilize\", so what it can usefully denote is a process rather than a congealed achievement. Civilization, properly, is the process of rendering a society more civil. It is a political concept, deriving ultimately from the Latin \"civis\", citizen of a community, and the idea of what is proper to a citizen, which is \"civilitas\" or courtesy. It is in this sense that a beautifully sardonic Gandhi murmured that western civilization \"would be a good idea\". </p> <p>Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, however, claims to believe that the idea of a civilizing \"process\" - whereby societies might learn to live together more peacefully and productively - is tainted irrevocably by the horrors of 20th-century dreams of \"progress\": fascism and Soviet communism. This is rampant nonsense. The fact that some dreams of progress have been wicked is no good reason to abandon the idea of progress itself. It is undeniable that universal suffrage and the abolition of the death penalty have contributed to the civilization of this country in the past century. And we ought constantly to demand more civilization, rather than to abandon the idea completely out of a misguided world-historical pessimism. </p> <p>But then, the key to understanding the deliberate eccentricity of Fernandez-Armesto's book lies in his hysterical anti-liberalism. He is a man complacently \"waiting for the conservative nirvana\", and seriously claims at the book's climax that \"liberal principles become the forerunners of death camps and eugenics\". Such nasty pottiness bookends this fat work: at the start, he smears the work of Arnold Toynbee with the following disgustingly uncivil innuendo: \"Toynbee's enthusiasm for 'pioneer' leaders, steering civilization towards collective goals, seems chilling in a work published just after Hitler came to power.\" Another theorist of civilization, Kenneth Clark, is dismissed for what Fernandez-Armesto calls his \"warped perspective\". But Clark's perspective - his preference for a marble Apollo over an African mask - was no more \"warped\" than any other: it was simply a perspective. It would seem hard, indeed, to write from no perspective at all; unless, perhaps, you can attain the godlike objectivity of a Fernandez-Armesto. </p> <p>Our author's claim is that civilization is fundamentally a measure of how man refashions his environment to his own ends. He solicits both praise for this idea's novelty (\"This is an experimental work ... meant to be ... unprecedented\") and respect for its venerability (\"The usage I advocate is justified by tradition\"), thus setting a rigorously maintained precedent of having his cake and eating it. He notices that Toynbee had the idea in 1919, but dismisses his formulation on a technicality and then conveniently forgets about it. He promises grandly that his revolutionary new recategorisation will open up fresh vistas of historical truth. </p> <p>Up to a point. The central 500 pages are devoted to a grand tour of world history by environment: hostile wastelands of desert, tundra and ice; swathes of uncultivable grassland; tropical and temperate forests; alluvial soils; highlands, islands and \"seaboard civilizations\". The plurality of the book's title emphasises that civilization is not confined to western Europe or other lucky pockets of geography: human ingenuity ensures that it happens pretty much anywhere humans can stay alive. Great structures have been built in rebarbative rainforest or on shifting mud. Fernandez-Armesto's scheme enables pretty juxtapositions (the Aztecs, Ethiopians and Tibetans are seen to have overcome similar problems of altitude) and provocative revaluations (the Aztecs, again, seem more heroically competent in \"civilizing\" their environment than the classical Greeks). </p> <p>But Fernandez-Armesto, in the interest of covering all bases, is so systematically self-contradictory as to be almost comically incoherent. Environment shapes civilization; no, it doesn't; yes, it does; er, OK then, civilizations are \"neither determined nor uninfluenced by environment\". Well, who is going to argue with that? Temporary and mutually exclusive criteria of civilizational \"success\" flash past. The Inuit, for example, are less \"civilized\" than modern Europeans because they have adapted themselves to their icy environment rather than attempting to change it; then again, maybe civilization would be an \"irrational strategy\" in such terrain, \"at least where long-term survival is the goal\". But if long-term survival really were a valid criterion, that would imply that the Inuit have been more successful than, say, the imperial Romans, because the Inuit are still here. </p> <p>Fernandez-Armesto's definition of what sort of behaviour constitutes \"civilizing\" an environment becomes so loose at times - just eating bits of it and constructing ramshackle shelters seems to be enough - that it could accommodate badgers, nest-building birds and termites just as well as it does humans. Stretch the word that thinly and it becomes useless. Some part of him seems to recognise the explanatory poverty of his thesis, for he regularly has recourse to \"civilization\" and its cognates in their old senses, lapsing into the usage he has derided: specifically, city-building societies with complex political cultures. </p> <p> Civilizations, though stuffed with what ought to be fascinating historical facts and comparisons, is the sheerest drudgery to read, because Fernandez-Armesto only rarely remembers what he is supposed to be arguing and instead indulges in reams of irrelevant armchair tourism and purple-hued narration. Were his theory a coherent and useful one, in fact, he would have been able to write a much shorter book. The reader at least ought to be grateful that he thinks \"culture\" cannot explain anything (at least, about half the time he does; as with most of his sweeping statements, he denies it about as often as he asserts it), because his own swerves into that territory are quite shatteringly banal. \"Plato fancied himself as a political thinker,\" we are told facetiously; \"Confucius was part of a vibrant world of ideas\"; Romanticism is \"a scale of values which put emotion above reason\"; and Japanese religion \"surely represent[s] the way human minds work more typically than westerners of the present generations\". What on God's sweet earth can that mean? </p> <p>Oddly, for all his carefully burnished self-image as a pioneering, multicultural, iconoclastic historian, Fernandez-Armesto's prose is that of a parodic 19th-century buffer, an Anglophile gentleman amateur who congratulates himself on having written his book \"in something of a frenzy\" informed by \"no mature deliberation\", who rails constantly against the \"gimcrack rubbish\" of newfangled inventions such as the electronic watch and (I kid you not) the zippered fly, and who observes the dusty gleam of ancient societies with a patronising inverted snobbery, excusing what was violent, brutish and - yes - uncivilized about them. </p> <p> Civilizations is, finally, a useful book in one way only: it defines the sensible limits of multiculturalism by overstepping them. Fernandez-Armesto is of course right to emphasise that modern western civilization is not the historically privileged summit of human evolution, but to doubt that it is in every way better than a superstitious ancient culture of South America that regularly sacrificed newborn babies is the most irrational cant of all.</p>",
  "<p>Raymond Illingworth always said Chalkie could bat. It is six years since Craig White first came into the England side as one of his \"brave little Yorkie\" prospects. He scored a half-century in his second Test and then, in a career that has been on and off more times than the indicators on a car in a local traffic jam, has scarcely scored a run for England since. </p> <p>Until yesterday that is. On a pitch made for spending the day at the crease White, who came in briefly the previous evening, thought it would be a felony not to take advantage of it. He batted for another four hours, played faultlessly overall, carefully at the start, impeccably against the Patron's XI spin attack and thunderously towards the end when he moved towards his hundred with panache. He was finally caught at the wicket, swishing vigorously, for 120. </p> <p>In all there were 14 fours and two sixes. One glorious three-ball passage of play that raced him into the 90s saw him drive raspingly straight, through the covers for another boundary and then slide into a lofted off-drive that cleared the boundary fencing and bounced around the concrete terracing. It was as good a shot as any played this tour. </p> <p>It was, of course, his first hundred in England colours but also his first in any cricket for two years. His bowling, high pace and with wicked use of reverse swing, emerged as the revelation of last season but otherwise these have been lean times. </p> <p>Having averaged fewer than 20 in first-class cricket in 1999, he suffered a worrying blackout early last summer and played only nine innings for Yorkshire and England. Yesterday's score, made on the back of successive innings of 0, 0 and 0 not out in the recent one-day series, exceeded his summer's aggregate by 20. </p> <p>Now, with new competition for a Test bowling place alongside Darren Gough and Andy Caddick if a spinner is chosen, White has done his cause no harm, slipping ahead of Dominic Cork. Good on him for that. It was an example - not followed by Mike Atherton on Thursday nor Graeme Hick, unusually, yesterday - of someone recognising a good thing when he saw it. </p> <p>\"I have struggled,\" he said afterwards.\" I've been concentrating on my bowling, I think, and worked hard at that to get it reasonably right but the batting has tailed off. I just wanted to spend a bit of time in the middle. If I batted for the first three hours , I thought it might come back to me and that's what I did. The pitch was so good that I said 'I've got to make the most of this' and I set my stall out to bat for most of the day. It helped me that the opposition said a few words to me when I first went in. They thought I was the nightwatchman. That spurred me on.\" </p> <p>White shared in partnerships of 83 for both the sixth wicket and the eighth, first with Paul Nixon, who made 31 in his first England innings without looking convincing against the spin, then with Ashley Giles, who looked more confident in making 39 before he was lbw. White had another of 44 for the ninth with Ian Salisbury. </p> <p>It saw England to 433 all out, a lead on first innnings of 196, which the Patron's XI had reduced by 49 at the close for the loss of Imran Abbas, caught at the wicket off Ian Salisbury. The spinners should hold the key to an England victory today, though there would be a further opportunity for Matthew Hoggard and Cork to exploit the dewfall first thing. </p> <p>At the start of play it had seemed a certainty that it would be Hick, 77 overnight, who would be celebrating a century. Instead, in the day's second over, he stretched high and far to reach a fastish longhop from Mohammad Sami, and succeeded only in toe-ending it to first slip. </p> <p>His next few hours would have been spent with his backside in an ice bucket to soothe the bruises where he surely kicked himself.</p>",
  "<p>Let's see if we have got this right. Precisely when Sven-Goran Eriksson takes over the England team depends on Lazio's forthcoming results in Serie A and the Champions League. </p> <p>So long as Lazio keep winning, the arrival of the first foreigner to run the nation's football team will be delayed until after Eriksson's present contract expires next summer. Two or three defeats in a row, however, and the Swedish technocrat will be here before the month is out. </p> <p>Against that, the better Lazio do the less chance there will be of Eriksson taking anything more than a temporary interest in England's World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania in March. The Football Association, then, is gambling on Eriksson failing in Rome in the short term so that England's chances will be improved in the long. </p> <p>Meanwhile Peter Taylor and Steve McClaren - remember them ? - will take England to Turin for a friendly against Italy on Wednesday week. Highly convenient this. Eriksson can pop in to say hello without being accused of taking his eye off the ball at Lazio. </p> <p>At the same time Tord Grip, Eriksson's assistant at Lazio but now a sort of John the Baptist with the FA, preparing the way for the master's coming, will be compiling a dossier on all things English so that, when Eriksson does take over, he will know his Arsenal from his Middlesbro'. </p> <p>Thus for the moment England are being run by two casuals whom the FA intends retaining as part-time assistants in the new regime even though Eriksson will obviously regard Grip as his full-time right-hand man. </p> <p>The three months between the Italy game and the friendly against Spain at Villa Park on February 27 are unlikely to quell speculation about where all this is leading. </p> <p>At least nobody can accuse Adam Crozier, the bright young thing appointed by the FA as chief executive, of pusillanimity. Crozier is prepared to pay the new coach \u00a310m in the hope that he will build an England team capable of winning the 2006 World Cup, and it seems reasonably safe to assume that Eriksson will prove a better investment than than did the abortive \u00a310m campaign to host the same tournament. </p> <p>Like all good establishment figures Crozier has wasted little time in distancing the upcoming new order from its immediate predecessor by implying, mildly though significantly, that under Kevin Keegan all was not well in Palookaville. </p> <p>Crozier thinks the players could be closer together and, remembering the absence of a defensive wall which might have stopped Dietmar Hamann scoring Germany's winning goal at Wembley last month, he might have a point. </p> <p>Eriksson has already spoken about the need for collectivism and teams thinking with one mind. It seems, therefore, that England will be all the better for some Swedish bondage . . . sorry, bonding. </p> <p>Since controversy, conflict and confrontation are manna for the media Crozier's words have quickly been taken to assume that rifts in the squad developed during Keegan's short reign: between Liverpool and Manchester United cliques, between those who were in the card school and those who thought that a trump was a bottle blonde with a thick accent. </p> <p>Well, at least this makes a change from seeing schisms between those who consulted the previous England coach's faith healer and those who believed they had joined the Moonies. </p> <p>But did not Keegan get the England job largely because he was to football teams what Ralph Reader was to Gang Shows ? </p> <p>Maybe Keegan's England did not exactly ride along on the crest of the wave but up to and including that first 18 minutes against Portugal in Eindhoven this summer they did appear to be pulling in roughly the same direction. </p> <p>Keegan failed in Euro 2000 not because the personalities in his team were in conflict but because the football they played had all the harmony of Les Dawson at the piano. </p> <p>The reality, of course, is that every sporting team in history, football or otherwise, has had its rows and factions but only when the results start to go badly wrong do these begin to surface. No one will realise this more than Eriksson, an old hand at the Italian game where dressing-room infighting can be as entertaining as the Serie A itself. </p> <p>It is on the field where morale thrives or falters. At the start of the 1970 World Cup in Mexico a furious row broke out in the Italian camp when Gianni Rivera declared that he, and not Sandro Mazzola, should be playing in the opening match. It took the president of the Italian federation, Artemio Franchi, to sort things out, yet Italy went on to reach the final. </p> <p>Before the 1982 World Cup two of France's leading players were involved in an eternal triangle, which is never calculated to strengthen dressing room bonhomie, but still emerged as the best side in that tournament after Brazil and outplayed West Germany in the semi-finals before going out on penalties. </p> <p>For England's sake it is to be hoped that Eriksson re-establishes a sense of togetherness. But that will happen only once he starts winning games. </p> <p>Results and results alone are what matter and it is on these, not the mood in the dressing room, that he will be judged.</p>"
