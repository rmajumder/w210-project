  "The Middle East is lurching towards war. Today's ghastly events in Ramallah, where three captured Israeli soldiers were butchered by a lynch mob, and the subsequent massive retaliatory attacks on Palestinian targets, have plunged the region into its deepest gloom since the darkest days of the intifada. <p>Thirteen years ago, when the Palestinian uprising erupted, Israeli forces were in full control of the occupied territories. Now, most of the Gaza strip and large chunks of the West Bank are controlled by Yasser Arafat's motley forces. </p> <p>It is no match, as the world has seen this afternoon. On the one hand, a few hundred Kalashnikov rifles; on the other, the region's most formidable military machine. And yet that is not the end of the matter. The assault helicopters which smashed Arafat's headquarters in Gaza and in Ramallah were spelling out Israel's constant message to its neighbours: harm us, and you will pay dearly. </p> <p>The direst danger now is that Israel may attempt to re-impose its military occupation of the Palestinian territories. That would outrage Arab opinion throughout the region, and could even spark a wider conflagration. </p> <p>Israeli public opinion is also inflamed. The lynch mob which killed the three soldiers in Ramallah scraped the rawest nerve in Israel's national psyche. The brutal murders will inevitably raise mortal fears for the Israeli soldiers now being held captive by Hizbullah guerrillas in south Lebanon. </p> <p>There is no shortage of shrill calls for the Israeli army once more to cross the Lebanese border. War is no longer an abstract threat. Both Israelis and Palestinians are saying it is already a fact. Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, Israel's deputy prime minister, has said that the peace process \"is now dead\". Saeb Erakat, a senior Palestinian negotiator, has given an extraordinary interview to BBC Radio Five Live, passionately appealing for international intervention to halt the Israeli retaliation. </p> <p>He will not get his wish. The international community is not going to get directly involved. And yet the world will not sit idly by. It cannot, with fears of a general regional conflagration already sending oil prices soaring, and causing chaos on stock markets around the world. </p> <p>The best and most immediate hope for restoring sanity is US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is in the region struggling to prevent the final disintegration of the peace process. Already, she has appealed to Israel to stop its military onslaught, using unusually direct language. There is as yet no sign that Israel is listening, let alone complying. </p> <p>This is a conflict in which both sides passionately believe they are the victims. The Palestinians talk of Israel's brutal military machine, and complain about the USA's unquestioning support for the Jewish state. The Israelis talk of being a tiny threatened enclave in a hostile region. </p> <p>Both are right, of course. That is why there is such an urgent need for deeds of war to be replaced by talk of peace. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/\">Special report: Israel and the Middle East</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.israel.org/gov\" target=\"_new\">Government of Israel</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.jpost.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.haaretzdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Ha'aretz</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.net\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/is.html\" target=\"_new\">CIA factbook on Israel</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/gz.html\" target=\"_new\">CIA factbook on the Gaza strip</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/we.html\" target=\"_new\">CIA factbook on the West Bank</a> </p>",
  "Jack Straw, the home secretary, yesterday blamed the lack of patriotism of the political left for allowing the modern British identity to be seen as \"narrow, exclusionary and conservative\". <p>Mr Straw declared himself proud to be British and insisted that he did not accept the arguments of some on the liberal left or the nationalist right that the idea of Britain as a cohesive nation was dead. The existence of people happy to be known as \"black British or Chinese British\" demonstrated that \"Britishness\" had a future. </p> <p>The modern challenge now, said Mr Straw, was to meld the enormous range of races, accents and attitudes in the country into a single shared identity. \"This is made even more difficult by the way those on the left turned their backs on the concept of patriotism and left the field to those on the far right,\" the home secretary said. </p> <p>He was speaking at the launch of the controversial report of the commission on the future of multi-ethnic Britain, which has put a question mark against the future use of the term \"British\" because it has racial connotations of \"white colonialism\". It calls for a formal declaration that Britain is a multicultural society, and it has been accused of wanting to rewrite British history. </p> <p>Mr Straw said that while he welcomed some of the recommendations of the Runny mede Trust sponsored commission, which was chaired by the Labour peer and political scientist Lord Parekh, he parted company with the report over its view of Britishness. \"Unlike the Runnymede Trust, I firmly believe there is a future for Britain and a future for Britishness.\" </p> <p>Mr Straw said George Orwell's observation 50 years ago that in leftwing circles it was felt that there was something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman still applied to day. \"Orwell wrote that 'it is unquestionably true that almost any English intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during God Save the King than of stealing from the poor box'. </p> <p>\"Given the tendency of some of the left to wash their hands of the whole notion of nationhood, it is perhaps not surprising that some people's perception of Englishness and Britishness became a narrow, exclusionary, conservative one. That's a view of British ness that I don't recognise. We all benefit, economically and socially, from our diversity and difference. We should be celebrating that, not bemoaning it.\" </p> <p>Lord Parekh insisted that his commission wanted to reform and redefine what it means to be British. \"We do not denigrate British history. There is a very important role for a common national culture and a common civic nationality,\" he said. \"But we are requesting that this common culture needs to be discussed and renegotiated. It does not imply that it is not a coherent idea.\" </p> <p>Lord Parekh said that too often minority ethnic groups were seen at best as \"welcome tenants\" and not as common owners of the country. </p> <p>\"The British national identity should be so defined that we all feel comfortable with it and we all feel proud to be British,\" he said. </p> <p>The wide-ranging report is the biggest review of British identity and racial equality since Labour came to power three years ago. Its recommendations include scrapping the asylum voucher and dispersal system and setting up a human rights commission. </p> <p>\u0095 The Future of Multi-ethnic Britain, The Parekh Report, Profile Books, \u00a310.99</p>",
  "Thirty years ago, the argument of the British right was that coloured immigration, as they called it, was going to destroy the British way of life. Enoch Powell prophesied that whole areas of the country would soon be unrecognisable, as the proportion of non-white faces grew by compound accumulation. In 1978, as Conservative leader and candidate for prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, promised to stop the \"swamping\" of the country by an \"influx\" of people who did not ethnically belong here. The critique of the right was that far too many non-Brits were being let in, and would give birth to far too many offspring who would change Britain for ever. <p>It was an inflammatory argument, which had a pervasive effect on the way race was dealt with by politicians of all parties. However, it has now apparently changed. The right's response to the new report by the Commission on the Future of Multi-ethnic Britain starts from the opposite premise. The commission's proposal that historic concepts of Britishness deserve rethinking in 2000 meets a tirade of anger based on the claim that there are not enough blacks and Asians here to justify any such exercise. </p> <p>Whites, it is said, are the majority: about 53m out of 57m. So any recognition that this is a multi-ethnic society, let alone that Britishness needs to encompass wider definitions than hitherto, is an affront to the white majority: \"sub-Marxist gibberish\" (Daily Telegraph), \"an insult to history and our intelligence\" (Daily Mail). The same people who once said you were being swamped, and generated decades of journalism playing to such images, now say that nothing has changed after all and that anyone who suggests otherwise must come from the Josef Goebbels academy of political correctness. </p> <p>Besides being startlingly contradictory, each of these positions lacks a certain basis in fact. The Powellite prophecy did not come true. By this time, had he been correct, there would be about 5m more non-white British than in fact there are. Such a large error should caution us against the propensity of the right to allow paranoid hallucination to invade objectivity in these matters. And so it proves with their reaction to Lord Parekh's commission. They seem to regard the fact that there are now nearly 4m British who are not white, as well as millions more who are not Anglo-Saxon, as so unimportant, and yet so strangely menacing, that it is better left unaddressed by intellectual inquiry. </p> <p>The commission was foolish to leave itself open to the charge that it wants to abolish \"Britain\". Its report does not say that, but makes insinuations about the meaning of Britain and British history that could only be provocative. They seem silly anyway. Far from \"Britain\" needing to be replaced by something else, it strikes me as a label that gains new life from the very non-white communities that Lord Parekh says have made it anachronistic. Properly understood, Britain provides a catch-all identity for every segment of this multi-ethnic country. Though its political origins may be undone by the separation of Scotland from England, its descriptive inclusiveness can hardly be challenged. </p> <p>But it does need to be inclusive. That is all the Parekh commission is really saying. Defenders of Britain's racial record insist that there is no doubt about such inclusiveness. Parekh surveys the field and raises questions that suggest otherwise. And in doing so it makes its own proposal for an historic evolution. Whereas the right is fixated by the past, the left urges a new kind of focus on the future. </p> <p> At the time Enoch Powell spoke, the emphasis of public policy was on racial integration. It was against the Wilson government's legislative efforts in that field that Powell proffered his poisonous vision of the rivers of urban Britain foaming with blood. The governing ethos tended to favour the idea of assimilation of immigrant minorities into the host community, unimpeded by racial penalties. As home secretary, Roy Jenkins made a famous speech broadening the objective to include diversity and tolerance. But essentially the goal was to make available to all who entered this country access to British rights and standards, not to mention jobs and housing: to permit everyone to conform to a rather narrow, if admirable and well-defended, model of Britishness. </p> <p>Many immigrants and their British-born children did so. Some could be heard denouncing Lord Parekh yesterday. But many others found that the model did not fit their lives. It is much easier for German migrants to become fully American than for, say, Pakistani Muslims to fit into a British legal regime that cannot cope with religious differences. The integrationist model has its limits. It has little to say about social, as distinct from legal, exclusion or the interlinking of social deprivation with racial prejudice which must surely preoccupy any keen observer of the state of Britain today. </p> <p>The Parekh commission, by characterising Britain as a community of communities, offers a broader model than mere assimilation. It has scouted out the land the Daily Telegraph never visits, and hoisted some storm cones. It wants Britain to celebrate her variety, and understand how differences as well as conformity need to be accommodated in schools, in the police, in politics, in culture, in the whole range of public life. It makes some substantial proposals, as such surveys must, which are of variable quality but deserve serious discussion. </p> <p>The hysteria with which the report has been greeted does not bode well for such discussion. But it throws a revealing light on these frightened spokesmen for the old canons of Britishness. They can barely contain their rage at the notion of the national identity, along with its hierarchy of historic icons, perhaps needing to be updated. They evidently do not understand what it means to feel excluded: don't feel the individual pain, don't reflect on the social consequences. Their anguished frenzy makes a contrast with the measured, confident and adult tone of the commission, which is a far cry from the ethnic whingeing of 20 years ago. Who, one wonders, are the real inheritors of British tolerance and cool common sense here? </p> <p>The most potent recent display of our island nationalism took place at Wembley last Saturday. This is what Englishness - which is synonymous, for the Telegraph and Mail, with Britishness - has sunk to. Ten thousand voices roared anti-German war taunts, and drowned out the other side's national anthem. Richard Williams reported \"a mood of such depravity as to make one wonder exactly what, in far wider terms, the English think they are doing with themselves\". </p> <p>I wasn't there, and can't prove it. But would anyone bet that more than 1% of that yobbish multitude was of Asian or Caribbean origin? Finding the only way to proclaim their Britishness by screaming obscenities at Germans? They may not always support England at cricket. But they seem to know better than many Anglo-Saxons what should be meant by being British. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>RADIO TIMES</strong></p> <p>How much do you love u&gt;direct sports, the capital-letter-less capitalists who snaffled up the live rights to last night's World Cup match between Finland and England and then asked everyone to pay to watch it? Very much? Well, you must love staring at boxes with the words \"Finland v England \u00a37.99 please insert your smartcard\" in them, then. Unlike the Fiver, for example, who, upon being presented with such a box for the duration of the whole game, was forced to smash the television into sharp Jari Litmanen-shaped pieces. Before saying sorry to Granny Fiver, whose telly we had been watching.</p> <p>It turns out that the Fiver was only one of many customers experiencing \"technical difficulties\" such as frozen or blank screens. According to u&gt;direct, anyone who subscribed to the \"event\" through the Sky \"platform\" would have had \"few\" problems. But any poor sod who chipped into the u&gt;coffers using some other digital provider was destined to suffer. Additionally, if you were rude enough to only pay through the nose just before the game began, and not several days in advance, then you may as well have flushed your money straight down the Swanee.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the whole affair was deemed to be a corking success by the folks at u&gt;. \"We did have one or two problems with isolated customers, mainly those who phoned very late and left it to the last minute to register,\" complained u&gt;ngrateful managing director Roger Hall. \"I don't want to pass the buck,\" he passed the buck, \"but in the same way that u&gt;direct wouldn't have been responsible for something going wrong on the BBC last night, nor would we be responsible for something going wrong on another broadcast platform.\"</p> <p>Why Hall should be at pains to shift the blame onto \"another broadcast platform\" is beyond us, especially when an ONdigital spokesperson insisted he was \"not aware\" of any problems at all with his company's service. The Fiver is currently very confused, but once we've read the statements from both companies again - no apology from either, you'll notice - we're sure we'll discover that missing the whole match was our own silly fault.</p> <p><strong>STEVE TOASTS COAST POST</strong></p> <p>Anything Southampton can do, bitter south coast rivals Portsmouth can do too. Apart from retaining top-flight status, that is, but now is not the time to start a row. Anyway, the First Division club have taken their neighbours lead in appointing a brand new manager while moving the present one aside for personal reasons. \"Dave Jones and Glenn Hoddle? We'll give you Dave Jones and Glenn Hoddle!\" you can almost imagine Pompey fans screaming at the folk they light-heartedly refer to as scummers.</p> <p>The similarities between the two situations are uncanny: Dell boss Jones was ousted from his post so he could defend himself in the courts, while Pompey boss Tony Pulis has been granted leave of absence on full pay to \"concentrate on his forthcoming court case with Gillingham FC\"; the reason for Jones's dismissal was widely regarded as an excuse to jettison him for performances on the pitch - chairman Milan Mandaric has relieved Pulis of his duties after a run of two wins in 11 league games; and just as Saints called up a world-class footballing genius to take over, so Pompey have appointed Steve Claridge.</p> <p>\"It's a dream come true!\" bubbled the Portsmouth-born striker. \"It's something I've always dreamed about since I was a kid and I love this club,\" he continued, drinking in the heady atmosphere. But although 34-year-old Claridge was giddy with delight, he was well aware of how sobering the task ahead will be. \"It's great,\" he toasted, \"but I've got to make it work. I'm under no illusions about how hard it will be.\" We wish you well, Steve - after all, Pompey have taken one hell of a gamble on you.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"My job is available\" - Norway coach Nils Johan Semb offers to resign following his side's 1-0 home defeat by Ukraine.

But perhaps Leicester's cockney manager is being too 'bright and breezy' (easy) about dealing with his 'Allan Border' (out-of-order) striker. Because when Southend boss David Webb tried to 'shovel and pick' (nick) Collymore, it was Taylor who warned him off!</p> <p>\"Peter rang me last week to wish me good luck with Southend and I took the opportunity to ask him about Stan,\" revealed Webb, using a disappointing lack of London slang. \"But he told me Stan wanted to move abroad and I wouldn't want him because of his problems.\" Now usually that would be the end of the matter, but Webb seems strangely keen to get his man - albeit with one or two provisos.</p> <p>\"I thought it would be nice to get him back at Roots Hall for the fans if Leicester would be willing to pay his wages,\" said the Shrimpers boss, sheepishly forgetting to mention that Stan 'earns' \u00a313,000 a week. \"He's still available for transfer as I got a circular from Leicester the other day, and you never know what might happen,\" he chirped with a wanton disregard for the amount of baggage Stan carries with him. \"The seeds have been sown now,\" he added, blissfully unaware that jellied eels, a pier and Third-Division football are unlikely to satisfy Collymore's ego - let alone his stomach.</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Newcastle are poised to sign Honduran defender Milton Jocon Reyes, according to Teamtalk.

  "<p>Scientists who borrowed a leaf from the gardening manuals have confirmed that the oceans can bloom with trillions of tiny plants - if someone sprinkles a little mineral fertiliser first. </p> <p>More importantly, the phytoplankton - the tiny green plants - can soak up huge quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, provided they have enough iron in the oceanic equivalent of topsoil. </p> <p>An international team of scientists reports in Nature today that they tipped more than three tons of dissolved iron into a 50 square kilometre patch of sea off Antarctica. Over the next two weeks they measured the levels of dissolved carbon dioxide in the surface waters and noted that it had fallen by 10% as the algae began to bloom. They calculated that 1,000 tons of carbon had been taken up by the plants. </p> <p>When the scientists checked satellite images six weeks later, their original 50km square \"lawn\" had been stretched by ocean currents to a ribbon more than 150km long. </p> <p>All plants need water, and carbon and nitrogen from the air, to grow. But they also need tiny quantities of other nutrients to make this growth possible. In 1990, an American oceanographer called John Martin argued that the reason the oceans weren't teeming with plant life was a shortage of iron. </p> <p>In 1993, Andrew Watson of the University of East Anglia began a series of tests. The latest voyage of the \"Soiree\" team - Soiree stands for southern ocean iron release experiment - confirmed that the hypothesis was as true for near freezing oceans as for tropical ones. </p> <p>But, Prof Watson warned, the experiment did not offer a solution to the problem of global warming. </p> <p>Ever since the first alarms about the greenhouse effect there have been hopes of a \"technical fix\". But, he said, the process could only take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a certain rate. The value of the experiment lay in what it could reveal about the history of the earth during the last 400,000 years. </p> <p>\"The changes we saw after adding the iron may well explain past changes in the earth's carbon dioxide levels during and at the end of the ice ages. It is evident that this is a driver for climate change. We know that there was a far higher flux of iron in the atmospheric dust to the oceans in glacial times. Our study indicates this was responsible for about half of the big change in atmospheric carbon dioxide that occurred then,\" he said.</p>",
  "<b>The Prime Minister: The Office and Its Holders since 1945 by Peter Hennessy. </b>Allen Lane, 686 pp., \u00a325, 5 October, 0 713 99340 5 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501839233,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> <p> Peter Hennessy's new book hasn't persuaded me that its central preoccupation, the current dispute over prime ministerial power and its extent, is not sterile and, indeed, rather boring - yet it is a splendid read. The truth is that the Westminster system is quite inadequately democratic and transparent, and Hennessy is, if anything, too respectful and conventional in his proposals about how the office might be reformed. Party discipline, a weak parliament, quasi-presidential power, great secrecy and the fact that the PM, invariably gifted with a safe seat, is insulated from direct electoral pressure all mean that the system is just not accountable enough. The most disappointing part of Blair's constitutional reforms is that he hasn't faced up to the problems of the central edifice itself. There is no separation of powers, there are far too many MPs, secrecy makes it much too easy to hoodwink parliament and the public, the second chamber remains a patronage-based absurdity and so on. </p> <p> What makes the book so riveting to read is, on the one hand, the thoroughness of Hennessy's examination of the documents now open on pre-1970 administrations, combined with a great many interviews and inquiries of his own, and, on the other, his investigation of the PM's role in military and intelligence affairs. There is, however, a sharp cut-off point. What he has to say about administrations up to 1964 is fresh and fascinating; Wilson's administration of 1964-70 was so voluminously covered by press leaks at the time and by endless diaries and memoirs soon afterwards that the official documents have nothing new to tell us, and the Public Record Office is still closed for the administrations after that, so the quality and interest of the coverage fall sharply away. You read the chapters dealing with the period up to 1964 with bated breath and the ones thereafter with a yawn that becomes progressively harder to stifle as you reach the age of Major and Blair. </p> <p> The prime minister alone, as Hennessy reminds us, can activate the codes for a nuclear strike. The only one to authorise such a strike was Churchill: the 1943 Quebec Agreement meant that he had to give the go-ahead for Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Repeated attempts were made to get him to take the decision to cabinet, whose combined policy committee supported him, but still he refused. The framework for everything that followed was set by Attlee: he was the one who had to face the cold war, who authorised the building of a British atom bomb and drew up detailed preparations for world war three. The chiefs of staff, fearing an imminent Soviet attack, threatened their collective resignation in order to force him to keep open mediterranean and Middle East bases from which the RAF could bomb the USSR. But Major Attlee had fought at Gallipoli and was correspondingly sceptical about what generals had to say, favouring the MI6 view that the Soviet Union would not risk a major war until at least the mid-1950s. Yet by 1949 Attlee's inner group of ministers had launched a programme of subversive activities behind the iron curtain and approved war plans that included censorship, civil defence and internment camps on the Isle of Man. </p> <p> Even at this distance one trembles at the description of Churchill's return to office in 1951. It was a bizarre scene: he would take a late breakfast in bed with cold grouse or partridge and a whisky and soda. Lunch would follow with \"enough champagne and brandy... to incapacitate any lesser man\", as his private secretary John Colville put it. He would talk to ministers with Toby, his budgie, alighting (and sometimes doing more than that) on their heads. He had frequent sleeps. His method of dealing with crises, he explained, was to \"turn out the light, say 'bugger everyone,' and go to sleep\". He thought he could run the cabinet as if the war were still on, had a stroke (which was hushed up), and became increasingly senile. \"Churchill is now often speechless in Cabinet; alternatively, he rambles about nothing,\" Macmillan wrote in 1954. \"Sometimes he looks as if he is going to have another stroke... He was always an egoist, but a magnanimous one. Now he has become almost a monomaniac.\" It was into these unreliable hands that the first British atomic bomb was delivered in November 1953 - \"an extraordinary thing\", as Hennessy points out, \"for a man who had fought at Omdurman in 1898\". When, in July 1954, he revealed to the Cabinet that a mere committee had, several months before, taken the decision to build an H-bomb, the angry ministers walked out. </p> <p> Above all, Churchill clung to office. He despised Anthony Eden, his heir apparent, who, he said, had \"gone native\" among the \"shuffling scuttlers\" at the foreign office. The last of the Yalta Big Three, he was determined to end the cold war by personal diplomacy. The cabinet was horrified to discover that, returning from the US by ship, he had shot off a sheaf of telegrams to the new (post-Stalin) Soviet leadership, causing Lord Salisbury to threaten resignation for the umpteenth time. But it was all foolish and in vain. When he heard he'd won the Nobel Prize (in 1953, for his war memoirs) he became tremendously excited until told that it was for literature: \"His face fell. He'd wanted the Nobel Peace Prize.\" He ran the government in a wholly self-indulgent manner, and had little idea about peacetime problems, saying, for example, of his time as chancellor under Baldwin: \"I was chancellor of the exchequer... for five years and... I never understood it.\" Not long before leaving office he suggested to the cabinet that, in the face of increasing \"coloured immigration\", a good campaign slogan would be 'Keep England White'. Somehow he staggered through four years in this way, confiding to Colville on his last night at No 10: \"I don't believe Anthony can do it.\" </p> <p> Given that Churchill's opinion was quite widely shared, it seems surprising now that Eden was allowed to succeed. Lord Swinton had already told Churchill that \"anybody would be better than Anthony\" - who \"would make the worst prime minister since Lord North\". \"But,\" Swinton added, \"you announced him as your successor more than ten years ago.\"''I think it was a great mistake,' Churchill conceded. Within a short time of Eden's accession, the Russians were threatening to bombard the country with rockets as a result of a crisis he had insisted on provoking. </p> <p> Eden was an impossible fusser, pestering ministers with as many as twenty notes a day and ringing them up at every turn: Selwyn Lloyd had to endure thirty calls over the Christmas weekend of 1955. On top of this he had a violent temper. Civil servants were scared of taking issues to him: \"they knew it would worry him and cause an explosion. Always at the back of everything was the fear that he would lose his temper and we should be sworn at.\" He raged against his ministers, against journalists, against the Americans and against \"the Communists in the BBC\". Anthony Nutting, a junior minister at the Foreign Office, told Hennessy how, on the eve of Suez, Eden called him: </p> <p> \"The telephone rang and a voice down the other end said: 'It's me.' I didn't quite realise who 'me' was for a moment. However, he gave the show away very quickly by starting to scream at me. 'What is all this poppycock you've sent me about isolating Nasser and neutralising Nasser? Why can't you get it into your head I want the man destroyed?' I said: 'OK. You get rid of Nasser, what are you going to put in his place?' 'I don't want anybody,' he said. I said: 'Well, there'll be anarchy and chaos in Egypt.' 'I don't care if there's anarchy and chaos in Egypt. Let there be anarchy and chaos in Egypt. I just want to get rid of Nasser.'\" </p> <p> Everything that followed - the crazy invasion, ignoring Eisenhower's strong warnings against it, deceiving the cabinet, lying to parliament and the ultimate d*nouement - was inevitable: the Government was in the hands of a demented narcissist. The greatest criticism of the cabinet system in the entire period under review is that no one acted to stop a man who was clearly out of control, completely lacking in judgment - and in charge of a nuclear arsenal. </p> <p> Britain being Britain, there was a closing of ranks. Selwyn Lloyd lied like a trooper throughout the rest of his political life about his collusion with the French and Israelis, which didn't prevent him being hailed as a great statesman; and for years on end ministers stoutly denied that US pressure or the run on sterling had anything to do with the retreat from Suez. Hennessy did well to get Douglas-Home - many years later - to give the game away: </p> <p> \"What really turned the scale and made the chancellor... so terribly anxious was the American action in putting the Sixth Fleet alongside us in the mediterranean, for all the world to see, and therefore announcing in effect that America was totally against us. And the effect on sterling as a result of that was catastrophic. It was the actual effect on sterling [that did it].\" </p> <p> The dramas that Hennessy reveals peak with Macmillan. It is nice to be reminded of the Supermac style. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, called on Macmillan to tell him that whatever he did, he must not appoint Michael Ramsey as his successor, adding that he knew Ramsey well, had indeed been his headmaster at Repton. \"Thank you, Your Grace, for your kind advice,\" Macmillan replied. \"You may have been Dr Ramsey's headmaster, but you were not mine.\" Some years later, of the Kentish boy, Ted Heath: \"Hengist and Horsa were very dull people. Now, as you know, they colonised Kent; consequently the people of Kent have ever since been very slightly - well, you know . . . Ted was an excellent chief whip . . . a first class staff officer, but no army commander.\" Mac pushed Concorde through by regaling his ministers with the story of his great-aunt's Daimler, which had travelled \"at the sensible speed of thirty miles an hour . . . Nowadays, alas, people had a mania for dashing around. But that being so Britain ought to cater for this profitable modern eccentricity.\" Everyone was charmed, laughed, agreed, it was over in minutes. But Macmillan could also be morose, telling Woodrow Wyatt that his son Maurice \"was much nicer than me. I was always a shit. Maurice wouldn't be one so that's why he didn't get on in politics like me.\" </p> <p> The great drama of Macmillan's premiership - he was the first to have thermonuclear weapons at his disposal - was the Cuban missile crisis. The previous year the V-bomber force (the Victors, Vulcans and Valiants) had received a new set of procedures, counting down from Condition 5 (peace) to 1 (placing 25 per cent of the bomber force at five minutes' readiness). As the tension increased in October 1962 the force was moved to Condition 3. The plan was to annihilate thirty to forty Soviet cities with an assumed 16 million casualties: big cities like Moscow and Leningrad would get two or three H-bombs each. Nearly half the V-bombers were loaded with bombs and made ready, as were 59 Thor missiles, all with nuclear warheads. It seems likely that Air Marshal Cross took the initiative to increase the bombers' readiness to a mere 15 minutes from take-off. The pilots and crews slept on camp-beds next to the planes and all switches were set to allow a rapid engine start; they believed they would be able to take off in under 8 minutes. The weekend of 27-28 October - the worst of Macmillan's life - was \"the defining moment of the postwar period in nuclear terms\". </p> <p> It is intriguing to read of the great nuclear shelter for VIPs under the Cotswolds, to learn that the royal yacht Britannia was a fully fledged command and control centre with washdown facilities to deal with nuclear fallout, but the most striking thing is that neither the public nor parliament was ever told how close the country was to nuclear war. We didn't know that American action in the Caribbean would automatically lead to the V-bombers being fitted with Yellow Sun Mk IIs (as the H-bombs were called, though we weren't even told that at the time) and dispersed round the country ready to attack - and therefore didn't know how very close we came to the nightmare of Dr Strangelove. And, of course, there would have been no nonsense about alerting the public about what was up by declaring war. As Hennessy points out, the last time Britain declared war was against Siam in 1942: every war since - Korea, the Falklands, endless colonial conflicts, the Gulf, Kosovo - has been fought without parliament getting a chance to agree to it. </p> <p> Fast forward to April 1982: Macmillan \"doing his old man act\" visits Mrs Thatcher as the Falklands War escalates. She had cleared all the furniture away ready to receive a big deputation of backbenchers that evening. Mac, seeing the empty space, jumped to conclusions about the family silver. \"You've sold it all off, I suppose.\" He had just one question about the Argentinians: \"Have they got the Bomb?\" Assured they didn't, he talked of administrative matters and left with a mixture of admiration for her backbone mixed with disdain for her lack of background: \"she should have had more... knowledge - at least 150 years, perhaps 500 years, of the history of the country concerned.\" The idea of Mrs Thatcher having a deep appreciation of Argentinian history is almost comic and says more about the scholarly Macmillan than it does about her. Mrs Thatcher recalled how, as a young MP, she had heard Macmillan say that, not having a department of their own to run, prime ministers had a lot of time for reading. He recommended Disraeli and Trollope: indeed, he liked to talk of \"going to bed with a Trollope\". Mrs Thatcher \"sometimes wondered if he was joking\". </p> <p> Douglas-Home's premiership still has some old world charm. He described his time as prime minister as \"a terrible intrusion into one's private life\". His friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter told how Home believed government would be best carried out by 12 upper class families, of which nine should be Scottish. Douglas-Home told Dominic Harrod that he'd had a letter from Harrod's father, the economist, \"about inflation... or deflation - or something\". The most intriguing revelation here is that, had he won the 1964 election, he would have recalled Enoch Powell to the cabinet with a brief to reform Whitehall. This would doubtless have produced a historic slaughter, the Tiber foaming with much blood, but it's unlikely that even Powell would have won that one. Almost all ministers, and prime ministers especially, become great admirers of the civil service over time - the exception being, as usual, Macmillan. \"Civil servants are really more dangerous when they are good,\" he once said. \"They are against the aristocracy; the successful businessman; and the adventurer... They are like the clergy in pre-Reformation times. It was against them rather than against any theological doctrine that our ancestors revolted.\" </p> <p> It isn't just the absence of documents that makes it so dispiriting to move from the incumbents of the early postwar period to Wilson and Callaghan, Major and Blair. Hennessy, while admitting that many of the early premiers often broke the rules of cabinet government, is almost at a loss confronted by Thatcher and has an even worse time with Blair. His notion that the system was somehow vindicated by the fact that Thatcher got her come-uppance in the end is not convincing: it took 11 years to happen, after all, and allowed a degree of monomania which, if the system worked, would have been checked long before. In fact, if it really worked it would not have accepted a drunken and senile Churchill for so long or allowed an unstable personality like Eden to take office. It is comforting to believe in the inevitability - and thus security - of collective responsibility and, ultimately, collective action, but more often than not it's a fiction. </p> <p> An American president is constrained, above all, by a written constitution and the separation of powers. The truth is that, lacking a formal set of restraints, a premier like Thatcher could and did play fast and loose with the system. She could, for example, declare that she intended \"to go on and on and on\", something no American president could do. Blair has carried presidentialism even further but there is something embarrassing and hollow about the whole business: at least Thatcher was using all that power to make huge changes. Why does Blair need to concentrate such power around him? The country is not at war, he's not ramming through Attlee-scale reforms and his majority is large enough for him to allow parliament a strong say and still know he'll win. At the end of the day, a great deal of this presidentialism is quite obviously smoke and mirrors, PR without content. Can academics like Anthony Giddens, who took \"the Third Way\" seriously, now refrain from blushing? British premiers are usually frauds when they philosophise. Attlee and Thatcher stand out as premiers because they inaugurated an age in their image and changed the terms of debate, but neither was a philosopher - Thatcher's pretensions in that regard were simply embarrassing. </p> <p> One is driven, ineluctably, to wonder about the sadly inverse nature of political leadership. When the American republic was young and the population still tiny, the Presidency produced Washington, Hamilton, Jackson, Jefferson and Lincoln. Two hundred years and two hundred million people further on, with everyone far better educated, richer and more sophisticated, it could only produce the likes of Nixon and Ford, Reagan and Clinton. </p> <p> Britain is the same: when the population was under five million it produced Walpole and the two Pitts. Later, still with a poorly educated population under thirty million, it produced Palmerston, Peel, Disraeli and Gladstone. After it reached fifty million - of far better educated people - it produced the likes of Wilson, Callaghan, Major and Blair. Some strange law of historical diminution is at work here. Even the monstres sacr\u00e9s like Churchill look wonderful by contrast. He might have helped France at one time, De Gaulle said of Churchill, but in truth he would always be France's opponent because \"within him breathes the soul of Pitt.\" As we look at our modern crop of leaders it is difficult to imagine that within them breathe even the souls of Ramsay MacDonald or Stanley Baldwin. </p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">LRB</a>.

  "<p>Half the cast of <strong> Coronation Street</strong> (ITV) were held hostage at gunpoint in Freshco last night. And they weren't the only ones. This episode was split into two - one early, one late - designed to hold the huge TV audience hostage all evening. </p> <p>Freshco is an unusual supermarket. It has many of the attributes of the Tardis - small outside but surprisingly capacious inside. It never has any customers but is stocked with the riches of the Indies. As the night wore on, Curly, the manager, provided a midnight feast for hostages and robbers from Freshco's bottomless stock. It was all rather jolly. There were fillet steaks cooked by Fred Elliot on disposable barbecues (\"You 'aven't lived, ah say you 'aven't lived, until you've 'ad one of my fillet steaks, medium rare, in a warm buttered roll.\") There was garden furniture to sit on, sticky-toffee-bubble-gum ice-cream for dessert, a game of bowls played with melons and, of course, yards of clothesline to tie up the guests. You don't see much clothesline in supermarkets these days, but it seems to sell well in Weatherfield. The same washing has been hanging out on the same clothesline in the Coronation Street titles since Ken Barlow was a fresh-faced lad. </p> <p>Ken Barlow, whose 40-year-long career has bottomed out as a trolley collector for Freshco, and Mike Baldwin, newly returned from a disastrous honeymoon with the rapacious Linda, were both held hostage. Ken and Mike are the Sooty and Sweep of Coronation Street, lifelong rivals who beguile the longueurs of soap life by seeing who can marry the most women. Mike is ahead by four to three. </p> <p>Dean, the young gunman, took against the pair of them and locked them in a cupboard all night. \"I don't know who's the biggest git, you or the cockney over there... Either way, you're both getting up my nose.\" You warmed to the lad. It was like Leo Amery calling out in the Commons: \"Speak for England, Arthur!\" Dean, you felt, was speaking for the nation. Locked in their cupboard, Ken and Mike passed the night counting their wives until they fell into an exhausted camaraderie. </p> <p>It is a great comfort in any hostage situation to remember the terrible people you might have had to spend the night with. Martin might have been there, bent into strange shapes from having to sleep on the sofa. Or Rita and her oleaginous paramour, Anthony, the theatre critic. I believe I could endure any siege provided Anthony were not there telling Rita she looked ravishing tonight, and Rita telling Anthony he certainly had a way with words. Before Rita flings her bonnet over the windmill, I must remind her of Wodehouse's opinion of theatre critics. They come out at night up to no good. </p> <p>Emma, Curly's girlfriend, who is the pride of the police armed response unit, has been preparing us for the worst for weeks now, with such reassurances as \"The chances of using a gun are pretty remote\" and \"The whole point of training is to minimise the danger\" and, of course, the old faithful \"People are just as likely to get hurt crossing the road.\" So we knew someone was for it. It was only a case of whom. I had a fiver on Frank, the frankly useless security guard, as it was his last day at Freshco anyway and his leaving card read rather pointedly: \"We're sorry to see you go. You'll be missed more than you know.\" </p> <p>Outside, wives were waiting three deep. Inside, Curly was coaxing Dean into giving him his gun. \"I just wanted a bit of cash,\" said Dean. \"Yes, I know,\" said Curly sadly. \"Just give me the gun and everything will be all right.\" Then, in a rattle of gunfire, Emma shot Dean dead and Curly's face settled into something like inconsolable sorrow. </p> <p>Let me introduce you to a writer. Jimmy Corkhill is now mad, a fact which seems to have gone unnoticed in <strong> Brookside</strong> (Channel 4), though his eyes look like Catherine wheels. He has, like many a loony before him, turned to the literary life and is now worrying his nice wife, Jackie, by reading the Blake aloud (not surprisingly, it's the bit about the invisible worm which seems to worry her most) and threatening to write a book. \"I'm writing me autobiography. It Explains Everything...\" he raves. \"I'll do it tomorrow.\" This is so true to life - particularly doing it tomorrow - that I have the highest hopes for Jimmy's life story, Bring Me Me Bow Of Burning Gold! Dedicated to Jackie, who probably had to bring it.</p>",
  "It is rich that a government which rode the wave of \"cool Britannia\" is now seriously considering a report which concludes that the word \"British\" has racist connotations (British tag is 'coded racism', October 11). A piece of languagedoes not have connotations. It is how we use it that counts. Change the underlying social practices and structures and the connotations of the word will change. It is naive to think that a government in some Orwellian frenzy can tell us how to speak and somehow this will create a more inclusive society. Language is far more complex then that. <p>Being truly proud about one's national identity means one is confident enough to include others. To insist that using the word \"British\" is racist will erode what little confidence a lot of British people have and lack of confidence can lead to pathological hatred and resentment or petty nationalism. </p> <p>Incidentally, I am Canadian-British - from the country that actually invented multiculturalism.

You simply cannot have a multi-ethnic Britain if the home secretary and his ministers go on attacking bogus asylum seekers and bogus gypsies in the way they do and so long as they persist with the policy of dispersal and vouchers. Not surprisingly the report has wandered off into a discussion of abstractions in a way which will give widespread offence. <br> <b> Prof John Rex</b> <br> Centre for research in ethnic relations, University of Warwick <a href=\"mailto:johnrex@clara.net\">johnrex@clara.net</a></p> <p>\u0095At the Sydney Olympics black British gold medalist Denise Lewis wrapped herself in a union flag (described as a \"racist\" flag). In France, people from ethnic minorities with French citizenship are proud to call themselves French. There is racism but there's a recognition that it's a multi-racial society. For a Briton to claim his or her citizenship is \"racist\" is totally unjustified if not ridiculous.

  "<p>Tsunamis are silent, stalking horrors that often appear without warning and with no apparent cause to devastate a coastline thousands of kilometres from their source. </p> <p>Compared with earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, images of tsunamis are rare. Anyone close enough to photograph them is usually rewarded with a watery grave alongside the fragmented remains of the camera. </p> <p>Most result from large submarine earthquakes that give the sea floor and the water above such a jolt that waves shoot outwards in all directions. In the last century alone, earthquakes around the Pacific rim produced over 400 tsunamis in this way resulting in the loss of over 50,000 lives. </p> <p>Volcanoes can also produce devastating tsunamis, with the cataclysmic 1883 eruption of Krakatoa (Indonesia) churning up the sea sufficiently to produce lethal waves that killed 36,000 people. </p> <p>Submarine landslides are also particularly effective: a gigantic collapse off the coast of Norway around 7,000 years ago resulted in north-eastern Scotland being inundated by huge waves. </p> <p>Even scarier are the mega-tsunamis formed by gigantic landslides at ocean island volcanoes. Before the last Ice Age a chunk of rock ten times the size of the Isle of Wight fell off the flank of the Mauna Loa volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii, forming tsunamis that raged 320m up the sides of neighbouring islands and even pounded the coastline of New South Wales 7,000km away. </p> <p>Scarier still, when a 1km asteroid plunged into the southeast Pacific just over two million years ago it sent a 70m wave of destruction hurtling across the entire Pacific. </p> <p>They are very different from the normal, wind-driven waves that break millions of times a day on our shores. One of their strangest properties is the Jekyll and Hyde transformation as they approach the shore. In deep water a tsunami is to all intents and purposes invisible; a wave less than a metre high that is lost among the troughs and peaks of a turbulent sea. </p> <p>Only when the tsunami enters shallow water does it start to build in height as the front of the wave slows and is caught by more water from behind. In a matter of minutes a half-metre swell can become a wall of water 20m or more high. And if the waves are focused into estuaries and bays, this height can increase even further. This behaviour sheds light on the derivation of the term \"tsunami\", which in the original Japanese means 'harbour wave'. </p> <p>The building of a tsunami as it approaches a coastline also results in another of its weird properties. As the wave increases in size it sucks in water that causes the sea to retreat from the shore, sometimes as far as the horizon or beyond - collecting it all together for the big push. </p> <p>Unless the local population has been educated in the mysteries of the tsunami, this can be lethal as thousands rush curiously on to the exposed sea-bed only to be battered by the sudden appearance of the tsunami itself. And can they move? In deep water, tsunamis can move at speeds in excess of 800km an hour - as fast as a jet aircraft - and even when the wave slows as it enters the shallows there is no possibility of outrunning it. </p> <p>Another difference between tsunamis and wind-driven storm waves is that the entire column of water from the sea surface to the sea floor, perhaps several kilometres high, is involved in the wave motion. </p> <p>So, for example, the entire volume of the ocean is involved in the transmission of a tsunami from one side of the Pacific to the other. Trying to cram all this movement into progressively shallowing waters is part of the reason for the terrifying height increase as a tsunami approaches a coastline. The water simply has nowhere else to go but up. </p> <p>But it is not only the spectacular height and power of tsunamis that makes them so destructive. When they hit the coast they just keep coming - perhaps for 20 to 30 minutes - before taking the same time to drain back into the ocean. This is because a tsunami wavelength is typically hundreds of kilometres long rather than the few tens of metres characteristic of storm waves. </p> <p> Such long waves reflect the scale of the phenomena that generate tsunamis. If a submarine quake thrusts upwards an area of sea floor the size of England by a metre or two then you can be sure that the ripples formed will be of a comparably spectacular scale. </p> <p>The destructive power of a tsunami is truly awesome. Ships and coastal installations are smashed to matchwood in seconds and solid metal structures such as parking metres are combed flat. A three-storey building would be lucky to survive an impact from a 10m wave, while a 20m wave would leave a five storey office block much the worse for wear. </p> <p>A fragile human caught in the open has almost no chance of survival and severe battering by debris results in few bodies being recovered intact. Many, in fact, are carried far out into the ocean never to be seen again. </p> <p>Things have been relatively quiet on the tsunami front since 1998 when an offshore earthquake and accompanying submarine landslide generated a series of waves that flattened villages and took 3,000 lives on the north coast of New Guinea . Sadly, further big earthquakes are sure to repeat this scenario time and time again in coming years. </p> <p>Waiting in the wings, however, is the terrifying prospect of the coming Atlantic mega-tsunami. The western flank of the Cumbre Vieja volcano on the Canary Island of La Palma remains unstable and poised to slide into the sea. Recent modelling has shown that when this happens the initial wave will be 600m high. Eight hours later, as the wall of water bears down on the east coast of the United States and the Caribbean Islands, the human race will face the greatest natural catastrophe in its history. You have been warned! </p> <p>\u0095 Bill McGuire is the Benfield Greig professor of geohazards and director of the Benfield Greig Hazard research centre at University College London.
