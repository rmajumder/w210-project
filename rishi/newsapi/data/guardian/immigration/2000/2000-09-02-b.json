  "<p>Customers who pay their credit card bills in full by the statement demand date pay no interest at all, with a few exceptions. Those who do charge even when you clear the account include: Alliance &amp; Leicester Diamond, Bank of Scotland 'One', Halifax Visa Balance, Lloyds TSB Asset Advance, Co-op Gold Advantage. </p> <p>Otherwise, for the months that you do not pay your bill in full by the due date, you are charged interest on the whole balance and not just the amount left unpaid. In these circumstances, most cards start charging interest from the date you make the purchase. Until now, John Lewis has been generous and charged no interest until the first of the month after the payment due date. But from October, with sister store Waitrose, it will backdate interest to the date of purchase. </p> <p>When you paid no interest until the due date, it made no difference whether you paid early or late in the month. But with interest clocking up from the day you shop, you can save interest by paying the bill when it arrives. Interest builds up daily, so the sooner you pay, the less interest you incur. If you pay the bill in full, you avoid interest anyway, so might as well pay at the last moment. </p> <p>At the end of the month, card companies calculate your average daily balance. Assuming, in a 31-day month, you spent \u00a32,000 on the 10th and \u00a350 on the 20th: you have borrowed \u00a32,000 for 22 days and \u00a350 for 12 days. The daily average balance is \u00a31,438.71. Multiply this by the monthly interest rate for the interest until the date of the statement. But this is only the start of the calculation. You then pay interest from the statement date until the time you pay the bill, again based on the daily average, but taking account of credits and money paid in. It means you are paying interest on the interest. </p> <p>You can reduce interest charges by making large purchases late in the month. Your balance at the end of the month will be high but the daily average will be lower.</p>",
  "<p>It's four in the morning, nearly pitch-black, minus 20C, and I am inching my way up a scree slope 5,000 metres in the air. I have been walking for three hours, and it's another three to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa. </p> <p>The iron band around my head is tightening, the nausea is rising, black spots flash in front of my eyes and my breathing comes fast and shallow. As I battle against the rapidly worsening altitude sickness, I can no longer remember why I am here. </p> <p>With the arrival of dawn, I should be jubilant, but the summit still seems insurmountable. Then I see, 50m above me, the people I have walked with for the past five days. I heave myself over the last boulders. </p> <p>The relief, as I stand looking at the ice fields on the summit, is overwhelming and it is only later that any sense of achievement hits me. This has been the most physically demanding experience of my life, not a holiday. </p> <p>We have been climbing Kilimanjaro the hard way: renouncing the huts, canteens and running water of the Merangu or the \"Coca-Cola\" route - so-called because the soft drink can be bought all the way up - and camping each night above the clouds in sub-zero temperatures. </p> <p>For six days, we have tried to keep clean with just half a washing-up bowl of water; drunk from tarns flavoured with algae; and wrapped ourselves in layer upon layer of dust-caked garments to try and keep warm at night. The pain of altitude sickness has been unlike anything previously encountered, with headaches that seem to paralyse your spirit. But it has crystalised my priorities: all that is important is water, warmth, food, and that my boyfriend and I make it safely back down the mountain. </p> <p><strong> The route</strong><br> </p> <p> We've chosen to follow the little-used Naremoru route, a track that snakes up the north side of the mountain, starting close to the Kenyan border, before encompassing Mawenzi, a 5,100m volcano to the east of Kibo, the final part of Kilimanjaro and the toughest part of the ascent. </p> <p>According to our travel company, Exodus, we should have been taking the Rongai Route, described in the brochure as \"the easiest of all the routes\". But when we arrive, our rep, Edward, tells us it is closed because Somali bandits have been ambushing unsuspecting trekkers. </p> <p>Initially, the Naremoru is less steep than the start of the Coca-Cola route (via which we descend), and takes six days instead of five - to aid acclimatisation and improve our chances of getting to the summit. But it is longer and more gruelling since it involves camping, and has none of the infrastructure of the southern route. </p> <p>If you fall ill on the Coca-Cola route, there is medical assistance at each of the huts and the track is wide enough for a Land Rover ambulance to go up to 4,700m, the bottom of the Kibo crater. If you fall ill on the Naremoru, you have to struggle for four days until you reach Kibo, or face a lonely descent alone with a guide. On the plus side, the Naremoru turns out to be far more unspoilt: each day, some 300 tourists clamber up the Coca-Cola, whereas only the seven in our group went up the Naremoru each day, joined at points by a four-strong French group. </p> <p>And the scenery is more wild and varied: over the four days to Kibo, we pass from forests, heather and moorland to the barren but spectacular crags of Mawenzi tarn, and the lunar desert of The Saddle - the lava-covered expanse between Mawenzi and Kibo. </p> <p>The final ascent is scree; the summit, rock and ice fields; and the descent - via the Coca-Cola route -is more moorland before miles of rainforest. </p> <p><strong> The climb</strong><br> </p> <p> The actual walking, we discover as we begin climbing on the first day, is not particularly arduous. But then, by our first evening we have only climbed to 2,600m - from the 1,800m starting point - and altitude will not affect us for at least another 1,000m. </p> <p>The nagging headache - faint at first - only begins towards the end of the second day when we have climbed a further 1,000m to 3,600m and camped in a supposedly sheltered valley, where the wind threatens to blow our tent down. </p> <p>By this stage, though, the beauty of our surroundings has taken hold, and our bodies have relaxed into a rhythm reached through the day's eight hours of walking. The sun - fierce so near to the Equator and increasingly-intense as we rise higher - beats strongly; the clouds spread above the plains of Kenya to our left, and, to our right, towers our ice-capped challenge: Kibo. </p> <p>We have also relaxed with each other and by the time the effects of altitude deepen on the third day - as we rise to 4,300m at the spectacular Mawenzi Tarn - we are looking out for one another: no longer strangers but potential friends bound by a unique experience we suspect will grow harder. </p> <p>There are three of us in our twenties: myself, my boyfriend Phil, and Sian, a well-travelled 23-year-old who is finding the climb tough, throwing up through altitude, but still managing to be cheerful. </p> <p>Then there is Terry, and his son Tom, who celebrates his 16th birthday on the last day of the trek; Vince, a 45-year-old who has been quietly obsessed with climbing the mountain since seeing a BBC documentary six years ago; and Donald, a 68-year-old who is deceptively fit and finally lets slip that he completed the West Coast Trail - a Canadian feat of endurance - just a month earlier. </p> <p>The cold begins to bite as we spend our fourth day walking from Mawenzi to the mountain's first volcanic peak of Kibo. Our shorts and T-shirts have been swapped for down jackets, layers of trousers and fleece hats and the wind is harsh as we spend seven hours slowly edging ourselves across The Saddle in preparation for the final ascent. </p> <p>That night, we barely sleep, aware that at midnight we will be woken to begin the final six-hours, by far the most arduous part of the trek, and the bit we have been dreading. \"It's purgatory,\" a friend who successfully climbed the 5,685m to Gilman's Point two years ago had warned - and she wasn't exaggerating. </p> <p>For those six hours, as I walked in a world marked by Vince's ankles before me and Phil's voice behind me, I pushed myself harder than I thought possible - and I still couldn't work out why I was doing it. </p> <p>The reason came later, as our plane flew out of Kilimanjaro and alongside the mountain - we had been to the top of a continent. And we felt invincible.</p> <p><strong>Getting fit and buying the kit </strong></p> <p>Exodus warns that Kilimanjaro is a \"long and hard trek\" and that \"if you are not prepared to exercise and take walks regularly, you are unlikely to make it to the summit\". However, you don't need to be stunningly fit, and some of the Americans sweating their way up to Kibo certainly weren't. </p> <p>The main problem was always going to be altitude not aerobic fitness. Over five months, I tried to work out up to three times a week at the gym, combining aerobic exercise - cycling, running and spin classes - with walking on a treadmill set on the steepest incline.</p> <p>My boyfriend, Phil, and I also managed a few aerobically-taxing walks, including the hilliest part of the South Downs Way, from Buriton to Cocking, and a 14-mile stretch from Sidmouth to Branscombe and back in Devon - a walk that involves scaling six sheer cliffs, returning each time to the sea. We practised walking in the heat - plodding at 35C - after dragging our boots to the mountains of Crete.</p> <p><strong>Cost of the gear </strong></p> <p>It's an extortionate business, but worth investing in. Some of the kit - like my water-proof jacket - was top-of-the-range other bits less so. Boots and outer clothing are the priorities.</p> <p><strong> Boots (Gore-Tex lined):</strong> \u00a3140.<br> <strong> Waterproof jacket (Gore-Tex):</strong> \u00a3240.<br> <strong> Waterproof trousers:</strong> \u00a323.99.<br> <strong> Socks six pairs at \u00a310.99 each:</strong> \u00a365.99.<br> <strong> Jacket Polartec fleece: </strong>\u00a360.<br> <strong> Thermal longjohns \u00a329.</strong><br> <strong> Thermal long-sleeve top:</strong> \u00a323.<br> <strong> Two dry-flo tops:</strong> \u00a323.99 each.<br> <strong> Light trousers:</strong> \u00a335.<br> <strong> Four-seasons duvet jacket hired from Exodus:</strong> \u00a325.<br> <strong> Four/five-seasons sleeping bag hired from Exodus:</strong> \u00a325.<br> <strong> Polartec hat:</strong> \u00a310.<br> <strong> Sun hat:</strong> \u00a35.99.<br> <strong> Head torch:</strong> \u00a313.99.<br> <strong> Water bottle:</strong> \u00a34.99.<br> <strong> Batteries (for torch):</strong> \u00a32.99.<br> <strong> Factor 25 suntan cream:</strong> \u00a39.99.<br> <strong> Therma-rest mat:</strong> \u00a355.</p> <p><strong> Total cost</strong> \u00a3811.92</p> <p><strong>Chocolate, a stubborn streak and Sarah's other tips for the top </strong></p> <p>There are some things you just shouldn't be without: </p> <p>\u0095 Boots and plasters: worn-in boots plus Compeed plasters which act like a second skin if you are threatened with blisters.</p> <p>\u0095 Chocolate: essential when the altitude sickness saps your appetite but you need a fix of energy.</p> <p>\u0095 Earplugs: because people snore more at altitude and sleep is essential.</p> <p>\u0095 Sleeping mat: expensive but insulating.

  "<b>Dear Terry,</b> <br> At the risk of sounding like a conservative old so-and-so, let me say why gay relationships should get more formal recognition. <p>At the moment, I am allowed a boyfriend; I can go to dinner parties with him, and maybe even the office Christmas party. Friends may even come to think of us as a couple. But relationships are one thing; marriage gives something extra. It signals a mutual expectation that our relationship is more committed and more durable than a casual fling. And it tells the world to treat us as such: to invite us to dinner parties together, to support and counsel us and even not to lead us into temptation.</p> <p>And on those inevitable bad days when my partner and I feel like we want to break up, the sheer cost of having got married, and of having publicly affirmed our commitment to each other, would certainly make us think twice about taking any precipitous action. Marriage helps couples rise above the day-to-day challenges of staying together - and that can help them find fulfilment as a result.</p> <p>If marriage didn't exist, someone would invent it. And most human societies have developed arrangements for binding individuals together in reasonably secure relationships. In our society, most people choose to join the marriage institution, for all its flaws. Do you really want us to be excluded? </p> <p> All the best,<br> Evan</p> <p><b>Dear Evan,</b><br> What exactly is marriage going to bring to your relationship that isn't there already? Rules, that's what. And as heterosexuals have discovered to their cost, swearing to abide by a lot of unreasonable rules, invented by a misogynistic and homophobic church, can bring nothing but trouble.</p> <p>The fundamental advantage gay relationships have over marriage is that we can tailor them precisely to our requirements. We can make it up as we go along, change with the circumstances and go with the flow. We don't have to promise sexual exclusivity or to share our worldly goods if we don't want to. We don't have to live together if it's inconvenient or unwanted. We don't have to struggle to fit into someone else's idea of what is the \"right\" way to do things. We yield that flexibility at our peril.</p> <p>If we want our friends and families to support and respect our relationships then we have to convince them that we are serious about each other. Only by observing our behaviour to one another will they know we are truly committed. A certificate bestowed by some institution is meaningless as a measure of our love.</p> <p>Certainly marriage is still a popular institution: most people give it a shot at some time in their life. And look how many of them are now clamouring to get out of it. When judged against common sense, it's a ludicrous way to proceed. Expecting two people to stay together for 50 or 60 years is not only unreasonable, it's positively cruel.</p> <p>Best wishes, <br> Terry</p> <p><b>Dear Terry,</b><br> I am not arguing that marriage should be compulsory - only that it should be an option.</p> <p>We both know plenty of people who want to \"go with the flow\", as you put it. Maybe we all do to some extent. But there are plenty of others who find the opportunity to fly more scary than staying on the ground. Some want rules to guide them and are happy to constrain their behaviour, particularly if doing so extracts a commitment from someone else to do the same.</p> <p>Few of us like short-tenure housing arrangements; or temp-agency employment contracts. Why on earth should companionship arrangements be taken so much less seriously? Some flourish with freedom; others can't function until they've secured stability.</p> <p>Of course, no one would argue that getting a marriage certificate guarantees a successful relationship; or that it absolves partners of having to negotiate satisfying arrangements. But it does at least tend to offer an off-the-shelf commitment on the part of both parties to invest a great deal into making the relationship work - and to try to grow together. It's not for all. But for many, the freedom you describe is more tyrannical than the spouse.</p> <p>Yours, <br> Evan</p> <p><b>Dear Evan,</b><br> The statistics speak for themselves - marriage doesn't work for heterosexuals, why should it work for gay people? The only thing we'd gain from institutionalising gay marriage is a lot of of painful and messy divorce. Which is not to say that I don't think long-term gay relationships are a good idea for those who want them - I've been in one myself for 20 years. But even if the government deigned to legalise some kind of same-sex marriage, we wouldn't take it up.</p> <p>You say people should have the choice to marry. The problem with choice is that a lot of gay people won't have one. Many simply don't have a partner. You might say the same thing applies to heterosexuals, but special circumstances apply to gay people. There are fewer of us to go round and the odds against finding the ideal - or even a tolerable - mate are much higher than for straights.</p> <p>By legalising marriage for those lucky enough to have found Mr or Ms Right, we are in danger of creating a two-tier gay community, with the \"married\" couples being supported and accepted while the remainder are left as outsiders, enjoying none of the privileges that legal recognition would bring to the attached.</p> <p>Gay culture (and I'm not talking about the commercial exploitation that passes for entertainment on Old Compton St or Canal St) is unique. It is something that we should treasure. If we start playing by straight rules, our heritage, our colourful history and all that we share as a community will disappear into the heterosexual void. I'm all for breaking down barriers, and making progress, but there comes a moment when we must value our special place in the world. Simply giving ourselves up to become ersatz heterosexuals, when we have so much of value to contribute on our own terms, would be a shame. </p> <p>Best wishes, <br> Terry</p> <p><b>Dear Terry,</b><br> Gay culture is undoubtedly special, and certainly worth preserving. But as you point out in your reference to its tackier elements in the commercial scenes of London and Manchester, it is an illusion to think there is a single gay culture. There are suburban couples, gym queens, lipstick lesbians, leather-clad motorbikers, clubgoers, the works. </p> <p>Making it easier for people to settle down would not threaten the vibrancy of gay life; it would enrich it, particularly for those gay people who are uncomfortable with the more superficial bar scene. As for the have-nots, who will never find Mr or Ms Right, I have little fear. Marriage - as you point out - is unlikely to become as universal a habit among same-sex couples as it is for straight ones, so the singles will not be left stranded.</p> <p>Finally, you argue that we might end up with a two-tier gay community, with the non-marrieds \"enjoying none of the privileges\" of married couples. That's not how I see it. Gay couples should not get legal privileges. But they should not be deprived of the rights of serious relationships in immigration, joint tenancy, inheritance, hospital visiting, etc.</p> <p>Some kind of legal marriage arrangement is perhaps best seen as a passport to a cluster of those \"couples' rights\". It would remove most of the last nonsensical legal deprivations which gay people have had to endure. You can't be against that. </p> <p>All the very best, <br> Evan</p> <p><b>Dear Evan,</b><br> I think our only real difference is in the use of the term \"marriage\". To me it comes heavily burdened with the kind of baggage that gay people should be glad they aren't required to shoulder.</p> <p>I favour the French version, introduced a couple of years ago. There, any couple who live in a mutually supportive relationship can register their partnership at the local mairie. They could be a gay couple, an unmarried straight couple or even two elderly sisters. Those registering qualify for the fiscal advantages enjoyed by married couples. Nobody needs be excluded, and even those gay people who live together as dear friends, but not lovers, can benefit.</p> <p>If gay couples want a \"big day\" type of ceremony at which they show their intimate circle that they've made a serious commitment, then that's OK with me. I love dressing up, and some of the bridal gowns these days are to die for. The lesbian and gay Christian movement will provide you with a sympathetic vicar or, if you want to leave God out of it (and He certainly wants you to leave Him out of it), the Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association have celebrants who'll see you right.</p> <p>Loving, long-term partnerships that have some kind of recognition - yes. Marriage - definitely no.</p> <p>Love to you and yours, <br> Terry</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.kitsch.freeserve.co.uk/life/info10.htm\" target=\"_new\">UK lesbian &amp; gay weddings</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.OutRage.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">OutRage</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.galha.freeserve.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association</a></p>",
  "<p>The far-right Danish People's party, one of the country's most vociferous opponents of the euro, is to scrap a major advertising campaign ahead of this month's referendum because it fears it is alienating leftwing voters who loathe its policies as much as they detest the single currency. </p> <p>The DPP has, in the minds of many Danes, become closely associated with the campaign to reject the euro in a referendum on September 28. </p> <p>However, the media have seized on other of its policies, such as the repatriation of refugees, castration of paedophiles and \"Denmark for the Danes\", creating a welter of embarrassing publicity. </p> <p>The leftwing Socialist People's party and grassroots organisations are also pushing for a No vote in the crucial referendum but their media profile has been much lower. </p> <p>The DPP will make a final push for a Nej to the euro this weekend at their annual congress, where the maverick Tory MEP and Daily Telegraph leader writer Daniel Hannan will be the guest of honour. But party officials conceded yesterday that this would be their last big campaign effort. </p> <p>\"A lot of leftwingers are against the EU and the euro but if we are too aggressive, especially in the newspapers and on TV, perhaps we will deter them,\" Jens Wibeck, a DPP official, said. \"We don't want to be too provocative and the press is always on our backs. Too much focus has been on us.\" The DPP's leadership has found the media attention uncomfortable and its governing board is to step into the shadows after this weekend's congress. </p> <p>A planned nationwide television and newspaper advertising campaign has been pulled and the DPP's outspoken leader, Pia Kjaersgaard, is expected to curb her more colourful outbursts. </p> <p>Holger Nielsen, leader of the Socialist People's party, yesterday told the Guardian he welcomed the DPP's change of tack but questioned its motives. \"If they had been very active it could have been a problem,\" he said. \"My own opinion is that they will save the money they would have spent on an ad campaign and spend it on refugee questions. That's the real reason.\" </p> <p>An opinion poll yesterday gave the Yes camp a 4% lead over the No camp, but the vote is still too close to call, even though the Danish government, most political parties, the media and big business have backed a Yes vote.</p>",
  "The Cuban president, Fidel Castro, created a flurry of excitement yesterday by signalling his intention to attend next week's UN millennium summit in New York, the biggest gathering of world leaders in history. <p>While his presence will add unpredictability to proceedings, it will also attract demonstrations from Cuban exiles still seething from the Elian Gonzales immigration row. </p> <p>The leaders of more than 150 of the 188 countries that make up the UN are scheduled to attend the summit. Mr Castro had been thought unlikely to attend. </p> <p>The Cuban foreign ministry said yesterday: \"This morning, we communicated to the US government that the delegation would be presided by comrade Fidel. Now, everything depends on the attitude taken by the US government.\" </p> <p>Anti-Castro forces in the US immediately called for him to be denied a visa. But a spokesman at the Cuba desk of the US state department indicated last night that permission will be granted. </p> <p>Mr Castro, 74, will provide an alternative voice at a summit that is shaping up to provide worthy resolutions on peacekeeping and poverty, but avoid the hard decisions needed to do anything about them. </p> <p>The three-day summit, which begins on Wednesday, will almost certainly endorse a UN declaration setting out goals for poverty-reduction and improved peacekeeping. The declaration is a condensed version of a speech made earlier this year by the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, in which he set out the aims of the UN for the 21st century. </p> <p>The aims include halving within 15 years the 22% of the world's population now existing on less than a dollar a day. The same timetable will be set for halting and reversing the spread of Aids. </p> <p>Tony Blair, in a speech on Wednesday, will throw Britain's weight behind a proposal against a permanent UN standing army, opting instead for a permanent high command, which, in theory, would mean a faster response to crises. </p> <p>In preparation for the summit, the US has been pressing to include a reference in the resolution for more equitable distribution of the financing for peacekeeping. Washington would like to reduce its 25% share of this budget, council diplomats say. </p> <p>The US was also unhappy at suggestions that the council should pledge to consider time limits when imposing sanctions. Under criticism for its sanctions on Iraq, the council had begun giving time limits for sanctions, but the US has resisted making this a policy. </p> <p>Reflecting fears that the voices of the developing world and the non-governmental organisations will fall on deaf ears, an alternative summit has been scheduled to take place at the same time. The key speaker at this \"State of the World Forum\" will be the former Russian president, Mikhail Gorbachev. </p> <p>A spokesman for the alternative summit said it will provide a platform for the kind of dissenting voices heard only on the streets at recent international meetings.</p>",
