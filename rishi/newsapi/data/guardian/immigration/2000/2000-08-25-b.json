  "Jack Straw, the home secretary, is clearly feeling rather bruised by the recent criticisms made by the United Nations committee on elimination of race discrimination of the government's race strategy. After all, the UK's report to them was not only - as always - lengthy and on time, it was also probably the most open and progressive report it had submitted: recording some positive achievements and targets, stating its commitment to achieving race equality and admitting to the need for further work. <p>Had Straw been at the committee's meeting in Geneva, he might not have been so surprised. One of the issues on which the government came to grief, as many of its predecessors have, was over the race/immigration divide. </p> <p>The government stressed its toughness on institutional racism and racial attacks, its commitment to employment equality targets, and its strong support for the Lawrence family and inquiry. But this only served to highlight the failure to respond promptly and clearly to a vicious and racist anti-asylum-seeker press campaign, the exemptions for immigration law in the new Race Relations (Amendment) Act, and the social exclusion of asylum-seekers that is almost bound to result from the new support system of dispersal and vouchers. </p> <p>The UN committee were right to conclude as they did that racism is indivisible; there cannot be a trade-off between fair treatment of minority groups already here and those that newly arrive. Attacks on one group of strangers encourage hostility to all who are visibly different. As the committee pointed out, the dispersal system \"may hamper the adequate access of asylum-seekers to legal and other necessary services, eg health and education\". So, while one part of government has an action plan designed to deal with the consequences of decades of racial injustice, another is setting up a system that is likely to create disadvantage and exclusion for the present and future. </p> <p> O ne of the most important elements, for those of us from non-government groups who were present, and for the committee itself, was the presence of around a dozen black and Asian people from ethnic minority and community organisations. They had come to be witnesses, in both senses: listening to the hearings, and also providing vivid personal testimony to members of the committee on inadequate investigation of deaths in custody, school exclusions and racial harassment in schools, the degrading treatment of asylum-seekers and the marginalisation of community organisations. Those testimonies were a powerful reminder of the people who lie behind the statistics and who are supposed to underpin the policies in the UK's report. </p> <p>Though the government claimed that its report had been written after consultation with over 40 of the main race bodies, those who were present did not find that their views or their voices had been properly reflected. They were part of a larger group of human rights, asylum and community organisations which presented an alternative report on UK race policies, with some powerful criticisms. </p> <p>They are not the only group to feel consulted but not listened to: children's rights groups made the same comments about the UK's report on the rights of the child convention; many asylum groups regretted the time and energy spent in discussions that seemed to have little effect on the eventual content of the Immigration and Asylum Act. Homeless groups have spoken of \"access without influence\". Often, the government ap pears to signal that what it wants from the non-governmental community is gratitude, rather than engagement. </p> <p>The irony is that, in relation to this report, the key concerns of the committee and outside groups are also core parts of the government programme. Action on racist attacks and harassment school exclusions, equality of employment opportunities, dealing with institutional racism within the police and public authorities - even the successful integration of asylum-seekers - are all among the key government objectives presented to the UN committee. </p> <p>The committee is looking for outcomes, however, as well as policies: it wants a progress report and a comprehensive strategy. non-governmental organisations have unique experience that can assist in achieving those outcomes. That should be an opportunity, not a problem, for a government that opened its report to the committee by stressing its \"joined-up\" approach as well its appreciation of its \"critical friends\" outside government. </p> <p>\u0095 Anne Owers is director of the campaigning organisation Justice </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Topsy-Turvy </strong><br> Rental <br>Fox Path\u00e9 Cert 12 <br> ***</p> <p>A Mike Leigh film about Gilbert and Sullivan seemed as intriguing as it was surprising in prospect. In the event, I think Topsy-Turvy is more likely to please G&amp;S fanatics than Leigh's usual audience. This very relaxed, very long film has little of the director's usual pacing and feel for the flawed eccentricity of his characters.</p> <p>Only once, in the final scene between Jim Broadbent's Gilbert and his wife, Leigh regular Lesley Manville, does a scene have an authentic Mike Leigh stamp - it's a parallel of Sam Kelly's bedtime chat with Lindsay Duncan in Grown-Ups 20 years ago. It's as if Leigh and his cast were a bit in awe of Gilbert's wittily precise lyrics, given full bloom here in interminable rehearsal scenes.</p> <p>Leigh picks a specific point in the G&amp;S career when, after mixed reviews for Princess Ida, Sullivan (Allan Corduner) decides he's had enough of \"trivial souffl\u00e9s\" and wants to switch to serious work. Differences seem irretrievable until the gruff, bad-tempered Gilbert sees a Japanese performance at a cultural exhibition and conceives the idea of The Mikado, perhaps their best-remembered work.</p> <p>Broadbent and Timothy Spall (as a Doyly Carte star) are, as ever, enjoyable to watch and Leigh gets some mileage out of new inventions like the telephone and throws in the occasional anachronism (I don't think anyone said \"I could murder a pork chop\" in 1884) but compared to the director's usual output, it all seems terribly inconsequential.</p> <p><strong> The End of the Affair </strong><br> Rental and DVD (\u00a319.99) <br>Columbia Tristar Cert 18 <br> **</p> <p>A rather glum Graham Greene adaptation featuring an agonised thwarted romance of a Brief Encounter kind, played out among grey hats and trenchcoats on rainy days. It hinges on a central puzzle: why does Julianne Moore suddenly end her affair with Ralph Fiennes after he is nearly killed in an air raid? To anyone familiar with Greene's world of illicit sex and Catholic guilt, the reason comes as no surprise, so Neil Jordan's film concentrates more on recreating the feelings and morals of wartime. Its sentimental, violin-laden style defeats the considerable best efforts of Fiennes and Moore.</p> <p><strong> Freedom Song </strong><br> Rental <br>Warner Cert 15 <br> ***</p> <p>Far superior to most \"made for TV\" fare, Freedom Song is a coolly sensible look at the civil rights battle of the early 60s, written and directed by Phil Alden Robinson, best known for writing Field of Dreams. Vicellous Reon Shannon is the hotheaded son, keen for action, Danny Glover his weary, cautious father. Best of all is Vondie Curtis-Hall as a quietly non-heroic teacher, brought in from Chicago to help Mississippians register to vote. An intelligently-argued explanation of whitesploitation and a worthy companion piece for Spike Lee's fine documentary, Four Little Girls.</p> <p><strong> Mystery, Alaska </strong><br> Rental <br>Buena Vista Cert 15 <br> ***</p> <p>On sports films, the usual rule is: avoid unless by Ron Shelton. This ice-hockey drama directed by Jay Roach, of Austin Powers fame, isn't in the class of Shelton's Bull Durham, but it juggles its different plot strands skilfully and does include Mrs Shelton, Lolita Davidovitch.</p> <p>Russell Crowe (whose presence probably ensured its video release) has just been dropped from the team to make way for a promising youngster while his wife is distracted by the return of her old boyfriend (Hank Azaria) who's setting up a game against the New York Rangers on the local frozen pond while local businesses are threatened by a megamall. It skates close to cliche but mostly makes fun of them: \"This is our pond,\" Crowe emotes seriocomically to inspire his team. Crowe and silver-haired coach Burt Reynolds are in fine form and co-writer David E Kelly throws in a courtroom heart attack to remind you he does Ally McBeal too.</p>",

All the words, except one, are of Arabic origin. In fact, there are probably several hundred Arabic words in English, though dictionaries don't always make the derivation clear: many have entered the language through Spanish or French. </p> <p> Most of the words came to Europe during the seven centuries of Muslim rule which began in 711 AD when an army led by Tariq ibn Ziyad landed at what we now know as Gibraltar - a mispronunciation of Jabal Tariq (\"Tariq's mountain\"). The Arabs rapidly conquered Spain, Portugal and parts of Italy, and ventured as far north as Poitiers in France.</p> <p>The contribution that the Arabs made to our civilisation during this period is often overlooked today - though anyone who visits Granada, Cordova or Seville in southern Spain cannot fail to be reminded of it, and impressed.</p> <p>The Arabs of those days were great seekers of knowledge, collecting and translating books from all over the known world. Much of ancient Greek literature - including works by Aristotle, Euclid, Galen and Hippocrates - first reached western Europe through Arabic translations. </p> <p>But it was in the early development of sciences - medicine, chemistry, astronomy and mathematics - that the Arabs really excelled. None more so than mathematics. They gave us our numbering system (much more efficient than the Roman system, though the Arabs themselves later adopted Indian numerals).</p> <p> They also developed algebra and improved on ancient Greek geometry. But perhaps their biggest contribution in mathematics is nothing at all: they discovered the concept of zero, without which most modern technology would not work.</p> <p>Muslim rule in Europe ended in 1492 which, by coincidence, was the year that Christopher Columbus set foot in America. I was intrigued the other day to read an article on the internet (http://users.erols.com/gmqm/columbus.html) suggesting that he probably baffled the inhabitants of the New World by greeting them in Arabic: as-salaamu alaykum (\"peace be upon you\").</p> <p>This is not as improbable as it sounds. In those days Arabic was very much an international language, and Columbus had been looking for a new route to the East Indies - an area which he knew the Arabs had explored before him. So he took with him Luis de Torres, an Arabic-speaking Spaniard, as his interpreter.</p> <p>Today, the tables are turned. Arabs usually resort to English when encountering a foreigner. Indeed, they say \"aloo\" (hello) when answering the phone, even if the caller is likely to be another Arab.</p> <p>A few years ago I went on an Arabic language course in Jordan. One day, for comprehension practice, we were taken to the university's engineering department for a talk about some solar-powered street lights they were developing.</p> <p>After a few moments our teacher interrupted. \"The students are here to learn Arabic. Please don't speak in English.\"</p> <p>\"It's very difficult,\" said the engineer. \"I don't have the words in Arabic.\"</p> <p>Many Arabs worry about this, believing that their language is losing its purity in the face of an onslaught of foreign vocabulary. Some would like to see an Arabic Academy, along the lines of the French Academy, discouraging the use of foreign words and promoting alternatives derived from Arabic roots.</p> <p>Sometimes the Arabic words do exist. Sayyara (\"a thing that moves about\") is widely used for \"car\", but Moroccans prefer tumubeel (a corruption of \"automobile\").</p> <p>Recently, I had a meeting with an Arab ambassador in London who is also a rather fine poet. We had intended to talk about politics but spent half an hour discussing language, which was much more interesting.</p> <p>He told me he had done something very radical and, to some Arabs, horrifying, in one of his poems. He had used al-talafoon - the everyday word for telephone - instead al-hatif, a classical word meaning, literally, \"the invisible caller\".</p> <p>The argument over linguistic immigration is not just a literary one: it has political and religious dimensions. Arab nationalists see it as another example of overbearing western influence, while devout Muslims believe that God chose to reveal His message - the Koran - in Arabic because of the superior qualities of the language.</p> <p>Arabic is certainly a wonderfully expressive language, and I have met Arabs with little education whose feel for its words and their capabilities is absolutely astonishing. But all languages have some weaknesses and, by interchange, can enrich each other.</p> <p>The Algerians are famous - or notorious - for mixing Arabic and French, often in the same sentence, and occasionally even in the same word. One of these hybrids is \"haytiste\" which combines the Arabic word hayt (\"wall\") with the French -iste (as in \"artiste\"). It describes the sort of young Algerian man - unemployed, bored and, in all probability, up to no good - who hangs around the streets leaning against walls.</p> <p>You won't find it in the dictionary, but you'd be hard pressed find an eight-letter word in any language more replete with colourful social imagery.</p> <p>* And the odd word out? Samizdat is Russian.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The ad:</strong> Two young men return home from some war or other to a rapturous welcome from the locals. One is the son of a publican and is greeted warmly by his father. They all enter a bar and the son recounts how his friend Henri saved his life in battle. His father thanks him and says they should celebrate, plonking a bottle of wine on the counter. \"Ah non, Papa - une Stella Artois,\" insists his son. The father pauses for a second, then reluctantly serves him a glass. But Henri, too, wants a Stella. The sneaky barman then secretly stands on the pipe behind the bar and claims the barrel is empty, pouring him instead \"une verre de vin\". </p> <p><strong> The jargon:</strong> This mini-epic continues in the fine Proven\u00e7al tradition established by previous Stella films. Once again it positions the lager brand as one of supreme, premium quality (you still don't get a free one even after saving someone's life) combined with a pukka continental heritage. </p> <p><strong> Personality: </strong> You're an 18-34-year-old mid-market male. Far from being a laddish lager lout or real ale-swilling beer bore, you are a bloke with a bit of integrity and fancy you're rather sophisticated, priding yourself on the fact that you understand the ad (which is all in French). </p> <p><strong> Financial status:</strong> Stella Artois may be positioned as \"Reassuringly Expensive\" but it doesn't, in fact, cost any more than other bottled lagers such as Kronenbourg and Becks. It's basically an everyday luxury and, as such, is meant to be accessible to the masses. </p> <p><strong> Telling lifestyle detail:</strong> You appreciate good quality and are no fashion victim, hence you aspire to drive a Saab or Audi rather than a more predictable badge brand, and your chosen holiday destination is more Mexico than Majorca. </p> <p><strong> Other relevant data:</strong> Real peasants from southern France were cast in the commercial to add authenticity. Also, recent econometric modelling (whatever that is) has shown that every \u00a31 spent on advertising Stella generates a revenue return of \u00a319, according to agency Lowe Lintas.</p>",
  "Gordon Brown, the chancellor, will face a demand for a 35% increase in the statutory minimum wage to take it to \u00a35 an hour, and for the restoration of a link between pensions and earnings, when he addresses the TUC's annual conference in Glasgow next month. <p>In a statement issued today, certain to be agreed by the full congress, the TUC General Council says it believes the legal minimum of \u00a33.70 an hour has had less impact than had been expected, and should be uprated by October next year to reflect increasing earnings and to help \"close the gap between the rich and poor\". </p> <p>Although the TUC has encouraged use of the \u00a35 figure as a wage bargaining target with employers, the demand to make this figure into a legally enforceable minimum is a significant advance on its previous call for \"somewhat more than \u00a34\", and was immediately criticised as \"potentially very damaging\" by the CBI, the main employers' organisation. </p> <p>Susan Anderson, CBI human resources director, said now was \"not the time to throw caution to the wind\", following a successful introduction in April last year. </p> <p>A \u00a35 statutory minimum would increase the pay of at least 2.5m part or full time workers, she said, compared to the 1.7m covered by the existing rate. Other proposals by the TUC, to get rid of the lower rate for workers under 21 and to introduce a minimum for 16 and 17-year-olds, were, she said, \"own goals\" that would result in there being fewer jobs for young people. </p> <p>The TUC general secretary, John Monks, described the minimum wage as being one of the government's greatest achievements, but qualified this praise by saying that the 10p per hour increase to \u00a33.70 from this October was \"welcome, but not enough\". </p> <p>\"Now it is clear, despite employer warnings, that the minimum wage's impact on jobs is negligible, it should be uprated to a more realistic level,\" said Mr Monks. \"Discredited employer scaremongering should not be permanently built into its level.\" </p> <p>The government's advisory body, the low pay commission, is due to make a recommendation next summer on whether and by how much to increase the minimum. </p> <p>The chancellor is blamed by union leaders for insisting on the creation of the lower youth minimum wage and for the delay in bringing in the \u00a33.70 adult rate, and also for setting this year's increase in the state pension at 75p a week. He is consequenetly expected to try to use his speech to highlight his credentials as being in reality a friend of the labour movement. </p> <p>The final agenda for the Glasgow congress shows the government will face pressure over its part-privatisation plans for air traffic control and the London Underground, as well as its enthusiasm for using the private finance initiative in public services. </p> <p>And it will come under attack over its policies towards asylum seekers, described in a Transport and General Workers' Union motion as serving to \"further alienate, stigmatise and segregate refugees\". </p> <p>\u0095 The Ford car company has been warned by the commission for racial equality to act on pledges it gave last year regarding treatment of its black and Asian workers, following years of allegations of racism at its Dagenham plant in Essex and a employment tribunal finding of discrimination, harassment and victimisation. The commission suspended a move for a formal investigation after Ford agreed to a tight timetable of action.</p>",
  "Wildlife campaigners yesterday welcomed a big increase in the number of rare species and habitats that are to be given extra protection. <p>The area of England deemed of European importance for its wildlife should grow by about half under government plans announced yesterday, while new codes for sites of special national scientific interest have been prepared in view of concerns that many sites have not been properly looked after.</p> <p>Some of the finest natural areas, such as the North Yorks moors, Ashdown Forest in Sussex, Dawlish Warren in Devon and the Overstrand Cliffs in Norfolk, are among 81 proposed additions, covering 300,000 hectares, to England's special areas of conservation.</p> <p>Beast Cliff in Robin Hood's Bay, Whitby, the Humber and Severn estuaries, the bogs of the Manchester Mosses near Warrington and Wigan, Wimbledon Common and Richmond Park in south-west London, Butser Hill in Hampshire, the Exmoor and Quantock oak woods on the Devon/Somerset border and the cliffs running from Hastings to Pett beach in East Sussex are among other sites proposed for the new list, which has gone out for public consultation.</p> <p>If the EU agrees, there will be 576 such sites in the UK and 228 in England. The measures offer new protection for mammals such as horseshoe bats, otters, grey seals and bottlenose dolphins, as well as rare snails, fish, beetles and plants, and for habitats including salt meadows, estuaries, heaths, cliffs, bogs, scrub and grassland.</p> <p>John Prescott, deputy prime minister, said the measures would be a big part of Britain's contribution to the EU's net work of nature conservation. The government and its quango English Nature will add the new areas to England's 4,000 sites of special scientific interest, which cover nearly 7% of its area. Measures in the countryside and rights of way bill are intended to improve protection for such sites.</p> <p>Although English Nature has limited powers to force landowners to restore damaged sites, conservation campaigners have wanted far tougher penalties for failure to look after such areas and more encouragement for owners to repair damage. The draft guidelines on protection for SSSIs include establishing new management and conservation schemes and ways of considering applications for activities that might damage sites.</p> <p>Mark Avery, conservation director of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said he remained concerned that the protection \"creates a false sense of security\". Craig Bennett, wildlife campaigner for Friends of the Earth, similarly urged the government \"to stand firm and put the interests of people and wildlife before the plans of big business\".</p> <p>Lady Young of Old Scone, chairman of English Nature, said: \"England now has over 900,000 hectares of protection for internationally threatened plants and animals and fragile habitats like sand dunes.\"</p>",

  "Marietta Soares did not have to speak to show that she was afraid of being caught talking to a white man. Continually glancing around, she was shaking as she described her family's plight, effectively held hostage for the past 11 months in a squalid refugee camp just inside Indonesian West Timor. <p>\"My three children and I get enough food for three helpings of rice each a day,\" she said. \"Occasionally we get a few vegetables or some dried fish, but they don't allow us go out to find our own food. We can only do what they let us and we rarely get any news except what they tell us. </p> <p>\"We really want to go home to East Timor, but it is impossible. They will beat us or maybe even kill us if we try. Even talking to you risks punishment.\" </p> <p>\"They\" are the militia, a mixture of East Timorese paramilitaries who support the Indonesian government in Jakarta, West Timorese thugs, and current and former members of the Indonesian armed forces. Feeling angry and betrayed by East Timor's overwhelming vote for independence last August after 25 years of Indonesian occupation, they are fighting a desperate campaign to try to reverse their defeat. </p> <p>Their aim is to win the right to create an Indonesian region in western East Timor. There is a political wing, the Heroes of Timorese Unity, which denies the militia existence and stresses that its campaign is a purely peaceful one. </p> <p>Their strategy is two pronged. The first is to use the remaining 130,000 of the refugees who fled militia violence in East Timor last year as a bargaining chip by preventing them returning to East Timor or - as tens of thousands wish to, building a new life in Indonesia. </p> <p>This is done by brute force and a skillful disinformation campaign, telling them that East Timor is so unsafe that people are flooding back to West Timor. While the forces of law and order in East Timor are far from complete, the territory is calm. </p> <p>The second part of the strategy involves fighting a guerrilla war in western East Timor against the international peacekeeping force. </p> <p><b> UN officials attacked </b><br> </p> <p> \"It took about six months for the militia and their army backers to regroup and plan a new strategy,\" said one of the few international aid workers still in Atambua, the town about five miles from the border where most of the refugee camps are located. </p> <p>\"During this time about 150,000 refugees returned to East Timor. But since April the militia have been escalating their campaign of terror and intimidation against both the refugees and the United Nations.\" </p> <p>This reached a new peak on Tuesday when, during a visit to what was considered to be one of the safest camps in West Timor,representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) were deliberately attacked for the first time. All three were beaten so badly that they needed hospital treatment and one, a local man called Gotlief, was lucky to escape with his life. </p> <p>\"At one point a group of about a dozen were hitting me with sticks and throwing stones at me as I was lying on the ground,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Then I heard one of them speaking my own local language so I shouted back that I am from the same small island as him and he ordered them to stop attacking me. If he had not done so, I would have been killed.\" </p> <p>As a result of the attack, the UNHCR has decided to suspend its operations in West Timor. \"We've been pushing for improved security since October but none of our demands have been met,\" said Jake Morland, the UNHCR spokesman in West Timor. </p> <p>\"The actions of the army and police amount to peanuts. They allow the militia to act with impunity and have not bothered to disarm the militias or arrest those responsible for the terror, intimidation and beatings.\" </p> <p>Two recent incidents exemplify the Indonesian army's attitude to the militia and the UNHCR. A day after seizing about a dozen semi-automatic rifles in a sweep of refugee camps around Atambua earlier this month, the army returned the weapons. The commander said he was afraid there would be a riot if he did not give them back. </p> <p>His counterpart in Kefamenanu, a town 55 miles west of Atambua, said this week that the UNHCR would only be allowed to keep vehicles on his base, as a security precaution, if they paid him rent for the parking spaces. </p> <p>The armed forces have made no concerted effort to stop the militiamen blocking the main road from Atambua to the East Timorese border. </p> <p> These barricades have been erected not only to stop the refugees sneaking back home, but also to starve the East Timorese into yielding to the militia's demands, according to a militiaman armed with a machete on one roadblock. </p> <p>\"[East Timorese leader] Xanana [Gusmao] said he would be happy to be independent even if he has to eat stones,\" he said. \"Well, let's see how they feel when we force them to really eat stones and drink their own piss.\" </p> <p>The militia's guerrilla war in East Timor began in April with short, sharp hit-and-run raids on communities just across the border. Now their its involve sending squads of well-armed and well-trained fighters deeper into the territory. At least eight are known to be operating at the moment, some as far as 60 miles into East Timor. </p> <p><b> Bitter fruit of darkness</b><br> </p> <p> \"The ones in our area are like Japanese ninjas,\" UN soldier in East Timor said. \"They are dressed all in black with white neckscarves. They carry modern weapons and lots of ammunition.\" </p> <p>So far the militia squads have not singled out civilians, except for food, and have killed only two international peacekeepers. But they have caused fear in many communities. </p> <p>It is unclear who is leading the militia. Diplomatic sources in Jakarta say they have accumulated conclusive evidence that several elements of the Indonesian army,particularly the special forces, are the driving force behind the campaign. </p> <p>The UN administrator in East Timor, Sergio Vieria de Mello, says he is confident that the threat will not last long. \"They are and will be made ever more irrelevant here and in Indonesia,\" he told local politicians this week. \"They belong to the past when irrational violence and force of weapons, not arguments, prevailed. They were the bitter fruit of darkness, and they shall return to it.\" </p> <p>But feelings in West Timor are more sombre. \"Unless the Indonesian government shows serious political will, the refugees could be stuck here for at least another year,\" Mr Morland said. </p> <p>The Indonesian deputy foreign minister, Hassan Wirajuda, admits there is a crisis but says it is very difficult to solve. \"This is not just a simple case of dealing with a few thugs,\" he said during a tour of East and West Timor this week. \"It is a complex problem involving many social issues, so what we need is a comprehensive solution.\" </p> <p>He proposes to greatly increase the number of Indonesian security troops in the border region to deal with the militia threat,close the camps, and put the refugees into transit centres for eventual return to East Timor or settlement in in Indonesia, according to their wishes. </p> <p>\"Our problem is that we do not have enough resources and so we are appealing to the international community for help,\" he said. </p> <p>But the international community is not backing the plan as it stands. \"If they close the camps forcibly, against the wishes of the refugees, it could be catastrophic,\" Mr Morland said. </p> <p>Meanwhile' tens of thousands of innocent victims like Marietta Soares continue to suffer. </p> <p>\"We aren't politicians,\" she said. \"We are just simple people who want to go home.\"</p>",
  "Polly Toynbee's enthusiasm for \"my Europe right or wrong\" is usually just amusing but when it's coupled with the anti-Americanism of her claim that \"the more we look at alien America, the more European we feel\" it moves to a higher level of Euro-rubbish (Comment, August 23). <p>She shouldn't assume that her dismissal of American culture, politicians and values just because they're different to hers, is a majority view. Britain draws its popular and much of its elite culture from the US. Socialists and Thatcherites both look to US egalitarianism dynamics and freedoms.

Moreover, US problems of budget, surplus, prolonging growth, dealing with poverty and globalisation are also ours, though they're more energetic, inventive and dynamic in seeking solutions. We should learn from the US not dismiss it. </p> <p>No use criticising the Americans because they don't follow Polly Toynbee's prescriptions. Europe isn't either.

UN forecasts are that the population of the US will increase from 267m in 1995 to 349m in 2050 including immigration while the EU population (exclusive of the UK) drops from 314m in 1995 to 235m in 2050. </p> <p>Future labour force comparisons are even more lopsided in favour of the Anglo-Saxons because of the huge rise in EU pensioners. </p> <p>A Scholefield, UK Independence party </p> <p>\u0095It has been people \"looking to Jesus as their guiding influence\" that has played a large part in challenging successive British governments on global warming, defence, third world debt and poverty. </p> <p>Rev Kenneth G Walton, Clayton le Moors, Lancs</p>",
  "The witch doctor says the women's prayers will keep the bombs away. The female soldiers flicking rifle catches with varnished fingernails say rebel forces will protect the town. <p>Zongo, in the guerrilla-held Equateur province in the north-west of the Democratic Republic of Congo, is preparing for President Laurent Ka bila's government troops to advance up the eastern frontier into rebel territory.</p> <p>This week Mr Kabila suspended the peace accords and ceasefire agreed 12 months ago, \"pending the amendment of some points\".</p> <p>Jean-Pierre Bemba, a 36-year-old rebel leader, was airlifted into town to boost morale.</p> <p>\"He told us the population and our army had to work together to defeat Kabila,\" said Jean Mogle, who was trying to sell flip-flops in the empty market place.</p> <p>For the past fortnight government fighters have been bombing Libenge, south of Zongo. Already Zongo's hospital is filling up with casualties. Balimon Bilinga had his elbow blown away while farming. More than 60 men and women have arrived with bullet wounds.</p> <p>But many of Libenge's 15,000 residents have fled in dugout canoes across the Ubangi river to the Central African Republic.</p> <p>\"They bombed the church, the school and the hospital. We had no choice but to leave,\" said Gerro Damango, who left with his family and pigs.</p> <p>While the refugee women from Libenge sat round fires complaining of rocketing food prices and lack of medicine, some of the men said they would return to Congo to fight President Kabila's soldiers.</p> <p>\"Under Kabila there were public burnings of rebel supporters. Women were raped by Kabila's soldiers. There was anarchy,\" said Jean Menda, a literature teacher from Libenge.</p> <p>Mr Bemba has the support of some business circles in Belgium and France, and is being courted by German com panies eager to exploit the area's timber resources.</p> <p>The Central Africans are nervously expecting a flood of refugees should Mr Kabila's forces reach Zongo.</p> <p>Their interior minister, Maurice Regonessa, said: \"The influx of such a huge number of people will have to be the responsibility of the international community, not only the Central Africans. We have very little resources to deal with such a problem.\"</p> <p>There are already more than 6,000 Congolese refugees in the Central African Republic. Makeshift houses are springing up daily along the banks of the Ubangi river.</p> <p>Mathieu Garba, head of the police station of Mongoumba, across the river from Libenge, said: \"We're getting around 300 refugees a day. We're concerned Kabila may try and bomb Mongoumba if they stay. We want to move them further inland.\"</p> <p>But the refugees do not want to move any further from their villages.</p> <p>Thousands have also fled into neighbouring Congo-Brazzaville. Fighting has stopped trade along the Ubangi river, which forms the border between the two countries, reducing food imports into the adjacent capitals of Brazzaville and Kinshasa by a third.</p> <p>But according to UNHCR representatives in the Central African Republic capital, Bangui, the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better.</p> <p>\"While external forces are involved in the Democratic Republic of Congo there is unlikely to be peace.</p> <p>\"We're expecting things to move in Kabila's favour and there to be more refugees,\" the head of mission in Bangui, Eusebe Hounsokou, said.</p> <p>As Makambaka Cieren prepared soup for her children from scraps she had gathered that day, she said: \"This is the third time we've had to leave Libenge.</p> <p>\"I fled leaving my door open. I had nothing left for anyone to take. This time I may stay.\"</p>"
