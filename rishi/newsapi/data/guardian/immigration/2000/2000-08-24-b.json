  "<p>The belief that overcrowding in southern England is caused by migration from the north is scotched today by a fresh analysis of population trends from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an independent research body. </p> <p>It shows that the most powerful motor of population growth in the southern counties is the flight of relatively prosperous families from suburban London. </p> <p>People moving out of the capital were responsible for 50% of the population growth elsewhere in the south between 1991 and 1998, whereas migration from the north, midlands, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales accounted for only 8%, the researchers said. </p> <p>Other factors explaining a 623,000 increase in the southern population outside London over the period were a higher than expected birth rate and immigration. </p> <p>The report said an extra 4.3m households would need accommodation in the UK by 2021. The demand for homes would fall disproportionately on the south-east, where the population was expected to grow by 50,000 a year, putting pressure on greenfield sites. </p> <p>But a continuing middle class exodus from London would not reduce its population, because it had a high birth rate and it was the main destination for migration from within and beyond the EU. </p> <p>London's migrant population was expected to increase by 31,000 a year for the foreseeable future and would include extremes of rich and poor. This would put pressure on central London house prices and increase demand for affordable \"social\" housing for rent. </p> <p>The report accepted that there had been some population drift from north to south. Net migration from the north and west midlands was about 30,000 people a year during the 1990s, although this was expected to fall. </p> <p>A more significant trend was a move in all regions from towns and cities to the suburbs and rural areas. This had not been one-way traffic. Typically 500,000 left the cities each year and 400,000 moved in. </p> <p>\"There is a clear life cycle feature, with net movement by people aged 15-19 out of almost all regions and into London,\" the report said. \"However, London is shedding people in all other age groups, and this net outward movement is on a much bigger scale than any other kind of migration.\" </p> <p>Those moving out tended to be relatively wealthy families with children, or retiring couples. </p> <p>Richard Best, the foundation's director and joint editor of the report, said: \"The decline of great cities is a national problem demanding action to regain and retain economically active people on the scale urged by Lord Rogers and his urban task force. </p> <p>\"But our analysis shows that attempts to achieve an 'urban renaissance' by blocking migration from north to south would be misconceived. Most movement from cities only takes people as far as the suburbs and surrounding areas. </p> <p>\"There is no escaping the conclusion that population pressures will remain intense in the southern regions, and that London will be unable to meet all its housing needs within its own boundaries.\" </p> <p> On the Move: Housing consequences of migration, edited by Richard Bate, Richard Best and Alan Holmanis; Joseph Rowntree Foundation; \u00a313.95</p>",
  "<p>New security procedures may soon make it safer to use your Visa card or MasterCard online than in person. From next April, all Visa card and MasterCard holders in the UK will have to give out a three-digit security number printed on the card signature strip during online and telephone based transactions. As an additional means of identification, they will also have to give their house name or number and postcode . </p> <p>The security number is calculated from your card's 16-digit number and other numeric data unique to your account. In theory, only cash machines, electronic point of sale machines and your card issuer's computer systems can confirm this number. </p> <p>Credit card fraud in the UK cost a staggering \u00a3189m last year, and is rising. </p> <p>Stolen till rolls or restaurant receipts are all that is needed for someone to take your card number and expiry date and then use your details for buying goods over the telephone or online. Alternatively, your card details can easily, and quickly, be copied by a less than scrupulous shop assistant using a simple magnetic strip reader costing around \u00a350. These gizmos, when hooked up to a laptop computer - which could easily be under the checkout - can record all of the existing data on your card. But they will not be able to record the new security number as it is printed on your signature strip. </p> <p>Thanks to the new security number, known as the card verification value, and the extra identification checks, Visa and MasterCard say it will be easier for online merchants and telephone mail-order houses to spot fraudulent card activity. </p> <p>Some UK online retailers, most notably Quip (<a href=\"http://www.quip.co.uk\">www.quip.co.uk</a>), the discount telecoms company, have already implemented the card verfication value and house number safeguards, so if you do find these details requested when you make a transaction over the phone or online, rest assured that it's for your own protection. If, on the other hand, you see a shop assistant or waiter noting down the card verfication value or other data from the signature strip of your card, alarm bells should start ringing in your head. Don't be afraid of asking for an explanation and if necessary calling for the manager. </p> <p> The \"consumer tips\" section on Visa's main website (which is at <a href=\"http://www.visa.com/ct\">www.visa.com/ct</a>) has a useful selection of dos and don'ts for when using your card at a retailer, online or at a cash machine. </p> <p>Many recommendations are commonsense, but some are less than obvious, such as cancelling a cash machine transaction at any stage if you see anything suspicious about the machine, a simple procedure that can save a lot of hassle. </p> <p>Visa also recommends that you don't let your card out of your sight in a shop or a restaurant. Although this can involve a trip to the till from your table, the minor inconvenience could save a lot of grief further down the line. </p> <p>Not all problematic transactions are fraudulent. Suppose you order a product online and nothing arrives at all. Or, perhaps, the product arrives, but your bill is for more than you agreed. Unravelling these messes takes time and effort, not to mention a lot of brain strain. </p> <p>Now a new web-based service aims to solve these problems by providing a service which allows you to prove to your card issuer - and to the online retailer - what really happened. The Card-Guard (<a href=\"http://www.card-guard.com\">www.card-guard.com</a>) service allows all types of e-commerce transactions, including Switch and Visa Delta, to be securely recorded on a your PC for later playback. </p> <p>The Card-Guard software sits in the background on your PC, recording any transactions you make. Copies of these transactions are then encrypted and saved to your hard disk. </p> <p>If a dispute occurs, you simply send a copy of the encrypted transaction to Card-Guard. The firm then allows you secure access to the decrypted copy. Basically, if something goes wrong with a transaction you can prove your side of the story. </p> <p>The service is free to use except when users retrieve their encrypted transaction records from the company's servers, for which it charges a modest fee. </p> <p>There are currently two ways of paying for this service: a pay-as-you-go model at \u00a35.50 per retrieved transaction or an annual subscription model for prepaid transaction retrievals. </p> <p>The first charging model allows users to test the service and, if nothing goes wrong with any of your online transactions, you won't have to pay a penny. </p> <p>Under the subscription model, users can pay either \u00a317.50 or \u00a335 a year for, respectively, 10 or 20 free transaction retrievals in that given year. </p> <p>Plans are also in the pipeline for the company to develop an approved retailers programme on its site. Under the programmme, users will be assured of a basic level of service from such approved retailers. Users will get confirmation of their orders by e-mail and several other guaranteed services. These are basic features which many e-commerce sites ignore at their peril. </p> <p><strong>Card safety</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Ensure that you get your credit card back after every purchase. If possible, do not let it out of your sight. </p> <p>\u0095 Never give your card number over the phone, unless you are dealing with a reputable company or you have initiated the call yourself. </p> <p>\u0095 If you feel pressured by a tele-marketing salesperson, be suspicious and never give out your account number unless you've decided to make a purchase. </p> <p>\u0095 Do not volunteer any personal information when you use your card. </p> <p>\u0095 After completing an ATM or Debit transaction, remember to take your card and, if provided, your transaction record </p> <p>\u0095Make sure that anyone waiting to use a cash machine after you cannot see you entering your PIN or transaction amount. </p> <p>\u0095 Never write down your PIN - memorise it. And never disclose it to anyone. No one from a financial institution or the police should ask for it. Nor should a retailer. You are the only person who should know it. </p> <p>\u0095 When selecting a PIN, avoid the obvious such as your name, telephone number, or date of birth. </p> <p>\u0095 If your card becomes stuck inside a cash machine, be suspicious of anyone offering help, even if they appear to be a bank security officer. Criminals can obtain your PIN by several means (shoulder surfing or straight questioning), then retrieve your card from the machine and use it to withdraw funds. </p> <p>\u0095 Do not leave your receipt behind - take it with you. Compare your cash machine receipts to your monthly statement. </p> <p>All the advice above was taken from the Visa website at: <a href=\"http://www.visa.com\">www.visa.com</a>.</p>",

  "<p>If all flesh is grass, then it makes sense to take care of the lawn. And all flesh truly is grass. If you could weigh every human and all their domestic livestock, the scales would tip at 1.1bn tons - and every ounce of this living flesh depends on plant life. Humans are not just leaders in the field, they and their livestock consume most of the field. </p> <p>Consume is the word. There could be about 270,000 species of flowering plants already named, and perhaps another 50,000 to be identified. And, says Peter Crane, director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London, around 30% of them are threatened. A quarter of them could vanish within 50 years. </p> <p>Which is why he is about to formally open a new kind of world bank to store the seeds of plants at risk for up to 200 years and push for yet more research into the green things that bankroll all animal life. Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and the food they eat, the medicines they use, the clothes they wear and the shelters in which they live. </p> <p>The odd thing is that after millennia of co-existence, most humans know very little about them. Only about 7,000 species of plant have been gathered or cultivated, a mere 200 have been domesticated and around a dozen of them provide 75% of the world's calories. Two of them, rice and wheat, produce - directly - 45% of the world's protein. Indirectly, of course, plants provide all of it. </p> <p>These brutal economic facts make research institutions such as Kew the keepers of the planet's future. It is not the only important botanical gardens - there is a network of them, co-operating in research - but it is the tallest poppy in the meadow. Its \u00a380m millennium seed bank at Wakehurst Place in Sussex is about to open to the public. </p> <p>It already holds seeds from most of Britain's flora and for the next nine years Kew's scientists will be out in the field collecting tens of thousands of specimens to be dried, and kept at sub-zero temperatures, to be taken out again and grown and gathered and frozen again - a kind of vegetable Noah's Ark, to save species otherwise doomed by human expansion into the wilderness. </p> <p>Many of them will be from the dry lands, the regions of the earth where plants are already most at risk and humans struggle every day for survival. \"Why should we care?\" says Crane. \"Someone like me who sees what we have today as the product of tens of millions of years of evolution asks: is it really rational to allow, in a space of a couple of generations, such a catastrophic change to occur? I think there is an ethical, moral issue there that has to do with our place in nature and the way we view ourselves and our general stewardship of the planet, these sorts of things. For me that is a pretty powerful argument. For some people that wouldn't cut a lot of ice. But for me there is a justification for pausing a moment and saying: is this rational? Do we want to wreak these kinds of irreversible changes?\" </p> <p>He has seen such changes already. His first business was palaeobotany. He worked in the Field Museum in Chicago on fossil plants. Flowering plants began to bloom on the planet only about 130m years ago, and soon trees related to magnolias, and precursors of the walnut and the oak were co-existing with the dinosaurs. There were palms, dogwoods, gingers and a diversity of other things. There were no grasses - the precursors of the wheats and ryes and cocksfoots that feed the world turned up only 30m years ago - but the shales and coal measures and chalk deposits kept producing evidence of an enduring and slowly altering kingdom, flowering into greater and greater diversity. </p> <p>From Chicago, Crane - born in Britain, educated at Reading, 45, and married with two children - moved to take over Kew and his view switched from the past to the future. What he saw - what any biologist would have seen - was a massacre of living things, a huge narrowing of green diversity. </p> <p>\"In the western world we are very insulated from nature, or at least we tend to think we are. Our day to day reliance on plant diversity is not the same as it is in other places,\" he says. \"But they reckon that 80% of the world is still reliant on plant resources for its primary health care.\" </p> <p>He has just come back from a visit to a co-operative project in the dry lands of north-east Brazil. \"They don't have the money to pay the bus to go to the hospital. If they go to the hospital they haven't the money to pay for the drugs they need. So they grow medicinal plants in their gardens and those medicinal plants help them through the less serious parts of their health care needs. They are very, very important. Intestinal parasites, for instance: there are lots of plants they use as purgatives. Curiously enough we are seeing the same trend here, with Chinese herbalists.\" </p> <p>Diversity pays dividends in all sorts of ways. An enthusiastic British gardener might have a dozen species of useful plants on his plot. An African or Latin American family might have more than 100: when the game is uncertain, it pays to spread your bets. The botanists went to Brazil to help, but they also went to learn. One farmer in the Brazilian drylands had found a new way with a neglected resource, Crane says. </p> <p>\"He was growing cattle, but they basically don't have enough water. So periodically he has nothing to feed these things, so he was very interested in how you get through the bad times. One of the things they had been working on in these groups was the use of cacti for the boundary fences. He was using three or four different species of cacti for keeping animals out of growing areas but what he had also found out was he could harvest these cacti as food for his animals. In the ordinary course of events he wouldn't be feeding his animals cacti, but when things get really rough he can almost coppice them, get the spines off them and have good, short-term animal fodder. It's pretty nutritious.\" </p> <p>The tropical wet forests are disappearing because of ruthless commercial exploitation of hardwoods and colonisation by desperate farmers. In the drylands, plants are perishing because people are struggling to survive: their cattle clear the landscape and the farmers collect what is left as fuel because they have no other choice. Greed and poverty are one set of enemies, human movement is another, as lusty foreign species take over in precarious ecosystems. The only way ahead is to work with the people who depend on their local flora - and collect like mad for the millennium seed bank. </p> <p>\"It's a fairly last-ditch approach,\" says Crane. \"It's better to conserve the plants in the field in which they grow, and they might support the eco-system they support, or on which they depend. But in a lot of cases it's a matter of saying: let's get these things into a safe haven, that we can then use in the future for reintroduction, before they diminish to such a level that either the genetic diversity has been stripped out, or they have gone more or less completely.\" </p> <p>A seed bank exhibition opens to the public at Wakehurst Place, Ardingley, Sussex (01444 894 000) on Saturday. The bank itself opens for business in October. Link: <a href=\"http://www.kew.org\">www.kew.org</a>.</p>",
  "While there was undoubtedly much confusion, hearsay and hype during the Kosovo conflict, to accuse the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and myself in particular of manipulating the facts is dead wrong (The propaganda war, August 21) <p>On the Kosovo-Macedonian border, reporters were usually denied immediate access to the new refugee arrivals at Blace. UNHCR would thus convey refugee reports to the scores of media gathered at a police checkpoint about 250 metres from the frontier. And we would always do so, as Audrey Gillan notes, with the warning that there was no way UNHCR could independently verify the refugee accounts. </p> <p>In the case of the villages around Lipljan, the similar reports given us by several refugees was later repeated by dozens more witnesses who were interviewed by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and by the media. </p> <p>Audrey Gillan cites the OSCE as a reliable source. I therefore suggest that she and interested readers exam ine the OSCE's own subsequent report (<a href=\"http://www.osce.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.osce.org)</a> on what it describes as the \"brutal expulsions and killings\" of mid-April 1999 in a cluster of villages surrounding the town of Lipljan - Sllovi (Serb name: Slovinje), Hallac I Vogel (Mali Alas) and Ribar I Vogel (Malo Ribare). The accounts collected by OSCE are very similar to the initial refugee arrival reports UNHCR conveyed to reporters at the border. </p> <p>Nearly 40 people subsequently told OSCE interviewers that between 79 and 200 people were killed in the above three villages between April 15 and 18, 1999. OSCE also quotes interviewees as saying that more murders \"and many cases of sexual violence\" were described in other villages around Lipljan through till April 20. </p> <p>OSCE eventually received a total of 39 statements, 35 of them from actual witnesses or victims, describing events in Sllovi/Slovinje on April 15-16 in gruesome detail.They concluded that \"a figure of 33 seems entirely plausible\" in Sllovi/Slovinje. Moreover, in a May 2, 1999 story datelined Blace, the Associated Press quoted its own refugee witnesses on the alleged killings of 32 people in Sllovi/Slovinje on April 15. </p> <p>And the Guardian itself carried news of the Sllovi/Slovinje killings on June 25, 1999, when it reported the arrest by British military police of a man suspected in the April 16-17 \"massacre of 46 ethnic Albanians in Slovinje\". </p> <p>Ms Gillan implies that the refugee arrival accounts conveyed by UNHCR were \"exaggerations for very calculated ends\". This is unfair and unfounded. UNHCR prides itself on its impartiality; decades of experience tell us that refugees usually tell the terrible truth. </p> <p>Ron Redmond, UNHCR, Geneva </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095A number of crucial questions remain unanswered. First, how many of the 2,788 bodies exhumed actually shows evidence of being massacred and, second, by whom? Third, bearing in mind that the definition of a mass grave is one which contains three bodies or more, we are also entitled to know more about the conditions of burial. </p> <p>When the International Criminal Tribunal released its interim findings about exhumations in November 1999, no breakdown was given of ethnic origin or manner of death. Yet we know that some of the bodies uncovered were Serbs, and chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte had admitted that the perpetrators included the Kosovo Liberation Army. We also learned from the forensic team which investigated Istok that many of the bodies disinterred there contained shrapnel from Nato bombs. </p> <p>Carol Turner, Committee for Peace in the Balkans </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095Around 80,000 Albanians were driven from their homes between Christmas 1998 and March 1999. I was working in a rural part of Kosovo. A quick audit of my patients shows that in the six months before air strikes, members of seven families had witnessed 42 deaths of unarmed civilians at the hands of Serbian security forces. That figure does not include second-hand accounts, men in combat, or civilians killed by shelling. Most of the deaths occurred in small groups, and the bodies are conventionally buried in single, not mass, graves. I was just one doctor in four villages. My patients were terrified to leave their homes, and terrified to stay. They had no jobs and they could not till their land. </p> <p>Can those opposed to the use of force suggest another course of action that would have brought the violence to an end? I long to hear it. The \"non-violent\" use of sanctions against Iraq has cost far more lives than Nato bombing. Though, yes, the military intervention should have been conducted in a different manner </p> <p>There are more significant questions to ask today: Why can't the international community invest the same financial and political effort that it put into military intervention, in creating a stable peace. Paying public servants decent wages prevents corruption. It is institution building, not premature elections that creates democracy. Further, fudging the issue of Kosovo's future status feeds extremists on both sides who continue to use terror as a means of creating facts on the ground. </p> <p>Finally, how is reconciliation possible without an end to impunity and the arrest of those most responsible? </p> <p>Dr Lynne Jones, Cambridge <a href=\"mailto:lmj21@cam.ac.uk\">lmj21@cam.ac.uk </a></p>",
  "Your front-page headline and first paragraph yesterday (Polar data left unused) give the false impression that data on ice thickness released to us by the Navy are lying unused for lack of funding from Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) for data processing. The comment which I made to your reporter was that we have received funding for 18 months to begin the processing of these data, with the likelihood that further funding may follow. <p>It is certainly the case that the vital task of collecting and processing critical data on global change requires long-term funding support, rather than short-term grants, because of the need for salary support to retain the skills of experienced people in a research team, and the fact that the changes being mapped are progressive and require successive field expeditions for their measurement. In this respect there has been a problem with funding agencies (not just NERC), which tend to shy away from long-term support for such areas of research. It is fair to say that these attitudes are changing. </p> <p>Dr Peter Wadhams, Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge</p>",
  "<p>Try to land on the surface of the moon or Mars, and the force of gravity will bring you in uncomfortably fast. That makes retrorockets necessary, or some other mechanism to cushion the impact. But landing on an asteroid or comet presents the converse problem: the target's mass is too low to generate any substantial gravitational pull, and so you may simply float off. </p> <p>Up until now this has only been a concern for Hollywood scriptwriters (as in the movies Deep Impact and Armageddon) and they tend to circumvent the problem by ignoring the laws of physics. But now there are plans to send various spacecraft to explore the surfaces of asteroids and comets, and so a real scientific fix is needed. </p> <p>The American Near-Shoemaker probe was placed in orbit around an asteroid called Eros six months ago. Eros, at 20 miles across, is fairly large as such things go, and so exerts sufficient gravitational pull for Near's masters to work against, letting their satellite circuit this rocky body and move in and out to take a closer look. Eventually they will let Near-Shoemaker drop down low, and perhaps nestle into the dusty surface of Eros. Barring some disaster with its thrusters, the probe will make a soft landing. </p> <p>Due for launch in 2003, but taking eight years to get to its prime target, is the European Space Agency's Rosetta probe. When it eventually approaches comet Wirtanen in 2011, the mother craft will drop a module named RoLand. The comet is small, and so has low gravity. In addition to that, ice and other volatile materials sublimating from the surface of a comet produce an expanding vapour cloud, which could push RoLand away. The trick will be first to get down to the surface, and then to grapple with it, or anchor itself down. That accomplished, samples will be taken and the behaviour of the comet monitored as it comes closer to the sun over the following two years. </p> <p>Before Rosetta gets to its comet, Japan plans to send a probe to perform a cosmic pirouette with a near-earth asteroid. Both the spacecraft and the asteroid have names that are hardly prosaic: the former is called Muses-C, while the latter is stored as 1998 SF36 in the astronomers' data banks. </p> <p>The asteroid will eventually be given a more memorable name. It was discovered by an American search team from New Mexico in late 1998, and eventually it will have its orbit determined with sufficient precision to allow a proper moniker to be allocated. Astronomers don't like to give objects names until they are sure they have enough data so as not to lose them amongst the myriad stars. As the target of a space mission, plenty of telescopes will be keeping track of 1998 SF36. </p> <p>Muses-C is due for launch in November or December 2002, getting to its destination three years later. Two small landing modules are planned. One is a Japanese device named Minerva, while Nasa has built a tiny rover currently called Muses-CN; again, one would imagine that a more prosaic appellation will be found for it soon. </p> <p>This little critter is only the size of a shoebox, and so is often termed a nanorover (hence the N in the name). The plan is that it will navigate around the asteroid surface not so much by turning its wheels, but more by jumping like a grasshopper. </p> <p>Everyone knows that when Neil Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface, he spoke of a \"giant leap for mankind.\" Subsequent Apollo astronauts illustrated that by bounding for the benefit of the television cameras, showing that in the low gravity of the moon it is easier to take twin-footed bounds than to walk. On an asteroid the situation is more extreme, and an astronaut would be able to jump off it, never to return. </p> <p>Low gravity is a drawback even for a robotic system. It means that the tiny wheels of Muses-C would not be able to get much traction. Instead, the idea is that the pivoting front and back pairs of wheels will spring together to provide an upward thrust, pushing the rover off the asteroid with a leap of a hundred yards or so. </p> <p>In this low-g environment, everything seems to happen slowly. The rover will take several minutes to rise on its trajectory, and then gradually fall back to the surface. But it won't land on the spot where it started. Asteroids spin on their axes every few hours. During the rover's leap into space, the asteroid will have turned, and so the rover will land perhaps a quarter of a mile away, take a look with its tiny camera, and then jump again. In this way a wide range of surface locations will be examined and compared. </p> <p>But what if the rover lands on its back? Will it struggle to right itself like an upturned beetle? They got round that by making Muses-CN a reversible vehicle: it has solar cells on top and bottom, so it makes no difference which way up it lands. </p> <p>If a ride on a helter-skelter makes you feel dizzy, spare a thought for this poor little fellow. Repeatedly kicking itself out into space, and then slowly tumbling back again, its gyrations will make even the multiple somersaults of Olympic divers and gymnasts look trivial. But it does have the advantage of low gravity, and so no hard landings. </p> <p> \u0095 Duncan Steel researches asteroids and comets at the University of Salford</p>",
  "<p><strong> Four score</strong><br> Intel was scheduled to announce a top-of-the-range Pentium 4 processor at its Developer Forum Conference in San Jose, California, this week. The new chip, codenamed Willamette, has a new architecture, called NetBurst, which is supposed to provide better performance with applications such as audio and video streaming over the internet. It also has a 400MHz system bus, which compares with 200MHz on current AMD Athlon processors and 133MHz on the Pentium III. A 1.4GHz Pentium 4 is expected to appear towards the end of this year, initially in high-priced workstations. </p> <p>Intel is also expected to announce two new versions of its StrongArm chip, based on an Acorn design. StrongArm processors are intended for use in handheld organisers, mobile phones and similar non-PC devices. </p> <p><strong> Internet for dummies</strong><br> In the US, Compaq has finally launched its iPaq Home Internet Appliance, complete with 10in LCD screen, which was promised at the Comdex computer trade show in Las Vegas last November. Like Microsoft's venerable WebTV, the HIA is designed to get novice users on to the internet without them having to cope with the complexities of a personal computer. However, Compaq's device only works with the MSN (Microsoft Network) connection, and sales outside the US will depend on signing deals with internet service providers. ISPs will supply the $599 machine either free or at a hefty discount as part of an online package. For example, the price falls to $199 if you buy a three-year subscription to the MSN internet service <a href=\"http://athome.compaq.com/showroom/static/ipaq/intappliance.asp\" target=\"_new\">http://athome.compaq.com/showroom/static/ipaq/intappliance.asp</a>. </p> <p>There are already several \"internet appliances\" on the US market, including Netpliance's i-Opener. Several other companies are also planning to produce \"MSN companions\" similar to Compaq's, including Acer, eMachines, Philips, Thomson Multimedia and Vestal USA. America Online (AOL) is also working with Gateway to develop a similar appliance for AOL users, and Compaq is expected to produce another version of its iPaq device running Be Inc's BeOS operating system instead of Microsoft's Windows CE. </p> <p><strong> Palm springs</strong><br> Agenda Computing, based in California, plans to ship a palmtop computer that runs the Linux VR operating system in October. However, it is not designed just for geeks: it has a friendly graphical front-end like the Palm's, to shield users from the complex Unix-like operating system underneath. The Agenda VR3 has a 2.25in by 3.25in monochrome screen and weighs four ounces. It is powered by a 66MHz Mips 32-bit processor. Agenda plans to ship the VR3 model, with 8MB of memory and 2MB of Flash storage for $145. VR3+ and VR3s models will offer more Flash memory for storage, and a VR5 is expected by the end of the year. Optional accessories include a keyboard and a 33.6kbps modem. Agenda is taking orders on its website at <a href=\"http://www.agendacomputing.com/products/pre_reg.jsp\">www.agendacomputing.com/products/pre_reg.jsp</a>. (JS) </p> <p><strong> Mission possible if you make it snappy</strong><br> For five years digital camera manufacturers have been trying every trick in the book to persuade us to buy their models. </p> <p>This year they called in their secret weapon - Tom Cruise. Apparently, the sight of the diminutive action hero touting a Kodak model and getting hot under the collar about the whereabouts of a CompactFlash card in Mission: Impossible 2 has caused sales of digital cameras to rocket in the US. Sales are also up in the UK. </p> <p>Cruise's all-action intervention is actually very nicely timed. At the high-end, models have reached the point where they deliver very detailed pictures indeed, while in the budget sector brightly coloured simple-to-use cameras are on the verge of bringing digital photography to the masses. </p> <p>Prices have also dropped and the \u00a3100 barrier has been breached by one of the best-known companies in photography - Kodak. </p> <p>The big talk in digital camera circles at the moment is about the number of pixels each camera's CCD is capable of capturing - the greater the number of pixels in an image, the more detailed it is. </p> <p>Earlier this year, a host of makers rolled out three megapixel cameras. These models will be usurped by a range of four megapixel models that will be in the stores between now and Christmas. </p> <p>Improving creative and manual controls is also a priority, as is upping the gadget factor (video clips, built-in MP3 players and so on). The zooms on high-end models are also becoming more powerful. </p> <p>With the pivotal Photokina exhibition in Cologne, Germany, less than a month away, the big names have started to unveil their new product for this and next year. </p> <p>First off the blocks was Olympus, who this week announced the November launch of the \u00a31,500 Camedia E-10, which it claims is the World's first ever four megapixel camera. In addition to its high resolution, it boasts a 4x zoom, one of the brightest lenses on the market, storage slots for both SmartMedia and CompactFlash cards and a host of manual and creative controls. </p> <p>Also due in November is the \u00a31,299 Olympus E-100RS. This 1.5 megapixel camera's unique feature is the ability to capture up to 15 images per second - great news for those perfecting their golf swing. It also sports a 10x power zoom and 2x7 digital zoom, an image stabilisation system, and can capture up to four seconds of video with sound. </p> <p>Fuji is also targeting the enthusiast end of the market with its new camera, the Finepix 4900 Zoom. Due out next month, the model sports a 2.3 mega pixel CCD and a powerful 6x zoom. </p> <p>At the opposite end of the market, Samsung has high hopes for its just launched \u00a3250 SDC-80. This 850 pixel model comes in four fruity translucent finishes, including orange, apple green, blueberry blue and white. Other facilities include a 1.8inch mini LCD screen, a pop-up flash and a 4MB SmartMedia card to store the images on. </p> <p>Samsung has also become the second manufacturer to deliver a digital camera with a built-in MP3 player (Fuji got there first). The tiny \u00a3230 Digimax 35 Plus comes with a 32MB CompactFlash card which can archive around half an hour's worth of music. </p> <p>Kodak is expected to announce three new cameras in the next week that will go on sale in autumn. Top billing goes to a budget model that features a video clip facility and a USB port, yet sells for less than \u00a3100. </p> <p>Out in the US, and expected here very shortly, is the \u00a3400 Kodak DC3400. Pitched at the slightly more ambitious novice, the camera uses a two-million pixel CCD and features a 2x zoom. </p> <p>Other manufacturers, including Nikon, Pentax and Sony, will announce new models in the next few weeks.
