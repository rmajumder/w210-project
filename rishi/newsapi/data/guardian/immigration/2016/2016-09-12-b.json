  "<p>The man likely to be the Britain\u2019s last European commissioner has vowed he will act in the EU\u2019s interest, rather than be London\u2019s voice in Brussels.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/uk-european-commissioner-jonathan-hill-quits-brexit\">UK's European commissioner quits in wake of Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sir Julian King, nominee to become Britain\u2019s next and probably final European commissioner, said he would act in the common interest if confirmed in the post. \u201cI know the high levels of integrity and impartiality as well as European commitment that you will rightly expect of me,\u201d he told MEPs at a hearing designed to test his suitability for the job. \u201cI am genuinely not here to speak for Her Majesty\u2019s government.\u201d</p> <p>European commissioners are meant to act in the EU\u2019s interest rather than represent their countries. But as a career diplomat, who is likely to face greater scrutiny because of Brexit, King is expected to strive even more for impartiality than a politician commissioner might.</p> <p>King will play no formal role in Brexit negotiations. Instead he has been offered the portfolio of \u201csecurity union\u201d but had to convince MEPs of his suitability for the role during a three-hour hearing in Strasbourg on Monday night. The European parliament, which votes on his appointment on Thursday, does not have a veto but it would be difficult for King to take up the job without MEPs\u2019 support.</p> <p>Security has shot up the EU\u2019s agenda since terrorist attacks in Paris, Brussels and Nice, with recriminations about repeated national failures to share information, allowing terrorists to slip through the net.<br></p> <p>The EU\u2019s executive has vowed to create a security union \u2013 a host of measures to deepen co-operation on counter-terrorism \u2013 as a complement to economic union.<br></p> <p>Efforts to develop a common defence policy are also picking up speed, as it emerged that France and Germany are intensifying efforts for great military co-operation. According to a policy paper seen by Reuters, the EU\u2019s two largest founding members want to create a permanent joint EU command headquarters for civilian and military EU missions, although the plans fall short of an EU army.<br></p> <p>Security and common defence are expected to be themes advanced by the European commission\u2019s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, in his annual \u201cstate of the union\u201d speech on Wednesday. EU leaders are also likely to touch on these subjects on Friday when they meet for a summit without the UK.<br></p> <p>The decision to offer King a security portfolio is seen as a shrewd move. King stressed the UK would need to continue to work with the EU, regardless of Brexit. \u201cJihadi terrorists don\u2019t make any distinction between Brussels, Paris and London and don\u2019t make any distinction [on the basis of] the relationship a country has with the European Union.\u201d</p> <p>A former director-general of the Northern Ireland office, King referred several times to his experience countering radicalism in the aftermath of the troubles. He stressed repeatedly that \u201cthe most successful counter-radicalisation work is not done by the state, it is done by civil society actors\u201d.</p> <p>Currently serving as ambassador to France, King opened the hearing by making the first half of his speech in French, although he mostly spoke in English. Unsurprisingly for a top British civil servant, he said he had supported the government\u2019s remain position. But the EU had to respect the leave vote, he said, adding that he would not be \u201cgiving a running commentary\u201d on negotiations. </p> <p>The vacancy arose after Lord Jonathan Hill <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/uk-european-commissioner-jonathan-hill-quits-brexit\">quit his position as EU financial services chief following the Brexit vote</a>. David Cameron appointed King in one of his final acts as prime minister, as the UK is entitled to have a commissioner at the table in Brussels for as long as it remains an EU member.<br></p> <p>Several MEPs previously questioned whether the British commissioner should get any portfolio. But some may be assuaged by the fact that King would arrive at the commission, already steeped in the workings of the EU.<br></p> <p>Whereas his predecessor was an ex Conservative minister, King is a seasoned diplomat who knows Brussels well. He has served as chief of staff to two former British commissioners, Peter Mandelson and Catherine Ashton. Between 2004-08 he was the UK\u2019s representative on the EU\u2019s political and security committee. He is married to Lotte Knudsen, a high-flying civil servant in the EU\u2019s diplomatic service.</p> <p>In a sure-footed performance, the diplomat dismissed suggestions that his appointment signalled an attempt by Britain to depoliticise the commission or downgrade the job. \u201cI am not a politician but I have spent the past 25 years swimming in a political sea,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look to me like a dossier that is part time or second class.\u201d</p> <p>The tone of the meeting was polite, ranging over numerous technical policies, from EU data retention to wildlife trafficking.</p> <p>But the hearing showed that King could be caught in the crossfire of delicate questions. If confirmed as a European commissioner, he would become an architect of an EU entry-exit system that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/09/britons-may-have-to-apply-to-visit-europe-under-eu-visa-scheme\">could result in Britons paying to visit the continent</a>. The British diplomat also made clear he saw \u201ca problem\u201d if the British government failed to opt into Europol, the EU policy agency. The UK will be excluded from Europol\u2019s crime-fighting work unless it adopts a new law by May 2017, posing an awkward political problem for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit government. King said he would do everything in his power, without fear or favour to ensure EU member states engage with Europol.</p> <p>Claude Moraes, the British Labour MEP who chairs the civil liberties committee, praised this answer for showing \u201cstrong political judgment\u201d, arguing that a lesser candidate would have dodged the question. \u201cI was very impressed, he showed a deep-seated understanding\u201d of the dossier, the MEP said after the hearing.</p> <p>The strongest criticism came from British eurosceptics sitting in the Ukip-led and far-right group, who questioned King\u2019s commitment to Brexit. \u201cYou work for the 65m [British citizens] said Janice Atkinson, the former U kip MEP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/16/ex-ukip-janice-atkinson-joins-le-pen-led-eu-group\">who sits with Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right group</a>. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe any allegiance to this place.\u201d</p>",

In Canada more than 26,000 Syrian refugees were resettled between November 2015 and March 2016, exceeding its 25,000 target.</p> <p>Refugees who have come to Britain on the resettlement programme told the NAO that their experience had been largely positive and they had been warmly welcomed by local communities but uncertainty about their status had caused them some anxiety.</p> <p>Meg Hillier, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee, said that local authorities in the UK should be applauded for stepping up to help Syrian refugees in desperate need.</p> <p> \u201cBut already under-pressure local authorities will have to find over 10,600 childcare and school places and nearly 5,000 homes over the course of the programme as well as social and community support services. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-12T17:02:10/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries and in Europe\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-12T17:02:10/embed.html\">Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries and in Europe</a> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe need to be convinced that the government is committed to supporting local authorities in their efforts and is clear about its expectations and funding beyond the first year of a refugee\u2019s stay in the UK,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>The NAO report confirms that most of the costs of each refugee\u2019s first year in Britain is paid for out of the overseas aid budget. A total of \u00a320,530 for each refugee over their five years on the programme is being made available to local authorities.</p> <p>Local authorities told the NAO that the main reason they may not be able to take part in the programme in the future was a possible lack of suitable flats and houses or childcare and school places. An estimated 4,930 extra homes and 10,664 school places for refugees are needed on the programme. The Whitehall spending watchdog said tthat remains a risk to meeting the target.</p> <p>David Simmonds, the chairman of the Local Government Association\u2019s asylum, refugee and migration task group, said: \u201cThe focus must now be on ensuring families are well supported. Councils are and will be helping some of the most vulnerable families fleeing Syria who will need access to ongoing support from local services to cope with injuries, disabilities and to recover from the severe trauma they have experienced.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesperson said work would continue to turn the pledges of 20,000 places into resettled people: \u201cThis is a humanitarian programme and the level of funding enables local authorities to provide vulnerable refugees with a safe environment and the chance to rebuild their lives. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe ask local authorities to consider carefully whether they have the necessary infrastructure and support networks before a resettlement occurs and we will only resettle individuals to a particular area once we\u2019ve ensured these arrangements, including school places and housing are in place,\u201d they added.</p>",
  "<p>Britain\u2019s employers have refused to panic following the referendum vote, but new jobs are likely to become increasingly scarce as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/brexit-talks-may-be-most-complicated-negotiation-ever-says-minister\">concerns over Brexit talks</a> undermine business confidence.</p> <p>Recruitment agency Manpower said that, on the surface, the EU referendum had done little to dampen firms\u2019 immediate recruitment plans. Official figures show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/uk-unemployment-claimant-count-falls-after-brexit\">employment is steady and the number of people claiming jobseeker\u2019s allowance is falling</a>.</p> <p>However, Manpower said the UK jobs market was \u201cskating on thin ice\u201d, with cracks starting to appear in many areas of the economy. </p> <p>A survey of more than 2,100 employers showed that companies in business and financial services, construction and utilities were less optimistic than before the referendum, while prospects also fell in manufacturing. </p> <p>Employers in several sectors said they were concerned that key staff would be affected by a block on EU workers staying in the UK.</p> <p>The survey chimes with a raft of similar reports showing that employers are nervous about Brexit negotiations that could see the UK leave the single market and impose strict limits on EU workers coming to Britain.</p> <p>The ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said signs of a post-referendum recovery should be treated with caution because a <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/sep/01/uk-factories-bounce-back-brexit-shock-eu-referendum-manufacturing-sector\">rebound in August</a> only made up for <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/jul/22/britains-economy-shrinking-at-fastest-rate-since-2009-says-survey\">ground lost in July</a>.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhile the news is encouraging, we believe it has no bearing on the cloudy longer-term outlook for the UK economy,\u201d said Sophie Tahiri, an economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings.<br></p> <p>An expansion over the next few months could be viewed as the economy returning to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, but this may prove to be premature or even a mirage, she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe uncertainty surrounding the UK\u2019s future outside of the EU \u2013 and the associated economic risks, which we think are pronounced and predominantly skewed to the downside \u2013 will gradually take its toll, particularly on investment, as businesses start dealing with the new Brexit reality,\u201d Tahiri said.</p> <p>Manpower said the government\u2019s austerity cuts were also taking their toll, cutting the number of jobs in the public sector, especially in local government.</p> <p>\u201cConducted in the weeks following the referendum, the survey shows that while UK job prospects have held firm, cracks in the ice are appearing, with six out of nine sectors surveyed reporting a fall in jobs optimism,\u201d the report said. </p> <p>Mark Cahill, Manpower\u2019s UK managing director, said: \u201cAfter the initial shock of Brexit, we\u2019re entering a new phase of prolonged economic uncertainty.

Looking out on the cold fresh waters of Encounter Bay, the seaside community of Victor Harbor is located around an hour\u2019s drive south of Adelaide. The town\u2019s way of life and economy revolve around the ocean.</p> <p>In the course of an afternoon, I get some sense of just how wonderful Victor Harbor can be. South Australian <a href=\"http://www.sustainableseafood.org.au/fish.php/1/51/king-george-whiting\">King George whiting </a>and chips for lunch at a pub is followed by a short drive up the coast where, at Bashem Beach, we happen to see a couple of <a href=\"http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/wildlife/animals/whales/southern-right-whale\">southern right whales</a> gambolling on the surface.</p> <p>At one of the lookouts a middle-aged woman tells me with a broad grin that she lives in Adelaide but \u201ckeeps coming back to Victor\u201d because it is the best place in the world. On the beach in the late afternoon a couple hold hands and kiss. Further along, a man sets up for some late afternoon fishing and makes his hopeful first cast into the waves.</p> <p>Victor Harbor\u2019s city council is evidently <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGBuEM4vgTU\">worried</a> about the threat posed by BP\u2019s plans. In his official submission to the Australian Senate, City of Victor Harbor CEO Graeme Maxwell <a href=\"file:///Users/dritter/Downloads/Oil%20or%20Gas%20Production%20-%20sub12.pdf\">warned</a> that BP\u2019s drilling plans represented a high risk to both the values and economy of the coastal community.</p> <p>BP are keeping their own modelling secret, but analysis of oil spill trajectories in the Great Australian Bight commissioned by the Wilderness Society <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/17/bp-application-drill-oil-in-great-australian-bight-rejected-for-second-time\">shows</a> the impact not only extending across South Australia but to Victoria and Tasmania.</p> <p>BP\u2019s recklessness was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/04/bp-reckless-conduct-oil-spill-judge-rules\">major cause</a> of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. In April 2014, Louisiana District Judge Carl Barbier found that their negligence was the single greatest reason for the disaster, showing \u201can extreme deviation from the standard of care and a conscious disregard of known risks\u201d.

The remaining $112m was spent on other programs including the widely criticised Cambodia agreement and other efforts to find a third-party resettlement option.</p> <p>The costs were based on the estimated 32,000 men, women and children in the asylum seeker processing system.</p> <p>\u201cThe current system is unsustainable,\u201d Breeze told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely expensive, it\u2019s causing grave harm, it\u2019s complicated and it\u2019s opaque and difficult to assess its efficacy, cost and value for money.\u201d</p> <p>Breeze said it was difficult to identify expenditures and attribute them because the total suite of \u201cpolicies of deterrence\u201d was spread across multiple agencies and lacked full transparency.</p> <p>\u201cI think we do have a particular issue here, and it\u2019s one of the areas that organisations such as ourselves have been really encouraging government to increase their disclosure of information,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The report said the true cost was likely to be much greater than the $9.6bn, once the costs of the government maintaining and defending its policy in courts and parliamentary inquiries and of workplace compensation incidents were factored in. </p> <p>\u201cIn combination, the opacity of the true human and economic costs of Australia\u2019s policies mean that Australia\u2019s taxpayers and voters are being asked to judge the merits of a policy response, without having all the facts on the table,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The human cost of Australia\u2019s immigration policy, particularly the mental and physical harm to those held in detention, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/nauru-files\">had been widely reported</a> and subject to at least 10 inquiries, but there was very little known about what happened to people who were turned back, the report found.<br></p> <p>The head of Operation Sovereign Borders, Major General Andrew Bottrell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/09/sovereign-borders-chief-argues-hiding-asylum-seeker-boat-turnbacks-essential-for-security\">argued in court last month</a> that Australia\u2019s policy of turning back boats at sea must be kept secret to protect the security of the commonwealth, because the information otherwise helped \u201ceducate \u2026 potentially illegal immigrants\u201d.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s report cited estimates of as many as 7,000 children \u201ctrapped in transit\u201d in Indonesia alone, \u201cunable to access safe pathways to protection\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese children face the risk ongoing danger, persecution, discrimination and other serious harms and challenges while remaining in their home countries or countries of first asylum or transit,\u201d said the report.</p> <p>\u201cThe narrative in Australia often ends with that three-word- slogan around stopping the boats,\u201d Breeze said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve found there is very little information about what people are in fact being turned back to. </p> <p>\u201cWe have growing concern around the situation and the safety of people who have been returned back to their place of origin or where their journeys commenced.\u201d</p> <p>Unicef and Save the Children called for the government to \u201cpivot its policy framework away from bilateralism and towards the establishment of a durable regional solution\u201d.</p> <p>The report made nine recommendations for the Australian government.</p> <p>It said the government should immediately:</p> <ul> <li>Publicly affirm its commitment to the UN refugee convention</li> <li>Publicly commit to a timeline of resettlement for those on Nauru and Manus Island in an \u201cappropriate\u201d third country</li> <li>Legislate against detaining children and find alternatives</li> <li>Normalise resettlement processes with Indonesia, including revoking the ban on resettling refugees who arrived there after July 2014</li> <li>Commit to fiscal transparency on the policy costs and hold a full audit</li> </ul> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/10/liberal-mp-says-australias-refugee-program-one-of-the-worlds-best\">Liberal MP says Australia's refugee program one of the world's best</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And within three years:</p> <ul> <li>Increase the humanitarian intake to a flexible 30,000</li> <li>Support the establishment of a regional refugee protection framework in south-east Asia</li> <li>Phase out boat turnbacks and reinvest offshore detention funding the search and rescue operations</li> <li>Improve access to non-humanitarian migration options for asylum seekers</li> </ul> <p>\u201cThis report is building a case for serious investment in a regional refugee protection framework as a much more proactive policy measure than what we\u2019ve got,\u201d Breeze said.</p>",
  "<p>Confident assertions are being made about what will happen to the City after Brexit. Sir Charlie Bean, former deputy governor of the Bank of England, said last week that he had \u201cabsolutely no doubt at all\u201d that euro-denominated clearing of interest rate derivatives would be moved into the European Union.</p> <p>Then chancellor Philip Hammond said the exact opposite, suggesting the EU would be foolish to attempt such a manoeuvre because it would only hand business to New York. London, Hammond argued, benefits from economies of scale that EU countries shouldn\u2019t try to smash out of \u201cnarrow and hypothetical national advantage\u201d.</p> <p>Such arguments go to the heart of the debate about the wisdom of allowing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/04/lse-shareholders-expected-to-back-deutsche-borse-merger-london-stock-exchange\">London Stock Exchange to merge with Deutsche B\u00f6rse</a>, a \u00a324bn deal that now faces about six months of regulatory scrutiny.</p> <p>Before the vote for Brexit, the pitch from the pair was straightforward, almost compelling. The duo would be a European powerhouse to compete with the big US houses, led by ICE (owner of the New York Stock Exchange), and oil the wheels of the European economy. All that was required was for both sides to accept a new structure in which the holding company would be based in London but local regulators would continue to oversee local entities as if nothing had changed.</p> <p>The structure is clever and shareholders duly approved the terms, so now it\u2019s up to the regulators and politicians to protest if they wish. The European commission will fret about the possible loss of competition. The specific UK worry, however, is obvious: if, despite Hammond\u2019s advice, EU governments try to slice off chunks of City business, are their chances improved by the LSE/Deutsche merger?</p> <p>Hammond\u2019s relaxed stance is understandable up to a point. The Frankfurt-based European Central Bank has always been infuriated that London dominates euro-denominated trading but it has lost one court battle on the matter and, say most lawyers, the UK\u2019s exit from the EU wouldn\u2019t alter the basis of the relevant judgment. What\u2019s more, sensible EU business folk might complain if Berlin or Paris tried to undermine London; they would worry that the price of capital could go up for them.</p> <p>All the same, Bean\u2019s warning shouldn\u2019t be dismissed lightly, or without proper scrutiny. It\u2019s very odd, for example, that Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, is in charge of studying market infrastructure for Baroness Vadera\u2019s post-Brexit financial services taskforce; as an architect of the Deutsche deal, he\u2019s hardly impartial.</p> <p>What\u2019s needed is a specific national interest study. If it concludes that the merger should be paused until the terms of Brexit are decided and proper assessments can be made, so be it. The Deutsche/LSE deal is too important to the City to be waved through on the merry assumption that things will probably work out OK in the end.</p> <h2>Who are the UK\u2019s fat executives?</h2> <p>International trade secretary Liam Fox, if he had wanted to attack <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/09/fat-and-lazy-britain-is-ill-prepared-to-secure-future-outside-eu-says-fox\">the UK\u2019s \u201clazy\u201d business culture</a> seriously, could have pointed to the UK\u2019s large balance of trade deficit and compared it with Germany\u2019s surplus.</p> <p>Fox didn\u2019t do that, however. Maybe there were two reasons why. First, successful German exporters tend to enjoy more financial support from local and central government, which doesn\u2019t suit Fox\u2019s agenda. Second, the UK\u2019s exports of goods and services per capita are the third highest in the G7, after Germany and Canada, as economist Andrew Sentance pointed out.</p> <p>Downing Street <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/theresa-may-declines-to-endorse-liam-fox-attack-on-fat-and-lazy-uk-firms\">declined to endorse</a> Fox\u2019s remarks. That was wise. Theresa May, let\u2019s hope, will go further and invite Fox to shame those \u201cfat\u201d UK executives he thinks play golf on Friday afternoons instead of negotiating export deals. If the golf line was a throwaway, let\u2019s hear about all the deals Fox thinks could have been done. Without evidence, his generalisations are absurd.</p> <h2>Exit Shafik</h2> <p>Deputy governors of the Bank or England are meant to last more than two years, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/12/bank-of-england-deputy-governor-quits-nemat-minouche-shafik-london-school-economics\">Dame Nemat Shafik\u2019s escape</a> to the London School of Economics is big news in the small world of central banking.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to detect any falling-out in the glowing tribute from governor Mark Carney. And the Bank\u2019s review of fair and effective markets, overseen by Shafik, received generally favourable reviews. So one assumes she really does find the pull of academia too great. </p> <p>Yet it would be struggle to say Shafik has established a high profile. When she arrived from the IMF in August 2014, some people thought Carney had hired a potential successor; it\u2019s been a while since that theory was aired.</p>",
  "<p>On Sunday afternoon, Hillary Clinton\u2019s doctor revealed that she had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">diagnosed with pneumonia</a> two days earlier. The admission came after she was filmed stumbling into her van after leaving a 9/11 memorial ceremony early. Pneumonia is a serious illness, but it can be treated with antibiotics.</p> <p>The incident divided opinion along familiar lines: for the Trumpian right it was confirmation that Hillary is sickly, perhaps far more than she lets on. Some Clinton supporters railed against the press\u2019s obsession with her health, arguing that it feeds conspiracy theories \u2013 and why on earth should it matter?</p> <p>Of course a presidential candidate\u2019s health matters. Both Trump and Clinton can rightly expect scrutiny of their records and fitness for office. But the press also has a duty to place medical problems in perspective.</p> <p>The effects of the illness may last a few more days, or a month. And the coming hours will be utterly dominated by coverage of it. But the next president is going to be elected for at least four years. Hillary Clinton is sick right now, but her opponent has flaws that won\u2019t disappear with a course of pills. Here\u2019s a reminder of some of the factors that should weigh heavier than a bout of pneumonia. </p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s attitude to climate change</h2> <p>The Republican candidate has said he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/26/donald-trump-environmental-policy-climate-change-keystone-xl\">withdraw</a> from the Paris deal on cutting emissions, and in 2014 referred to the scientific consensus on global warming as \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/418542137899491328?lang=en\">bullshit</a>\u201d, stating that \u201cour planet is freezing\u201d. The <a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/gallery/graphics/the-10-hottest-years-on-record\">10 hottest years on record</a> have all occured since 1998. </p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s religious test for migrants</h2> <p>In December 2015, Trump called for \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d. Since then his position has shifted somewhat; in June he <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-06-25/trump-says-immigration-plan-wouldn-t-feature-mass-deportations\">said</a> \u201cI want people that have bad thoughts out\u201d and his finance chairman <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/24/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-election-2016/\">explained</a>: \u201cIt is about Muslims from countries that support terrorism.\u201d The RNC chairman, Reince Priebus, has denied that this would amount to a religious test. </p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s support of torture</h2> <p>In February, Trump <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/trump-torture/\">said</a> \u201cTorture works. OK, folks?\u201d and has endorsed waterboarding, which was banned by George W Bush in 2006, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/28/donald-trump-ohio-rally-isis-torture-tpp-rape\">saying</a>: \u201cI like it a lot. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s tough enough.\u201d</p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s attitude towards freedom of the press</h2> <p>He argued that libel laws should be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">expanded</a>, so that \u201cwhen the New York Times or the Washington Post writes a hit piece, we can sue them\u201d.</p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s attitude towards women</h2> <p>Trump has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/08/05/donald-trump-on-women-sex-marriage-and-feminism/?utm_term=.6feaf23fe1e0\">written</a> that \u201cWomen have one of the great acts of all time. The smart ones act very feminine and needy, but inside they are real killers.\u201d He has criticized female public figures for their appearance and retweeted the question: \u201cIf Hillary Clinton can\u2019t satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?\u201d before deleting it. He also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQfJpTUYr2Q\">stated</a> that \u201cthere has to be some form of punishment\u201d for women who have abortions (he subsequently <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-30/trump-says-abortion-ban-should-carry-punishment-for-women\">released a statement</a> that, where abortion was illegal, doctors, not women, should bear criminal responsibility). </p> <h2>The prospect of Donald Trump as commander in chief</h2> <p>Retired General John Allen has <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/john-allen-donald-trump-226479\">warned of</a> a \u201ccivil military crisis where the military could be ordered to conduct illegal activities\u201d if Trump is elected. Former CIA director, Michael Hayden, has expressed concern about how \u201cerratic\u201d Trump is, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/michael-hayden-trump-military-226606\">saying</a>: \u201cHe\u2019s inconsistent. And when you\u2019re the head of a global superpower, inconsistency, unpredictability, those are dangerous things. They frighten your friends and they tempt your enemies. And so I would be very, very concerned.\u201d The Trump campaign <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/290227-trump-camp-denies-questioning-of-us-nuclear-policy\">denies reports</a> that, referring to nuclear weapons, he asked a foreign policy expert, \u201cIf we have them, why can\u2019t we use them?\u201d three times during a briefing. </p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s donations to public officials<br></h2> <p>Trump told the Wall Street Journal in 2015: \u201cAs a businessman and a very substantial donor to very important people, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.\u201d Trump donated $25,000 to Florida\u2019s attorney general, Pam Bondi, a few days after her office said it would review allegations made against Trump University in 2013. The review was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/10/politics/pam-bondi-donald-trump-donation/\">ended</a> without any action being taken. Bondi denies any impropriety. </p> <h2>Mike Pence\u2019s beliefs</h2> <p>The man who will be a heartbeat away from the presidency also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/07/14/watch-mike-pence-trumps-likely-vp-pick-question-global-warming-and-demur-on-evolution/?utm_term=.f3b8fe5e6687\">questions</a> the expert consensus on global warming, saying the \u201cscience is very mixed\u201d. He has refused to say he\u2019s convinced by the theory of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2016/jul/29/jerry-brown/jerry-brown-makes-true-claim-mike-pence-denies-evo/\">evolution</a>.

Loyalty, to the party and its leader, counts a great deal for him, more perhaps than it does for some of his predecessors. (Sir John Major has been broadly loyal to his successors, but Major\u2019s two Tory PM predecessors, Margaret Thatcher and Edward Heath, were notorious for their unwelcome backseat driving.) And today Cameron has been quite explicit about why he is leaving the Commons; while stressing that he generally supported Theresa May, he also said that he had his \u201cown views about different issues\u201d and that he did not want to be a \u201cdistraction\u201d.</p> <p>By distraction he meant \u201crebel\u201d. He is not going to be able to honestly support May on everything, and so he would rather leave the Commons than stay on and turn into Ted Heath. (As a former prime minister it will still be interesting to know what he thinks about government policy, but his views will be less relevant if he is no longer an MP and, crucially, he will not be expected to vote for measures he does not back.)</p> <p>Cameron insisted that this was not just about grammar schools and that his decision had nothing to do with \u201cany one individual issue\u201d. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/12/tuc-leader-says-labour-must-start-focusing-on-what-voters-want-politics-live?page=with:block-57d6c532e4b08465d44ffe08#block-57d6c532e4b08465d44ffe08\"> 4.25pm.) </a>This is almost certainly true. Here are five issues that probably helped Cameron come to the view that he was best off no longer serving as an MP with May as prime minister.<br></p> <p><strong>1 - Grammar schools.</strong> Cameron says there are \u201cvery many good things\u201d in May\u2019s grammar school policy, but his comments (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/12/tuc-leader-says-labour-must-start-focusing-on-what-voters-want-politics-live?page=with:block-57d6c532e4b08465d44ffe08#block-57d6c532e4b08465d44ffe08\">4.25pm)</a> also make it clear that he has strong reservations too. That\u2019s not surprising. \u201cIn 18 years of Conservative government, we didn\u2019t create a whole big number of grammar schools because parents fundamentally don\u2019t want their children divided into sheep and goats at the age of 11,\u201d <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6658613.stm\">he said in 2007.</a> There is nothing to suggest he has changed his mind.</p> <p><strong>2 - Faith school expansion.</strong> The grammar school aspect of May\u2019s policy is the one that has received the most attention, but the faith school proposals are very contentious too. Today\u2019s Times carries an article by Clare Foges, a former Cameron speechwriter, saying that allowing faith schools to expand without having to mix their intake would produce \u201cmore mono-cultural, mono-faith, mono-racial schools. More bubbles. More parallel lives\u201d. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/12/tuc-leader-says-labour-must-start-focusing-on-what-voters-want-politics-live?page=with:block-57d67696e4b07ac3d446b52c#block-57d67696e4b07ac3d446b52c\"> 10.39am.)</a> Foges was publishing her own views, not Cameron\u2019s, but he resisted the proposal that May is adopting when he was prime minister and so he may well agree with his former aide.</p> <p><strong>3 - Europe. </strong>After Britain voted for Brexit Cameron told MPs that it would be up to his successor to decide what relationship the UK formed with the EU but that he thought \u201cit is in all our interests, whatever the eventual decision, to make sure we are as close as possible economically to our friends and partners in the European Union\u201d. <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-06-27/debates/1606275000001/OutcomeOfTheEUReferendum#contribution-16062713000091\">Put more bluntly, \u201cthe closer, the better\u201d, he said. </a>With David Davis, the Brexit minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57cda570e4b0c2a396c06e89#block-57cda570e4b0c2a396c06e89\">virtually saying the UK will have to leave the single market</a>, and Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/11/boris-johnson-backs-brexit-pressure-campaign-change-britain\">backing what is seen as a \u201chard\u201d Brexit campaign</a>, Cameron may have already concluded his advice will be ignored.</p> <p><strong>4 - China. </strong>Cameron\u2019s government made forging a strong partnership with China a key priority. May\u2019s decision to postpone the decision to give the new Hinkley Point power station project the go-ahead shows she takes a very different view.</p> <p><strong>5 - Reshuffle. </strong>May was always going to appoint her own cabinet and ministerial team, but the extent to which she was willing to purge the Notting Hill Cameroons took many MPs by surprise. It would be surprising if Cameron was not at least a little disappointed about the way figures like George Osborne and Oliver Letwin were treated.</p> <p>One other point: not for the first time, Cameron is living up to his \u201cheir to Blair\u201d reputation. Former prime ministers always used to stay on in the Commons at least until the subsequent election because triggering a byelection just to avoid the fate of having to be a backbencher seemed indulgent. But Tony Blair set a new trend when he decided to resign from the Commons on the day he left Downing Street.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T16:18:42.499Z\">at 5.18pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d6c532e4b08465d44ffe08\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T15:25:21.350Z\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cameron hints he does not fully support May's plans for new grammar schools</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a lightly edited account of the rest of Chris Ship\u2019s interview with <strong>David Cameron. </strong>I posted a transcript of the first half of it a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/12/tuc-leader-says-labour-must-start-focusing-on-what-voters-want-politics-live?page=with:block-57d6be05e4b013613fffc7f9#block-57d6be05e4b013613fffc7f9\">t 3.50pm.</a></p> <p>(I have paraphrased some of the questions, but not the answers, obviously.)</p> <p><em>Q: You were opposed to a return to grammar schools. Resigning so soon after Theresa May\u2019s speech suggests you could not support that policy.</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em><strong>DC:</strong></em> This decision has got nothing to do with any one individual issue and the timing in that way is, I promise, is coincidental. But it goes to a bigger picture, really, which is whatever the issue, as a former prime minister being a backbench MP, I think, it is difficult just not to be a distraction, a diversion and therefore build a sort of reputation for yourself in politics that I don\u2019t really want to have. I wish her well, I wish the government well.</p> <p>In a way there\u2019s a link to the decision to resign as prime minister. The country made a decision, a decision I advised against but nonetheless the decision has been made. I want the government to successfully pursue that decision and to get it right. And as a result I think not being a backbencher but leaving parliament is the right thing to do.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: Do you or do you not support the expansion of grammar schools?</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>DC:</strong> There\u2019s very many good things in the policy. We actually when I was prime minister agreed to the expansion of grammar schools in areas where they already where. We set up sixth forms that were selective in our big cities as free schools, so lots of merit in the policy. But frankly I don\u2019t want to get into the whys and wherefores of this individual policy ...</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: This suggests you simply do not support the expansion of grammar schools. </em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>DC:</strong> I think there\u2019s some merit in the policy that is being put forward. My announcement today is not about grammar schools. There\u2019s no connection with grammar schools, it\u2019s purely one of timing. My view is, as I\u2019ve said, I don\u2019t want to be the distraction and diversion that the former prime minister inevitably is on the backbenches.</p> <p>So it\u2019s with a heavy heart because I love this part of the world, I\u2019ve loved being an MP, I\u2019m going to go on living here. Being a constituency MP is a great and fulfilling job but I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the best thing is to stand down.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Cameron hints he does not fully support Theresa May\u2019s plans to open new grammar schools.</strong></li> </ul> <p><em><strong>Q</strong>: You will be remembered mostly for taking this country out of the EU, won\u2019t you?</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>DC</strong>: I\u2019m sure I will be remembered for keeping that pledge to hold areferendum when many people thought that promise would never be kept but I hope that people will look back at the 11 years I was leader of the Conservative party and six years as prime minister of our country as a time when we did create a stronger economy \u2013 1,000 people found work for every day I was prime minister \u2013 and we did make some important social reforms ... and the Conservative party went from being in the doldrums and getting beaten to being a modernising winning force in British politics. But the historians will have to work all that out. I obviously now am going to be looking at a new life, but I\u2019m only 49 \u2013 I hope I can still contribute in terms of public service and contribute to our country.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: What will your new life outside the Commons involve? </em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>DC</strong>: I haven\u2019t made firm decisions, I need to look at all of that. The only firm decision I\u2019ve made is to leave the House of Commons and stop being an MP \u2013 as I say, with a heavy heart because I\u2019ve loved the jobs but I don\u2019t think it works for a former prime minister who resigned in my circumstances and with all the new government needs to do.</p> <p>Issues for the future. I\u2019ll decide them in the future and, hopefully, as I say, continue to make some service and some public service contribution to this country. I want to continue campaigning on the local, national and indeed international issues that were part of my prime ministership where I think we made some good progress.

Previously, over-subscribed new schools could only select 50 per cent of pupils on the basis of religion. Now it is to be 100 per cent. More mono-cultural, mono-faith, mono-racial schools. More bubbles. More parallel lives.</p> <p>It would seem the government has been backed into a corner on this. The Conservative manifesto promise is to create 500 new free schools. The hope was that a significant chunk would come from Catholic schools, but the church resisted. It takes issue with the 50 per cent cap on religious selection. Apparently, it is against canon law \u201cfor a Catholic bishop not to prioritise the admission of Catholic pupils\u201d. The chief rabbi also resisted the 50 per cent cap.</p> <p>I find secularist harrumphing about the pernicious influence of religion pretty ridiculous on the whole, but isn\u2019t there something rather ugly about this demand that \u201cwe take care of our own\u201d to the exclusion of others? Doesn\u2019t it stick in the craw that the state will pay for this discrimination? Government guidance says it is unacceptable for schools to \u201cpromote discrimination against people or groups on the basis of their belief\u201d. So, not OK to promote it, OK to practise it.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2016/09/tim-farron-a-plea-to-conservative-mps-its-neither-in-britains-interest-nor-yours-to-back-mays-grammar-school-plan.html\">Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, uses an article for ConservativeHome to urge Tory MPs to block the proposals.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Here is the killer stat: the Sutton Trust found that less than three per cent of grammar kids were on free lunches, compared with 20 per cent across the country.</p> <p>Theresa May addresses this by talking of \u201cinclusive grammar schools\u201d. But this is a contradiction: grammars exclude. Some complicated two-tier entry taking into account socio-economic background will have MPs post-bags brimming with constituents complaining that their child was denied a place despite gaining a higher mark than another child.</p> <p>And however \u201cfairly\u201d you try to select, you won\u2019t escape the fundamental unfairness of deciding ability at the age of 11. Streaming within schools works because it allows flexibility as children flourish at different stages and in different subjects. Grammars stream people for entire school careers, and beyond.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d66fd2e4b07ac3d446b50a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T09:06:10.631Z\">10.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Frances O\u2019Grady,</strong> the TUC general secretary, is addressing the TUC conference now.</p> <p>You can watch a live feed <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/about-tuc/congress/congress-2016/congress-2016-watch-live\">here.</a></p> <p>I will post a summary of the speech when I\u2019ve seen the text.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d66d28e4b07ac3d446b501\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T09:02:01.779Z\">10.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It is one year to the day since Jeremy Corbyn was elected Labour leader.</p> <p>Obviously the fact that 75% of Labour MPs backed a motion expressing no confidence in him suggests that Corbyn\u2019s first year as leader has not been an unalloyed triumph.

Rather than stop hosting, Mark decided to invest in some spy cameras, which he dotted around the house to keep an eye on future guests. That\u2019s when things got weird.</p> <p>\u201cBefore we knew it, we were spending every Saturday night in a hotel room, watching the livestream of our own home,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were watching people wearing our clothes, reading our books, having sex in our bed.\u201d Perhaps understandably, his wife thought this was all rather strange and left him. \u201cShe wanted kids, a dog, a car: the Danish idea of true happiness,\u201d says Mark who, undeterred, has expanded his Airbnb empire into a full-time business.

(Hasanbegovic has since emphasised that his current party is anti-fascist.)</p> <p>On Sunday, Croats went to the polls in a snap election, returning the ruling nationalist party HDZ as the biggest party, but changing nothing. Just 53% of all Croats voted: the likely outcome is a coalition of the same old \u201ccentrist\u201d parties \u2013 nationalists and social democrats. On the face of it, the country faces the same old problems. Unemployment at 16%, rising to 40% among the young; debt at 90% of GDP; the coast dependent on tourism, the interior sending migrant workers to Germany and Austria by the coachload.</p> <p>What\u2019s new is the return of nationalism. By 2013, Croatia\u2019s conservative nationalist politicians had made enough liberal noises to convince Brussels they could meet the basic criteria for EU membership. Since then, they\u2019ve been sucked into the surge of nationalist rivalry that\u2019s gripped the Balkans. Just across the mountains lies Republika Srpska \u2013 the Serb enclave created in the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Dayton Agreement in 1995, after a bitter civil war. Republika Srpska\u2019s leaders are threatening to hold a referendum on independence, which would blow up the deal that has brought peace to the region for 20 years.</p> <p>In response, Croatia\u2019s politicians have upped the rhetoric, with the leader of its centre-left party secretly recorded threatening to \u201cact to protect Croats\u201d if the referendum goes ahead, labelling Bosnia a \u201cfailed state\u201d and calling the government of Serbia \u201cmiserable people\u201d.</p> <p>If this were just a recrudescence of the Balkan ethnic conflict of the 1990s, it would be bad enough. But it comes on top of years of economic failure, amid growing geopolitical tension, and rising xenophobia in the face of the refugee crisis.</p> <p>Russian money has poured not just into Serbia but into Republika Srpska, too, together with increased diplomatic influence. Meanwhile, Croatia has joined the EU. As a result, the Balkans today have become a more clearly diplomatic and systemic frontline than they were in 1995, when the wars ended. The assumption that globalisation, economic growth and time would heal the region is looking more uncertain than at any point since the peace deal.</p> <p>If the Serbs of Bosnia were to go for their independence referendum, and Putin were to back them, the Kremlin would have a new pawn in the same game it is playing with the west in Syria, Ukraine and the Baltic States.</p> <p>Amid this, the intellectual life of the Balkans has retreated to a set of parallel compartments. There is the globalist left, applauding the partisan veterans in the squares, but insignificant in mainstream politics. There is the far right, whose main achievement in Croatia this year was to erect a statue to a convicted ethnic terrorist from the 1970s.</p> <p>Many people in their 40s and 50s live a post-traumatic lifestyle: getting on with business, family or early retirement, rarely speaking about what they did, or suffered, but gripped by an innate concern that the conflict might come back.</p> <p>Meanwhile, young people across the region try to live in a cannabis-softened, networked dreamworld \u2013 where electronic dance music or Pok\u00e9mon Go replace the national and political identities formed 20 years ago.</p> <p>If Europe wants to make the Balkans work, it needs to understand the limits of its current approach. It has lowered accession standards for countries in east and southeast Europe, in order to bring them into its enlargement project.</p> <p>Albania got candidate status in 2014. Bosnia submitted its application in February this year. Macedonia, which gained brownie points in Brussels for erecting a fence on the Greek border last year, is so mired in ethnic violence and rampant corruption that EU membership is impossible. Yet there are loud voices calling for its admission.</p> <p>The region\u2019s politicians, be they corrupt, chauvinist or simply incompetent, know that by ticking a few boxes on an EU checklist they can advance the process of accession with only paper reforms. The fact that many of the region\u2019s progressives, above all the young, yearn for EU membership is one more incentive for Brussels to look the other way.</p> <p>If the EU is to live up to the hope and trust placed in it by young people in the Balkans, it needs to start by being firm with the incoming Croatian government. All cultural nods and winks towards the fascist regime in the second world war must go. Ultimately, the EU must be prepared \u2013 as it has threatened with Poland and Hungary but not done \u2013 to trigger the Article 7 processes that can see member countries warned over inadequate rule of law, and ultimately be suspended from membership, or see their voting rights curtailed.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s leaders lost no time after Brexit in reigniting the common defence and security policy process \u2013 what the Daily Mail calls the \u201cEuropean Army\u201d. They are right to do so \u2013 for if the Balkans goes wrong again, Croatia as an EU member would have the right to call for support under the mutual defence clause of the Lisbon treaty, and all EU members would have the obligation to support it. But in the short term, what is vital is for western European democracies to engage with the Balkans and promote democratic culture and institutions. It was, ultimately, US diplomacy that imposed the peace of 1995. Today it is squarely the EU\u2019s task to maintain it.</p>",
  "<p>My colleague and friend Kay Everett, who has died of cancer aged 43, was a gifted lawyer whose campaigning work in immigration and human rights issues made her a powerful voice for the voiceless. She was also instrumental in establishing the public law department at our firm, <a href=\"http://www.wilsonllp.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wilson Solicitors</a>, where she was made a partner in 2012.</p> <p>Born in Swindon, daughter of Rosemary (nee Stevens), a medical secretary, and Brian Everett, who worked for Burmah Castrol (now BP), Kay went to Cirencester Deer Park school. Brian\u2019s work meant the family lived abroad for periods, and Kay took an international baccalaureate at the United World College of South East Asia in Singapore before reading law and Chinese at the University of Leeds.</p> <p>Following graduation in 1995, Kay trained at the City firm Lovells, where she met her partner, Anand Doobay, then joined the magic circle firm <a href=\"http://www.freshfields.com/en/global/\" title=\"\">Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer</a>, working in project finance, in 2000.</p> <p>It was at a meeting at the Ministry of Defence that Kay realised the City was not for her. This was in 2003, just before the invasion of Iraq, and there was an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/15/iraq-war-mass-protest\" title=\"\">anti-war demonstration </a>outside. Kay turned to her colleague and whispered: \u201cI think I\u2019m the only one around this table who would rather be outside with the protesters.\u201d</p> <p>In 2004 Kay followed her conscience and enrolled for a master\u2019s in human rights law at the School of Oriental and African Studies. Thereafter she volunteered at <a href=\"http://www.hclc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Hackney Law Centre</a> and became active in supporting destitute asylum seekers and migrants, reshaping her career as an immigration and legal aid specialist.</p> <p>Kay joined Wilson Solicitors in 2008, where I first worked with her. She had a wonderful sense of humour and her optimistic catchphrase \u201cwhat can possibly go wrong?\u201d punctuated the most tense legal dramas involving emergency removals and complex detention cases. She was a passionate fighter for the most vulnerable of clients, winning their trust, and giving them a place of safety.</p> <p>She helped to establish the public law department at Wilsons, and we were proud to appoint her a partner. Her kindness and intellectual rigour underpinned outstanding legal work. Kay was a wise mentor, helping numerous trainee solicitors with their careers.</p> <p>Over the years Kay campaigned on immigration and human rights issues. She gave moving evidence about the inordinate immigration detention in the UK to the <a href=\"http://www.appgmigration.org.uk/\" title=\"\">all-party parliamentary group on migration</a>. Kay was co-convenor of the <a href=\"http://www.ilpa.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Immigration Law Practitioners\u2019 Association\u2019s </a>detention committee and a member of the Law Society\u2019s human rights committee.

  "<p>Greek officials have agreed to deport a Syrian refugee back to Turkey, the first such move since the government changed its asylum system to make it easier to expel Syrians under a deal between Turkey and the EU.</p> <p>A Greek appeals committee upheld a decision against a 20-year-old man who landed in Greece in late July. </p> <p>The news provides a boost to the faltering EU-Turkey deal. Announced in March, the deal is meant to deter refugees from travelling to Greece by ensuring the deportation of most arrivals back to Turkey. Arrival numbers have fallen considerably but the deportation process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/turkish-police-withdrawal-greece-stalls-eu-migration-pact-unhcr\">has largely stalled</a>, causing European politicians to fear there may be a new wave of migration.</p> <p>Only a few hundred non-Syrians have been sent back to Turkey since March, and no non-Syrian has been returned against their will. This was partly because the Greek appeals system, mostly staffed by independently appointed lawyers and refugee specialists, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/syrian-refugee-wins-appeal-against-forced-return-to-turkey\">frequently judged Turkey\u2019s treatment of refugees to be sub-standard</a> and approved only a handful of Syrian deportations, which in any case were never completed.</p> <p>In June the Greek government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/17/greece-sidelines-officials-blocked-expulsion-refugees-turkey\">reformed the three-man committees</a> that judge asylum appeals, reversing the two-to-one balance of independent and government-appointed members on each panel in favour of the latter, in an attempt to speed up deportations. </p> <p>Rights campaigners criticised the move. They say Turkey\u2019s asylum process does not offer refugees basic rights such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/11/fewer-than-01-of-syrians-in-turkey-in-line-for-work-permits\">access to legal work</a> and often <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/06/war-to-sweatshop-for-child-refugees\">education</a> or healthcare. </p> <p>John Dalhuisen, Europe director for Amnesty International, said: \u201cThis ruling takes for granted that a Syrian will be fully protected in Turkey, and hence is fundamentally flawed. The new appeals committee should not have deemed Turkey a safe country for Syrians when all evidence suggests that international safeguards and protections continue to be flouted.</p> <p>\u201cWith lawyers and international monitors still denied entry into the closed camps to which this man could be sent, any suggestion that Turkey has suddenly overhauled its inadequate asylum system remains in serious doubt.\u201d</p> <p>In practice the Syrian man\u2019s deportation may not take place immediately.

The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=AWIDforum&amp;src=typd\" title=\"\">AWIDForum</a> brought together feminist activists from across the world to imagine feminist futures.

They were revised and published in August this year and cover themes of access, movements and public participation, economy, expression and agency. They state that a feminist internet is one where women and LGBT people have affordable and equal access and are able to create, design and use technologies to challenge sexism and discrimination. It is one where feminists\u2019 use of the internet is linked to resistance in other spaces and where the internet allows us to connect and demand accountability.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A feminist internet is one where online violence against women is taken seriously and addressed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In this future, there are more feminists and LGBT people in internet governance, making decisions and creating technologies, in contrast to the current male domination of this space.

There is a problem with ethnicity as well as gender, particularly when it comes to who runs companies. At Google for example, even though white people make up 57% of those in tech positions and 59% of the company overall, they hold 70% of leadership positions. This is despite women spending more time on social media than men globally \u2013 5.88 hours compared to 4.75 hours \u2013 and the history of women in computing and technology.

What does it mean when the primary spaces for so many public and private interactions, including activism, are owned by corporations from one part of the world, run by mainly white men?

One was a decision by the US army corps of engineers, the permitting body for the pipeline, to hold off on issuing permits to dig on federal land near or under the Missouri river above the Standing Rock reservation. The other was a landmark announcement that this fall, the government would discuss with tribes how \u201cto better ensure meaningful tribal input into infrastructure-related reviews and decisions and the protection of tribal lands, resources, and treaty rights\u201d and whether new legislation should be put in place to pursue those goals. It\u2019s at least an implicit and maybe an explicit acknowledgment that the permitting process for the DAPL fell short of meeting the Standing Rock Sioux\u2019s rights.

I spent two days in the Red Warrior camp, the big camp with dozens of teepees, hundreds of tents, and at least 1,000 people. It\u2019s across the small Cannonball river from the Sacred Stone camp founded this spring to catalyze resistance against the DAPL intended to bring dirty crude from the Bakken oil shale in the northwest of North Dakota to Illinois, then down to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico for export. Resistance has been catalyzed, and the world electrified by the gathering of participants from tribes across North America and non-native supporters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2791475badbb9e79ce6b4a0b27a8f617eabc91c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2791475badbb9e79ce6b4a0b27a8f617eabc91c5/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dakota protesters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, on Friday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Cullen/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Friday morning in the camp, I asked Dallas Goldtooth of the Indigenous Environmental Network what were the precedents for this. Sitting in the back of his minivan, as his small children milled about and the boy across the road came to shake his hand, he told me: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing, honestly. There\u2019s nothing that can compare. One-hundred and eighty different tribal nations have sent letters of solidarity.\u201d Goldtooth, who is Dakota and Dene, went on to describe the unprecedented support of tribes from all over the United States and Canada for this resistance, along with climate and environmental groups \u2013 a coalition with tremendous possibility for the future of both indigenous rights and the climate movement. </p> <p>The joy is widespread. The first person I met was a young Hoopa/Yurok woman from far-northern California, who told me this is the most amazing thing she\u2019s ever been part of. The next morning, a small man came up and greeted me, introduced himself as Frank, \u201cfrom right here\u201d, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux. Somewhere in the conversation he said : \u201cI wake up happy every day about this.\u201d I asked him how this changed the past, thinking of the losses the Lakota/Sioux faced over the past 150 years, but he heard the question differently. He mentioned that their old enemies the Crow and the Cheyenne came to stand with them, and that the old divisions are over. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2016/aug/25/north-dakota-pipeline-protest-pictures\">Faces of the North Dakota pipeline protest: 'Sacred land is who we are'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When I asked that question, I was thinking about what I heard from climate activist and environmental lawyer Carolyn Raffensperger, who had spent time at the camp earlier and has a long history in the area. \u201cThere are moments in history that can heal the past and the future,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a healing moment. It\u2019s extraordinary. I\u2019m hoping that it heals the river, which has suffered assaults that are unspeakable.\u201d Though climate activists oppose the pipeline, because it\u2019s part of the machinery to keep fossil fuel flowing and temperatures rising, the Standing Rock oppose it because it would tunnel underneath the Missouri river and threaten their water supply if it ever ruptures.</p> <p>The river is their only source of water. And as Raffensberger mentioned, it has been violated in many ways, including by the Oahe Dam in South Dakota, which turned a free-flowing river into a long unnatural lake. The Cannonball river used to meet the Missouri in such a way that their their turbulent waters turned out big round stones \u2013 which white people saw as cannonballs, thus the name \u2013 but now the smaller river sinks quietly into the lake, and the stones are gone and so are the forces that made them. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are moments in history that can heal the past and the future</p> <footer> <cite>Carolyn Raffensperger</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As Standing Rock tribal chairman David Archambault said in an editorial last month: \u201cWhen the Army Corps of Engineers dammed the Missouri River in 1958, it took our riverfront forests, fruit orchards and most fertile farmland to create Lake Oahe. Now the Corps is taking our clean water and sacred places by approving this river crossing. Whether it\u2019s gold from the Black Hills or hydropower from the Missouri or oil pipelines that threaten our ancestral inheritance, the tribes have always paid the price for America\u2019s prosperity.\u201d It will again, if the corporations and banks behind the DAPL have their way, but this may be a turning point in history; they could lose. </p> <p>That\u2019s what members of Native American nations from the California Yurok to the Michigan Chippewa and the other activists and supporters are hoping, and it\u2019s a tremendous hope against the odds or at least against the record of the past. Victors like to forget how they got their spoils, but the despoiled have long memories. In the central circle of the camp, some words and ideas recurred: that peace and prayer were the means here, that being humble mattered, that ancestors mattered, that this was nonviolent. </p> <p>I met an older woman from the Pine Ridge reservation, one of the poorest places in the United States and the site of some of the fiercest Native American resistance in the 1970s. She told me she had come when the camp was just beginning, when she saw seven teepees there. The next morning there were hundreds of people, and the occupation had stepped up a level. It kept growing, and there are plans to continue, though a Dakota winter may winnow out all but the toughest. When I arrived, the camp spread in all directions from the main entrance on the road. A long avenue of flagpoles lined the main road down what had been grasslands before, with nearly 200 flags from native nations around the country. Near the entrance was a sprawling camp kitchen, with mountains of supplies, indoor and outdoor facilities and open fires on which some of the cooking was done, and all of the gigantic vats of coffee seemed to be boiled. The grass was flattened and dried in some places, worn through in others, and after Wednesday\u2019s rain some of the bare places became mud wallows. People made camp on both sides, some in tall white or painted teepees, most in tents, a few in recreational vehicles.<br></p> <p>Horses were staked in the grass or kept in small corrals. People flew flags, covered their car in graffiti \u2013 \u201cWater is life\u201d or its equivalent in Lakota, \u201cMni wiconi\u201d, and \u201cNo DAPL\u201d were the most common slogans. There was a remarkable absence of brochures, leaflets and petitions, along with meetings and perceptible organizational structure. There was a classroom, a table where volunteers lawyers were available (they were also there to witness and represent anyone who might be arrested), sweatlodges. It was a village, though one without commerce of any kind or alcohol, drugs, or weapons. People chopped wood, fed horses, made coffee, visited with their neighbors, told their stories, came to ceremonies and talks, and waited to see how they could make history. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5942af12749a4a43b6b484e1b392d2c3c8542a14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5942af12749a4a43b6b484e1b392d2c3c8542a14/0_27_3351_2011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pipeline protest encampment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest encampment near Cannon Ball, where members of some 200 Native American tribes from across the US and Canada have gathered to lend their support to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe\u2019s opposition to the pipeline.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which left time on some days for cultural celebration by a thousand people from dozens of cultures. Thursday, the people of the Pacific north-west paddled down the Missouri river in magnificent boats they had brought with them. They were scheduled to come up the Cannonball about 3pm, and people were beginning to line the shore when runners came to call people to the central circle where ceremonies were held and information distributed. There, Archambault spoke about the governor\u2019s calling out the national guard, seeking to calm fears by saying they would be used for traffic management and would never be allowed to come to the camp.</p> <p>In fact, men in uniform from the sheriff\u2019s department and state troopers were already being used to turn people back on Highway 1806, which goes south from the Bismarck area to the reservation. I ran into them Wednesday afternoon, looking like they were combat-ready for Afghanistan, and they appeared to be turning all cars back not far down the highway from Bismarck. I took a huge detour through the rolling green countryside and got back without a mishap, but the goal seemed to be discouragement. On Friday, I saw more uniformed men turning people back about a dozen miles above the camp and then, again, further north, another blockade sending people back. There seems to be a concerted effort to prevent people from reaching the camp or to at least inconvenience them. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Archambault spoke, and then everyone wandered back to shore where the huge Tlingit boat and other crafts were arriving. Goldtooth had noted that the river tribes had who responded most strongly, groups who had fought or were fighting their own battles over water. The ceremonies were unhurried, with the boats passing by and then pointing their prows to shore and asking, with speeches of gratitude, songs in native languages, and jokes, permission to land.</p> <p>The fight is about water and rights. The Missouri is the longest river in the United States, joining the Mississippi at St Louis; any pollution caused by a spill from the DAPL on its current route would impact the reservation first but would continue downstream all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. It would impact a huge swathe of the agriculture and residents at the center of the continent. You could also note that the Missouri and Mississippi meet close to where a police officer killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, the event that prompted the formation of Black Lives Matter (members of which were also at the camp showing solidarity). The river goes onward to flow past New Orleans, where the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina turned into the unnatural disaster of a city blockaded and its citizens shot down and stranded by the authorities. Histories flow together. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"346955435e382557b2489e05f1308feb23441c20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/346955435e382557b2489e05f1308feb23441c20/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Native American protesters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women and girls from the Colorado River Indian tribes dance after arriving at a protest encampment near Cannon Ball, North Dakota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s happening at Standing Rock feels like a new civil rights movement that takes place at the confluence of environmental and human rights and grows from the last 60 years of lived experience in popular power and changing the world. This is already a movement with national solidarity \u2013 there were support demonstrations in San Francisco and Tulsa, Oklahoma, among other places \u2013 and a national day of action is scheduled for Tuesday. </p> <p>Many involved in the climate movement see it as a human rights movement or a movement inseparable from human rights. Indigenous people have played a huge role, as the people in many of the places where extracting and transporting fossil fuel take place, as protectors of particular places and ecosystems from rivers to forests, from the Amazon to the Arctic, as people with a strong sense of the past and the future, of the deep time in which short-term profit turns into longterm damage, and of the rights of the collective over individual profit. All these forces are antithetical to capitalism, and it to them. </p> <p>There is nothing guaranteed about the outcome for the DAPL, the larger movement that the uprising at Standing Rock has begun, and the connections it strengthens. It\u2019s only a beginning but it\u2019s a spectacular beginning and a reminder that sometimes the future is made by dreamers and warriors who come together unexpectedly. </p>",

  "<p>The happiest days of my childhood were spent in northern California, just north of San Francisco. We lived in a bungalow that had a small back garden with a lemon tree, spent weekends at the beach or picnicking in redwood forests.</p> <p>Most nights we ate simply at home, leaning on the sun\u2011laden produce from surrounding farms: avocados for almost every meal, oranges and lemons straight from the trees. Sometimes, we\u2019d walk a couple of blocks to buy a peaky-topped cup of chocolate frozen yoghurt, which we\u2019d eat on the spot. It was all pretty wholesome in the times before we started venturing out for our dinner.</p> <p>Later, as older kids, we loved those cheery American joints \u2013 the ones with a menu longer than your arm, where the waitresses wear name badges and bottomless coffees are served all day. The food was always American with a nod to Mexico, and as kids we loved it. Crisp potato skins, topped with a melting of cheese dipped into chive-peppered sour cream, shoestring fries and burritos. But what we loved the most were the quesadillas \u2013 two flour tortillas fried on the <a href=\"http://barbecuebible.com/2015/01/13/grilling-on-plancha/\">plancha</a> until crisp, then sandwiched around a very generous layer of melted Monterey Jack cheese, cut into wedges and served with guacamole and salsa. These triangles of joy were served as a starter, but were really big enough to be a meal in their own right.</p> <p>I make quesadillas a bit differently now, leaving the seriously cheese-laden ones to fond memory, along with chocolate milkshakes and knickerbocker glories. Instead, I use vegetables, pulses, herbs and even eggs to make textured fillings with pops of flavour that move from Mexico, to Italy, France, Morocco and back again. In fact, quesadillas are really just sandwiched flatbreads, which in some form or another you\u2019ll find in almost every culture.</p> <p>We make armies of them when we have a crowd to feed as they are the perfect vehicle for dipping, a great snack with a cold beer in hand, and are pretty fuss-free. A quesadilla allows you to play around and use what you have to hand. The main thing to think about is to fill your tortillas with something that will bind the two sides together \u2013 some cheese, egg or soft mashed vegetables or beans are ideal.</p> <h2><strong>Caper, herb and egg flatbreads</strong></h2> <p>This recipe is as quick as they come and is one of the most flavourful little suppers I know. It\u2019s loosely based on a recipe by my friend <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/near-and-far.html\">Heidi Swanson</a> (of the 101 Cookbooks blog). For the herbs, I used dill and basil, but mint, tarragon, parsley and chives would all work too.</p> <p><strong>Serves 2 as a meal, 4 as a snack </strong><br>2 eggs<br>Salt<br>A small splash of olive oil<br>2 medium corn or flour tortillas or wraps (about 15cm wide)<br>A few sprigs of soft herbs, chopped<br>2 tbsp small capers<br>A few cornichons/gherkins, roughly chopped<br>2 handfuls of freshly shaved parmesan</p> <p><strong>For the toppings </strong><br>200ml Greek yoghurt<br>Zest and juice of a lemon<br>Salt and black pepper<br>2 avocados<br></p> <p><strong>1</strong> Mix the yoghurt, half the lemon juice and all the zest with a pinch of salt and black pepper in a bowl.

Squeeze over the remaining lemon juice and set aside.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Beat the eggs with a pinch of salt in a small bowl. Heat a small frying pan over a medium heat, add a tiny splash of olive oil, then add half of the egg to the pan, let it set into a kind of pancake for 10-15 seconds. Now, working quickly, put one of the tortillas on top of the egg: you want the egg to still be a bit runny, so it will attach itself to the tortilla as it sets.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> When the egg has set, use a spatula to turn the whole thing over, sprinkle over half of the herbs, half the capers and cornichons and half of the parmesan. Cook until the cheese has melted. Repeat for multiple quesadillas.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> To serve, fold the tortillas in half and top with the yoghurt and slices of avocado and, to make a meal of them, a little lemon-dressed green salad.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd294bb673b6dd16a20b1ced7e725349585a7dd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd294bb673b6dd16a20b1ced7e725349585a7dd2/0_1772_4513_2708/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Squash quesadilla\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Serve straight from the pan with the tomatoes and a little salad, if you are making a meal of it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Issy Croker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Quick squash quesadillas</strong></h2> <p>The feta is optional \u2013 I often make these without any cheese at all.</p> <p><strong>Serves 2 as a meal, 4 as a snack</strong><br>Olive oil<br>A quarter of a butternut squash, peeled and grated<br>Salt and black pepper<br>10 black olives, pitted and roughly chopped (I use kalamata olives)<br>1 red chilli, finely chopped<br>400g tin of white beans, drained<br>50g feta (optional)<br>Zest and juice of one lemon<br>4 medium corn or flour tortillas</p> <p><strong>For the tomatoes</strong><br>200g ripe vine or cherry tomatoes<br>A small bunch of basil<br>A little balsamic vinegar<br>Extra virgin olive oil</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Heat a dash of olive oil in a pan, add the butternut squash and season with salt and pepper.

the timing of the poll.</p> <p>Monday began with a show of defiance by conservatives Kevin Andrews and Eric Abetz on the public funding question, and an oblique reference from the former prime minister Tony Abbott, who noted both camps in the plebiscite would require \u201cproper campaigns\u201d.<br></p> <p>This push was rebuffed immediately by Liberal Warren Entsch, a longtime campaigner for marriage equality, who declared he was \u201cabsolutely\u201d opposed to public funding for the plebiscite.</p> <p>Entsch also moved to quash suggestions that public funding for the yes and no cases had been part of any party room agreement about the conduct of the plebiscite. \u201cAny suggestion [public funding] was a decision or commitment made in the party room is absolutely wrong,\u201d Entsch told ABC radio on Monday morning.</p> <p>Before the cabinet deliberations, the prime minister was keeping his options open, telling parliament that any funding provided to the yes or the no case would be \u201cscrupulously equal and fair\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe details, nature and amount, terms of any such funding and the terms of the plebiscite are a matter for the cabinet,\u201d Turnbull said Monday. \u201cThen it will be presented through the party room processes and following that to the parliament.\u201d</p> <p>Fairfax <a

evening</a> cabinet was considering a date in February for the plebiscite and the following question: \u201cDo you support a change in the law to allow same-sex couples to marry?\u201d</p> <p>If Turnbull emerges from cabinet with a proposal to fund the campaigns it will make it almost impossible for Labor to back the plebiscite \u2013 effectively sinking the issue.</p> <p>The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, warned of the risk that teenagers could self-harm as a consequence of a strenuous no campaign during the plebiscite. </p> <p>\u201cLet me be as blunt as possible: a no campaign would be an emotional torment for gay teenagers and, if one child commits suicide over the plebiscite, then that is one too many,\u201d Shorten told parliament.</p> <p>In other developments on Monday with the resumption of the parliamentary sitting:</p> <ul> <li>The Coalition held a special party room meeting in order to read the riot act to MPs and staff about missing critical votes in the chambers after

procedural control last week, and the reading of the riot act at the special party room, the Senate lapsed into a filibuster for more than three hours because there wasn\u2019t a government proposal

But for those who prefer longer hikes, the 65km route around the <a href=\"http://cemovsko.me/2016/06/krug-oko-korita/\">Korita</a> is a must.</p> <p>In the city, don\u2019t forget to drink the famous fermented <em>boza</em> drink at Korzo bar in the city centre, one of the places most reminiscent of the old Podgorica.
