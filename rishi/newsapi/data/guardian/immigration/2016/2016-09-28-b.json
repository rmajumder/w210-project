  "<p>Shell and BP\u2019s pay plans encourage their bosses to dig for oil instead of investing in low-carbon energy and should be overhauled by shareholders, according to the campaign group ShareAction.</p> <p>Investors in the oil companies should use binding votes on pay policies next year to scrap short-term targets and reward chief executives for working towards the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">target set in Paris last December</a> to limit global temperature increases to 2C or less, the responsible investment group says in a report. </p> <p>ShareAction said international pressure to reduce the impact of climate change was an existential threat to companies whose business depends on extracting fossil fuels. Persisting with pay plans that reward old measures of success risk Shell and BP becoming obsolete and ultimately going bust, the report says.</p> <p>Large companies face binding shareholder votes on three-year pay policies at next year\u2019s annual general meetings under rules introduced in 2013. Shell and BP\u2019s policies will take them up to 2020 when pledges under the Paris treaty could be strengthened, making the votes important, ShareAction said.</p> <p>Shareholders voted against the \u00a314m pay package for Bob Dudley, BP\u2019s chief executive, and ShareAction said the pay policy votes would be a test of investors\u2019 resolve. Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, was paid \u20ac5.85m (\u00a35m) last year. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e242a0c3cf896c89315bfc124768a943ee423966\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e242a0c3cf896c89315bfc124768a943ee423966/431_112_3315_4141/801.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine Howarth, ShareAction chief executive.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine Howarth has called for BP and Shell investors to \u2018walk the talk\u2019 next year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Catherine Howarth, ShareAction\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cResponsible investors who are serious about climate risk have a crucial opportunity to \u2018walk the talk\u2019 at BP and Shell next year by pushing for remuneration policies designed make these companies commercially resilient in a low carbon world \u2013 and voting down policies which fail that test.\u201d<br></p> <p>ShareAction said bonuses were largely tied to shareholder returns, project delivery, replacement of reserves and measures that encourage oil extraction. Long-term bonuses were paid after a few years yet the effects of Van Beurden and Dudley\u2019s decisions lasted for decades, ShareAction said.<br></p> <p>ShareAction called on investors to push BP and Shell to develop low-carbon energy, remove outdated performance measures and reward bosses for working towards the Paris targets. </p> <p>Van Beurden and Dudley have said they support a shift to renewable energy but have resisted pressure to make a radical switch to their companies\u2019 activities, which have attracted increasing opposition.

  "<p>The aftermath of the 2013 AFL grand final was something like a wake for travelling Fremantle supporters as they trudged away from the MCG and down Wurundjeri Way towards their hotels \u2013 but the enduring image most of them took home was a nightmare montage of all those first-half misses in front of goal. </p> <p>Put simply, it was not just Hawthorn\u2019s excellence that won the day but also the Dockers\u2019 inability to convert their chances.</p> <p>The Hawks were by then September veterans, not yet swept up in their own dynasty but a side that clearly knew how to navigate its way around the MCG when 100,000 fans were whooping and hollering and the tackles were coming from every angle. By half-time they were 5.5 (35) to Fremantle\u2019s 1.6 (10), with key Dockers having sprayed shots on goal in every direction except straight over the goal umpire\u2019s hat. </p> <p>That scoreline didn\u2019t even factor in other missed chances that sailed out on the full. The Dockers bounced back admirably in the second half but they\u2019d effectively kicked themselves out of it by the main break. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/28/like-a-cork-in-the-ocean-dennis-cometti-bobs-up-to-call-his-final-afl-game\">Like a cork in the ocean: Dennis Cometti bobs up to call his final AFL game | Russell Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For this season\u2019s old hands Sydney, it\u2019s the kind of recurring grand final phenomena that might provide encouragement as they face the Western Bulldogs in this weekend\u2019s decider. Excluding the Swans themselves, here\u2019s some half-time scores posted by losing grand finalists in the last 15 years: 3.8, 1.6, 4.6, 1.8, 7.7, 6.12, 4.3, 4.6, 2.7, 6.7 and 4.7. </p> <p>Only Collingwood \u2013 with 9.3 in the first half of their 2011 loss to Geelong \u2013 can claim to have bucked the trend towards the losing team faltering in front of goal when the heat has been on. The rest lost in large part because they failed to capitalise on early periods of momentum and apply scoreboard pressure. So often this is the case for sides unused to grand final pressure on the MCG.</p> <p>But why can Sydney take heart from this and not the Dogs? Let\u2019s grant the fact that regular season goal-kicking form is not an entirely reliable indicator of how things will pan out at the pointy end and look across both the home and away season and finals, starting with the Bulldogs.</p> <p>Luke Beveridge\u2019s side has put in the following first halves in September: 6.5 against GWS, 6.10 against Hawthorn and 7.6 against West Coast. Their yips in the Hawthorn game \u2013 on the MCG, where they\u2019ve rarely played in the last five years \u2013 was what got some of us wondering about the potential they might kick themselves out of premiership contention, should the opportunity arise.</p> <p>You could argue that this theory quite simply applies to any losing side, of course, but something might be drawn from accuracy rates in home and away games the Bulldogs lost: 4.5 against Hawthorn, 3.4 against North Melbourne, 6.6 against GWS, 1.9 against Geelong, and 4.9 against Fremantle. Two other losses featured better efforts (6.4 and 8.2). </p> <p>The Dogs\u2019 four-point win over their grand final adversaries in round 15 was of course full of positives, because it showed they could hang tough against top opposition. But it was instructive in another way, and perhaps showed us their small margin for error in beating the Swans on Saturday: the Dogs kicked 5.3 to Sydney\u2019s 6.7 in the first half and ended up winning 13.5 to 11.13. </p> <p>So Sydney had eight more scoring shots than the winners and kicked poorly. It\u2019s a small sample size but suggests that the Dogs will probably need to nail their first-half chances. Sydney, on the other hand, proved the cliche that bad kicking is bad football.</p> <p>In a goal-kicking sense, the Swans have generally stepped up when it\u2019s mattered this season, overcoming their shocker against GWS in the qualifying final to beat Adelaide (a game in which they kicked 7.3 in the first quarter and 10.5 by the main break) and Geelong (the Swans were 7.2 at the first break and 11.3 at the half). Both victories were as much about clinical finishing as anything else. The Geelong result was particularly startling; Sydney seemed to capitalise on nearly every chance they had.</p> <p>And what are grand finals about if not taking chance when they\u2019re up for grabs? Sydney has on its side plenty of calm-headed forwards and sharp-shooting midfielders. Lance Franklin has had one of his better seasons in this regard, kicking 80.53, while Tom Papley (29.14) , Luke Parker (24.18), Gary Rohan (24.16), Ben McGlynn (24.10) and resting ruckman Kurt Tippet (17.7) all get the job done when they find themselves inside 50.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/28/matter-of-stats-assessing-the-six-different-types-of-afl-grand-finals\">Matter of stats: assessing the six different 'types' of AFL grand finals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s obviously a bit to like for the Bulldogs, too. They\u2019re not grand finalists for nothing. Tory Dickson is superb in front of goal, having kicked 37.17 this year after his remarkable 50.12 season in 2015, though he was uncharacteristically wasteful in both of the Dogs\u2019 first two finals this season and will be one to watch with interest early in the grand final.</p> <p>Jake Stringer\u2019s (41.22) fortunes will be more reliant on <em>getting</em> the ball than what he does with it, while Marcus Bontempelli (26.17) takes plenty of his chances and Clay Smith (17.11) is proving a big-occasion player, but there would surely be concerns about third forward forward target Tom Boyd (10.10 this year when he\u2019s been comfortable enough to take a shot) and some of the other bit-part players who\u2019ll bob up in front of goal and have to take shots.</p> <p>In the 2013 decider, Dockers stars Nat Fyfe, Hayden Ballantyne, Stephen Hill, Michael Barlow and Ryan Crowley had at least eights shots between them, and none could manage a single goal as their team went down. Last year it was the normally-sharp Mark LeCras, Jamie Cripps and Jack Darling who missed the kinds of chances that put the Eagles out of contention. </p> <p>Could it be the Bulldogs are undone by a similar breakdown in one of football\u2019s fundamental skills when the stakes are highest? The Swans will certainly hope so and history tells us that it\u2019s generally the fate of one of the side\u2019s out there.</p> <p>All season Sydney have battled against a perception that they are \u201ctoo slow\u201d, but among many fascinating sub-plots in Saturday\u2019s game we might be shown yet again that ice-cold nerves are sometimes a better weapon on grand final day than a pair of spring heels.</p>",

  "<p>Nobody would ever call Jeremy Corbyn a traditional party leader. His defiantly untraditional approach to politics delights his supporters and exasperates his detractors. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-conference-jeremy-corbyns-today-interview\" title=\"\">his speech to the Labour conference</a> in Liverpool on Wednesday showed some signs that the re-elected leader sees the need to face up to some traditional problems, while not retreating on the issues closest to his heart.</p> <p>Mr Corbyn sometimes gives the impression that, for him, politics equates with campaigning. He sees himself as the spokesman of a social movement and Labour as a party of social protest. Much of <a href=\"http://press.labour.org.uk\" title=\"\">his speech</a>, in which he claimed to be offering socialism for the 21st century, was uncompromising. Yet right at the start, he also seemed to take a less romantic tack. He said the heart of Labour\u2019s purpose was \u201cabout winning power\u201d in elections. He said Labour\u2019s central task must be to rebuild trust and support \u201cto win the next general election\u201d, which he said could come in 2017. Towards the end he acknowledged that \u201cthere\u2019s an electoral mountain to climb\u201d but insisted Labour could win by focusing on \u201cthe needs and aspirations of middle- and lower-income voters\u201d.</p> <p>These would not have been controversial things for earlier Labour leaders to say. In Mr Corbyn\u2019s mouth, they are at least a partial recognition, which may not be shared by all his followers, that winning power through the ballot box matters and has to be worked for. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/sadiq-khan-greatest-prize-labour-back-power-conference\" title=\"\">The London mayor Sadiq Khan</a>, who is no Corbyn supporter, gave a rousing speech to the conference this week in which he used the word \u201cpower\u201d some 40 times. Mr Khan\u2019s speech was a plea for Labour to focus on the core purpose of getting elected in order to do good for the voters. Mr Corbyn\u2019s speech seemed to acknowledge the reality of that.</p> <p>Mr Corbyn has had a good conference in very difficult circumstances. The party has confirmed its move to the left. He himself was emphatically re-elected. There is no immediate appetite anywhere for another contest. Across the party, all now seem to grasp that splits will get Labour nowhere. Yet Labour is a bruised and fragile coalition, and a leader who believes there may be an election in 2017 must do what he can to make unity more than a slogan. When Mr Corbyn appealed on Wednesday for an end to the trench warfare and for Labour to work together, it was not clear if that was an olive branch or a threat that his critics must toe the line. If Mr Corbyn and all those who cheered his words are wise, they will choose the olive branch. Wednesday\u2019s speech was not without weaknesses but, like the conference, it did at least allow Labour to move forward a little from the shambles of the past year.</p> <p>Mr Corbyn\u2019s speech was also better than the one he gave a year ago. It covered a lot of ground, almost all of it domestic. The humanitarian catastrophe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/aleppo-two-hospitals-bombed-out-of-service-syria-airstrikes\" title=\"\">in Syria</a>, though, was barely mentioned. Scotland was ignored. The NHS was discussed only briefly. Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/26/john-mcdonnell-10-an-hour-living-wage-plan-labour-conference\" title=\"\">John McDonnell\u2019s speech on Monday</a>, it was fuller of aspirations and goals than of detail on means and costs. If there is an election next year, Labour will have to remedy that very fast. Like Mr McDonnell\u2019s, the speech also suffered from the lack of a large narrative centred on the big current questions facing the country, above all Brexit.</p> <p>The best things in the speech were practical pledges: allowing councils to borrow to build; prioritising research and development; a boost for the arts in schools. These are desirable things. But the devil really is in the detail here. A new deal to rebuild Britain\u2019s infrastructure and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyn-tax-business-national-education-service-labour-conference\" title=\"\">boost education</a> sounds wonderful. But there was nothing in the speech, nor any detailed briefing afterwards, to suggest that the plans are either advanced or costed. Repealing the vindictive Trade Union Act 2016 is sensible too. But it is what Labour would put in its place that matters.</p> <p>Nor did Mr Corbyn talk about priorities. The biggest issues facing Britain are Brexit and immigration. No party will win an election without credible strategies on these interconnected issues. Mr Corbyn\u2019s position on both is confusing at best. He wants to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/28/corbyn-defence-of-immigration-splits-shadow-cabinet-labour\" title=\"\">maintain free migration</a> but does not want membership of the single market, only access. His commitment to free rather than controlled migration sits uneasily alongside his rejection of free capital movements and trade in favour of controls. Mr Corbyn still seems in denial about the importance of the issues and their electoral potency. Labour can only climb its electoral mountain by agreeing on the right choice of route upwards. That is more easily said than done. There is a long way still to go. Success is far from certain. But at least Labour is at base camp.</p>",

It is senseless almost to the point of superstition. Yet Corbyn\u2019s line falls like flesh among piranhas, instantly devoured as proof of his pointless idealism, his unelectability, his failure to be humble in the face of the public, which has spoken. There is no correct answer to this: if he had offered a cap, what would it be? Two hundred thousand? Most analysis suggests that EU migration probably peaked at that anyway, and it would be a limit offered in bad faith. A hundred thousand? Into tens of thousands, as Cameron famously, fatuously promised?</p> <p>The fact is that while migrants are held to represent a threat, and leeches on a scarce resource, 10,000 is too many. If any inward migration steals your job and takes your GP appointment, then it all represents a failure to prioritise the wellbeing of your citizens.</p> <p>If the Labour party accepts that as an accurate depiction \u2013 even as a starting point for promises for extra funding, the restitution of the migrant impact fund \u2013 then it has already lost.

Not everything can be solved by throwing money at it. It may come as a surprise to him that ordinary working people aspire to more than just a job, a home, the NHS and social services. They can think beyond the day-to-day struggle to survive. The Brexit vote proved that they are active participants in their own destiny, wishing to have control over their lives, their future and that of their communities, and the direction of their country.</p> <p>The \u201cfreedom\u201d of movement of labour is a misnomer. A more accurate description would be the \u201cenforced\u201d movement of labour. Does anyone think that when the young Polish lad who cleans windows in north London was asked by his teacher of his future ambition, he said cleaning windows in a foreign land some thousands of miles away from his home?</p> <p>The free movement of labour is double-edged: not only does it put pressure on wages, working conditions and social services of the countries receiving the immigrant labour, it also hollows out the countries the immigrant labour left, draining them of their major asset \u2013 the working population.<br><strong>Fawzi Ibrahim</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 At last, a politician with principles who sticks by them. And those Labour MPs who accept the nasty immigration attitudes which the rightwing press has been fomenting for a decade or more should look to their consciences \u2013 and the facts on immigration \u2013 before jumping on the immigration-bashing platform.</p> <p>Of course immigration on a large scale causes problems, but it is not the main cause of poverty in the UK or the anger of working people; that is down to a decade of wage stagnation and austerity, with no end in sight as Theresa May has already forgotten about the \u201cleft-behind\u201d. This is the biggest crisis facing Europe, with millions of refugees fleeing wars and devastation which we have helped create in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya, so is Britain going to play a part in solving the problem, or are we going to turn our back on the world?</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn is just following in Angela Merkel\u2019s footprints when, earlier this year, she told the German people: \u201cWe can manage it \u2026 Germany is a strong country.\u201d So, we should be asking: is Britain strong enough to play our role in dealing with the problem?

Having learned nothing from Brexit, Corbyn is sticking to his more-immigration guns in what looks like an electoral death wish.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear: continuing with our present immigration policies is undemocratic, as more than three-quarters of us want immigration reduced, <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/r4762fpv66/YG-Archive-Pol-Sunday-Times-results-060315.pdf\" title=\"\">while less than 5% want it increased</a>. It is also the opposite of internationalism, since it implies that we will continue to steal doctors, nurses, IT experts etc from poorer countries, rather than train enough of our own. Yet there is a way out of this. Many of us are very supportive of the rest of Corbyn\u2019s social, environmental and equality programme, but unless Labour debates how to makes controlling immigration a central plank of its manifesto, we are surely doomed to a Conservative/Ukip majority after the next election.<br><strong>Colin Hines</strong><br><em>East Twickenham, Middlesex</em></p> <p>\u2022 The \u201cschism at the heart of Corbynism\u201d is visible not only in the debate on Trident (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/corbyn-leader-progress-schism--trident\" title=\"\">Rafael Behr</a>, 28 September) but also on immigration and refugee policy. Corbynism rightly supports free movement of labour, better conditions for migrants, and a more open door for refugees. It is wrongly ambivalent about Brexit, with some parts of the camp actively supporting it. It ignores or denies the fact that Brexit was <em>in nuce</em> a vote to curb free movement, worsen conditions for migrants and close the door further for refugees. It tries to square the circle either by redefining what Brexit is (\u201ctaking back control\u201d) or by speaking as little as possible about it.</p> <p>The schism within the opposition to Corbyn is equally pronounced. It rightly supports staying in the EU, which entails free movement, but declares that we must listen to the \u201clegitimate concerns of the white working class\u201d, which is code for embracing anti-immigration at best and covert racism at worst.</p> <p>These schisms bode ill for the future coherence of the Labour party. What is needed to resolve them is not complex: a vigorous campaign to stay in the EU even at this late stage; endorsement of free movement of labour; measures to stop employers using migrants as a reserve army of cheap labour; open wider doors to refugees. This means confronting both the left\u2019s traditional flirtation with anti-European nationalism, which often hides under the mask of \u201cinternationalism\u201d and \u201canti-imperialism\u201d, and the right\u2019s endorsement of a prejudice and xenophobia that hides under the mask of \u201clistening to the voice of the common folk\u201d.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/nov/30/architecture.artsfeatures\">Mies van der Rohe</a> was born first, in 1886, in Aachen, Germany. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/11/le-corbusier-india-architecture-1965\">Le Corbusier </a>arrived the following year, and 250 miles to the south, in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. Mies went on to become the godfather of the steel-and-glass <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/International-Style-architecture\">international style</a>; Corbu, enamored with the possibilities of concrete, essentially created <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/18/raw-concrete-beauty-of-barbarism-barnabas-calder-review\">brutalism</a>. Which means that not only were the two architects great builders in their own right; they were also responsible for creating the greatest sibling rivalry in the history of architecture.</p> <p>Le Corbusier\u2019s brutalism took an early lead, not least because of concrete\u2019s cost advantage: it is cheap and abundant, the second most consumed material in the world, after water. Brutalism also had the art-historical advantage of fitting easily into a centuries-long narrative. The monumental brutalist vaulting of the Washington Metro, for instance, is uncannily similar to that found in largest concrete dome in the world \u2013 the 2,000-year-old Pantheon, in Rome.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e613bcf786b96a23c390b91d7b8f00432ceff672\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e613bcf786b96a23c390b91d7b8f00432ceff672/0_262_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mass Donna Summer roller disco tribute takes palce outside Boston City Hall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mass Donna Summer roller disco tribute takes palce outside Boston City Hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boston Globe via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet by the 1960s, when both movements really hit their stride, it was the international style that was in the ascendant. Mies had given New York City the Seagram Building, \u201cthe millennium\u2019s most important building\u201d, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/18/magazine/best-building-opposites-attract.html\">according to Herbert Muschamp</a> of the New York Times. Citizens of modern cities on every continent started looking up and seeing shimmering sheets of glass, as their formerly parochial towns were transformed into something resembling the Emerald City from The Wizard of Oz. A new international phenomenon emerged: the modern skyline, comprising buildings that aspired to float \u2013 effortlessly, impossibly \u2013 upwards, in a reverie of light and transparency. This, surely, was the golden future. The lucky few were part of it already, and everybody else wanted in. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the 99% (although they didn\u2019t call themselves that at the time) found themselves raising families in suburban concrete housing estates that were direct descendants of <a href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/85971/ad-classics-unite-d-habitation-le-corbusier\">Corbusier\u2019s Unit\u00e9 d\u2019habitation</a>, or housing unit, in Marseille. The impetus behind such buildings was just as idealistic as any Miesian tower, but concrete architecture is unforgiving, and budgets were tight, and no one ever bothered to consult the people whose lives were ostensibly being improved. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee630e93064fb19dfe0f703ee4aa49f3cd40659f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee630e93064fb19dfe0f703ee4aa49f3cd40659f/0_0_1368_2000/684.jpg\" alt=\"Pedestrians cross New York\u2019s Park Avenue in front of the landmark Seagram Building.\" width=\"684\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pedestrians cross New York\u2019s Park Avenue in front of the landmark Seagram Building.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The result was that brutalism, in the public mind, became the architecture of a forgotten underclass: windswept plazas, crumbling concrete, ugly dystopian soullessness. Far from being something to aspire to, it was something to escape from. The name didn\u2019t help: even though it derives from the French <em>b\u00e9ton brut</em>, for raw concrete, it still connotes brutality. The architecture could be pretty brutal too: hulking, massive, monumental. Certainly by 1981, when Tom Wolfe published <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/11/08/specials/wolfe-bauhaus.html\">From Bauhaus to Our House</a>, brutalism had become something to hate, a symbol of everything that was wrong with modern architecture.</p> <p>The story, however, does not end there. The international style evolved, and not well. What used to be aspirational started becoming an in-your-face statement of conspicuous consumption. The gauche gaudiness of was embraced not only where you might expect it (the Wynn towers of Las Vegas, say), but also in places with real history, such as New York City. Go to Columbus Circle today, for instance, and you\u2019ll see Christian de Portzamparc\u2019s billionaire condos at One57 face off against \u201ca 1950s international style glass skyscraper in a 1980s gold lame party dress,\u201d as Muschamp <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/21/nyregion/trump-tries-convert-50-s-style-into-90-s-gold-makeover-starts-columbus-circle.html\">described</a> the Trump International Hotel. Such erections generate almost as much hatred today as the worst mistakes of brutalism did in the 1960s, and understandably so: they represent a world in which the more obtrusive and ostentatious you are, the more profit you make.</p> <p>The international style, deservedly or not, is bearing the brunt of the global backlash against rising inequality at all levels of society. Gentrification has become a dirty word, and nothing exemplifies gentrification more than some new steel-and-glass tower going up in the middle of a tight-knit middle-income community. The openness and transparency ostensibly espoused by the architectural vernacular fool no one: these \u201cresidences\u201d are sealed off from their neighborhoods, shiny bubbles of wealth and privilege invariably protected from their less salubrious neighbors by multiple layers of security.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fec2532e19c625715e698e81a12f2e79dfec092d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fec2532e19c625715e698e81a12f2e79dfec092d/0_0_4168_3173/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An exterior view of the Met Breuer, named after Marcel Breuer, who designed it.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"761\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An exterior view of the Met Breuer, named after Marcel Breuer, who designed it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thus was the stage set for the resurgence of brutalism. You can\u2019t put a brutalist building in a gold lame party dress: raw concrete is raw concrete. It\u2019s down-to-earth, honest, unpretentious, egalitarian, and creates buildings rooted in place: <a href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/117442/ad-classics-boston-city-hall-kallmann-mckinnell-knowles\">Boston City Hall</a>, New York\u2019s Whitney Museum (now the Met Breuer), the city of Bras\u00edlia. </p> <p>Unlike steel and glass, concrete has terroir: the reddish concrete of Boston, for instance, looks and feels very different from the fine-grained concrete of Japan. You take the local rock, bind it with cement and water, and there you have your concrete. Its very nature is local rather than blandly international.</p> <p>When they\u2019re treated with care and respect, brutalist buildings can become treasured by a city in a way that glass-and-steel towers very rarely are. In London, for instance, locals and tourists alike swarm to the concrete cultural buildings on the south bank of the Thames at Waterloo Bridge. These masterpieces \u2013 the Royal Festival Hall, the Hayward Gallery, <a href=\"http://www.dezeen.com/2014/10/06/brutalist-buildings-national-theatre-london-denys-lasdun/\">Denys Lasdun\u2019s National Theatre</a> \u2013 are a beloved part of the capital, a destination even for people with no particular reason to go there.</p> <p>A similar possessiveness can be found in residential architecture. Consider Rupert Murdoch, a man who seemingly buys and sells New York homes as a hobby, never staying in one too long, and sometimes never moving in at all. In London, by contrast, he has lived in a Lasdun-designed brutalist apartment block overlooking Green Park for decades, which I very much doubt he will ever sell. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e02941a1e5d53c96e05513a92978d6dd8604f39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e02941a1e5d53c96e05513a92978d6dd8604f39/0_763_4690_2814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denys Lasdun\u2019s National Theatre, built in 1975 on London\u2019s South Bank.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denys Lasdun\u2019s National Theatre, built in 1975 on London\u2019s South Bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Great brutalist buildings, it turns out, have soul, in a way that antiseptic glass curtain walls never will. And they have undeniable power, too. Consider<a href=\"http://architecture.about.com/od/greatbuildings/ss/holocaust.htm\"> Peter Eisenman\u2019s haunting holocaust memorial</a> in Berlin: it would be unthinkable in anything but concrete. </p> <p>Brutalism is protean, as well. With concrete, anything is possible, and astonishing new ideas can emerge at any time: consider <a href=\"http://www.studiootherspaces.net/\">Olafur Eliasson\u2019s Studio Other Spaces</a>, which has developed a technique to cast huge chunks of glacial ice in concrete. When the ice melts, it leaves a series of gorgeously textured irregular spaces. The raw-concrete interiors formed using this technique are like nothing the world has ever seen.</p> <p>Most subversively, brutalism is old. If you move into a brutalist building today, there\u2019s a very good chance that it was built 50 years ago. Certainly contemporary architects such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2011/jun/19/architecture-serpentine-pavilion\">Peter Zumthor </a>continue to do wonderful work in the same vein, alongside greats like <a href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/tag/tadao-ando/\">Tadao Ando</a>. But venture to the heart of brutalism and you won\u2019t find brand names and <em>starchitects</em> and buildings of preternatural beauty. Instead you\u2019ll find thousands of much humbler structures, characterized by simplicity, functionality and what-you-see-is-what-you-get directness.</p> <p>Brutalism today has developed a unique ability to cut across class divides. Blue-collar workers and billionaires alike appreciate its charms even if they are sometimes frustrated by its inflexibility; are attracted to its plainness while being inspired by its palpable integrity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a70928c2094acf911b7279a1d16c2c6329af2817\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a70928c2094acf911b7279a1d16c2c6329af2817/0_0_2717_1129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hiddleston in High Rise: the organic and the concrete.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"416\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hiddleston in High Rise: the organic and the concrete.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: StudioCanal/Planet Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s easy to see, then, how brutalism is flourishing in the age of Occupy. But there\u2019s another force driving the brutalist resurgence, which is maybe less austere and selfless: photography, in general, and Instagram, in particular.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/17/high-rise-review-tom-hiddleston-ben-wheatley-jb-ballard\">High-Rise</a>, the 2015 Ben Wheatley adaptation of JG Ballard\u2019s novel, you will surely remember the vision of Tom Hiddleston\u2019s smooth yet chiseled naked body as seen from above, framed by a raw-concrete balcony. The intersection of the organic with concrete makes for striking visuals, and even concrete on its own has stunning visual power. Something as simple as a shadow packs a much harder punch when it falls across a beautifully textured grey background.</p> <p>Say what you like about brutalist buildings, you have to admit they look gorgeous in photographs and in coffee-table books such as <a href=\"http://www.coolhunting.com/culture/this-brutal-world-architecture-book-phaidon\">This Brutal World</a>, recently published by Phaidon. Brutalism might still be a bit austere for many people\u2019s taste. But when you live in something that good looking, you can\u2019t help but feel a little bit of glamor by association.</p>",

They compared pieces of the Buk retrieved from the crash site with various types of missile from the 9M38 series.

In just over a year, the Labour party has gone from a being desiccated husk of worn-down old leftists and elbows-out young Blairites to being a mass movement. At half a million members, it is the biggest party in Europe \u2013 at a time when other political parties are dying. To use business terminology, we have witnessed something akin to a reverse takeover of the Labour party. It is incomplete and it is certainly contested, but it is real.</p> <p>And what the head of this new movement \u2013 confirmed as its leader twice in 12 months \u2013 was sketching out today was the potential for a social movement in electoral politics.

But without an open dialogue there is a risk that some of their policies could take us backwards. </p> <p>With such significant economic challenges ahead, the UK needs a strong opposition firing on all cylinders and providing progressive, practical new ideas.</p> <p>The focus on research and development, infrastructure and education is encouraging, but artificially hiking wages and changing corporation tax could be investment dampeners, not drivers. </p> <p>Labour is certainly laying out a new way forward and we urge them to iron out inconsistent messages - especially the relationship between state and industry - and clarify policies that are sometimes hard to see delivered and paid for.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Simon Walker</strong>, the Institute of Directors\u2019 director general</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A credible opposition is crucial in keeping the Government on its toes. We will need an effective Labour party challenging the Conservatives during Brexit negotiations to get a deal in the best interests of the country. While Jeremy Corbyn did touch upon important areas for future economic success, like skills and infrastructure, he is not yet putting forward a plan which looks like a platform for government. The basic question is, how will he pay for these mammoth spending plans?</p> <p>The problem for business is that it simply does not see the world in the same way as the Labour leader. The IoD does not think companies are beyond reproach, we have been publically critical of Mike Ashley and Philip Green, but in this speech business was presented as a comic-book villain. Over 80% of people work in the private sector and there are more than five million businesses in the UK. They are the source of the nation\u2019s prosperity, the generators of employment and the funders of our public services. They are not a problem to be solved.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Terry Scuoler, chief executive of <strong>EEF,</strong> the manufacturers\u2019 organisation</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whilst it is welcome to hear the leader of the Opposition talking about the importance of industrial strategy and, the importance of manufacturing, his credentials are far from established in terms of demonstrating an understanding of the overwhelming benefits of liberal capitalism and the society he claims to support.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebf0c4e4b049b74e4cb048\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T16:35:59.247Z\">5.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Corbyn's speech in numbers</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Press Association has filed some statistics about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There were a total of five mentions of either \u201csocialism\u201d or \u201csocialist\u201d.

He has smartened up (literally), his media performances have been noticeably better this week than they were at last year\u2019s conference and that speech was probably the best he\u2019s ever given on a national platform like this.</p> <p>Corbyn will never be a racy orator, but he did not try for that here and there was nothing that sounded dud or phoney. There was relatively little of the ritual opponent-bashing you get in these speeches (a blessing), no jokes that misfired (in fact, only one joke \u2013 but a good one), and instead just a serious policy manifesto. It did go on a bit, but dull and earnest is not necessarily bad, particularly if as a politician you have yet to establish your credentials as credible future prime minister.</p> <p>Corbyn did not indulge in any recriminations. Perhaps he could have made more of an effort to reach out beyond his natural constituency, but his speech focused on topics like housing, transport and education that do matter to people who read the Daily Mail. It is often said that Corbyn is a politician who gets most animated talking about human rights and world peace. But in this speech he restrained himself, and the Iraq/Saudia Arabia references were rather brief. It was noticeable that the loudest cheers came when he mentioned the Chilcot report. The Corbynites in the audience may have preferred 50 minutes of Blair-bashing, and 10 minutes of domestic policy. But Corbyn wisely did not give them what they wanted.</p> <p>Blair fought the 1997 general election with a five-point pledge card that eventually became very well known. At the moment Corbyn\u2019s 10 pledges have made zero dent on the public consciousness. But today he put them firmly on the table. Some seem little more than vague aspirations (a national education service), though not necessarily bad ones. Some are surprisingly similar to what the government is doing (like getting business to pay for training \u2013 or the apprenticeship levy, as George Osborne called it.)</p> <p>But his headline announcement, about giving councils new powers to borrow to build homes, seems a good one. Why? Because proposals like this have in the past had the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25205623\">backing of credible organisations like the Local Government Association</a>. And even <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/08/why-wont-osborne-let-councils-borrow-build-housing-even-tories-want-him\">Boris Johnson came out in favour of a proposal like this</a> when he was London mayor.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T15:22:05.288Z\">at 4.22pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ebd69fe4b049b74e4cafa4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T14:42:26.012Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn is on his peroration.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Everyone here \u2026 and every one of our hundreds of thousands of members \u2026. has something to contribute to our cause.

Given the fact that he is expected to leave parliament and become mayor of Greater Manchester next year (it would take a spectacular upset Labour to lose that contest), this was almost certainly Burnham\u2019s last speech to the conference as a frontbencher. He seemed quite emotional at the end, and he received a warm standing ovation.</p> <p>Here are the main points from the speech.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Burnham said that he was leaving the shadow cabinet.</strong> A reshuffle is due next week, and Burnham will probably be replaced then. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is my tenth conference speaking to you as a cabinet or shadow cabinet minister.</p> <p>And it will be my last.</p> <p>It is time for me to turn my full focus to Greater Manchester. </p> <p>That\u2019s why I can tell you all first today that I have asked Jeremy to plan a new shadow cabinet without me, although I will of course stay until it is in place.<br></p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour had failed so far to respond to people\u2019s concerns about immigration.</strong> It had to show that it understood why people voted for Brexit, he said. Jeremy Corbyn is proposing various measures, including bringing back the migration impact fund, to deal with immigration concerns and Burnham did not directly contradict anything Corbyn has said. But his tone suggested that his stance on the subject is quite different from his leader\u2019s. Burnham said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conference, this party must fully face up to this fact: millions of lifelong Labour supporters voted to leave the EU and - let\u2019s be honest - voted for change on immigration.</p> <p>We haven\u2019t yet even begun to show to them that we understand why.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to hear this party make the patronising argument that people didn\u2019t understand their referendum vote. They understood it very well.</p> <p>The truth is the EU was working better for some parts of our country than it was for others.</p> <p>For some of our country\u2019s least affluent areas, it wasn\u2019t working well at all ...</p> <p>Labour voters in constituencies like mine are not narrow-minded, nor xenophobic, as some would say. </p> <p>They are warm and giving. Their parents and grandparents welcomed thousands of Ukrainians and Poles to Leigh after the Second World War.</p> <p>And today they continue to welcome refugees from all over the world. They have no problem with people coming here to work.</p> <p>But they do have a problem with people taking them for granted and with unlimited, unfunded, unskilled migration which damages their own living standards. </p> <p>And they have an even bigger problem with an out-of-touch elite who don\u2019t seem to care about it.</p> <p>If Labour now argues for the status quo, it will look like we have abandoned them too.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he favoured a \u201cfair\u201d Brexit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So let\u2019s develop a plan for fair Brexit that deals with their concerns but supports our economy and keeps the Britain we have known - open, welcoming, playing its part in the world.</p> <p>Because the truth is, a hard Brexit would hit these Labour areas hardest of all.</p> </blockquote> <p>(Ironically Michael Howard, the former Conservative leader, also used the phrase \u201cfair\u201d Brexit on the Today programme this morning when asked what sort of Brexi he wanted.)</p> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn criticised those in the party who have been attacking the record of the Blair/Brown governments.</strong> He said he was \u201csad to hear the achievements of our Labour government, in which I was proud to serve, being dismissed as if they were nothing.\u201d</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He appealed for unity.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have given my all to this party and always put its interests above those of factions and personalities.</p> <p>And I have given exactly the same loyalty to all four of the Labour leaders I have served.</p> <p>Some say that makes me inconsistent.</p> <p>But, you know what conference? I have an old-fashioned belief - that a Labour government of any kind is a million times better for my constituents in Leigh than any Tory government and that is more likely to happen if Labour is united.</p> <p>So let us unite - let\u2019s have an end to divisive talk about deselections but, in return, let\u2019s have more respect for the democratic will of you, our members.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He called for a full inquiry into Orgreave.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Doesn\u2019t it make you angry, conference, that, thirty years on, former miners are still struggling for the truth? Ordinary people who were fighting for their jobs, their communities, their future.</p> <p>Whose own country tried to put them on trial. It\u2019s why, even today, Britain still feels like two countries. Norman Tebbitt, remember him, well he says an inquiry would be a waste of money. Well, he would say that, wouldn\u2019t he? Let me tell him why it\u2019s not. </p> <p>Kevin Thorne, a former miner at Orgeave, came to Westminster recently to lobby the Home Secretary for an inquiry. He was asked why, after all these years, he is still campaigning. He said this: \u201cI want my grandchildren to be able to trust the Police as I was brought up to do.\u201d</p> <p>That is why Orgreave matters, Conference. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he would continue to campaign for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/12/andy-burnham-hillsborough-law-policing-and-crime-bill\"> a \u201cHillsborough law\u201d,</a> giving bereaved families being represented at inquests the same legal support as the police. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the rest of my time in parliament, I will fight for the proposed Hillsborough Law.</p> <p>A law to rebalance the justice system, away from the Establishment and decisively in favour of ordinary people. And I ask you to get fully behind that campaign.</p> <p>A Law that says no public bodies can distort or withhold the truth at inquests; that guarantees all bereaved families a level playing field and equal legal funding - and that Home Secretary should include those Birmingham families.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He accused Theresa May of \u201cpositioning herself to the right of the leave campaign\u201d.</strong> He justified that on the grounds that May has refused to guarantee that EU nationals living in the UK will be able to stay after Brexit. Even Vote Leave said they should stay, he said.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour should champion devolution and the northern powerhouse.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let\u2019s seize this moment, put our stamp on devolution and make it a Labour campaign: for a more equal England. Conference, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for the support you have given to me over the last ten years.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9eef840b268d15ab3c85c5ae96f3418113874e67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9eef840b268d15ab3c85c5ae96f3418113874e67/0_122_3649_2190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Burnham addressing the Labour conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Burnham addressing the Labour conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T12:04:20.177Z\">at 1.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57eba45fe4b01b56deffc325\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T11:13:09.600Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In here speech during the home affairs debate <strong>Yvette Cooper</strong>, chair of Labour\u2019s refugee taskforce, said that France and Britain should agree to each take half of the 1,000 unaccompanied child refugees in Calais.

Here are 10 things we\u2019ve learnt.</p> <p><strong>1 \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s re-election has strengthened his position in the party \u2013 but it hasn\u2019t decisively altered the balance of power.</strong> Normally the moment after an election victory is when a leader is constrained the least. But for Corbyn there is no one left to sack, any frontbench promotions will be determined by who offers to serve, not who Corbyn picks, and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-expected-to-lose-majority-support-of-labour-nec\">as the struggle over the national executive rule changes showed,</a> Corbyn cannot depend on getting Labour\u2019s key decision-making body to do what he wants. Significantly, within two days of his re-election, Corbyn effectively conceded that,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/26/jeremy-corbyn-puts-aside-objections-to-renewing-trident\"> for now, at least, he is giving up trying to change party policy on Trident. </a>This is a significant retreat on an issue on which Corbyn has campaigned all his life.<br></p> <p><strong>2 \u2013 Labour now feels like two parties that don\u2019t even like each other anymore but that cannot afford to get divorced. </strong>There has been no serious talk at all about a split, because the mechanics of the electoral system make that suicidal and both sides are emotionally attached to the Labour brand, but there is a vast gulf between the two camps, pro-Corbyn and anti-Corbyn. Superficially the divide is about policy, but much more it is about whether people are prepared to make an emotional investment in Corbyn\u2019s purist, poll-defying idealism. Labour has become a coalition and, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@OwenJones84/a-strategy-for-jeremy-corbyns-leadership-to-succeed-9ffe4c27149b#.1hw5xd6ia\">as Owen Jones suggested in a recent essay</a>, one way forward might be a proper coalition agreement. And perhaps a quad, with Corbyn, John McDonnell, Tom Watson and Hilary Benn? They could ask David Cameron and Nick Clegg for some advice.</p> <p><strong>3 \u2013 Corbyn has made little progress over the last year in fleshing out a policy platform.</strong> The Labour MP Kerry McCarthy, who resigned from the shadow cabinet, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/21/kerry-mccarthy-im-angry-some-people-dont-care-about-being-in-power-bristol-labour-corbyn\">told the Guardian recently</a> that she had never seen Corbyn \u201cmove beyond things you could fit on a T-shirt\u201d in his policy thinking and this conference seems to bear that out. A year ago, after his surprise election as leader, Corbyn could be forgiven for only having an outline view as to what he would do. This year he has barely moved on and conference has been relatively policy-lite. McDonnell did give a speech with a speech with a clear set of economic proposals but almost none of them have been worked up in any detail and his headline announcement (a \u00a310 minimum wage) was something he promised last year. Corbyn is also proposing a \u00a3500bn investment plan but the party has released no detail about this and at the moment the plan seems to amount to nothing more than a figure on a press release. On economic policy, and even more so in other areas like education and welfare, there is little evidence that the party has started taking difficult choices, or started engaging seriously with outside bodies on legislative proposals.<br></p> <p><strong>4 \u2013 Corbyn\u2019s critics are not united. </strong>At the time of the \u201ccoup\u201d shadow ministers announced their resignations on an hour by hour basis in a move that was clearly coordinated. But since Corbyn\u2019s re-election on Saturday there has been no agreed, group response from the MPs who left the front bench in the hope of forcing him out. A few have said publicly that they would be willing to go back, a few more may have been speaking to Corbyn privately, and Corbyn seems confident to have enough names to be able to announce a reshuffle next week. Another group may be willing to go back, but want to delay so that they can use the offer of going back as a bargaining tool to try to Corbyn to accept some form of shadow cabinet elections. A third group seem determined to remain on the back benches for good.</p> <p><strong>5 \u2013 Corbyn is probably safe at least until 2018.</strong> There is now a general recognition on the part of Corbyn\u2019s critics that this summer\u2019s leadership challenge achieved nothing and speculation about another leadership contest next year seems to have vanished. At the very least Corbyn should be safe until 2018, although there is also a widespread view that he will be able to remain leader until the general election if he wants to. After the EU referendum the prospect of an early election was used by MPs as an argument for challenging Corbyn immediately. But, now that he has won, it is Corbyn who is exploiting the \u201cearly election\u201d threat and he is citing it as a reason why MPs should back him.</p> <p><strong>6 \u2013 Labour is split over how to interpret the Brexit vote. </strong>Many MPs believe that immigration was a key factor and increasingly there are calls for the party to abandon its commitment to the free movement of labour. But Corbyn sees the Brexit vote as primarily a vote against the economic status quo and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/28/corbyn-defence-of-immigration-splits-shadow-cabinet-labour\">as he confirmed this morning, </a>he is opposed to immigration controls. Interestingly, this is one issue where Labour\u2019s old right, which is sceptical about immigration, disagrees with the pro-free movement Blairite right. On this topic Corbyn is a Blairite.</p> <p><strong>7 - Labour\u2019s leaders outside Westminster are more important to the party than ever.</strong> Devolution and the creation of elected mayors have created a new powerbase within British politics and Corbyn\u2019s opponents see it as offering the party a lifeline. Sadiq Khan openly paraded his credentials as an alternative leader this week. Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister, is being encouraged to develop a UK profile so that he can show English voters what a pragmatic Labour government can achieve. Mayoral elections next May should see other Labour figures taking executive office and in his speech yesterday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/27/labour-conference-jeremy-corbyn-tom-watson-says-party-must-prepare-for-fourth-industrial-revolution?page=with:block-57ea9feae4b08ca277ca0c82#block-57ea9feae4b08ca277ca0c82\">Tom Watson said these figures, and Labour councillors, would be the ones who led Labour back to power.</a> Not Corbyn, he implied.</p> <p><strong>8 - In person Labour members are much more civil to each other than anyone would guess from reading the papers.</strong> In the run-up to conference some people were predicting 1980s-style fights and blood on the floor, and <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/labour-mp-ruth-smeeth-to-take-24hour-minder-to-party-conference-after-flood-of-threats-a3350021.html\">one MP even said she was coming to the conference with a minder. </a>In practice it has been very peaceful. The level of heckling is not much worse than at an average conference, there have barely been any raised voices and the only punch thrown occurred when Clive Lewis (reportedly) hit a wall because he was angry with Corbyn\u2019s office interfering with his speech. That is not to say that the social media abuse has not been real. But Twitter is a real world, not <em>the</em> real world, and in realspace, if not cyberspace, Labour members seem to get on.</p> <p><strong>9 - Momentum is not Militant, and they can run a lively, successful conference. </strong>One of the highlights of Liverpool has been Momentum\u2019s The World Transformed alternative conference (or festival, as they prefer to call it) taking place about half a mile away. Anyone turning up expecting a Militant re-enactment will have been disappointed. Outside there were older, hard-core lefties selling \u201cdeselect your MP\u201d literature. But as journalists like Andrew Grice <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/jeremy-corbyn-labour-conference-momentum-world-transformed-critics-will-not-like-it-a7331036.html\">(here)</a> and Paul Mason<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/sep/26/the-real-lesson-from-corbyns-victory-you-cant-hold-back-history\"> (here) </a>report, inside it was full of young, earnest, welcoming activists seemingly with no interest in becoming the next Derek Hatton. In the long run it is till not clear what impact Momentum will have on Labour, but this week its reputation has gone up.</p> <p><strong>10 - Corbyn has no obvious successor.</strong> Most parties normally have an unofficial leader-in-waiting. Often they never get the job (Yvette Cooper filled this role for Labour for much of the last parliament), but nevertheless the ULIW carries some clout. At Liverpool the position is vacant. Clive Lewis\u2019s standing as a potential, Corbyn-lite alternative leader is on the rise (for reasons Stephen Bush explains <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/09/what-will-labours-new-awkward-squad-do-next\">here),</a> and some Corbyn-sceptics, like Chuka Umunna and Lisa Nandy, have been prominent on the fringe.

It hasn\u2019t received much attention, but potentially it is significant. </p> <p>Delegates were voting on a package of changes to Labour party, the most important of which was one to give Scotland and Wales a seat each on the NEC. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-expected-to-lose-majority-support-of-labour-nec\">As Jessica Elgot reports,</a> that resulted in Jeremy Corbyn losing his majority on the NEC. Labour has published the exact voting figures this morning and the motion was carried by 80% to 20%. Only 8% of union votes were against, but 32% of constituency Labour party (CLP) delegates were.</p> <p>But the conference also voted on various alternative changes proposed by CLPs. Most were relatively uncontentious, but in one case the conference voted for the change despite the NEC being opposed to it. This was a proposal to stop conference delegates having to vote to approve policy documents on a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis. Instead in future they will be able to reject specific bits of a policy document.</p> <p>As Paul Waugh explains<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/labour-nec-gerrymandering-jeremy-corbyn-tom-watson-kezia-dugdale_uk_57ea5674e4b0397f73b79ccb?2r8vrgtdj3f7833di\"> at Huffington Post</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The centrists suffered a significant defeat minutes later, when conference backed a long-held plan of the party\u2019s left to unpick policy documents.</p> <p>The Sheffield Heeley CLP amendment, which was carried, states that \u201cConference has the right to refer back any part of a document without rejecting the policy document as a whole...\u201d</p> <p>Party insiders said the change - passed after a narrow vote - will now guarantee that future party conferences will be dominated by rows as each individual policy can be voted on separately rather than as part of a package.</p> </blockquote> <p>The vote was very close: 51.5% in favour, 48.5% against.

The first of these was caused by not spotting that \u2018Man!\u2019 can mean \u2018How surprising!\u2019 in the clue to ZAMAN, with ZAMIA also being a tree. (But I would never use \u2018surprising\u2019 to indicate an anagram, surely stretching its meaning too far.) The other error was CIDER for CYDER, despite my hint in the clue as the spelling required: \u2018One heading left or right, we hear, for strong drink (beware second!)\u2019. Failure to see how the clue to GOOLY worked (go (to p)oly) added to the confusion, no doubt. Favourite clue, of 21 nominated at least once, was \u2018Take ill?

This can of course happen from to time, but I\u2019m not averse to giving you an easy start, even when, as many of you commented, the puzzle as a whole is seen as easier than average (though there are always some taking the opposite view!). It was perhaps inevitable that David Jason and Only Fools and Horses should prove popular. His catchphrase as used in Mr Smailes\u2019s VHC is on the borderline of acceptability as a definition, but I found it too funny to resist. A few of you resorted to \u2018Lemon\u2019 as a definition, with reference to the enticingly named Meadowlark Lemon, a star player, I learn, in the Harlem Globetrotters. I judged this as on the wrong side of familiarity to earn high marks, my guess being that it would fail to pass as acceptable by crossword editors in other papers. I have to make such judgements unaided, being subjected to no such scrutiny by the Observer, so it interests me to read recent correspondence in the Guardian about the perceived increase in difficulty of its crosswords of late. I suspect this results from the desire among regular setters to push back the boundaries of \u2018crypticity\u2019 rather than from any deliberate intention to make life more difficult for solvers. My own aim is always to maintain a consistent standard of difficulty, but innovative approaches will inevitably occur from time to time. Your reactions usually tell me when I\u2019ve gone too far!</p>",
  "<p>Bouchra Jarrar\u2019s first show for Lanvin at Paris fashion week kicked off at noon on Wednesday, under bright lights at the H\u00f4tel de Ville. This represents a shift for the French fashion house. Under the direction of Alber Elbaz for 14 years, Lanvin was always an evening show often soundtracked with disco. The time and place announced a new mood and the clothes in the collection were like night and day, too. <br></p> <p>The first look was an ivory jacket worn over a satin shirt dress. This was followed by a chiffon kilt, pyjama suiting in pinstripes, floaty floral gowns and embellished vests. Most looks came with jewelled flowers pinned somewhere, and embellishment was everywhere. <br></p> <p>These were clothes that fit into women\u2019s lives \u2013 or the lifestyles of women who can afford luxury fashion, anyway. Nothing was even slightly avant garde: classic glamour was the general theme. A lot of the designs looked ready for the corporate balls of its wealthy customers, a white satin ruched gown, an asymmetric ivory dress with black sash, a black satin dress cut to skim the body, sandals with diamant\u00e9 chain-mail cuff. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26f8f0161396ce137452ed44a5e564dcfdcfc71f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26f8f0161396ce137452ed44a5e564dcfdcfc71f/0_4_2503_3905/641.jpg\" alt=\"Jourdan Dunn at the Lanvin runway show.\" width=\"641\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British model Jourdan Dunn saunters down the runway body-skimming chiffon and silk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giannoni/WWD/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some pieces had an off-duty feel, such as a loose embellished top with oversized cardigan and flat sandals, a biker jacket or tailored trousers. Critics might grumble about the lack of Elbaz-like runway razzle-dazzle, but real life has reached Lanvin in the hands of Jarrar.</p> <p>Jarrar, dressed in a chic satin shirt and black trousers, answered questions backstage through a translator. While hugging her son, she said she found the legacy of Jeanne Lanvin \u2013 who founded the house in 1889, originally designing clothes for her daughter Marguerite \u2013 very inspiring. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt was effortless to find the connection,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to mix the intellectual with the creative.\u201d And the romantic, Jarrar was asked? \u201c<em>Tous jours</em>,\u201d came the reply. Jarrar was named artistic director of the house in March. \u201cHer timeless style is in keeping with the style and the values of our company,\u201d said chief executive Mich\u00e8le Huiban. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e1bd1834801e4fe0e01a491cc141b13ad2e7c9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e1bd1834801e4fe0e01a491cc141b13ad2e7c9f/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Lanvin 2017 spring/summer ready-to-wear show on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Lanvin 2017 spring/summer ready-to-wear show on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Kovarik/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 45-year-old designer worked as the studio director under Nicolas Ghesquiere at Balenciaga and in the couture department of Christian Lacroix.

His louche designs and comedic personality \u2013 complete with signature bow tie and spectacles \u2013 stood for Lanvin during his reign. He was much liked in fashion and at his HQ, with the Lanvin team protesting his departure. He has since described his exit as \u201chis tragedy\u201d. It is widely believed that Elbaz was pushed out of Lanvin by the house\u2019s financiers, led by majority shareholder Shaw-Lan Wang who bought Lanvin in 2001, and originally recruited Elbaz. <br></p> <p>Profits have certainly declined in recent years, from \u00a310.25m in 2012 to \u00a32.5m in 2014. In that context, Jarrar\u2019s collection makes a lot of sense. </p> <p>If Lanvin was about commerce, other shows on Wednesday were at the more artistic end of fashion. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6bad9402517b2a105bf7164ab299645d51f08e13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bad9402517b2a105bf7164ab299645d51f08e13/0_112_4647_2788/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor Charlene Choi, owner of Lanvin Shaw Lan Wang, and guests.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Actor Charlene Choi, owner of Lanvin Shaw Lan Wang, and guests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maison Margiela, under the direction of John Galliano, was a mash-up of sportswear and classic French staples.

It was an eclectic mix or, as the show notes said, a collection with \u201cintrinsic strangeness\u201d.</p> <p>Dries Van Noten\u2019s show is always a favourite of the arty-inclined fashion crowd. Huge photogenic bouquets of flowers frozen in ice, made by artist Makoto Azuma, dotted the catwalk. The show delivered clothes that would fit in at the crowds at London\u2019s Frieze art fair. There were jet-beaded dresses and coats, chrysanthemum prints and wide coats with graphic prints akin to a De Kooning painting. A finale to an a capella of Madonna\u2019s song Frozen was a fitting oddity that ensured Van Noten\u2019s place in the art camp.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d596b15e9a71c808f0868a3722fa3148703504d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d596b15e9a71c808f0868a3722fa3148703504d/0_122_3456_4320/800.jpg\" alt=\"Bouchra Jarrar with model Liya Kebede after the Lanvin show.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bouchra Jarrar with model Liya Kebede after the Lanvin show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

That\u2019s why an ebullient, confident Jeremy Corbyn was able to calibrate before conference the precise nature of the relationship he will have with those who cackhandedly sought to depose him.</p> <p>We will do as you wish, he told them right at the outset. We will, under my leadership, actually identify the goal of winning an election. Most of all, he said, the party was about \u201cwinning power in local and national government to deliver the real change our country so desperately needs\u201d.</p> <p>But if Corbyn confirmed for them a pleasing destination, he also made it clear that they would be undertaking the journey on his route. If their brand of unity depended on Corbyn listening to them and adapting his line on immigration or defence to assuage their fears, that, it became clear, wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p> <p>Still, there was much they could sign up to. They might balk at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/29/labour-promises-to-renationalise-english-railways\">renationalisation of the railways</a> and the politically difficult repeal of the Trade Union Act, but he threw in crowd-pleasers for right and left: a national education service, a national investment bank, more housing, curbs on tax avoidance and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/25/jeremy-corbyn-arts-pupil-premium-primary-schools-reverse-spending-cuts\">school pupil arts premium</a>.</p> <p>This was a Corbyn a world away from the hesitancy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2015/sep/12/jeremy-corbyns-victory-speech-as-labour-leader-video\">his speech last year</a>. He joshed with the audience. He connected with the campaigners of Hillsborough. He deployed a talent for comedic pauses and shrugs.</p> <p>There was Tory-bashing, during which his smooth tone ascended to a growl. There was personal testimony, about his parents and his time spent in Jamaica. Here was a man who doesn\u2019t do normal politics \u2013 but this looked very much like it.</p> <p>But above all there was a message: a repeated rebuttal of the claim that Corbynism, by definition or perhaps design, equals electoral oblivion. I can win; I want to win; I see the need to win, he said.

So, in that spirit, the proper focus for any analysis of Corbyn\u2019s speech to the Labour party conference should be on the detail of what he said rather than the way he said it.</p> <p>Which is a pity, because it was in the previously vexed matter of presentation that the leader did rather well. This was easily the most confident Corbyn performance to date, his delivery fluent and strong. Only occasionally did the emphasis stray on to the wrong syllable. Most of the time he looked relaxed in front of the Autocue rather than terrified, as he had this time last year. There was an (admittedly brief) personal passage about his upbringing, a couple of stirring quotations, even something close to a joke. All those appearances before adoring crowds over the summer have clearly helped.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-conference-jeremy-corbyns-today-interview\">Jeremy Corbyn speech: 'rampant inequality has become the great scandal of our time' - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as a good Bennite, Corbyn will obviously be uninterested in such trivia. So on to the substance. The speech was aimed chiefly at the Labour tribe, hoping to unite those who have been fighting each other so bitterly.</p> <p>He did that by reminding dissidents of the size of his renewed mandate, of the fact that Labour is now the biggest party in western Europe and by urging them to be a ready for a general election that could come at any moment. (He also warned the bigger beasts that their temporary replacements in the shadow cabinet may not be so temporary after all \u2013 that they could be the future.)</p> <p>He also sought to remind those in the hall of what they had in common, hitting those ideological notes that are more or less uncontroversial. So he played the reliable keys of opposition to grammar schools; rail nationalisation; giving councils the power to borrow to build homes; and investment in manufacturing, engineering and innovation. There were some new policy nuggets that he knew would go down well too, such as an arts pupil premium for lessons in music, dance or painting.</p> <p>What was missing was the presentation of a case to the wider Labour electorate, let alone to those people who voted Tory in 2015 and who will have to be won over if Labour is ever to return to power again.</p> <p>Corbyn barely addressed himself to the Labour voters who voted leave in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">the referendum</a>, except for telling them that they are wrong to be so opposed to immigration, and the source of their woes lies elsewhere. That\u2019s a legitimate case to make \u2013 of course it is. But it takes more than a few paragraphs \u2013 and it meant his later insistence that \u201cwe must hear [the] concerns\u201don immigration of those left-behind voters rang hollow.</p> <p>So Corbyn\u2019s team can congratulate themselves on a good afternoon. But the task confronting them is so much larger.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ellie-mae-o-hagan\">Ellie Mae O\u2019Hagan</a>: Corbyn is the only game in town</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0f6d629a0654e7f2740b9cd8bd037510b161dd10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f6d629a0654e7f2740b9cd8bd037510b161dd10/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Ellie Mae O'Hagan\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The speech confirmed two things about Jeremy Corbyn. The first is that he is not a great orator. He stumbled a few times on the Autocue and looked awkward at times. Presentation really needs to be improved if he is to reach out to the wider electorate. The second is that, right now, he is the only game in town.</p> <p>One of the things the Brexit vote revealed is that for millions of people in this country the status quo has become intolerable. Corbyn represents the only strand of the Labour party that can respond to that sentiment; it\u2019s the only one radical enough.</p> <p>And respond Corbyn did. He said the system was broken. He channelled people\u2019s anger. He promised an ambitious new settlement for the 21st century.</p> <p>The policies he listed were genuinely exciting: from renationalising the railways to a humanitarian foreign policy and repealing the Trade Union Act. Here was a leader on the side of the little guy, a leader who at least understands the challenges of the era.</p> <p>Of course, one of the biggest tasks for Corbyn in the coming months is to convince a jaded and angry electorate that he will make good on his stated ambition. The public is suspicious of politicians after decades of broken promises, and pessimistic about the possibility of politics to change the world after having their expectations lowered by the Cameron government\u2019s austerity rhetoric. And yes, Labour infighting and bad media management means the public will have questions about Corbyn\u2019s competence too.</p> <p>But Corbyn and his team should rise to these challenges with gusto. We haven\u2019t heard a mainstream politician talk like this for years. I even dared to feel a little optimistic.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/adityachakrabortty\">Aditya Chakrabortty</a>: A real reverse takeover of the Labour party</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4f8aa61bbda80428dfac983237d85f038d838c29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f8aa61bbda80428dfac983237d85f038d838c29/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Aditya Chakrabortty.\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>More fluent than last year, but miles off actual oratory; snappier lines, but hardly an epigrammatist \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn is never going to conform to the lobby\u2019s platonic ideal of what a politician should be. No memorised speeches or walkabouts on stage here. I always suspected that Ed Miliband psyched himself up for a big speech by watching box sets of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-west-wing\">The West Wing</a>. I\u2019d be surprised if Corbyn has even heard of Jed Bartlet.</p> <p>But at the heart of today\u2019s speech Corbyn was making a big new argument, one I haven\u2019t heard from a Labour leader\u2019s speech in my entire working life. In just over a year, the Labour party has gone from a being desiccated husk of worn-down old leftists and elbows-out young Blairites to being a mass movement. At half a million members, it is the biggest party in Europe \u2013 at a time when other political parties are dying. To use business terminology, we have witnessed something akin to a reverse takeover of the Labour party. It is incomplete and it is certainly contested, but it is real.</p> <p>And what the head of this new movement \u2013 confirmed as its leader twice in 12 months \u2013 was sketching out today was the potential for a social movement in electoral politics. By invoking the victories of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/sadiq-khans-first-100-days-as-london-mayor-how-is-he-doing\">Sadiq Khan in London</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/12/marvin-rees-the-bristolian-bearing-the-weight-of-labour-hopes\">Marvin Rees in Bristol</a>, he was showing that a social movement can yield victory at the ballot box.</p> <p>This will be the central argument within Labour until the next general election. The press and politicians have spent the past year asking whether this hitherto obscure backbencher can actually lead a party. Well, they\u2019ve got their answer now, even if it\u2019s not the one they\u2019d have liked. The question is: how far can a social movement go? It\u2019s what I kept hearing this week at the Momentum gathering in Liverpool, and sooner or later the keepers of the old orthodoxy will have to start grappling with it.</p> <p>One last point: in 2016, Corbyn is one of a handful of prominent politicians willing to defend migrants. That in itself is a commendation for the man \u2013 but it\u2019s also an indictment of the rest. When bright people within Labour are making their own <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_of_Blood_speech\">Rivers of Blood</a>-style speeches, I really do despair.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pollytoynbee\">Polly Toynbee</a>: The best of Corbyn \u2013 and the worst</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"49c81487719f1a154ff1839d31f80edcf8543665\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/07/13/Polly-Toynbee,-L.png\" alt=\"Polly Toynbee\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Well-delivered, it was the best of Corbyn; and it was the worst of Corbyn. His followers will see the best, in the unbending principles of an unworldly leader refusing to stoop for mere electoral advantage \u2013 and never more honourably than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-conference-jeremy-corbyns-today-interview\">over immigration</a>.</p> <p>Even if it tops voter concerns, here was no truck with populist, anti-foreigner sentiment, despite the foghorn Brexit vote: no immigration controls, no arbitrary limit on numbers. \u201cIt isn\u2019t migrants that drive down wages. It\u2019s exploitative employers.\u201d Quite right.</p> <p>But he takes his party with him on a jaw-dropping kamikaze mission, in the current climate. Where his wiser MPs talk of reasonable controls without courting Ukippery, Corbyn goes for martyrdom. A lifetime spent in Islington\u2019s liberal multicultural haven, he sees less than they of the wrath, the sense of loss, the patriotic identity crisis of Labour voters who feel their culture and good nature is imposed on. He is right: in places most afraid of immigration, numbers are mainly lowest \u2013 and voters wrongly blame migrants for all the effects of austerity cuts to schools, NHS and housing. But being right won\u2019t stop his party being blown down by a hurricane of contrary public opinion.</p> <p>That\u2019s just the tailwind of Britain\u2019s great national crisis. Where was Corbyn\u2019s plan \u2013 even a vague outline \u2013 of how Britain should negotiate Brexit? As the government splits into fragments over this, Labour needs a forensic and united strategy for holding Theresa May to account for delivering the best possible terms. But with nothing from the leadership, his MPs are all over the place too on Brexit and immigration.</p> <p>Now for the worst of Corbynism: he calls for party unity \u2013 and there was plenty here for all to rally round on housing, schools, investment and much more. But demanding no \u201ctrench warfare\u201d from his opponents, he offered not one word of protection to MPs beleaguered by his shock troops in their constituencies. The man of peace should have called off the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/jeremy-corbyn-most-labour-mps-should-not-fear-deselection\">dogs of deselection</a>.</p>",
  "<p>A care home that allowed a 91-year-old woman to die of severe hypothermia has been fined \u00a31.6m.</p> <p>Annie Barritt, a resident at Oaklands Country rest home near York, froze to death, with her temperature so cold it would not have registered on a standard thermometer, a court was told.</p> <p>She was found to be 25.3C (77.5F), nearly 10 degrees below the hypothermia threshold of 35C. York crown court heard the resident had not been given any hot food or drink as she spent her last day asleep in her room.</p> <p>The hospital discharge papers for Barritt, who had dementia, stated that she needed to be kept warm at her care home facility.

Those trusted with her care should have been aware of this cautionary note from the hospital. They were not.</p> <p>\u201cThe failure to revise Mrs Barritt\u2019s care plan was indicative to other residents. This was not an isolated occurrence.\u201d</p> <p>Maria Mallaband Care Ltd of Leeds pleaded guilty to a health-and-safety charge relating to Barritt\u2019s death at a hearing in June. At the time, the company ran 30 homes for the elderly across the country, including Oaklands, and cared for 2,600 residents.</p> <p>Batty said: \u201cIt can be seen that this case does not involve an isolated and tragic act. The death of this much loved lady, I regret to say in the context of this case, was an accident waiting to happen.</p> <p>\u201cIt my judgment it is very serious and there were systematic, systemic failures in that care home.\u201d </p> <p>Barritt was admitted to the home in July 2012 by her \u201cloving and attentive family\u201d because they thought it was the safest place for her. She had suffered from dementia for five years and was unable to make decisions for herself. She died at the home on 4 November 2012.</p> <p>The court heard previously that investigations into her death revealed the radiators in her room and other rooms nearby were never maintained. </p> <p>Staff and relatives of residents had also warned management repeatedly for two years that the oil-fired heating in the home did not work properly \u2013 but nothing had been done to rectify the situation.<br></p> <p>The home had also run out of fuel on several occasions during the two winters before her death, the court heard previously. </p> <p>Speaking at court on Tuesday, David Hercock, prosecuting on behalf of Harrogate district council, said: \u201cBy the time a night-shift nurse realised [Barritt] was in trouble at 7.50pm, [Barritt] felt ice cold, she wasn\u2019t breathing and her temperature was so low it couldn\u2019t register on a standard thermometer. She was taken by ambulance to Harrogate district hospital, but died there later the same day.\u201d</p> <p>Maria Mallaband Care has an annual turnover of \u00a350m and has won national awards. However, Oaklands showed losses of \u00a31.75m in 2015, and \u00a34.2m in 2016.</p> <p>Tony Moule, the environmental health officer at Harrogate borough council, said: \u201cOur investigation revealed that there were a number of serious failures with regard to health-and-safety legislation.<br></p> <p>\u201cNo fine can ever compensate the family for the loss of their mother in such shocking circumstances. For an elderly vulnerable person to suffer hypothermia while in bed in her room, under the care of a national care provider, beggars belief.<br></p> <p>\u201cCare homes must take their responsibilities seriously and Maria Mallaband Care Group Ltd failed in its duty of care. We hope that this case sends out a message which will help to ensure that such events don\u2019t happen in the future.\u201d</p>",

Of the principals, Myrtha (<a href=\"http://www.stinachoreographer.com/\">Stina Quagebeur</a>) is spectacularly good, her spectral pointe work overlaid with witchy movements of the hands and face. Albrecht (<a href=\"http://www.ballet.org.uk/the-company/dancers/isaac-hernandez/\">Isaac Hern\u00e1ndez</a>) is, disappointingly, the least vividly imagined. But his love duets with Giselle (<a href=\"http://www.alinacojocaru.com/\">Alina Cojocaru</a>) are tender and fresh-minted and she herself is a beautifully judged combination of vulnerability, curiosity and earthiness.

  "<p>Jeremy Corbyn has given his second party conference speech as Labour leader, after winning another decisive mandate from the membership last week. These were the key points of his address to the main hall in Liverpool:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-conference-jeremy-corbyns-today-interview\">Jeremy Corbyn announces plans for 60,000 new council homes and higher business taxes - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>1) </strong><strong>Labour is about protest, such as winning justice for those campaigning about Orgreave and the Shrewsbury 24, but also winning power in councils and parliament.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This statement may seem obvious but it is designed to address the implied criticisms from the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and the deputy leader, Tom Watson, at this conference that Corbyn is not serious enough about becoming prime minister.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>2) Labour has not been working together and has been through a tough time because of the death of Jo Cox but he will now lead the way in uniting the party.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: Corbyn strikes a conciliatory note here, thanking his challenger, Owen Smith, and hinting he will make concessions in order to bring about peace in the party. However, Labour MPs are still wary of these fine words given that he signals at the weekend that they will still have to fight selection battles after the boundary review.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/28/andy-burnham-to-step-down-from-shadow-cabinet-labour-party-conference\">Labour conference: Andy Burnham to leave shadow cabinet</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>3) The Labour leader acknowledged that debate in the party had at times spilled over into abuse and hate, including misogyny and antisemitism, especially on social media.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This is an important recognition. Corbyn is often criticised for coupling rejection of antisemitism with a rejection of \u201cother kinds of racism\u201d as well, which some say does not amount to an acceptance that Labour has particularly struggled with accusations of antisemitism. His words are some of the strongest he has given on the subject, saying he will fight with every breath to oppose the evil of prejudice against Jewish people.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>4) Corbyn again stresses his success in increasing the party membership to more than half a million people.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This is a crucial element of Corbyn\u2019s power, as his mandate is based on the enthusiasm of thousands of people for his leadership. He is expected to use the membership to help him shape policy and perhaps even contribute to electing people to the shadow cabinet.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>5) Corbyn claims a number of policy victories as his own, including the government\u2019s defeats over tax credits and proposed disability cuts.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This is debatable. The Conservatives would have been able to pass these policies had it not been for dissent on their own backbenches.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/28/len-mccluskey-labour-deputy-leader-tom-watson-unite-union\">Len McCluskey launches withering attack on Tom Watson</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>6) The Labour leader says his election has grown out of a thirst for different politics and people being \u201cfed up with the free-market system\u201d. He promises economic solutions for the future, not the past.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: Corbyn is in effect tackling the arguments of some of his critics that he is harking back to socialist policies of the 1970s. Instead, he is linking his purpose to a new wave of anti-establishment movements across the world in which people disillusioned with the effects of globalisation are demanding change.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>7) Corbyn attacks the Tories for \u201cgerrymandering\u201d by trying to change parliamentary boundaries for the next election.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: The Labour leader strongly opposes the boundary review. But it may also be helpful to him because it will pit a number of Labour MPs against each other when their seats are abolished or changed.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>8) An attack on Sir Philip Green, the former BHS boss, goes down well in the hall.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: Corbyn points out that Green was hired by the Tories to do an efficiency review and links this to the government being wedded to a failed economic model of the past. It is part of casting himself as a candidate for change.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>9) Corbyn promises everybody a decent home, a proper living wage, secure employment rights and an end to zero-hour contracts.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: It is quite hard for anyone in Labour to disagree with this and part of Corbyn\u2019s strategy will be to unite his party on matters of domestic policy.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>10) Corbyn explains his 10 policy proposals, from not taking the country into unnecessary wars to an end to inequality. He jokes that they are not the Ten Commandments.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This is a little bit of self-deprecating humour aimed at those who claim he is treated as the messiah by his followers. The serious point is that he is on the way to successfully enshrining the points of his leadership campaign as policy, allowing him more control over the direction of the party.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>11) The Labour leader promises an end to the local authority borrowing cap, which would allow another 12,000 council homes to be built.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An earlier draft of the speech predicted 60,000 more homes, suggesting the estimate is a cautious one. This will be hugely welcomed by councils as local authority housing stock has been depleted by the right-to-buy scheme.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>12) Labour would borrow \u00a3500bn to invest in infrastructure and public services to end \u201cmanaged decline\u201d.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: Plenty of sensible independent analysts have been calling for these things. Many voters may think it essential for growth and adequate public services but others may worry about Labour again being seen to be proposing borrowing when they are yet to rebuild their reputation on the economy.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>13) Corbyn promises a \u201cnew deal for rebuilding Britain\u201d that involves raising corporation tax by 1.5% to help pay for the education of college students.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This may be the start of a new trend of \u201chypothecation\u201d in tax policy, where Labour links a specific tax rise to a specific benefit for society. The theory is that people and businesses are more inclined to stomach a tax rise that is going towards a named social good.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>14) A new \u00a3160m fund will be available to ensure schoolchildren have access to arts and culture through a special \u201cpupil premium\u201d.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: Getting every child to learn about culture and music is a personal priority for Corbyn. He may have misspoken when talking about England and Wales as education is devolved.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>15) Labour will scrap the work capability assessment.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This will be another unifier for the party. Many MPs were not happy with last year\u2019s decision to abstain on a welfare vote and Corbyn is firmly pitching his leadership as one that will stand up for people\u2019s rights to fair benefits.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>16) Corbyn stuck to his line on defending immigration, saying it was the Labour way to oppose racism, myths and division.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This is one issue of domestic policy on which there is division in the shadow cabinet. A number of frontbenchers think Labour should take from the Brexit vote that people want stronger controls on immigration.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>17) Corbyn defines his own aims of Brexit as including the freedom to intervene in our own industries, no obligation to liberalise or privatise our public services and a new relationship with Europe based on cooperation and internationalism.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: These are all laudable aims for Labour, but Corbyn does not give much detail on the central question of the Brexit negotiations: the trade-off between the single market and free movement. The end to restrictions on state aid would be significant, though, as the government would be better able to rescue struggling industries such as steel.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>18) The Labour leader reiterates his apology for the Iraq war.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This one is a crowd-pleaser, as Corbyn again takes the opportunity to draw a dividing line between his own leadership and that of the last Labour government.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>19) A Corbyn government would end arms sales to Saudi Arabia over its actions in Yemen.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> This is another major policy based on reports that Saudi Arabia has committed war crimes. Corbyn has been a long-standing critic of Saudi Arabia, which is an ally of the UK government.<br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>20) Corbyn acknowledges there is an \u201celectoral mountain to climb\u201d, especially if there is a snap election next year.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: As focus turns from the party battle to the possibility of one against the Tories, Corbyn stresses the \u201cneeds and aspirations of middle- and lower-income voters, of ordinary families\u201d which Labour must address. He again focuses on the need for a \u201csocialism of the 21st century\u201d \u2013 looking forwards rather than backwards.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>21) A rare personal passage describes Corbyn getting his socialism from his parents and working as a teacher and trade union organiser.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: The Labour leader is reluctant to talk about his family, but he refers to his teacher mother and engineer father who instilled in him a love for socialism and peace. It may be the beginnings of a project to introduce the electorate more to Jeremy the man.<br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>22) There is a big standing ovation as Corbyn finishes on the slogan: \u201cTogether, we can shape the future \u2026 and build a fairer Britain \u2026 in a peaceful world.\u201d A choir sings Jerusalem.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: Corbyn looks pleased with his performance, which was more assured and fluent than last year. There was very little of controversy in the speech for Labour critics of Corbyn to oppose. The choice of Jerusalem appears designed to dispel notions that the Labour leader does not do patriotism.<br></p> </blockquote>",

The excursion is one example of the growing human presence in an increasingly ice-free North-west Passage \u2014 the famed high-latitude sea route that connects the northern Atlantic and Pacific oceans. In mid-August 2016, the southern route through the passage was nearly ice-free.</p> <p>For most of the year, the North-west Passage is frozen and impassible. But during the summer months, the ice melts and breaks up to varying degrees.

The number and intensity of the fires varies strongly with climate anomalies such as El Ni\u00f1o and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation. These cyclical changes in ocean temperatures affect global precipitation patterns and the likelihood of drought in South America. The strong El Ni\u00f1o in 2015\u201316 reduced rainfall across the Amazon during the wet season, meaning forecasters are anticipating an unusually intense fire season.</p>",
  "<p>Among the mid-morning shoppers at a run-down precinct in the suburb of Bramley, west Leeds, barely a soul had heard their MP, Rachel Reeves, describe the area as a racially charged \u201ctinderbox\u201d on Tuesday.</p> <p>Speaking at the Labour party conference in Liverpool, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-rules-out-pledge-cut-immigration\">Reeves warned</a> that there were \u201cbubbling tensions in this country that I just think could explode\u201d if immigration were not curbed after Brexit.

The most serious of these came earlier this month when a Polish man ended up in hospital after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/14/four-teenagers-arrested-attack-polish-man-leeds\">assaulted by a group of 20 youths in Armley</a>.<br></p> <p>Ten minutes down the road, at Bramley shopping centre, a Polish shopkeeper collapsed in July in an incident his wife said was linked to the referendum weeks earlier.</p> <p>Marek Petzold, 47, was taken to hospital after collapsing inside his shop, the Koala Delicatessen.

We won\u2019t win elections like that, and we need to win elections.\u201d</p> <p>McCluskey, who is a staunch supporter of the leadership, said he thought Watson had delivered an \u201cextraordinary speech\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIt confused me, it seemed to be saying that New Labour and the \u2018third way\u2019 was the way forward again.

The real world is more complicated than that, as any practical trade unionist will tell you.</p> <p>\u201cBusinesses are where people work.

That is why it wins elections.\u201d </p> <p>McCluskey denied the party was anti-business. He also addressed the row over the suggestion from Corbyn\u2019s team that he does not believe immigration numbers should be reduced. The Unite boss said freedom of movement was an issue, but argued that the Labour leader had addressed it by talking about collective bargaining to protect workers\u2019 pay rates.</p> <p>\u201cBecause what is happening with migrant labour is it produces a cheap pool of labour that greedy bosses use to drive down wages,\u201d said McCluskey. \u201cI believe that the question of free movement of labour is a question not only in the UK but in Europe. No one talks of countries where migrant labour come from being denuded of skills. I believe issue of free movement of labour should be challenged.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>This may be premature, because we have not yet had Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech, but after four full days in Liverpool, it is possible to make some judgments about what has emerged from this year\u2019s conference. </p> <h2><strong>1) Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s re-election has strengthened his position in the party \u2013 but it hasn\u2019t decisively altered the balance of power</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-conference-jeremy-corbyns-today-interview\">Labour conference: shadow cabinet split over Corbyn's immigration comments - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Normally the moment after an election victory is when a leader is constrained the least. But for Corbyn there is no one left to sack, any frontbench promotions will be determined by who offers to serve, not whom Corbyn picks, and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-expected-to-lose-majority-support-of-labour-nec\">as the struggle over the national executive rule changes showed,</a> Corbyn cannot depend on getting Labour\u2019s key decision-making body to do what he wants. Significantly, within two days of his re-election, Corbyn effectively conceded that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/26/jeremy-corbyn-puts-aside-objections-to-renewing-trident\">for now, at least, he is giving up trying to change party policy on Trident</a>. This is a significant retreat on an issue on which Corbyn has campaigned all his life.<br></p> <h2><strong>2) Labour now feels like two parties that don\u2019t like each other any more but cannot afford to get divorced</strong></h2> <p>There has been no serious talk at all about a split, because the mechanics of the electoral system make that suicidal and both sides are emotionally attached to the Labour brand. However, there is a vast gulf between the pro-Corbyn and anti-Corbyn camps. Superficially the divide is about policy, but much more it is about whether people are prepared to make an emotional investment in Corbyn\u2019s poll-defying idealism. Labour has become a coalition and, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@OwenJones84/a-strategy-for-jeremy-corbyns-leadership-to-succeed-9ffe4c27149b#.1hw5xd6ia\">as Owen Jones suggested in a recent essay</a>, one way forward might be a proper coalition agreement. And perhaps a quad, with Corbyn, John McDonnell, Tom Watson and Hilary Benn? They could ask David Cameron and Nick Clegg for some advice.</p> <h2><strong>3) Corbyn has made little progress over the last year in fleshing out a policy platform</strong></h2> <p>The Labour MP Kerry McCarthy, who resigned from the shadow cabinet, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/21/kerry-mccarthy-im-angry-some-people-dont-care-about-being-in-power-bristol-labour-corbyn\">told the Guardian recently</a> that she had never seen Corbyn \u201cmove beyond things you could fit on a T-shirt\u201d in his policy thinking and this conference seems to bear that out. A year ago, after his surprise election as leader, Corbyn could be forgiven for only having an outline view as to what he would do. This year he has barely moved on and conference has been relatively light on policy. McDonnell did give a speech with a clear set of economic proposals but almost none of them have been worked up in any detail and his headline announcement (a \u00a310 minimum wage) was something he promised last year. Corbyn is also proposing a \u00a3500bn investment plan, but the party has released no detail about this and at the moment the plan seems to amount to nothing more than a figure on a press release. On economic policy, and even more so in other areas such as education and welfare, there is little evidence that the party has started taking difficult choices, or started engaging seriously with outside bodies on legislative proposals.<br></p> <h2><strong>4) Corbyn\u2019s critics are not united</strong></h2> <p>At the time of the \u201ccoup\u201d, shadow ministers announced their resignations on an hour-by-hour basis in a move that was clearly coordinated. But since Corbyn\u2019s re-election on Saturday there has been no agreed, group response from the MPs who left the frontbench in the hope of forcing him out. A few have said publicly that they would be willing to go back, a few more may have been speaking to Corbyn privately, and Corbyn seems confident to have enough names to be able to announce a reshuffle next week. Another group may be willing to go back, but want to delay so that they can use the offer of going back as a bargaining tool to try to get Corbyn to accept some form of shadow cabinet elections. A third group seem determined to remain on the backbenches for good.</p> <h2><strong>5) Corbyn is probably safe at least until 2018</strong></h2> <p>There is now a general recognition on the part of Corbyn\u2019s critics that this summer\u2019s leadership challenge achieved nothing and speculation about another leadership contest next year seems to have vanished. At the very least Corbyn should be safe until 2018, although there is also a widespread view that he will be able to remain leader until the general election if he wants to. After the EU referendum, MPs used the prospect of an early election as an argument for challenging Corbyn immediately. But, now that he has won, it is Corbyn who is exploiting the \u201cearly election\u201d threat and is citing it as a reason why MPs should back him.</p> <h2><strong>6) Labour is split over how to interpret the Brexit vote</strong></h2> <p>Many MPs believe that immigration was a key factor and increasingly there are calls for the party to abandon its commitment to the free movement of labour. But Corbyn sees the Brexit vote as primarily a vote against the economic status quo and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/28/corbyn-defence-of-immigration-splits-shadow-cabinet-labour\">as he confirmed this morning,</a> he is opposed to immigration controls. Interestingly, this is one issue where Labour\u2019s old right, which is sceptical about immigration, disagrees with the pro-free movement Blairite right. On this topic Corbyn is a Blairite.</p> <h2><strong>7) Labour\u2019s leaders outside Westminster are more important to the party than ever</strong></h2> <p>Devolution and the creation of elected mayors have created a new powerbase within British politics and Corbyn\u2019s opponents see it as offering the party a lifeline. Sadiq Khan openly paraded his credentials as an alternative leader this week. Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister, is being encouraged to develop a UK profile so that he can show English voters what a pragmatic Labour government can achieve. Mayoral elections next May should see other Labour figures taking executive office and in his speech on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/27/labour-conference-jeremy-corbyn-tom-watson-says-party-must-prepare-for-fourth-industrial-revolution?page=with:block-57ea9feae4b08ca277ca0c82#block-57ea9feae4b08ca277ca0c82\">Tom Watson said these figures, and Labour councillors, would be the ones who led Labour back to power</a>. Not Corbyn, he implied.</p> <h2><strong>8) In person Labour members are much more civil to each other than anyone would guess from reading the papers</strong></h2> <p>In the run-up to conference some people were predicting 1980s-style fights. In practice it has been very peaceful. The level of heckling is not much worse than at an average conference, there have barely been any raised voices and the only punch thrown occurred when Clive Lewis (reportedly) hit a wall because he was angry about Corbyn\u2019s office interfering with his speech. That is not to say that the social media abuse has not been real. But Twitter is a real world, not <em>the</em> real world, and in real space, if not cyberspace, Labour members seem to get on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/ive-got-the-power-sang-super-sadiq\">'I've got the power,' sang Super Sadiq | John Crace</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>9) Momentum is not Militant, and it can run a lively, successful conference</strong></h2> <p>One of the highlights of Liverpool has been Momentum\u2019s The World Transformed alternative conference (or festival, as it prefers to call it), taking place about half a mile away. Anyone turning up expecting a Militant re-enactment will have been disappointed. Outside there were older, hardcore lefties selling \u201cdeselect your MP\u201d literature. But as journalists such as Andrew Grice <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/jeremy-corbyn-labour-conference-momentum-world-transformed-critics-will-not-like-it-a7331036.html\">(here)</a> and Paul Mason <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/sep/26/the-real-lesson-from-corbyns-victory-you-cant-hold-back-history\">(here)</a> report, inside it was full of young, earnest, welcoming activists seemingly with no interest in becoming the next Derek Hatton. In the long run it is still not clear what impact Momentum will have on Labour, but this week its reputation has improved.</p> <h2><strong>10) Corbyn has no obvious successor</strong></h2> <p>Most parties normally have an unofficial leader-in-waiting. Often they never get the job (Yvette Cooper filled this role for Labour for much of the last parliament), but nevertheless the ULIW carries some clout. At Liverpool the position is vacant. Clive Lewis\u2019s standing as a potential, Corbyn-lite alternative leader is improving (for reasons Stephen Bush explains <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/09/what-will-labours-new-awkward-squad-do-next\">here)</a>, and some Corbyn-sceptics, such as Chuka Umunna and Lisa Nandy, have been prominent on the fringe. But for the moment Corbyn is unassailable.<br></p>",

Originally excited about the opportunity of moving to a complex nicknamed The Promised Land, some ended up moving out of the flats following water shortages while others saw a business opportunity renting out their new homes to middle-class Kenyans at several times the subsidised rate. Those who stayed still shop in the slum, where food is cheaper.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The importance of proper planning is a logistical nightmare across Latin America too. Delicate social structures can be torn down faster than the shacks the communities lived in. Claudio Acioly Jr, head of capacity development at UN-Habitat, says many delicate human factors are often overlooked: \u201cFor example, in Brazil, the number of women-headed households is enormous and there is a rich network of informal arrangements. So when you move them, you move the location of the school and remove their arrangements for someone to look after the house and kids while they\u2019re out.\u201d</p> <p>Poor planning puts extra pressures on residents. \u201cIn Mexico, where the slums were 7km away from the city centre, the housing scheme was 37km away.\u201d Nearly 5m housing units were unoccupied 10 years on, he says. \u201c[Residents moved out] because they found they had to take two methods of transport to get to work and they\u2019re in a housing estate without any shops, in the middle of nowhere.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>Myth 3: Slums should be treated differently to the rest of a city<br></strong></h2> <p>Slums are part of the fabric of many cities and many have mighty populations. The informal areas in Cairo are a good example of this. They have among the biggest populations in the region and are given names such as \u2018The City of The Dead\u2019. Out of a population of 90 million people, the Housing and Land Rights Network says at least <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.madamasr.com/news/greater-cairo-40-percent-live-informal-housing\">30% of Greater Cairo\u2019s residents</a> live in slums. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fd9fbcc50c6367f57d0993ca6cedc0ccee313cfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd9fbcc50c6367f57d0993ca6cedc0ccee313cfd/0_256_4101_2461/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The City of the Dead\u2019 in Cairo, Egypt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The City of the Dead\u2019 in Cairo, Egypt<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ahmed Mansour of the <a href=\"http://www.hlrn.org/\">Housing and Land Rights Network</a> argues that a holistic approach is needed: \u201cFor decades, Egypt has been facing a housing crisis that governments have mismanaged and the private sector has exploited. </p> <p>\u201cThe problems within slums or informal areas cannot be treated in isolation from the rest of the city since they show structural inequalities that should be tackled integrally.\u201d </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://www.citiesalliance.org/About-slum-upgrading\">slum upgrading</a> could help, as the philosophy behind the urban renewal strategy is to gradually improve informal settlements, formalising and incorporating them into cities so residents have the same rights as everyone else there. Projects vary from place to place but the idea is to provide more durable housing, increase residents\u2019 rights and connect them to infrastructure and services that other citizens have such as access to clean water.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2><strong>Myth 4: It\u2019s possible to discourage people from moving into slums<br></strong></h2> <p>Alongside population growth, urbanisation is also driving slum growth \u2013 people moving to cities to find work. Here, India is a good example \u2013 the slum situation there is so vast that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to build <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-23/modi-seeks-to-replace-crowded-india-slums-with-20-million-homes\">20 million homes</a>.

  "<p>For a decade now, the Nasa mantra for looking for life in outer space is to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/everydaylife/jamestown-water-fs.html\" title=\"\">follow the water</a>\u201d. In the beginning, this was a valid way to identify the places where we should then start searching. Each new discovery of \u201cwater\u201d is automatically paired with a statement that this increases the chance of finding alien life. But in recent years \u2013 the latest example being the discovery of water this week on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/26/jupiter-europa-water-plumes-nasa\" title=\"\">Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa</a> \u2013 we have been hearing it so often that it is starting to become boring.</p> <p>The evidence for water on celestial bodies such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/sep/28/nasa-scientists-find-evidence-flowing-water-mars\" title=\"\">Mars</a>, Europa and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/oct/22/spacewatch-clark-saturn-moon-enceladus-water-plumes-cassini-flyby\" title=\"\">Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus</a> is now overwhelming.

We still do not know how life began on Earth. If we could find some elsewhere, we could look to see how similar or different it was from Earth life. Does it rely on DNA, for example? Do its similarities and differences hold clues about how it, and therefore we, were formed?</p> <p>However, this is where the risk and the fear of failure lies. Despite what you might think from the news stories, water is no guarantee of life. Water is certainly a prerequisite on Earth and there are good scientific reasons for believing water may be essential for life of any description, but there is no guarantee that a watery celestial body will automatically play host to microbes.</p> <p>Perhaps this is the reason that Nasa has seemed strangely reluctant to take the next step of actually looking for life. Earlier this century, they shied away from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_Planet_Finder\" title=\"\">Terrestrial Planet Finder</a>, a telescope designed to look for Earth-like worlds and analyse their atmospheres for traces of life.

Scientists said they had seen what looks like geysers shooting water into space from Europa, which has long been known to contain a global ocean. Scientists have repeatedly speculated that microbial life might be found underneath this moon\u2019s ice surface and have spent decades wondering how to get below the ice to look for it. Now that the water is jetting into space, nature is doing all the hard work. A craft could fly through those plumes, sample the water and look for life.</p> <p>By a piece of cosmic good fortune, Nasa is planning a mission to Europa. Yet the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/26/jupiter-europa-water-plumes-nasa\" title=\"\">using that mission to look for the evidence of life in those plumes was virtually dismissed</a>. \u201cThe Europa flyby is not a life-finding mission,\u201d said programme scientist Curt Niebur. \u201cThat mission is focused on finding the habitability of Europa.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eceaf72def8118c191a9babac3a426b3b057a63b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eceaf72def8118c191a9babac3a426b3b057a63b/162_65_1477_1648/896.jpg\" alt=\"Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa.\" width=\"896\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It is time for vision and commitment.\u2019 Nasa image of Europa shows suspected plumes of water vapour erupting at the bottom left.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NASA, ESA, W.

What better way is there to determine Europa\u2019s habitability than to look for life?</p> <p>Nasa was not always this timid. In the 1970s it sent two landers to the surface of Mars. These <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/datablog/2016/jul/23/forty-years-of-missions-to-mars\" title=\"\">Viking missions</a> carried experiments to look for life. The results were deemed inconclusive and then simply not followed up. This could have been a mistake. A recent re-analysis of the data suggested that, while the results fell short of a clear detection of Martian life, there were enough positive indicators to warrant a follow-up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/stephen-hawking-light-years-dangerous-aliens\">Why Stephen Hawking is light years from the truth about \u2018dangerous aliens\u2019 | Seth Shostak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps in response, Nasa has now quietly stated that its next Mars rover in 2020 will also look for life. But at least the European Space Agency is proving bolder.

That search should now be extended to Europa.</p> <p>There is admirable scientific caution, and there is ducking the challenge. To go to Europa now without the ability to look for life is the latter. It is time for vision and commitment: discovering life on another planet would send shockwaves through science and fundamentally transform our understanding of our place in the universe: we must step up the search.</p>",

  "<p>Where a confluence of rivers meet the Peruvian city of Iquitos, the world\u2019s largest city to be inaccessible by road, lies Bel\u00e9n, a partially floating shanty town and market where endangered monkeys change hands for a few dollars and wildlife traffickers take orders to stock informal zoos or private collections with the abundant fauna from the world\u2019s largest rainforest.</p> <p>Wildlife is part of the town\u2019s daily trade. A ban on selling bushmeat is openly ignored in Bel\u00e9n\u2019s market. Deep-auburn slabs of the smoked meat of the endangered South America tapir (<em>Tapirus terrestris</em>) are stacked high on trestle tables. The protruding hoof of a peccary or the paw of an agouti betray the fact that there is hunted game on sale.</p> <p>A yellow-footed tortoise (<em>Chelonoid denticulata</em>), <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/9008/0\">listed as vulnerable by the IUCN red list</a>, is butchered for the pot while still quivering, its head moves from side to side.

You may think you can save them but if you buy them she will understand that \u2018gringos\u2019 \u2013 white people \u2013 like to buy monkeys and they\u2019ll keep on taking them from the wild.\u201d</p> <p>A Bel\u00e9n local who works as an informal tour guide told the Guardian on condition of anonymity that bigger species such as woolly, spider and squirrel monkeys were kept in homes where he sometimes took tourists or collectors working for informal zoos. Collectors from neighbouring Ecuador or Colombia often use small private aircraft to transport animals out of the country, he alleged. </p> <p>Local traffickers buy animals from ribere\u00f1os, poor riverside dwellers, as they come to market in Bel\u00e9n. In secret locations large numbers of tortoises, terrapins or parrots are stored for potential clients, he said. He alleged police officers can be bribed for a small quantity of animals, and documents permitting animals to be transported out of Peru can be bought from corrupt officials. </p> <p>Airport security makes it harder to traffic animals by plane so most are taken upriver along the Amazon to Pucallpa, capital of the neigbouring Ucayali region, and from there by road to Peru\u2019s Pacific coast.</p> <p>No one has ever been jailed for wildlife trafficking in Peru, confirmed Yovana Murillo of the <a href=\"https://peru.wcs.org/en-us/home.aspx\">Wildlife Conservation Society Peru</a>.</p> <p>Responding to allegations of corruption in the regional government, Rengifo said public servants were very badly paid which \u201csometimes led to criminal acts\u201d. Enforcement in this trafficking hub compared unfavourably with other Amazon regions. Between January and July 2016, Loreto had seized only 447 live animals around a third of the 1,478 live animals confiscated in neighbouring San Martin region in a similar period (January and August 2016), according to Peru\u2019s environmental police records. </p> <p>The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) has identified 383 animal species being trafficked in Peru over the last decade on well-run routes from more than 40 markets in 10 cities including the capital Lima. Supplied by Iquitos and other Amazon cities, parrots or monkeys are often seized at border crossings. But an estimated nine out of 10 trafficked animals die en route, says Murillo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"83fb82247ead2fbe7f660c5d0d945ab3b93e160f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83fb82247ead2fbe7f660c5d0d945ab3b93e160f/0_351_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bald-headed uakari monkey grooms Gudrun Sperrer, founder of the Pilpintuwasi Animal Orphanage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bald-headed Uakari monkey grooms Gudrun Sperrer, founder of the Pilpintuwasi Animal Orphanage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Collyns/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If they are lucky, rescued monkeys will be taken to <a href=\"http://www.amazonanimalorphanage.org/\">Pilpintuwasi Butterfly Farm and Animal Orphanage</a>.

The monkeys only live in a small part of the Amazon basin in Peru and Brazil. </p> <p>Wildlife trafficking has always been rife in Loreto, says Sperrer, but it is getting worse. Traffickers are deliberately encouraging hunters in the village near her refuge to target monkeys with babies, she said.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe idea is \u2018you can eat the mother and sell me the baby\u2019. That will mean future generations are already dead,\u201d she said despondently. Increasing numbers of well-meaning tourists who buy baby animals thinking they can rescue them had worsened the situation, she added.</p> <p>But even the people employed to protect wildlife were involved, she alleged. \u201cIf they\u2019re told: \u2018We\u2019re going to take this monkey to a zoo where it\u2019s being taken care of, where we have the money to study the species\u2019, they make papers, they sign papers that are fake.\u201d</p>",

But Manchester also voted for remain, and at 13,554 had nearly double the level of net migration seen in Birmingham, which voted leave.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The pattern is starkest at the local authority level. Lambeth in London, which recorded the highest remain vote, of 78%, saw a net influx of 4,598, while Castle Point in Essex, which includes Canvey Island, voted 72% for leave, after a net inflow of 81 international migrants in 2015.</p> <p>In Conservative Wandsworth in London, net migration was 6,295 and 75% of voters backed remain, while in Labour Hartlepool there was a net inflow of 113 and 69% of people voted to leave.</p> <p>It is true that areas such as Boston in Lincolnshire and Fenland in Cambridgeshire, which have had high levels of net migration, also feature in the top 10 leave areas. But these are isolated areas that have seen the most rapid population change, in places with little history of overseas migration. They are also the most in need of the kind of flexible rapid response migration impact funding that Labour pioneered in 2008 to help relieve pressure on housing, GP surgeries, policing and schools \u2013 funding that was scrapped by the Tories as ineffective.</p> <p>The problem with Labour\u2019s migration impact fund was that Gordon Brown refused to allow any Treasury contributions. Instead a \u00a350-a-head levy was imposed on non-EU migrant visas, and it never raised more than \u00a350m, which did little to ease the pressure points. A new migration impact fund \u2013 the Tories have promised a smaller-scale version \u2013 needs to be a much more serious effort.</p> <p>But what about that Brexit vote? Won\u2019t leaving the European Union mean deep cuts in immigration can now be delivered? Surely ending free movement to close the door on unskilled labour from the rest of Europe would bring down net migration to the tens of thousands from its near record level of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/net-migration-to-uk-fell-to-327000-in-past-year-figures-show\">327,000 in the year to March</a>.</p> <p>Theresa May has tried to pull every lever over the past six years to deliver that promised deep cut in the net migration numbers. Despite her abject failure as home secretary to reduce net migration to less than 100,000, she has made it to No 10.</p> <p>What could she do in a post-Brexit world to make good on that broken pledge? She could, as many of her former cabinet colleagues such as George Osborne have suggested, take overseas students \u2013 163,000 came last year \u2013 out of the net migration figures on the grounds that they come to study rather than settle in the UK. But she has repeatedly ruled that out, claiming too many stay on after their studies and dismissing the option as \u201cfiddling the figures\u201d.</p> <p>Restricting the free movement of labour from within the EU is a possibility. Around 179,000 EU citizens arrived in Britain to work last year, of whom 101,000 had a definite job to go to. The other 78,000 came looking for work. </p> <p>Any new work permit system is likely to give a visa to those with a definite job offer, even on a temporary basis for less skilled occupations. The jobseekers could face restrictions, but even if they were all banned it would not deliver the deep cuts sought. It would also probably provoke retaliation, denying the right to work to some of the 1.2 million Britons currently working and living in Europe.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/blog/entry/restricting-immigration-wont-pay-for-working-people?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=20160927restricting-immigration-wont-pay-for-working-people\">New Economics Foundation analysis</a> on Tuesday goes further and suggests that restrictions on free movement, far from ending undercutting, could actually reduce wages further, because experience shows that if migrants cannot come legally they will try to come illegally.</p> <p>The truth is that Britain\u2019s economy remains relatively buoyant and will continue to attract EU migrants, legally or illegally, while it remains the jobs factory of Europe. In fact, migrant labour is helping to fuel that economic growth. The only sure way to deliver deep cuts in immigration is to crash the economy. Corbyn is wise not to promise that. It would turn Project Fear into Project Fact.</p>",
  "<h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EofnxCTy8Ms\">Echoes</a></h2> <p>Having midwifed the more exhilarating variety of psychedelia as the co-writer of Eight Miles High, Gene Clark left the Byrds in early 1966 \u2013 a move triggered, in a much noted irony, by a fear of flying. The following year came Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers, a glorious countrified psych-pop album, and more than distinctive and original enough to establish him as a major act in his own right. In a decision probably more clumsy than malicious, but one that prefigured the misfortunes of Clark\u2019s entire subsequent career, Columbia records timed its release in direct competition with his old band\u2019s Younger Than Yesterday, on the same label, and it tanked. Its lambent, artfully scored opening track, taking a stately stroll through the twisting paths of inner space, was perfect for its moment. Alas, its moment never got to hear it.<br></p> <h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fO57oiYgQkk\">So You Say You Lost Your Baby</a></h2> <p>Lost love was Clark\u2019s creative engine; his former bandmates had always looked forward to his turbulent personal life going awry, because of the songs they\u2019d get out of it. This hallucinatory stormer, also from his debut LP, is an urgent, pounding, organ-driven (in several senses) account of the tripped-out mind as much as the cracked-open heart. Clarke was a superb vocalist, one who merits consideration alongside Scott Walker and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/mar/02/nina-simone-10-of-the-best\">Nina Simone</a>. As a lyricist, he needed to be heard rather than read; his ornate, often mystical and sometimes overwrought writing can fall flat on the page, but it soars on record.<br></p> <h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjNA0q5YY2A\">Polly</a></h2> <p>Ever ahead of a game he somehow always ended up losing, Clark had included country and bluegrass on his first album, well before the Byrds recruited Gram Parsons and recorded <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Dc4by2zw0\">Sweetheart of the Rodeo</a>. Two years on, he teamed up with bluegrass banjo maestro Doug Dillard, and a band including future Eagle Bernie Leadon plus other leading sidemen of the new country-rock movement, for a splendid pair of rootsy albums, The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard &amp; Clark and Through the Morning, Through the Night. Their quality and influence would later be acknowledged with the inclusion of two songs from the latter on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/14/folk.shopping\">Robert Plant and Alison Krauss\u2019s 2007 Americana hit, Raising Sand</a>. One was the title track, the other, this. Dillard and Clark\u2019s haunted, gorgeous original is slow, clear, stark and heavy with longing \u2013 country music\u2019s primary emotion, for which Clark, with his rich, tempered vibrato and yearning lyricism, had a particular affinity.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b98f5b7906a16aa7db7e5be205ab7e2b4d1792c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b98f5b7906a16aa7db7e5be205ab7e2b4d1792c7/0_3_3852_2312/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Byrds of a feather \u2026 Gene Clark (second right) with the Byrds in an overliteral London photoshoot in August 1965.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Byrds of a feather \u2026 Gene Clark (second right) with the Byrds in an overliteral London photoshoot in August 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victor Blackman/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ5qwIqLGkM\">The Virgin</a></h2> <p>In 1971, Bob Dylan was the elephant in every singer-songwriter\u2019s room, and he was bound to loom particularly large when the room belonged to a former Byrd. Clark was always too singular, too idiosyncratic, to be a straight-up Dylan imitator, which is perhaps why Dylan, who unjustly scoffed at Donovan, held him in such high regard. The plain, folky, largely acoustic album White Light was as close as Clark ever came to sincere flattery of Dylan \u2013 and while it wasn\u2019t all that close, it stands among the finest of that era\u2019s many records unmistakably beholden to the master. On opening track The Virgin, the measured, honeyed, philosophical tale of a girl in the big city, his inflection veers towards Dylan\u2019s \u2013 but he never gives himself over to pastiche. Nor would he ever, even when it might have benefited him. Perhaps he genuinely didn\u2019t know how.<br></p> <h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB6y1bkCQow\">She Don\u2019t Care About Time</a></h2> <p>Clark often reworked his own songs. His later versions of Feel a Whole Lot Better and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gamTAp1W4Mc\">Train Leaves Here This Morning</a> are wonderful, but this is the ne plus ultra of his revisions. Still feeling his way around country rock on the recordings that would be collected on the Roadmaster album, in 1972 he turned to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlS2JhaBJM\">a classic he wrote for the Byrds</a>, the epitome of all things jangly, and rendered it something else entirely. Baroque and suffused with tenderness and wonder, it is one of those overwhelming tracks devotional not only in a romantic but in a quasi-religious sense. The best known such number is, perhaps, the Beach Boys\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOMyS78o5YI\">God Only Knows</a> \u2013 and you wouldn\u2019t want to live on the difference between that and this.

No Other (1974) eventually became synonymous with the phrase \u201clost masterpiece\u201d. Initially celebrated for its obscurity \u2013 it was deleted by Asylum in 1976, reissued in 1991, then given the bells-and-whistles treatment in 2003 \u2013 it is now celebrated for its magnificence. It was in every way a magnum opus: epic, sprawling, poetic, choral, rococo. It cost a small fortune to record, and the already erratic Clark never got over its commercial failure. Its opening song is an exuberant, foot-tapping country-gospel anthem stuffed with counterculture folk wisdom, its downbeat lyric defied by its pure joie de vivre.<br></p> <h2>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GilrLIwBJE8\">No Other</a></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jul/29/gram-parsons-10-of-the-best\">Gram Parsons</a>, in some ways a parallel figure to Clark, had a vision of a cosmic American music; Clark lived to fashion one of his own. The title track of his masterwork pulses, glows and rattles in a thrilling meld of country and funk, gospel and rock, with echoes of the Family Stone, Staple Singers, Gimme Shelter and Abbey Road (Anglophilia being a strain unacknowledged in Americana, but not by Clark). It\u2019s unique not only in his own catalogue but perhaps in all of pop music.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jul/29/gram-parsons-10-of-the-best\">Gram Parsons \u2013 10 of the best</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>8. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ViQXg_0bw\">Some Misunderstanding</a></h2> <p>Here it is: the centrepiece of the No Other album and indeed of Clark\u2019s career: a slow, eight-minute cry from the heart, reflecting on the perils and pleasures of a life lived too extravagantly. For Clark, who would surely have recognised William Blake as a spiritual progenitor, the road of excess had at last brought him to the palace of wisdom \u2013 and what a palace his is. It is a song to be dwelt in, to walk about within, exploring its chambers, curlicues and turrets. It is in most ways the antithesis of his sharp, concise writing of a decade previously, yet what stayed with Clark throughout was soul and soulfulness.<br></p> <h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc-Po3KAqE4\">All I Want</a></h2> <p>Come the 80s, Tom Petty and REM were making the Byrds\u2019 60s sound fashionable again. In 1982 Clark recorded what would be released two years later as the Firebyrd album (later expanded and issued in the UK as This Byrd Has Flown). Again, circumstances (and perhaps self-sabotage) conspired against him; even when blatantly courting the main chance and invoking his past at every turn, he couldn\u2019t catch a break. All I Want sounds like a prototype for later, poppy hits by the Traveling Wilburys and former bandmate Roger McGuinn; an updated, 80s-style Byrds. It is, by Clark\u2019s standards, facile, a plaintive courtship of radio play. Yet it illustrates how he was quite incapable of divesting what he did of resonance and beauty.</p> <h2>10. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqhQ7T92Wu4\">Gypsy Rider</a></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5ruo6h6AG\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j5ruo6h6AG?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In 1986, five years before his drug- and alcohol-hastened death at 46, Clark recorded his final studio album, So Rebellious a Lover, with the roots singer Carla Olson. It includes this lovely piece, in the traditions both of biker and rambling-man\u2019s-gotta-be-free songs.

  "<p>For every Geoff Cameron in the Premier League there\u2019s a Michael Bradley in Major League Soccer. Two talented players in their prime, one playing in the coveted Premier League and the other trading the heights of Europe with Roma for the expansive suburbs and big money on offer in Toronto. (You mean Bradley went to Canada to win trophies?) What\u2019s less well known is that almost 150 Americans are contracted to professional clubs around the world, from Germany to Israel to Azerbaijan and many other places in between. We spoke to three American players trying to make their name a long way from home:</p> <h2><strong>Mayowa Alli, </strong><strong>KI Klaksvik, Faroe Islands</strong></h2> <p>Let\u2019s get this out of the way early. Mayowa Alli has eaten whale. He\u2019s eaten whale jerky and barbecued whale. When you live on an isolated island in the North Atlantic, it\u2019s what you do.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/27/carli-lloyd-memoir-us-women-soccer\">Carli Lloyd's memoir explodes myth that US women's soccer is all fun and friends</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSome people would say eating whale is barbaric but I learned to look at it from their perspective,\u201d Alli says. \u201cI only had it once. I can\u2019t give you a sophisticated review \u2013 but it was good.\u201d</p> <p>Alli plays in defence for KI Klaksvik, a team in the Faroe Islands Premier League, and has a track record in adapting to new surroundings. Born in Nigeria, his family moved to the US when he was four, and he grew up in Lanham, a small Maryland town between Washington DC and Baltimore. \u201cI thought eating goat meat was normal until I went to elementary school and everyone else told me it was weird,\u201d he says.</p> <p>A talented high school soccer player, Alli was recruited by Bucknell University in Pennsylvania and named all-American in 2013 by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America. His college coach said Major League Soccer teams were interested. The league\u2019s Superdraft, where college players are called up to pro teams, beckoned. But Alli didn\u2019t get a call.</p> <p>\u201cThe draft system is a bit weird,\u201d he explains. \u201cIn the major US sports it has been so successful but MLS is not always like that. They\u2019re picking foreign players and the college system is not the league base.\u201d</p> <p>Alli had a choice. Stay home in America, cool his heels on a pro career, and put his political science degree to use \u2013 or look abroad. Then Bucknell alumni Conor O\u2019Brien, playing professionally in Denmark, joined some dots, and Alli boarded a plane for Copenhagen.</p> <p>On his first day in Denmark, Alli trialed with the reserve team of a third-division club \u2013 a long way from the European glamor portrayed by the Champions League on TV. He was offered a contract, joined first division (second-tier) club Vendsyssel the following season, before he was sent on loan to KI Klaksvik in the Faroe Islands\u2019 10-team Premier League.</p> <p>The Faroe Islands are an archipelago in the Norwegian Sea with a population of around 50,000. Klaksvik is the second-biggest city \u2013 actually, town \u2013 with a population of just over 4,000. The capital, Torshavn (literally \u201cThor\u2019s Harbor\u201d), claims 13,000 inhabitants.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re walking down the street and you see someone\u2019s grandmother, you say hi,\u201d says Alli. \u201cYou don\u2019t buy your fish from the supermarket. You get it from a fisherman. If you need something fixed, you call your uncle. If you need something sewn, you call your grandmother.\u201d</p> <p>Still, while playing pro soccer in the Faroe Islands may appear off the beaten path, Alli says he\u2019s learned things he doubts he would have picked up in the US. \u201cYou get here and learn so much,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are some basic things players get here at a young age that I\u2019m learning when I\u2019m 22 years old. Imagine if I\u2019d learned this when I was 16 or 17?\u201d</p> <p>Mikkjal Thomassen, Klaksvik\u2019s 40-year-old coach, says Alli has worked hard to inject what he calls an \u2018holistic approach\u2019 to his football. \u201cFor us, a central defender is not just a defender,\u201d Thomassen says. \u201cWe put a lot of responsibility to build the play as well. Mayowa is exceptional in his physical capacity \u2013 his ability to jump and strength and courage. That is his force. He is at the international level for that.\u201d</p> <p>Faroe Islands teams can field four foreign players. Many come from Denmark or Eastern Europe and are either starting careers or ending them. A top import can make around $6,000 a month, with a car and housing thrown in. Other players earn closer to $3,000.</p> <p>Game day attracts almost 3,000 people to the team\u2019s stadium which is almost more people than the official population of the town. KI Klaksvik also has a successful women\u2019s team. Imagine Friday Night Lights set on an isolated island between Norway and Iceland.</p> <p>\u201cThe team has a huge impact on daily life, and they say that the factories can that measure people work harder when we win,\u201d says Thomassen, who was the Faroe Islands\u2019 police chief of narcotics for 15 years before becoming a full-time football coach. Last year, Alli also worked part-time as a carpenter. \u201cYou can\u2019t just have one occupation in the Faroes,\u201d adds Thomassen.</p> <p>The league doesn\u2019t just attract international players from Europe. Last season, Alli\u2019s teammates also came from Nigeria, Cameroon, and Senegal.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I\u2019d go over to their house and eat west African food,\u201d Alli says. \u201cI was surprised they could get the ingredients but they found some. There was a Nigerian guy who owned a pizza shop here. You\u2019ll never know what you\u2019ll find when you go around the world.\u201d</p> <p>Alli\u2019s loan deal with KI ends in December. If the team finishes in the top four, (they\u2019re currently top of the table) there\u2019s a chance to qualify for the Europa League. Alternatively, Alli, now 24, will return to Denmark.</p> <p>\u201cSome players are maybe afraid of being in a whole new world,\u201d Alli says. \u201cBut you are young and you will never know what\u2019ll happen. It\u2019s worth a shot. If the football doesn\u2019t work out for you, it is still a great experience to have.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Adan Coronado, </strong><strong>AZAL, Baku, Azerbaijan</strong></h2> <p>Adan Coronado grew up in Hawaiian Gardens, California, south of Los Angeles and not far from Huntington Beach. These days, though, Coronado lives in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, on the Caspian Sea. Baku and the Caspian Sea are not known for sun and surf. In fact, Baku roughly translates to \u201cwind-pounded city\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was like: \u2018Oh, where\u2019s Azerbaijan?\u2019\u201d Coronado recalls when he learned AZAL, a team in Azerbaijan\u2019s Premier League, was interested in signing him. \u201cI went on Google and said: \u2018Where\u2019s this place at?!\u2019 I saw it was under Turkey: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a little further out from home. It\u2019s <em>way</em> over the pond.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>AZAL is the latest stop on something of a tour of professional soccer\u2019s lesser known leagues for Coronado. Blooded into the game by his Mexican-born father, Coronado (now 26) was an accomplished high school player but shunned the traditional college pathway in favor of, effectively, a talent show.</p> <p>Handing over $300, he entered a combine \u2013 a kind of America\u2019s Got Soccer Talent \u2013 in Los Angeles. Players that made a cut were not invited to Hollywood but offered an expenses-paid trip to Germany as part of an 18-man squad to play matches against local teams. The hope was to be be spotted by a European agent or a scout, or, well, <em>anybody</em>.</p> <p>\u201cI always had a curiosity to play overseas if I had the chance,\u201d Coronado says. \u201cWhen the combine came up I thought, \u2018OK, this is the way I can get there\u2019. I took the chance and left everything \u2013 college, family. I was 21 years old. As a soccer player, if you want to be a professional, that was late. But I thought, I\u2019m not going to lose anything, so why not?\u201d</p> <p>In Germany, the midfielder was subsequently invited to trial with several clubs and offered a contract with Kickers Emden in Germany\u2019s third tier. \u201cIt was a traditional club, well organized, and with a fanbase,\u201d Coronado says. However, it was also a club with serious financial problems and dropped into Germany\u2019s (effectively, amateur) fifth tier.</p> <p>\u201cI was a little surprised,\u201d admits Coronado.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fac7579d2e7284d5761fa9dca20db6a3198d063\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fac7579d2e7284d5761fa9dca20db6a3198d063/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Azerbaijan fans show their support in Baku.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Azerbaijan fans show their support in Baku.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But not perturbed. Friends of friends of friends put him in contact with clubs in Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina, where he played for two seasons. The professional dream was still alive. Then came the call from Baku. <br></p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know this guy, so at first it was kind of sketchy,\u201d Coronado says of the sometimes shadowy world of agents and contracts. \u201cThey introduce themselves, but you don\u2019t know who they are, so it is risky. You don\u2019t know who you are talking to, sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>Today, almost a year later, Coronado is proudly the only Mexican-American playing in Azerbaijan\u2019s eight-team Premier League. \u201cI was the first one!\u201d he laughs. When he arrived in Baku the club produced a mini-documentary on him. \u201cThey were like, what\u2019s going on?! They filmed me and wanted to know about my culture. Mexican-American is different here.\u201d</p> <p>Coronado\u2019s non-Azerbaijan team-mates are Georgian, Chinese, and Iranian. \u201cNot that many people speak English here \u2013 it\u2019s Turkish and Russian,\u201d he says.</p> <p>As a kid, Coronado\u2019s favorite player was Manchester United\u2019s Eric Cantona. He\u2019d watch games from Europe on TV at home in California. His father would talk about the games and how soccer in Europe was different to America. \u201cI wanted to see that and experience that,\u201d Coronado says.</p> <p>But reality is a little different to the glamor of TV images \u2013 and not just geographically. \u201cAt first I had to just get by with the little salary they provide,\u201d Coronado explains. \u201cThey help you out with housing and the little I earned I\u2019d spend on food, and the rest I\u2019d save for a trip back home. That\u2019s how it starts off in the lower leagues. Everyone who is here in Azerbaijan wants to go to England, Spain, France, or Germany. They are looking to get out.\u201d</p> <p>Away from his family \u2013 \u201cThey haven\u2019t visited yet, they\u2019re always working, you know how it is\u201d \u2013 and his girlfriend, Coronado spends his downtime running a newly-launched fashion label with a teammate. With an eye on his post-soccer career, the label \u2013 called Left1 \u2013 pitches designer T-shirts as the kind of clothes pro soccer players wear.</p> <p>\u201cI will come back home eventually, but I want to explore the world and learn about different cultures,\u201d Coronado says. \u201cMaybe I should be comfortable and have a stable life, but I want to learn and take away things from the world. Every time I go back home they say: \u2018Are you going to stay this time?\u2019 I say: \u2018No, maybe next time\u2019.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Shaquell Moore, </strong><strong>Atletico Levante, Valencia, Spain</strong></h2> <p>For Shaquell Moore, the worst part was not getting paid. For five months. And not just the American teenager. The entire team did not get paid for almost half a season. Welcome to life in Europe as a professional player.</p> <p>\u201cThe Spanish guys had family here and had someone to lean on, but I had to stand by myself,\u201d Moore recalls of his first season in Spain. \u201cBut to be honest, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been in a better locker room. Everyone stayed positive and helped each other. It was bad but it was good. It helped me a lot. I know I\u2019m able to tough it out even when I wanted to drop everything and go back home.\u201d</p> <p>Moore, 19, has football in his blood. His father Wendell played for Trinidad &amp; Tobago, representing his country three times during a qualification campaign for the 1986 World Cup. (Canada joined hosts Mexico as Concacaf\u2019s representatives in the finals). Growing up in Florida and Georgia, Shaq Moore was a rising star with US national youth teams, captaining the under-17 side, playing for the under-20s at the 2015 World Cup in New Zealand, and winning a Major League Soccer contract with FC Dallas.</p> <p>\u201cThe traditional pathway is that you go to high school, you go to college and start a career there,\u201d Moore explains. \u201cI thought I had the ability to skip college and test the waters overseas. I have nothing against MLS, the league is growing, but I wanted to try Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Playing with the US under-18 team in the 2014 Copa del Atlantico, a friendly tournament in the Canary Islands, Moore attracted interest from Spanish scouts. A release from Dallas after just four months opened the door wider. Moore tooks trials at Valencia, Levante, and Huracan.</p> <p>\u201cYou enter an environment where you don\u2019t really know anyone and you are basically coming in to take someone\u2019s spot,\u201d Moore explains of trialing at professional clubs. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to give you the ball and they don\u2019t want you to shine.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Moore won a contract with Huracan, a team in Spain\u2019s third tier, but the club soon hit financial problems that would ultimately lead to its demise as a professional club in late 2015. Moore then won a deal with Real Oviedo, playing for its reserve team, before he signed with Levante at the end of the recent August transfer window.</p> <p>\u201cHuracan, and not getting paid, was one of the times when I asked, do I really want to be here?\u201d Moore says. \u201cBut those experiences do make you stronger.\u201d</p> <p>Moore as dropped off the national team radar after signing for Huracan and not playing for its first team. Speaking via phone from Valencia (after taking a Spanish lesson), he says he has no regrets about shunning MLS and moving to Europe. His education is not just tied to language classes.</p> <p>\u201cThe culture here is soccer, soccer, and soccer,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe people are crazy about it and everyone is enthusiastic \u2013 even at the reserve team games. Spain is a soccer country.</p> <p>\u201cThe other difference with the US is the technical ability of the players. At home, the focus is on bigger players and who can run the fastest and be the most physical. Here, you can be physical but you also have to have a brain for the game and good technique. It\u2019s more competitive because there are a lot of players and everyone is good. Even in the lower divisions.\u201d</p> <p>Moore has signed a two-year deal with Levante. His plan is to break into the Levante first team (they currently plays in the second tier while the reserve side play in the third) and recapture the attention of the US national team. He jokes that he won\u2019t say he\u2019s taking it one day at a time. Two years at a time? That\u2019s different. By 2018 he\u2019ll be 21. A two-year deal with a professional team in Spain is kind of like college \u2013 but very different.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone here in Spain is fighting to make it to the top,\u201d he says. \u201cHere it\u2019s soccer or nothing.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Alicia Machado became an American citizen just in time to vote against Donald Trump. It\u2019s a vote that has been a long time coming.</p> <p>In May 1996, the Venezuelan beauty queen was just 19 years old when she was crowned the winner of the Miss Universe pageant, which had recently been bought by the Manhattan business mogul. That year should have been one of sheer happiness and possibility for Machado, and for a moment it was. \u201cI remember I hug my mom and I tell her, now our lives is going to be changed forever,\u201d she told the Guardian in an interview in her adopted hometown of Los Angeles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/donald-trump-alicia-machado-miss-universe-fox-and-friends\">Trump attacks Alicia Machado again: 'She gained a massive amount of weight.

It wasn\u2019t just that Trump shamed her about about gaining weight, calling her things like \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d and \u201can eating machine\u201d. It wasn\u2019t even that he did so publicly. It was that he did it with the biggest audience he could find, in an attempt to sear her weight fluctuation into the public consciousness, forever changing how she would be remembered.</p> <p>Then on Monday night, in a twist of cosmic justice, Trump \u2013 now the Republican nominee for president \u2013 was presented with a bigger audience for his comments about Machado\u2019s weight than he ever could have imagined, or wanted.</p> <p>In what has been billed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra\">the most-watched debate in presidential history</a>, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton made Trump\u2019s remarks to Machado a centerpiece of their first televised clash, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/donald-trump-alicia-machado-miss-universe-fox-and-friends\">citing the name-calling</a> \u2013 in particular, Trump calling her \u201cMiss Housekeeping\u201d in reference to her Latina origins \u2013 as a prime example of her opponent\u2019s demeaning views about women.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s treatment of Machado reached its nadir in January 1997 when, having put the recently crowned Miss Universe on a stringent diet and exercise regime, he scheduled a trip with her to a New York City gym. There he blindsided her with dozens of cameramen, who gathered to film her jumping rope, lifting weights and pedaling a stationary bike. Trump cast himself in the role of disapproving dad, leaning over Machado as she hid her mortification behind a show of charms only the world\u2019s top beauty queen could have mustered, laughing along with reporters and even once planting a kiss on Trump\u2019s cheek.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"182c369144cbcc05e3426777492f101cf5a3bc56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/182c369144cbcc05e3426777492f101cf5a3bc56/0_0_1478_1790/826.jpg\" alt=\"Alicia Machado of Venezuela reacts as she is crowned Miss Universe on 17 May 1996.\" width=\"826\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alicia Machado of Venezuela reacts as she is crowned Miss Universe on 17 May 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Draper/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although she appeared happy, smiling for the crowd of cameras as she dutifully skipped rope, she tells the Guardian she felt like a mouse in a cage, running endlessly on her fixed wheel for the entertainment of others. \u201cI was in some gym in New York like a mouse,\u201d she said. \u201cLook at that mouse: how she run, how she jump, how she make exercise.

Though she had never suffered from eating disorders previously, in the years that followed the ordeal at the gym, she struggled with anorexia and bulimia. It took five years before she was fully recovered, and longer before she could talk about what she went through. Now she hopes to use the insights gleaned to help teenagers struggling to love their bodies.</p> <p>\u201cNo matter what, no matter who tells you that you don\u2019t look good, that is only outside,\u201d she said, speaking partly, perhaps, to her younger self. \u201cYou are more than some weight. You are more than some phase. You are more than if you are short or tall, or you are black or you are white, or you are skinny or fat or whatever. Your value is how you can work, how you can feel for the people around you.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cIn this moment 20 years later, the only thing I need to say is I\u2019m a really happy person. I\u2019m a very successful person. I have my family, my daughter, my career, my dreams, my ideas.\u201d Referring to Trump\u2019s character, she said: \u201cAnd he can\u2019t be a president of the United States of America.\u201d</p> <p>That Machado is thriving these days was readily apparent from where she sat in her publicist\u2019s fourth-floor office in West Hollywood, and apparent in many different realms. She has traded pageants for success as an actor, starring in a string of telenovelas \u2013 a childhood dream come true. She is also a successful businesswoman, with a line of products bearing her name. And she is the proud mother of a seven-year-old girl, whose privacy she fiercely protects; a question about whether she would encourage her daughter to compete in beauty pageants was met with stern disapproval.</p> <p>More recently, she has added another title to her list of identities: activist. In June,<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/former-miss-universe-civil-rights-legend-delores-huerta-team-up-against-trump/2016/06/15/a287616e-3313-11e6-8758-d58e76e11b12_story.html\"> Machado teamed up with civil rights icon Dolores Huerta</a> in Virginia to join immigrant advocacy groups in encouraging Latinos to register \u2013 and to vote for Clinton. She took her own advice to heart, too. On 19 August she became a registered US citizen, pledging in a<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BJS8lOEjhGV/\"> post on Instagram</a> to cast her ballot for Clinton. Later that month she traveled to Florida to lend her star power to a Clinton campaign drive to register Latino voters, posting video excerpts from the trip to social media accounts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"I so proud and inspiration to be a U.S. Citizen!

Both have been broadly insulted by Trump, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/02/donald-trump-racist-claims-mexico-rapes\">has called Mexican immigrants \u201crapists\u201d</a> and regularly refers to women as animals; Machado has the dubious distinction of being the recipient of both racial and gender-specific slurs, a powerful reference point that certainly isn\u2019t lost on the Clinton campaign.</p> <p>\u201cAlicia Machado has seen first hand the dangerous impact Trump\u2019s hateful and divisive rhetoric can have on people,\u201d a Clinton spokesperson said of Machado\u2019s involvement with the campaign. \u201cAs a Latina, as a first-time voter and as a respected leader in the Latino community, Alicia has become an invaluable voice of our campaign to help mobilize Latinos against Trump\u2019s bigoted agenda and to educate the community about Hillary\u2019s plans to build a better future for them.\u201d</p> <p>In the first presidential debate on Monday, Machado\u2019s value could scarcely have been more evident. Clinton\u2019s strongest moment in an already impressive debate performance \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/clinton-trump-debate-analysis\">arguably her strongest moment in the cycle</a> \u2013 came near the end when she seized on a question about what Trump had meant when he had said she didn\u2019t \u201clook\u201d presidential. Trump tried to deflect the damaging line of inquiry, saying he had actually been questioning her stamina. Clinton wasn\u2019t having it; and she used the concrete details of Machado\u2019s story to pull him back in the ring of fire.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trump-trade-blows-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54q33\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2754975\"            data-video-name=\"Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump trade blows \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters / AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ea1adfe4b0a785ec48bdc4\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/27/160926wrap_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/27/160926wrap.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/27/160926wrap_V3.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trump-trade-blows-video\">Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump trade blows</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cHe tried to switch from looks to stamina, but this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs, and dogs, and someone who has said, \u2018Pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers.\u2019 Who has said, \u2018Women don\u2019t deserve equal pay unless they do as good of a job as men,\u2019\u201d Clinton said as Trump tried to protest.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest,\u201d Clinton continued. \u201cHer name is Alicia Machado and she has become a US citizen, and you can bet she\u2019s going to vote this November.\u201d It was a rare moment in which Trump\u2019s words were effectively weaponized against him. And, for the first time all debate, Trump had noticeably lost his cool, switching focus to offensive comments he had made about TV personality Rosie O\u2019Donnell and saying: \u201cI think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.\u201d</p> <p>Another measure of the attack\u2019s effectiveness came the following morning, when Trump was asked on Fox and Friends what, if anything, from the debate had gotten under his skin. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/donald-trump-alicia-machado-miss-universe-fox-and-friends\">Without hesitation he singled out Machado</a>. \u201cShe was the worst we ever had, the worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible,\u201d he said of the former beauty queen.</p> <p>\u201cShe was the winner and she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a problem,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cWe had a real problem, not only that, her attitude and we had a real problem with her. Hillary went back into the years and found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa and it wasn\u2019t quite that way, but that\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/fat-people-rise-up-we-could-swing-this-election\">Fat people, rise up!

It\u2019s a similar case with his continued insistence on how right he is to call women out for their weight. Machado understands this, perhaps even more acutely than Clinton, because she\u2019s lived it; and she is willing to relive and keep reliving this painful episode if it means shedding light on a man she feels has no business anywhere near the Oval Office.</p> <p>On a call organized by the Clinton campaign on Tuesday afternoon billed as a chance to let Machado respond to Trump\u2019s most recent attacks, the former beauty queen was much more interested in talking about his Democratic rival, whose mention of her story in the debate the night before had moved her to tears. She \u201cnever imagined it would matter to someone so powerful\u201d, she said. </p> <p>But as someone who straddles two powerful voting blocs this election cycle, Machado is a double threat to Trump, and she feels that her celebrity means she has a responsibility to speak up about her experiences when they can help people. \u201cIf I can be a voice for my Latino community in this moment, I will do it,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just a matter of Trump: a few years ago she survived a battle with breast cancer, and as a person of faith, she said she struggled to make sense of why God sent her such a challenge. Tearing up ever so slightly for the first time in an hour-long interview, she said she finally determined it was because she needed to share her story: \u201cPeople believe in my words,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople look at me as a strong person. That is my character \u2013 I\u2019m a strong woman.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Two weeks ago, 13 September, was the 23rd anniversary of the signing of the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7385301.stm\" title=\"\">Oslo agreement</a>, Shimon Peres\u2019 diplomatic masterstroke that was supposed to lead to a peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinians. In the early afternoon, a rocket streaked across the Mediterranean, clearly visible from the windows of his office in the Peres Peace Center near Jaffa\u2019s coastline. It was carrying a spy satellite, made by the Israeli Aerospace Industry that Peres had founded over half a century earlier. The rocket was a civilian version of the Jericho missile, reported to be the launcher of Israel\u2019s nuclear weapon, developed by the project founded by Peres in the 1950s.</p> <p>That evening, as he was being rushed to hospital in the early stages of a massive stroke from which he would not recover, a new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/us-israel-aid-38-billion-record-military-assistance\" title=\"\">$38bn military aid deal</a> was announced in Jerusalem and Washington. It had been Peres who had signed the first arms deal with the United States in 1963.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/shimon-peres-former-israeli-leader-dies\" title=\"\">Shimon Peres, who has died at the age of 93,</a> spent the first half of his public career building Israel\u2019s military might and ensuring its security. The second half was focused on increasingly forlorn attempts to bring peace to his country. The sad irony of his life was that he had been much more successful in his first chapter. His efforts to reconcile the Jewish state with its Arab neighbours failed to achieve similarly lasting results.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0a38dc4f0ef31038dc55c3e4804103b62f88431\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0a38dc4f0ef31038dc55c3e4804103b62f88431/17_405_2035_1222/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shimon Peres\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shimon Peres: \u2018the sad irony of his life was that he had been much more successful in the first chapter, building Israel\u2019s military might.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GPO/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Peres had resigned from frontline politics at the age of 54, as many of his colleagues were demanding, after having lost the 1977 general election as leader of the Labour party to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Begin\" title=\"\">Likud\u2019s Menachem Begin</a>, he would be remembered as one of Israel\u2019s most legendary security \u201chawks\u201d. The man who had purchased the arms for Israel\u2019s army during its early years and conducted the secret negotiations with France for the supply of the Dimona nuclear reactor. The first patron of the Jewish settlers in the West Bank. Instead, most of the eulogies now being written in his memory are extolling him as a man of peace. For a man who loved to talk of his own experiences and thoughts, Peres never explained the transformation he underwent in the wilderness of opposition.</p> <p>His many detractors said that Peres simply had no choice. With Begin and Egyptian president Anwar Sadat ending the state of war between the two nations and signing the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Camp-David-Accords\" title=\"\">Camp David peace agreement</a>, he had no choice but to move leftwards and try to present himself as a better peacemaker than his Likud rivals. His supporters explained that Peres knew more than anyone else just how strong and secure Israel had become, and could therefore make concessions and take risks for peace in its dangerous neighbourhood. Whatever his motives, he failed to convince the Israeli public with his vision.</p> <p>He led the Labour party in five general elections between 1977 and 1996 and failed each time win an outright victory. His best result was a stalemate with Likud in 1984 which meant he had to share power with his hardliner opponent, Yitzhak Shamir. In two years as prime minister he was busy mainly with stabilising the economy and pulling most of Israel\u2019s troops out of Lebanon. In 1986, he became foreign minister and began secretly negotiating with Jordan\u2019s King Hussein. But the London agreement they reached, which could have launched a peace process including the two countries and the Palestinians as well, was vetoed by Prime Minister Shamir. Peres simply did not have the political or public support to defy him.</p> <p>Six years later, he succeeded, once again as foreign minister, in persuading a reluctant and sceptical <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/13/newsid_3053000/3053733.stm\" title=\"\">Yitzhak Rabin to go along with the Oslo process and shake hands with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat</a> on the White House lawn. The international community recognised the breakthrough by giving the three men a joint Nobel peace prize, but it was Rabin who had won the election and sold the agreement to the Israeli public. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/31/night-yitzhak-rabin-was-assassinated\" title=\"\">Rabin\u2019s assassination</a>, Peres was left to carry Oslo on his own and lost yet again.

While opinion polls showed a majority of Israelis in favour of his positions, in principle, at the ballot box they preferred a stern rightwinger in government. They were willing to trust Labour only with a reassuringly tough retired general leading the party, like Rabin or Ehud Barak. Prime minister Peres simply wasn\u2019t a combination of words that inspired enough confidence and security.</p> <p>Perhaps the final irony of Shimon Peres\u2019 life was that his last act in the service of peace, remains secret and undocumented. As an octogenarian president, he observed the conventions of the ceremonial office and refrained from openly intervening in politics. That didn\u2019t stop the commanders of the army and chiefs of the intelligence services turning to him for advice when they felt their political masters were dangerously wrong. Towards the end of his seven-year term, he was the secret leader of the faction within the defence establishment that successfully worked to block the plans of Netanyahu, the prime minister and the defence minister Ehud Barak to launch a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/23/leaked-spy-cables-netanyahu-iran-bomb-mossad\" title=\"\">military strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear installations</a>, before it could build an atomic bomb.</p> <p>Ultimately he had to rely on the generals and spy chiefs to avert war. He never convinced ordinary Israelis to make the same leap of faith he had.</p>",
  "<p>Jeremy Corbyn has mounted a forceful defence of immigration from the EU and elsewhere before his party conference speech, causing a fresh split in his shadow cabinet.</p> <p> The Labour leader is expected to use his speech to promise a Labour government will not \u201csow division\u201d by promising to cut immigration.</p> <p> His position suggests Labour will not respond to the Brexit vote by seeking curbs on free movement of people across the EU, but senior shadow cabinet ministers have said there must be controls and the current system is in chaos.<br></p> <p> Speaking on BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday morning, Corbyn said he understood \u201cthe problems that can come in some areas\u201d, which is why he would create a \u201cmigrant impact fund\u201d to ease pressure on public services.</p> <p>He added: \u201cMigrants that have come to this country make an enormous contribution to it. Our conference understands that and Tom Watson put that case very well about the work that migrants have done in the NHS and education and other industries ... we should live with that but also understand the number of British people.\u201d</p> <p> Pointing out that numbers vary from year to year, Corbyn said there were many industries such as farming that depended on migrant labour.</p> <p> Asked if people should stop worrying about immigration, he said: \u201cWe have to allay people\u2019s concerns about the impact ... and recognise the huge contribution made to our economy and the numbers of people working in the NHS that are pretty crucial to the survival of the NHS.\u201d</p> <p> Corbyn suggested the UK should continue to accept free movement from the EU, while maintaining access to the single market on the same basis as other member states.</p> <p>But some of his frontbench allies were already striking a different tone, including Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, and Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary.</p> <p> In a conference intervention, Burnham will say: \u201cLabour must face up fully to this fact: millions of our lifelong supporters voted to leave the EU and voted for change on immigration.\u201d</p> <p> Rayner told BBC there must be \u201ccontrols\u201d and described the current system as chaos. \u201cWe have to have controls on immigration, that\u2019s quite clear,\u201d she told BBC News. \u201cYou have to know who is coming in to your country and who is leaving your country.</p> <p> \u201cWe have to got to make sure that our economic situation is good for everybody because immigration is a good thing for us, but what undermines [that] is when people feel that it is unvetted and that we are not able to deal with the issues and the concerns that people have around that.\u201d</p> <p> Corbyn repeatedly said during the referendum campaign that he did not believe Britain should seek to cut immigration. The Labour leader will tell conference on Wednesday: \u201cA Labour government will not offer false promises. We will not sow division or fan the flames of fear.

They have lost patience with the refusal of the nuclear-armed states to fulfill their obligation to disarm. Moreover, they rightly see the massive and expensive nuclear re-armament programs underway in these states as confirming their bad faith and recklessly endangering our collective security.</p> <p>The working group recommended \u2013 by a majority of more than three to one \u2013 that the general assembly mandate negotiations, to start next year, on a treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons.

  "<p>There is a quiet power to Simon Norfolk\u2019s black-and-white study of what looks like an ordinary staircase in a nondescript house. What strikes you first in this photograph \u2013 which features in a new exhibition called <a href=\"http://www.michaelhoppengallery.com/exhibitions/139/overview\">? The Image as Question</a> \u2013 is how the light plays on each polished surface: the gleaming handrail and pristine skirting board, the gloss-painted wall. It is then you notice that the surface of each stair is not straight but gently curving, worn by the footsteps of those who have walked down them over the years.</p> <p>The French thinker Roland Barthes identified what he called the punctum: the crucial, often accidental, detail of a photograph that reveals something deeper. The curve of the worn stairs is not an accidental detail in Norfolk\u2019s photograph, but the crucial element in the composition that, as Barthes put it, \u201crises from the scene\u201d with a force that makes it suddenly seem like a new photograph. Those who walked down these stairs, leaving the imprint of their vast numbers, were heading towards their deaths in the gas chambers at Auschwitz. It is a photograph that evokes horror in the most subtle and affecting way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"461b7e9e69a93a48eaa2d1cc0172c98e61cf8d91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/461b7e9e69a93a48eaa2d1cc0172c98e61cf8d91/0_0_701_1050/668.jpg\" alt=\"September 11th, New York, NY 2001 by Melanie Einzig.\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">September 11th, New York, NY 2001 by Melanie Einzig.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melanie Einzig. Courtesy Michael Hoppen Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPart of the fascination with all photography is that the medium is firmly grounded in the documentary tradition,\u201d Michael Hoppen notes in his introduction to the show. \u201cIt has been used as a record of crime scenes, zoological specimens, lunar and space exploration, phrenology, fashion and importantly, art and science. It has been used as \u2018proof\u2019 of simple things such as family holidays and equally of atrocities taking place on the global stage. Any contemporary artist using photography has to accept the evidential language embedded in the medium.\u201d</p> <p>That last sentence perhaps provides the subtext to the exhibition, which concerns the threatened position of documentary photography in an age of digital profligacy. Photographs are now so ubiquitous and, when shared on social media, often so unmoored from their context as to seem drained of meaning. The images here, Hoppen insists, have \u201ca shared gravitas, a weightiness that emanates from their documentary function\u201d.</p> <p>That is certainly true of Norfolk\u2019s image of the stairs at Auschwitz, but its power also comes from its formal and compositional poetry: the fall of the light, the geometry of curves, horizontals and verticals, the perspective that, as Norfolk has noted, echoes that of an earlier image: <a href=\"http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/photographs/frederick-h-evans-a-sea-of-steps-5717415-details.aspx\">Sea of Steps</a>, a staircase in Wells Cathedral made to appear almost celestial by Frederick Evans in 1903. It is not so much a photograph as evidence, then, rather an evocation of the immeasurable human suffering that took place on this ordinary-looking site.</p> <p>The exhibition roams far and wide, from photography as research material for painters to images made by microscopic and telescopic cameras to the inevitable grisly crime scene shots by accomplished ambulance chasers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2015/mar/31/the-best-of-weegees-new-york-street-photography-in-pictures\">Arthur \u201cWeegee\u201d Fellig</a> and his Mexican counterpart, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/21/enrique-metinides-photography-dead-mexico\">Enrique Metinides</a>.

But over time the ocean smashed away two grand piers as well as Portpatrick\u2019s future as a transport hub. When the crossing moved to nearby Stranraer, sailor numbers dwindled. Villagers knew that to get them back, they needed to improve the harbour with modern moorings and improved toilet facilities while keeping its charm, or risk losing precious tourist revenue to competing harbours up and down the coast.</p> <p>The harbour\u2019s private owners, Portpatrick Harbour Ltd, had applied in 2007 to build a 57-berth marina and fix pontoons to the listed harbour floor. Councillors quashed the plans, saying it was \u201ccompletely inappropriate for the conservation of the area\u201d. Locals then looked for a way to bring the harbour into community ownership where it could be maintained and improved in keeping with the village. They formed a trust, and by 2012 the villagers had reached an agreement with the owners to buy it for \u00a3350,000, financed through money from a local windfarm and a \u00a3125,000 loan from the owners themselves, which had to be repaid by 2015.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/184368484\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/184368484\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Portpatrick: how community shares saved a village </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Banks and other lending institutions had balked at lending the trust the money to repay the loan for a harbour that had, since its purchase, been valued at only \u00a375,000. And because it needed to finance debt, the trust wasn\u2019t eligible for government grants or other types of non-profit funding like the marine coastal communities fund set up by Danny Alexander, then deputy treasurer in the coalition government, to address the desperate plight of declining seaside towns.</p> <p>When Calum Currie, an offshore oil technician born and bred in the village, joined the trust in December 2014, he realised there was no way the community would be able to pay back the loan by the deadline. Currie sent a letter round calling locals to the village hall for an extraordinary general meeting. In January 2015, 160 people gathered to discuss what to do next.</p> <p>Currie contacted Community Shares Scotland (CSS) \u2013 a scheme funded by the Big Lottery Fund Scotland and Carnegie UK Trust. He hoped Portpatrick Trust might be eligible to become Scotland\u2019s first community benefits society, which would allow it to sell shares in the harbour to secure it into community ownership.</p> <p>Since 2009, more than 100,000 people have invested \u00a3120m of share capital into 400 community businesses across the UK. Dozens more schemes are in the pipeline, funding everything from local pubs to huge renewable energy schemes.

Emails were sent to regular visitors. Shops and stores advertised the share sale to tourists. The launch date was set for the annual folk festival in September, when the harbour would likely be full.</p> <p>Robert Erskine, a lifeboat coxswain at Portpatrick since 1984, was among those going between the boats at the festival selling shares in the harbour for a minimum of \u00a325. Each shareholder got one vote, no matter how many shares they bought. This key difference from other kinds of ownership structures prevents large investors from taking over. But few investors buy community shares to make money or wrest control. \u201cA lot of people bought shares for their grandchildren,\u201d Erskine says. \u201cIt made people feel part of the community.\u201d</p> <p>In just three weeks, Portpatrick had raised enough money to save the harbour, with the 554 shareholders coming from as far away as Canada and Bermuda. Currie was elected chair of the Portpatrick Harbour Community Benefit Society. \u201cWithout community shares we would have been dead in the water,\u201d he says. \u201cThe financial benefits of the community share sale allowed us to find a future when there were no other avenues open to us.\u201d</p> <p>In Scotland\u2019s more remote communities, radical action has a rich history. \u201cMany Scottish communities are remote enough that they\u2019ve just got to get on and find a way to make things happen,\u201d says McIntyre. These projects aren\u2019t always in response to budget cuts, but the result of positive changes in the way people look at community ownership, according to Jim Metcalf, head of practice at Carnegie UK. \u201cCommunities are finding ways to fund things that would have never happened without public support,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/27/hastings-pier-reopens-after-restoration-project-heritage-lottery-fund-east-sussex\">Hastings Pier reopens following \u00a314.2m restoration project</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The community shares network runs parallel with an active Scottish community land movement, which started not long after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/aug/04/kirstyscott\">Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust</a> was formed in 1997 to save the island from centuries of absentee landlords. The Scottish government got its <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Environment/land-reform\">Community Land Act through Holyrood earlier this year </a>and has recently allocated \u00a310m a year until 2020 to support communities trying to invest in land buyouts.</p> <p>Holyrood has also bolstered asset buyouts with a <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Topics/People/engage/CommEmpowerBill\">Community Empowerment Act</a>, passed last year, to help people take control of local assets when council resources fall short. Portpatrick wanted to use the act to acquire a strip of overgrown wasteland by the harbour to tidy it up and turn it into a picnic area. But the act was so new that the council didn\u2019t have the paperwork. So Currie negotiated directly with them instead. \u201cWe said that we\u2019re not the kind for hanging around, and \u2013 fair play to them \u2013 they worked with us,\u201d he says.</p> <p>By employing members of the community, the benefits society has turned the wasteland into freshly mown lawn and installed new moorings in the harbour. It is negotiating with the council to take over the running of some communal toilets and to modernise facilities.</p> <p>Currie dreams of fixing up the village hall using the money earned from mooring fees; expected to be \u00a320,000 this financial year. \u201cWhat better way to save your community hall than off the back of your harbour. Together the two of them are stronger, and we could go on to save something else,\u201d he says.</p> <p>With each small improvement, the society must make sure the harbour is running a profit, so shareholders can get their money back if they want it. \u201cNow we know the harbour won\u2019t get spoiled or used for some individual\u2019s private gain,\u201d Currie says.</p> <p>A year on from the share offer, Portpatrick is becoming the poster child for community action. Currie has been invited to give evidence to Scottish parliamentary committees about community ownership models. Kevin Stewart, the SNP minister for local government and housing, sees the harbour as part of a broader movement of local residents doing things for themselves.</p> <p>\u201cPortpatrick shows how a community can take control of its own future,\u201d he says. \u201cHanding decision-making to local people, especially in choosing local spending priorities, is exactly the type of activity we want to see more of.\u201d</p> <p>Not-for-profit organisations are also watching closely. \u201cThe Portpatrick Harbour Community Benefit Society is an inspiration. It is this kind of new political and economic energy that is needed to reverse years of neglect and decline,\u201d says Fernanda Balata, project lead on coastal and marine environment at the New Economics Foundation thinktank. Nef is putting together the <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/entry/blue-new-deal\">Blue New Deal</a>, which advises coastal communities across the UK that lack funding and are looking for other means to help themselves.</p> <p>Currie says that for the communities at the heart of the movement, it\u2019s not all about the money. \u201cFor the community to have control of the harbour and for everyone to have a voice, that\u2019s priceless,\u201d he says.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Portpatrick is part of a series of local economies documented at </em><a href=\"http://www.farnearer.org/\"><em>farnearer.org</em></a><em>, with funding from the Friends Provident Foundation <br></em></p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 September as Portpatrick was once the main crossing to Donaghadee not Donegal<br></em></p> <p><em><br></em></p>",

While the fashion industry ties itself in knots trying to balance heritage with the zeitgeist and tradition with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/snapchat\">Snapchat</a>, Dolce &amp; Gabbana has an idiot savant\u2019s instinct for shows with an uncomplicated appeal that leaves the purists breathing its dust. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43c7ee345b8f6fa7f58e4ba0631fdb18a662a772\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43c7ee345b8f6fa7f58e4ba0631fdb18a662a772/0_0_3456_5159/670.jpg\" alt=\"Dolce &amp; Gabbana SS17.\" width=\"670\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dolce &amp; Gabbana channels gelato at its SS17 show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"22187ac524c6d064a91252a3f923eeeb4efb412e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22187ac524c6d064a91252a3f923eeeb4efb412e/0_0_2501_4256/588.jpg\" alt=\"Italian food meets fashion at D&amp;G.\" width=\"588\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italian food meets fashion at D&amp;G.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SIPA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A T-shirt dress modelled on a tin of tomatoes has all the aesthetic sophistication of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2016/sep/04/make-donald-trumps-next-great-caps-again-also\">Make America Great Again cap</a>, but that\u2019s exactly the point. This is the year of the anti-intellectual, the year when the experts became the bogeymen. Dolce &amp; Gabbana has a business rooted in skilled craftmanship and expert tailoring \u2013 its stores are still full of beautifully tailored suits, and refined cocktail wear \u2013 but it has the instinctive emotional intelligence to grasp that, in 2016, the most effective message is the simplest one. Italian food and emoji-level communication: what\u2019s not to love?</p> <h2><strong>3 Versace: athleisure\u2019s legacy for this party season will be the comfortable evening shoe</strong><br></h2> <p>Donatella Versace and Miuccia Prada are the two polar opposite grande dames of Milan fashion week, so it is a significant moment when the two of them agree on a look. At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/versace\">Versace</a>, the first two models on to the catwalk wore a sporty version of an evening sandal, heeled but with <a href=\"http://www.teva.co.uk/\">Teva</a>-style wide, velcro-tabbed straps rather than spindly, piano-wire buckled ones. At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/prada\">Prada</a>, medium-heeled evening sandals had sparkle at the front, but the same sporty-utilitarian vibe at the ankle strap. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e0092879f4a52c2a992195580d4b3c7314ecd3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e0092879f4a52c2a992195580d4b3c7314ecd3e/0_0_2606_3909/667.jpg\" alt=\"Sportswear upstyled at Versace SS17.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sportswear upstyled at Versace SS17.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Estrop/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The athleisure aesthetic does not sit as naturally in Milan as it does in New York, where sporting chic is at the heart of style heritage. (The Italian TV presenter at Versace who complimented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams\">Serena Williams</a> on being \u201c<a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/09/every-supermodel-walked-the-versace-spring-2017-show.html\">so sporty</a>\u201d seemed to sum up the way in which female athleticism is still treated almost as an eccentricity here.) Until recently, this was reflected in catwalks where tracksuit bottoms and go-faster striped collections were worn with wobbly stilettos. But the prime party-season takeout is the long-awaited triumph of the dancefloor sandal over the taxi shoe.</p> <h2><strong>4 Prada: the skirt is back</strong><br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/anna-wintour\">Anna Wintour</a> pointed to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/13483916/milan-fashion-week-spring-2017-mfw-anna-wintour-video/\">the appropriation of normal clothing</a>\u201d as a theme of the Milan shows. There were hotel slippers at D&amp;G and anoraks at Versace, but the spiritual home of the elevated-normal will always be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/prada\">Prada</a>. After last season\u2019s sailor hats and corset belts, Prada was back to doing what Prada does best, which is offbeat versions of normal clothes. Key points to note: the skirt \u2013 which has been mostly sidelined from recent catwalks in favour of crazy trouser shapes \u2013 was very much back here. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1878078fe3f2a3064bb15c446845724bb246e5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1878078fe3f2a3064bb15c446845724bb246e5c/0_0_3168_4748/667.jpg\" alt=\"A detailed skirt at Prada SS17.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A detailed skirt at Prada SS17.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giannoni/WWD/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is probably a good commercial move, because a glance around the audience reveals that everyone is still wearing those foil skirts from, like, three seasons ago, so clearly there\u2019s a market for a fancy skirt. Observe, also, the deliberately nausea-inducing colour combination, which is what makes this outfit look fashion and is the reason why the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/duchess-of-cambridge\">Duchess of Cambridge</a> with her matchy-matchy, tone-on-tone wardrobe never ever looks fashion even when she\u2019s in head-to-toe McQueen or Preen.</p> <h2><strong>5 Fendi: the prime rib is the new cold shoulder</strong><br></h2> <p>In the afterglow of the July couture show, staged on a glassed-over Trevi fountain, Fendi is a serious fashion force right now. This week\u2019s catwalk show took looks that were hovering on the edges of our vision and pulled them into focus. Knitted sock boots put a pretty spin on a sellout piece from the cult <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vetements\">Vetements</a> line; pinafore-shape dresses looked grownup and elegant; handbags boasted the ornate guitar-strap handles that will dominate in 2017. But the central message was in the sweaters \u2013 simple and long-sleeved but cropped or slashed to show the lower ribs. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76b987c8c713dfbaa8c18ca5a21647a5da3258e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76b987c8c713dfbaa8c18ca5a21647a5da3258e4/0_0_3093_4638/667.jpg\" alt=\"Simply styled prime rib at Fendi SS17.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simple and sleek prime rib at Fendi SS17.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victor Boyko/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Say goodbye to the cold shoulder, and get ready for the prime rib. This trend is unlikely to have the same mass appeal \u2013 the allure of the cold-shoulder being precisely that this is a body part normal women feel confident in revealing, which doesn\u2019t translate to the torso \u2013 but the look certainly seemed to make an impression on Fendi front-rower Serena Williams, who sported an ab-flashing sweater for her next fashion week appearance at Versace.</p>",
  "<p>The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has been urged to back an amendment to the children and social work bill that would speed up the process of bringing child refugees to the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/02/child-refugees-calais-failed-by-britain\">Hungry, scared, and no closer to safety: child refugees failed by Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The legal amendment to give child refugees in Calais the protection of UK safeguarding rules, which would create a proper system of bringing unaccompanied youngsters to Britain, has been tabled in the House of Lords on the initiative of the Labour MP Stella Creasy.</p> <p>Creasy said she had secured the votes of several Tory MPs who had committed to supporting the amendment once it reached the Commons, including Sarah Wollaston MP, from Totnes, but it is understood she has yet to receive any formal backing from the Labour party\u2019s leadership. The leader\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the Labour party conference will debate the protection of child refugees and Creasy\u2019s Walthamstow constituency party has put forward a motion for Labour to adopt the safeguarding amendment as party policy.</p> <p>The proposed change to the act obliges the Home Office to treat unaccompanied child refugees at the camp in the French port as potential UK citizens, because many qualify for transfer under the Dubs amendment, passed in March following the efforts of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/25/syrian-refugee-children-kindertransport-1939\">Labour peer and former child refugee Alf Dubs</a>.</p> <p>Dubs and the Rev Paul Butler, the bishop of Durham, put the proposed amendment to the House of Lords last Thursday.</p> <p>Extending child safeguarding to cover the refugees would mean there would be a panel responsible for each child, with an assigned guardian, to make decisions on their future welfare, health and education. No formal system currently exists to assess children who have the right to sanctuary in Britain.</p> <p>Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour\u2019s refugee taskforce, will back the amendment in a speech to conference on Wednesday and will also back the call from the French and British children\u2019s commissioners for both countries to immediately agree to each take half of the 1,000 lone child refugees.</p> <p>She will say: \u201cNow France says they will dismantle the camp by Christmas, moving people to accommodation centres across the country where their asylum claims will be assessed. And they are right to do so. The camp is dangerous.</p> <p>\u201cBut there are no places for lone children. No safe accommodation for the child refugees alone in the camp to go [to]. Last time they cleared the camp, many of the children just disappeared.\u201d</p> <p> The move has been backed by a coalition of charities include those working in the Calais camps, including the Red Cross, Citizens UK, Refugee Action, Help Refugees, UK-based human rights and child protection charities including the NSPCC, City of Sanctuary and Liberty as well as the International Rescue Committee, which is run by a former Labour foreign secretary, David Miliband.</p> <p>In a joint letter, the NGOs said unaccompanied refugee children need a proper system to process their claims to come to the UK. \u201cImplementation of the Dubs amendment requires a fast-track process for unaccompanied refugee children with family in the UK, rather than the patchwork system kept going by volunteers and charities.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it needs a proper process of safeguarding and access to protection for unaccompanied children without family. No eligible child should spend another winter in the Calais \u2018jungle\u2019 or in unsafe refugee camps elsewhere in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Children in refugee camps across Europe \u201crisk their hopes and dreams being squashed by an intransigent bureaucracy which prevents them accessing legal routes to safety. Without access to these routes desperate children are left facing a terrible choice between train tracks on the one hand and people traffickers on the other.\u201d</p> <p>Unicef UK has also called on the government to support the safeguarding amendment.</p> <p>On Monday the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande confirmed that the makeshift camp would be \u201ccompletely and definitively dismantled\u201d and campaigners are concerned about the scattering of more than 1,000 unaccompanied refugee children. France has said it hopes to find 9,000 new places in reception centres by winter.</p> <p>Hollande called for the UK to redouble its efforts to solve the crisis, saying he would like to see British authorities \u201cplay their part in the humanitarian effort that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/france\">France</a> is carrying out here and will continue to carry out in the days to come\u201d. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 September 2016. Stella Creasy\u2019s proposed safeguarding amendment is to the children and social work bill rather than an immigration bill, as we said in an earlier version of the opening paragraph.

She noted that debates also influence polls, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/hillary-clinton-polls-convention-trump-election-data\">writing in August</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the past, debates have had a big influence on the number of people who say they will vote for a given candidate. After the 2004 and 2012 convention seasons, both George W Bush and Obama were able to hold onto their convention bumps for a few weeks. (For Bush, his post-convention bump lasted about a month. For Obama, his numbers stayed high for two weeks.)</p> <p>But, in both cases, the candidates\u2019 poll numbers took a hit after the first debate.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-debates/\" data-alt=\"How debates affect candidate's poll numbers\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-debates/\">How debates affect candidate's poll numbers</a> </figure>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite trailing Bush in the polls for much of the fall of 2004, a majority of viewers polled thought John Kerry won the first debate. The candidates sparred over the war in Iraq for nearly two-thirds of the debate, and Bush\u2019s defenses appeared weak in the face of Kerry\u2019s persistent criticisms. Bush subsequently lost around five points of his polling lead.</p> <p>A similar scene played out again in 2012, between another incumbent, Obama, and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Despite trailing in the polls, Romney was well prepared for the first debate, and Obama \u2013 often glancing at his notes \u2013 didn\u2019t perform particularly well. More than seven in 10 Americans told Gallup that Romney did a better job, which was reflected in post-debate polls when Obama\u2019s lead decreased by around three points.</p> <p>If Clinton\u2019s current lead holds up by the first debate in late September (which would be a very long post-convention bump indeed), her debate performance could once again change the balance of the race.</p> </blockquote> <p>Clinton\u2019s post-DNC bump had disappeared almost entirely by yesterday, with the latest shows pre-debate showing the pair neck-and-neck. </p> <p>But largely favorable reviews across the board for Clinton\u2019s debate performance may now affect polls - even if that may not reflect the eventual election winner.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea8416e4b08ca277ca0bdd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T14:53:34.851Z\">3.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mary J Blige interviews Clinton</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hip hop queen Mary J Blige interviewed Hillary Clinton for a new show to be unveiled on Apple Music Friday, with a preview showing Blige questioning Clinton about race and singing to her. </p> <p>\u201cA lot of people in my community think Obama was blocked in Congress because he was black.

It was the debate of debates,\u201d Trump declared at 7am.</p> <p>Trump said he thought the NBC Nightly News host did a \u201cfine\u201d job, although he argued that he got asked much tougher questions, including about his support of the birther conspiracy, his refusal to release his tax returns and former employees\u2019 lawsuits against him.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t ask her about the emails. Didn\u2019t ask her about her scandals. Didn\u2019t ask her about the Benghazi deal she destroyed. He didn\u2019t ask her about a lot of things ... Didn\u2019t ask about her foundation,\u201d said Trump.</p> <p>He also echoed his claim made after the debate last night, that after Clinton grilled him on his treatment of women, including former Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, he wanted to bring up Bill Clinton\u2019s extramarital affairs but didn\u2019t out of respect for their daughter Chelsea Clinton.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel comfortable doing it with Chelsea in the room,\u201d said Trump.</p> <p>But he said he might mention the affairs in the next debate. \u201cI may hit her harder in certain ways. I really eased up in certain ways because I didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Trump admitted that Clinton\u2019s comments about Alicia Machado riled him up, as he tried to explain his \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d comments about her:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cShe was the winner, she gained a massive amount of weight, it was a real problem,\u201d said Trump. \u201cNot only that, her attitude, we had a real problem with her.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>He noted that the comments happened years ago and says the Clinton campaign \u201cfound a girl and talked about her as if she was Mother Theresa and it wasn\u2019t quite that way, but that\u2019s OK, Hillary has to do what she has to.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/780737548725485568\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;She gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem.&quot; \u2014Trump just defended his attacks on Fmr.

In the room they couldn\u2019t hear me, not exactly great ... I wonder if it was set up that way,\u201d said Trump.</p> <p>He said his mic dropped in and out. \u201cI don\u2019t want to believe in conspiracy theories. But it was crackling. To me, it was a bad problem,\u201d said Trump.</p> <p>When he was specifically asked about the sniffling, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No, no sniffles. No, the mic was very bad, but maybe it was good enough to hear breathing. But no sniffles. No allergies. No cold.</p> </blockquote> <p>So this was just a microphone?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MashableNews/status/780585590844563457\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrumpSniffles?src=hash\">#TrumpSniffles</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/debatenight?src=hash\">#debatenight</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/fpn9bA19bd\">pic.twitter.com/fpn9bA19bd</a></p>&mdash; Mashable News (@MashableNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MashableNews/status/780585590844563457\">September 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Biden\u2019s review</h2> <p>Vice-president and Clinton supporter Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/joebiden/posts/10153743738876104\">was on Facebook last night</a> after the debate to criticize Trump over his bragging that he hadn\u2019t paid federal taxes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Donald Trump all but admitted he hasn\u2019t paid federal taxes on his income. He says that makes him smart. But what does that say to the factory worker or the nurse or the teacher earning $40,000 or $50,000 or $60,000 a year and paying almost 15% of their income to support our troops, keep our neighborhoods safe and clean, and rebuild our roads? Does he really think these patriotic Americans are not smart? He\u2019s a guy who is proud of a phrase he made famous: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <h2>In today\u2019s campaign movements:</h2> <p>Trump is off to Melbourne, Florida, for a rally tonight (reporter Ben Jacobs will be there). His VP pick Mike Pence was supposed to hold and event in Wisconsin, but that\u2019s since been cancelled. Clinton\u2019s hosting a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, and has her surrogates out in force today. Her VP pick Tim Kaine has a canvass kickoff in Orlando, while husband Bill is hosting events in Ohio. Joe Biden will speak at a rally in Philadelphia.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:10:06.729Z\">at 2.10pm BST</time></p>  </div>"
