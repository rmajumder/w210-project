  "<p>A proposed law banning asylum seekers in offshore detention on Manus Island and Nauru from coming to Australia would prepare for a resettlement deal with a third country to clear the camps, Peter Dutton has suggested.</p> <p>The immigration minister told ABC radio on Monday that ministerial discretion could prevent families being separated by the policy, or that Australia could help families move elsewhere to encourage refugees to accept resettlement in third countries.</p> <p>He said the law, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/30/asylum-seekers-face-lifetime-ban-on-entering-australia-if-they-arrive-by-boat\">announced on Sunday</a>, was designed to put into action the principle that \u201cpeople who seek to come by boat won\u2019t be settling in Australia\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are keen to get people off to third countries if they can\u2019t return to their country of origin,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working with a number of countries now.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is if somebody is to go to a third country that they apply for a tourist visa or some other way to circumvent what the government\u2019s policy is by coming back to Australia from that third country.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\">

and children off Nauru is 'first priority'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dutton said the policy was consistent with Labor\u2019s policy that people who arrived by boat would not settle in Australia, though it goes much further in banning visits to Australia on any type of visa after resettlement elsewhere.</p> <p>Asked about earlier comments that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/peter-dutton-open-to-refugees-on-nauru-being-resettled-in-new-zealand\">at first indicated the government was open to a deal with New Zealand</a>, then <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/asylum-seeker-processing-at-nauru-will-continue-for-decades-says-dutton\">appeared to rule it out</a>, Dutton said: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve said is ... that the deal structured by the Gillard government was essentially a backdoor way to get to Australia.\u201d</p> <p>He said <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/21/australia-will-take-refugees-from-costa-rica-camps-turnbull-tells-un\">a plan for Australia to take refugees from camps in Costa Rica</a> was not linked to \u201csome other deal\u201d, denying that it was the first plank of a deal to have refugees in offshore detention accepted by the United States.</p> <p>On ABC Radio the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, confirmed that the US was \u201cone of a number of countries that take resettlement\u201d but she was \u201cnot in a position to confirm or deny\u201d whether it was one of the countries Australia could ask to take refugees.</p> <p>Asked if taking refugees from Costa Rica was part of a deal to resettle refugees from Manus Island and Nauru, Bishop said: \u201cthat is not my understanding \u2013 that is not my understanding at all.\u201d</p> <p>Asked how the policy would affect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/18/australian-woman-with-family-on-nauru-pleads-for-end-to-offshore-detention\">refugees and asylum seekers with families in Australia</a>, Dutton said: \u201cThere is a ministerial discretion to act in the public interest.</p> <p>\u201cSo there may be individual cases around families, for example, where the minister of the day can provide a migration outcome, so that person can be allowed in.\u201d</p> <p>Dutton said: \u201cWhere there are family units that are separated we will look at those circumstances and if it\u2019s possible and we have a third-country option available to those families, we will talk to them about that option.\u201d</p> <p>He noted that the policy did not apply to children who were under 18 when they went into offshore detention.</p> <p>Dutton said he was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d the law was both constitutional and consistent with international law, citing legal advice from the international division of the Attorney General\u2019s Department, the Australian government solicitor and counsel in the immigration department.</p> <p>Both Labor and Nick Xenophon have said they need to see the detail of the government\u2019s proposal before deciding whether to support it.</p> <p>The deputy opposition leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tanya-plibersek\">Tanya Plibersek</a>, has said the proposal is \u201ca distraction from Peter Dutton\u2019s hopeless mismanagement of his portfolio\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is extraordinary that, three years on, the government has not found third countries to resettle those people who are in limbo on Manus Island and Nauru.\u201d</p> <p>The Greens criticised the announcement, saying the Turnbull government had \u201csunk to a new low\u201d in its \u201clatest attempt to punish innocent people seeking asylum\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related:

Team LH are firmly of the belief that Hamilton will do just that. And to whet the appetite for the following 70 laps, there\u2019s a cool 890m sprint into that first turn. \u201cIt\u2019s a long run to Turn 1, we\u2019ll just have to see,\u201d said Verstappen on Saturday.

By reaching for orange juice after winning the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2016/may/29/indianapolis-500-a-look-back-at-a-centurey-of-races-in-pictures\">Indy 500</a> in 1993 the Brazilian might have provoked rancour but he was always a singular driver and a singular character and he has no time, nor patience, for regrets after a remarkable career. Being himself was always more important to Fittipaldi and it is something he shares with and admires in Lewis Hamilton.</em></p> <p><em>The winner drinking milk after the race at Indianapolis is one of motor sport\u2019s oldest traditions, begun in 1933 after Louis Meyer celebrated his second victory with a glass. But Fittipaldi wanted to do his own thing (and doubtless help the business of the orange grove farm he owned) after taking the flag for the second of his two wins at the Brickyard. He duly swigged orange juice and was still being booed years later when driving the pace car before the opening of the 2008 race. Mentioning it now provokes gentle amusement.</em></p> <p><em>\u201cI was promoting the Brazilian orange juice,\u201d he says. \u201cI won the race and I did drink the milk, but it was after I drank the orange.

Realising we needed to create more of an income, we turned our thoughts to cider. Ivor\u2019s persistent research led to the discovery and purchase, for \u00a3100, of an abandoned hydraulic apple press, unmoved since 1940.</p> <p>We set about planting cider apple and perry pear varieties on strictly organic principles. Dunkertons was the first cider company whose total cider and perry production was to <a href=\"https://www.soilassociation.org\">Soil Association</a> standards. By the early 2000s <a href=\"https://www.dunkertonscider.co.uk/?v=79cba1185463\">Dunkertons</a> was producing an average of 40,000 gallons of cider a year, and Ivor spurred us on to win many Camra awards.</p> <p>In 2001 he was diagnosed with myeloma but only three years ago did his health start to deteriorate seriously. The company was sold to Julian.</p> <p>Ivor is survived by Martin, Julian and me, and two granddaughters.</p>",

  "<p>When I was a child in Lahore in Pakistan, my parents employed a&#xa0;driver called Sultan. Sultan, a retired soldier, was from a village near Jhelum. He was a cheerful man in his 60s who readily joined in our games of&#xa0;badminton. But to me the most interesting fact about Sultan was that he could speak Italian. A&#xa0;fragmentary, broken Italian, but Italian nonetheless, picked up as a prisoner of war in Italy. He called me <em>signorina</em> and taught me three Italian words: <em>si</em>, <em>grazie</em> and <em>buongiorno</em>. Decades later, when I told my children about Sultan, they were gobsmacked. What was a Pakistani villager doing fighting in Italy? He wasn\u2019t Pakistani then, I&#xa0;explained, he was Indian. Sultan was one of more than two million Indian soldiers who fought for the allies in the second world war. \u201cNo! Really?\u201d they breathed.</p> <p>My children (daughter 17, son 15) were born and raised in London and have had the good fortune to attend fantastic schools where they have been offered, alongside the usual array of subjects, a rich diet of music, drama, art, sport and languages. Their extracurricular clubs include Arabic, feminism, astronomy, mindfulness and carpentry. In my convent school in Lahore, I had to listen in&#xa0;respectful silence. In London, they are encouraged to question and argue.</p> <p>Yet, for all the range and candour of their education, they haven\u2019t once encountered Britain\u2019s colonial past in school. My daughter is now in her second year of A-levels. She has studied history from the age of nine, but the closest she has come&#xa0;to any mention of empire was in her GCSE syllabus that included the run-up to the second world war. While studying the Treaty of Versailles, she learned that some countries had colonies at the time and, as part of Germany\u2019s punishment, it was stripped of its colonial possessions. Period.</p> <p>Though she read about the brutal battles in the&#xa0;Pacific and North Africa, no mention was made of the 2.5 million Indian soldiers who volunteered to fight in the second world war \u2013 or the 1.3 million who served in 1914-18. There was nothing about the 87,000 jawans killed in 1939-45. She&#xa0;had no notion of the massive contribution India \u2013 and Britain\u2019s other colonies \u2013 made to the war effort. Hence her astonishment at Sultan\u2019s Italian connection.</p> <p>Of course, my kids know that their grandparents, along with the citizens of almost half the globe, were once British subjects. But they have acquired this knowledge at home, not at school. Aged 11, my son learned in a geography class that one of the many reasons Ghana (the Gold Coast to its 19th-century British rulers) was economically less developed was because of its colonial past. It had been stripped of its wealth by the British. Just one bland sentence. Now, in secondary school, he is currently reading a past Booker winner, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/white-tiger.html\" title=\"\">The White Tiger</a> by Aravind Adiga. For half-term, his English teacher has asked him to read another novel about India. The list she has&#xa0;given him includes Rudyard Kipling\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/kim-11.html\" title=\"\">Kim</a>, EM Forster\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/passage-to-india-3.html\" title=\"\">A&#xa0;Passage to India</a> and Salman Rushdie\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/midnight-s-children-5.html\" title=\"\">Midnight\u2019s Children</a>. I imagine some mention of&#xa0;colonialism will be made when discussing those texts.</p> <p>But even this is off-piste learning, the initiative of an individual teacher; it is not part of the curriculum. Last year, my daughter, who is studying history of art at A-level, was taken to see Tate Britain\u2019s exhibition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/23/artist-and-empire-review-tate-britain\" title=\"\">Art and Empire</a>. Her teacher thought it important for the paper on orientalism and, something of a political activist in her youth, gave them an impassioned lecture on Britain\u2019s imperial past. But the historical context was not obligatory in the curriculum. Students were required to restrict themselves to a technical visual analysis of the paintings they studied, not explore the political background that produced them.</p> <p>Dr Mukulika Banerjee, director of the <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/southAsia/Home.aspx\" title=\"\">South Asia Centre</a> and associate professor of anthropology at the London School of Economics, talks of British students who \u201carrive at university completely ignorant about the empire, that vital part of their history. When we talk of Syria today, they have no knowledge of Britain\u2019s role in the Middle East in the last century. When discussing burning political questions today, they have no historical context to &#xa0;draw on that links Britain\u2019s own past with those events. Similarly, they have no clue about the history of the immigration. They don\u2019t understand why people of other ethnicities came to Britain in the first place. They haven\u2019t learned any of it at school. So, in their second year at university, when my students discover the extent of their ignorance, they are furious.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t know whether this amnesia is due to embarrassment or fear of reparations or, indeed, a&#xa0;sinister desire to keep the electorate ignorant and pliable. Whatever the original rationale, the ugly xenophobia unleashed since the EU referendum has brought home the urgent need to reform history textbooks and address this abyss at their heart. Without it, they are distorted, dishonest. I used to laugh when British people asked me where I&#xa0;had learned my English. (Despite 20&#xa0;years in&#xa0;this country, I still have a strong Pakistani accent.) Post-Brexit, I am not amused. And it\u2019s no good pretending that the history of Malaysia, Nigeria, India or Kenya is world history and therefore not relevant to the modern British curriculum. It is British history. To quote Kipling, that controversial yet compelling poet of empire: \u201cWhat should they know of England who only England know?\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Valerie Hunter Gordon, who has died aged 94, designed the world\u2019s first disposable nappy, initially in 1947 using nylon from old wartime parachutes. Awaiting the birth of her third child, she dreaded what she called the \u201cawful labour\u201d of washing, drying and ironing cloth nappies. Surprised there was no alternative, she determined to invent one. The result was a two-part system, the Paddi: an adjustable waterproof outer garment holding a discardable, biodegradable pad, made of cellulose wadding covered over with cotton wool. She received a patent for the invention in October 1949.</p> <p>The first 400 she made at her kitchen table with a Singer sewing machine, selling them to friends for five shillings apiece. Boots began to sell her nappies in all their branches in 1950, after a Lancet article argued disposable nappies helped reduce baby rashes. Seventy-two thousand of them sold in 1950, then, in 1951, 250,000. By 1960, the number was 6m. The American company Procter &amp; Gamble began producing the all-in-one Pampers from 1961, which, though not biodegradable, were cheaper. The Paddi entered a slow decline in sales, the last rolling of the assembly line in 1990.</p> <p>Hunter Gordon\u2019s subsequent inventions included the Nikini, one of the first modern sanitary towels, in 1954, and a house which she continually redesigned to spare household labour. Rather than ironing, she pressed shirts by placing them under the carpet. Tiring of polishing her family\u2019s mahogany table, she made a plastic top, saying \u201cif anybody important comes to stay, we\u2019ll take it off\u201d. It never came off, including during a visit to her house by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a>. Hunter Gordon\u2019s drawing room became a laboratory of invention, with her children Nigel and Frances often roped in to serve as models.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7d50d26b1f047dcfb566ea6edacf31fb29e904ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d50d26b1f047dcfb566ea6edacf31fb29e904ce/103_0_973_1216/800.jpg\" alt=\"Boots began to sell Valerie Hunter Gordon\u2019s nappies in all their branches in 1950\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boots began to sell Valerie Hunter Gordon\u2019s nappies in all their branches in 1950</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Daughter of Sir Vincent Ziani de Ferranti, and his wife, Dorothy (nee Wilson), she was born in the Peak District, in the small Derbyshire village of Baslow, into a family of inventors. Her grandfather, Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, was an Italian-Liverpudlian electrical engineer. Being one of the few experts on alternating-current electricity in Britain, in 1891 he designed the world\u2019s first modern power station, at Deptford, south-east London. Valerie\u2019s father oversaw the expansion of the family business, Ferranti, into a major manufacturer of radios and televisions, involved too in defence electronics and early postwar computing.</p> <p>Valerie was frequently in and out of her grandfather\u2019s house, living nearby until his death in 1930. He worked often at home, and was fond of sharing with his granddaughter how his inventions worked, and his vision of the use of technology and innovation to improve daily lives. \u201cI suspect that is where she learned if you have a need, and it\u2019s not fulfilled, then maybe you could do something about it yourself,\u201d said her son Nigel. \u201cI know that he loved to tell her about all the things he was doing, and she loved to listen to it.\u201d</p> <p>She attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart school, in Roehampton, south-west London, run by a French teaching order of nuns. (After the second world war, the school relocated to the Surrey village of Woldingham, and presently exists as <a href=\"http://www.woldinghamschool.co.uk\" title=\"\">Woldingham school</a>.) In 1940, she married a Scottish major and electrical engineer, Patrick Hunter Gordon. Both her father and husband were involved in the retreat from Dunkirk \u2013 her father leading a group home to safety on discarded motorbikes, by way of the Spanish border, arriving home just in time for their wedding.</p> <p>When Patrick left the army in 1950, the family moved to Beauly, 10 miles west of Inverness. He took over a family business, AI Welders and Cable Belts. He suffered from post-traumatic illness, in which she was a constant support; he, in turn, requisitioned surplus parachute nylon for her experiments, helped her test early designs with families of army colleagues, and encouraged her to bring forward the product commercially.</p> <p>Her father also was an unflagging supporter. Hunter Gordon wrote to the nappy-makers Robinsons of Chesterfield, who initially were sceptical due to a failed related experiment in the 1930s. At a Royal Society dinner, her father then found himself seated beside the company\u2019s chairman, Sir Robert Robinson \u2013 which resulted in her getting a second hearing and an invitation to Chesterfield. She convinced the company to produce them in bulk, paying her royalties, starting in late 1949.</p> <p>Those familiar with Hunter Gordon describe her as pragmatic and insightful, with a wicked sense of humour and ability to see straight to the nub of a subject. Supremely confident in her own judgment, she was nonetheless personally modest and self-effacing. She said later if she had known the amount of work involved in seeing her invention through, she \u201cwould have gone on washing the damned things\u201d.</p> <p>Patrick died in a car accident in 1978. She is survived by their six children, Hugh, Alison, Nigel \u2013 the inspiration and model for the original disposable nappy \u2013 Frances, Richard and Kit, 19 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Valerie Hunter Gordon, inventor, born 7 December 1921; died 16 October 2016</p>",
  "<p>As Marco Rubio and Patrick Murphy squared off in the final debate of their Florida Senate race, the discussion turned to the Syrian civil war. Rubio, a former presidential candidate and member of the Senate intelligence committee, challenged his rival\u2019s understanding of the factions on the ground. Murphy, a two-term congressman, reverted to a familiar line.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/donald-trump-voters-rally-election-crowd\">Inside a Donald Trump rally: good people in a feedback loop of paranoia and hate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt just goes back to the same point,\u201d he said, \u201cthat Senator Rubio continues to support Donald Trump, and it is shameful that he stands there with him.\u201d</p> <p>The audience laughed, faintly, at one of nearly 20 mentions of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/donald-trump-voters-rally-election-crowd\">the Republican presidential nominee</a> during the one-hour debate. When Murphy next mentioned Trump, Rubio was quick with a rejoinder based on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DteDRD6cbbM\">a famous Joe Biden rebuke of Rudy Giuliani</a>: \u201cA noun, a verb and Donald Trump: that\u2019s his answer to everything.\u201d</p> <p>The race in Florida, among the most closely watched in the country, could help determine whether Republicans keep control of the Senate. Democrats see the vote as a referendum on Trump. But Murphy\u2019s mentions of the businessman underscored the potential limitations of using the top of the ticket to mount attacks down the ballot.</p> <p>Murphy has questioned how Rubio can endorse Trump, whom Rubio has called \u201ca con man\u201d, untrustworthy with the nuclear codes, and \u201cthe most vulgar person ever to aspire to the presidency\u201d. In recent weeks, polls have given the Democrat hope, in part because Trump is trailing Hillary Clinton in Florida by around three points. But with nine days left before Election Day, Rubio is about seven points up on Trump in the state.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Less than ideal choices\u2019</strong></h2> <p>This week, both candidates spoke to the Guardian. \u201cI\u2019ve said all along that these are less than ideal choices before us,\u201d Rubio said, \u201cand that\u2019s why we need a senator willing to stand up to the next president no matter who it is \u2013 even if it\u2019s from your own party.\u201d</p> <p>Rubio was speaking on the day the FBI director, James Comey, said the agency was reviewing emails that might be pertinent to the closed investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private server while secretary of state. </p> <p>\u201cThe question now is will Patrick Murphy still 100% trust Hillary Clinton, as he has said in the past,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Murphy, who spoke earlier in the week after appearing with Clinton at a rally in Coconut Creek, said there was no comparison between the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful that Senator Rubio\u2019s connecting me to Secretary Clinton,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cYou look at what she\u2019s been fighting for her entire life, and you contrast that to Donald Trump. You talk about a contrast of both qualifications and temperament for who our next world leader is going to be.\u201d</p> <p>Citing Trump\u2019s litany of inflammatory comments \u2013 against immigrants, Muslims, women, the Gold Star parents of an Iraq war hero, prisoners of war and more \u2013 Murphy said it was \u201cappalling to a lot of Floridians that Marco Rubio continues to stand by Donald Trump\u2019s side\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people had the courage to stand up to Donald Trump,\u201d he added, noting the flurry of Republicans who withdrew their support earlier this month after a video was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/john-mccain-donald-trump-sex-boast-tape\">unearthed from 2005</a> in which the former reality TV star bragged about groping and kissing women without consent.</p> <p>Rubio, despite condemning Trump\u2019s comments, was not among them. He has kept Trump at a distance, however, making no campaign appearances with the nominee despite his frequent presence in Florida.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"281fee7cc4c65d703cf356526fa3bcb4b81df19d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/281fee7cc4c65d703cf356526fa3bcb4b81df19d/90_137_2285_2855/800.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton campaigns with Patrick Murphy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton campaigns with Patrick Murphy in Coconut Creek.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Marano/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rubio\u2019s rationale rests primarily in the balance of the supreme court, where the vacancy left by Antonin Scalia remains. In the primary, Rubio doubted whether Trump would nominate a conservative. He told the Guardian a list of potential appointees released by Trump was \u201cencouraging\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see who wins the election and whether he\u2019ll actually do that,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cBut they\u2019ll be held to the same standard, whether it\u2019s a Republican president or a Democrat president \u2026 I\u2019m looking for people that will apply the constitution according to the original intent of the words of the constitution.\u201d</p> <p>Rubio also expressed confidence that he would be judged on his own record. Saying his opponent lacked any legislative accomplishments despite having served in Congress for four years, Rubio touted his own work on issues such as human trafficking, sanctions against Venezuela and Hezbollah, and veterans affairs.</p> <p>Asked if he would be willing to work with Clinton, he stopped short of naming potential areas of agreement. \u201cI have a record of working with people across the aisle, and I\u2019ll work with anyone if they\u2019re pursuing ideas that I think are good for America,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Murphy, whose time in Congress has been been spent in the minority, denied he had little to show. He listed funding for the Everglades, preventing cuts to a key component of Medicare, and securing lower flood insurance rates, and stated his commitment to issues such as climate change, equal pay and raising the minimum wage.</p> <p>He has nonetheless struggled with a lack of name recognition, compounded by limited resources after national Democratic groups withdrew millions of dollars in reserved ad spending. </p> <p>The decision has drawn criticism from some observers, for its apparent abandonment of a race many believe is winnable. Others complain of a missed opportunity to deliver a fatal blow to Rubio, whom many believe will make another run for the presidency, potentially challenging Clinton in 2020. </p> <p>But some involved in Democrats\u2019 efforts to retake the Senate defended their move, citing Florida\u2019s expensive media markets in comparison to battlegrounds such as Indiana, Missouri, and North Carolina, where money can prove more influential. </p> <p>\u201cI do think the threat of him running for president in 2020 is real,\u201d a Senate Democratic strategist said of Rubio. \u201cBut our goal is to take back the Senate and win the White House right now. We\u2019re not running a campaign for 2020.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>\u2018The height of cynicism\u2019</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21b31afa73452caf397e45eeb3e7899bb63f540e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21b31afa73452caf397e45eeb3e7899bb63f540e/0_353_3408_2045/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rubio and Murphy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rubio and Murphy meet to debate at Broward College in Davie, earlier this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wilfredo Lee/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another Democratic strategist familiar with the Florida Senate race said internal polling conducted by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Clinton campaign showed Murphy trailing Rubio by high single digits. On Thursday, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/senate-update-rubio-is-keeping-the-republicans-hopes-alive-in-the-senate\">FiveThirtyEight</a> gave Rubio an 81% chance of defeating Murphy, finding the sitting senator ahead in 48 of 50 public polls. On Sunday, two new polls showed Rubio up by eight and nine points.</p> <p>Pressure to reinvest in the race did pay some dividends last week, when a Super Pac affiliated with Senate minority leader Harry Reid confirmed it was transferring a seven-figure sum to a pro-Murphy super pac in Florida. Nonetheless, Murphy has largely had to rely on earned media coverage and high-profile surrogates.</p> <p>Among the most vocal has been Barack Obama, who called Rubio\u2019s support for Trump \u201cthe height of cynicism\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cHow can you call him a \u2018con artist\u2019 and \u2018dangerous\u2019 and object to all the controversial things he says and then say, \u2018But I\u2019m still gonna vote for him?\u2019 C\u2019mon, man!\u201d Obama said at a campaign stop in Miami Gardens.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the sign of somebody who will say anything, do anything, pretend to be anybody, just to get elected. And you know what? If you\u2019re willing to be anybody just to be somebody, then you don\u2019t have the leadership that Florida needs in the United States Senate.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton has also urged voters to back Murphy and made a familiar connection: \u201cUnlike his opponent, Patrick Murphy has not been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump and his dangerous, divisive campaign.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/donald-trump-tony-schwartz-art-of-the-deal-out-of-control\">Donald Trump's ghostwriter on being the 'Dr Frankenstein' who made a monster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such high-profile support, however, may prove too little, too late. For one thing, Rubio has a solid base of support among Hispanic voters, many of whom identify with the Spanish-speaking son of Cuban immigrants and in 2012 accounted for 17% of Florida\u2019s electorate. </p> <p>Murphy ramped up his outreach to the Hispanic community \u2013 somewhat belatedly, some say. In doing so, he sought to revive Rubio\u2019s involvement in a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013, noting that the senator backed away from the issue when faced with backlash from conservatives.</p> <p>It has been an uphill battle. In Miami\u2019s Little Havana recently, at one of Clinton\u2019s 81 Florida field offices, volunteers labored to get out the vote. Dozens of voters, mostly Latino, entered and left the building.</p> <p>Among them were Azalia and Lucia Rodriguez. Originally from Nicaragua, they were motivated in part by resentment of Trump and said they would vote for Clinton. They did not support Rubio, they said. But they also did not plan to vote for Murphy. </p> <p>Their reason? They hadn\u2019t heard of him.</p>",

They used this toy because they know the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/kurdish-forces-mosul-peshmerga-troops-isis-iraq-fighting-every-yard\">peshmerga</a> [Kurdish fighters] will not touch it, but children will,\u201d said Colonel Nawzad Kamil Hassan, an engineer with the Kurdish forces, who says his unit has cleared more than 50 tonnes of explosives from areas once controlled by the militants.</p> <p>As a broad coalition of forces tries to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iraq-isis-conflict-latest-us-coalition-retake-mosul-a7364976.html\">push Isis out of Mosul</a>, its last major stronghold in Iraq, Hassan has decided to preserve some of the most creative, cruel and unusual of those homemade bombs to use as training aids for new recruits to one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. The homemade explosive devices provide a lesson in the depths of ingenuity, intelligence and resources that Isis devotes to spreading murder and fear even when its fighters can no longer terrorise in person.</p> <p>In the areas where it rules for long enough to seed them with bombs, the group has created a dark, parallel universe, where even the most mundane object can kill. A toy, a playing card and an abandoned watch are all detonators designed to spark the acquisitive curiosity of a returning civilian, who would be maimed or murdered by the explosion.</p> <p>An ordinary hose lying across a road is another simple but ingenious detonator. A bundle of old clothes, which a dog or cat could step across without harm, would have exploded if someone had picked it up to reclaim or throw away. A pile of mud and stones is a concealed mortar. A discarded piece of plywood would have activated a bomb when it was picked up or kicked aside, as a ball bearing rolled down a tube to complete the circuit. Duct tape, a lever and a trip wire turn a door into a deadly weapon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73271b483a7875b2a9f5b31bbc9085cc05938917\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73271b483a7875b2a9f5b31bbc9085cc05938917/0_131_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Even a simple playing card is used by Isil to attract someone to an anti-personal device\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Even a simple playing card is used by Isil to attract someone to an anti-personal device</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandro Rota/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The expertise of Isis with explosives and extensive use of suicide bombs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/booby-traps-and-soaking-chickpeas-inside-an-abandoned-isis-tunnel\">booby traps</a> makes attacking them particularly dangerous, and slows recovery when they are defeated. Because there is no area, civilian or military, that the group will not lace with explosives, many Iraqis fear that returning to their homes and former lives could be deadly, even long after militants have left.</p> <p>In Sinjar city, a centre for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/oct/27/yazidi-women-who-escaped-isis-win-sakharov-prize-human-rights-nadia-murad-lamiya-aji-ashar\">Yazidi minority</a> who have been victims of some of Isis\u2019s worst atrocities, Hassan\u2019s men cleared five tonnes of explosives from a single school, he says. His engineers\u2019 unit, 1st Support Force Command, has been working through areas to the west of Mosul city for around two years.</p> <p>They must second-guess every pile of stones or rubble, every door and window, every apparently discarded or abandoned object, on guard against their own complacency as much as the bombs themselves.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day there is a new device. Some of our men have disposed of things that others have not even seen before,\u201d he says. His men have little protective equipment. Two have been killed and 15 injured. The training school, set up by Hassan\u2019s unit with help from the French military, is an attempt to limit that toll, both by teaching recruits to recognise and defuse Isis bombs, and by giving them a sense of the capacities of the forces they will fight.</p> <p>Their war is often a shadowy battle of wits, as they try to find and defuse devices planted weeks, even months, earlier. But the engineers also provide mine-clearance for advancing troops, when they sometimes face Isis and its bomb-makers in close contact.</p> <p>At the entrance to the first room in Hassan\u2019s school, there are two of those \u201cfighters\u201d waiting in suicide vests and explosive backpacks. They provide a moment of visceral shock. In fact, they are only shop mannequins, but the bombs they wear are real, taken from injured fighters. The balaclava covering one plastic face makes it less obviously incongruous, more disturbingly realistic. Beside them hangs an Isis flag, seized in a cleared area, and a glass frame with rows of detonators and rockets improvised from gas canisters and barrels.</p> <p>Then the rows of different bombs begin: there are the cleverly camouflaged ones, intended to take out a single victim, then others designed to maim and kill more widely. Some are designed for active combat and must be detonated by a fighter close by, such as the trio of radio-controlled pressure cooker bombs that could be used in sequence, first to maim a group of attackers, then to take out their rescuers. \u201cThey are set up with a view to secondary explosions,\u201d Hassan explains. Others are controlled by mobile phones or wires.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They are not even animals, they are worse than animals</p> <footer> <cite>Colonel Nawzad Kamil Hassan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the majority of the bombs are created to lie in wait for their victims. The most frequently used pressure-plate IEDs (improvised explosive devices) are so common that hundreds are dumped in a pile at the entrance to the classrooms. To an untrained eye, thin and wrapped in a tangle of wires, they look like the discarded fittings for strip lighting. Others are formed from pressure cookers and ball bearings, fibreboard and bedsprings, jugs of explosives and trip wires. The threat is in open spaces as well as in buildings and on roads.</p> <p>Wires, painted green and arranged through grass, would have detonated at a single touch. The mortars, smeared with mud and pebbled with fake stones, had been placed on a dusty, windy plain where nature would conspire to hide them further. A few of the devices target the engineers themselves, who are a particular enemy for Isis because of their work to spearhead ground operations and undo its deadly traps in liberated areas.</p> <p>Hassan points to a small, easily detectable mine that is actually a booby trap for a well-buried pressure-plate IED. \u201cSo when he goes in to defuse this, he will step on the other and it will explode,\u201d he explains.</p> <p>The collection grows with almost every mission, and Hassan fears it will not stop expanding until Isis is deprived of the space and resources to think up new ways of delivering death.</p> <p>\u201cThey are not even animals,\u201d he says, picking up the deactivated teddy bear in disgust. \u201cThey are worse than animals.\u201d</p>",

A marvellous miscellany of more recent work, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/confabulations.html\"><em>Confabulations</em></a>, has just been published by Penguin, and <a href=\"https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/a-jar-of-wild-flowers/forthcoming/\"><em>A Jar of Wild Flowers: Essays in Celebration of John Berger</em></a><em> </em>(including tributes from Ali Smith, Sally Potter and Julie Christie) is coming soon from Zed books.</p> <p>The homage continues on film in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/16/the-seasons-in-quincy-four-portraits-of-john-berger-review-tilda-swinton-berlin-2016\"><em>The Seasons in Quincy: Four Portraits of John Berger</em></a>, shot during his late 80s \u2013 a collage of informal conversation and political discussion, with offerings by Tilda Swinton, the writer and producer Colin MacCabe and others. It was shot in the hamlet in Haute-Savoie, in the French Alps, where Berger lived for more than 40 years. These jostling admirers show not only that the man is greatly loved, but an intellectual indebtedness behind the wish to say thank you. Critic, novelist, poet, dramatist, artist, commentator \u2013 and, above all, storyteller \u2013 Berger was described by Susan Sontag as peerless in his ability to make \u201cattentiveness to the sensual world\u201d meet \u201cimperatives of conscience\u201d. His book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/ways-of-seeing.html\"><em>Ways of Seeing</em></a>, and the 1972 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00dtnvm\">BBC television series</a> based on it, changed the way at least two generations responded to art. And his writing since then \u2013 especially about migration \u2013 has changed the way many of us see the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Berger still has the ability to give himself the slip, to turn perception into an out-of-body experience</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Berger now lives in Antony, a suburb seven miles outside Paris, where he stays with his old friend Nella Bielski, an actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/24/fiction.features1\">and writer</a> who grew up in the Soviet Union. They open the door together, and as we sit down to lunch, she turns to me and says: \u201cThe thing you have to understand about John is that he is not interested in talking about himself.\u201d While the chorus of approval gets louder on this side of the Channel, he is, unlikely as this might sound, barely aware of any fuss brewing. When I produce a proof of <em>A Jar of Wild Flowers</em>, he turns it over in his hands in delighted surprise. \u201cThat is a drawing by Melina,\u201d he exclaims, surveying the flowers with spindly stems on the cover, \u201cmy granddaughter.\u201d He gets up from the table and returns with an oil portrait, the size of a sheet of A4 paper. It is of an ageless face and yet Melina is only 13. (Berger has three children \u2013 Katya, Jacob and Yves \u2013 and five grandchildren.) He props it next to us and we look at her, as if she had joined us for lunch. \u201cIf you ask me who I am,\u201d Berger says, \u201cI\u2019d like to see myself through her eyes, in the way she looks at me.\u201d Her stare is disconcertingly level. She looks, we agree, as if she knows more than she could possibly know or have seen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cfafe60d160d6d1036e42899acf9b72b7c067218\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfafe60d160d6d1036e42899acf9b72b7c067218/0_0_2448_3264/750.jpg\" alt=\"The painting of Berger's granddaughter, Melina, 13, by Jules Linglin\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The painting of his granddaughter, Melina, 13, by Jules Linglin, of which Berger says: \u2018If you ask me who I am, I\u2019d like to see myself through her eyes.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jules Linglin/Kate Kellaway</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are two things that are wonderful about this moment. The first is the reminder that Berger is as interested as ever in ways of seeing; that he still has the ability to give himself the slip, to turn perception into an out-of-body experience. And second, it is characteristic that he is keen to champion the young artist who painted his granddaughter. \u201cFetch me a piece of card from that side table,\u201d he says. He writes in his not-quite-steady, attractively looping hand: Jules Linglin. \u201cHe is going to be very well known one day,\u201d he declares, handing the card back to me.</p> <p>In spite of his wish to be seen through his granddaughter\u2019s eyes, it is Berger himself I now observe. He is smallish, but his face is big \u2013 handsomely hewn, with blue eyes and thick white hair. I have recently watched <em>Ways of Seeing</em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pDE4VX_9Kk\">on YouTube</a>, and it is extraordinary how commanding the four episodes still are. Berger had no time for ivory towers \u2013 his way of seeing was radical. Forty-four years ago he was a charismatic presence, looking into the camera with piercing eyes and a frequent frown, as if constantly on the edge of disagreeing with himself. The look was fitting because what the series did was to make people rethink. He never ducked difficulty: he described, for instance, how women, in traditional painting, were there to \u201cfeed an appetite, not to have any of their own\u201d. Unlike Kenneth Clark\u2019s patrician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/19/kenneth-clark-civilisation-bbc-review\"><em>Civilisation</em></a><em> </em>(1969), <em>Ways of Seeing</em> was never overbearing. In each episode, Berger sports the same groovy shirt with a geometric brown design on a cream background. His voice is clear and emphatic and fudges its Rs. His final words in the series are: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve shown, and what I\u2019ve said\u2026 must be judged against your own experience.\u201d That is what everything he has written asks us to do.</p> <p>For me, Berger will always be the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/to-the-wedding.html\"><em>To the Wedding</em></a> \u2013 a moving, unexpectedly affirmative novel about Aids, in which truth pursued fiction because he discovered only after he had started writing it that his daughter-in-law was HIV-positive. When I was a Booker judge in 1995, it was, out of 141 contenders, the novel I most wanted to win \u2013 although it possibly made for a quieter life that it didn\u2019t. Berger famously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/jan/09/lookingbackatthebookerjoh\">gave away half his Booker prize money</a> to the Black Panthers in 1972, when <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/g.html\"><em>G</em></a>, his postmodern novel about an Italian philanderer\u2019s political coming-of-age, secured the prize. A lifelong Marxist (although never a member of the Communist party), he disapproved of Booker McConnell\u2019s historical association with indentured labour in the Caribbean. The other half of the money went to funding Berger\u2019s book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/seventh-man.html\"><em>A Seventh Man</em></a>, with the photographer <a href=\"http://www.jeanmohr.ch/image/oeuvre\">Jean Mohr</a>, about European migrant workers \u2013 a work he has since said is the one he would most like to survive him. Apparently, one of the Black Panthers went with him to the Booker ceremony and repeatedly advised him to \u201ckeep it cool\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I'm like the lookout guy on a boat who does small jobs, such as shovelling stuff into a boiler, but I\u2019m no navigator</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And now Berger is looking at my proof copy of <em>Confabulations</em> \u2013 a miscellany of his essays and drawings (he went to the Chelsea School of Art as a young man, studying under Henry Moore, and taught there before being hired as the <em>New Statesman</em>\u2019s art critic). We consider his lively sketch of half a dozen topsy-turvy mushrooms. Underneath, in his hand, is written: \u201cSee you later, Omelette\u2026\u201d People forget that Berger is funny. And curious. And that he listens \u2013 how he listens. Over lunch, the small talk is of artichokes and an incredible Georgian dish involving walnuts, but this then leads Nella to talk about Berger\u2019s American wife, Beverly Bancroft (mother of Yves; the older children are from an earlier marriage), who died in 2013, and of her artistry as a gardener. This makes me think of the most moving scene in <em>The Seasons in Quincy</em>, in which Berger urges Tilda Swinton\u2019s teenage twins to pick raspberries because Beverly loved them. Berger suggests the twins gather photos of Beverly \u2013 and they go ahead and make a sort of homemade shrine and eat bowlfuls of raspberries alongside it. \u201cYour pleasure will give her pleasure,\u201d Berger tells them. Towards the end of lunch, Nella whispers to me, in an aside, that she has nicknamed her Parisian house \u201cHotel Spinoza\u201d \u2013 after Berger\u2019s favourite 17th-century philosopher. His book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bento-s-sketchbook-268205.html\"><em>Bento\u2019s Sketchbook</em></a> (2011) was inspired by Spinoza, whose day job was as a lens grinder. Like his hero, Berger prefers not to distinguish between the physical and spiritual. Spinoza\u2019s vision, he now tells me, is that \u201call is indivisible\u201d.</p> <p>After lunch we move into his study, a den of paintings, a place of light, its windows thrown wide, looking on to trees. He tries to make himself comfortable on the white sofa, an arthritic back giving him trouble. As a writer, Berger has that rare and wonderful gift of being able to make complex thoughts simple. He once said, in a BBC interview with Jeremy Isaacs, that he likes, in all his work, to follow the advice of the photographer <a href=\"https://pro.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MAGO31_10_VForm&amp;ERID=24KL535353\">Robert Capa</a>: \u201cWhen the picture is not good enough, go closer\u2026\u201d His eye for detail remains unrivalled and consistently surprising (think of his irresistible observation that cows walk as if they were wearing high heels). Reading him is like standing at a window \u2013 perhaps a bit like the window of this study \u2013 with no one blocking the view. \u201cThe way I observe comes naturally to me as a curious person \u2013 I\u2019m like <em>la vigie</em> \u2013 the lookout guy on a boat who does small jobs, maybe such as shovelling stuff into a boiler, but I\u2019m no navigator \u2013 absolutely the opposite. I wander around the boat, find odd places \u2013 the masts, the gunwale \u2013 and then simply look out at the ocean. Being aware of travelling has nothing to do with being a navigator.\u201d</p> <p>Berger was born in Stoke Newington, north London. His father, Stanley, was a Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who came from Trieste via Liverpool to London and was much affected by the first world war, in which he served as an infantry officer and was awarded the Military Cross. He loved painting and was self-taught (paternal conscience led him, when he found John reading Joyce\u2019s <em>Ulysses</em>, to confiscate the book, along with five others, and lock them up in his safe). In Colin MacCabe\u2019s film for <em>The Seasons in Quincy</em>, Berger instructs Tilda Swinton (a friend for more than 20 years) on how to quarter and peel apples in the way his father used to do, and affectionately remembers how his father wanted him to be a lawyer, a doctor, an English gentleman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f3b160689d23db595ce781fc9efe94527255ed87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3b160689d23db595ce781fc9efe94527255ed87/0_0_928_523/500.jpg\" alt=\"Berger with Tilda Swinton in The Seasons in Quincy.\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Berger with Tilda Swinton in<em> The Seasons in Quincy</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Berger\u2019s mother, Miriam, came from Bermondsey, south London (her father worked in the docks and looked after brewery dray horses). She had been a suffragette and, Berger has said, was a \u201cvery mysterious person, very secretive\u201d. But she was not secretive about her ambition that her son would one day become a writer. Berger prefers to avoid talking about his boarding school, St Edward\u2019s, Oxford, which he once described as \u201clunatic\u201d and with \u201csadism, torture, bullying\u2026 an absolutely monstrous place, a little totalitarian system\u201d. He was sent there aged six and ran away at 16. Was it at school he first understood that the world was unjust? \u201cI learnt even earlier,\u201d he replies, \u201cat about five.\u201d And he pauses and I wait. It is like watching a fisherman pulling on a line: \u201cMy mother \u2013 to make money to send me to school \u2013 made biscuits, sweets and chocolate to sell. I didn\u2019t see much of her as she was always in the kitchen, working. But once I was in the kitchen and a young man on a bicycle came in and asked for two bars of chocolate. She picked them up, told him the price and he said: \u2018Oh, forgive me, I\u2019ve not got this money, they\u2019re too expensive for me,\u2019 and walked out without any chocolate. And I was enormously struck by this incident. I did not judge. I did not judge my mother nor did I judge him for not having enough money.\u201d He pauses, \u201cI was just waiting for Karl Marx,\u201d and he laughs.</p> <p>In his essay Impertinence (in <em>Confabulations</em>), he describes the New Zealand governess (pre-school) who used to banish him into what she called \u201cthe Cry Cupboard\u201d whenever he wept. Sometimes his mother would come upstairs to see how he was doing and cheer him along with a box of her chocolate fudge. \u201cSchool, rather than confronting me with something, confirmed something I already felt because, from a very early age, I had this sense of harshness and the need for endurance.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This landscape was part of my energy, my body. I loved it not because it was a view \u2013 but because I participated in it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 1944 he joined up, refusing a commission with the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire light infantry, and became a lance corporal at a training camp. He preferred the company of working-class recruits, for whom he became a scribe, writing their letters home. In a sense, he has continued to do this all his life: telling other people\u2019s stories lest they vanish. In a conversation with Susan Sontag, he once said: \u201cA story is always a rescuing operation.\u201d And he has also said (in <em>The Seasons in Quincy</em>): \u201cIf I\u2019m a storyteller it\u2019s because I listen. For me, a storyteller is like a <em>passeur</em> who gets contraband across a frontier.\u201d</p> <p>In his 1975 book <em>A Seventh Man</em>, about migration, the rescuing impulse is clear. Berger writes in the preface: \u201cTo outline the experience of the migrant worker and to relate this to what surrounds him \u2013 both physically and historically \u2013 is to grasp more surely the political reality of the world at this moment. The subject is European, its meaning is global. Its theme is unfreedom.\u201d When he considers today\u2019s refugee crisis \u2013 no longer confined to Europe \u2013 does he see the first world as suffering from a failure of imagination? There is another extended pause, like a ravine into which one might fall. Eventually he replies: \u201cWhat two different people have in common will always, in all cases, be larger than what differentiates them. And yet for dozens of different reasons, circumstances blind people to that.\u201d</p> <p>And what does he think about Brexit? He leans back on the sofa (we have now shifted from the overheated study into a cooler parlour, a sofa crawl in operation) and admits it has always been important to him to define himself as European. He then attempts to describe what he sees as the bigger picture: \u201cIt seems to me that we have to return, to recapitulate what globalisation meant, because it meant that capitalism, the world financial organisations, became speculative and ceased to be first and foremost productive, and politicians lost nearly all their power to take political decisions \u2013 I mean politicians in the traditional sense. Nations ceased to be what they were before.\u201d In Meanwhile (the last essay in <em>Landscapes</em>) he notes that the word \u201chorizon\u201d has slipped out of view in political discourse. And he adds, returning to Brexit, that he voted with his feet long ago, moving to France.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"60577ec26b72ae2f91c7e80139b067e8bc9c5d36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60577ec26b72ae2f91c7e80139b067e8bc9c5d36/0_0_2184_2743/796.jpg\" alt=\"John Berger c1962, the year he moved to France.\" width=\"796\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Berger c1962, the year he moved to France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Keen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We talk about what it is for a person to adopt a foreign country as home, and about how it is possible to love a landscape like a familiar face. For Berger, that face is the Haute-Savoie. \u201cThis is the landscape I lived in for decades [he left only after Beverly died; his son Yves still lives there with his family]. It matters to me because during that time, I worked there like a peasant. OK, don\u2019t let\u2019s exaggerate. I didn\u2019t work as hard as they did but I worked pretty hard, doing exactly the same things as the peasants, working with them. This landscape was part of my energy, my body, my satisfaction and discomfort. I loved it not because it was a view \u2013 but because I participated in it.\u201d</p> <p>He explains: \u201cThe connection between the human condition and labour is frequently forgotten, and for me was always so important. At 16, I went down a coal mine in Derbyshire and spent a day on the coal face \u2013 just watching the miners. It had a profound effect.\u201d What did it make you feel? \u201cRespect,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cJust respect. There are two kinds. Respect to do with ceremony \u2013 what happens when you visit the House of Lords. And a completely different respect associated with danger.\u201d He says: \u201cThis is not a prescription for others, but when I look back on my life I think it\u2019s very significant I never went to a university. I refused to go. Lots of people were pushing me and I said, \u2018No. I don\u2019t want to\u2019, because those years at university form a whole way of thinking.\u201d And you feel free from that? \u201cYes.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even at my old age, I\u2019m still capable of getting very angry</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Berger \u2013 fittingly, given his work with peasants \u2013 means shepherd in French. Do the French see him as one of their own? \u201cMy writing in France has not had a huge impact. The countries where I\u2019m most read are Spain, Latin American and until recently, oddly, Turkey\u2026 and Italy.\u201d Nor has he lived up to his surname, except \u201cI\u2019ve occasionally taken a ewe on heat in the back of my 2CV to meet a ram\u201d. I say we don\u2019t call that shepherding, we call that something else. He laughs. He is a man of action: until a few months ago he was (a most dashing octogenarian) still riding a motorbike. Nella tells me they hope it won\u2019t be long before he rides again \u2013 and swims. Berger is a keen swimmer and, in <em>Confabulations</em>, writes brilliantly about the democracy of swimming \u2013 people stripped of telltale trappings, doing their lengths. \u201cWhen you are swimming,\u201d he says, \u201cyou become almost weightless, and that weightlessness has something in common with thought.\u201d There is also a wonderful account in <a href=\"http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2011/11/22/john-berger-on-%E2%80%98bento%E2%80%99s-sketchbook%E2%80%99/\"><em>Bento\u2019s Sketchbook </em></a>of a friendship he strikes up with a Cambodian woman who shares the same Parisian swimming pool. She gives him a painting of a bird and, he maintains, teaches him something about homelessness.</p> <p>As he nudges closer to 90, Berger feels his own way of seeing has changed surprisingly little, although, he points out, technology has changed the way younger generations explore art. He admits, then, to his enthusiasm for texting: \u201cI\u2019ve been a fan for a long while because it\u2019s like whispers \u2013 and with that goes intimacy, secrecy, playfulness\u2026\u201d But there is nothing fixed about the way he sees. He believes one never sees the same picture twice: \u201cThe second time I saw the <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Grunewald_Isenheim1.jpg\">Gr\u00fcnewald altarpiece</a> was after a terrorist attack \u2013 it was the same painting yet I saw it differently.\u201d The importance of certain painters has shifted too. He reveres Modigliani less, admires Vel\u00e1zquez more: \u201cWhen one is young, one likes drama, excitation, bravura \u2013 Vel\u00e1zquez has none of this.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/12/john-berger-writing-is-an-off-shoot-of-something-deeper\">John Berger: \u2018Writing is an off-shoot of something deeper\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a writer, Berger has always had a gift for making absences present. Can he summon the people he has lost in his mind? \u201cYes, yes, yes\u2026 they are very present.\u201d I tell him how moved I was by his essay Krakow (in <em>Landscapes</em>), in which he remembers a New Zealand teacher, Ken, a huge influence on him. And his eyes fill as I speak. It was Ken who told him that whenever he could not sleep, he should \u201cimagine you are shuffling a pack of cards\u201d \u2013 advice he still follows. Ken also taught him the trick (not so useful now) of how to walk into a pub for a spot of underage drinking: \u201cDon\u2019t look back\u2026 don\u2019t doubt for a moment, just be surer of yourself than they are.\u201d And he advised against self-pity. \u201cWhenever I might have been filled with self-pity, I turned it into furious anger. Even at my old age, I\u2019m still capable of getting very angry.\u201d</p> <p>But Berger\u2019s greatest strength in old age is his ability to live in the present. \u201cI cultivated this early on \u2013 and this is the paradox \u2013 because it was an escape from prescriptions, prophecies, consequences and causes.\u201d The present moment is key to his thinking too. In <em>Ways of Seeing</em>, he suggests that paintings embody the present in which they were painted. Defining the secret of reading aloud well, he says it is \u201crefusing to look ahead, to be in the moment\u201d. And he says that a story puts its listener \u201cin an eternal present\u201d. He has also written about the circularity of time. Does he think that applies to an individual life? Is there, in old age, a way in which one starts to hold hands with one\u2019s younger self?</p> <p>\u201cTime is circular, and in relation to that portrait of Melina, that is exactly what I feel.\u201d He suggests I take a photo of the painting. We carry it into the sunlight, prop it against the back of a chair. I say the <em>Observer</em> will need a photograph to go with this interview and he asks with boyish mischief: \u201cCouldn\u2019t we use her instead?\u201d</p> <p>It is only after I get home that I realise I failed to ask him how he intends to spend his birthday. I text him and he rings straight back. \u201cListen,\u201d he says, \u201cI feel so grateful to have reached 90 \u2013 it is such an age \u2013 and to my friends for wanting to celebrate, but what I\u2019ve told them all is that what we ought to do on the day is be silent. My birthday should just be a day like any other.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>To order <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/337806/s/portraits-john-berger-on-artists/\">Portraits</a>, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/landscapes-445318.html\">Landscapes</a> or <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/confabulations.html\">Confabulations</a> by John Berger at a discount, go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846<br><br></li> <li>The Seasons in Quincy will be screened on 11 November at the Birkbeck Cinema, 43 Gordon Square WC1, 6pm, as part of the <a href=\"http://www.bbk.ac.uk/events-calendar/bimi-in-collaboration-with-the-derek-jarman-lab-presents-faces-of-john-berger-symposium\">Faces of John Berger symposium</a>; and on 17 November at <a href=\"http://www.curzongoldsmiths.com/comingsoon/john-berger\">Curzon Goldsmiths</a>, London SE14, 6.30pm</li> </ul> <ul> <li>A Jar of Wild Flowers: Essays in Celebration of John Berger is published by <a href=\"https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/a-jar-of-wild-flowers/forthcoming/\">Zed Books</a> on 15 November. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/jar-of-wild-flowers.html\">Click here to preorder a copy</a></li> </ul>",
  "<p>This is what greets you when you arrive at a Trump rally: two 18-wheelers parked outside the sports stadium where the Republican nominee will be speaking, placed end-to-end so that nobody can miss them. The front truck, painted white, has \u201cThe Donald for President\u201d scrawled across its side, above the slogans: \u201cAll lives matter\u201d, \u201cBuild the wall\u201d, and \u201cKeep Mexican dope in Mexico\u201d.</p> <p>It is a relatively gentle introduction to Trumpworld, a scattering of antagonism for the gathering crowd. If only the same could be said about the yellow truck parked right behind it.</p> <p>\u201cHillary for prison\u201d, it says beside a picture of Hillary Clinton behind bars. Another image of the Democratic presidential candidate has her brains spilling out of her skull with the caption: \u201cConcussion wired\u201d. Bill Clinton is seen laughing above the words: \u201cJust realized if Hillary wins \u2026 I get interns\u201d. A final shot of Hillary has her pointing at her husband and saying: \u201cBill! Monica gave you what?\u201d</p> <p>A couple of hundred feet away, in full view of the trucks, thousands of supporters patiently line up to hear their idol. Many of them have been here for hours.

Thousands lining up to Make America Great Again in the shadow of an 18-wheeler covered in crude sexual references.</p> <p>As the bewildering 2016 presidential election draws to a close, some basic questions are left hanging in the air. After we have spent months watching the impossible happen, of hearing the defense of the indefensible, of observing American values \u2013 one after another \u00ad\u2013 fall like bowling pins, it\u2019s time to ask: what has this sometimes maddening, bizarre, gruesome, hilarious, shocking, scary Trump phenomenon been about? More urgently, once the pall of this most baffling of presidential elections has cleared and 8 November fades into the background, what will the Donald have left behind?</p> <p>Some of the answers to those questions come easily, shared freely by Trump\u2019s supporters as they wait in line. Conspiracy theories are one aspect of the destruction wrought by Hurricane Donald likely to be with us for a long time.</p> <p>Here\u2019s Vjekoslav Grgas, a Croatian American, standing dutifully in the non-VIP line. In five short minutes, he rattles off a litany of horror stories. Did you know that three men were assassinated at the Democratic national convention in July to cover up the fact that they were the source of the WikiLeaks dump of hacked Democratic emails? Or that the liberal financier George Soros bankrolled several US foreign policy disasters, and that Hillary Clinton personally pocketed 99% of the donations to the Clinton Foundation following the 2010 Haiti earthquake? In a rare note of discordance with the Republican nominee, he even adds that Trump was wrong <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-video\">to finally admit</a> last month that Barack Obama is an American, as the US president\u2019s birth certificate was obviously Photoshopped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec3b4e951c427721a192bb9148bf263de64fa714\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec3b4e951c427721a192bb9148bf263de64fa714/0_324_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"supporters cheer at the rally.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Trump\u2019s going to say what needs to be said\u2019: supporters cheer at the rally.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other elements of the Trump phenomenon are more difficult to tease out. Phrases are thrown out<strong> </strong>from the line with such repetitive frequency that they take on the blandness of cliches. One of the VIP Bikers for Trump, John Hearl, is among many at the rally who says he likes the reality TV star because unlike career politicians, Trump \u201cspeaks his own mind\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s going to say what needs to be said, and if that offends somebody, well then, they just have to understand the goal of all this.\u201d</p> <p>Which is?</p> <p>\u201cAmerica first.\u201d</p> <p>A little further ahead in the VIP line stands Carole Urban, wearing a sequined hat in the colors of the American flag. She says she is also looking forward to hearing Trump speaking, because \u201che\u2019s down to our level. He\u2019s not like past presidents who prepare a beautiful speech but it\u2019s not coming from the heart. He speaks it like it is.\u201d</p> <p>Beautiful speeches from past presidents. Is she referring to Obama?</p> <p>She pulls her shoulders back and with a note of indignation says: \u201cWhen I first heard Obama I was elected, I thought he could improve our country. I voted for him in 2008. I was so disillusioned in him \u2013 after four years, he helped ruin this country.\u201d</p> <p>Was part of that disillusionment to do with Obama\u2019s \u201cbeautiful speech\u201d, as she puts it? <br></p> <p>She shrugs a second time. \u201cYes, I was angry about his oratory. The way he was speaking, it touched my soul, it was so beautiful. A black person, everyone says, but he\u2019s actually mulatto. I thought he could do a great job helping American people, but it didn\u2019t happen like that.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask Urban about how, as a woman, she feels about Trump\u2019s self-confessed sexually predatory behavior, she gets indignant. \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of this being brought up. Words come out in the wrong way at times; you put your foot in your mouth. I don\u2019t think Donald Trump is remotely derogatory to women.\u201d</p> <p>To follow Urban\u2019s train of thought: Trump is loved by his supporters not just because of the content of what he says, such as his seemingly endless ability to insult anyone from <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/06/16/trump_mexico_not_sending_us_their_best_criminals_drug_dealers_and_rapists_are_crossing_border.html\">Mexicans</a> to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration/\">Muslims</a> to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/politics/donald-trump-african-american-voters/\">African Americans</a> to <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/news/a44629/donald-trump-insults-women/\">women</a>. It\u2019s also the way he says it. It\u2019s the language he uses: unscripted, unpolished, and not infrequently unintelligible. He is the antithesis of the fancy, considered Obama, with the Harvard law degree and the \u201cbeautiful speech\u201d.</p> <p>The contrast is worth exploring. Here is Obama speaking on the campaign trail at a similar end-game stage in the 2008 election: \u201cHope! That\u2019s what kept our parents going when times were tough. It\u2019s what led immigrants from distant lands to come to these shores against great odds and carve a new life for their families in America; what led those who couldn\u2019t vote to march and organize and stand for freedom, that led them to cry out: \u2018It may look dark tonight, but if I hold on to hope, tomorrow will be brighter.\u2019\u201d </p> <p></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwiVqCbizKg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AwiVqCbizKg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>And here is Trump speaking tonight at the rally, reproduced verbatim: \u201cBikers love me. I will see these bikers, oftentimes on Harleys, not always, but a lot of times. I feel so safe with these bikers. A lot of times they don\u2019t want to come inside, they just want to make sure I feel safe. I love you guys, I love you guys.\u201d</p> <p>Or this on his rival: \u201cHillary lied. No, no, no, she lied. She\u2019s a liar. And she lied and she lied. She lied. It\u2019s so important we vote in November so that we get rid of these liars, these incompetent people, the Hillary Clintons.\u201d</p> <p>So what if Trump\u2019s diction is less than perfect? There are no rules on how a would-be president should communicate with the people, nor are there minimum standards of rhetorical prowess for the White House.</p> <p>What seems apparent is that Trump has given his followers the license to emulate him in throwing caution to the wind and saying things that previously were considered unacceptable. Trump has also opened a new era in American politics in which it doesn\u2019t matter what you say or how you say it. Be as offensive as you like. Speak your own mind.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-poll-assuming-win-is-downright-dangerous\">Stop right there: assuming a Hillary Clinton victory is downright dangerous | Kate Aronoff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Inside the sports stadium, the impact of the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s anti-oratory is all around us.

Lock her up! Lock her up!\u201d chants fill thestadium. </p> <p>The former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani comes on to introduce the main speaker and immediately launches into a story about locker rooms, turning the candidate\u2019s excuse for why he bragged about grabbing \u201cpussy\u201d into a joke. Then he turns his comments on Clinton, adding: \u201cI\u2019m going to get down off the stage with you into the basket of deplorables. Because unlike Clinton, you speak the truth. You\u2019re for real, she\u2019s a phoney.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a disconnect between the ugly schoolyard name-calling coming from the speakers and the outward appearance of their audience. Yes, there are the usual smattering of patriotic followers in costume of the sort that frequent any Republican event: women robed in the Stars and Stripes; men posing as Uncle Sam with crooked top hats like wonky chimneys on their heads.

She\u2019s unfit to be president.\u201d</p> <p>Trump enters the auditorium and the atmosphere rises to another level. Before he arrived it was already electric; now it\u2019s like one of those static balls that make your hair stand on end.</p> <p>The candidate launches into his routinely un-beautiful speech. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about Crooked Hillary, what about the crooked media? CNN is a disgrace. CNN is a disgrace.\u201d</p> <p>A huge boo erupts from the stadium floor as the crowd turns towards the media compound where reporters and camera operators are penned in for the duration. Trump\u2019s invective has an immediate and chilling impact among the crowd. Men and women who only moments ago were pleasantly talking to us, sharing generously their reflections on the state of the nation, are now jabbing their fingers in our direction and spitting: \u201cCNN sucks!

And the intersections between my saga and Noel Field\u2019s saga are bizarre.\u201d<br></p> <p>In precis, Field\u2019s bizarre saga is this. Appalled by the horrors of the first world war, an internationalist and pacifist, he was pushed left by the Great Depression, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1927/03/the-case-of-sacco-and-vanzetti/306625/\">the executions of Sacco and Vanzetti</a> and President Hoover\u2019s brutal treatment of <a href=\"https://zinnedproject.org/materials/the-bonus-army/\">the Bonus Army</a>.

He hoped to find new purpose but he was seized, taken to Hungary, imprisoned and brutally tortured.</p> <p>Field became a pawn in the last Stalinist purges, his name deployed in show trials to incriminate others though he was never tried himself. As Marton tells in shattering sequence, in the most extraordinary passages of an extraordinary book, family members went behind the Iron Curtain to find him. They paid a terrible cost.

The Field family made available correspondence which \u201cforms very much the spine of this book\u201d.</p> <p>Marton discovered a truly extraordinary character, a man whose motives might genuinely be described as good who ended up working against his own country, in the service of a nightmare regime. Field suffered brutally for such loyalty. But he was directly implicated in the death of at least one person and his name was used to condemn many others. Throughout the book, the horrors of the Gulag loom large.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a human drama in a political context,\u201d Marton says, \u201cbut to me what\u2019s interesting is what motivates such a person \u2013 well-born, superbly educated with every privilege, poised on a dream career \u2013 to espouse one of the most violent, destructive ideologies?\u201d</p> <p>She cannot have imagined that her attempt to answer this question would be published at such a propitious time. For one thing, the book has come out in the midst of a presidential election in which one candidate\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-paul-manafort-ukraine-russia-putin-ties\">apparent ties to Russia and a brutal Russian leader</a> have been constantly, hotly and sensationally debated. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-paul-manafort-ukraine-russia-putin-ties\">Donald Trump and Russia: a web that grows more tangled all the time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the name \u201cDonald Trump\u201d comes up in conversation, Marton \u2013 a friend of the Clintons \u2013 grimaces and elides, though she alights on an issue nonetheless distinctly linked to the rise of the Republican presidential nominee.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very involved with refugee issues,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m an overseer of the <a href=\"https://www.rescue.org/\">International Rescue Committee</a> and I\u2019m a refugee myself, having benefited from American largesse. And [in the 1930s] as now the country was showing its worst side, its least generous side to refugees, in that case fleeing Nazism. And this played a big role in Field\u2019s radicalisation.</p> <p>\u201cOf course the connection to today\u2019s world is very interesting to me, regarding the power of an idea to blind a man and how fanaticism works. And when I finished writing this, I thought: \u2018Holy cow, how am I ever going to get the public\u2019s attention when the public is obsessed with Trump and the \u2018war against terror\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019m going to write an essay and put it right at the front of the book, called The Capture of Minds, whereby I connect the capture of young, alienated, lost idealists today by a really destructive, toxic but addictive ideology, that is Islamic fundamentalism, with its 1930s equivalent, which was global communism and Stalinism, for another disenchanted generation which had basically given up on their own countries\u2019 ability to set things to rights.</p> <p>\u201cAmerica then was a nation that was deeply divided, and its youth had given up on politics as usual. So they were very susceptible to a messiah promising to right every wrong.\u201d</p> <h2>Witches in the government</h2> <p>Inevitably, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/books/review/true-believer-kati-marton.html?_r=0\">reviewers</a> of Marton\u2019s book have cited the novels of John Le Carr\u00e9, presenting Field as a spy who did not come in from the cold. The sheer naivety of her subject, however, sometimes brings the book closer, in a bizarre way, to the comedies of PG Wodehouse. In one extraordinary scene, Field, intoxicated on his faith, bounds up the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to sing the Internationale in Russian, horrified NKVD handlers milling embarrassedly about below. Imagine a great lost masterpiece \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/may/07/pg-wodehouse-creative-writing-leave-it-to-psmith-reading-group\">Psmith</a>: Stalinist Spy. </p> <p>But if there is comedy in Marton\u2019s larger story, it is pitch black. Somehow, while Field was spying for Stalin in 1930s Washington, he went undetected. Some suspected him in Europe but the story of how he went east \u2013 was arrested, jailed, tortured and finally released into carefully controlled retirement \u2013 is shot through with instances of remarkable human frailty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8c3835e099ecce059b5cf44806678d7edf3d66a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8c3835e099ecce059b5cf44806678d7edf3d66a/82_0_4831_2900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alger Hiss\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two police photographs, circa 1949, of former US state department official and accused communist spy Alger Hiss.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Orwell also looms over Marton\u2019s tale, in Spain and in the cells and torture chambers of eastern Europe.

He was much less of a cynic than your lot, if I may call them that. He was needy of family, a larger family, and a sense of belonging, which the party offered even if he was not allowed to join that party until he was useless to Moscow as a spy.</p> <p>\u201cThen he joined, and typically for this man who never failed to make the wrong choice, he joined the Communist party in the year that it imploded, 1956, with Khrushchev denouncing Stalin followed by the Hungarian revolution, the first armed popular uprising against Soviet rule. That\u2019s when Field finally came in from the cold, as an open member of the Communist party.\u201d</p> <p>Marton\u2019s book may help bring Field to the light, alongside Hiss and Philby, Blunt and Maclean in the halls of Anglo-American infamy.</p> <ul> <li><em>True Believer: Stalin\u2019s Last American Spy, by Kati Marton, is out now in the US.

  "<p>Leonie Orton is the youngest sister of the playwright Joe Orton (he was born in 1933, and she in 1944). They grew up on a Leicester council estate; their father, Bill, worked as a gardener, and their mother, Elsie, worked as a factory machinist,&nbsp;and then as a char. But while Joe was keen to better himself and eventually won a place at Rada, Leonie remained in Leicester, where she also worked in a factory, married and had two daughters. In London, Joe lived with Kenneth Halliwell, whom he had met at Rada, in a tiny <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/sep/30/halliwell-orton-art-collage-library-books\" title=\"\">Islington bedsit</a>. The relationship was tortured and complex, and Halliwell, jealous of Orton\u2019s success and fearful he might be abandoned, murdered him, and killed himself, in 1967. Joe kept all Leonie\u2019s teenage letters to him, and they are now in the <a href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/library/find/specialcollections/specialcollections/joe-orton-collection\" title=\"\">Orton collection</a> at Leicester University. Leonie has written a memoir, <em>I Had It&nbsp;in Me</em>.</p> <p><strong>Why did you decide to write your story after all these years?</strong><br>When John Lahr wrote <em>Prick Up Your Ears</em> [in 1978], it irked me. I was hurt. It\u2019s a very good biography, but I didn\u2019t know his Joe Orton, and I struggled to understand how he, a Californian, had done it. He never met my brother. Joe said: \u201cI\u2019m from the gutter, and don\u2019t you ever forget it because I won\u2019t.\u201d I shared that gutter. I wanted to show where he came from, the awful poverty and deprivation.

Why was that? </strong><br>Very often the oldest sibling, and the youngest, do have a connection. I hero-worshipped him, and I think he knew that. We had the same feelings about our parents, a detachment. Elsie [their mother] was horrible, though I think that was all born out of frustration and not having any money. Like most women of her time and class, her only way out was to marry. But she and my dad weren\u2019t at all happy. She loved to humiliate him. Like Joe, she liked an audience. That wonderful line in <em>What the Butler Saw</em>, when Mrs Prentice says: \u201cMy uterine contractions have been bogus for some time,\u201d I can hear my mother in that: it\u2019s the same rhythm. My father, on the other hand, was this mild-mannered, insipid man. He was everything Joe hated, and there are characters like him in all his plays. I think Joe kept in contact with his family, not out of love, but because he needed to touch base with his roots. That\u2019s where his dialogue came from.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Joe threw me a lifeline, even if it did take me many years to realise it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You write that the family had no idea Joe was gay until after his death. Is this true, or did you only see what you wanted to?</strong><br>It sounds stupid now, but I really didn\u2019t know. In the early 60s, it just wasn\u2019t talked about. I thought Kenneth Halliwell was just a flatmate. Having said that, perhaps my mother had an inkling. \u201cWhat do you want to live with a bald-headed man for?\u201d she asked him. But I wasn\u2019t making the connections. When I read the diaries [edited by Lahr, and published in 1986], I was shocked. In the toilets with a dwarf and all that! [Orton was promiscuous, and keen on cottaging.] I thought, no, it can\u2019t be true. But he did have this desire to shock, and perhaps they\u2019re part of that. It was another thing he got from our mother.

But he left you a great gift, didn\u2019t he?</strong><br>Yes. He threw me a lifeline, even if it did take me many years to realise it. I was working in a hosiery factory, a dead-end job. But then the money from his estate started to come in. At first, I used it to indulge my material side. But that was so unfulfilling; it didn\u2019t relieve my sense of inferiority. I knew I had to do something else. So I got educated [she took O-levels, studied at the Open University, and got a job as a library assistant at the University of Leicester], and I got more involved with the estate [she took over as its administrator in 2004]. It has been very satisfying. I used to ask my other brother [Douglas]: doesn\u2019t it bother you that you don\u2019t understand Joe\u2019s work? He would say, \u201cNo, I\u2019m a plumber\u201d, and I would think, \u201cWell, why&nbsp;don\u2019t&nbsp;you get up off your arse and try?\u201d I hope I understand Joe\u2019s work myself, now \u2013 even <em>What the Butler Saw</em>, with all its stylised&nbsp;language.</p> <p><strong>Joe\u2019s diaries end on 1 August 1967, suddenly, with&nbsp;a&nbsp;hyphen, and some believe pages were lost, or even removed.

I\u2019d like to think they are out there somewhere. It would help to know more. I don\u2019t want to be too dramatic, but I do think: why? All I can do is liken it to the situation of an artist who paints something, and then decides it\u2019s not what he wants it to be, and slashes it. Kenneth saw his relationship with Joe a bit like that. He felt he had created him, so he could bloody well destroy him, too.</p> <h2><strong>An extract from Leonie Orton\u2019s I Had It in Me</strong></h2> <p><strong>In October 1964, Leonie married George Barnett, a toolmaker. They spent their four-day honeymoon at a London hotel, and Joe (known to his family as John) bought them tickets to see Frankie Howerd in <em>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</em>. They were also invited to have tea with Joe and his boyfriend, Kenneth Halliwell, at their bedsit in Noel Road, Islington.</strong><br>It was a strange tea we had with them that day. There was no table in their small room, which was made even smaller by the collage of illustration plates that were pasted floor to ceiling on the back wall. These were the ones they\u2019d removed from library books and contributed to their prison sentences. The two chairs which George and I occupied appeared to be the only ones they had. While we ate our plate of cucumber sandwiches Joe sat on the floor and Kenneth perched nervously on the edge of one of their twin beds. When Kenneth brought out the cups of tea, it ended up as a sort of juggling act, balancing the sandwiches on our knee while we placed the teacups on the floor: Kenneth ate nothing, sipping at his tea and barely speaking, and then only to Joe.</p> <p>And then there was the cake. Joe appeared from the kitchenette holding aloft a plate in the middle of which sat a battenberg. He was parading in front of us, holding the plate like an exhibit at an auction. Turning the plate around he began to elucidate on its wonderful symmetrical qualities: the pink and yellowness of the sponge and the precision of the marzipan. They both agreed it was as perfect as a cake could be. To me it was just an ordinary factory-produced Lyons battenberg, but they were discussing it like it was a work of art.</p> <p>The memory of that afternoon puzzled me. It seemed staged, as if we were performers in a Wilde play. I didn\u2019t understand what was going on. Were they sending us up because we were philistines? Joe had never been pretentious towards me. Quite the reverse was true. Sensing my vulnerability he\u2019d always been protective towards me. Like the time I\u2019d gone with him to the New Arts theatre to see <em>Entertaining Mr Sloane</em>. Sitting next to him in the stalls afterwards, he asked what I thought of the play. I wanted to say something intelligent but I just said: \u201cIt made me laugh.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as it made you laugh.\u201d So perhaps the cake wasn\u2019t a send-up, just a tease. What captivated me about Joe was his supreme confidence. I loved being around him.</p> <p><strong>In December 1966, Elsie, Leonie and Joe\u2019s mother, died at home in Leicester. Neither of them felt any grief for her. She had been an indifferent, sometimes cruel parent. Joe had been as dutiful a son as she was a mother.</strong><br>On 29 December, Joe arrived in Leicester for the funeral. In his diary for that day he recorded: \u201cI had a bit of quick sex in a derelict house with a labourer I picked up.\u201d Later that afternoon six of us lined up at the door of the chapel of rest where Mam\u2019s corpse was laid out. Joe was intrigued by Mam\u2019s outfit. She was wearing a long white shift dress and a white satin quilted robe with gold lapels and cuffs held together by a thick gold cord complete with tassels. They\u2019d made her face up: rouge on the cheeks, red lipstick and blue eyeshadow. She would have loved all this elaborate stuff, I think to myself. I can see her now, getting ready to go to the works Christmas party. She\u2019d borrowed a gold lam\u00e9 dress and her bulges were almost kept in place by her new pink, boned corset. She couldn\u2019t afford to buy any gold shoes so had painted a pair of black court shoes with gold modelling paint. When the paint dried, the shoes were rigid, causing her to walk stiffly. During the evening the paint began to crack and left behind a trail of gold dust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce3ef28386664978b0c655365cc96b0ac47e9c3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce3ef28386664978b0c655365cc96b0ac47e9c3a/0_226_2826_1696/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Orton with Dudley Sutton and Madge Ryan who played Mr Sloane and Kath in Orton\u2019s first play, Entertaining Mr Sloane, which opened in London\u2019s West End in 1964.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Orton with Dudley Sutton and Madge Ryan who played Mr Sloane and Kath in Orton\u2019s first play, Entertaining Mr Sloane, which opened in London\u2019s West End in 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMam would have loved the posh dressing gown,\u201d I said. Joe said he thought it was only for show and that they wouldn\u2019t bury her in it. He was bending over her: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look like Mum without her glasses.\u201d I noted that since living in London he referred to Mam as \u201cmum\u201d. Joe touched her hand, commenting on how cold it was. Lifting it he asked if anyone wanted the cheap marcasite ring she still had on. We all declined. Walking round to the other side of the coffin he noticed a brown stain on the white headrest. He tilted her head to one side to investigate further. He thought it was probably embalming fluid that was leaking out. On the way back, an argument broke out as Marilyn [Leonie\u2019s older sister] wanted to know who\u2019d had the slippers she\u2019d bought Mam for Christmas. No one owned up to taking them. Joe told her it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cIt\u2019s all right for you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got plenty.\u201d</p> <p><strong>On 9 August 1967, Kenneth Halliwell attacked Joe Orton at their Islington bedsit, hitting his head with a hammer nine times. He then swallowed 22 Nembutals, washed down with a can of grapefruit juice. Halliwell died first. </strong><br>The next time I saw my brother Joe was when he came to Leicester to see a production of <em>Entertaining Mr Sloane</em> at the Phoenix theatre. He arrived on 1 August 1967. I cooked a meal for him and Dad. I told him how awful the birthing process had been [Leonie had recently had a daughter, Lois] and how pleased I was to have left hospital with a live baby. I asked him if he wanted to hold her, and he did. He noted how small she was. On the evening of 2 August, he went to the Phoenix theatre. The following day I put Lois in her pram and walked to Dad\u2019s house where I\u2019d arranged to see Joe before he caught his train back to London. We sat in the kitchen discussing Dad. Joe said Dad had scalded his hand making tea when he missed the teapot, and he shouldn\u2019t live on his own. \u201cHe can\u2019t see properly, and I don\u2019t want him living with me,\u201d I said. Joe nodded in agreement: \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d I agreed to make some inquiries. We walked down Trenant Road together. He pushed the pram. As we parted he kissed me. I said something like: \u201cHave a safe journey back.\u201d He told me to write to him: \u201cI\u2019ll always answer your letters, you know,\u201d he said. I watched him as he walked down Stonesby Avenue to catch his bus. He turned and we waved to one another. I never saw him again.</p> <p>George [her husband] and I returned home the following Wednesday evening after visiting his parents. As we walked up the path to the back door, our neighbours, Michael and Edna Johnson, appeared. While Michael spoke to George, Edna drew me to one side, commenting on how pretty Lois was. When George told me to give Lois to him, I instantly knew something wasn\u2019t right. We went inside the house. \u201cJohn\u2019s dead,\u201d he said. At first, I didn\u2019t make the connection with Joe. I assumed he was referring to our other neighbour, John Marshall. I said: \u201cOh no, what will Elizabeth (my neighbour\u2019s wife) do?\u201d George said: \u201cNo, not John next door; your John, Joe.\u201d I didn\u2019t break down at what George had just said; it seemed too baffling, not possible. How? When? Are you sure? \u201cIt\u2019s just been on the telly, the six o\u2019clock news,\u201d George said. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not possible. They tell the family first, don\u2019t they?\u201d I was trying to think who to contact to find out if it was true when Dougie [her brother] pulled up outside. He, too, had heard it on the news: \u201cIt\u2019s our John, all right. Ken\u2019s done him in. I rang the Leicester police and they gave me a number for the Islington police.\u201d Dougie left with a promise to let me know the details when he had them. He\u2019d been asked to go to London the next day to identify Joe\u2019s body. I wanted to go with him, but he thought I\u2019d be too distressed. I thought he shouldn\u2019t go on his own, and George offered to go with him.</p> <p>I waited anxiously for George to return from London but he couldn\u2019t answer any of my questions, saying only that Dougie identified Joe. George wasn\u2019t allowed into the mortuary room. \u201cHe must have told you something,\u201d I pressed. \u201cAll he said was he had no top to his head.\u201d All he said! All he said! I needed to speak to Dougie. He came to see us on Friday morning. He asked me if I\u2019d seen the papers. \u201cOnly the <em>Daily Mirror</em>. It says Ken\u2019s killed him and then killed himself.\u201d Dougie looked straight at me: \u201cKen murdered John. He took a hammer to his head and then took some pills and done himself in. That\u2019s what happened\u2026 You know what they\u2019re saying about John and Ken, don\u2019t you?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cIn the [<em>Daily</em>] <em>Sketch</em> they reckon they\u2019re homos.\u201d This was a revelation to the family. I could hardly believe it. John, homosexual? \u201cDo you think it\u2019s true?\u201d I asked. Dougie appeared embarrassed. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s true,\u201d I puzzled. \u201cBecause after leaving home, he only ever lived with Kenneth.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7c0b32498cfcc3957e2573f5e53c7637a989c262\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c0b32498cfcc3957e2573f5e53c7637a989c262/0_379_3017_3771/800.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Orton outside the Lyceum Theatre, New York.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Orton outside the Lyceum Theatre, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin G Brooks Abipp/\u00a9 Orton Estate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The funeral was arranged for Friday 18 August at Golders Green crematorium in London. I arranged for a friend to look after Lois and travelled there in a yellow Ford Anglia driven by our Auntie Lucy. When we arrived at the crematorium, the attendant asked: \u201cAre you the 2.15, or the 2.30?\u201d We were about to answer when a woman stepped forward wearing a white suit with an enormous white fox fur collar. \u201cHello,\u201d she said, proffering her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Peggy Ramsay, Joe\u2019s agent.\u201d I was a little shocked at the white suit. We didn\u2019t wear white for funerals. We were all in dour mourning shades of grey, black and purple. \u201cI\u2019m sorry there\u2019s a lot of press here,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve no control over them. To them, this is considered a fashionable funeral.\u201d</p> <p>As we approached, I heard people inside chatting, but as we came in, this ceased. Peggy led us down to the front seats. We sat waiting for the ceremony to begin. Dad, confused, had to be reminded to take his cap off. He sat wringing his hands, wanting a running commentary on what was happening. Had they brought in the coffin yet? What was that strange music? Do you think there\u2019s a toilet here? All this was audible at least four rows back. I told him to shut up and stop showing us up. As the coffin was carried in \u2013 it was draped in purple velvet with a huge spray of red roses on top \u2013 the mourners remained seated. The pall bearers were friends [of Joe\u2019s] from the Royal Court theatre. The music was a recording of A Day in the Life from <em>Sergeant Pepper</em> with all the psychedelic noise at the end ineptly obliterated. It wasn\u2019t a good recording. It spluttered and restarted several times. The first line of the song is about reading the news and a lucky man who makes the grade. I had read the news. The <em>Daily Mirror</em>\u2019s headline ran: \u201cAuthor of Hit Play Murdered By Friend.\u201d</p> <p>After the coffin had been placed on the conveyor rollers, a man I didn\u2019t recognise but now know was Harold Pinter, stepped up to the lectern. He read the poem Nox Est Perpetua by Marion Lochhead. Donald Pleasence then got up. This man I recognised. He seemed tense, checked his flies, a quirky half smile on his face. I thought he looked exactly like the character he played in <em>The Great Escape</em>. Joe said to me once that many actors don\u2019t act, they just play themselves. He unfolded a sheet of paper and read <a href=\"http://www.joeorton.org/Pages/Joe_Orton_Life16a.html\" title=\"\">Hilarium Memoriam JO,</a> a poem written by his wife, Josephine Martin Crombie.</p> <p>After Pleasence stepped down we were given a few minutes in silent contemplation. I\u2019m little again. Joe is holding my hand and we\u2019re at the gate of Marriott Road infant school. He\u2019s smiling down at me: \u201cOff you go, then.\u201d I look at the purple draped box in front of me. I never knew this sabre-toothed playwright the critics talk about, or the promiscuous homosexual. The celebrity these people are gathered here to mourn, this Joe Orton, I didn\u2019t know him. It\u2019s the other person, my brother John, I shall miss. He was one of the only people to show me any real kindness. He was my hero.</p> <p>Faintly, those first quiet, soft notes of Edward Elgar\u2019s Nimrod began to fill the now silent crematorium. I rummaged in the sleeve of my coat, trying to find my handkerchief. As I wiped away tears, my sister gave me a comforting nudge. The coffin started to move but it faltered and juddered like a car on a bad hill start. There was an awful moment when I thought the mechanism had broken down. Finally, the rollers moved the coffin towards the small trapdoor. The double curtains dropped down and the show was over.</p> <p>We were escorted out by Ramsay. \u201cOh dear, how awful, the recording of the Beatles\u2019 song was so poor and then the coffin grinding to a halt. Still, Joe would have loved all that,\u201d she said. Then, gesturing to a quadrangle area: \u201cThere are a lot of flowers I think you should look at.\u201d As we walked towards where the flowers were displayed, Pinter was leaving. He nodded at us and said: \u201cI\u2019m very sorry. He was a marvellous writer.\u201d \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d my dad asked. \u201cHe said, Dad, that John was a good writer,\u201d I said, to which Dad mindlessly replied: \u201cYes, he was.\u201d This remark was typical of where we came from. Pretending to be in the know when we couldn\u2019t tell a pigeon from a pelican. The flowers, mostly white roses and carnations, had cards attached. One read: \u201cTo darling Joe from the cast of <em>Loot</em>.\u201d The card on our flowers read: \u201cFrom all in Leicester.\u201d I sidled up to Dougie. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t there a proper message on our flowers?\u201d He looked at me as if I was criticising him: \u201cI told Peggy that John wouldn\u2019t have wanted any flowers and she said she\u2019d take care of it all, so I let \u2019er.\u201d Later, she would refer to us as \u201cJoe\u2019s little family in Leicester\u201d. As we were leaving, Peggy said: \u201cJoe was very well respected, you know.\u201d I wanted to say adamantly: \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t know.\u201d But I didn\u2019t dare. Only then my sister interjected: \u201cWe\u2019re off a council estate in Leicester. Me and Leonie work in hosiery factories, Mam was a cleaner, Dad was a gardener and our Doug\u2019s a plumber. We\u2019ve got no idea where our John gorrit from, have we, Leonie?\u201d I nodded in agreement. The funeral over, I was eager to be back in Leicester.</p> <p>\u00a9 Leonie Orton</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.quirkypress.co.uk/Memoir_about.html#link3\" title=\"\"><em>I Had It in Me by Leonie Orton is published by Quirky Press (\u00a312.99)</em></a></p>",

  "<p>For someone to refer to themselves as captain three decades after they stopped playing would, on the face of it, seem a little absurd. But what if you\u2019re the captain of perhaps the greatest team of all time and, although a right-back, can lay claim to scoring the most glorious goal in the history of the World Cup \u2013 a goal that has come to embody the apotheosis of team sport?

He played in the shadow of his great friend Pel\u00e9 for club and country almost his whole career, but there was never any debate over which of them was the captain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/25/carlos-alberto-dies-brazil-captain\">Pel\u00e9 and Franz Beckenbauer lead tributes to \u2018brother\u2019 Carlos Alberto</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cEveryone in Brazil knows me as <em>O Capit\u00e3o</em>,\u201d said Carlos Alberto when I interviewed him in the Rio office of his sports marketing company three years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s just a nickname, but one that no one will ever let me forget. I\u2019m very proud of what we achieved in 1970, but so is everyone else in Brazil. It means more than football, it defined us to the rest of the world. And to be part of that is wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>I was there ostensibly to ask him how he thought Brazil would do in the upcoming World Cup, which was a few months away, but, like any football fan given an opportunity like this, all I really wanted to talk about was his 1970 dream team of Pel\u00e9, G\u00e9rson, Tost\u00e3o, Rivelino, Jairzinho et al.</p> <p>He nailed my first question, correctly, saying that the 2014 team \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the experience to win the World Cup, and we only have one world-class player, Neymar, which is rare. Normally there are a handful of Brazilians among the world\u2019s best. And playing here in Brazil \u2026 well, God help them. The pressure and media intrusion will be unbearable.\u201d</p> <p>His answer allowed me to segue swiftly into the 1970 World Cup and I asked how that team, as tournament favourites, coped with the pressure. \u201cIn one word, preparation,\u201d he said. \u201cFor four and a half months, six or seven days a week.\u201d</p> <p>Perceptions have changed in recent decades, but from Brazil\u2019s first World Cup victory in 1958 until the early 1990s, Europeans would glimpse Brazil\u2019s uniquely gifted footballers only every four years. In eulogising the joyful spontaneity of their football, a lazy stereotype was born, one that suggested such skills sprang directly from dancing the samba at Rio carnival and playing barefoot on Copacabana beach. The 1970 team were the prime candidates for this theory.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s always been bullshit,\u201d said Carlos Alberto. \u201cYes, we are a football nation with a huge population and we have a naturally beautiful way of playing, but don\u2019t think we don\u2019t take it deadly seriously. Like in US sport, winning is everything here and we work hard at it.</p> <p>\u201cWe had to change our manager just a few months before the tournament,\u201d when the increasingly erratic J\u00f5ao Saldanha was replaced by M\u00e1rio Zagallo, \u201cbut the players trusted each other totally. We gelled so well \u2013 I think that\u2019s what made our play look effortless.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd, of course, we had Pel\u00e9. We were team-mates at Santos so I knew how important he was to winning. Playing with Pel\u00e9 felt like you had God on your side.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2014/may/21/brazil-carlos-alberto-1970-brick-world-cup-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/3pckk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2095706\"            data-video-name=\"Carlos Alberto's classic World Cup goal for Brazil: brick-by-brick video animation\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/5/20/1400585055813/Carlos-Alberto-1970-wonde-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-437345390\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/5/20/1400585055813/Carlos-Alberto-1970-wonde-010.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/05/20/140520BrazilWonderGoal1970-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/05/20/140520BrazilWonderGoal1970/140520BrazilWonderGoal1970.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/05/20/140520BrazilWonderGoal1970_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/05/20/140520BrazilWonderGoal1970.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/05/20/140520BrazilWonderGoal1970_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2014/may/21/brazil-carlos-alberto-1970-brick-world-cup-video\">Carlos Alberto\u2019s classic World Cup goal for Brazil: brick-by-brick video animation</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Carlos Alberto also knew how badly his friend wanted the 1970 World Cup after being booted out of the 1966 finals by brutal Portugal defenders. Brazil had been unprepared for the physicality of the European teams and relied on the old guard that had won the 1958 and 1962 crowns. Carlos Alberto, already a star and captain of Santos, did not make the squad.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why in 1970 we didn\u2019t take any chances with preparation. Although Brazil is a poor country our sports medicine has always been excellent. Back then it was more thorough than the European teams. Every player arrived in Mexico at their absolute physical peak.\u201d</p> <p>Brazil\u2019s first real test came in the second match, against England. Early on, Francis Lee put in a couple of heavy challenges on Everaldo and the Brazilian goalkeeper, Felix, kicking the latter in the head.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the trainer was on, I said to Pel\u00e9: \u2018One of us needs to calm this guy down.\u2019 For all his skill, Pel\u00e9 could also look after himself on the field \u2013 he had to. But straight from the restart I\u2019d come up against Lee and clatter him.\u201d He raises an eyebrow and laughs: \u201cI went in a bit too hard, actually \u2013 I should have got a card for the challenge.\u201d</p> <p>It was a tense, classic encounter \u2013 \u201cA game for adults,\u201d said Zagallo \u2013 remembered for Gordon Banks\u2019s miraculous save from Pel\u00e9 and Bobby Moore\u2019s sublime tackle on Jairzinho, with Brazil winning 1-0.</p> <p>\u201cEngland were the champions and an even better team than they were in 1966, so to beat them filled us with confidence,\u201d said Carlos Alberto. \u201cCrucially, it also meant that we\u2019d win the group and stay in Guadalajara for the quarter- and semi-final, and avoid altitude problems in Mexico City. We\u2019d trained at altitude to acclimatise when we arrived in Mexico but staying that high for too long is draining. Our medical team had it all planned out. After beating England I knew we could win it.\u201d</p> <p>The team\u2019s crowning glory was his goal against Italy in the final, the fourth in a 4-1 win. He must have recounted it a thousand times but I could not leave without asking him about the goal. Would he mind retelling it one more time?</p> <p>Mind? Within seconds he had turned his desk into the Azteca stadium. He put his mobile down on the right wing: \u201cThat\u2019s me, waiting around the halfway line, while Clodoaldo is on the left doing his magic little dribble,\u201d he said, waving towards my side of the table. He then leaned over and slid my tape recorder into the penalty area: \u201cThis is Pel\u00e9 \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Sorry, but I\u2019m going to say that again, because it\u2019s the nearest I\u2019ll ever come to true greatness: Carlos Alberto is giving me a one-to-one masterclass on one of football\u2019s seminal moments and using my tape recorder as Pel\u00e9!</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d worked on the move in training. Zagallo had said that if we dragged the Italians to the left wing, then I should get forward down the right. He would send his assistant coach [Carlos Alberto Parreira, who managed Brazil to World Cup victory in 1994] to watch opposition matches and take photos with a telephoto lens.\u201d He pauses to laugh at the primitive nature of this spying mission. \u201cHe\u2019d come back and give us a slide show on his projector. But it worked. The Italians were obviously too good defensively not to track back, but we noticed that, probably because of the heat, they dropped off later in the game. This was the 85th minute and they were already beat, so I just took off.\u201d</p> <p>By the time the flowing nine-man move had reached Pel\u00e9 (aka my tape recorder) just outside the penalty area, Carlos Alberto was arriving to his right like a runaway train.</p> <p>\u201cPel\u00e9 and me played so often together that he knew where I was \u2013 I didn\u2019t need to shout. He saw me coming and rolled his pass in front of me so I didn\u2019t have to break stride.\u201d He smiled again, savouring the memory once more. \u201cAnd I caught it perfectly.\u201d</p> <p>It still stands as the ultimate captain\u2019s goal and it had been such an honour to listen to him talk about it that I had to stop myself saluting as I said goodbye.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cIn 2011,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/03/rory-stewart-interview\" title=\"\">Rory Stewart</a> writes, \u201cmy father and I decided to march the length of Hadrian\u2019s Wall together. I thought this walk would allow us to explore and answer questions about Scottish nationalism, Rome, frontiers and empires.\u201d The physical undertaking was not as straightforward as it sounds, as Stewart\u2019s father was already 89 years old, while the intellectual ambition seems vast. The plan had been for the two men to walk together for the first three miles of each day. The reality was that, after the first day or so, Stewart walked alone along sections of what he could find of the wall, while his father, travelling by car, intercepted him at agreed points along the way. There is a tension in the writing, and in the circumstance. Stewart\u2019s frustration with his father, who often found the museums \u201cboring\u201d, preferring the cafes and museum shops, contrasts starkly with Stewart\u2019s illimitable energy and encyclopedic knowledge of Roman history.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Stewart\u2019s walk across the Middleland brings Cumbria brilliantly alive</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Stewart was in his 20s he walked across Afghanistan, after which he wrote the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/06/featuresreviews.guardianreview37\" title=\"\"><em>The Places in Between</em></a>. The physical scope of <em>The Marches</em> is modest when set against Stewart\u2019s earlier enterprise, but the reality of this journey seems to have frustrated both men. When his father ambushes him by appearing unexpectedly on the path ahead of him, Stewart asks him, \u201ca little crossly, why he had thought he could find me\u201d. Another day Stewart is irritated when his father fails to meet at their rendezvous because he has gone to the nearest pub. Perhaps that is the way with parents, and we are all guilty of reverting, on occasion, to an almost childlike petulance before them. Also of a reluctance, perhaps, to take on board the fact that they are old and may find the pub more congenial than a bus stop. Despite this, Stewart bubbles with geopolitical knowledge, using the Roman occupation and the artificial border as a filter through which to examine ideas about national identity and he strives to identify exactly what it is that Scottishness, or Englishness, means.</p> <p>Sensing that his father isn\u2019t enjoying the project, Stewart suggests that they drive back to his father\u2019s house in Scotland. After this Stewart sets out alone, from his own home in Cumbria, to walk the 380 miles back to his father\u2019s house, Broich. He refers to this country, exquisitely, as the <a href=\"http://www.rorystewart.co.uk/category/the-middleland-and-marches/\" title=\"\">Middleland</a>. At this point the prose explodes. Whereas I had struggled to find a sense of place beyond the immediate fact of Hadrian\u2019s Wall, Stewart\u2019s walk across the Middleland brings Cumbria brilliantly alive. \u201cI brushed the tight purple tips of the long grass, and fingered wool, which hung like cotton candy on the slender stalks.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/03/rory-stewart-interview\">Rory Stewart: 'The secret of\u00a0modern Britain is there is no power anywhere'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stewart unpacks and explores the theory behind rewilding. He is sympathetic to the frustration of the Cumbrian farmers. Yet when he meets a man who tells him: \u201cI think the fells would look much more beautiful if they were not farmed, and were left to grow wild. The sheep do terrible damage to the wild species,\u201d Stewart\u2019s response is: \u201cI wondered why he did not live abroad\u201d, seemingly intolerant of views that contradict his own. Stewart, after all, became a Conservative MP under a government that, at one level, came to be defined by an elitism that came close to alienating the rest of the country.</p> <p>Politics aside, this is travel writing at its best. When Stewart wades across the Solway Firth, he writes: \u201cThe English shore \u2013 behind me \u2013 had begun its journey 8,000 miles away, swinging up from somewhere down by the South Pole; while the \u2018Scottish\u2019 shore drifted east, attached to what is now America. The channel beneath my feet was the point at which they met, 200 million years ago.\u201d</p> <p>The final section of the book chronicles the end of Stewart\u2019s father\u2019s life. Perhaps more than anything else, more than the exploration of a landscape, or an attempt to define the prickly concept of empire, or to ask what it means to be Scottish, <em>The Marches</em> is a portrait of a man. Of an energetic, loving father; of a gentle man, yet feisty; of a man who loved to dance and to laugh and to sing, and whose son was the apple of his eye.</p> <p><em>Katharine Norbury is the author of The Fish Ladder (Bloomsbury).

  "<p>\u201cIf I\u2019d known what the reaction was going to be, I would have drunk the milk first,\u201d says Emerson Fittipaldi, unable to prevent himself from chuckling as he recounts the incident that, even 23 years later, is recalled by many fans in the United States more clearly than his two Formula One world championships. By reaching for orange juice after winning the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2016/may/29/indianapolis-500-a-look-back-at-a-centurey-of-races-in-pictures\">Indy 500</a> in 1993 the Brazilian might have provoked rancour but he was always a singular driver and a singular character and he has no time, nor patience, for regrets after a remarkable career. Being himself was always more important to Fittipaldi and it is something he shares with and admires in Lewis Hamilton.</p> <p>The winner drinking milk after the race at Indianapolis is one of motor sport\u2019s oldest traditions, begun in 1933 after Louis Meyer celebrated his second victory with a glass. But Fittipaldi wanted to do his own thing (and doubtless help the business of the orange grove farm he owned) after taking the flag for the second of his two wins at the Brickyard. He duly swigged orange juice and was still being booed years later when driving the pace car before the opening of the 2008 race. Mentioning it now provokes gentle amusement.</p> <p>\u201cI was promoting the Brazilian orange juice,\u201d he says. \u201cI won the race and I did drink the milk, but it was after I drank the orange.

I had the best behind me, I drove for Lotus and McLaren and some of the best teams in America. How can I complain?\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton, the world champion, has received a lot of criticism for his jet-set lifestyle and interests outside F1 and their potential effect on his driving, as well attracting an aggressive media response after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/06/lewis-hamilton-f1-under-fire-snapchat-bunny-app\">the Snapchat incident in Suzuka</a>. But Fittipaldi is sympathetic. \u201cFrom all the modern drivers, Lewis has a very strong personality, which is great for motor racing,\u201d he says. \u201cHe is able to communicate with the fans and the fans like that. That\u2019s part of the sport. I like his personality, doing what he wants to do.\u201d</p> <p>He has a valid point, the complaints about over-media-trained, bland drivers have been around for years but when one strays from the script, even only at the expense of journalists expecting stories, there is a furore. Fittipaldi insists you can\u2019t have it both ways. \u201cIt\u2019s important that someone can express themselves, we need that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to give our opinion the way we want to give it.

They have to have more freedom, to express their own opinion, not just what the team or sponsors want them to say.</p> <p>\u201cThey have to express their feelings more, that\u2019s what people want to know.

The show lightly brushes against many contemporary issues: a newly awakened synth who was working in a Bolivian coal mine is said to have \u201chidden on ships and lorries\u201d to get to England. He is, in that sense, our first sci-fi refugee. God help us if the Daily Mail get hold of the story; Jack Straw will probably want to start measuring the diameter of his metal dental frame to guess just how old he really is. Gemma Chan\u2019s beguiling performance as a mopping waitress in a seaside cafe screams silently of the poor working conditions in our service industry; while a human father (Tom Goodman-Hill) getting made redundant to increase the efficiency of a small packing warehouse can\u2019t help but remind viewers of the drone-tracked ruthlessness of Amazon and its ilk.</p> <p>Which isn\u2019t to say Humans is merely earnest. The plot still gallops along like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champion_the_Wonder_Horse\">Champion the Wonder Horse</a>. Over its 45-minute running time, we see Niska inch further towards free will, while the other liberated synths run around gently rusting industrial sites looking by turns stiff and seductive. Hester, a synth from a nuclear power plant, goes rogue and narrowly avoids setting off Nottingham\u2019s own version of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident\">Three Mile Island</a>, while the inevitable star-cross\u2019d love story between synth Anita (Chan) and human-synth hybrid Leo (Colin Morgan) bounces on like a ball bearing dropped down a fire escape.</p> <p>Does Humans succeed as sci-fi? Well \u2013 in the sense that all good science fiction uses a flimsy filter of androids, aliens and fluorescent goo to stare down the U-bend of contemporary politics \u2013 yes. It examines immigration, consent, workers\u2019 rights and morality, all through the extended metaphor of robots. Sexy robots. The sort of sexy robots you\u2019d be happy to encounter on a dancefloor in Berlin.</p>",
  "<p>He was staggering towards his mum\u2019s house when the heart attack hit. It was Sunday 5 April 2009, and \u201cMighty\u201d Paul Maiden was in search of sympathy for the mystery illness he thought was flu. With his heart punching his chest at 220bpm, he grasped for a garden wall and collapsed to the pavement. Everything went black.</p> <p>At 6ft 2in with a shaved head, 19\u00bdin biceps and ham-hock forearms, Maiden was the mirror image of Popeye. At 31, he had a reputation as a fierce competitor with a splash of flamboyance \u2013 he\u2019d walk out to an MC Hammer track, dressed as a 1970s pimp, and leave with a prize. A bit like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/dennis-rodman\">Dennis Rodman</a>, only from Lancashire.</p> <p>Through a mist of blue lights and squeaking tyres, Maiden arrived at Wigan\u2019s Royal Albert Infirmary. Rigged to bleeping machines, his vital organs began to shut down. Family said their goodbyes. His condition was so rare, doctors knew of only one other case, in Canada, in 2003. That same year, Maiden placed seventh at the World Championship in Ontario \u2013 as an armwrestler. It\u2019s when doctors think he might have contracted the illness that then lay dormant until 2009.</p> <p>Another cardiac arrest. Resuscitation. Nineteen blood transfusions. A tracheotomy. A four-week induced coma. Yet somehow Maiden survived. In many ways, the sport saved him. Without his superheavyweight frame, able to withstand 25kg of weight loss, he\u2019d have died. Maiden\u2019s closest rivals were among the visitors, with wife Alex reciting online prayers from Sweden, Mexico, Alaska and beyond, as sons Max, four, and Paul Jr, three, innocently tugged the wires that kept him alive. When he finally woke, Maiden lifted his right arm and burst into tears. \u201cThis can\u2019t be mine,\u201d he sobbed. \u201cI came in with a 20in python, and I\u2019m looking at a lolly stick.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7eb131b4ba1a1a398450deaa98a15396bd2bdc86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7eb131b4ba1a1a398450deaa98a15396bd2bdc86/0_283_6940_4164/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Mighty\u2019 Paul Maiden in a t-shirt, his muscle-bound tattooed forearms crossed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I used to chalk my hands four hours before a competition, because I was so up for it: \u2018Mighty\u2019 Paul Maiden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob Kepler/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His armwrestling career should have been over. Besides the muscular atrophy, Maiden had a lifetime prescription for flecainide acetate to aid his irregular pulse. His left arm \u2013 that had won three British Championships (his right had won five) \u2013 was 20% disabled. He left hospital in a wheelchair. But while his muscle had abandoned him, his hunger remained.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people said I could just sit on disability for the rest of my life, but that\u2019s not me,\u201d he said when I met him early this year. \u201cI came out of hospital weak as a kitten, and picked up my missus\u2019s 4kg dumbbells. I couldn\u2019t even shoulder press them \u2013 I was that feeble. But those 4kg became six, and then eight, then 10. I thought, you know what? I\u2019m gonna armwrestle again.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When he woke from his coma, Maiden lifted his feeble right arm and burst into tears</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a shoebox gym, tucked behind a house in Blackburn, three men violently grunt. The first official armwrestling contest took place in 1955, in the smoke-stained back room of a bar in Petaluma, California, and legend says the sport can be traced to an Egyptian cave painting. Yet to modern pullers (as armwrestlers are known), this is their Vatican City. A hexagonal sign screwed to the varnished door reads \u201cThe Freakshop: here comes the pain\u201d, and inside Paul Maiden has just grimaced through 35 pull-ups on the \u201cbastard bars\u201d. Sweating alongside him is Freakshop founder Neil \u201cSupernatural\u201d Pickup, a multiple world champion, British Armwrestling Federation president and Maiden\u2019s co-trainer, and Tom \u201cLean Machine\u201d Holland, a gifted 24-year-old who Pickup likens to \u201ca honey badger\u201d.</p> <p>Now 38, with cropped hair and inky explosions covering his lean physique, Maiden is gearing up for the sternest test since his miraculous recovery: the <a href=\"http://www.walunderground.com/\">World Armwrestling League</a> (WAL) final in Las Vegas. Just 14 months after he left hospital, he achieved right-hand bronze at the 2010 British Championship, and he has won every year since. But the WAL represents a new dawn. Where once pullers would fly to far-flung destinations on their own dime, to compete for a cheap cup and a pat on the back, WAL promises the glamour of ESPN broadcast rights, $10,000 in crisp notes to the victor and a chance to prove yourself against the sport\u2019s most hulking luminaries. For Maiden, the lure lies not in money \u2013 he cites \u00a3220 Prada trainers as his biggest regret (\u201cThey were no better than the Lacoste ones I\u2019d bought from JD Sports\u201d) \u2013 but prestige.</p> <p>\u201cOther people are motivated by pennies, I\u2019m not,\u201d he pants, gulping cherry-coloured amino acids from a gallon bottle. \u201cMoney\u2019s money.

If he wasn\u2019t riding bikes around Leigh as a kid, he was playing rugby or cricket, or sparring with his elderly neighbour, an RAF veteran. Bullied at school and plagued by random panic attacks, he strived to replicate Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s frame from <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076578/\"><em>Pumping Iron</em></a>, skipping school for gym sessions. Collecting his GCSEs, Maiden ripped the envelope and tossed away the shreds without looking inside. Then he went to play tennis.</p> <p>Though he longed to be like his hero Sylvester Stallone in the cheesy 80s armwrestling movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093692/\"><em>Over the Top</em></a>, Maiden didn\u2019t get his fix until the age of 20, when his promising rugby career was wrecked by a drunk driver\u2019s car bonnet, which left him with nerve damage in his lower back. Having won a pub competition, he began to master the moves (the hook, top roll, hit) and endured the unique rite of passage known as \u201cachy breaky\u201d \u2013 a relentless burn that\u2019s \u201clike toothache in your tendons\u201d. Within a year Maiden turned pro, and in 2003 honeymooned on the Isle of Man \u2013 to compete in a tournament.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m not motivated by pennies. Money\u2019s money, but arm wrestling is an addiction</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the Freakshop, pullers massage Voltarol into their joints before tackling custom-built equipment. Veins pulse as a crippling weight is dragged upwards, a sort of bicep curl that replicates a defensive armwrestling move. Watching on with a knowing grin, Pickup offers words of encouragement to Holland and Maiden. At 42, with a slight bulge around the middle, he hopes to coach the pair to victory in Vegas. Pre-illness, Pickup remembers Maiden as \u201cthe class clown\u201d. While Maiden\u2019s resolve has sharpened since his comeback, so has his sense of humour. \u201cHe came back as Jim Carrey,\u201d Pickup admits. \u201cFor a few years it was like training with Ace Ventura.\u201d</p> <p>One Saturday in March, just off the A6 in Garstang, Europe\u2019s foremost arm benders congregate at a hotel most commonly used for weddings. The UK scene is growing \u2013 with the arrival of WAL, and Pickup\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.armwars.com/\"><em>Arm Wars</em></a> federation having aired on Sky Sports and Eurosport \u2013 yet funding remains scarce. Here at the WAL superqualifier, men and women cluster on the wooden dancefloor, hoping to seal their Vegas berth.</p> <p>Edging out Joseph Lovei, a smirking Bond villain who plays dirty, Tom Holland weeps upon winning the lightweight final. Paul Maiden, holstering his right limb in a Union Jack arm-warmer, squares off against Swede Niklas \u201cSteel Giraffe\u201d Nannestad, who looks more like a crane fly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0f21170ea15d371fd10e7dd22ddd35a5c31db5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0f21170ea15d371fd10e7dd22ddd35a5c31db5b/0_248_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Up-and-coming Tom \u2018Lean Machine\u2019 Holland, who trains with the Slough Slammers in Berkshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arms race: up-and-coming Tom \u2018Lean Machine\u2019 Holland, who trains with the Slough Slammers in Berkshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob Kepler/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The match unspools into an energy-sapping war, Maiden and Nannestad turning deep maroon before the Giraffe finally prevails.

He\u2019s not going to Vegas.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An arm break sounds like a bundle of sticks breaking over your knee</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Two miles away from the glamorous Las Vegas Strip, the Orleans Hotel, with its $28 all-day buffet and frumpy waitresses, is a dusty Sin City relic. Behind a black curtain in the Mardi Gras ballroom, past the chandeliers, magic-eye carpet and vomit-coloured walls, it morphs into Madison Square Garden. Dense stands overlook a bustling pit, with three armwrestling tables trailed by roving cameras. As busty promo girls totter through crowds distributing protein drinks, the seminar portion of \u201cthe biggest weekend in armwrestling history\u201d gets under way, like a Ted conference for gym rats. On stage, weather-beaten puller Craig \u201cThe Fury\u201d Tullier (who hails from Louisiana and calls the sport \u201crasslin\u201d) describes how bone fragments once shredded his ulnar nerve, leaving a knot in his arm like balled-up paper. Head ref Bart Wood explains that an arm break \u201csounds like a bundle of sticks breaking over your knee\u201d.</p> <p>Then, through the swirl of pullers and fans slurping Muscle Monster drinks, Paul Maiden appears. Like that day on the Lancashire concrete, fate smiled on Maiden \u2013 WAL offered him a wildcard spot. He is gaunt and wrinkled, having cut water and carbs to weigh in at 88.3kg. He proudly informs me that for the past fortnight he has abstained from sex. \u201cThere have been times where I\u2019d chalk my hands up four hours before a competition, because I\u2019m so up for it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now I\u2019m trying a couple of new things, to see if it makes a difference.\u201d</p> <p>The next morning, Maiden snaps awake at 4am. He chews on some peanuts and drinks Vitargo carb powder mixed with water, to help swell the 9kg he packed on since yesterday. Maiden gives thanks to God \u2013 he\u2019s not a church-goer, but believes something mightier than medicine saved him from death \u2013 then spends 15 minutes meditating. Breathing deeply, he visualises himself at the table, opposite his enemy. He doesn\u2019t allow himself to picture a win, but does see his arm lifted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40f2dbc28a99c0e5ed1f5b15673c4c98e65d267b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40f2dbc28a99c0e5ed1f5b15673c4c98e65d267b/0_396_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fight night: Matt \u2018Iron Horse\u2019 Mask takes down his opponent at the Orleans, Las Vegas, June 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fight night: Matt \u2018Iron Horse\u2019 Mask takes down his opponent at the Orleans, Las Vegas, June 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob Kepler/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the Orleans, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/20/nickelback-queensland-australia-wanted-poster-facebook\">Nickelback</a> track booms from speakers, the air thick with Deep Heat, heavy-duty aftershave and plumes of chalk. \u201cI feel sick,\u201d says Kirsty, Maiden\u2019s 28-year-old girlfriend (he and his wife separated in 2009), as pullers\u2019 names are called bingo-style and up to three matches ensue at once. Maiden sips coffee, listening to a single hardcore track on loop and bouncing from foot to foot, before locking up against Bill Ballinger, a tubby, spectacle-wearing puller who looks more IT technician than athlete. Maiden wins but suffers a shock defeat to Daniel Mosier, a big-muscled ironworker with a blond goatee, who crushes Maiden\u2019s hand like a hydraulic press. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t strong,\u201d Maiden growls, \u201cI got caught napping.\u201d With double elimination rules, he is still alive, but only one more loss before death.</p> <p>Composure gathered, Maiden roars to victory against Darryl Baideme, before a punishing duel versus hirsute New Yorker Brandon Ellesor. Maiden squeaks to victory, regaining enough showmanship to gyrate his backside to a TV camera, but during the pull bangs his right thumb violently against the table. An x-ray will later reveal ligament damage and, as the next bout is called, against arm-wrestling stalwart Mike \u201cThe Chemist\u201d Selearis, it has already begun to swell.</p> <p>A teacher from Connecticut whose facial hair verges on art, Selearis approaches the table with his mammoth right arm raised, bald head aglow under the lights. Last year\u2019s runner-up on his left arm, Selearis shakes non-competing hands with Maiden, and they wish each other good luck.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"981f18fbb84de5c8fd43dcd399efbfce5bec6bbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/981f18fbb84de5c8fd43dcd399efbfce5bec6bbc/0_0_4674_6918/676.jpg\" alt=\"Craig \u2018The Fury\u2019 Tullier flexes his huge arm muscles and roars\" width=\"676\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Craig \u2018The Fury\u2019 Tullier, whose ulnar nerve was once shredded by bone fragments.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob Kepler/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both men place their elbows on a pad as the referee negotiates a fair grip, their left hands clutching the table pegs. The ref barks \u201cGO!\u201d and their hands slither apart. A strap is produced. It is looped, pulled through and fastened, but Maiden looks concerned. He wants the strap tight and low on his wrist, to lever his arm and apply force against Selearis. But, as the ref releases his hands, Selearis employs the same tactic, scalding Maiden\u2019s engorged thumb. In one motion he rotates his wrist, rolls sideways and drives Maiden to the mat. It is a controlled explosion. Maiden blinks slowly, nods and graciously pats Selearis on the hand. \u201cWell done, pal,\u201d he says. \u201cWell done.\u201d</p> <p>Having finished ninth, it\u2019s not long before Maiden is back on duty as armwrestling\u2019s resident jester. He drowns out \u201cU-S-A\u201d chants with booming renditions of \u201cEng-er-land\u201d, cider in hand. Neil Pickup has seen this before. He recalls Maiden\u2019s anguish at placing third at the 2010 British Championship, the first stop in his extraordinary comeback tour, as it was he who beat Maiden to the trophy. \u201cI saw the pain and upset in his eyes,\u201d says Pickup. \u201cAll that desire, all that want, all that effort \u2013 he thought it was written in the stars that day. He took it on the chin, said \u2018Congratulations mate,\u2019 but he was filling up.\u201d</p> <p>A few weeks LATER, I find Maiden in a philosophical mood. He\u2019d have loved to have conquered WAL but knows his war was won long ago. \u201cI now value life, I know it can be snatched away at any moment,\u201d he says. \u201cI do feel like my best years were robbed, and I was bitter for a while, but these days I\u2019m just thankful to be alive.\u201d Maiden\u2019s story isn\u2019t over. He swears he\u2019ll be world champion one day. He\u2019s had visions \u2013 of his arm being lifted \u2013 and vows to stage an open-bus tour through Leigh to celebrate. Sometimes, like \u201cMighty\u201d Paul Maiden, the human spirit cannot be killed.</p>",
  "<p>In 1967 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/kenneth-macmillan\">Kenneth MacMillan</a> choreographed a one-act ballet for the Deutsche Oper Ballet in Berlin, of which he was then director. The piece was about an unidentified woman who claimed to be the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Anastasia_Nikolaevna_of_Russia#/media/File:Grand_Duchess_Anastasia_Nikolaevna_Crisco_edit_letters_removed.jpg\">Grand Duchess Anastasia</a>, who had somehow escaped the brutal murder of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/aug/27/great-dynasties-romanovs-ian-sansom\">Romanov royal family</a> by the Bolsheviks in 1918. The ballet, set in a mental asylum, was a starkly expressionist work set to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/mar/27/bohuslav-martinu-czech-composer\">Martin\u016f</a>\u2019s <em>Fantaisies Symphoniques</em>. By 1971, MacMillan was director of the Royal Ballet, and decided to expand the piece to full-evening length, adding two acts to precede the earlier one. The new acts, set to Tchaikovsky\u2019s first and third symphonies, were more conventionally balletic in style, and represented memories of Anastasia\u2019s life. As to whether these memories were real or false, and whether the woman (who had taken the name Anna Anderson, apparently at random) was indeed Anastasia, the ballet did not commit itself.</p> <p>Anderson died in 1984, and 10 years later, DNA tests proved to the satisfaction of all but the most determined believers that she had been an impostor. This put a fresh complexion on MacMillan\u2019s ballet, already viewed as something of an anomaly (following its hostile reception in 1971, the choreographer suffered a nervous breakdown). Today, the piece remains a flawed and fascinating oddity, perhaps more revealing of its creator than of its ostensible subject.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Osipova prowls the asylum like a sleepwalker, her tread as agonised as if she\u2019s walking on broken glass</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/anastasia-by-kenneth-macmillan\"><em>Anastasia</em></a> opens in 1914, on the imperial yacht, the Standart. Anna Anderson (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/natalia-osipova\">Natalia Osipova</a>) enters in her austere grey asylum dress, flitting among the royal family and the smartly uniformed naval officers. The scene resolves itself. Anderson is now Anastasia, the youngest of the Romanov sisters. The officers dance and entertain the young people; the act ends with news of impending war. Osipova is engaging as the 13-year-old Anastasia, but her wide-eyed, soubrette charm looks forced. Her sisters, danced with nicely judged restraint by <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/olivia-cowley\">Olivia Cowley</a>, <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/beatriz-stix-brunell\">Beatriz Stix-Brunell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/yasmine-naghdi\">Yasmine Naghdi</a>, are much more convincingly regal. Stix-Brunell\u2019s Tatiana is notably excellent; she carries herself with the serene certainty of one who knows that the world will shape itself to accommodate her every wish. A bitter irony, given the end that awaits her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92e0e6f5fc31566a58cf26543a0984dbeca29dda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92e0e6f5fc31566a58cf26543a0984dbeca29dda/0_0_3997_2708/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yasmine Naghdi, Beatriz Stix-Brunell, Olivia Cowley and Natalia Osipova as the Romanov sisters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yasmine Naghdi, Beatriz Stix-Brunell, Olivia Cowley and Natalia Osipova as the Romanov sisters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problem with this opening act is that it goes nowhere. We\u2019re becalmed, like the royal yacht, and in this context Osipova\u2019s over-emphatic display is understandable. She\u2019s dancing the title role, the choreography is banal, and she\u2019s trying to make things happen. Act 2 transports us to Petrograd, three years later. At a ball to celebrate Anastasia\u2019s society debut, with courtiers and officers costumed in autumnal shades of buff and russet (implausibly, they wear their caps and shakos on the dancefloor), the ballerina Mathilde Kschessinska (<a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/marianela-nunez\">Marianela Nu\u00f1ez</a>) is giving a performance with her partner (<a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/federico-bonelli\">Federico Bonelli</a>).</p> <p>Nu\u00f1ez dispatches the sequence with her customary elan, and the atmosphere is charged by the fact that Kschessinska was once the tsar\u2019s mistress. This prompts a miniature ballet of embarrassment, with Tsar Nicholas (Christopher Saunders) shifting uneasily in his seat, the young grand duchesses exchanging complicit glances and pressing the hands of the stony-faced Tsarina Alexandra (<a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/christina-arestis\">Christina Arestis</a>), and Rasputin (<a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/thiago-soares\">Thiago Soares</a>) looking on with baleful calculation. This is the kind of detail at which the Royal excels, and it animates what is essentially a dull tranche of exposition.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMkAEqyNmhk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GMkAEqyNmhk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMkAEqyNmhk\">Anastasia is live in cinemas on 2 November.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The presence of Rasputin, who by 1917 had been dead for a year, reminds us that we are still spectators of Anastasia\u2019s memories, and that these memories are unreliable. The distortion of time and place is echoed in Bob Crowley\u2019s design, with its obliquely angled chandeliers and ambiguous architecture. Anastasia\u2019s point of view, and the ballet\u2019s internal logic, are both abandoned when we visit a revolutionary camp in the city and witness the storming of the palace. It\u2019s a rushed and creaky end to an act that, although lit by fine individual performances, among them <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/vincenzo-di-primo\">Vincenzo Di Primo</a>\u2019s fierce young revolutionary, is as dramatically inert as the first.</p> <p>With Act 3, however, everything changes. This is MacMillan at his darkest and most thrilling, and Osipova meets the work\u2019s challenge with authority. As the Martin\u016f score fractures and splinters, and snatches of old film flicker on the walls, she prowls the asylum like a sleepwalker, her tread as agonised as if she\u2019s walking on broken glass. Assailed by images of her family\u2019s murder, she twitches like a marionette, her coordination dissolving. \u201cWho am I?\u201d she asks, and MacMillan seems to echo her question.

These have tantalising properties that could support life as we know it, but in its extremes \u2013 extreme cold, extreme dehydration or extreme radiation.

So I have my scepticism that it would actually come to pass.</p> <p><strong>Should we go back to the moon first?</strong><br>I think we should remind ourselves how to go to the moon, but I think Mars is vastly more interesting, biologically, because it has evidence of liquid, running water \u2013 it\u2019s had water for billions of years. I\u2019ve always wanted to keep Mars in our sights, even if we do choose to go back to the moon.</p> <p><strong>Would you go to Mars?</strong><br>I would, but only after the person who made the spaceship had sent their mother first!

We would never have left the cave were it not for folks such as that.</p> <p><strong>Who is going to get to Mars first: Musk? Bezos? Nasa? Boeing? China?</strong><br>By my read of history, the only thing that will get to Mars first is a government-driven space programme, such as Nasa. And why? Because it has never been done before, not with people \u2013 it is expensive and it has unquantified risks. When all three of those are operating there is no business model that you can establish. I think what is much more likely to unfold is the government wants to go to Mars, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/06/the-guardian-view-on-space-exploration-the-final-frontier\" title=\"\">SpaceX </a>and other companies want to build the spaceship and Nasa pays them for it.

Your gripe is with the 40% of the electorate that wants to vote for him. That\u2019s who you should be talking to.

  "<p><strong><a href=\"http://rileysfishshack.com/\">Riley\u2019s Fish Shack</a>, King Edward\u2019s Bay, Tynemouth. Meal for two including drinks and service: \u00a345. No bookings</strong></p> <p>Call off the search. Close down the web browser and put away the guide books. I have found the eating experience of the year. It\u2019s the sort of place that people mumble irritatingly about to each other, in a way that makes it sound like some tiresome gastronomic Shangri-La; honey-toned and utterly unobtainable. We roll our eyes at such stories. We assume that the experience is better in the retelling than in the reality, its virtues amplified by the efforts some might have to make to get there. Lunch always tastes better when it comes glazed with struggle.</p> <p>To be fair some of this may apply to Riley\u2019s Fish Shack. It\u2019s on the beach at King Edward\u2019s Bay, half an hour\u2019s drive from Newcastle. It really is hidden. The sat nav took me to a shopping street in Tynemouth. We parked up and wandered to the front. There, we looked down over the Edwardian railings and the vertiginous shoreline to the shack. We knew it was the place. There was a film-fun-style cartoon of a fish skeleton on the roof, the motif repeated across all the deckchairs out front. A wisp of smoke pirouetted from its Hobbit chimney on the roof. We started our descent.</p> <p>The shack belongs to Adam Riley, who did some of his training on the Isle of Man, before moving to the north east to work with his father\u2019s theatre company. He shifted sideways into street food, and for two years ran a mobile fish cart on the beach.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is a Boden photoshoot brought to life. It is every boho, middle-class food fantasy made real. And it\u2019s fantastic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The knackered cart is still parked up on the sand in front of the \u201cshack\u201d, in truth two full side-access shipping containers, those sides opened out to form the balcony floor. It\u2019s then been fitted out steampunk-style in a mixture of dark wood and artfully rusted steel. The balcony out front has a narrow counter so you can sit on hardwood stools and look out over the beach, under cover of yellow tarpaulins. Industrial-scale trawlers bob and turn far out on the bay, the result of a shipping bankruptcy a few months back.</p> <p>Alternatively, if the weather is keeping to type, there\u2019s some basic seating inside, behind sliding glass doors. They need them. This being the north east, Riley\u2019s don\u2019t do anything as feeble as seasonal opening. The shack is open all year round. If you want to fit in, wear a T-shirt in December. Most of the inside space, however, is taken up by a wood-fired oven, squatting like a giant red-backed ladybird, its flame-filled mouth open to the door, plus a long grill.</p> <p>The menu is short and based around a handful of virtues. They have that oven. They have fish. They have crisp-roasted garlicky potatoes. They have a killer bread recipe, for use as flatbreads and for casings of what they call empanadas, but you can call pasties. They have crunchy salads. Adam has a beard and a woolly cap. All of these things are essential. The food is served in thin wooden boxes, with wooden disposable knives and forks. It is messy. It is so, so good.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa8301a72ed5d3b4d0e9b17401bdd176af232961\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa8301a72ed5d3b4d0e9b17401bdd176af232961/0_1224_10328_6198/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Still smoking delicately in the box\u2019: mackerel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Still smoking delicately in the box\u2019: mackerel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Telfer/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two fat fillets of fresh mackerel, seared on the grill until the skin is blackened and bubbled, come on piles of those dark, crisped potatoes, with both a fennel and a green salad and a freshly made, lightly charred flatbread, still smoking delicately in the box. There is a spiced tomato relish, and a bolshie smear of salsa verde to lend the necessary high acidic notes. Tear off a piece of bread, break up the fish and shove one inside the other. It costs \u00a37.50.</p> <p>At twice the price there are fillets of plaice, so white and virginal the Vatican would probably write them a glowing letter of recommendation. They are cooked <em>en papillote</em> in the oven, with squared-off boiled potatoes, nutty-brown shrimps, samphire and mussels still in the shell, so that they produces their own limpid broth. It is the pristine quality of fish cookery you always hope to find in one of those fancy, raised pinkie finger London places, but rarely do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17340ee82196674f8fc99d45a66e95b6af560888\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17340ee82196674f8fc99d45a66e95b6af560888/1456_1232_7843_4707/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Big bready triangles so chunky you could sleep on them\u2019: empanadas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Big bready triangles so chunky you could sleep on them\u2019: empanadas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Telfer/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Skewers of squid, big ones with thick tentacles that once put work in, have been shown the grill just long enough to char without allowing them to seize up. Then there are the empanadas, big bready triangles so chunky you could sleep on them if you were short of bedding. One hides a mess of long-stewed beef and oysters, cooked down to a tangle of animal with the sweet, happy funk of the bivalve. The other is spiced salmon, like the best Thai fish cake, breathing hot aromatics over you with each bite. Yours for \u00a34 each, \u00a310 for three.</p> <p>There is a short wine list priced between \u00a316.50 and \u00a325, and a bit of craft beer. Music, involving double basses, heartache and vocals sung by men with names like Brad or Thorsten, roars across the beach as if calling to the abandoned trawlers out on the North Sea. We sit at the outside counter, scarved and coated against the early autumn bluster, fork away boxes of terrific fish cookery and watch children in wellies running between the deckchairs on the beach, artfully placed around fire pits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5d88a9fd921ff4df1b2af5d3a53518d14f37dcf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5d88a9fd921ff4df1b2af5d3a53518d14f37dcf/0_0_10328_6338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Thick tentacles that once put work in\u2019: chargrilled squid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"614\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Thick tentacles that once put work in\u2019: chargrilled squid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Telfer/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Quickly it strikes us: this is a Boden catalogue photoshoot, brought to life. It is every boho, middle-class food fantasy made real. And you know what: it\u2019s bloody fantastic. The food is a minor miracle given the circumstances, the price achingly reasonable, and the setting utterly perfect. Oh, my dear, sweet darlings, I think I\u2019m in love.</p> <p>There are some pre-packaged brownies available on the bar, and coffee, but to secure them you will have to join the queue again, and as the afternoon or evening draws on that can become lengthy. My advice is to work off some of those roasties by climbing back up the cliff to the high street. A little way down on a corner, you will find <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/garethjameschocolatier/\">Gareth James Chocolatier</a>. The coffee is good and they supply the brownies sold at Riley\u2019s. The salted caramel version is thick and fudgy.</p> <p>Better still, get a few of their domed salted caramel chocolates which are as good as any I\u2019ve tried anywhere. The tempered chocolate shell is crisp; the liquid centre is that perfect balance of sweet to salt. And suddenly, like those chocolates, I\u2019m gushing all over again. But that\u2019s the way it is.

As Amnesty International recently made plain, the mistreatment of people for a political purpose is torture.</p> <p>\u201cIt runs contrary to international law and our obligations under the refugee convention. The government should have been aware of this, but of course they have just run the solicitor general out of office.\u201d</p> <p>The One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, welcomed the government\u2019s proposal, tweeting: \u201cGood to see that it looks like the government is now taking its cues from One Nation.
