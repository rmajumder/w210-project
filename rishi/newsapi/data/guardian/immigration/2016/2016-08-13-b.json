  "<p>Gary Johnson \u2013 the Republican-leaning, marijuana-smoking, Everest-climbing presidential nominee of the Libertarian party \u2013 has a problem: he will be barred from crucial election TV debates this autumn unless he can boost his polling numbers to 15%, from around 10% now.</p> <p>Without the blockbuster ratings that the three scheduled Clinton-Trump dust-ups are likely to produce, many say it\u2019s hard to see how Johnson, 63, or either of the two other third-party candidates \u2013 Jill Stein of the Green party and Evan McMullin, a former CIA officer and policy director for the House Republican Conference \u2013 can ever be anything more than electoral curiosities.</p> <p>But other commentators suggest that the emergence of three independent candidates could still provide an unpredictable twist. Polling data suggests libertarians on both sides of the political divide are giving independent candidates a second look.</p> <p>In Las Vegas on Friday, Johnson and Stein spoke before a gathering of Asian-American and Pacific islander voters to press their case. Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico who presents a platform of social libertarianism, fiscal conservatism and non-interventionism in foreign affairs, reasoned at the gathering that in this, \u201cthe craziest election of all time\u201d, one indication of the craziness was that \u201cI might be the next president of the United States\u201d.</p> <p>A just-released <em>Wall Street Journal</em>-NBC poll gives Johnson 15% in the crucial swing state of Colorado, and Stein 6%. Johnson said he had been asked repeatedly if a vote for him, or any third-party candidate, was a wasted vote. \u201cA wasted vote is voting for somebody you don\u2019t believe in. That\u2019s a wasted vote,\u201d Johnson said in Vegas. \u201cVote for the person you believe in \u2013 that\u2019s how you bring about change.\u201d</p> <p>Stein, who also spoke at the event, similarly argued that many Americans were looking for an alternative to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, whom she described as \u201cthe most disliked and untrusted\u201d major-party nominee in US history. \u201cDemocracy needs a moral compass,\u201d she told the meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about who you don\u2019t like the most or who you are most afraid of.\u201d</p> <p>Stein, who was also the Green party candidate in 2012, has outlined policy positions that include a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d focused on renewable energy jobs and on completing America\u2019s transition to renewable energy by 2030. She also proposes to cut the military budget by a third and the creation of regional food systems based on sustainable organic agriculture.</p> <p>On the Republican side, McMullin, a beneficiary of the #Never Trump movement, missed getting on the ballot in 26 states before he had even sent out his first campaign release.</p> <p>Despite this, he gives disaffected conservatives an alternative to the Republican nominee, who, he says, has tapped into \u201cpeople\u2019s darkest prejudices and deepest fears\u201d.</p> <p>McMullin\u2019s best chance would be if Trump were to drop out of the race for some as-yet-unanticipated reason. \u201cLike millions of Americans, I had hoped this year would bring us better nominees who, despite party differences, could offer compelling visions of a better future,\u201d McMullin said. \u201cInstead, we have been left with two candidates who are fundamentally unfit for the profound responsibilities they seek.\u201d</p> <p>But can they begin to make a difference? Only once in recent election cycles has a third party candidate had any influence: that was in 1992, when Texan businessman Ross Perot took almost 18.9% of the vote and helped to hand the election to Arkansas governor Bill Clinton over what could have been a straightforward re-election for George HW Bush.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s running mate, former Massachusetts governor William Weld, said he had seen interest and fundraising pick up as Trump\u2019s campaign has floundered. Johnson\u2019s campaign recently reported a $1m one-week fundraising haul and has said that more than 40,000 people have pledged to donate at least $15 to his campaign on 15 August.</p> <p>With Clinton now leading Trump by double digits in some key battleground states, the impact of any third party candidate could be limited. But given the unpredictability of the race so far, and the probability that Johnson and Stein will pull more voters from Clinton than Trump, all that could change. \u201cAt the moment it doesn\u2019t look like they can have much impact at all,\u201d says veteran Democratic adviser Hank Sheinkopf. \u201cBut if the race gets closer, they could throw it either way.\u201d</p> <p>Sheinkopf believes the election has become more about personalities and less about what party leaders want. The long-term impact may be a significant shift in how people view Democrats and Republicans. As it now stands, Stein, Johnson and McMullin could act as a convenient parking spot for voters disgusted with both candidates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63dbf15c211ee27d4c60466f991c563d9f98c8e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63dbf15c211ee27d4c60466f991c563d9f98c8e1/0_62_3010_1806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ross Perot in 1992\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The last third-party candidate to significantly affect a US presidential election was businessman Ross Perot in 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earlier this month, federal judge Rosemary Collyer rejected a challenge brought by Johnson and Stein arguing that the bar for inclusion in debates is set artificially high. Yet there are signs that the ground could be shifting. Former Clinton press secretary Mike McCurry, now co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates, hinted that a third podium might be needed. \u201cSome of our production people may have said: \u2018<a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Just in case, you need to plan out what that might look like\u2019</a>,\u2019\u2019 McCurry told Politico. \u201cWe won\u2019t know the number of invitations we extend until mid-September.\u201d</p> <p>Ron Faucheux, president of Clarus Research Group, a non-partisan polling firm, said: \u201cPolls show that voters think third party candidates should be included, and in an election like this where polls show a majority of voters dislike both main party candidates, there is a good reason to give them the opportunity to at least look at other options.\u201d</p> <p>But even Johnson and Stein remain somewhat wistful about their prospects, casting themselves as agents of change who, at best, could represent the beginning of a political realignment among voters dissatisfied with a two-party system.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest message is \u2018consider us\u2019, as a very, very viable alternative to this two-party system that has become so polarised that they\u2019re not able to do anything,\u201d Johnson has said.</p> <p>In Vegas, Stein advanced a similar position: \u201cWe\u2019re having a political reorganisation in this election because the Republicans are kind of falling apart, and the Democrats have kind of split, with a lot of the Bernie Sanders supporters just not happy with the alternative.\u201d She noted that it was by voting for the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d that the country had inherited many of its problems.</p> <p>When recent polls are expanded to include all four candidates, rather than just the main two, most show a smaller lead for Clinton over Trump and in the others the margins remain similar.</p> <p>Johnson accepted that his polling was thus far insufficient to qualify for the debates and his chances of making an impact were remote unless he could take part in the debates.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to win the presidency if I\u2019m not in the presidential debates,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI do believe anything is possible given that, right now, arguably the two most polarising figures in American politics today are running for office.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Towards the end of the 100-minute service at St Luke\u2019s in Birmingham on a sunny Sunday morning, Taryn Nabi began to shake uncontrollably. Near her, a man fell to his knees with head bowed and arms outstretched. Several people wept; some embraced.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t explain it.

Now, according to priest-in-charge Tim Hughes, it regularly attracts a total of 500 people to its two Sunday services, which are characterised by loud rock music, chatty homilies rather than formal sermons, group prayer, and manifestations of God in the form of shaking or speaking in tongues.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/18/evangelical-christians-social-action-revivify-church-brand\">How evangelical Christians are using social action to revivify church brand | Andrew Brown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before moving to Birmingham, Hughes, 39, and his wife Rachel spent 10 years at Holy Trinity Brompton, an ultra-evangelical church in west London known almost universally as HTB, which pioneered the famed <a href=\"http://uk.alpha.org/\">Alpha courses</a> and where Hughes was director of worship. The Hughes and their four children were joined by two dozen other members in relocating to Birmingham to establish St Luke\u2019s as a \u201cchurch plant\u201d. Members of the congregation are encouraged to commit to regular attendance and financial support by standing order.</p> <p>St Luke\u2019s is not unique. In July, Rich and Louise Grant and their two sons moved from Sheffield to \u201cplant\u201d a new church at <a href=\"http://saintgeorgeschurch.org.uk/\">St George\u2019s in Gateshead</a> in partnership with HTB. Twenty other members \u2013 all younger than the thirtysomething Grants \u2013 are relocating to Gateshead ahead of the 25 September opening of the church, which aims to attract the city\u2019s student population.</p> <p>Alex and Liz Wood moved this summer from an HTB outpost in Brighton to Portsmouth to \u201cplant\u201d a church in a former department store in the city centre, assisted by part of a Church of England grant. Of \u00a3929,000, \u00a3179,000 is for the Harbour church and \u00a3750,000 for other evangelism projects.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.harbourchurchportsmouth.org/2/Our-Story\">Harbour church\u2019s mission statement</a> is: \u201cTo play our part in the evangelisation of the nation, the revitalisation of the church and the transformation of society.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.stmplymouth.org.uk/\">St Matthias in Plymouth</a>, led by Olly and Ali Ryder, formerly of HTB, will launch in September, with its first Alpha course kicking off three days after the church opens. Evangelical churches have also been \u201cplanted\u201d in Norwich, Lincoln and Bournemouth. All have strong links with HTB, all are led by husband-and-wife teams, and all are aimed principally at students and young families. \u201cWe want to connect with 18-30s,\u201d said Hughes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we only present the gospel in one particular way to one particular generation, people will vote with their feet</p> <footer> <cite>Ric Thorpe, bishop of Islington</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ric Thorpe, another former HTB man who was appointed as bishop of Islington with special responsibility for \u201cchurch planting\u201d last September, aims to have 100 new worshipping communities in London by 2020. \u201cThere is a need to plant churches in new places to reach new people in new ways,\u201d he said.</p> <p>That the Church of England needs to reach new people is beyond question. The scale of its institutional atrophy was graphically illustrated by data earlier this year showing that church attendance was set to continue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/17/church-of-england-attendance-decline-30-years-general-assembly\">falling for another 30 years</a>. Today\u2019s figure of 18 people per 1,000 regularly attending church would drop to 10 per 1,000, with an 81-year-old eight times more likely to go to church than a 21-year-old.</p> <p>In an attempt to stem this apparently inexorable decline, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has launched the church\u2019s biggest evangelism drive in a generation, with the goal of a religious revival among young people who are less likely than any other age group to identify themselves as Christians.</p> <p>Welby, himself a former HTB man who was prepared for ordination by Sandy Millar, HTB\u2019s vicar until 2005, is optimistic that his drive will succeed. \u201cI think the tide is turning in this country. We are seeing many churches growing,\u201d he told Michael Gove in an <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/12/the-tide-is-turning-in-this-country-justin-welby-interviewed/\">interview in the <em>Spectator</em></a> last December. In March, he told an evangelical gathering: \u201cI believe from the bottom of my heart that the long years of winter in the church, especially in the Church of England, are changing. The ice is thawing, the spring is coming.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c17e26cb9c3fccd86c5f349397c257472cb81bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c17e26cb9c3fccd86c5f349397c257472cb81bb/0_81_2345_1407/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Macgregor/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Church insiders say that, of those in contention to succeed Rowan Williams as archbishop of Canterbury in 2013, Welby alone grasped the scale of the church\u2019s decline and the need for decisive action if it was not to wither away. Since his appointment he has focused the church\u2019s energy and resources on an ambitious <a href=\"https://www.churchofengland.org/renewal-reform.aspx\">Renewal and Reform</a> programme to refashion it as an outward-facing evangelistic \u201cmission\u201d rather than an institution sliding gently into its dotage.</p> <p>A third of the way through his expected 10-year term at the church\u2019s helm, Welby faces a critical few years. \u201cWe have a golden window to change the church,\u201d one evangelical bishop told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cIf we can\u2019t turn it round in that time, it\u2019s over.\u201d</p> <p>Some see parallels with Tony Blair\u2019s mission in the 1990s to drag the Labour party into the modern age. Except, say critics, rather than taking the church into the mainstream, as Blair did with Labour, the focus on evangelism risks placing the church firmly on the fringe, in the hands of zealots. Many among the clergy and in congregations are uncomfortable and distrustful of charismatic practices such as speaking in tongues. There is also a belief that the established church of the country should be broad and inclusive \u2013 even if that means a little fuzzy \u2013 rather than narrow and uncompromising.</p> <p>\u201cActually, the more apt comparison is with Corbyn and Momentum,\u201d said one critic. \u201cThe diehards become more and more frenzied, while everyone else looks on in total incomprehension \u2013 and in many cases are repulsed.\u201d</p> <p>With regard to church planting, advocates point to astonishing numbers. <a href=\"http://stpetersbrighton.org/\">St Peter\u2019s Brighton</a>, which started five years ago with 30 people, now claims to be 800-strong. <a href=\"http://www.stn.org.uk/\">St Thomas Norwich</a> holds five services on Sundays, and has grown from 50 to 450 attendees in two years. <a href=\"http://kxc.org.uk/\">KXC</a>, a church launched in 2010 in King\u2019s Cross, London, has 500 regular worshippers, nearly all in their 20s, says Thorpe.</p> <p>He drew a rough graph, showing the downward trajectory of the traditional congregation and the upward trajectory of the \u201cgrowing church\u201d. \u201cThe evidence suggests that the institutional church is in decline. But you have these two things happening at the same time: an ageing way of doing church is becoming less popular, but there\u2019s a new movement of young people particularly in situations of growth. If you draw those curves together, there will be a bottoming out,\u201d he said. Critics say attendance figures at new churches rarely represent genuine new growth, but are largely due to \u201csheep stealing\u201d \u2013 poaching existing members of other congregations \u2013 and attracting students looking for a new place to worship after leaving their \u201chome church\u201d. They also claim that the congregations of church plants do not reflect the demographics of their inner-city locations, but are overwhelmingly white, middle-class young professionals.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The ways in which [evangelicals] talk about God are fundamentally offputting. More people are turned off than turned on</p> <footer> <cite>Martyn Percy, dean of Christ Church, Oxford</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Although it may appear to be a grassroots phenomenon, church planting is a key part of Welby\u2019s strategy \u2013 and gets generous support. The allocation of church funds is a crucial way of effecting change in an institution whose running costs are about \u00a31bn a year (much of it going to cover its vast pensions liability). According to a senior source, \u201cmoney used to be handed over on a formulaic basis, and the dioceses could spend it how they liked. And the formula was perverse \u2013 if [church] attendances fell, you got more money. It was the wrong incentive structure.\u201d</p> <p>From January next year, funding will be allocated to two streams. One will go to poor areas, mostly deprived inner cities; the other for \u201cstrategic development\u201d, with church planting taking centre stage.</p> <p>Ric Thorpe said: \u201cWhat\u2019s changed is that [the church] is now saying, we want this money to go towards growth \u2013 which, when it\u2019s in decline, is a wise investment. In this new thinking, you\u2019ve got to demonstrate that you\u2019ve got a plan, that you\u2019re putting [funding] to good use, that it\u2019s not going to something that\u2019s dying. There\u2019s an urgency about this.\u201d</p> <p>He says small rural churches have a higher number of clergy per capita than dense, urban parishes. \u201cWhere the population is denser, there are fewer clergy around to reach those people. If we are an outward-facing church we need to position people where they\u2019re most needed: 83% of people live in urban areas, but 83% of [church] finance doesn\u2019t go there. But it should.\u201d</p> <p>The church, he said, needed to help some rural parishes \u201cface reality\u201d. Some of those parishes, historically the backbone of the Anglican church, are wincing in pain. Another key plank of the Renewal and Reform programme is the goal of recruiting 6,000 priests over the next 15 years, to be \u201cthe leadership of the church in the 2030s, 40s and 50s\u201d, says the church\u2019s secretary general, William Nye.</p> <p>About 70% of those selected for ordination are reported to be evangelicals, a figure likely to increase. Some study at <a href=\"https://www.stmellitus.org/\">St Mellitus College</a>, an HTB-inspired ordinand training centre based in London with outposts elsewhere in the UK, which is the fastest-growing ordinand college in England. St Mellitus had nine students in its first year, 2007. Last year the number was 215.</p> <p>\u201cSt Mellitus is training in a new way, with a new ethos,\u201d said Graham Tomlin, its president and the bishop of Kensington. Ordinands are attracted by its \u201clively, energetic, can-do, positive atmosphere\u201d, he added. Not all students were from an HTB background, but HTB\u2019s missional approach was central to college life. \u201cFifty or 100 years ago, it didn\u2019t matter what you did as a priest, people came to church anyway,\u201d said Tomlin. \u201cNow we need the kind of people who can build an outward-looking church with energy and vision.\u201d</p> <p>Tomlin and Thorpe are part of a cohort of bishops and key officials driving the church in an evangelical direction. They include Chris Russell, Welby\u2019s adviser on \u201cevangelism and witness\u201d. Evangelism and evangelicalism were different, he pointed out; people from any tradition in the church could evangelise; but evangelicals insist on the Bible as the sole authority. Nevertheless, the church\u2019s most ardent evangelists appear to be evangelicals.</p> <p>According to Ian Paul, a member of the Archbishops\u2019 Council, the church\u2019s central executive body, there is a \u201cformidable representation of evangelicals\u201d among bishops, \u201cone without precedent in modern times\u201d. Listing 18 (out of 42) dioceses with evangelical bishops, <a href=\"http://www.psephizo.com/life-ministry/are-evangelicals-taking-over-the-church/\">Paul wrote in the <em>Church Times</em></a> in February: \u201cThe large number of evangelical bishops is just the episcopal tip of an ecclesiastical iceberg.\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone was happy with this. \u201cLiberals might worry about a threat to the \u2018broad church\u2019; conservative evangelicals will wonder why it remains so broad,\u201d wrote Paul.</p> <p>Some in the broad middle feel marooned and neglected by the scale and pace of reform. Martyn Percy, the dean of Christ Church Oxford, and one of the most outspoken critics of Renewal and Reform, said Welby had a \u201cgroup of very loyal lieutenants around him, but a lot of people in the church feel we\u2019ve become exiles in our own institution\u201d. The church, he said, was in the grip of a \u201csmall group of elite organisationally minded evangelicals who think the church is a biddable, shapeable, governable body, and that\u2019s not the case. The reality is complex, messy, knotty.\u201d</p> <p>Much of the talk of \u201cbeing stronger and fitter for the 21st century is simply not believed by most people. All indices show there\u2019s no growth, and a lot of the ways in which [evangelicals] talk about God is fundamentally offputting. More people are turned off than turned on.\u201d</p> <p>The church was \u201can institution, based on values and existing independently of the popularity of those values\u201d, not an organisation that could be remodelled and relaunched. \u201cWe need to love and cherish the institution, and growth may come, or it may not,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Robert Cotton, rector of Holy Trinity Guildford and a member of the Archbishops\u2019 Council until earlier this year, said there was \u201can increasing disconnect between the rhetoric of the overall [Renewal and Reform] programme, and the ministry we do in the parishes. I\u2019m fully behind Justin wanting to do something about the health of the church, but I\u2019m not sure the language, the rhetoric, of Renewal and Reform is connecting with the sort of experience I have as a parish priest.\u201d</p> <p>The emphasis on growth in membership left him uneasy, he said. \u201cMembership is not the language that I and those that live in the soggy middle of the CofE often use. Of course we want more people to come to church, but I don\u2019t think of the church essentially as a membership organisation.\u201d</p> <p>Evangelical churches expected a degree of commitment that many people felt unable to give, said Cotton. \u201cThe C of E for centuries has seen itself as a church serving the whole nation \u2013 the religious enthusiasts as well as those who are unable to demonstrate that sort of enthusiasm, but still take the moral life, the life of good character, the life of community service very seriously. And the church for years has wanted to value and nourish those people even if they can\u2019t sign up to every article of the creed. The danger is that if we become too much a membership church, we\u2019re actually shrinking our connection with the country.\u201d</p> <p>But, said Thorpe, the bishop for church planting, the status quo was not an option. \u201cIf you\u2019re stuck in the past, you will decline because effectively you\u2019re locking yourself into a certain way of doing things, and everyone else moves on \u2026 I want to see the traditions of the church continue and be honoured and celebrated \u2013 and for us to infuse some of the best things of those traditions into current worship practice.</p> <p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want [tradition] to be a god in its own right, that we can\u2019t change, because then the church will never change and adapt. One of the roles of the church is to present the message of the gospel to each generation. If we only present it in one particular way, to one particular generation, people will vote with their feet.\u201d</p> <h2>BROAD CHURCH: THE MAIN ANGLICAN DIVISIONS</h2> <p><strong>Anglo-Catholics</strong></p> <p>The sacraments are central. Services are characterised by the wearing of vestments, incense, bell ringing and silent prayer. Many opposed the ordination of women and the appointment of women bishops, and resist liberalisation of the stand on gay marriage. Some have left for the Roman Catholic church.</p> <p><strong>Traditionalists</strong></p> <p>Probably the largest (if least vocal) grouping. They believe in God, Queen and country \u2013 and a church presence in every town and village. They form the congregations of many traditional parish churches, and are the backbone of the Women\u2019s Institute, Mothers\u2019 Union and other Middle England institutions. Think Vicar of Dibley and the local church fete.</p> <p><strong>Liberals</strong></p> <p>Believe the church must be responsive to the world. The gospel can be \u2013 and has to be - reinterpreted for changing circumstances if the church is to be relevant to society. Women and gay clergy are embraced. Church of England liberals tend to be active in social action schemes and interfaith projects. God is green \u2013 and occasionally female.</p> <p><strong>Evangelicals</strong></p> <p>The authority of the bible is paramount and, for some, not open to reinterpretation. Evangelicals seek a direct and personal relationship with God. Worship is characterised by rock music, swaying and arm waving, hugging \u2013 and, for \u201ccharismatic evangelicals\u201d, speaking in tongues or possession by the Holy Spirit. Conservative evangelicals are biblical fundamentalists, but many British evangelicals \u2013 represented by Holy Trinity Brompton and the popular Alpha courses \u2013 appear more inclusive, although they are still theologically conservative.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 August 2016 to clarify the proportion of a Church of England grant allocated to the Harbour church in Portsmouth. <br></p>",

Nested within this is the childhood memory of being told to go and play in the fresh air, essentially because your parents or teachers wanted five minutes free of your company.

Take a leaf out of Owen Smith\u2019s book: last weekend saw him on Twitter posting a selfie taken after a swim at the London Fields Lido in Hackney, somewhat daringly given the prevailing political wind in north London. But while the heat is on the street, better that the hot air on Twitter should cool down, and everyone calm down, with some soothing pictures of animals having a paddle; it\u2019s not called the silly season for nothing.

  "<p>It is a sprawling fantasy featuring deformed humans, superheroes who can read minds and fly, and plot lines exploring issues such as bigotry and raw political ambition. Like the blockbuster TV hit <em>Game of Thrones</em>, it is also based in part on the work of the cult fantasy writer George RR Martin.</p> <p>Now Hollywood is betting that a major TV adaptation of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/08/wild-cards-george-rr-martin-tv-adaptation\">Wild Cards</a></em>, a series of science fiction books grounded in gritty realism that Martin began writing 30 years ago, can emulate the extraordinary worldwide success of the HBO show. If it does, it will fulfil the dreams of Martin\u2019s collaborator on <em>Wild Cards</em>, Melinda Snodgrass, who has struggled in vain for 12 years to interest film and television producers.</p> <p>The US writer and editor was praised by executives, only to be given excuses about why the books were not for them. She refused to be bowed by rejection and her determination has finally paid off. She is now heading an ambitious TV adaption of the series backed by Universal Pictures. </p> <p>The phenomenal global success of <em>Game of Thrones</em> got the industry\u2019s attention, and Snodgrass has no doubt that it paved the way for the new show. She told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cIt\u2019s been crucial. The success of <em>Game of Thrones</em> and George have really helped. People now see the possibilities in this other major work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7754e534688b2594e15f6562054d7e6e830dcfa8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7754e534688b2594e15f6562054d7e6e830dcfa8/0_0_1138_1422/800.jpg\" alt=\"Author Melinda Snodgrass\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melinda Snodgrass has collaborated on Wild Cards with George RR Martin for 30 years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Wild Cards</em> imagines a world that was intentionally infected by an alien virus in 1946. Ninety per cent of those infected die. Of the remaining 10%, most are deformed (called Jokers) and 1% (called Aces) get superpowers, from flight to mind-reading, which they use for both good and evil.</p> <p>The characters include the Sleeper, whose DNA-changing virus has enabled him to go without sleep for months on end. When he does sleep, he can wake up with a completely new face and new powers. Snodgrass said: \u201cIt is a superhero franchise, but it\u2019s different in that it\u2019s far more realistic than some superhero films, and grittier. If you die in the <em>Wild Cards</em> books, you don\u2019t get to come back. We want death to have consequences.\u201d</p> <p>The books also offer analogies for our times. Through the Jokers, for example, they explore persecution and bigotry. \u201cEntertainment works best when it reflects what\u2019s happening in the real world and when it allows people to reflect on it, perhaps in a safer space where it doesn\u2019t feel so charged,\u201d said Snodgrass.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>George and I created Wild Cards, and then invited a bunch of writers to come play in the sandbox</p> <footer> <cite>Melinda Snodgrass</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She added that some of the stories mirror real life: \u201cIt\u2019s not just about superheroes fighting super villains. We have political thrillers, with one about an unfit candidate trying to obtain the highest office in the US, for example. Most of it is set in the US, but we try to look at world issues. Interestingly enough, one of our books predicted the rise of a caliphate before Isis actually arose.\u201d</p> <p>While Martin and Snodgrass have each written some of the books, they have built up a consortium of about 30 authors, all creating stories set in the same world.</p> <p>The first book was published in 1986, 10 years before Martin\u2019s first <em>Game of Thrones </em>book in 1996. Such is the series\u2019 popularity that the 23rd volume will be released later this month, and Martin and Snodgrass are already working on the next three. Beyond publication worldwide, the books have inspired spin-off comics and games.</p> <p>An announcement that <em>Wild Cards </em>is to be developed with Universal Cable Productions was made last week by Martin, who said that \u201cthere are thousands of stories to be told\u201d.</p> <p>As he has an exclusive development deal with HBO, he has handed <em>Wild Cards</em> to Snodgrass and producer Gregory Noveck: \u201cThey know and love the <em>Wild Cards</em> universe almost as well as I do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>They hope to begin shooting next year. \u201cIt is very exciting. George and I created <em>Wild Cards</em>, and then invited a bunch of writers to come play in the sandbox. Then it\u2019s just grown and grown,\u201d said Snodgrass. Her passion for fantasy and science fiction began as a child, lapping up books by JRR Tolkien and watching <em>Star Trek</em>. \u201cI wanted to go to the stars.\u201d</p> <p>That passion never left her. She gave up a legal career to become a writer and was a story editor and executive script consultant on <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>. Like Martin, she lives in New Mexico, where she trains horses and rides them in competition. Her latest science fiction novel, <em>The High Ground</em>, has just been published by Titan Books.</p> <p>She says she had always seen the screen potential of <em>Wild Cards</em>. The emphasis was always the emotional content, dialogue and \u201ccharacters with whom people can identify and care about, even if you may hate them\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>One of Britain\u2019s senior theologians has warned that the Church of England is in danger of becoming a narrow sect \u201cdriven by mission-minded middle managers\u201d who are alienating clergy, congregations and the general public.</p> <p>Martyn Percy, dean of Christ Church, Oxford, writes in the afterword of his latest book, The Future Shapes of Anglicanism<em>, </em>that church leaders\u2019 strategy is moving towards \u201ccentralised management, organisational apparatus and the kind of creeping concerns that might consume an emerging suburban sectarianism, instead of a national church\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/19/archbishop-of-canterbury-syrian-family-refugee-sponsorship-scheme\">Archbishop of Canterbury takes in Syrian refugee family</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His far-reaching criticism comes as the Church of England presses ahead with a major reform programme, which includes diverting funds away from struggling rural parishes \u2013 traditionally its backbone \u2013 to new evangelical churches in city centres.</p> <p>Other controversial elements of the Renewal and Reform programme include MBA-style management courses for bishops and other senior officials, the identification and fast-tracking of talented young clergy into leadership positions, and an emphasis on \u201cchurch planting\u201d \u2013 the establishment of new urban churches directed at young families and students.</p> <p>The programme is an attempt by Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, and other leading figures to reverse the church\u2019s dramatic decline. Forecasts earlier this year suggested numbers attending Church of England services regularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/17/church-of-england-attendance-decline-30-years-general-assembly\">would continue to fall for another 30 years</a> to about 1% of the population.</p> <p>Renewal and Reform has created discord within the church, although a motion welcoming the programme was overwhelmingly carried at last month\u2019s synod in York. But some critics claim there is little room for substantial debate on the programme.</p> <p>According to Percy, the strategy is fundamentally flawed. \u201cIt will take more to save the Church of England than a blend of the latest management theory, secular sorcery with statistics and evangelical up-speak,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>A cure for the ailing church \u201cwould require a much deeper ecclesial comprehension than the present leadership currently exhibit \u2026 There seems to be no sagacity, serious science or spiritual substance to the curatives being offered.\u201d</p> <p>Rather, he says, the church \u201cis being slowly kettled into becoming a suburban sect, corralling its congregations, controlling its clergy and centralising its communication. Instead of being a local, dispersed, national institution, it is becoming a bureaucratic organisation, managing its ministry and mission \u2013 in a manner that is hierarchically scripted.\u201d</p> <p>Bishops are forced to operate like area managers, with targets set by headquarters rather than by spiritual pastors. He writes that the archbishop, a former oil industry executive, \u201chas set about reforming and renewing the Church of England with a zeal and zest more usually associated with secular management consultants\u201d.</p> <p>Percy says those who declare themselves to be non-religious \u201cwill not be won over to return to the church by increasingly organisational, theologically narrow and vogueish sectarian expressions of faith\u201d. Instead there needed to be \u201ca broad church \u2013 capacious and generous\u201d. Narrow Anglicanism \u201cis almost a contradiction in terms. It is the breadth that defines Anglican polity. And it is the breadth that will save it.\u201d</p> <p>Arun Arora, the church\u2019s director of communications, defended the programme, saying it would take time to turn around attendance figures. \u201cThe most recent British Social Attitudes Survey is an indication that some of the initial changes rooted in the Reform and Renewal programme may be bearing fruit,\u201d he said. \u201cAny analysis that suggests there is no need for change or fails to meaningfully engage in any plans for growth simply ignores the issues at hand. Renewal and Reform is less about management and more how we learn to better serve God and neighbour. As the debate on church growth continues, the Church of England lives out its faith through the loving actions of its people. Whether it be feeding the hungry, providing shelter for the homeless, visiting the sick, befriending the lonely, welcoming the stranger or educating the young. Any analysis that presumes our first intention is self-preservation is fundamentally flawed as we faithfully worship God and serve our neighbours in every place.\u201d</p> <p>Percy claims his scepticism is shared by a largely silent majority in an increasingly evangelical church. Although few are as outspoken as the dean in their criticism, others have also expressed disquiet over the programme.</p> <p>Robert Cotton, rector of Holy Trinity Guildford, said: \u201cI\u2019m fully behind [Welby] wanting to do something about the health of the church, but I\u2019m not sure the language, the rhetoric, of Renewal and Reform is connecting with the sort of experience I have as a parish priest.\u201d</p> <p>Wyn Beynon, a priest in charge of five Worcestershire parishes, told last month\u2019s synod debate on Renewal and Reform that the issue of pastoral care was \u201cnot present in that narrative in a clear enough way to satisfy me\u201d.</p> <p>He criticised the \u201crather disastrous illusion of leadership that has enchanted our discussion for so long\u201d, and described as nonsense a report produced for the church by Lord Green, a former chairman of HSBC, two years ago on \u201ctalent management for future leaders\u201d.</p>",

The Community Shield has been and gone, and the meaningless rigmarole of pre-season has been well and truly left behind. This afternoon\u2019s pick of Premier League matches are not, from the outside looking in, exactly gourmet dishes as such but just wait a minute. OK, perhaps it\u2019s not the most mouthwatering fixture but Burnley v Swansea City is at least a chance to hear Sean Dyche\u2019s pre-historic touchline roar all over again, and Swansea have <em>the</em> Fernando Llorente now for goodness sake. As for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/11/swansea-city-complete-deal-atletico-madrid-borja-baston\">record signing Borja Bast\u00f3n,</a> he\u2019s unlikely to feature. Everton host Tottenham Hotspur in the Ronald Koeman derby, which will either be a tantalising thriller or the polar opposite. Elsewhere, Stoke City travel to Middlesbrough, and Claude Puel and Walter Mazzarri go head-to-head in their first games on English soil. The action on the south coast is guaranteed to be more exciting than the post-match interviews at St Mary\u2019s anyway. And, last but not least, there\u2019s Crystal Palace\u2019s last-ditch, on-the-pitch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/22/crystal-palace-bid-west-brom-saido-berahino\">pursuit of West Brom\u2019s striker Saido Berahino,</a> which is worth keeping an eye on alone, even if it\u2019s destined to be last on Match of the Day. <br></p> <p>Out of breath already? Into the Championship, it\u2019s going to be a humdinger there as well today. Walter Zenga\u2019s Wolves take on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/01/jaap-stam-player-talks-dressing-room-good-manager-reading-alex-ferguson\">Jaap Stam\u2019s Reading</a> \u2013 it still feels weird saying that. Aston Villa host Rotherham in search of their first win since February. New season, new captain and Tommy Elphick pulled up outside Villa Park on Friday night to drum up some scary entrance music in a bid to turnaround their fortunes. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AVFCOfficial/status/764400559080235008\">No, really.</a> Another Midlands club, Birmingham City, travel to Leeds United and Newcastle United take on Huddersfield Town at St James\u2019 Park. <br></p> <p>There\u2019s plenty of action in League One and League Two too. AFC Wimbledon host Bolton Wanderers, which would have been literally impossible only a few years ago while Charlton Athletic could badly do with a win at home to Northampton Town. In the fourth-tier, Plymouth Argyle have made an almighty trip to Carlisle United and in-form Yeovil Town are dangerously close to the luminous orange shambles that is Luton Airport, as Darren Way\u2019s side take on Nathan Jones\u2019s Luton Town. <br></p> <p>So, it\u2019s almost a full programme in England and there\u2019s Scottish Premiership action too.

One of the men was holding up his arms as he walked, and blood was running off his arms.\u201d<br></p> <p>Upon reaching the police station, one of the refugees collapsed unconscious, prompting one officer to attempt CPR. The refugee was then carried into a police 4WD and taken to Lorengau hospital.</p> <p>Later, he was transferred back to the detention centre.</p> <p>Freelance photojournalist Matthew Abbott, who was on the island working for GetUp, and Daniel Webb, director of legal advocacy with the Human Rights Law Centre, witnessed the aftermath of the assault.</p> <p>Abbott shot photos of the men, but was accosted by police and others as he tried to take more pictures of the incident.<br></p> <p>\u201cOne policeman kept trying to put his hand in front of the camera, and outside another man kept shoving me.

Abbott retained the photos.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very tense, they were very angry, but we tried to be respectful, while explaining that I was doing my job taking photos. They actually said to us at one point \u2018what you do now will determine whether you are ever allowed to visit PNG again\u2019,\u201d Abbott said.</p> <p>After being questioned for more than two hours, and forced to supply their passport details, Abbott and Webb were released, but were made to return to the police station the next morning, before they were able to leave Manus Island.</p> <p>Guardian Australia understands that three refugees, all Afghan Hazaras who have been granted refugee status after fleeing the Taliban in their home country, had been on the beach at Lorengau on Wednesday afternoon. </p> <p>One of the men had bought multivitamins at the Lorengau pharmacy but knew the tablets would be confiscated back at the detention centre.

The Australian government can\u2019t keep sticking its head in the sand and pretending everything is fine. The only viable and humane way forward is to bring them here.\u201d</p> <p>Matthew Phillips, human rights director with GetUp, said the violence Abbott and Webb witnessed was \u201cthe grave danger the Turnbull government\u2019s abusive policy of offshore detention places people in on a daily basis\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPeter Dutton must take responsibility, acknowledge this clear danger, stop blaming other people and end the detention of the men, women and children detained on Manus Island and Nauru.\u201d</p> <p>Calls to PNG police by the Guardian on Saturday were not answered.</p> <p>The assault is reflective of a growing tension on Manus over the refugees\u2019 continued presence on the island, and the government\u2019s faltering efforts to resettle people elsewhere in the country.</p> <p>Following the PNG supreme court judgment in April that the men\u2019s detention on Manus Island was illegal and unconstitutional, the 854 men held there have been given limited rights to leave the detention centre.</p> <p>They cannot leave of their own volition (the detention centre is housed within a military base), but are allowed to catch daily buses to Lorengau, the main town, a 45-minute drive away.</p> <p>However, many of the men refuse to leave the detention centre because they fear being attacked.</p> <p>While many Manussians are accepting and welcoming of the refugees, there remains significant hostility, often violent, towards the refugees from some locals.

Weeks earlier, the European commission had unveiled an extra \u00a371m of humanitarian funding for emergency projects to help the 57,000 refugees stranded in official government camps throughout Greece.</p> <p>One volunteer serving at the Softex camp, which holds 1,400 mostly Syrian refugees, alleged that some young girls had been effectively groomed by male gangs. He said an Iraqi family had to be moved to emergency accommodation outside the camp after their daughter was attacked.</p> <p>\u201cThe parents are still in disbelief over what happened. A man from one of the \u2018mafia\u2019 groups asked their seven-year-old daughter into their tent to play games on his phone and then zipped up the tent. She came back with marks on her arms and neck. Later the girl described how she was sexually abused. It has scarred a seven-year-old child for life,\u201d said the volunteer, who asked to remain anonymous.</p> <p>Family members, he said, were so demoralised they were planning to abandon their dream of resettling in Europe and return to the country they had fled.</p> <p>Leader of the Lib Dems Tim Farron joined calls for the British government to honour its pledges by immediately rescuing vulnerable minors who are eligible to be in the UK, saying: \u201cIf Theresa May does not act now, she will not only be shaming her government but shaming the country.\u201d</p> <p>Anita Dullard of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said there had been a rise in incidents of sexual violence in Greece\u2019s refugee camps and that they had alerted the government.</p> <p>She said they had been forwarding alleged incidents of sexual violence against women and children to the UN.</p> <p>Anna Chiara Nava of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in Thessaloniki confirmed that they had heard allegations of children being victims of sexual violence. Nava said they were in regular contact with at least 10 women from the Softex camp who had complained of sexual violence and explained that many occupants, including children, were too afraid to speak out.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for the unaccompanied minors \u2013 16- and 17-years-olds \u2013 to survive. It\u2019s the survival of the fittest in there. In the evening and night it\u2019s impossible to find them [children] because they are hiding in the tents. The women are afraid. They complain that during the night and evening they cannot go to the toilet alone. They have all heard of reports of others being attacked,,\u201d said Nava.</p> <p>The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees confirmed it had raised concerns with the Greek authorities. It said: \u201cIt is an issue when it comes to Softex and others. UNHCR has been raising concerns about this, specifically about this issue [sexual violence], saying that we don\u2019t think it will be safe for women and for children. We\u2019ve raised the issue of security again and again. This is a problem; it\u2019s under discussion.\u201d</p> <p>The government coordinator for the refugee crisis, Giorgos Kyritsis, said: \u201cSoftex is the camp with the most cases of small criminal behaviour but there was not any case of rape reported to the camp\u2019s staff.\u201d</p> <p>Of the people in Softex, 60% are believed to be Syrian, of whom around 170 are thought to be children.</p> <p>A pressing issue for the British government is determining how many of the children are eligible to claim asylum in the UK. Under a clause in the EU\u2019s Dublin regulation covering asylum claims, refugees who have close family members in a particular country can claim asylum there. In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/02/child-refugees-calais-failed-by-britain\" title=\"\">refugee camp at Calais, </a>for instance, 150 minors out of 600 are eligible. In addition, the government promised three months ago to house unaccompanied minors stranded in Greece, Italy and France under the Dublin amendment, with charities under the impression that homes would be found for several thousand.</p> <p>Despite this, around 20 of the estimated 88,000 unaccompanied child refugees in Europe have so far arrived into the UK under the scheme, prompting fierce criticism.</p> <p>Cooper said: \u201cThe UK government needs to urgently wake up to its responsibility. Parliament passed the amendment exactly because we were worried about child refugees being exploited, trafficked and sexually abused because other countries were overwhelmed with the scale of the problem.\u201d</p>",

The final transport was a tangy sweet explosion of a raspberry souffl\u00e9 with raspberry ripple ice-cream (\u00a38). See what I mean about foodie waffler?</p> <p>These treats were from an ample dinner menu (and an extensive, if pricey, wine list) with an adventurous spirit. It\u2019s food that revels in its blend of traditional and unconventional: for lunch I have <em>labneh</em> cheese, Moroccan <em>bric</em> pastry and heritage tomatoes (\u00a39). It is served in what is essentially a savoury ice-cream cone on a pesto sauce, and it is subtle and velvety with a zesty kick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e019c103f9ae8b251f7fa383b714663fd5d74ffb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e019c103f9ae8b251f7fa383b714663fd5d74ffb/1_236_1166_700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dish of labneh cheese, Moroccan bric pastry and heritage tomatoes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cone home \u2026 dish of <em>labneh</em> cheese, Moroccan <em>bric</em> pastry and heritage tomatoes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Hull/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The kitchen is overseen by Michelin-starred chef Michael Bedford \u2013 an indication of the ambition and quality on offer throughout the Painswick Hotel, which extends to many generous-size rooms, with their stacks of books and harmonious mix of country house and industrial-chic decor.

The house dates from the late 18th century and has seen service as a vicarage, a family home and, until 2015, the Cotswolds 88 hotel. The little book of all the answers (Google) tells me that it is designed in late-Palladian style.</p> <p>After a year-long renovation, the hotel reopened as the Painswick in late May and is now part of the Calcot collection, which includes nearby properties Calcot Manor, Barnsley House and The Village Pub, along with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/nov/21/lord-crewe-arms-county-durham-hotel-review\">Lord Crewe Arms in Blanchland</a>, Northumberland.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8d2906d7b855f5888ba5c072a6981893350aba2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8d2906d7b855f5888ba5c072a6981893350aba2/0_135_1152_691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior shot of The Painswick Hotel and Restaurant, Painswick, Cotswolds\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sturdy stone \u2026 the hotel\u2019s late-Palladian stylings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Hull/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My room, Whitchurch Silk, at the top of the house is a gem. Not only because it is large but because it is the kind you can relax in (note: some of the \u201ccomfy\u201d doubles are a little on the cosier side). I don\u2019t feel I have to laze in the communal areas \u2013 as welcoming as the Hearth and the colourful bar area may be. While I could sit on the two-seater sofa near the bed and listen to the radio, I opt to read in one of the mid-century-design armchairs, while intermittently looking out at the rolling hills and thinking writerly thoughts \u2026 such as what time is dinner? (It\u2019s from 7pm.)</p> <p>Post-lunch guilt prompts me to make a move, and not in the car to Stroud (15 minutes) or Cheltenham (30 minutes). Instead, I walk around the village and the beautiful grounds of St Mary\u2019s, its parish church, and then in the direction of <a href=\"http://www.rococogarden.org.uk/\">Painswick Rococo Garden</a> (pub quiz gold: it\u2019s the country\u2019s sole surviving complete rococo garden). I could do more, such as explore some of <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/cotswold-way\">the Cotswold Way</a>, the 102-mile footpath that\u2019s close to the hotel. But I don\u2019t have the right boots, and I did mention dinner was from 7pm?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2644411fd2813908da98ec97d3dcf885a7dca62a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2644411fd2813908da98ec97d3dcf885a7dca62a/0_205_5258_3155/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shot of the bar at The Painswick with its illuminated drink selection behind the counter and bar stools in front.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bright spot \u2026 the bar at The Painswick</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Mackinnon Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Painswick\u2019s owners see the hotel as \u201can affordable splash of luxury\u201d.

But, with double rooms starting at \u00a3119 and breakfast extra (full English \u00a311, continental \u00a36), the bill, if you throw in an evening meal blitz, will be closer to the luxury than the affordable end of the scale.

  "<p>When wallpaper designer Deborah Bowness moved to Hastings from London seven years ago, she didn\u2019t expect to be working from a deserted ballroom on the seafront. \u201cIt was decayed glamour, battered and worn, with huge windows that looked out on to the sea. I was there for six months,\u201d she says, sitting in a deckchair outside her beach chalet. \u201cIn London, I worked in a garage with no natural light, so to have an empty ballroom felt ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>Bowness, known for her hand-printed wallpaper featuring trompe l\u2019oeil bookshelves, lamps and dresses, is one of the many artists, designers and furniture traders who have flocked to Hastings and nearby St Leonards in recent years. \u201cThere is a proper creative community here,\u201d she says. \u201cI now work on an industrial estate, and there\u2019s all sorts going on there: a vintage engineer with beautiful motorbikes, and two set designers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0209a6caeb7a06ed89317c4cf7bd7e495a4d6784\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0209a6caeb7a06ed89317c4cf7bd7e495a4d6784/228_217_3141_4541/692.jpg\" alt=\"Wallpaper designer Deborah Bowness moved from London to a former ballroom near the seafront, and on to an industrial estate \u2018with a proper creative community\u2019.\" width=\"692\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wallpaper designer Deborah Bowness moved from London to a former ballroom near the seafront, and on to an industrial estate \u2018with a proper creative community\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hastings was the place to be in the 1960s and 70s, with the likes of the Rolling Stones, the Kinks and Jimi Hendrix performing on the old pier. But years of neglect in the following decades left it a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/21/english-seaside-towns-deprivation\">depressed seaside town</a> with high levels of deprivation. The arrival of contemporary art hotspot the <a href=\"http://www.jerwoodgallery.org/\">Jerwood Gallery</a>, in 2012, and the unveiling of the pier in April (after a \u00a314.2m revamp following a fire) have both boosted the creative credentials of the town, which has been nicknamed Shoreditch-on-Sea. Along with other coastal towns such as Margate, Whitstable and Leigh-on-Sea, it is fast developing a reputation as a more affordable alternative to London and Brighton.</p> <p>The pier, the redevelopment of which was part-crowdfunded, features a sleek contemporary cafe and terrace, and there are plans for open-air screenings. In the Old Town there is also an artisan brewery at the historic <a href=\"http://www.thefilo.co.uk/\">First In Last Out pub</a> and an organic bakery, Judges, run by a co-founder of chocolate company Green &amp; Black\u2019s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69d7ca2c0da0698c7641cf74941fc6114c694026\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69d7ca2c0da0698c7641cf74941fc6114c694026/0_0_3136_4311/727.jpg\" alt=\"Homewares store Dyke & Dean, housed in the town\u2019s former local newspaper printworks.\" width=\"727\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homewares store Dyke &amp; Dean, housed in the town\u2019s former local newspaper printworks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Designer and Hastings resident Louise Body recommended the town to Bowness, who was sick of the capital\u2019s relentless noise and expense. Body, from Reigate in Surrey, has been in Hastings for a decade. \u201cIt feels like Brighton did 20 or 30 years ago,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to run a creative business here, because everything\u2019s quite cheap.\u201d</p> <p>Edward Dyke and Oliver Dean met at Central Saint Martins design school in London in 2006. Together they run homeware store Dyke &amp; Dean in a historic area south of the station known as the America Ground. Their shop is in a grand Victorian building that used to house the printers of the Hastings and St Leonards Observer newspaper (it is now printed in Portsmouth). Their own lighting collection, which they sell alongside other homewares, is so popular they have had to move their workshop to the same industrial estate as Bowness. The pair have another store in Berlin, a pop-up shop in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross<a href=\"http://www.dykeanddean.com/pages/designjunction\"> </a>and are in talks to launch in New York. Design has always had ambitions in Hastings, says Dyke: \u201cThis building was based on one in St Mark\u2019s Square in Venice.\u201d</p> <p>While Dyke grew up in nearby Rye and now lives in Hastings, Dean lives in east London, where he manages the online business and commutes regularly to the shop \u2013 an hour and a half from Charing Cross. \u201cDragon Bar, a bistro on the high street, has a sister restaurant in Shoreditch,\u201d says Dean. \u201cWhen I came here, I thought: I know I can spend some time here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5ece21d99aa23f119d11fb695427f81478fa996\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5ece21d99aa23f119d11fb695427f81478fa996/0_328_4646_2789/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photographer Alastair Hendy in his restored Georgian shop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photographer Alastair Hendy in his restored Georgian shop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Designer and food photographer Alastair Hendy also lives between London and Hastings. \u201cA lot of people are moving here,\u201d he says. He restored a Georgian shop on the high street, opening AG Hendy and Co in 2011, selling classic household products. Many look Victorian but are actually new, from old-fashioned ostrich feather dusters to a best-selling nail brush. \u201cWe don\u2019t sell anything plastic,\u201d says Hendy. \u201cWe want to make housework an enjoyable experience. It\u2019s practical, but when it\u2019s hanging up it doesn\u2019t have to be in a cupboard.\u201d Hendy has childhood memories of Hastings beach as his grandparents lived nearby. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of \u2018us and them\u2019 \u2013 locals and outsiders \u2013 but people are pretty warm.\u201d</p> <p>While this stretch of the south coast is said to be one of the sunniest places in the UK, I\u2019m told the windy winters can be gruelling. Luckily, the day I visit the town is a sun-soaked haven. I stop for lunch in West Hill cafe overlooking the sparkling bay, and watch a seagull steal another customer\u2019s chips. Later, sitting on the beach, I devour an artisan pistachio ice-cream and start to consider moving here myself.</p> <p>Following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/oct/05/hastings-pier-fire\">pier\u2019s devastating fire</a>, designer Stewart Walton, who runs the Hastings and Bexhill Wood Recycling Project, has been turning its salvaged wood into contemporary garden furniture. Residents have been snapping up the tables, chairs and keyrings made from the former landmark. \u201cThe wood has the spirit of all the musicians who played there,\u201d says Walton, who employs people from the nearby jobcentre to work on his projects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81c79fa0f11089d74c5518afbc4a165d5cd0940f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81c79fa0f11089d74c5518afbc4a165d5cd0940f/0_0_3619_4808/753.jpg\" alt=\"Printmaker Pea Crabtree in her studio.\" width=\"753\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Printmaker Pea Crabtree in her studio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another designer who has been involved in community projects is letterpress printmaker Pea Crabtree, originally from Lancashire, who runs her <a href=\"http://luckybudgie.com/\">Lucky Budgie</a> studio on the high street.

She plans to run workshops with young people there to commemorate the 950th anniversary of the battle of Hastings in October.</p> <p>Like everyone I meet, Crabtree has embraced Hastings, and extols the benefits of coastal life. \u201cThere is a spirit of fun here, like being on permanent holiday,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could ever live anywhere without the sea again.\u201d </p>",

After some pleasantries, I realise that the other interpreter is not a professional interpreter at all and has only a basic language certificate in BSL, probably enough to talk about what you are having for dinner and where you are going on holiday, but less able to describe the intricate workings of someone\u2019s uterus. I send the other interpreter home and offer to sort it out with the agency later.</p> <p>This is not uncommon. Most of our work is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/mar/02/interpreters-courts-protest-privatised-contract\">outsourced by the government </a>to large interpreting agencies, which have undercut each other and then outsourced the work to specialists. After the agencies take their share, there isn\u2019t much money left and we are often asked to take a pay cut \u2013 despite the government paying hand over fist for translation services. </p> <p>Many larger agencies lack understanding about what we do, with BSL too often simply added onto the list of languages available. Sometimes the agencies bypass professional interpreters completely and opt for untrained signers who come cheap. This is particularly apparent with legal and court interpreting. Five years ago, legal work was taken on by the best interpreters. Now, they are all agency staff and often inexperienced. The results are clear, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/may/04/thousands-of-court-cases-adjourned-due-to-failures-in-interpreting-services\">thousands of court cases being adjourned </a>due to failures in interpreting services. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/mar/02/interpreters-courts-protest-privatised-contract\">Interpreters stay away from courts in protest at privatised contract</a> </p> </aside>  <p> </p> <p>Back at my appointment, when my heavily pregnant client arrives we sit together in the waiting room. She and her husband were going to decide whether or not to find out the sex of their baby today, but her husband has been held up at work and she doesn\u2019t know what to do. We go in and I stand near the radiographer, who asks if my client wants to find out if it is a boy or girl. My client suggests the radiographer can tell me, and I write it down on a piece of paper so she can take it home and they can decide later. As we walk out, I ask my client whether she has a preference. She laughs and says she is ecstatic; she knows they are having a girl. Turns out, she is pretty good at lip-reading.</p> <p> BSL makes up a tiny percentage of all interpreting services, but our funding comes from the same pot.

  "<p>Women\u2019s rights campaigners will take to the streets of Peru on Saturday to protest against sexual violence, in a move described by the country\u2019s women\u2019s minister as \u201ca cry against impunity\u201d.</p> <p>Organisers estimate that more than 50,000 people could take part in the march in the capital, Lima. Thousands more are expected to participate in about 23 towns and cities across the country.</p> <p>The march follows protests in Mexico, Bolivia, Colombia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/03/brazil-argentina-unite-protest-sexual-violence-gender\">Argentina and Brazil</a> over the past year, under the slogan #NiUnaMenos (<em>Not One Less)</em>, which paraphrases the words of murdered Mexican activist and poet Susana Chavez Castillo: \u201cNi una mujer menos, ni una muerte m\u00e1s\u201d (Not one woman less, not one more death).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/03/women-vow-to-fight-on-in-peru-after-fujimori-absolved-over-forced-sterilisations\">Women vow to fight on in Peru after Alberto Fujimori absolved over forced sterilisations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Almost daily, headlines tell the story of an epidemic of femicide in Peru. </p> <p>Last month, the media focused on <a href=\"http://peru21.pe/actualidad/tres-casos-agresion-sexual-contra-mujeres-que-nos-dicen-mucho-sobre-justicia-peru-2252427\">three cases</a> highlighting the lenient sentences given to perpetrators, lending impetus to Saturday\u2019s march. </p> <p>\u201cThis march is a cry against impunity, it\u2019s a cry for equality and for the decent treatment of women,\u201d said Ana Mar\u00eda Romero, Peru\u2019s new minister for women. \u201cIt will be a milestone, it will mark a before and after. There\u2019s more citizen awareness about women\u2019s rights.\u201d</p> <p>The march is just the beginning, according to Romero, 68, who twice served as the minister for women under the government of Alejandro Toledo, whose term as Peruvian president ran from 2001 to 2006. On average, 10 women are murdered every month in Peru, said Romero, while ministry figures indicate a further 20 are victims of attempted femicide.</p> <p>\u201cIf you add to those 10 who lose their lives the 20 victims who are saved by the skin of their teeth, then we are practically talking about one [attack] per day,\u201d she said. \u201cOf those 10 who are killed around six are under the age of 20.\u201d</p> <p>Romero began her latest stint with a bang by criticising remarks made by Peru\u2019s most senior Catholic cleric, Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani, the Archbishop of Lima. Speaking on his weekly radio programme, Cipriani made remarks that appeared to tacitly blame women and girls for provoking sexual attacks by dressing provocatively, as if in a \u201cshop window\u201d. </p> <p>The incoming minister publicly repudiated his remarks, saying his statement \u201cremoves all responsibility from the attacker\u201d.</p> <p>The archbishop apologised for his comments, which the church in Peru claimed had been taken out of context. But Romero said there was no room for misinterpretation.</p> <p>Women\u2019s rights groups praised her comments, which suggested a change in attitude from her previous terms in office, when she appeared to be \u201cstrongly influenced by sectors of the church\u201d, said Sus\u00e1na Chavez, director of <a href=\"http://promsex.org/\">Promsex</a>. </p> <p>The incident has boosted public debate over gender violence and sexist attitudes. Top of the agenda is how to protect vulnerable women when the justice system fails to do so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f05453162532393fb398f963ddc962e43a07515\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f05453162532393fb398f963ddc962e43a07515/80_56_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ana Mar\u00eda Romero\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ana Mar\u00eda Romero, Peru\u2019s minister for women, says the march is a cry for equality.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy MIMP Peru</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>CCTV images of a woman called Cindy Arlette Contreras being dragged by the hair through a hotel reception by her naked ex-boyfriend Adriano Pozo were widely circulated on the internet. Pozo received a suspended sentence after a judge ruled that Contreras\u2019 injuries did not suggest any intent on his part to rape or murder her.</p> <p>In a second widely publicised case, photos of Lady Guill\u00e9n\u2019s bruised face dating back to 2012 were made public. However, the injuries she suffered at the hands of her ex-boyfriend, Ronny Garc\u00eda, were not enough to convince the judge that her life was in danger and Garc\u00eda was released after spending four years in prison.</p> <p>\u201cThese cases outraged people and ignited the movement,\u201d march organiser Sasa de la Cruz, said. \u201cBut they are just two examples which show women can\u2019t get justice.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this week, Peru\u2019s human rights ombudsman, Eduardo Vega, said the state treated female survivors of physical or sexual violence with \u201cabsolute neglect\u201d.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.defensoria.gob.pe/modules/Downloads/prensa/notas/2015/NP-268-15.pdf\">2015 study by Peru\u2019s ombudsman\u2019s office</a>, La Defensor\u00eda del Pueblo, in 81% of the studied cases no measures were taken to protect survivors of attempted femicide. As a result, 24% of those women who had sought help were murdered by the assailant they had reported to the authorities, the study concluded.</p> <p>Romero said the new government, which took office on 28 July, would train police to be more aware of the problem, ensure better provision of psychological support, open more women\u2019s shelters, and establish 245 emergency centres for women across the country.</p> <p>\u201cOur problem is not a lack of legislation, it is how we apply the law. Those in charge of justice need more sensitivity and a better understanding of the rights of the women,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Sexual violence is pervasive in Peru, taking many forms. Aside from the number of femicide cases, more than 23% of Peruvian women between 18 and 29 said they had been <a href=\"http://repositorio.pucp.edu.pe/index/bitstream/handle/123456789/15889/IOP_1212_01_R_1.pdf?sequence=1\">inappropriately touched on public transport</a>, according to a 2012 study by Lima\u2019s La Cat\u00f3lica University.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fundamental to eradicate the macho and homophobic culture in this country,\u201d Romero said. \u201cHeading towards the bicentenary of our independence we still objectify women or naturalise violent conduct against her.</p> <p> \u201cThat belongs in a primitive era and has no place in the 21st century.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It seems increasingly obvious to me that the only sensible way to look at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">US election</a> is through the prism of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/parks-and-recreation\">Parks And Recreation</a>. This American sitcom, which sadly came to the end of its six-year run last year, starred <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/amy-poehler\">Amy Poehler</a> as local government official Leslie Knope, and once you start seeing the parallels between the lovely fictional show and the horrible reality shitshow, it makes the latter feel more bearable. Obviously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a> is Leslie, the blond politico, ambitious to her bones, who, whatever you think of her politics, is undeniably devoted to public service. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> is an amalgam of Leslie\u2019s two worst male rivals: first, <a href=\"http://parksandrecreation.wikia.com/wiki/Bobby_Newport\">Bobby Newport</a>, the spoilt manboy as rich in money as he is poor in self-awareness; second, the proudly offensive Jeremy Jamm, with a fondness for saying things like, \u201cI love Chinese crap. Lucy Liu, Gangnam Style, sushi, etcetera etcetera.\u201d That could so easily be a Trump quote, given that he semi-apologised for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">referring to Mexicans as drug dealers and rapists</a> by tweeting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/05/donald-trump-taco-bowl-i-love-hispanics-picture\">a photo of himself eating a taco bowl</a>, that I honestly had to check he hadn\u2019t said it in a CNN interview.</p> <p>It also seems increasingly obvious to me that the Clinton campaign needs to start screening Parks And Recreation at their events to solve what&#xa0;the media calls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2016/jun/08/hillary-clinton-wardrobe-matters-but-not-fashion-perspective\">Clinton\u2019s \u201clikability problem\u201d</a>. This doesn\u2019t refer to whether the electorate likes Clinton\u2019s policies, but how they imagine her to be as a person. For the past three decades the answer to that has been, by and large, no, they don\u2019t like her, with people hating her in the 1990s for being (if I remember correctly) an overly moralistic feminist who spat in housewives\u2019 cookie dough, and people hating her now because they think she\u2019s not moral enough, and that she will say anything to get elected. Clinton has generally seemed not to care about her personal unpopularity, which only made me like her more. But now she is running for the presidency against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/08/jk-rowling-on-donald-trump-voldemort-was-nowhere-as-bad\">a tiny-handed Voldemort</a> and so she is gritting her teeth and dealing with the issue. Last week she was asked, for the 10 billionth time, about her \u201clikability issues\u201d. Clinton replied that people like her once she\u2019s allowed to get on with the job, which is true, given her popularity when she was secretary of state and New York senator. It was a more dignified statement than the one she gave at the Democratic national convention last month: \u201cThrough all my years of public service, the \u2018service\u2019 part has always come easier to me than the \u2018public\u2019 part,\u201d she said, as though she were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/14/fiction-charlesdickens\">Boo Radley</a>, who could help people only under the cover of night and then scurry into the shadows, so as not to offend anyone with her antisocial weirdness.</p> <p>Yes, male politicians have to pass the \u201cWould you have a beer with me?\u201d test. But given that Clinton has been a successful politician for 15 years, the issue of her likability is clearly about more than mere appeal. The real problem is that, while she needs to be ambitious to get as far as she has, ambitious women are seen, still, as inherently unlikable. She\u2019s supposed to pretend that she doesn\u2019t actually want to be commander in chief, in the way female celebrities are supposed to pretend they don\u2019t have to starve themselves to be thin. Such things are passively attained without any unfeminine effort. <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/06/hillary-clinton-tracy-flick-and-the-reclaiming-of-ambition/486389/\">As Megan Garber recently wrote</a>, the female presidents now seen in US TV shows (Selina Meyer in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/veep\">Veep</a>, <a href=\"http://scandal.wikia.com/wiki/Sally_Langston\">Sally Langston in Scandal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/sep/29/usnews.broadcasting\">Mackenzie Allen in Commander In Chief</a>) attain their powerful positions by fluke, not conscious ambition. In fact, when Veep\u2019s Selina Meyer had to campaign for the presidency in the last season, she became absurd and duly lost the election. Women who strive for political power are evil, summed up by the character of Tracy Flick in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/sep/24/4\">the 1999 film Election</a>, still cited as the embodiment of monstrous female ambition, even though Tracy never does much wrong besides tear down some banners in frustration.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2016/jul/23/theresa-may-margaret-thatcher-spot-the-difference-uk-politics-hadley-freeman\">Theresa May, Margaret Thatcher: spot the difference \u2013 and the sexism | Hadley Freeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The one glorious exception to this rule is Leslie Knope, a woman who fights like hell for political promotion, and is applauded for it. There is no contradiction between her political drive and her&#xa0;personal appeal. Through the plotlines involving Knope, Newport and Jamm, the show\u2019s point is that likability is nothing compared with capability. While sitcoms with cynical male characters are the cutting edge of current cool (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/louis-ck\">Louie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/21/bojack-horseman-season-three-netflix\">BoJack Horseman</a>), I\u2019m hoping that Parks And Rec will be the one that foresaw the zeitgeist. Because given the number of female politicians currently in high positions, its depiction of political women should not be an outlier, but the harbinger of a sea change.</p>",

  "<p>At 8.45am on a grey Saturday, having trudged through <a href=\"http://friendsofeatonpark.co.uk/\">Norwich\u2019s Eaton Park</a> to join a milling crowd of 500 people, it hits me that what I\u2019m about to do is unwise. I am the kind of sedentary home-worker whose heart pummels his ribcage when he thinks of running for the bus, a former Sunday morning footballer whose only reason to sprint around a park is after a five-year-old daughter who has mastered her bicycle\u2019s pedals but not its brakes; and here I am surrounded by fit people, the sort who seem happy standing in a cool breeze wearing skimpy garments made of Lycra and polyester mesh.</p> <p>After heading to the start line we\u2019re off, the crowd diverging within moments into a bounding vanguard with one eye on their fitness apps, and the rest of us experiencing that strange horizontal sinking as we move back towards our natural place in the hierarchy. In my experience, parks are better appreciated at a walking pace, but for now we must puff our way around a 5km course that I have compartmentalised into manageable stretches: from the skate park to the football pitches, to the model boat pond by the grand circular colonnaded pavilion, to the miniature railway and the rose garden, the playground, the cycle speedway, the pitch and putt. And repeat three and a half times.</p> <p>This is <a href=\"http://www.parkrun.org.uk/\">Parkrun</a>, one of many ways in which parks are now reasserting themselves as important civic spaces in a society where fewer people have jobs that keep them fit, or budgets that stretch to gym memberships. Every weekend tens of thousands of people all over Britain are doing this, or attending military-style boot camps, or working out at a growing number of outdoor gyms. Earlier this year the parish council at Stoke Gifford, near Bristol, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/13/stoke-gifford-parkrun-council-condemned-charge-paula-radcliffe\">controversially tried</a> to charge Parkrun for using Little Stoke Park, a sign of the financial pressures that parks are under \u2013 despite the fact that many have lately been regenerated by national lottery money after decades of decline.

On a sunny summer afternoon it looks impeccable, even though its position beside the river Ouse meant it lay beneath metres of water during last December\u2019s floods. The only blemish is the paths\u2019 coating of droppings from a resident flock of Canada geese \u2013 enough of a problem for the council to have erected signs requesting visitors not to feed them. Here on any given day you might find young children enjoying a forest school session, or adults engaged in tai chi, orienteering, volleyball or gardening, or a purposeful march along the paths in a Nordic walking group.</p> <p>Joanna Ezekiel, 46, has recently taken up Nordic walking, but when I meet her she is sitting on a bench, happy to be distracted from reading War And Peace on her Kindle. A novelist, poet and Open University tutor, she tells me she values parks as a place to reflect or find inspiration. In 1993, she and her father saw <a href=\"https://www.artangel.org.uk/project/house/\">Rachel Whiteread\u2019s House</a> (a concrete cast of a Victorian terraced house) at Wennington Green in London\u2019s East End, when Ezekiel was working nearby as a newly qualified teacher. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard of it, but was absolutely fascinated by its startling and haunting presence on an ordinary east London green,\u201d she says. It inspired the plot of her young adult novel, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23227476-the-inside-out-house\">The Inside-Out House</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of ice-cream vendors have come into conflict with their local parks. The big boys come in offering silly money</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now that Ezekiel lives in York, Rowntree Park has become somewhere she can always find a peaceful spot to think or read. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/12/libraries-universityofyork\">park\u2019s cafe</a> is run by the city\u2019s recently outsourced library service, though the bustling little space is, in the words of chief executive Fiona Williams, \u201cmore cafe than library\u201d. A knitting club meets there weekly, as do reading groups; there are Wordless Wednesdays, when people gather to read and work and anyone speaking louder than a whisper is asked to quieten down.</p> <p>Parks have long been a source of inspiration for artists and writers: all human life goes on within them, and they form the backdrop to experiences spanning the sublime, the exciting, the amusing and the tragic. Last month, for instance, a baby <a href=\"http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/news/update-woman-arrested-after-baby-girl-found-in-park-1-8030629\">was allegedly abandoned in a park in Blackpool</a>, and in east London <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/london/2016-07-25/sunbather-run-over-by-council-van-while-lying-in-a-park/\">a sunbather was run over</a> by a council van; there was a heated debate over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/22/is-it-ok-to-sunbathe-in-undies-stripping-off-heatwave-sparks-debate\">whether it was OK to lie in the park in your underwear</a>, and Doncaster residents <a href=\"http://www.doncasterfreepress.co.uk/news/doncaster-residents-in-call-to-reclaim-parks-after-spate-of-serious-incidents-1-8006436\">called for the reintroduction of park wardens</a> after a series of assaults.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ab0140aa5a5f100e91927ff896f5c14edfb8c2e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab0140aa5a5f100e91927ff896f5c14edfb8c2e6/4_487_5991_3595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cawston Brass Band play Eaton Park\u2019s grand pavilion in Norwich.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cawston Brass Band play Eaton Park\u2019s grand pavilion in Norwich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Roberts/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The old-fashioned parkie is rarely spotted these days, but the few remaining staff with decades of experience have good stories to tell. Chris Lines, who works for Liverpool city council, is no longer fazed by seeing dog-walkers joined by people with cats, ferrets or even deer on leads, but he was taken aback when a CCTV camera at Croxteth Hall Country Park showed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjnIVer6Loc\">what appeared to be a ghostly figure</a> emerging from the bushes, \u201cwalking across the lawns and up the steps of the hall\u201d. Some say it\u2019s the spirit of the 7th Earl of Sefton, the hall\u2019s former owner, who died in 1972; others that it\u2019s a trick of the light. Lines tells me a ranger once excelled himself by spotting an ice-cream van and, on being told to verify the operator\u2019s name and check his permit, replying that there was no need as it was written on the vehicle: Mr Whippy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/20-years-commitment-to-green-flag-award-for-chris-worman-mbe/2704/2/1/999/\">Chris Worman</a> works for Rugby\u2019s parks service, though his voluntary role as a judge for Keep Britain Tidy\u2019s Green Flag awards takes him around the country. One of his favourite memories, he says, came just a few weeks ago: \u201cIn Rugby, the day after the European referendum, we had a Polish picnic in the park as a way of saying that, whatever Brexit means, they are still a part of our community. They\u2019re going to do it next year, too.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Beech has worked in parks and cemeteries for 49 years. Today he helps maintain <a href=\"http://www.sbg.org.uk/\">Sheffield Botanical Gardens</a> but previously he worked at the city\u2019s Endcliffe Park, where his duties included preparing the hire boats for the boating lake. There was a notorious swan, he says, \u201cthat didn\u2019t have a mate and got very aggressive\u201d. One day he and the head park-keeper were attacked: \u201cIt cornered us into the boatshed. We kept looking out through the cracks, and it stood there aggressively flapping its wings. We were stuck for 15 minutes until it decided it had had enough.\u201d</p> <p>Back in York\u2019s Rowntree Park, I pass a dovecote and a fountain bearing a statue of the Roman god Mercury, before meeting Jane Blackwood, a lawyer who is pushing her baby son in his buggy. \u201cI really love the fact the park\u2019s got a river running through it,\u201d she tells me. In the last couple of years, <a href=\"http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/10516856.Ice_cream_boat_sets_sail_on_the_River_Ouse/\">the Two Hoots floating ice-cream parlour</a>, an old tugboat and ice-cream van skilfully blended, has become a distinctive sight chugging up the river to its mooring here. \u201cI\u2019ve had a few lovely sunny afternoons eating those ice-creams with my toddler on the riverbank,\u201d she says, \u201cwaving to the tourist boats while the baby snoozes in the pushchair. Nothing out of the ordinary, but pretty magical to me.\u201d</p> <p>The more conventional ice-cream van is a classic feature of any British park on a summer\u2019s day, but even this now faces challenges. I\u2019m told this by Maurice Murray, whose cheery attitude and charity fundraising have prompted the Ice Cream Alliance <a href=\"http://www.ice-cream.org/news/fleetwood-ice-cream-man-voted-best-britain\">to name him its 2016 Mobiler of the Year</a> (\u201cmobiler\u201d is the preferred term for someone selling ice-cream from a vehicle). Murray\u2019s blue-and-white van is a familiar sight around the parks and streets of Fleetwood, Lancashire, chiming out Teddy Bears\u2019 Picnic or, on days when Manchester City are playing, Blue Moon. He loves the job, but some ice-cream sellers who have pitches in parks are facing difficulties with the authorities, he explained. \u201cI run a closed Facebook group for ice-cream mobilers and a lot of them have come into conflict with their local parks. We have one who\u2019s been in his local park for 25 years and his local authority have decided to put [the pitch] out to tender. Then the big boys come in offering silly money \u2013 and when they start paying high rents, obviously they\u2019ve got to get the money back. That\u2019s when it goes from your local man who\u2019s done it for 25 years and kept the prices low for local people, to prices that are inflated to maximise the profit. These are some of the problems that parks nowadays are having.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7bb1b2ca0f03628f6614e55af46f1f4a5ac1bc0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bb1b2ca0f03628f6614e55af46f1f4a5ac1bc0a/56_543_5944_3567/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cricket in Norwich\u2019s Eaton Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Poulson (bowling) and son Arlo (far right, in white) mark their birthdays in Norwich\u2019s Eaton Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Roberts/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like Parkrun, this points towards the broader issue of how government cuts and councils\u2019 finances are affecting Britain\u2019s 27,000 public parks. The communities and local government select committee <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/communities-and-local-government-committee/news-parliament-2015/public-parks-launch-16-17/\">opened an inquiry</a> into the subject last month, with written submissions welcome until 30 September. One person sure to contribute is Dave Morris, with whom I take a wander around <a href=\"http://lordshiprec.org.uk/\">Lordship Recreation Ground</a> in north London. Here we see young men using the \u00a3100,000 outdoor gym (\u201cBecause local authorities now have responsibility for ill-health prevention strategies,\u201d Morris explains), and a class of blue-jumpered schoolchildren studying nature by the pond.</p> <p>Morris is part of the park\u2019s not-for-profit co-operative management team. He is also chair of the <a href=\"http://www.natfedparks.org.uk/\">National Federation of Parks and Green Spaces</a> and a battle-hardened campaigner who was one of the \u201cMcLibel Two\u201d. With Helen Steel, he took on McDonald\u2019s in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLibel_case\">a 20-year legal saga</a> that, even if the fast-food chain ultimately won, damaged its reputation.</p> <p>Over lunch at the straw-bale-built Hub building, which combines a cafe with rooms for yoga, dance and art classes, Morris argues that we\u2019re in the middle of \u201ca major crisis: there needs to be a massive public outcry in defence of the UK\u2019s urban green spaces\u201d. He cites a <a href=\"https://www.hlf.org.uk/state-uk-public-parks\">Heritage Lottery Fund report</a> from 2014, which produced a bleak set of figures. It revealed that 86% of parks managers had seen budget cuts since 2010, and expected them to continue until 2017; 81% of council parks departments had lost skilled management staff, and 77% had lost frontline staff; 45% of local authorities were looking at selling their parks and green spaces or outsourcing their management. A <a href=\"http://www.cfpuk.co.uk/stateofukpublicparks/\">follow-up report</a> next month is expected to show further cuts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even on a busy Saturday morning there's no traffic to be heard, only children whooping and birdsong</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Across London, Hammersmith and Fulham council thought it had found a solution. In 2013, the Conservative-run administration agreed to hand over around a third of Hammersmith Park to the private business Play Football, which would convert this publicly accessible land into paid-entry football pitches and run the centre under a 35-year lease. But after a Labour win in the May 2014 council election, and a noisy campaign of local opposition that went to judicial reviews funded by the writer Virginia Ironside, the centre <a href=\"https://www.lbhf.gov.uk/articles/news/2016/02/free-football-pitches-residents-open-white-city\">opened this year in a very different form</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outcome,\u201d Ironside tells me. \u201cA much smaller area has been made into football pitches. These are all owned by the council, which retained full ownership of the park with no leases involved. Play Football have a management contract for seven years, which is renewable or not, depending on how it goes.\u201d</p> <p>Our parks have long been political spaces, a managed approximation of the rural in the midst of our towns and cities, and as such prey to conflicting intentions. Even their founding motivation had its flip side: when Victoria Park <a href=\"http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgnl/leisure_and_culture/parks_and_open_spaces/victoria_park/victoria_park.aspx\">opened as London\u2019s first public park in 1845</a>, it was a patrician gesture aimed at improving the health of the downtrodden, dock-working cockney proletariat; but its advocates also included those who wished to deter them from heading west to the fashionable parks of central London, bringing their diseases with them. (Likewise, Liverpool\u2019s beautiful Victorian parks were created not just to give workers respite from the industrial smoke and cholera-infested slums, but because their employers knew a healthier workforce would be more productive.)</p> <p>The cultural historian <a href=\"https://traviselborough.co.uk/\">Travis Elborough</a> talks me through this as we walk around Victoria Park, often dubbed the \u201cgreen lungs of the East End\u201d, which in recent years <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/victoria-park-to-get-12m-regeneration-6456060.html\">has seen \u00a312m of investment</a>. He locates the seeds of this change in the 1970s, when \u201cthe first generation of middle-class gentrifiers were buying a version of working-class community\u201d. There are still remnants of traditional London here, such as the <a href=\"http://vphthac.org.uk/\">Victoria Park Harriers and Tower Hamlets Athletics Club</a>, or the old boys who take pride in racing their finely engineered miniature speedboats in the pond. But then there are two modern cafes (homemade sourdough bread and crab Benedict at one, Indian street food at the other) and a recently established croquet club <a href=\"http://croqueteast.co.uk/\">whose website</a> features Edwardian-garbed ironists inviting us to \u201ccross mallets and bash balls whilst sipping Pimm\u2019s, munching cucumber sandwiches and discussing the relative merits of Sartre and Descartes\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"35ae956b83c3b1d5ab83535c3c6204bab411b53b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35ae956b83c3b1d5ab83535c3c6204bab411b53b/39_17_5944_4462/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dean\u2019s Park in York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"751\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dean\u2019s Park in York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Roberts/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As one of London\u2019s most popular green spaces, Victoria Park looks untouchable. Many more parks around Britain face a battle to remain intact, well-maintained and free of charge. Selling off parkland, transferring the management to corporate interests, \u201cinappropriate development\u201d and commercialisation \u2013 these are all strategies Dave Morris tells me he has seen authorities deploy. Even at the widely admired Lordship Rec, he and his colleagues faced a proposal last year from the council to build houses on a third of the land (\u201cI\u2019m glad to say they\u2019ve now backed down\u201d). Elsewhere, Morris says he is seeing \u201cstaffing decimated across the country\u201d, and \u201can increasing amount of large concerts, often at peak summer periods, causing disruption and damage\u201d. He mentions Finsbury Park\u2019s <a href=\"http://wirelessfestival.co.uk/\">Wireless festival</a>, which closes off a large area of land, and the fact that Wandsworth council <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battersea_Park_Street_Circuit\">has allowed Formula E racing</a> at Battersea Park. (A council spokesman tells me that last month\u2019s event was the second and final one, and that \u00a3400,000 of the \u00a32.85m it made will be ringfenced for the park; the remainder will fund essential services such as libraries.)</p> <p>Similar tensions are playing out wherever you look. In Newcastle this spring there was uproar when the council considered \u2013 though later rejected \u2013 the adventure playground company Go Ape\u2019s proposal to convert <a href=\"http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/petition-stop-go-ape-opening-11137219\">a chunk of Heaton Park into a visitor attraction</a>. Stockport residents were dismayed last year when <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/council-bosses-approve-plans-new-8409764\">councillors agreed to allow 70 houses to be built</a> on two hectares of Reddish Vale Country Park. Unsurprisingly, it is the regions beyond London and south-east England that suffer most: according to the Heritage Lottery Fund report, Scotland, Wales and the north-west of England have the largest proportion of parks in decline.</p> <p>So how ought we to be covering the costs? <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/learning-rethink-parks\">The Rethinking Parks project</a>, run jointly in 2014-15 by the Big Lottery Fund, the Heritage Lottery Fund and the charity Nesta, looked at 11 experimental approaches, publishing its results in February. One success was the Bristol ParkWork scheme, which saw 17 unemployed people given temporary maintenance roles in the city\u2019s parks: this led to seven later gaining jobs, while saving the council \u00a327,000. Another was Burnley\u2019s Go to the Park, a \u201cpermaculture\u201d project in which mowed lawns made way for wildflower meadows, and traditional Victorian planting schemes were changed into lower-maintenance ones featuring more perennials. This approach has saved the council nearly \u00a370,000.</p> <p>Until such ideas are widely established, it\u2019s hard to see beyond a short-term future of grinding attrition between cash-strapped councils and the 5,000-plus \u201cfriends\u201d groups that campaign on their local park\u2019s behalf. And as Elborough, author of the recently published <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1098877/a-walk-in-the-park/\">A Walk In The Park</a>: The Life And Times Of A People\u2019s Institution, tells me, the tensions are older than you might imagine. Drinking a flat white by Victoria Park\u2019s duck pond, he explains that places such as <a href=\"http://www.vauxhallgardens.com/vauxhall_gardens_briefhistory_page.html\">Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens</a> were commercial entities, like theme parks: you had to pay admission. The country\u2019s first public park, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby_Arboretum\">Arboretum</a> in Derby, opened in 1840 and charged for entry five days a week; last year its current manager, Michael McNaught, reluctantly floated <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/wellbeing/outdoors/11908169/Britains-public-parks-175-years-old-but-will-they-survive.html\">the idea of reintroducing a fee</a> for visitors from outside the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f808281ae240ee8134768f9e68c861e043bb5ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f808281ae240ee8134768f9e68c861e043bb5ce/22_73_5938_3928/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Japanese garden in Hammersmith Park, London.

In the background, redevelopment continues at the former BBC Television Centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Roberts/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Victoria Park was designed by James Pennethorne, one of the \u201cgreat tidy-uppers of London\u201d, Elborough points out. \u201cThe idea was that part of its construction would be paid for by the sale and development of luxury mansions or parkside villas. In the end that didn\u2019t really work, because the canal was a working canal and it\u2019s still the East End. But that, essentially, was one of the motors for its development \u2013 that you\u2019d have these nice luxury homes and they would make the money.\u201d The Victorian model has in many ways returned: a few miles north of here, <a href=\"http://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/new-homes/london/finsbury-park/woodberry-down\">the Woodberry Down development</a> boasts \u201cluxury apartments\u201d with a view over \u201cacres of beautifully landscaped parkland\u201d.</p> <p>Back in Eaton Park in Norwich, my heart is thudding as I lie collapsed on the grass, gazing at the clouds, moments after achieving my modest target of completing the course without stopping. My time is 26 minutes 15 seconds, which puts me in 246th place, the winner having finished nine minutes earlier. I am almost exactly average, but it feels good to have proved a touch fitter than I feared, to have felt a brief camaraderie with strangers as we coaxed each other over the line, and simply to have the opportunity of running around an elegant green space so large that even on a busy Saturday morning there\u2019s no city traffic to be heard, only children whooping from the playground, birdsong and runners panting. If our parks are a city\u2019s lungs, they are also a good part of its soul: we sell them at a higher price than any council\u2019s accountants could begin to imagine.</p>",
  "<h2>My brother, a Tefl teacher, wants to return to the UK \u2013 what are his job options?</h2> <p><strong>My brother has been a Tefl teacher for more than a decade and is head of a Tefl school for adults in Australia.

It is all rather dependent on employment, of course, which is probably the first factor before location.</strong></p> <p><strong>My brother is a dedicated and passionate teacher. I feel teachers across the spectrum in this country are not valued (I say this as a teacher myself), so I\u2019d be really interested in your view and those of Tefl teachers here. Also, are there any areas in the UK with a particular need for Tefl teachers?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>This is such a specialised inquiry that I can do little better than refer your brother to a good search engine. I\u2019ve surfed a bit myself and it\u2019s clear there is demand for experienced Tefl teachers in the UK, though I suspect opportunities for someone as senior as your brother may be few and far between.</p> <p>As far as location is concerned, it seems obvious that demand is most likely to be concentrated in the larger metropolitan areas such as London, Birmingham, Manchester and so on.</p> <p>But, as is so often the case, your brother\u2019s questions are most likely to be usefully answered by that small army of Guardian readers always so ready to share their first-hand knowledge.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 Oxford, Cambridge and Bath have a year-round Tefl offer. Don\u2019t discount holiday revision courses too \u2013 Oxford is full of them and students are increasingly diverse, needing EFL and subject-specific tuition. <strong>Green123 </strong></p> <p>\u2022 I was in a similar situation when I moved back from Mexico. Initially the options were limited, but when a friend suggested looking at English as an additional language (EAL) posts in boarding schools, a whole world opened up. Many boarding schools rely on an intake of overseas pupils and a strong EAL department is essential to making a success of this strategy. <strong>juliafbird</strong></p> <p>\u2022 One option is to work at a summer school for kids. You can find these jobs at <a href=\"http://www.tefl.com/\">Tefl.com</a>. Another better-paid option is to get a job teaching EAP (English for academic purposes) at a university. The best way into this is to apply to teach on a pre-sessional summer course. These jobs are on <a href=\"http://www.jobs.ac.uk/\">Jobs.ac.uk</a>. It\u2019s not uncommon to be taken on for teaching work in the academic year following the summer course. You stand more of a chance if you have the Delta qualification, or an MA in Tesol and applied linguistics. <strong>Katy Yelland</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Lots of universities have partnerships with an organisation called <a href=\"http://www.intostudy.com/en-gb/about-into\">Into</a>, which helps international students brush up on their language skills before they start university. <strong>Scrowjane</strong></p> <p>\u2022 It\u2019s pointless teaching English as a foreign language in Britain. The job pays better and has more status in eastern Europe or Asia or Latin America. The real money is to be made in oil-producing countries. <strong>KarlNaylor75</strong></p> <p>\u2022 I\u2019ve worked as and recruited teachers into EAP in a university. The jobs are advertised on university websites, <a href=\"http://www.jobs.ac.uk/\">Jobs.ac.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://baleap.org/\">Baleap.org</a>.

I imagine you have photographic records of at least some of your constructions or, if not, could soon produce them.</p> <p>The point I\u2019m making is that in the absence of formal employment experience, hard physical evidence of your competence could be an excellent substitute. The more ingenious and imaginative you can make such an exhibit, the more effective it can be. Its very construction proves your abilities.</p> <p>Then you should see if you can attract a little publicity. You could start a blog about your passion, passing on hints to others. And maybe attract a mention in your local paper with a photograph of one of your constructions. It doesn\u2019t have to be a great feature: just enough for you to add to your credentials.</p> <p>If you can achieve some or all of this, plus any other thoughts that may occur to you, you start from a stronger position when you approach model-making or film prop companies. You will not be an inexperienced amateur but an interesting individual with evident talent, and even something of an established reputation.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 Have you thought about doing videos of your model making and putting them on YouTube?

Something will sell for a big margin. Make more to check it wasn\u2019t a one-off. Next, set up as a sole trader and get a website going. Be unique, sell for good margins and take pride in quality and customer service. If and when you get bored of working alone you\u2019ll have more than enough skills to get a job you want. <strong>8rocko</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Think broader: architects need models, training companies need training rigs and demo sets, hospitality companies need one-off giveaways, colleges need displays \u2026 <strong>Justabloke</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Your skills may be well used in the engineering sector \u2013 I am told it\u2019s easier to get into than creative industries.

The unique wildlife is already stressed by a warming climate and the loss of sea ice, and the arrival of mega-cruise ships in this part of the world could push it further towards the edge,\u201d said Rod Downie, WWF-UK Polar programme manager.</p> <p>\u201cWe recognise the positive steps that Crystal Cruises have taken to minimise their impact, working with local communities and in particular choosing not to burn heavy fuel oil in the Arctic, which is more persistent and damaging to wildlife if spilled. But if tourism is not sustainable, we risk ruining the very thing that tourists would come to see.\u201d</p> <p>The Crystal Serenity will set sail from Seward, Alaska, for New York on a 32-day, near 1,000-mile journey through the famous Northwest Passage waterway via Canada and Greenland. </p> <p>Arguments around the Arctic have more recently centred on oil company drilling such as Shell\u2019s controversial and now abandoned attempts to explore off the coast of Alaska and new plans to open up the Norwegian far north.</p> <p>But the increasing scope for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Polar-Opposites-Opportunities-threats-Guardian-ebook/dp/B0076KWQ7M\">industrialising the region</a> as the ice melts has also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/jun/16/drilling-oil-gas-arctic-alaska\">triggered geopolitical tensions and talk of a new cold war because the legal status of who owns what up there is uncertain</a>.</p> <p>Michael Byers, a professor of politics and law at the University of British Columbia, says the Crystal Serenity <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/why-trudeau-should-move-now-to-safeguard-the-northwest-passage/article31382232/\">should be used to spur new talks between the Canadian and US governments about disputed waterway rights in the Arctic</a>.</p> <p>On its website, Crystal Cruises describes the cruises as a  \u201cworld away from the sunny Mediterranean and the Caribbean\u2019s white sandy beaches, cruises around the polar regions offer an entirely different adventure.</p> <p>\u201cSince these are luxury cruises, you could spend your days at sea in a hot whirlpool out on deck, glass of wine in hand \u2013 or head ashore on an expedition, learning more about these remote ecosystems with the help of expert guides,\u201d said the Los Angeles-based company.</p> <p>In a statement, Crystal Cruises said it was taking great care with the sailing. It had been \u201cworking on this project since 2013 and will be implementing a number of additional precautions to ensure the safety of all guests and crew, as well as to protect the pristine environment. </p> <p>\u201cWe have taken many extraordinary operational and equipment-related measures to ensure a safe voyage. The typical conditions along the planned route during the Arctic summer are substantially free of ice and within Crystal Serenity\u2019s safe-operating parameters.</p> <p>\u201cOf note is our intention to use ultra low-sulphur content marine gas oil, which far exceeds the current requirements in that region. This, along with a relatively slow transit speed, will achieve our goal of minimising our carbon footprint.\u201d</p> <p>The Crystal Serenity will carry 1,000 passengers \u2013 some reputed to be paying up to $120,000 (\u00a392,000) \u2013 plus 650 crew members. There is a casino, six restaurants and a cinema on board. The vessel is by far the largest luxury cruise ship to sail through these remote, icy waters.</p> <p>Crystal Serenity will be accompanied by an ice\u2013strengthened polar logistics vessel, RRS Ernest Shackleton, for safety backup. The vessel is normally used by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), a publicly-funded organisation. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36541583\">Concerns have been raised</a> about this but a spokesman for the BAS said it had no authority over how the vessel was employed in the summer months and made no financial gain from the Crystal Serenity work.</p>",

Tonight the teams are competing against each other rather than simply riding their own race one at a time. That brings an advantage for the faster team in the pairing, because they can benefit from what British Cycling (BC) refer to as \u201ccirculating air mass\u201d. In other words, slipstream. The faster team can get into their rivals\u2019 slipstream, even if they are still some way from lapping them. The boffins at BC reckon the advantage can be worth 20-30watts. That\u2019s what they call a marginal gain.</p> <p>2. Someone might have shut the velodrome doors. It certainly feels hotter in here tonight. Dame Sarah Storey reportedly reckons she narrowly failed at breaking the women\u2019s hour record because someone opened the doors in the velodrome in London. </p> <p>3.

I personally think there\u2019s far two many opportunities to win multiple medals as apart from breaststroke you don\u2019t need to be a specialist, whereas in pretty much all the other sports you do. I\u2019ve always thought a good idea would be to have a \u2018championship\u2019 for each stroke- each swimmer does each distance in a particular stroke, they get a certain number of points depending on where they finish in each one, and you then get one overall winner for the four disciplines. It\u2019d certainly make the watching less interminable as you\u2019d have a running score each day and you could still have relays to keep up the nationalism.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ad9ea2e4b024cdec3d6d6f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T10:02:29.459Z\">11.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?id=become_supporter\" data-alt=\"Support the Guardian\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?id=become_supporter\">Support the Guardian</a> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ad9c0ee4b0fe7550975124\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T09:51:52.960Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>I think somebody may mean business \u2026</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/caster800m/status/764028255867441152\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/oHyeoCUCzH\">pic.twitter.com/oHyeoCUCzH</a></p>&mdash; Caster Semenya (@caster800m) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/caster800m/status/764028255867441152\">August 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T09:53:10.349Z\">at 10.53am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ad9b52e4b0fe755097511d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T09:49:10.887Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Now then, I mentioned a little earlier that we\u2019ve got the culmination of the team dressage competition</strong> with the grand prix special, having had the grand prix yesterday.

  "<p>Australia must close its \u201cdire and untenable\u201d offshore immigration detention centres, the United Nations has again told the country, following the release of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/nauru-files\">Nauru files</a> by the Guardian, which has exposed widespread and systemic abuse on the island.</p> <p>Guardian Australia this week published more than 2,000 leaked incident reports \u2013 running to more than 8,000 pages \u2013 which revealed a regime of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">routine dysfunction and cruelty</a>, showing widespread sexual and physical abuse of men, women and children, massive rates of self-harm and suicide attempts among those detained, and harsh living conditions in indefinite detention.<br></p> <p>Speaking overnight in Geneva, a <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20368&amp;LangID=E\">spokeswoman for the UN high commissioner for human rights, Ravina Shamdasani, said</a>: \u201cWe are extremely concerned about the serious allegations of violence, sexual assault, degrading treatment and self-harm contained in more than 1,000 incident reports from offshore processing centres on Nauru, many of which reportedly involved children.</p> <p>\u201cWe have conducted regular visits to Nauru in recent years and many of the allegations contained in the documents are, sadly, consistent with the findings from these visits. We have regularly and persistently brought these to the attention of the governments of Nauru and of Australia.\u201d <br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1516/Quick_Guides/Offshore\">Of the asylum seekers </a>who have had their claims assessed on Nauru, 77% have been found to be refugees, that is, they have fled a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution\u201d and are legally owed protection. The majority on Nauru have been held for more than three years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/13/they-dont-care-a-refugees-story-of-reporting-sexual-assault-on-nauru\">\u2018They don\u2019t care\u2019: a refugee\u2019s story of reporting sexual assault on Nauru</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shamdasani said asylum seekers and refugees held in Australian-run offshore detention were growing sicker and more distressed the longer they were held.</p> <p>This is supported by the Australian government\u2019s own internal documents, which show that the mental health of people in detention, but most acutely children, deteriorates dramatically the longer they are held without prospect of release. </p> <p>\u201cTeams from our office have witnessed many of the migrants, asylum seekers and refugees, including children, in Nauru suffering from severe mental health problems as a result of their detention and lack of certainty,\u201d Shamdasani said.</p> <p>\u201cTheir situation has become increasingly dire and untenable, exacerbated by the indefinite nature of their time in Nauru, or for that matter in Manus Island in Papua New Guinea.\u201d </p> <p>Several arms of the UN have repeatedly condemned Australia\u2019s offshore regime, including the <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16012&amp;LangID=E\">UN high commissioner for human rights</a>, the <a href=\"http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CAT/Shared%20Documents/AUS/CAT_C_AUS_CO_4-5_18888_E.pdf\">UN committee against torture</a>, the <a href=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1425873116713/Mendez-report.pdf\">UN special rapporteur on torture</a>, the <a href=\"http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16503&amp;LangID=E\">UN special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/26/un-refugee-agency-condemns-australias-offshore-detention-regime\">UN high commissioner for refugees</a>.</p> <p>Shamdasani repeated the UN\u2019s position that Australia must end offshore processing.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe have consistently called on the authorities in Nauru and Australia to put an end to the model of processing and keeping migrants offshore,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/13/one-day-in-september-a-grim-24-hours-in-naurus-detention-centre\">One day in September: a grim 24 hours in Nauru\u2019s detention centre</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe call on Australia and Nauru to expeditiously end the immigration detention of children, and urge the authorities to institute human rights-compliant alternatives.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the former prime minister Tony Abbott, who was elected to office on a policy platform of \u201cstopping the boats\u201d \u2013 the arrival by sea of asylum seekers to Australia \u2013 has said he laments blocking the previous Labor government\u2019s \u201cMalaysia Solution\u201d, which would have led to 800 boat arrivals to Australia being sent to Malaysia in exchange for 4000 UNHCR-registered refugees in that country to be brought to Australia.</p> <p>The rationale for the policy was to deter people from taking dangerous boat journeys to Australia, but the policy was vociferously opposed by the Abbott-led opposition and <a href=\"http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2011/hca32-2011-08-31.pdf\">ultimately defeated in the high court </a>because Malaysia is not a state party to the UN refugees convention.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://tonyabbott.com.au/2016/08/transcript-of-the-hon-tony-abbott-mp-address-to-the-samuel-griffith-society-stamford-plaza-hotel-adelaide/\">speech to the Samuel Griffith Society</a> on Friday night, Abbott said he wondered about the wisdom of opposing, and ultimately defeating, the policy, even if he did not support it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/11/comparing-nauru-to-guantanamo-bay-is-ridiculous-says-australian-immigration-minister\">Comparing Nauru to Guant\u00e1namo Bay is ridiculous, says Australian immigration minister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe 800 boat people that could have been sent to Malaysia was less than a month\u2019s intake, even then. I doubt it would have worked.</p> <p>\u201cStill, letting it stand would have been an acknowledgment of the government-of-the-day\u2019s mandate to do the best it could, by its own lights, to meet our nation\u2019s challenges. It would have been a step back from the hyper-partisanship that now poisons our public life.\u201d<br></p> <p>The executive director of the Human Rights Law Centre, Hugh de Kretser, said the Australian government had established a system that \u201cinflicts tremendous harm on innocent people, including children\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNo policy challenges justify inflicting this harm on innocent people. We are responsible for the harm. We can\u2019t turn a blind eye. We have to end this now by brining these people here to safety.\u201d</p>"
