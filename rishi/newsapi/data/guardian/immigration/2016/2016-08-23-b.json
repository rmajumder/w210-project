  "<p>Cosmetics companies must be banned from using plastic microbeads in scrubs, toothpaste and beauty products because of the marine pollution they are causing, say a group of MPs.</p> <p>Members of the environmental audit committee have called for a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/14/nment-backs-microbeads-ban-george-eustice\">ban</a> within 18 months after hearing that trillions of tiny pieces of plastic are accumulating in the world\u2019s oceans, lakes and estuaries, harming marine life and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/20/microfibers-plastic-pollution-oceans-patagonia-synthetic-clothes-microbeads\">entering the food chain</a>. About 86 tonnes of microplastics are released into the environment every year in the UK from facial exfoliants alone, they were told. </p> <p>Microplastic pollution comes from the fragmentation of larger pieces of plastic waste, small synthetic fibres from clothing and the microbeads used in cosmetics and other products. The microbeads in scrubs, shower gels and toothpastes are an avoidable part of this plastic pollution problem. A single shower could result in 100,000 plastic particles entering the ocean, said the committee chair, Mary Creagh.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a full, legal ban, preferably at an international level as pollution does not respect borders,\u201d she added. \u201cIf this isn\u2019t possible after our vote to leave the EU, then the government should introduce a national ban. The best way to reduce this pollution is to prevent plastic being flushed into the sea in the first place.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8791a932b573c0bc5609730e06383f56423c76aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8791a932b573c0bc5609730e06383f56423c76aa/0_0_5344_3207/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Closeup of plastic microbeads on the tip of a finger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plastic microbeads.

But the committee said a national ban, preferably starting within 18 months, would have advantages for consumers and the industry in terms of consistency, universality and confidence. It is a significant and avoidable environmental problem. Addressing it would show commitment to reducing the wider problem of microplastics.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/08/mps-attack-loopholes-in-cosmetic-industrys-microbead-phase-out\">Microbeads</a> are part of the wider issue of microplastics.

Opportunities to capture microplastics through enhanced washing-machine filtration systems and improved waste and water sewage treatment processes must also be explored.</p> <p>The committee called for urgent research, saying: \u201cIf someone eats six oysters, it is likely they will have eaten 50 particles of microplastics. Relatively little research has been done on potential impacts to human health or the marine ecology.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the world\u2019s ocean plastics by weight are large pieces of debris (eg fishing equipment, bottles and plastic bags). However, the dominant type of debris by quantity is microplastics. It is estimated that 15-51tn microplastic particles have accumulated in the ocean, with microplastics reported at the sea surface and on shorelines worldwide. They are also present in remote locations including deep sea sediments and arctic sea ice.</p> <p>Richard Thompson, director of the international marine litter research unit at Plymouth University, said: \u201cMicrobeads in cosmetics are an avoidable source of microplastic to the environment and so legislation would be a welcome step.\u201d </p> <p>Tamara Galloway, at the University of Exeter, agreed. \u201cPollution from microbeads is a truly global problem,\u201d she said. \u201cTides and currents can carry pollution across oceans to countries a long distance from where they were originally released. Ideally, any legislation to control them should be on an international level.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>The number of lawsuits accusing Starbucks of deceiving its customers by serving them too much ice has fallen by one. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/02/starbucks-sued-too-much-ice-drinks\">Woman sues Starbucks over ice-to-coffee ratio in cold drinks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In June, a California man named Alexander Forouzesh filed a proposed class action suit alleging that customers ordering cold beverages from Starbucks received less liquid than advertised as ice could take up as much space as 10 fl oz. </p> <p>But ordering a cold drink means it will be served with ice, according to US district judge Percy Anderson. In his decision, Percy <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/08/23/incredulous-judge-tosses-lawsuit-accusing-starbucks-of-putting-too-much-ice-in-cold-drinks/\">wrote</a>:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If children have figured out that including ice in a cold beverage decreases the amount of liquid they will receive, the Court has no difficulty concluding that a reasonable consumer would not be deceived into thinking that when they order an iced tea, that the drink they receive will include both ice and tea and that for a given size cup, some portion of the drink will be ice rather than whatever liquid beverage the consumer ordered.</p> </blockquote> <p>The judge also pointed out that since the cups used for cold drinks are clear, it is easy for customers to see how much ice they are getting. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Starbucks/status/586204461040738305\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">You can order light ice or extra ice on any of our iced beverages. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ProTip?src=hash\">#ProTip</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JustRight?src=hash\">#JustRight</a></p>&mdash; Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Starbucks/status/586204461040738305\">April 9, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Since the lawsuit was first filed, Starbucks has insisted that ice is an \u201cessential component of any \u2018ice\u2019 beverage\u201d.

Chicago resident Stacey Pincus filed a 29-page complaint claiming that Starbucks\u2019 cup sizes were deceiving customers since ice beverages contained less liquid than advertised. The complaint also noted that cold drinks tended to cost more than hot drinks and that the company was making more money off of customers buying iced drinks. </p> <p>\u201cI can promise you the ice issue is much ado about nothing,\u201d Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, <a href=\"http://www.aol.com/article/2016/06/01/starbucks-ceo-clears-the-air-over-ice-lawsuit/21387690/\">told CNBC in June</a>. </p> <p>However, a few weeks later, a San Francisco judge allowed another lawsuit against Starbucks to go forward.

  "<p>Less than 24 hours after Gawker.com was killed by billionaire Peter Thiel\u2019s legal crusade against it, another billionaire couple \u2013 Donald and Melania Trump \u2013 is already using the same law firm Thiel did to threaten more media organizations into silence. And this time, it could have a direct effect on the presidential election. </p> <p>The Guardian reported late on Monday night that Melania Trump\u2019s lawyers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/melania-trump-lawsuit-daily-mail\">have sent threatening letters</a> and are considering filing lawsuits against a variety of media organizations \u2013 including the Daily Mail, Politico and the Week \u2013 for reporting on rumors of Melania Trump\u2019s past, including her alleged immigration status when she came to the United States.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/19/bullies-gawker-powerful-14-years\">We were sometimes bullies at Gawker \u2013 but we held the powerful to account | Joshua David Stein</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is the quintessential example of the disturbing precedent Peter Thiel has just set by creating a blueprint for billionaires to destroy news organizations they do not like. He has shown that all they need is a little persistence. And in a media landscape that is increasingly dominated by the rich and powerful, that should give even Gawker\u2019s most ardent critics pause.</p> <p>We know Donald Trump and others have gone down this path before. Trump has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/trump-lies/\">openly bragged about</a> the fact that he sued a former New York Times reporter in the early aughts for the purpose of trying to hit the reporter involved financially. Trump did lose that lawsuit, but not until after litigation that undoubtedly cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees for the winning party. </p> <p>And if you think the Trumps are litigious now, just wait until after November. Peter Scheer, director of the First Amendment coalition, <a href=\"https://psmag.com/with-the-gawker-sale-whats-next-for-the-first-amendment-9a8feb0da215#.bh4zctt1v\">explained the consequences</a> of the Gawker case succinctly: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Say five years from now, if Trump loses and people are writing critical postmortems, will they have to worry that Trump will turn around and sue them? Because of the Gawker trial, I fear that many journalists will wonder, \u201cCould that happen to me, even in writing about Trump?\u201d They will be censoring themselves. That is the worst outcome here, and it\u2019s quite likely.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Trump is not the only culprit. In yet another ominous example, Mother Jones, the liberal nonprofit magazine known for its investigative journalism, spent millions of dollars in legal fees when another billionaire, Frank VanderSloot, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/media/2015/10/mother-jones-vandersloot-melaleuca-lawsuit\">sued the company and its reporters</a> over a critical story and some tweets from its editors. Mother Jones won the case last year, relatively early in the process, but still faced an existential financial crisis because of the enormous legal costs associated with the lawsuit. VanderSloot then announced a million-dollar fund to be used for suing Mother Jones and additional members of the \u201cliberal press\u201d in other cases.</p> <p>Even in the Hulk Hogan case, though many people rightly found the story and sex tape offensive and argued it shouldn\u2019t have been published to begin with, a federal judge and an appeals court panel <a href=\"http://gawker.com/how-things-work-1785604699\">both ruled</a> Gawker was protected by the first amendment before the trial, and they were prevented from having an appeals court rule on the judgment before they filed for bankruptcy. </p> <p>But we shouldn\u2019t forget that Gawker was not just getting sued over the Hulk Hogan sex tape case. They were the recipient of a half-dozen other lawsuits or legal threats involving many stories of an investigative or critical nature that virtually any first-year law student could tell you are clearly protected by the first amendment. </p> <p>In the end, even if you think Gawker deserved punishment, media organizations should not face the financial death penalty for a mistake, even a deplorable and egregious one. After all, there is probably one billionaire or another who hates pretty much every news organization in the world worth their salt. If they all decide to go down the path Thiel took, how many publications will be left when they\u2019re done? </p>",

And grocers enjoyed a 0.3% rise in sales in the 12 weeks to 14 August, the best performance since March.</p> <p>Nicholas Wrigley, Persimmon\u2019s chairman, said that while the result of the EU referendum had created increased uncertainty, the news was quickly digested by customers. <br></p> <p>\u201cCustomer interest since then has been robust with a strengthening of visitor numbers to our sites compared to the same period last year,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>Economists have revised their pessimistic forecasts for the rest of the year and 2017 following a run of figures showing only a modest dip and steady rise in activity since the June 23 vote.</p> <p>Pro-Brexit campaigners have taken these figures as a sign that the warnings of an economic collapse after a no vote were alarmist and misleading.</p> <p>However, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at financial data provider IHS Markit, said the bounceback was mostly the result of a \u201chuge policy response\u201d from the Bank of England and the Treasury.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say that everyone who was ringing the alarm bells over Brexit was scare mongering because really it was the warnings that triggered those strong policy actions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Bank of England governor Mark Carney said in June policymakers would consider radical action to avert a recession and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">in August pushed through a cut in interest rates</a> and a \u00a340bn boost to quantitative easing (QE).</p> <p>The chancellor, Philip Hammond, who rebuffed calls for an emergency budget, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/philip-hammond-there-will-be-no-brexit-budget\">has also hinted strongly that the government\u2019s previous plans for budget cuts could be relaxed</a>. </p> <p>Williamson said that without steep falls in the purchasing manager indices (PMIs) of activity in manufacturing, construction and services for July, collated by IHS Markit, it is possible the economy would have sleepwalked into a recession.</p> <p>\u201cIf the PMIs hadn\u2019t fallen off a cliff, the BoE wouldn\u2019t have cut interest rates and expanded QE,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The survey by the business lobby group the CBI of manufacturers found that the dive in sterling, prompted by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">the vote to leave the EU</a>, gave a strong boost to exports of manufactured goods that offset uncertainty in the domestic market.</p> <p>Total order books were slightly weaker in the three months to August compared with the quarter to the end of July, down from a balance of -4 to -5, the report said.</p> <p>But the overall picture was of an industry with orders that remained \u201ccomfortably above the long-run average\u201d, according to the CBI, with output growth at a healthy pace.</p> <p>The main shadow on the horizon was a concern that rising import costs would squeeze profitability. The average prices that manufacturers expected to charge over the next three months rose to +8 in August from +5 in July, their highest since February 2015.<br></p> <p>Paul Hollingsworth, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said the relatively upbeat tone of August\u2019s survey gave another reason to be tentatively optimistic about the referendum\u2019s impact on business.</p> <p>\u201cThe latest survey is another reason to think that the economy should avoid a deep recession,\u201d he said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/23/summer-weather-lifts-uk-supermarket-sales-ice-cream-burgers\">British supermarket sales were boosted in August</a> by the belated arrival of warm summer weather and a gold tinged Olympics feelgood factor, giving the best performance since March, according to Kantar Worldpanel. </p> <p>The market analysis firm said sales of ice-cream and lollies jumped by nearly a quarter in the last month of that period, while chilled drinks rose by 10% as Brits sought to cool off.</p> <p>The performance marks a bounceback from supermarkets\u2019 <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/jul/26/uk-supermarket-sales-fall-poor-july-weather\">worst performance in two years in July when cold, damp weather hit sales</a> in the wake of the Brexit vote.<br></p> <p>Discounters Aldi and Lidl continued to outperform the rest of the market with sales up 10.4% and 12.2% respectively. All the big four major supermarkets saw sales fall back, with Asda the worst of the bunch as sales fell 5.5%. Tesco achieved its best performance in 18 months but sales still fell by 0.4% taking its market share to 28.1%.</p> <p>The building industry suffered a share price slump ahead of the Brexit vote and in the week following. But Persimmon said trading since 23 June had been strong and that after a short period of wariness, customer interest had increased from a year earlier.</p> <p>However, after Persimmon\u2019s upbeat first half results and outlook its shares closed up 4.2% and other house builders were also among the biggest FTSE 100 risers, with Barratt rising 4.9%, Taylor Wimpey 4% and Berkeley Group 3.9%.</p> <p>Along with other housebuilders, Persimmon\u2019s shares fell after the referendum result amid fears that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jun/24/house-price-fall-could-follow-brexit-say-experts\">falling consumer confidence and an economic slowdown would dent the housing market</a>. Countrywide, Britain\u2019s biggest estate agent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/22/house-prices-to-fall-1-in-2017-predicts-countrywide\">predicted this week that average prices would fall 1% next year before rising again</a>.</p>",

Jones grew up in Chicago during the Depression. His father was a carpenter in the employ of the Jones Boys, \u201cnotorious OGs\u201d, as Quincy calls them. In other words, his old man was a chippy by appointment to the mob. \u201cAll I saw were dead bodies, tommy guns and stogies, and piles of money in back rooms.

When he brushed the keys, it was as if he\u2019d been plugged into a Van der Graaf generator. \u201cI touched that piano and every cell in my body said, this is what you do for the rest of your life: music.\u201d<br></p> <p>And he\u2019s done it in style.

Jones is probably best known for producing the platinum-selling Off the Wall and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/17/michael-jackson-thriller-first-album-sell-30m-copies-us\">Thriller</a>, arguably Michael Jackson\u2019s best albums.

And when the waiter brought \u2018<em>l\u2019addition</em>\u2019, he gave him the plate. And there were Picasso\u2019s plates all around the wall.

It was essential that Scotland\u2019s economic interests were protected, she added, after publishing a Scottish government paper which forecasts that Brexit could cost Scotland\u2019s economy as much as \u00a311.2bn by 2030, and cut public revenues by \u00a33.7bn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/17/nicola-sturgeon-brexit-referendum-eu-nationals-not-bargaining-chips\">Nicola Sturgeon tells EU nationals: 'You are not bargaining chips'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Based on forecasts \u2013 including a Treasury paper on the costs of Brexit which Sturgeon had previously attacked as \u201coverblown\u201d \u2013 the Scottish government document said even the least bad option of remaining within the single market as part of the European Economic Area would cut Scottish GDP by at least \u00a31.7bn by 2030.</p> <p>The document assumes that the EU economy will be stable between now and 2030, and forecasts that Brexit will damage the UK economy; but some recent figures suggest that the leave vote has not resulted in the economic harm the remain camp had predicted.</p> <p>Sturgeon said: \u201cThe publication today shows very clearly that if we\u2019re removed from the EU that challenge gets harder and the situation gets worse. So Scotland faces a choice: do we allow that situation to become harder by getting out of the European Union or do we seek ways to protect our EU membership?\u201d</p> <p>She said there had been welcome and substantive talks between UK and Scottish civil servants about embedding Scottish interests during the Brexit talks \u2013 a commitment given by Theresa May this summer; her new Brexit minister would press that agenda on her behalf. </p> <p>\u201cThe key priority has been to ensure that is a meaningful process that involves us directly in shaping the UK position that it reflects and protects our interests, including through outcomes which might differ from the position in the rest of the UK,\u201d Sturgeon said said on Tuesday.<br></p> <p>Public support for independence has only slightly risen since June\u2019s Brexit vote, despite Scotland\u2019s significant 62% vote in favour of the EU, while there has been no majority support for a fast second independence referendum, polls show. </p> <p>In July, after a short-lived jump in yes voters immediately following the Brexit vote, a YouGov poll found that 32% of Scots wanted to wait to see the terms of a Brexit deal before deciding on independence, while 53% would vote to remain in the UK despite leaving the EU. </p> <p>The first minister is for the first time facing public pressure from influential figures in the Scottish National party to accept that Scotland\u2019s best short-term interests could be better protected by accepting Brexit, by putting the quest for a fast independence referendum to one side.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Alex Neil, an influential former cabinet secretary, said in a recent Holyrood magazine <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.holyrood.com/articles/comment/idea-brexit-could-suddenly-push-scotland-towards-yes-vote-isn%E2%80%99t-supported-evidence\">article</a> that Scotland\u2019s powers over fisheries, home affairs, workers\u2019 rights and immigration could be greatly strengthened if the right Brexit deal was struck.</p> <p>But Sturgeon invited ridicule from opposition leaders by arguing that these economic costs proved that UK was no longer providing \u201ca safe harbour\u201d for Scotland. \u201cThe argument that the UK offers financial security to Scotland no longer holds water,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The first minister is to publish last year\u2019s official figures on the state of Scotland\u2019s public finances on Wednesday, which are expected to confirm a black hole in Scottish spending of about \u00a315bn. </p> <p>The Government expenditure and revenue Scotland (Gers) report will confirm that the slump in oil revenues has cut tax receipts, leaving Holyrood far more heavily dependent on UK Treasury support, increasing Scotland\u2019s structural deficit. </p> <p>Sturgeon said her anxieties were heightened by the absence of a post-referendum economic strategy from the UK government. However, Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, said her claims that the UK did not cushion the Scottish economy were laughable.</p> <p>\u201cThe first minister is in danger of losing the plot completely,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cHer own government\u2019s figures will show tomorrow that Scotland benefits from a multibillion union dividend.

While businesses are not yet signalling a weaker economic environment, consumers are clearly less confident after the Brexit-vote. This is the third decline in a row of confidence and it marks uncertainty over the current geopolitical and economic climate, but also about the personal economic situation as July\u2019s decline in confidence indicated. With indications from this morning\u2019s PMI that hiring might be slowing, that concern could be valid. If this were to be the case, that would likely slow down domestic demand in the Eurozone, which has been driving the recovery over recent quarters.</p> <p>The picture remains that optimism post-Brexit is premature. Although the PMI reached a 7-month high this morning, consumer confidence declines indicate that uncertainty does linger and that growth is likely to be affected by Brexit uncertainty as the process of the British exit drags along. Because of that, we remain of the opinion that growth rates are likely to decline in the second half of the year and that the ECB will announce further stimulus to counter the weakening growth environment shortly.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bc5ce6e4b048662988f5fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-23T14:26:57.525Z\">3.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The mixed signals from the eurozone should not trouble the European Central Bank too much, according to Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com.

  "<p>A former imam was bludgeoned to death in a children\u2019s playground by two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a> supporters who believed he practised \u201cblack magic\u201d, a court has heard.</p> <p>Jalal Uddin, 71, was murdered by two alleged Islamist extremists who harboured a \u201chatred and intolerance\u201d of his form of Islam, jurors were told.</p> <p>The respected community leader was targeted as he made his way home from a mosque in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, after months of being surveilled by his alleged killers, the jury heard.</p> <p>The accused \u2013 Mohammed Hussain Syeedy, 21, and Mohammed Abdul Kadir, 24 \u2013 were Isis supporters who developed a hatred of Uddin after discovering he practised a form of Islamic healing called ruqya, jurors were told.</p> <p>Opening the trial at Manchester crown court, the prosecutor, Paul Greaney QC, told jurors that Syeedy and Kadir \u201cstalked Jalal Uddin around the streets of Rochdale\u201d before Kadir launched a savage attack on the older man in a playground. Kadir unleashed \u201crepeated forceful blows\u201d to Uddin\u2019s head and mouth with a weapon believed to be a hammer, the court heard, leaving him with severe skull fractures.</p> <p>\u201cThese injuries were plainly not the result of a robbery gone wrong,\u201d Greaney said. \u201cOn the contrary, they were obviously the result of an attack that was planned \u2013 why else did the killer have a hammer with him in a children\u2019s park? \u2013 motivated by hatred and by a desire to humiliate Jalal Uddin and undoubtedly intended to kill or, at the very least, cause really serious harm.\u201d</p> <p>Greaney said the severe blows to Uddin\u2019s mouth were particularly significant. He said: \u201cThis was ... an attack driven by hate and the blow to the mouth was quite possibly the most symbolic of all: \u2018You will not say anything of which we disapprove.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The plot to murder Uddin began earlier this year, the court heard, after his alleged killers spent months conducting surveillance on the former imam while deciding how to \u201cparalyse\u201d his strain of Islam.</p> <p>Described as \u201cquiet, dignified and well respected,\u201d Uddin wore an amulet \u2013 known as a taweez \u2013 that some believe to protect the wearer against evil. However, Isis forbids the practice, considering it to be \u201cblack magic\u201d, the court heard.</p> <p>Six months before the killing, Uddin\u2019s books and notes on taweez were stolen from the Jalalia mosque in Rochdale, jurors were told. At the same time, one of Syeedy\u2019s friends sent a text message to the defendant saying he had gone on a \u201ctaweez raid\u201d at the mosque. When told his friend had found Uddin\u2019s \u201cstash\u201d, Syeedy replied: \u201cBurn it.\u201d</p> <p>Jurors were told there was \u201cclear and cogent\u201d evidence that Syeedy and Kadir supported Isis, including reams of jihadi propaganda recovered from Syeedy\u2019s iPhone. Jurors were shown photographs of the 21-year-old, who was born and raised in Rochdale, holding an Isis-style flag outside the Jalalia mosque where his victim prayed. In another, he wore a stab-proof vest outside the mosque. Other photographs showed Syeedy and two others holding a jihadi flag over a road sign in Rochdale that had been altered to read: \u201cWar Zone.\u201d</p> <p>On Syeedy\u2019s laptop, detectives found a poster saying \u201cDon\u2019t wear taweez\u201d and the message \u201cWhoever wears an amulet has committed shirk,\u201d the jury heard. Shirk is a sin of practising idolatry, the jury was told.</p> <p>As their hatred of Uddin grew, Syeedy and his associates plotted to have the Bangladeshi-born community leader deported by immigration services. However, that plan was abandoned after a photograph emerged of Uddin with the Rochdale MP, Simon Danczuk, outside the Jalalia mosque in December last year.</p> <p>Their hostility towards Uddin escalated that month when Kadir and others discussed killing him. In a Facebook message, Kadir wrote: \u201cExposing their Kufir [disbeliever] isn\u2019t sufficient as there are tooo many of them soo we may do what ever to paralyse them in sha Allah starting from the ring leader we know\u201d \u2013 a reference, the crown says, to Uddin.</p> <p>Kadir added: \u201cSoo please do made dua [prayers] that this happens and we do it in a systematic way so that we do not get caught.\u201d</p> <p>Syeedy sat alone in the dock as the court heard that his co-accused was on the run \u2013 possibly in Syria \u2013 after catching a flight to Istanbul, via Copenhagen, three days after the killing on 18 February.</p> <p>Jurors were told Syeedy accepted Kadir murdered Uddin and that he was with his accomplice before and after the killing. However, he will deny that he knew anything about the murder beforehand or that he supports Isis.</p> <p>The trial continues. </p>",

She gave up modelling in 1954 when she married and had her children, but she returned to the job after her husband died, in 1997, and now regularly appears in Vogue, Vanity Fair and Harper\u2019s Bazaar. Think of successful actors such as Judi Dench, Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith or Mary Berry, whose Great British Bake Off starts this week.</p> <p>And, of course, there are the men. We still enjoy the performances of Leonard Cohen and the Rolling Stones. We tolerate the Today presenter John Humphrys. And we marvel at David Attenborough, now aged 90.</p> <p>My own experience, and those of others, demonstrates to me that life \u2013 particularly working life \u2013 is a marathon, not a sprint. That is really important, especially for women. It is we who tend to bear the brunt of the responsibilities of caring for children or elderly relatives. Even though fathers are more hands-on today, who buys the shoes and makes the dental appointments? And as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/23/gender-pay-gap-average-18-per-cent-less-uk-women\" title=\"\">Institute for Fiscal Studies report</a> this week shows, the gender pay gap balloons after women have children.</p> <p>Many of us choose to be mothers or carers, but we also want to succeed in our jobs. Yet in a society that promotes the cult of youth, that is hard. In so many fields of work, people are always on the lookout for the next generation of talent, the emerging youthful stars, the new and ever younger people whom they want to place on the top of a pedestal.</p> <p>So people who want to succeed in their paid jobs feel that they can\u2019t take time out for other things. The obsession&#xa0;with youth means too many believe that if they haven\u2019t made it in their career by the time they are 35, they have failed.</p> <p>Nothing could be further from the truth. At a time when we are living longer than ever, we are being written off earlier. Of course we should promote young flair and new ideas but we should also value experience \u2013 and delight in talent and innovation at all ages.</p> <p>The cult of youth must be matched by&#xa0;a celebration of the continuing energy and contribution of others. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2015/jul/14/snp-mhairi-black-britain-youngest-mp-maiden-speech-video\" title=\"\">Mhairi Black, the SNP MP who gave a barnstorming maiden speech</a> last year when she was only 20, has as much to offer as <a href=\"http://www.marierimmer.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Marie Rimmer, the Labour MP for St&#xa0;Helens South and Whiston</a>, who joined parliament in the same year at the age of 69 after a successful career in&#xa0;local government.</p> <p>And we should stop putting pressure on people to race to the top before a hint of a grey hair appears on their heads. This pressure makes young people feel they must decide on their career choices&#xa0;too quickly, and then stick to them. At a time when people are likely to work for longer, they are being compelled to decide their future jobs at an ever younger age, and in doing so they are narrowing their options and limiting their opportunities.</p> <p>For women, the societal pressures are particularly tough. The time when we tend to have our children coincides with the point when society tells us we should be climbing towards the top of the career ladder. What should be the very best years of our lives rapidly become the hardest as we struggle to marry two important ambitions and feel guilt about not fulfilling either role properly. Yet if life is a marathon, why can\u2019t you coast in your paid job for a few years, while your children are young, and return to the competitive fray when they become more independent? Those few years out of the race do not diminish your ability to contribute or succeed later, when you are a little older.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/22/the-guardian-view-on-gender-pay-inequality-its-not-just-a-tennis-racket\">The Guardian view on gender pay inequality: it\u2019s not just a tennis racket | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I chose not to try for a seat in parliament until I was 50, when the youngest of my four children was 13. I certainly got to parliament later than my contemporaries, such as Jack Straw and David Blunkett. And when my husband fell ill with cancer I took a year\u2019s compassionate leave from my job as arts minister. Coming back after that year was hard because I had lost Henry, but resettling into work helped me through that period of grief. Indeed, I feel that both the time spent parenting and the time spent caring influenced \u2013 and improved \u2013 my approach to my job. I was more focused, more balanced and more appreciative of others.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to be critical of women who drive forward their careers at the same time as caring for children or relatives. We need to do all we can in terms of childcare and flexible working to make that possible. And there are many who don\u2019t have children, for whom developing their careers is the primary focus. But choice matters. Those who choose to spend some years more focused on their children or elderly relatives should not be shut out of advancement in their careers a little later, simply because of society\u2019s fixation with youth.</p> <p>Enabling women \u2013 and men \u2013 to progress outside these parameters must not become an excuse for sidelining the battle against continuing gender discrimination in the labour market.</p> <p>And if we respond to looking older by subjecting our bodies to facelifts and Botox in the hope that we can then present our youthfulness to the world, we are avoiding the problem. The fact is that healthier lifestyles and medical advances mean that we can maintain physical energy and mental alertness for longer. We have just got to stop linking an ageing appearance to a loss of physical and mental capability.</p> <p>The journey I have been on will be different for others, as I am not involved in manual work. But recognising the differences should not justify ignoring the need to challenge entrenched attitudes, and to enable people to take a long view of their years in work.</p> <p>As the world of work is transformed by new technology \u2013 for example, the people who currently wear themselves out stacking shelves will in the future most probably be monitoring robots doing that heavy lifting \u2013 it will become possible for people to do those manual jobs for longer.</p> <p>Our approach to this thorny issue is full of contradictions. We want people to work for longer, yet we write them off&#xa0;at an increasingly young age. We want women to be equal yet we continue to implement policies that stop that. We want to encourage new ideas but we dismiss many of those who have them.</p> <p>I know I have been very lucky. I shall be publishing my first book on my time as chair of the public accounts committee next month, just after my 72nd birthday. I am planning a second book, on immigration. But I want my luck to become the norm, so that what I managed to achieve becomes available to others. If life is a marathon, then none of us should have to damage our lives today because we are made to think there is no tomorrow.</p>",

It is new, difficult to pin down, and hard to understand. But it\u2019s important to try to get a handle on who is involved, what they believe, and what their possible influence might be on the immediate future of rightwing politics.</p> <h2>A movement that lives and breathes \u2013 and taunts \u2013 online</h2> <p>The alt- (or alternative) right has surged as a (so far) mainly online movement, occupying positions beyond the pale of many conservatives. It has no centralised organisation or official ideology \u2013 it has been <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/what-exactly-is-the-alternative-right/article/2000310\">described</a> as \u201cscattered and ideologically diffuse\u201d.</p> <p>The alt-right has been involved in fleeting street protests, but its online activities are well-organised and relentless. It recruits by opposing progressive ideas about gender, sexuality, and especially race and immigration. Adherents congregate on message boards like 4chan and 8chan, comment on websites like <a href=\"http://therightstuff.biz/\">the Right Stuff</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amren.com/\">American Renaissance</a>, and lurk on Twitter, where they taunt progressives (or \u201cshitlibs\u201d) and mainstream conservatives (\u201ccuckservatives\u201d).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15dbfa3e43ecf803331e39425ff01d361dec222d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15dbfa3e43ecf803331e39425ff01d361dec222d/0_128_4864_2919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen BannonFILE - In this Jan. 24, 2013 file photo, Executive Producer Stephen Bannon poses at the premiere of \u201cSweetwater\u201d during the 2013 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.

At the height of his Twitter-driven notoriety, Yiannopoulos wrote a <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/03/29/an-establishment-conservatives-guide-to-the-alt-right/\">manifesto</a> introducing the tendency to mainstream conservatives. But are Breitbart and Bannon really a part of the movement? Some of its most hardcore activists say no. </p> <h2>Race realism and ethno-nationalism: what the alt-right believes</h2> <p>Richard Spencer, who coined the term \u201calt-right\u201d in 2008, says he intended the term to describe a diverse, heterodox group whose members were \u201cdeeply alienated, intellectually, even emotionally and spiritually, from American conservatism\u201d. </p> <p>They were disillusioned at the end of the Bush presidency by Republican policies on war and immigration. They sought to draw on currents like the European New Right to transform what they saw as a moribund conservative movement. He and others connected with the succession of websites he edited \u2013 such as Taki magazine and alternativeright.com \u2013 wrote extensively, focusing the alt-right into a more definite ideology, with increasingly hardline ideas about race.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The alt-right has been involved in fleeting street protests, but its online activities are well-organised and relentless</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Spencer says that the term is still flexible, but affiliation has some minimum requirements. \u201cSomeone who is really alt-right recognises the reality of race, and the fact that race matters, and that race is an essential component of identity.\u201d</p> <p>Shane Burley, a journalist and researcher who has covered the far right extensively, says that Spencer\u2019s orientation \u201cis clearly under the umbrella of what we would call fascism\u201d. Spencer\u2019s so-called \u201crace realism\u201d underpins theories of racial hierarchy, and the idea that it has a basis in biology. Related ideas of \u201chuman biodiversity\u201d attempt to buttress the notion that race is destiny, and the primary organising category of society and history. <a href=\"http://www.radixjournal.com/\">Radix</a> is full of articles that link race with IQ or crime. This revival of previously discredited scientific racism is another recurring feature of alt-right thought.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a4364882f7174ff22edb6f0490cafee43d17504\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a4364882f7174ff22edb6f0490cafee43d17504/0_157_4186_2513/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milo Yiannopoulos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milo Yiannopoulos popularised the term \u2018alt-right\u2019 in a manifesto published on Breitbart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Burley says that the very fact that these ideas were once so thoroughly discredited opens up a gap for them to be promulgated again. \u201cRight now the arguments against their race and IQ position are less well-known, so they have the ability to plant the seed in the public imagination. </p> <p>\u201cAlmost all of the studies that they cite are marginal, construct-sweeping theories on the basis of very little data, and don\u2019t demonstrate the causal links that they claim for them.\u201d</p> <p>Other adherents emphasise their desire for racial separatism. Mike Enoch, from the site the Right Stuff, a major hub for the dissemination of alt-right materials, says: \u201cThe core principle, in my view, is ethno-nationalism, meaning that nations should be as ethnically and racially homogeneous as possible.\u201d</p> <p>As for Breitbart, Enoch thinks that it \u201cis the closest thing to sympathetic to our position that is out there in the mainstream, and there may be some people that share our views that work there, but the official editorial line of Breitbart is not alt-right\u201d.</p> <p>Chip Berlet, a veteran researcher of the far right and the coauthor of Right-Wing Populism in America, says that the idea of ethno-nationalism is derived from the European New Right. It\u2019s the claim that \u201cevery ethno-religious nationalist group has the right to its own homeland\u201d. </p> <p>This willingness to make open racial appeals is reflected in another fundamental claim on the alt-right that, as Spencer puts it, is the preponderance of \u201cJewish power and Jewish influence\u201d. This antisemitism dovetails with other kinds of conspiracy thinking \u2013 in the last week, alt-right Twitter accounts have been pushing the claim that Hillary Clinton is hiding <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HillarysLeaks?src=hash]\">serious health problems</a>.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Conspiracy theories make them into heroes who have exposed a plot.</p> <footer> <cite>Chip Berlet</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Berlet says antisemitism has \u201calways been a dividing line on the US right\u201d, separating the fringes from more mainstream groups, and \u201crightwing movements in the US have been obsessed with conspiracies since the Salem witch-hunts and the anti-Masonic scares. Nativist movements have always embraced the motif of subversion. It\u2019s normal for them: it makes them into heroes who have exposed a plot.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018A sense that white identity is under attack\u2019</h2> <p>Perhaps the most potent element of alt-right activism is the effort to build a sense of a specific white identity, and to claim that this identity is under attack. </p> <p>\u201cAnti-white animus in society at large is palpable,\u201d says Spencer. Demands for diversity in the workplace mean \u201cless white males in particular\u201d. More openly extreme alt-right accounts on Twitter talk about immigration in terms of \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WhiteGenocide?src=hash\">white genocide</a>\u201d.</p> <p>This sense of injured white identity is what defines the alt-right, according to Dan Cassino, a Fairleigh Dickinson University political scientist and the author of a new book on Fox News and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-American-Politics-Psychology/dp/1138900125/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\">American politics</a>. \u201cThe founding myth of the alt-right is that the disadvantaged groups in American politics are actually running things through a combination of fraud and intimidation. By doing this, they\u2019re actually oppressing white men.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201coriginal sin\u201d of current American politics, according to Cassino, is that neither liberals nor conservatives have a very good answer to the question of what is to be done about \u201cthe people who get screwed over\u201d by economic policies. <br></p> <p>If these sentiments are growing, it may mean a larger and more receptive audience for the more radical message of the alt-right. Adherents claim that the movement is expanding. </p> <p>Spencer does not have solid figures, but claims to have seen many new faces at his events, including young people who have been \u201credpilled\u201d \u2013 or racially \u201cawoken\u201d \u2013 in the last year. Enoch claims that the Right Stuff\u2019s suite of podcasts gets more than 100,000 listeners a week. </p> <p>It may be that a growing audience for these ideas is pulling Breitbart in a more hardline direction. Spencer calls Breitbart \u201calt-right lite\u201d, and says that its fundamental populism has led them to tentatively begin to express ideas similar to his. </p> <p>Berlet says just because Bannon is not a card-carrying member of the alt-right does not mean that progressives should be relaxed about Trump\u2019s erratic and intermittently fascist-sounding campaign. </p> <p>Berlet does not think that American politics has been in such a dangerous place vis-a-vis the far right for almost a century. For him, the parallels between the Trump campaign and the alt-right are \u201cthe most important pushback against having a multicultural and pluralistic society since the 1920s Klan\u201d.<br></p> <p><br><br></p>",

  "<p>What\u2019s been the fallout from the EU referendum so far?

It\u2019s a great idea \u2013 they have a great sense of humour. The only advice I have is come with loads of money, because New Zealand is really expensive. The one word I would use to describe New Zealand is easy \u2013 everything is so straightforward here. It\u2019s also stunningly beautiful, with great schools, great healthcare, good weather and great food. The negatives are our prime minister and his conservative government. Housing is also ridiculously expensive in Auckland. We have dreadful traffic and an expensive (and pretty hopeless) public transport system. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/new-zealand-the-tonic-for-brits-seeking-to-escape-brexit-blues\">More spacious without the Brexit: why Britons are flocking to New Zealand</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Robin, 40, from Wellington: \u2018Flights and beer are expensive\u2019<br></h2> <p>I welcome Brits \u2013 the more the merrier, I say. New Zealand is a wonderful place, but it does need more people here (from the UK or anywhere else). Be prepared for things to cost a fair bit more than the UK, especially travel and beer.</p> <p>The \u201cshort hop\u201d to Australia is nearly a four-hour flight, too, and there isn\u2019t the choice of going via Easyjet or Ryanair to keep the cost down. Beer in the city (I live in Wellington) is NZ$10 a glass (\u00a35.50), which is often annoyingly called a pint yet is more likely to be 350-425ml. Similarly, at the local nationwide chain supermarket nearby I recently paid NZ$28/kg (\u00a316/kg) for green beans and NZ$6.50 (\u00a33.60) for a cucumber.</p> <p>The weather, house prices, salaries and traffic vary massively up and down New Zealand, so your experience will depend on where you choose to live. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08b1b8939278a3d366157eaac458b5844bc72777\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08b1b8939278a3d366157eaac458b5844bc72777/0_0_2448_3264/750.jpg\" alt=\"Mount Ruapehu\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The picture I\u2019ve shared above is one of Mount Ruapehu, which you\u2019ll see when flying between Wellington and Auckland. It makes me smile and certainly beats driving up and down the M1. </p> <h2>Graeme Horne, 36, from Auckland: \u2018People here get up early and leave work early\u2019</h2> <p>It\u2019s great for Brits to come over here, as it will be pretty easy for them to feel immediately at home. For the locals, the society is not perfect. Poverty and hungry kids are a problem. The rate of immigration is causing some trouble \u2013 such as crazy house prices and pressure on jobs and services \u2013 and it\u2019s not inconceivable that immigrants will be blamed, as they have been in the UK. <br></p> <p>Make sure you understand what the job market is like before you move. Even Auckland \u2013 the biggest city \u2013 is relatively small, and the jobs that are in demand here are quite different from back home. There simply aren\u2019t a large number of well-paid office jobs, because the local market is so small and the country is very focused on the export of commodities rather than the local consumer. </p> <p>If you want to enjoy nature, sports, or simply a slower pace of life than the UK, then this is definitely the place for you. </p> <p>People here get up early, go to work around 8am, and leave work early compared to the UK. This makes it a really good place to have a more family-focused life as they tend to be heading home from work at 4-5pm. </p> <p>The worst thing by far is of course the isolation from friends and family. New Zealand really is as far away as you can possibly get! I\u2019ve heard of people starting a family and having to move back home because they needed to be closer to their support network. <br></p> <h2>Bob George, from Maungautoroto: \u2018Consider New Zealand if you want to add adventure to your life\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"926a6966d2963be4620dad7fb02c979e5db677eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/926a6966d2963be4620dad7fb02c979e5db677eb/0_0_2663_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Zealand road\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I am British. I moved to New Zealand in 2008; I rather wish I had moved here earlier. People are welcoming, both at the national level and on a personal level \u2013 you go into a shop and people chat. <br></p> <p>If you are thinking of moving to New Zealand, do it for positive reasons \u2013 forget what bugs you about Britain. Consider New Zealand if you want to add adventure to your life, if you get thrilled by stunning vistas, like an outdoor life, enjoy people and activities and want to develop as a person. <br></p> <p>New Zealand, like Britain, has a very mixed culture: I run a tennis group and get people from 20 different countries coming along (Auckland has a bigger mix of nationalities than most UK cities). Maori represent about 10% of the population and have impressive spiritual and social values. <br></p> <p>The worst parts of living here include the poor infrastructure. Earthquakes and volcanoes might be a challenge too. It\u2019s also very cut off \u2013 there are advantages in being 2,000km from the next nearest countries, but also a sense of isolation from the world.</p> <h2>Andy, from Auckland: \u2018House prices have spiralled out of control\u2019<br></h2> <p>I moved to New Zealand from the UK almost 20 years ago. In that time I\u2019ve seen house prices spiral out of reach for almost anyone but cash-rich investors. If you are serious about putting down roots here you will need to come to terms with house prices in the urban centres of around NZ$1m (\u00a3555,600). If you have children, a house in a desirable catchment area will set you back a fair bit more.</p> <p>There are undoubtedly benefits to relocating, however. For example, the weather is generally much more reliable in summer. Auckland in particular is an ethnically diverse and exciting city with many beautiful parks and beaches, which are never packed in the way an English beach such as Bournemouth is.</p> <p>There is crime here, and terrible congestion at times. The health service is also under the same strain as the NHS, although it is still largely free at point of use. As a tip for anyone thinking to make the move, remember that if someone says \u201cbring a plate\u201d on an invitation, be sure to put some food on it too. I got caught out by that one a couple of times early on. </p> <h2>Steve, 68, from Puhoi: \u2018Respect the local environment\u2019<br></h2> <p>I\u2019m not keen on New Zealand becoming overpopulated. I know that may sound very nimbyish but the fragile environment can only take so much. I worry about people coming here with little regard for how they might damage the surrounding area, so if you do come please find out about our original ecosystems and how some are in danger of total extinction. Learn to love what is unique to the country. <br></p> <h2>Hayley Ray, 27, from Auckland: \u2018I was shocked at the culture difference\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b293208df1501f0802a38aef3948328b6d2643d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b293208df1501f0802a38aef3948328b6d2643d/0_259_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Hayley Ray\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As a Brit working and living in New Zealand, I think it\u2019s amazing news that more British people are deciding to move here. New Zealand is still growing and developing. It\u2019s a fantastic opportunity for people who want to contribute to the growth of this wonderful country. You won\u2019t regret making the move. </p> <p>Raglan, a small seaside town 50km west of Hamilton, is so stunning when summer kicks in. However, I have fallen in love with Auckland. There is so much to do and see. Every suburb has its own unique personality, which makes Auckland a fantastic city to live in. </p> <p>When I first moved to New Zealand I was shocked at the culture difference. However, when you look for it the country has much to offer. Sure, you may not have the same music scene and high-street fashion shops, or the same access to watching the Olympics without having to pay for Sky. But you have amazing companies that manufacture goods by hand. In Britain this is becoming very rare. <br></p> <h2>Mick, 32, from Wellington: \u2018Leave bigotry behind\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ba2bbae820629be3b5f10e6cf9e48d34dc39be3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ba2bbae820629be3b5f10e6cf9e48d34dc39be3/0_0_1659_996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"view in New Zealand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Our country is populated by immigrants, so naturally they are most welcome here. My father\u2019s family immigrated here in the 1970s from Scotland, and they never looked back. When he\u2019s travelled overseas since he\u2019s told anyone who will listen to follow suit. Immigrants fit right in here, and there are many different ethnic community centres, newspapers and other assorted organisations.</p> <p>New Zealanders are prepared for all seasons. The further south you go, the colder it gets. In Auckland you can expect humidity and the occasional tornado; in Dunedin there are very cold winters, including snow. Everywhere has beautiful summers, though, and as the local saying goes: \u201cYou can\u2019t beat Wellington on a good day.\u201d</p> <p>Leave bigotry behind. Displays of racism, sexism, misogyny or any other forms of abuse are met swiftly with social justice, and even prosecution. We are a progressive nation: we have had openly gay and transsexual MPs, prostitution is legal here, and we legalised gay marriage long ago. </p> <p>We are a nation that proudly welcomes refugees, and often protests occur to increase the number we annually allow. Many different religions and ethnicities are represented by peaceful communities, and any harassment of them is quickly met with prosecution by an unforgiving justice system. </p> <h2>Kim, 56, from Wellington: \u2018Be prepared to slow down and say hi in the street\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"579d978dd99803aeb07e33a1418ccf7ddc35fba3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/579d978dd99803aeb07e33a1418ccf7ddc35fba3/0_0_2816_2112/1000.jpg\" alt=\"leaves\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Aotearoa, the north part of New Zealand, is full of migrants.

  "<p></p> <p>People from sub-Saharan Africa, particularly South Sudan, have reported facing a high level of discrimination in Australia, especially during contact with police.</p> <p>The finding comes from the ninth <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/24/australia-broadly-tolerant-but-pockets-of-intense-prejudice-remain-report-shows\">Australia Today report by the Scanlon Foundation</a>, which examines public opinion on social cohesion, trust, immigration, asylum seekers and ethnic, cultural and religious diversity.</p> <p> </p> <p>It found more respondents from African groups than other group indicated experiencing discrimination \u2013 77% of those born in South Sudan, 75% from Zimbabwe, 67% from Kenya, 60% from Ethiopia, 53% from Egypt.</p> <p> The report found: \u201cA relatively high proportion of South Sudanese, 59%, indicated that they had experienced discrimination when in contact with police over the last 12 months, 26% indicated that their property had been damaged, and 17% that they had been subject to physical attack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThese findings are consistent with a number of issues raised in focus group discussion.\u201d</p> <p>About 10,000 people were surveyed and the foundation held 51 focus group discussions involving 285 participants in Victoria.</p> <p>Bright Chinganya is the director of Carers of Africa, a non-profit organisation in Victoria which works to improve access to health and community services for refugees. He said he was not surprised by the findings of the Scanlon report.</p> <p>He said he recently had a group of teenagers come into his office saying they had been called a \u201cpack of ethnics\u201d while walking down the street.</p> <p>\u201cI know a few boys who get asked by police to show their tickets every time they are at the train station, and some report having their cars stopped by police frequently and being asked to show them their licence,\u201d Chinganya said.</p> <p>\u201cJust in the past two weeks I had parents come into my office because their kids in year 11 and 12 were picked up by police and accused of stealing from a shop, because CCTV footage apparently just showed them near the area. According to them, they were not responsible.\u201d</p> <p>Children commonly reported being bullied because of their ethnicity at school, he said.</p> <p>But Chinganya said he also believed some people from African backgrounds had a \u201cdefensive mechanism\u201d and sometimes wrongly believed they were being targeted. </p> <p>\u201cI think we need a lot of education to educate the Africans and non-Africans that this is not a place to discriminate against one another,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we need community engagement programs where groups can meet and have a fun night and games.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also good for African organisations and community leaders to invite non-Africans to their functions so they can come together to make these barriers fall down.\u201d</p> <p>Kot Monoah, chairman of the South Sudanese Community Association, told Guardian Australia that recent media reports about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/14/melbourne-street-brawl-blamed-on-apex-gang-after-moomba-festival\">Apex gang</a> \u2013 comprising young men in Melbourne\u2019s south-east from a range of backgrounds, including Sudanese, Pacific Islander, M\u0101ori and Caucasian \u2013 had not helped public and police perceptions of African people. Some of the responses to the gang\u2019s activities <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/15/melbourne-riot-claims-police-going-soft-on-african-youths-inaccurate-and-dangerous\">were criticised</a> for making unfair statements about African youth.</p> <p>Monoah, a personal injury lawyer, said Victoria police were making a concerted effort to improve their engagement with the African community. He said police attended a community seminar with the association on Saturday. However, some people at that forum said they had been discriminated against by police, he said.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, being targeted and over-policed in public areas like at bus stops and train stations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an awful feeling for any person in Australian society to go through that.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t people within the police engaging with the community really well, but that respectful engagement tends to occur at the top end of the leadership hierarchy and the lower end of the hierarchy don\u2019t get it right a lot of the time.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u201cSocial cohesion is not a destination,\u201d says Andrew Markus. \u201cWe don\u2019t get to the destination and say we\u2019ve done it. It\u2019s something we need to work at.\u201d</p> <p>Markus is a Monash University professor who oversees the <a href=\"http://scanlonfoundation.org.au/who-we-are/purpose-history/\">Scanlon</a> reports, a now regular and widespread exercise to measure social cohesion in Australia. Its latest survey was completed by more than 10,000 Australian-born and immigrant respondents, which makes it the largest parallel survey of its kind. It was a mix of survey and focus groups, where a small group is interviewed.<br></p> <p>The report \u2013 titled Australia Today \u2013 illuminates a people who are both hopeful and sometimes hurtful, largely cohesive but segmenting in a way that is becoming increasingly common in the midst of a communication revolution. It is fair to say we are mostly happy with our lives and what our country offers, though our background often determines our values. While Australian-born and overseas-born people value the freedom and democracy and the \u201cAustralian way of life\u201d, those born overseas place a much higher value on education, climate and diversity. Those taken in under humanitarian visas treasure our freedom and democracy more than the rest of us.</p> <p>We are not angels. There is discrimination, particularly towards the dark-skinned among us, Africans and Indigenous people. Muslims, particularly Muslim women, report high levels of discrimination. There is also a measure of reverse racism from migrants towards Australian-born people. As borders become more porous, the majority of us see ourselves as world citizens.</p> <p>As a whole, we trust doctors, hospitals and the Medicare system, as well as schools, police, the courts and government departments. Not so much employers or for that matter, trade unions. Let\u2019s not mention real estate agents. In their first five years on Australian soil, immigrants trust politicians and the parliament at much higher rates than the rest of the population. Then the things start to slide and they catch up with the attitudes of the mob.<br></p> <p>Coincidentally, the survey was conducted during Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s first five months in office \u2013 peak honeymoon. In the focus group studies, there is a recorded measure of relief within the Muslim community at the end of the \u201cdeath cult\u201d rhetoric of his predecessor Tony Abbott.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>When NZ citizens were asked what they least like about Australia, 28% nominate racism and discrimination</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere was a feeling that Abbott was not acknowledging diversity in the Muslim community and was alienating people because of that,\u201d Markus says.<br></p> <p>There is also an intense frustration about the media\u2019s portrayal of Islam for similar reasons. Indeed for Muslim respondents, their treatment by the media as an amorphous mass was a big issue. This is in spite of Muslim respondents having a high level of identification with Australia (72% identifying to a great or moderate extent and 75% indicating they were satisfied with life in Australia).<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-23T05:37:02/embed.html\" data-alt=\"experience of discrimination,\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-23T05:37:02/embed.html\">experience of discrimination,</a> </figure>  <p>Less predictable is the struggle of New Zealand citizens residing in Australia to fit in. Markus says the NZ special category visa holders report relatively high levels of negativity, trust and racism. They have high levels of workforce participation and just 13% are \u201cstruggling to pay the bills\u201d. But asked what they least like about Australia, 28% nominate racism and discrimination compared with 12% who nominate cost of living. Of the eight birthplaces considered in the survey, New Zealanders had the lowest levels of trust (10%) in Australian political parties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74cd903c303ebfa014e79667abec3b946e7c4d18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74cd903c303ebfa014e79667abec3b946e7c4d18/397_341_4531_2720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-immigration protesters clash with police in Coburg, Melbourne, in May 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-immigration protesters clash with police in Coburg, Melbourne, in May 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Smith/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the big shock for Markus was the discrimination experienced by people from sub-Saharan Africa, particularly South Sudan. They arrived during the Howard era and 77% reported some form of discrimination. Focus group participants reported unwitting discrimination from children shocked at their skin colour, employment discrimination and general \u201cdistancing\u201d by people on the street as well as police harassment. Views included \u201cthe cops are racist\u201d, \u201ctaxi drivers are racist\u201d, \u201ceverybody\u2019s racist\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In shops \u2018they follow you around ... they think you are going to steal ... even though you are about to pay.</p> <p>We go down the shopping centre to get some food, we get harassed, like telling us to move on.</p> </blockquote> <p>One told a story of a Sudanese man sent to work in an aged care facility.

And some of them start falling down ... \u2018get away from him, get away from him, he\u2019ll kill you too, he\u2019ll kill you too\u2019, they were saying that to my sister ... And my sister is like, she didn\u2019t even know what to say, she was shocked and they couldn\u2019t take that guy on, they had to send him back.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Recent arrivals feel a sense of belonging</strong></h2> <p>We are a multicultural nation, where nearly half of us are born overseas or have a parent born overseas. We welcome 190,000 people a year under the immigration program, with 68% in the skilled stream, 32% in the family stream. Add on top another 13,750 humanitarian places.</p> <p>Markus found the strength of identification with Australia remains at a high level among immigrants; 64% of recent arrivals (who came between 2001\u201015) indicated a sense of belonging to a \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cmoderate extent\u201d, compared to 63% of respondents two years earlier.</p> <p>They are optimistic, with only 6% of recent arrivals disagreeing with the statement that \u201cAustralia is a land of economic opportunity where in the long run, hard work brings a better life\u201d. (Though that does widen to 18% for those who arrived further back \u2013 between 1991 and 1995.)</p> <p>As you would expect, business (457) visa holders and independent skills reported better economic times, though the latter reported difficulty getting work. Online applications were difficult and for some, anglicising their name helped. One respondent said Australia was similar to a third world country where employment was based not on what you know but who you know.<br></p> <p>Harder though is economic freedom for humanitarian entrants. Of respondents, 36% were employed, while 20% were looking for work with a relatively high proportion reporting they were \u201cjust getting by\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d. Yet they remained positive about life in Australia with 81% satisfied with their life.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4d92f50ef6b043fcb440f1c5596ed23f232e1ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4d92f50ef6b043fcb440f1c5596ed23f232e1ed/0_54_4463_2677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mother and a young girl attend a pro-refugee rally outside the Immigration Office in Brisbane in February 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mother and a young girl attend a pro-refugee rally outside the Immigration Office in Brisbane in February 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Discrimination the eye opener</strong></h2> <p>Every time Markus goes into the field, his team is refining the data, watching the trends, thinking about new movements. This time, he was keen to tap into the African immigrant experience. In their last 2013 recent arrival survey, they got only 25 respondents born in sub-Saharan countries other than South Africa.<br></p> <p>With effort, Scanlon received 166 South Sudanese respondents out of nearly 500 from Sub-Saharan countries. South Sudanese arrivals peaked in Australia from 1996 to 2005 in the Howard years under the humanitarian visa program. Of the respondents, 76% were satisfied with their life and 58% said life was more positive than they had expected.<br></p> <p>Balanced against that outlook was high unemployment rates among respondents (23%), low levels of personal trust (4%) compared with the average for recent arrivals (37%) and low levels of trust in police (26%).</p> <p>But it was experience of discrimination which was the real eye opener for Markus. In the previous 12 months, experience of reported discrimination was at 60% for Ethiopians, 67% for Kenyans, 75% for Zimbabweans and 77% for South Sudanese.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I didn\u2019t think we would get 77% experience of discrimination.</p> <footer> <cite>Andrew Markus, Monash University professor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Markus says the numbers show the issues may be worse than he first thought. Almost as shocking is the realisation that the numbers may be underestimated.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think we would get 77% experience of discrimination and it\u2019s the way people talk about it that is surprising,\u201d he said.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-23T05:34:39/embed.html\" data-alt=\"discrimination selected african countries\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-23T05:34:39/embed.html\">discrimination selected african countries</a> </figure>  <p>Is this the most recent migrant group again reflecting back? The same survey found 59% of Indigenous Australians reporting experiences of discrimination.<br></p> <p>Markus, who has long been watching these trends, says the levels of culturally intolerant people in Australia are probably more like 20% of the population, instead of the 10% he was inclined to think.</p> <h2><strong>Technology brings homeland closer</strong></h2> <p>In the postwar years, migrant communities were almost completely cut off from their home towns and villages. Letters had to suffice and perhaps a phone call twice a year with the family gathered around. The communication revolution has changed that. Of arrivals between 2011 and 2015, 71% keep in contact with family or friends by SMS or social media daily or several times a week.

Emergency workers are operating on the frontline of the crisis, and the senate is leading a much improved coordination effort to overcome institutional and logistical hindrances to getting aid to the neediest. We are urgently seeking to pass a motion to secure an additional \u00a3215m in aid to tackle the emergency, and we are engaging with humanitarian organisations and the international community to ensure food reaches those who most need it as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Yet while Nigeria must do far more to coordinate relief efforts, we cannot tackle the crisis alone, just as we cannot tackle its root causes \u2013 poverty, insecurity and instability \u2013 without a concerted effort from, and renewed partnership with, the international community. We need far greater support from overseas to ensure that, first, people are able to leave the camps and live their lives safely and securely, and, second, those who have suffered so much are effectively rehabilitated.</p> <p>This crisis will not simply go away, and neither will its instigators. The UN has rightly identified the Lake Chad region <a href=\"http://news.trust.org/item/20160524181019-53nxy/\">as the world\u2019s most neglected humanitarian crisis</a>.</p> <p>It is not a coincidence that this situation has developed in Borno and north-east Nigeria.

Poverty, malnourishment and isolation form a perfect breeding ground for Boko Haram to recruit desperate individuals and turn them into their latest weapon against humanity.</p> <p>Islamic State is reportedly recruiting members from European refugee camps. Kenya has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/kenya-close-worlds-biggest-refugee-camp-dadaab\">announced plans to close Dadaab</a>, the world\u2019s largest refugee complex, due to fears that al-Shabaab is recruiting on an unprecedented scale.</p> <p>This is more than just an immediate humanitarian challenge for Nigeria.

But it also means diversifying the economy to attract greater foreign investment to develop Nigeria\u2019s fledgling but hugely promising industries. Ultimately, it means sharing the proceeds of future growth more evenly throughout the country, not least in the north-east.</p> <p>Nigeria will act to address the causes of the catastrophe. The senate has advanced plans for a development commission that will initially focus on the crisis, and it has made facilitating economic growth and attracting greater investment its chief priorities.</p> <p>All legislative efforts will be geared towards encouraging investment for social development. Only through deeper partnership with the international community can we facilitate the necessary economic reforms to secure Nigeria\u2019s future prosperity and only through sharing the proceeds of economic growth can we ensure such a crisis never takes root in Nigeria again.</p> <ul> <li><em>Bukola Saraki is president of the Nigerian senate</em></li> </ul>",

The appeal said: \u201cAt the Champions League match with Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva on 17 August 2016, the Green Brigade and fans throughout Celtic Park flew the flag for Palestine.</p> <p>\u201cThis act of solidarity has earned Celtic respect and acclaim throughout the world. It has also attracted a disciplinary charge from Uefa, which deems the Palestinian flag to be an \u2018illicit banner\u2019. In response to this petty and politically partisan act by European football\u2019s governing body, we are determined to make a positive contribution to the game and today launch a campaign to #matchthefineforpalestine.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"96f6c98f4e1d89dc50611348fd9877101743ffe8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96f6c98f4e1d89dc50611348fd9877101743ffe8/0_259_2322_2902/800.jpg\" alt=\"Hapoel fans at Celtic\u2019s ground.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hapoel fans at Celtic\u2019s ground.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wallace/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The money raised will be divided between <a href=\"http://www.map-uk.org/\">Medical Aid for Palestinians</a>, a UK-based charity, and the Lajee Centre, a sports and arts project in the Aida refugee camp in Bethlehem. The funds will be used to help launch a football team called Aida Celtic and buy kit.<br></p> <p>The Lajee Centre <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zdm09DOieHc\">posted a video</a> thanking donors for \u201cone of the biggest solidarity actions in European football history\u201d. In Aida refugee camp, where thousands of Palestinians live in the shadow of the huge separation wall built by Israel, centre director Salah Ajarma said the support had been incredible. </p> <p>\u201cThe flags at Celtic were one of the biggest demonstrations of support for Palestine and the Palestinian people and the Israeli occupation at a football match that I can remember,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>Ajarma was tracking the amount raised by the appeal in his phone. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s reached almost \u00a3100,000 pounds. I check every half hour and it\u2019s more and more.\u201d</p> <p>The relationship between Celtic and Lajee goes back six years, and has seen players from the centre, which runs football courses and activities for some 80 girls and boys, visit Glasgow. </p> <p>The connection, said Ajarma, was made initially by Palestinian activist Mohammed al-Azrak, who splits his time between the occupied territories and Glasgow. </p> <p>Wearing the green and white striped Celtic strip - a gift presented when he visited the club\u2019s ground in Glasgow - Ajarma Aboud Azam, who plays and coaches junior players, said: \u201cI hope the money will help improve the talent of the children who are playing football in the camp. The donation from Celtic will help our players evolve.\u201d </p> <p>Yazar Ikkhlayel, 21, another player involved with the youth centre who has visited Glasgow, said he was proud that people wanted to show solidarity with Palestine. \u201cI was amazed when I visited Glasgow. It has a real sense of social cohesion. And when Glasgwegians find out your are from Palestine they ask if there is any way that they can help.\u201d</p> <p>Football fans in Aida were not sure whether they would be able to watch the match. \u201cWe are boycotting Israeli television and we are not sure if it will be shown on Al Jazeera,\u201d said Ajarma. </p> <p>Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said that Scottish fans would not be allowed to wave Palestinian flags at Hapoel\u2019s stadium. \u201cObviously it won\u2019t be allowed \u2013 that is for sure. The flags would of course be taken off them,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/israeli-cops-warn-celtic-fans-8674111\">told the Daily Record</a>. \u201cThis is a professional football game and not a political opportunity.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn terms of the football game, it\u2019s not going to add to the atmosphere and might start up tensions which could lead to other issues. Our aim is to prevent any incidents from taking place as a result of any unnecessary provocative behaviour by any of the fans.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be security measures implemented to prevent those sorts of incidents from taking place. It is not illegal to have a Palestinian flag in Israel but provocation by fans of either side is, and we will not tolerate it.\u201d</p> <p>No one at Celtic football club was available for comment, but the team\u2019s manager, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3749190/UEFA-open-disciplinary-proceedings-against-Celtic-Palestinian-flags-displayed-against-Israeli-Hapoel-er-Sheva.html\">Brendan Rodgers, said last week</a> that he was looking forward to the second leg in Israel. \u201cI have never been there.

We shared something neither of us ever had before. </p> <p>Circumstances conspired for us to be together. Shortly after, I found myself on a jet, headed for Cleveland, Ohio.

Our wedding song was (and is) Metallica\u2019s Nothing Else Matters. Tells you all you need to know.</p> <p>After arriving, I got a job driving an ice cream truck through the housing projects in Painesville, about 40 miles from Cleveland. That was an eye-opener. Abject poverty, astounding violence. A guy came up to the truck, waved a little bag full of white, crystalline powder at me, demanded $20 and an ice cream. I said he\u2019d got it wrong: he gave me money, I gave him an ice cream. He looked at me like I was crazy, grinned at me with a mouth full of gold, shook his head and left.

They were patient with my serial post-submission tweaking and have enabled me to fix my smattering of proofing errors in the initial ebook version, the majority resulting from too much late-night haste.</p> <p>I\u2019ve learned a lot about self-publishing, mostly from making lots of mistakes: I delivered my manuscript 10 days after the election, but would have saved time in the end by giving myself 20; I discovered that if I set a recommended retail price of \u00a35, as planned, I would actually lose money each time someone bought one through Amazon (which is why it\u2019s ended up at \u00a36). Only now am I grasping the bleeding obvious relationship between the size of the book\u2019s font and its production cost.</p> <p>These errors have had no deterrent effect. Having contrived the imprint name Double Q Books \u2013 it\u2019s a play on my east London postcode \u2013 I seem to have started work on another short volume, exploring Boris Johnson\u2019s legacy as mayor. This time, I\u2019ll need to do the numbers with more care. I\u2019ve never expected to make money from Zac versus Sadiq, at least in the short term, but it would be nice not to make too much of a loss.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/16/100-days-of-sadiq-khan-london-mayor\">100 days of Sadiq Khan: 'I feel a sense of relief that we have a sensible mayor'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It will be clear by now that as a business enterprise, Zac versus Sadiq has been, to put it mildly, haphazard.

London Citizens is a multi-faith social action group, originating in the East End. The fervour and high emotion of the Mayoral Assembly can both exhilarate and unnerve even seasoned politicians, as formidable clerics and youthful idealists politely but sternly invite them to sign up to the Citizens\u2019 goals and work with them to see they are achieved.</em></p> <p><em>It was an occasion made for Khan. The 6,000 mostly young people banked round the hall gave him a big welcome as he mounted the stage constructed at its centre and added a Muslim greeting to his general big hello. The Citizens\u2019 Assembly offer is one that candidates refuse at the cost of a polite but very public dressing down. Khan\u2019s 50% affordable policy on housing and his stridency on low pay fitted his hosts\u2019 list of requirements more precisely than those of Goldsmith, who had no option but to finesse his less compliant policies as best he could.</em></p> <p><em>After young refugees had spoken of their yearning to remain in the city where they had grown up, Khan said to loud cheers that in his role as Tooting MP he had just the other night helped try to change the government\u2019s Immigration Bill so that Britain could help more unaccompanied young refugee children stranded in mainland Europe. That was the reason given for his missing an important National Housing Federation hustings held on the same evening as the Commons vote. Goldsmith hadn\u2019t been at the housing debate either, but his excuse, according to his stand-in, was that he had to meet someone in Hillingdon.</em></p> <p><em>At the end, Goldsmith left quietly in the company of [his campaign chair] Nick de Bois and almost no one else. He had the air of lost stork trying to find its way back to Kew. Meanwhile, on the other side of the venue, the diminutive Khan disappeared into a crush of well-wishers, camera crews and selfie-seekers. He\u2019d empathised. He\u2019d rocked the house.</em></p> </blockquote> <p></p> <h2>Buy the book</h2> <p>To order a copy of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/zac-versus-sadiq.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Zac Versus Sadiq by Dave Hill</a> for \u00a36, go to <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

  "<h2>Australia</h2> <p>Our performance was below expectations overall. We made the mistake of peaking for the Olympic trials and the world championship in an Olympic year which meant many performance in Rio seemed flat. We seemed unable to deal with the added pressure, and we seemed to lack the depth required when coming up against some really impressive competitors. My highlight was definitely the Australia women\u2019s rugby sevens gold medal. </p> <p>Australia\u2019s favourite sports \u2013 AFL, cricket, netball and surfing \u2013 are not Olympic sports, which means the country\u2019s best athletes don\u2019t participate. The future will be bright though - we\u2019re a sports mad country and always will be. But we may need to rethink funding and preparation for future Games. <strong><em>Xavier</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47ce318b8f09edc8547972c8ef0903b80a8ac317\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47ce318b8f09edc8547972c8ef0903b80a8ac317/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australia celebrate after winning gold in the rugby sevens event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Davies/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Belgium</h2> <p>We didn\u2019t really exceed expectations as we haven\u2019t had more than 10 medals since 1924. But we can happily say that this summer\u2019s tally of six medals is the best since Atlanta 20 years ago. The reason for this relative success is the will to build on the legacy of the past Games and not just forget a sport when nobody is performing in it. </p> <p>Many were surprised to see Nafissatou Thiam win the heptathlon, but athletics in Belgium has been on the up since the success of Kim Geveart, the Borlee family in the past years and especially Tia Hellebaut\u2019s gold medal in 2008. We were also successful in the cycling and in the men\u2019s hockey. Our hockey team has been allowed to improve over time. </p> <p>Unfortunately Belgium is tied up in a number of political divisions between the north and the south of the country, meaning that we have more or less two federations for each sport in addition to a national federation. This means the funding is managed and used differently in the north and south. Moreover don\u2019t have the same national centres of sport excellence that you would find in France or Great Britain. We have been promised one of these for several years, but it has yet to materialise. This would probably be key for Belgium to move forward from the relatively successful Rio Games to the next level. <strong><em>Marc Hennequart</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9e6d67aea3deef7fbf3df09a7c48e159f17e539\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9e6d67aea3deef7fbf3df09a7c48e159f17e539/0_0_5082_3373/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thiam\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nafissatou Thiam celebrates her heptathlon victory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthias Hangst/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Canada</h2> <p>Canada has benefited from the emergence of many rising stars and we exceeded expectations in Rio. There has been plenty of government and corporate support in preparation for the Games, which has paid off. Our performances in the swimming and athletics were particularly impressive. Multi-event track and field is also high-profile thanks to bronze medals for Brianne Theisen-Eaton in the heptathlon and Damian Warner in the decathlon. Their efforts will inspire young athletes to persevere. </p> <p>Now we need to continue developing 16-year-old swimming sensation Penny Oleksiak and 21-year-old sprinter Andre De Grasse. In women\u2019s football 17-year-old Deanne Rose became the youngest woman to score at the Olympics as Canada beat the hosts in the bronze medal final. We see a very bright future. <strong><em>James Mihaychuk</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"199348a2123ca141a186042964ffb1aac395724f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/199348a2123ca141a186042964ffb1aac395724f/0_0_4000_2672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oleksiak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Penny Oleksiak poses with her gold medal after the women\u2019s 100m freestyle final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean Catuffe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Colombia</h2> <p>We performed much better than expected and were above other countries of a similar level in terms of development and population. Gold medal winner Caterine Ibarg\u00fcen has become the most carismatic athlete in Colombia right now. A new generation of Colombians looked determined to succeed and accomplish their dreams, and our future prospects look good if the future governments maintain the support for athletes in our country. <strong><em>Luis Gabriel</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9016c651e424cd938cc7058990e2c40aee015765\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9016c651e424cd938cc7058990e2c40aee015765/0_0_3000_2068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caterine Ibarguen celebrates with her gold medal after winning the Women\u2019s Triple Jump on the tenth day of the Rio Olympics.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caterine Ibarguen celebrates with her gold medal after winning the Women\u2019s Triple Jump on the tenth day of the Rio Olympics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Croatia</h2> <p>We\u2019ve had our best Olympics so far medal wise, with our athletes producing many inspired performances.

Sara Slott Pettersen won our first female athletics medal in 68 years and Lasse Norman Hansen managed to win two medals in the otherwise totally Team GB-dominated track cycling events. Pernille Blume won a very surprising gold in 50m freestyle, which several of our other medallists have since claimed was a massive inspiration for their performances. We can be very proud of that. <strong><em>Thomas Monberg</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22aa6fd4c999f5508dc6a0299cbf86bfff09e83d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22aa6fd4c999f5508dc6a0299cbf86bfff09e83d/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denmark\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sara Slott Petersen celebrates winning the silver in the women\u2019s 400m hurdles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Fiji</h2> <p>The Olympics were a success for Fiji as the country won its first ever medal by striking gold in the men\u2019s rugby sevens.

Since the success of London 2012 investment has increased with improved facilities and hiring of more coaches, especially within track and field disciplines. Mo Farah impressed me in particular along with our cyclists. It\u2019s a fantastic achievement to hold on to second place in the medals table, when everyone expected China to catch us eventually. </p> <p>I hope the government understands the importance of sports starting at junior level and how that can make a difference. Sport is a ongoing work in progress. It can only improve and reap the benefits if there is the right level of investment, infrastructure, equipment and coaching. Without these, we would not be witnessing the success we\u2019re having. <strong><em>Seb Chowdhury</em></strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ba893b1ef0313ad47a83f94739da8c61c6a7e88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ba893b1ef0313ad47a83f94739da8c61c6a7e88/0_0_3500_2421/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mo Farah\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mo Farah with his two gold medals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>India</h2> <p>The success this year was sending the largest contingent of athletes in our history to the Olympics. We also sent the largest female contingent. Unfortunately we failed to match this with success in terms of medals. Indian women provided exceptional performances for the future. This is the path we should choose. It has awakened a much-needed discussion on careers around Olympic sports. In time we should see a jump in demand for Olympic sports. Sufficient coaching and training remains the biggest challenge for our athletes, and there\u2019s a lot to improve on. <strong><em>Sagar Birkar</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfd257a94753d2f1a5259f0143ac69a1ca5a1528\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfd257a94753d2f1a5259f0143ac69a1ca5a1528/0_0_2886_2082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"India\u2019s Pusarla V.

The problem is boxing was meant to account for 75% of Ireland\u2019s medals. The loss of coach Billy Walsh to the USA clearly had some impact, but bad luck has also been a factor. </p> <p>In reality world champion Michael Conlan did win a medal but for whatever reason the judges awarded the bout to Russia. He had a great chance of gold but leaves empty handed through no fault of his own. Medal hope Joe Ward was also very unfortunate to exit as a result of two strange point deductions. Other out-of-the-ring factors also played a role with gold medal favourite Paddy Barnes struggling to make the weight and the previously unbeatable Katie Taylor having coaching issues this year.</p> <p>The O\u2019Donovan brothers, who won Ireland\u2019s first ever rowing medal, and sailor Annalise Murphy should be given credit for their brilliant silver medal performances. The hockey team and Thomas Barr, who came fourth in the 400m hurdles, deserve praise too. There might be a small uplift in the rowing after the O\u2019Donovan\u2019s exploits, on and off the water. In terms of the future I don\u2019t think things will change in any obvious ways. Everyone will go back to watching football, rugby and Gaelic Games until Tokyo 2020. <strong><em>Daniel James</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3eea064d3bff719fd9d894683cecd27575482bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3eea064d3bff719fd9d894683cecd27575482bc/0_0_3936_2623/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Annalise Murphy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Annalise Murphy celebrates winning silver in sailing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Israel</h2> <p>We performed better than four years ago that\u2019s for sure. While in London the Israeli delegation returned empty handed, but in Rio two judo competitors, Ori Sasson and Yarden Gerbi, both won bronze. In the long jump Hannah Kanayezva-Minenko finished a very respectful fifth. The two medals have brought a lot of happiness to people after the disappointments of London 2012, and I\u2019m very happy with the spirit of the Israeli athletes who had to fight extremely hard for their success. <strong><em>Ezra Kloot</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"744eef2a337d08468f62de36f0bec8828343dacd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/744eef2a337d08468f62de36f0bec8828343dacd/0_0_4096_2850/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Israel\u2019s Yarden Gerbi celebrates with supporters after winning against Miku Tashiro of Japan in the women\u2019s -63kg bronze final bout at the Carioca Arena 2 in the Olympic Park in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 09 August 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"696\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yarden Gerbi celebrates after winning her bronze medal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Kenya</h2> <p>I\u2019m extremely proud of our team at Rio. The relentless training and a strong will to retain the dominance in long distance runs has paid off, but to widen our scope to sprints and other field events has really impressed me. For David Rudisha to recover from injury and double his Olympic and world champion glory in the 800m was spectacular. He is a true hero. </p> <p>A lot of mismanagement is currently plaguing our athletic federation. If we curb this, we can perform even better in Tokyo.

For us silver and bronze medals are enough to make the country proud. One of the main reasons that contributes to our country\u2019s success is the endless support from Malaysians. We are from all walks of life \u2013 different races and religious beliefs and so are our athletes. A special mention goes to our outstanding badminton pair Goh V Shem and Tan Wee Kiong. I\u2019m confident Malaysia will continue to produce athletes who always strive for excellence. <strong><em>Aisyah Sinclair</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75b76db04960e11665ccaa89ee69215a69bd6982\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75b76db04960e11665ccaa89ee69215a69bd6982/0_0_4398_3216/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malaysia\u2019s Goh V Shem and Tan Wee Kiong display their silver medals for men\u2019s badminton doubles at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Friday, Aug. 19, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"731\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malaysia\u2019s Goh V Shem and Tan Wee Kiong display their silver medals for men\u2019s badminton doubles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Mexico</h2> <p>We did very well considering there has been next to no support from the government to most of the athletes. Mexico\u2019s athletes haven\u2019t met the expectations we had though. In recent years many of them like boxer Misael Rodriguez have lost their funding. He had to ask for money in the streets to pay for his trip to Rio and had to compete wearing an improvised uniform because he wasn\u2019t provided with one. The fact he ended up winning a bronze medal is incredible. </p> <p>Mexican athletes need broader support from the government. It is frustrating to see how our athletes do their best to compete with people who have clearly had better preparation. While other countries give their athletes the support that allows them to train 24/7, Mexican competitors manage to combine a busy work schedule with the training they can get in their spare time - training they have to pay for themselves of course, since the CONADE only funds selected people and disciplines. We will never do any better without the necessary help and support from the top.<strong><em> Imelda Mej\u00eda Osornio</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb96a756c49f1f0a75679c76399fa392afbe6f61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb96a756c49f1f0a75679c76399fa392afbe6f61/0_0_4096_2603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Misael Uziel Rodriguez of Mexico poses with his bronze medal on the podium of the men\u2019s Middle (75kg) competition of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, 20 August 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Misael Uziel Rodriguez poses with his bronze medal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valdrin Xhemaj/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Netherlands</h2> <p>While the judo and swimming were mostly disappointing, except the golden races of Sharon van Rouwendaal and Ferry Weertman, the women\u2019s handball and volleyball was very exciting.

Most of the players are young so they can participate in four years\u2019 time as well. </p> <p>I think in judo and swimming they trained too hard in preparation of the Rio Olympics.

Drysdale, Carrington, the men\u2019s pair and the sailors have done an amazing job. A lot of the less experienced rowing crews didn\u2019t quite live up to expectation, but they\u2019ll be surely targeting Tokyo as a main event. </p> <p>The biggest disappointment was the men\u2019s rugby sevens. Four years ago you would have locked them in for gold, now they\u2019re nowhere close. New Zealand has put too much importance on effectively meaningless games for the all blacks above Olympic success. On the whole though there was a record medal haul and some great performances. There might be a bit more interest in sailing and rowing. The problem with these sports is that they\u2019re quite expensive to get into so maybe the government can look at programs to allow more people to take these sports up. <strong><em>Chris</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a54ad0d0cc6b335e0159f309dc873a171de49651\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a54ad0d0cc6b335e0159f309dc873a171de49651/0_0_3363_2533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mahe Drysdale shows his gold medal to his daughter Bronte.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"753\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rower Mahe Drysdale shows his gold medal to his daughter Bronte.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barria/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Portugal</h2> <p>We were competitive in all the events we participated in, but we were just not good enough to get on to the podiums.

But we achieved these placings on a small fraction of the funding other nations enjoy. We possess the raw quality but don\u2019t have the resources that other more economically sound countries do. </p> <p>I think we will still be able to get European championship titles in athletics, as well as good results in martial arts, but the medal count will still look pretty grim in Tokyo unless serious, decisive and very unlikely investment is made into sports practice in general and competitive sport in particular.<em><strong> Tiago</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"192c72ae896bf4ab9ac6472f7f5aad4915aec80c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/192c72ae896bf4ab9ac6472f7f5aad4915aec80c/0_0_4603_3100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portugal\u2019s Ricardo Ribas reacts after the Men\u2019s Marathon at the 2016 Rio Olympics.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ricardo Ribas after the marathon event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Singapore</h2> <p>We craved a medal in Rio and Joseph Schooling delivered a historic gold in the men\u2019s 100m butterfly event.

Dedicated athletes such as javelin thrower Sunette Viljoen in her fourth Olympics won her first medal, which shows youngsters not to give up.

Our only minor hope was sailing and Pablo Cuevas in tennis, but neither had a good week, with conditions going against them. But we had the best historic result in athletics with Emiliano Lasa\u2019s sixth place in long jump, which is an unexpectedly great thing, especially considering he\u2019s a guy who has to ask money from his parents to pay rent in Brazil. Not too many disappointments as we didn\u2019t expect much and one big unexpected joy, so this was an acceptable Olympics for us.</p> <p>The future looks mediocre at best sadly. There\u2019s no funding whatsoever for athletes, who really struggle to make a living, let alone compete at the highest level. Obviously there\u2019s other priorities but there\u2019s no base at all for sports other than football and that will leave us way behind in every aspect as nobody wants to practice something different.

  "<p>North Korea responded to the defection of a prominent diplomat and his family last week with typical hyperbole and inconsistency. </p> <p>First, a spokesman for the government\u2019s Ministry of Truth told newspapers that Thae Yong-ho <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/18/north-korean-diplomat-was-bribed-or-coerced-into-defecting-pyong/\">had been a victim of a South Korean plot</a>.

Unhappy with Kim Il-sung\u2019s policies, on 16 October 1959 Yi applied for political asylum in the Soviet Union. His chances of success were high, since the Soviet government had previously granted asylum to North Korean officials and intellectuals who had run away from the wave of terror unleashed by Kim after the collapse of the opposition in 1957-58. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c7e5dc0b75b25aab445b0c91018c9fc0002e493\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c7e5dc0b75b25aab445b0c91018c9fc0002e493/0_157_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Jong-un inspecting a pig farm near Pyongyang.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Jong-un inspecting a pig farm near Pyongyang.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ho Str/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yi went into in Moscow.

Their claims \u2013 and their inconsistency \u2013 are reminiscent of what we have heard in the last few days.</p> <p>MS Kapitsa, who at that time was the deputy head of the First Far Eastern Department, and responsible for North Korea, was visited by Pak T\u014fk-hwa, an official at the North Korean embassy in Moscow. </p> <p>Pak said Yi had broken all contact with the North Koreans and told Kapitsa that he was politically suspicious. He told the Soviets that Yi had been born in South Korea, and that he had also lived in Japan and Manchuria, hoping this would prompt the Soviet authorities to think twice about assisting him. .</p> <p>Other claims soon followed, including that Yi had been proven to be a Japanese spy and that he was having an affair with a Russian woman whom he wanted to marry despite already having a Korean wife.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/11/kim-jong-un-north-korea-yeonmi-park\">Kim Jong-un is no joke, says North Korean defector</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Days after his disappearance, on an early afternoon in downtown Moscow, Yi was ambushed by North Korean operatives, beaten and pushed into an embassy car. The next day he was sent back to Pyongyang by plane, never to be heard from again.</p> <p>Back in Pyongyang, then Soviet Ambassador AM Puzanov met with Pak S\u014fng-ch\u2019\u014fl, the newly appointed North Korean foreign minister, to object. However Pak provided the Soviet side with yet another story. He said the abduction was intended because authorities in Pyongyang had ordered the Moscow embassy to send Yi home, due to serious \u201cirregularities\u201d in his behaviour. But they allegedly did not expect that their diplomats would kidnap the musician.</p> <p>This version is remarkably similar to what Kim told Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi when in 2002 they met to discuss the Japanese citizens <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/12/north-korea-systematically-abducted-foreign-citizens-japanese-paper-claims\">who were abducted in the 1970s and 80s</a>. Kim said that those abductions had been carried out by overzealous officials on their own initiative, without any knowledge of the central government.</p> <p>The tradition of dealing with defections with smears and wild accusations is well established \u2013 and so it the tradition of being inconsistent. Even accusing Thae of molesting children is similar to what North Korean diplomats said about Yi almost 70 years ago. </p> <p>While back then they accused their political opponent of espionage \u2013 the worst crime in the eyes of the Soviet officials, who were their target audience \u2013 this time once again they were well aware of the claims that would cause the most shock and disgust.</p> <p><em>A version of this article first appeared on NK News \u2013<a href=\"https://www.nknews.org/2016/08/netflix-style-video-on-demand-comes-to-north-korea-state-tv-shows/\">North Korean news</a></em></p>",

Political instability and President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s divisive rule aside, since the Syria conflict started in 2011 jihadi groups have established themselves alongside Turkey\u2019s border with Syria.</p> <p>Gaziantep has become a safe haven for Isis, to which Saturday\u2019s attack is attributed and the terror group is reported to have significant supporters and resources in the city. This infrastructure would not exist were it not for Turkey\u2019s careless indifference to jihadi groups, using their territory as a launching pad for attacks against the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, which Turkey has sought to topple for more than five years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Turkey\u2019s attention is primarily focused on the Kurds and containing the ascent of the Kurdistan Workers party</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now that jihadi groups have expanded their militancy on to Turkish soil, Turkey is becoming the Middle East\u2019s Pakistan.

The group, which has fought the state for political and human rights for Turkey\u2019s Kurds, has risen to international acclaim in recent years for its battlefield success against Isis. In Syria, its sister-group the Democratic Union party (PYD) and its armed wing, the Peoples\u2019 Protection Unit (YPG), have captured numerous Isis strongholds in partnership with US special forces, including the key town of Manbij last week.</p> <p>Isis will continue to focus its attention on Turkey and invest its resources there as it makes losses in Syria and Iraq, but Erdo\u011fan\u2019s energy is heavily invested in securing his authority in Turkey\u2019s post-coup environment. Reconciling with the Kurds and going after Isis within and outside of Turkey will not be his immediate priority, particularly if targeting Isis emboldens the Kurds.</p> <p>Turkey may be unwilling or incapable of uprooting jihadi networks on its soil. But that does not mean Europe and the US cannot attempt to mediate the conflict between the government and the Kurds or, alternatively, pressure Turkey into accepting the emerging political and security framework in the region, of which the Kurds are now a major component.</p>",

There were too few interpreters, social workers and foster families; schools had lacked the capacity to respond and services such as dental care had struggled to meet demand.</p> <p>Shortage of foster care has been the biggest difficulty in Germany: earlier this year, the city of Hannover had to issue an urgent appeal for carers for 180 unaccompanied children, mainly boys aged 13 to 17.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2015/nov/23/refugee-crisis-europe-austria-social-work\">Social workers' response to Europe's refugee crisis a testament to human hope</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The most worrying aspect of this picture is that because of the inadequate and disjointed response by government agencies, children who flee poverty and war are falling prey to traffickers and smugglers.

stare down the deniers and take meaningful action on climate change.</p> <p>He donned the leather jacket and soaked up the love from progressives as he differentiated himself from his successor on same sex marriage, on the use of border protection as a political tool, on three word slogans.</p> <p>When Abbott won the Lodge and confirmed he lacked the nuance to lead, Turnbull found a way to be

  "<p>There were few good things about growing up in the western suburbs of Sydney. In summer, the concrete and bush would soak in the sun and the heat would linger without relief. No sea breeze or calming southerly; just a packed crowd at Parra pools elbowing in line for the diving boards. Entertainment by way of box-walled Westfields dotting the expanses of neighbourhoods like watering holes. RSLs, bowlos, acres of partitioned grassland. Repeat.<br></p> <p>As children, we rode bikes to cover the sprawling pavement, as kids ought to do. As adults, we cruised listlessly as grown adults ought not. For us, kids from western Sydney, our place has always affected our movement. </p> <p>The idea itself \u2013 that people from western Sydney are lesser than those from the eastern and northern suburbs \u2013 is one that has been carefully danced around for as long as I can remember.

The idea that we have of Australia, the one that is depicted on our screens, is not evident in western Sydney. There\u2019s not a beach in sight, and the people look different. As western Sydney local and filmmaker Guido Gonzalez <a href=\"http://www.screen.nsw.gov.au/news/western-sydney-director-guido-gonzalez-calls-for-more-films-depicting-australia-s-diversity?enews=207\">put it</a>: \u201cWhere in our media do you see what you see by walking down a main street in Cabramatta, Liverpool or Parramatta?\u201d </p> <p>James Arvanitakis, sociology professor at Western Sydney University, <a href=\"http://jamesarvanitakis.net/should-a-university-re-brand/\">acknowledged on his blog</a> that the region \u201chas always had to deal with being considered as Sydney\u2019s \u2018other\u2019 \u201d. While this is true of many metropolitan and suburban divides, it seems that in Sydney\u2019s case the divide is written into our narrative. It\u2019s not a gradual fade from terraces to backyards, but a stark line. Our postcode problem has created a class divide so great that it threatens to determine our potential. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our postcode problem has created a class divide so great that it threatens to determine our potential<br></p> </blockquote> <p>Western Sydney is the geographical heart of Sydney and comprises 2.1 million Australians within the confines of its hotly debated geographical lines. (I say \u201chotly debated\u201d because the people who live at the edges of these lines are quick to clarify that they\u2019re not within them. Always be wary of a person who tells you they\u2019re \u201cfrom the north west\u201d.) The region is also the country\u2019s most ethnically diverse, with migrants hailing from 72 countries, and 43% of residents speaking a language other than English at home. </p> <p>But actual facts about western Sydney have always been clouded by its reputation for crime and economic disadvantage. In her <a href=\"http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/journals/index.php/ijcre/article/view/2506\">2012 essay</a> examining how community arts could change perceptions of the city\u2019s west, Christina Ho found: \u201cTraditionally, Sydney\u2019s western suburbs have been associated with all the markers of poverty and disadvantage, and a distinct lack of cultural sophistication \u2026 More recently, as western Sydney has become increasingly multicultural, the stereotypes have focused more on \u2018ethnic crime\u2019 and immigrant \u2018ghettoes\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>To understand the depth of how the region has been portrayed, it\u2019s interesting to look at where that portrayal is coming from.

Places like <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://ice.org.au/\">Information and Cultural Exchange (Ice)</a> and more recently <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://sweatshop.ws/movement/\">Sweatshop: Western Sydney Literacy Movement</a> have worked tirelessly to infuse the region with arts education initiatives. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bankstownpoetryslam.com/home/\">Bankstown Poetry Slam</a>, the largest of its kind in the country, was created by western Sydney students Sara Mansour and Ahmad Al-Rady, who were sick of having to go to the city for every cultural event. And community theatres stretching from Campbelltown to Holroyd put on regular shows to regular crowds. </p> <p>Trying to stop the move of the Powerhouse and Tropfest to Parramatta re-instils this idea that western Sydney doesn\u2019t appreciate culture and, by extension, the people don\u2019t either. And don\u2019t deserve to. </p> <p>In Overland, Peter Polites from the Sweatshop initiative <a href=\"https://overland.org.au/previous-issues/issue-212/debate-peter-polites-stephanie-convery/\">wrote about</a> about western Sydney and the ways in which children are brought up to seek opportunity according to their self worth and their sense of entitlement. Polites recalls his own parents trying to steer him away from the arts field, encouraging him to take up an apprenticeship because he would \u201cgain more economically\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until he attended Sydney College of the Arts that he understood the gravity of the default position he found himself in: \u201cI came to understand that there were systemic gaps between the world in which my family lived and the world in which some of my friends lived.\u201d It\u2019s even reflected in the <a href=\"https://www.parracity.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/115432/Greater_Western_Sydney_summary_statistics_November_2012_FINAL.pdf\">statistics</a>: residents living in the greater west are 10% less likely to have a bachelor degree than those who don\u2019t.</p> <p>When the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/05/sbs-reality-show-struggle-street-betrays-vulnerable-people-says-missionary\">controversial Struggle Street documentary</a> aired mid last year, the ABC <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-06/postcode-discrimination-felt-in-blacktown-mt-druitt/6449214\">spoke to long-time western Sydney residents</a> who have had to fake their postcode on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 just to get a job. There are residents who have admitted to moving suburbs to give their children a chance at a more illustrious future. It\u2019s disheartening to remember that this is all in the same city.</p> <p>I\u2019ve felt this elitism very viscerally. I\u2019ve always felt like a phoney or an outcast at inner-city arts events. Even working in a creative field, I feel the ceiling of potential creep lower whenever I discover yet another successful media professional hailing from the east or north shore. So many times I\u2019ve considered how much easier it would be to stay in my place, within the box that the reputation of my postcode has created for me and others like me. </p> <p>People who hail from Sydney\u2019s west are well honed in self-deprecation. It feels like a talent we\u2019re born with. We\u2019re the first to make a joke about a stabbing in our area or the lack of things to do, but that\u2019s only because we know that at any minute someone else will.</p>",

According to a <a href=\"http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/06/07/euroskepticism-beyond-brexit/\">survey of attitudes in 10 large European countries</a> by the Pew Research Centre, only a third of mid-lifers there (aged 35-49) viewed the EU favourably \u2013 not far behind the over-50s in grumpiness about the institution. Across well-off northern Europe, it is those in mid-career and in their child-rearing years who are most likely to feel lacklustre. In the Netherlands only half of the middle-agers describe themselves as positive about the EU, as opposed to three-fifths of the 18- to 34-year-olds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82d56310fe4b3700c8f9ab3a8bdb1a3bc37b737d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82d56310fe4b3700c8f9ab3a8bdb1a3bc37b737d/0_72_5426_3256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Berliners sit on Berlin Wall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In the 1990s, as a correspondent in Berlin, I watched the rise of the new EU from the rubble of the Berlin Wall.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Germany too has tilted \u2013 not in quite so sulky a direction as France, it is true, but one in which the affinity that both elites and the wider population have for the EU as an ideal looks far more loosely woven than it was.</p> <p>True, there is still a lot of a \u201cWhat on earth have you done?\u2019\u201d in the air after June. Checking into a hotel as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/28/england-iceland-internet-reacts-humiliating-euro-2016-brexit\">England exited Euro 2016 in the aftermath of referendum day</a>, the reception lady said with feeling, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for your week!\u201d The freshly minted team from Downing Street and Brexit ministers find that the first offer of help from Merkel-land is \u201cHow can we help sort this out?\u201d followed by \u201cWhen can you hold another referendum?\u201d.</p> <p>As for Germans, even while they hope, like many Britons, for an acceptable form of \u201cdemi-Brexit\u201d, they no longer brim with the joys of Europe. I remember an exuberant Die Zeit front page about Germany and Europe after unification that read: \u201cThere never was such a new beginning!\u201d That is precisely the sense of possibility today\u2019s Europe lacks. Now there is yet another sign of that widespread demographic divorce between young and middle-aged: three-fifths of young Germans in the Pew research are positive about the EU, but barely a half of those in their late 30s and 40s.</p> <p>If rich Europe is dyspeptic, what about Greece and Spain, the southern \u201cproblem children\u201d? The latter, once fiercely pro-EU, now has just under 50% of mid-lifers onside. Austerity-stricken Greece sees no big difference in the overwhelmingly negative views of the mid-lifers and the over-50s. Italy and Sweden would have to be the holiday destination for the European Movement \u2013 and they are rarities in having relatively good ratings among the middle generation; while Poles and Hungarians are positive about the EU in all age groups (despite an increasingly chauvinistic Hungarian government that has made handling the migrant crisis much harder by erecting its own <a href=\"https://reportuk.org/2016/02/28/the-great-wall-of-europe-hungary-splits-continent-in-two-with-huge-fence-to-stop-migrants/\">Great Wall of Europe)</a>. But the EU cannot base a revival only on poorer countries or new entrants clinging to it, often as respite from erratic governance at home.</p> <p>To draw lessons from the UK referendum requires a cool look at the claims about who voted for what. \u201cYoung people voted to remain by a considerable margin, but were outvoted,\u201d the Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, told the Guardian. Martin Schulz, the German president of the European parliament, feels for \u201cfuture generations\u201d who voted to remain. In fact the results for Britain\u2019s midlife group were one of the bigger problems for remain. Its votes \u2013 just a <a href=\"http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/\">few percentage points over the halfway mark to stay in</a> \u2013 were too scanty a layer of insulation to see off leave.

Sure, this means that planning for hospitals, schools and roads remains 10 years behind the curve, but think of all that money that can instead be used on useful things like drone attacks on Arabs.</p> <h2>Two: Tone down the scrutiny</h2> <p>Secondly, when Australia does stuff up, there is often way too much scrutiny. The way Malcolm Turnbull jumped on the opportunity to establish a royal commission into the Northern Territory\u2019s detention system shows how our politicians have been trained to react with knee-jerk accountability whenever something terrible happens to people who aren\u2019t donors to your party.</p> <p>A better model is to look at how Turnbull is treating calls for a royal commission into banks. Here he understands something that we should apply to everything in Australia: that perception matters more than reality. What we don\u2019t know, can\u2019t make us feel bad about ourselves.</p> <h2>Three: Shift the blame</h2> <p>Thirdly, when something terrible happens, always blame something else. This is something that Donald Trump is masterful at, but with which we struggle. Take for instance: refugee policy. The mortar-board-set keep trying to blame the government for our treatment of people fleeing for their lives. But what about the governments back in their homelands trying to kill them? Nobody ever blames them. It\u2019s like blaming your neighbour for locking their door and not letting you into their house to escape a fleeing axe-murderer, rather than blaming the axe-murderer.</p> <p>The point is, on many issues, from human rights to climate change, Australia shouldn\u2019t be blamed for our bad behaviour when it\u2019s often simply a consequence of the bad behaviour of others.</p> <p>For example, when it comes to the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia should point the finger overseas at the nations burning the coal we\u2019ve exported to them, not at our patriotic coal miners who haven\u2019t burnt a piece of coal in their life.</p> <h2>Four: Watch more renovation shows</h2> <p>Fourth, to make Australia great again, people should watch more renovation shows on television. Programs like Four Corners and Q&amp;A give you an unrealistically grim view of Australia, whereas Renovation Rumble makes you feel good. It\u2019s all about improving Australia \u2013 not critiquing the institutions that run it.</p> <p>According to my research, Four Corners has never once explained how to build a patio out from your dining room area to create both light and space. And it\u2019s been on air for 55 years. What a disgrace.</p> <h2>Five: Build a wall</h2> <p>Finally, if we learn anything from Trump, it\u2019s that Australia needs to build a wall around itself. Obviously, not a real wall. I tried that, but it kept on sinking into the ocean. Instead, it\u2019s about building a metaphorical wall.</p> <p> Instead of listening to the UN agencies who despise our way of treating fellow human beings, and the international climate organisations that point to our emissions as being among the highest per capita in the world, we should stop listening to them, blow up some balloons, have a giant party and celebrate. If we try really hard, we can ignore the fact that we\u2019re part of the rest of the world.</p> <p><em>Charles Firth is the editor-in-chief of The Chaser Quarterly.

  "<p><strong>Sunday 24 July 8.43am.</strong> In the midst of the US presidential election, news breaks that WikiLeaks plans to release 20,000 hacked Democratic Party emails that will likely damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances, and enhance Donald Trump\u2019s. I read the relevant passage aloud to my wife, before adding my own searing commentary: \u201cI would\u2019ve thought Assange and Co would have the intelligence to realise ...\u201d I suddenly pause. </p> <p>A ripple of panic pulses through me. Am I complaining?</p> <p>Over the past five months that question is one that has developed the ability to paralyse me. Why? Because I\u2019m in the throes of what has turned out to be an epic challenge. I am trying to go 21 days without complaining. A self-imposed abstinence from grumbling of any kind: no slander of public figures, no whining about the weather. Nothing.</p> <p>It\u2019s an exercise that I first heard of while listening to a podcast by Tim Ferriss, the productivity expert and quasi self-help guru. Ferriss in turn discovered it after it was popularised by a new age pastor from Kansas City by the name of Will Bowen. And while I identify neither as a member of the self-help set nor the god squad, I was instantly fascinated by the mission.</p> <p>The rules are ostensibly simple: put an elastic band on one wrist. Every time you complain, switch it over to the other wrist. Repeat, until the band has remained on one wrist for three weeks.</p> <p>The simplicity is compelling, but the moment you start it becomes awfully complex. It turns out that \u201cAm I complaining?\u201d can be a very hard question to answer, because what<em> is </em>a complaint? There\u2019s obviously the dictionary definition: an expression of discontent about a person or state of affairs, something like that. But in practise it gets murky. Consider the following three phrases.</p> <ol> <li>\u201cIt\u2019s cold.\u201d</li> <li>\u201cDamn it\u2019s cold.\u201d</li> <li>\u201cDamn this cold.\u201d</li> </ol> <p>I think we could all agree that (1) is probably not a complaint. Assuming the weather is actually cold, it\u2019s just a statement of fact. And we could reach a similar consensus that (3) definitely is a complaint. But what about (2)? What about (1) said in a slightly whiny tone of voice? What if someone else says (3) and you agree with them? </p> <p>Or how about this: \u201cI would\u2019ve thought Assange and Co would have the intelligence to realise that a Trump government will not be good for people like him.\u201d Is that a complaint, a pointed observation, or merely the expression of a dashed expectation? </p> <p>On that particular Sunday morning, I decide it is not a complaint. I turn the page and leave the worn-out hair elastic clinging to my left wrist. </p> <p><strong>Monday 25 July 11.19am.</strong> The following day I meet my wife for coffee. As we approach the cafe, I spot a former colleague waiting at the counter. Let\u2019s call him Gary. I\u2019m not a fan of Gary\u2019s. I mean, I wish him no specific harm. He\u2019s not a bad person \u2013 he just has an awful sense of humour. Dad jokes and cries of \u201cTaxi!\u201d when a glass breaks are the cornerstones of his comedic oeuvre. Now I\u2019ll have to endure some of it and, worse, my sweet wife will be subjected to it. For a moment I forget myself. As I spot The Gazmeister I let out a big sigh and two words slither out after it: \u201c<em>This </em>idiot.\u201d</p> <p>That sentence isn\u2019t even a sentence. It doesn\u2019t have a verb. But the moment I utter it, I know the truth. It\u2019s a complaint. I change the elastic band over and brace myself for some punny pleasantries. It stings, because at that point I was into my fourth consecutive day without complaint. And in five long months of trying, the longest I have gone is six days.</p> <p>Not complaining is really, really hard. Until you try to stop, you\u2019ve no idea how often you do it. It\u2019s not a question of whether you\u2019re an inherently positive person or a negative one. Complaint is a pivotal part of all conversation \u2013 it can be used for good as well as evil. A lot of the time, we complain as a way to connect. A shared moan is a time-honoured technique for relating to a co-worker, fellow traveller or life partner. Who hasn\u2019t felt the warm rush of catharsis that occurs when you discover that someone else hates that thing you hate? Bellyaching is bonding.</p> <p>So it\u2019s wrong to say that complaints are wholly negative. In fact, some can be extremely positive. In a certain light, you could even view the whole of human progress as the result of complaints. Complaints about slow horses, or polio. Complaints about apartheid, or gender inequality.</p> <p>We need complaints, and we need negativity. But for me at least, this challenge is not about disputing that fact. Nor is it about worshipping at the altar of positivity. The reality is you can perform some verbal gymnastics that allow you to express negative sentiments without complaining. \u201cThis traffic sucks\u201d can become \u201cI would love it if this traffic would clear.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/26/five-of-the-best-meditation-apps\">Five of the best meditation apps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in order to do that you\u2019ll need to pause and really think about your choice of words. This is where the challenge becomes fascinating, because you start to realise how little thought we give to what comes out of our gob. The words just tumble out, like goods being looted from a supermarket. By focusing the mind on complaints, you employ someone to work the checkout. And why is that of any benefit? Well, it becomes a sprawling and highly effective exercise in mindfulness.</p> <p>Mindfulness, in case you missed it, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/26/mindfulness-craze-schools-university-near-you-cambridge\">approaching the status of full-blown fad</a> \u2013 pretty impressive for something that is a few millennia old. One description is that it\u2019s the practice of being present in any given moment. If that smells a bit too much like smouldering sandalwood for your liking, try \u201cbeing aware of what you\u2019re doing and what\u2019s happening around you\u201d. </p> <p>Buddhists long ago observed what they call the \u201cmonkey mind\u201d, the idea that the mind is inherently a bit restless and fidgety. If you don\u2019t give it a clear task, it will either keep a running commentary, or wander off on tangents. Your head becomes filled with an endless, meandering chatter \u2013 a din that has been blamed for everything from anxiety to insomnia. The solution, say the Buddhists, is to give the monkey a job. It could be watching your breath come and go (meditation), or it could be keeping a keen eye on what you\u2019re doing (mindfulness).</p> <p>The claimed benefits are as varied as they are numerous: improved focus, anger management, treatment of depression, lower blood pressure, stress relief, general wellbeing. It\u2019s a laundry list of advantages that has seen mindfulness teachings adopted by everyone from captains of industry to captains of football teams. All sorts are trying to experience the benefits of silencing their simian. There are countless ways to do it, but I\u2019ve found one of the best ways to shut him up is to have him monitor your moaning.</p> <p><strong>27 July.</strong> Mid-morning a colleague and I travel to a meeting in his 2006 Toyota, a vehicle he calls Sonia Kluger, after the Australian media personality. I ask him how he feels now that his people mover has become associated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/18/tv-host-sonia-kruger-calls-for-end-to-muslim-migration-to-australia\">calls to ban Muslim immigration</a>. He says there\u2019s not much he can do about it. But our conversation has taken a turn, and we make some very pointed observations about Isis and the state of the world. I come dangerously close to complaining, but stop just short.</p> <p>It\u2019s not until later that evening that things fall apart. Over dinner a family member tells us she\u2019s recently discovered that her former boss underpaid her entitlements. The business is no longer trading, so she\u2019s unlikely to see the money owed. I simply can\u2019t participate in the conversation without making negative comments about the person in question. It occurs to me that if I have any chance of making it to 21 days, I\u2019ll need to recognise these situations immediately, and turn mute.</p> <p>It\u2019s that recognition that is the hard part though. That\u2019s what makes it so different from other abstinences. When someone breaks their commitment to Dry July, they do so consciously. I\u2019d imagine very few people get halfway through a beer and suddenly remember that they\u2019re meant to be off the sauce. But that is exactly how it is with complaints. By the time you realise a gripe is in the vicinity, it\u2019s usually too late.</p> <p><strong>5 August. </strong>Seven days and counting, a new record. I call the bank about two errors it has made, and manage to correct both without complaining. Instead, I simply state that I \u201ccan\u2019t understand\u201d why these things occurred when I was led to believe they would not occur. Sure I sound like a robot, but who cares? I\u2019ve completed a task with a high degree of difficulty. If not complaining were figure skating, the bank call would be equivalent to a triple axel. I might not have shown much grace through the air, but I stuck the landing. </p> <p><strong>12 August. </strong>It\u2019s at this point that I could veer off on a tangent about the general level of whingeing in the world. I could note that social media has amplified gripes about everything from overpriced avocados to sluggish Wi-Fi. I could write about how millennials are profuse whingers, surpassed only by non-millennials when you get them on to the topic of those wretched millennials. I could do all that, but I won\u2019t. That would be a meta-whinge, and I\u2019m 14 days without complaint. I\u2019m into the home stretch and I\u2019m not about to slip up now.</p> <p><strong>19 August. </strong>I took on whining, and I won. Were there some 50/50 calls that went in my favour? You bet there were. But when it\u2019s all said (or weirdly bottled up) and done, I achieved my objective. Thrust into all manner of less-than-stellar scenarios, I summoned the strength to stifle my disapproval. I came, I saw, I concurred. Not only that, I did it at a time when the Pok\u00e9mon GO frenzy was at its peak.</p> <p>So how do I feel? Well, unsurprisingly, there\u2019s not some powerful benefit that is unlocked on the 21st day. Rather there is an accumulation. I definitely think my focus has improved, along with general calmness. But perhaps the most noticeable benefit is a greater sense of control. You might think your level of control is just fine as it is \u2013 I certainly did \u2013 but it can be much better. If you try to stop complaining you\u2019ll see what I mean. </p> <p>Turning off autopilot is hard to do, and you\u2019ll find those muscles that steer the plane have atrophied. But if you pump them up for a few weeks, the flight becomes more interesting and engaging. </p> <p>How do I feel? Can\u2019t complain.</p>",

And unlike a lot of women, conservative and otherwise, she\u2019s been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/watch/conway-all-issues-are-women-s-issues-746954819988\">recently telling MSNBC</a> \u201cI think you should judge people by their actions, not just their words on a political campaign trail\u201d. Whether Trump will be able to listen to and learn from Conway\u2019s guidance, however, remains to be seen.</p> <p>Listening to women has never exactly been Trump\u2019s strong suit, but now his entire campaign may hang in the balance of his ability \u2013 or more likely, lack of ability \u2013 to do just that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/kellyanne-conway-is-donald-trumps-last-chance-winning\">Kellyanne Conway is Donald Trump's last, best chance | Lucia Graves</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bb672ce4b0377cf11192aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-22T20:57:30.736Z\">9.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>The Clinton campaign is really pushing this new campaign advert:</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/767827749063057409\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In times of crisis, America depends on steady leadership, clear thinking, and calm judgment. <a href=\"https://t.co/Tpo3Sp7Ri1\">https://t.co/Tpo3Sp7Ri1</a></p>&mdash; Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/767827749063057409\">August 22, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bb608ce4b0b7e6490021a8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-22T20:35:28.093Z\">9.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Donald Trump postpones immigration speech</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump\u2019s highly anticipated speech on immigration, originally set to take place on Thursday in Denver, Colorado, has been postponed.</p> <p>A Trump campaign spokesperson <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2016/08/22/donald-trump-immigration-plan-aspen-colorado/\">told the Denver Post</a> that although the candidate will be appearing in at a big-dollar fundraiser in Aspen, Colorado, the trip will not be accompanied by a much-ballyhooed policy address on Trump\u2019s signature issue: immigration.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.univision.com/univision-news/politics/trump-now-says-he-plans-to-legalize-some-undocumented-immigrants\">Rumors flourished this weekend</a> that Trump had softened his stance on deporting the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the US, including openness to creating a pathway to legal status, after a meeting with Latino leaders in which Trump reportedly admitted that deporting millions of US residents \u201cis neither possible nor humane\u201d.</p> <p>In an interview with Fox &amp; Friends this morning, a defiant Trump dismissed the reports, but did not come out and say that he would, as he\u2019s previously suggested, implement a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to hunt down undocumented immigrants living in the United States,</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not flip-flopping,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe want to come up with a really fair, but firm answer.

I am committed to visiting communities affected by these floods, at a time when the presence of a political campaign will not disrupt the response, to discuss how we can and will rebuild together.</p> <p>\u201cIn times of crisis, Americans have always come together to lift each other up, support each other, and rebuild stronger and better than before. That is what we must do now in Louisiana, and I am committed to standing with Louisianans every step of the way.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f6555c9458d3aa66d18d003eb4d9051b1f62d10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f6555c9458d3aa66d18d003eb4d9051b1f62d10/0_0_3500_2450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump sign on flood dross in St. Amant, Louisiana, U.S., August 21, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump sign on flood dross in St. Amant, Louisiana, U.S., August 21, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Bachman/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bae06be4b0b7e649001f62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-22T12:58:15.626Z\">1.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello, and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. Former secretary of state Colin Powell has accused the Hillary Clinton cabal of trying to \u201cpin\u201d her email scandal on him, after the revelation last week that Clinton brought up Powell in discussing the issue with the FBI. </p> <p>\u201cHer people have been trying to pin it on me,\u201d Powell <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/colin-powell-hillary-clinton-pinning-email-scandal-on-him\">told</a> People magazine at a fundraiser for the Apollo theater in East Hampton, New York, on Saturday night. \u201cThe truth is, she was using [the private email server] for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did.\u201d</p> <p>Powell told NBC News <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/clinton-told-fbi-colin-powell-recommended-private-email-sources-n634136\">last week</a> he sent a memo to Clinton \u201cdescribing his use of his personal AOL email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department\u201d. The New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/us/politics/hillary-clinton-told-fbi-colin-powell-advised-her-to-use-private-email.html?_r=1\">reported</a> last Thursday that Clinton told the FBI that Powell had \u201cadvised her to use a personal email account\u201d. The report was based on a leak by Congress of notes from a classified interview. </p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d Powell, 79, told People. \u201cBut it\u2019s OK; I\u2019m free.\u201d </p> <p>It doesn\u2019t bother Powell. Will it bother voters? </p> <h2>Big Clinton ad buy</h2> <p>The Clinton campaign has reserved $80m in air time in eight competitive states for the fall, bringing their total spending on TV ads to $150m, the Associated Press <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/urn:publicid:ap.org:6c8cf18968e6478d907eda2cdab1e0db\">reports</a>. Donald Trump only began airing ads in recent days and has reserved just $5m worth.</p> <p>A new ad the Clinton camp will air is called Just One, as in: \u201cAll it takes is one wrong move.
