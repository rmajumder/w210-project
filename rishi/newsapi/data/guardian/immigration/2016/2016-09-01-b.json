The asylum seeker was eventually escorted off the plane by police and returned to detention in Melbourne.</p> <p>Pilbrow was charged under the Civil Aviation Act for interference with a crew member of an aircraft and faces up to two years\u2019 imprisonment. The asylum seeker has since been deported back to Sri Lanka, according to Kumar Sinna, a Tamil community advocate and friend of Pilbrow\u2019s.</p> <p>Sinna said Pilbrow would plead not guilty on Friday. She will be supported in the Broadmeadows magistrates court by human rights advocates and representatives from the Tamil community, who will gather in a nearby park before the court case in a public display of support.</p> <p>\u201cShe is a little bit nervous but she still believes she stood up for justice and compassion,\u201d Sinna told Guardian Australia. </p> <p>\u201cThe Tamil community certainly believes it is a brave thing that she did and that she fought for justice. She has been heavily involved with the Tamil community and in helping asylum seekers in the past few years, so we really wish to support her.\u201d</p> <p>Last month the Dandenong Journal <a href=\"http://dandenong.starcommunity.com.au/journal/2016-08-05/nowhere-to-run-to-2/\">reported that</a> about 20 Tamil asylum seekers living in the Greater Dandenong-Casey region of Victoria had been detained in recent weeks by Australian Border Force staff who raided their homes in the middle of the night.</p> <p>Sinna and other human rights advocates say that, despite a change in the Sri Lankan government last year, it remained unsafe for Tamils, who they say are still being detained. <a href=\"http://hrlc.org.au/joint-statement-with-human-rights-watch-and-amnesty-international-calling-on-australia-to-stop-forced-returns-without-proper-screening/\">Human rights organisations</a> have consistently raised concerns about Tamil asylum seekers being persecuted and tortured upon their return to Sri Lanka.</p> <p>\u201cThey are still facing abuse and disappearing,\u201d Sinna said. \u201cLeaving the country to seek asylum is illegal and those returned are dealt with by Sri Lanka\u2019s criminal investigation department, notorious for the rape and torture of Tamil men, women and children.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/29/abbotts-sri-lanka-comments-excuse-war-crimes-tamil-refugee-advocates-say\">Abbott's Sri Lanka comments 'excuse war crimes', Tamil refugee advocates say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last month Australia\u2019s immigration minister, Peter Dutton, announced that the government had returned a group of Sri Lankan nationals to Sri Lanka after intercepting a boat with six asylum seekers on board.</p> <p>\u201cOur Sri Lankan partners provided advice that this vessel might be targeting Australia so we were ready and waiting to locate and detain the boat,\u201d Dutton said at the time.</p> <p>\u201cWe have worked cooperatively with Sri Lanka for several years now and, since Operation Sovereign Borders began in 2013, every Sri Lankan boat that has attempted to come to Australia illegally has failed. </p> <p>\u201cThis return shows that there has not been, and will not be, any change to Australia\u2019s robust border protection policies.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The home secretary has been urged to take immediate action over the 387 refugee children in Calais who have a right to come to Britain.</p> <p>The list of eligible children who are stuck in the camps in Calais has been drawn up by Citizens UK and given to Amber Rudd, and the demand for immediate action endorsed by Alf Dubs \u2013 the Labour peer and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/04/britain-failing-child-refugees-europe-help-them-fast\">long-time refugee campaigner</a>.</p> <p>It comes as a group of more than 100 faith leaders, council chiefs and celebrities, including Juliet Stevenson and Vanessa Redgrave, prepare to gather outside the Home Office on Friday at a memorial event marking the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/04/alan-kurdi-turkish-court-jails-pair-syrian-toddler-death-trafficking\">anniversary of the death of Alan Kurdi</a>, the three-year-old Syrian boy whose body was washed up on a beach in Turkey.</p> <p>The plea for urgent action on child refugees in Calais also comes as a freedom of information request has revealed that the government spent more than \u00a3100,000 earlier this year in legal fees to make it harder to reunite refugees in Calais with their families in Britain.</p> <p>The list of 387 refugee children eligible to come to Britain is made up of the names of 178 children who have a right to come to the UK because of their close family links in the country and a further 209 children who qualify under the terms of the \u201cDubs\u201d amendment accepted by the government in March earlier this year.</p> <p>Lord Dubs said: \u201cI am deeply saddened that despite repeated calls from me and others the government still seems to be dragging its feet on the commitments made when the amendment in my name was accepted.</p> <p>\u201cNow that the new government has had some weeks to settle in after the EU referendum vote there really is no excuse for any further delay. Theresa May and Amber Rudd should be taking immediate action.\u201d</p> <p>Citizens UK says that to date the only children transferred from France to Britain have been those with family in the UK, largely involving those supported by its Safe Passage partnership: \u201cThis process takes months and at the present rate it will take over a year to help the 178 children identified,\u201d said a Citizens UK statement. \u201cTo date not one child has been transferred from France to Britain under the wider provisions of the Dubs amendment.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said that more than 30 under-18s have been accepted for transfer within Europe since the Immigration Act 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/27/peer-condemns-shocking-delays-over-help-for-unaccompanied-child-refugees\">which includes the Dubs amendment</a>, reached the statute book in May and the majority had already arrived.

Last year there were over 3,000 claims for asylum in the UK by unaccompanied children, in addition to those who were already being cared for in the UK,\u201d said the Home Office spokesperson. \u201cWhile these children have made it to the UK, they still need support and we still need local authorities to agree to care for them.\u201d</p> <p>They added that they were in talks with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, other partner organisations and the Italian, Greek and French governments to speed up mechanisms to identify, assess and transfer unaccompanied refugee children to Britain.</p> <p>\u201cWe continue to work closely with the French government to ensure that children in Calais with family links in the UK are identified, receive sufficient support and can access the Dublin family reunification process without delay,\u201d he added.</p> <p>But actor and campaigner Stevenson said the government had not shown the generosity to refugees it should. She said: \u201cOn this painful anniversary, when we remember a tiny Syrian boy lying drowned on a Turkish beach, a death which shook the world, it would be appropriate for the prime minister and home secretary to act to help stranded refugee children. We are only talking about fewer than 400 children. How can it be argued that Britain cannot cope in providing new homes for these children?\u201d</p> <p>Bishop Peter Hill, the Bishop of Barking, who visited Calais last week, added: \u201cI appeal to ministers to look into their hearts and take immediate action to bring these children to safety. It has been established that the UK has a legal obligation to these children, but more to the point, this country has a moral obligation.\u201d</p> <p>The government legal department\u2019s FoI response showed that more than \u00a365,000 was spent on barristers\u2019 fees and a further \u00a339,000 on \u201cinternal costs\u201d in successfully challenging an<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/02/uk-home-office-wins-appeal-against-ruling-four-syrian-refugees-calais-camp\"> immigration tribunal ruling</a> earlier this year that three Syrian teenagers and a 26-year-old man should immediately be brought to Britain and reunited with their families.</p> <p>But the information commissioner has had to step in and demand that the Home Office responds within 35 days to an FoI request asking for details of how many refugees have been transferred to the UK under the Dublin arrangements for family reunion in the past 12 months.</p> <p>Labour MPs will also press the home secretary on Monday for faster progress on child refugees and are expected to publish further legislation that would try to secure the removal of the children from the Calais camps before Christmas.</p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair has claimed Britain could remain in the European Union, despite the referendum result in favour of Brexit, if public opinion shifts in the next few years.</p> <p>The former prime minister told a French radio station that people had the right to change their minds on the result of the June referendum, and said the debate would continue throughout the UK\u2019s exit negotiations. </p> <p>Theresa May has repeatedly insisted that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, stressing her determination to respect the result of the referendum by taking the UK out of the EU.</p> <p>But Blair, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/18/politicians-eu-membership-blair-clegg-brexit-referendum\">wanted the UK to stay in the EU</a> and as Labour prime minister argued for joining the euro, said remain supporters should continue to warn voters about the costs and consequences of Brexit.</p> <p>Speaking to the <a href=\"http://www.europe1.fr/international/brexit-pour-tony-blair-le-debat-continue-et-un-maintien-dans-lue-reste-possible-2834899\">French radio station Europe 1</a>, Blair said it was probable that the UK would leave the EU but possible it could stay in.</p> <p>Negative economic consequences such as a fall in the value of sterling, damage to the financial services industry, weaker car manufacturing or a reduction in foreign investment in the UK could shift the debate, he suggested.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment, today, it is not probable, but the debate continues and I believe it is possible,\u201d Blair said, adding that there was no reason why remain supporters should simply accept the result of the referendum, in which 52% of people voted to leave and 48% wanted to stay in.</p> <p>\u201cWho made a rule that we have to stop the debate now?\u201d he said. Asked whether the campaign to stay in the EU could continue and British people could still change their minds, he said: \u201cWe have the right.\u201d</p> <p>Blair said the prime minister, Theresa May, had to stick to her position that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/22/brexit-means-brexit-when-is-big-question\">\u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d</a> in order to preserve the unity of the Conservative party, but added: \u201cFor the rest of us, we are free to have a debate.\u201d </p> <p>He also pointed out that it was difficult to know what Brexit actually meant before the terms of leaving had been negotiated with the other member states.</p> <p>\u201cWe have done something rather bizarre with Brexit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like moving house without having seen the new house. We have made an agreement to exchange, but we don\u2019t yet know the terms of Brexit, we don\u2019t know the costs and the consequences.\u201d </p> <p>He added: \u201cThere will come a moment when we have had the negotiations and we can see the terms we are being offered by the rest of Europe and we will be able to say that it is a good idea or perhaps that it is a bad idea with major consequences.\u201d</p> <p>It comes as the official remain campaign, Britain Stronger in Europe, relaunches itself on Friday as a new group to fightfor a Brexit deal under which the country remains open to trade and talent.</p> <p>Open Britain has published a detailed paper on what it believes May should be pushing for during the Brexit negotiations, arguing that the starting point should be an \u201cambitious\u201d demand to stay in the single market.</p> <p>The group says the prime minister ought to push for economic protections, including tariff-free trade, alongside a bid to \u201cmend not end\u201d free movement. It claims that policies such as a migration impact fund and banning agencies from advertising solely overseas could be introduced.</p> <p>And it suggests a Europe-wide discussion about the issue with all countries examining tying free movement of labour to offers of employment.</p> <p>The Conservative MP Anna Soubry, a key backer of the campaign, said: \u201cThe campaign will marry a commitment to Britain\u2019s membership of the single market with making a positive case about the benefits of immigration. The present system needs further reform. It\u2019s particularly important people know the facts about immigration, we tackle their concerns and ensure the system works fairly for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Pat McFadden, a Labour MP, said the electorate backed Brexit but there were still big, open questions about Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU to be answered.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Such terms are unlikely to be acceptable to the pro-Brexit campaigners who pushed hard for the UK to leave and want a more comprehensive exit with a complete end to free movement between other EU countries and Britain. Downing Street has said it wants a bespoke deal for Britain and recognises the need to restrict immigration, but May has not set out exactly what she wants from a deal to leave the EU.</p> <p>Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative chair of the House of Commons treasury committee, put pressure on the government to start explaining its position on Friday in a paper for Open Europe. He called for the government to distance itself from the leave campaign, particularly the promises about budget savings, and a trade deal that gives the UK not just access to the single market but influence over services regulation. He said this means neither World Trade Organisation rules nor membership of the European Economic Area would work.</p> <p>He also said triggering article 50, starting the process of leaving the EU, should not be rushed, and the government should, if necessary, be willing to wait until after French and German elections next year.</p> <p>David Davis, the Brexit secretary, gave an indication of how he would like a new deal for Britain to work as he spoke in Northern Ireland on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we will seek to do is ideally to have a tariff-free access, but this is a matter of negotiation, and we will be negotiating over an issue which I suspect we will find is in the interest of the other members of the EU as well as us, to get a good trading relationship in the long run,\u201d he said.</p>",

And Mexico will pay for the wall ... They don\u2019t know it yet, but they\u2019re gonna pay for the wall.\u201d This, after Pe\u00f1a Nieto had tweeted that he\u2019d told Trump from the beginning of their conversation his country wouldn\u2019t be paying under any circumstances.</p> <p>Speaking on NBC\u2019s Today show on Thursday morning, Hillary Clinton\u2019s veep pick Tim Kaine knocked Trump\u2019s performance as \u201camateur\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/first-read-trump-makes-support-mass-deportation-clear-n641256\">saying</a>: \u201cYou can\u2019t say different things to different audiences.\u201d It\u2019s an interesting knock coming from Kaine, who\u2019s known for speaking differently to different audiences, sometimes speaking in English, other times in his dad-like Spanish. </p> <p>A fundamental difference: Kaine changes how he talks but not the substance of what he promises.</p> <p>Tweaking how you talk depending on the audience \u2013 code switching \u2013 is actually the sign of a good listener, an <a href=\"http://ologists-claim.html/\">empathetic human being</a> and, very often, a skilled politician. But it can be difficult for politicians to walk the line between authenticity and connecting with different populations. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton has been teased for affecting a drawl while speaking to black audiences, and Michael Steele has been mocked for saying things like \u201coff the hook\u201d. Even Obama, a guy Zadie Smith has praised <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22334\">for his mastery</a> of the cultural pivot, gets criticized for it sometimes. After a speech before a mostly black audience in 2007 in which he took on a preacherly tone of voice, for instance, Fox News personality Tucker Carlson pointed to it as evidence of pandering. \u201cThis accent is absurd,\u201d he concluded in a segment on Sean Hannity. \u201cThis is a put-on.\u201d</p> <p>It can also be done well, though. Bill Clinton was known as the first black president in part because he knew how to affect a southern twang. George W Bush was beloved by voters in no small part for being likably folksy \u2013 <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnist/benedetto/2004-09-17-benedetto_x.htm\">the guy voters wanted to have a beer with</a> \u2013 if not respected. As African American writer Eric Deggans <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/04/10/176234171/learning-how-to-code-switch-humbling-but-necessary\">put it</a> in a 2013 column for NPR, code switching is an important way to make sure you\u2019re understood across cultures.</p> <p>It can go wrong when it veers into the territory of pandering, as when Marco Rubio was accused of saying something more pro-immigration on Spanish language TV than he was saying elsewhere. Specifically he was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arTUEdwCw7s\">accused</a> by Ted Cruz of supporting President Obama\u2019s program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, to allow some young people to remain in the US by giving temporary legal status to immigrants who came to the states illegally as children. Politifact <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/feb/17/ted-cruz/did-marco-rubio-say-spanish-univision-he-would-not/\">found the claim</a> half-true on the grounds that Cruz didn\u2019t include the full context of the discussion, but it still didn\u2019t play well for Rubio.</p> <p>The sometimes blurry line between form and substance switching are on display now, when we look at the differences between how Trump changes his speeches to reach different audiences, and how Kaine does.<br></p> <p>Trump can be a highly skilled code-switcher in ways that are valuable to him as a politician. It\u2019s what allowed him to read the Republican base better than anyone in the party establishment and construct a campaign that would resonate. But in altering the substance of what he says depending on audience, he takes the tactic too far. </p> <p>With Kaine we don\u2019t have to worry about any such thing. On the contrary, it\u2019s respectful to learn another culture\u2019s language in the melting pot America is increasingly becoming. The way Trump alters his message isn\u2019t code switching, per se. It\u2019s not \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d, and it certainly isn\u2019t respectful to his audience. It\u2019s just more lying.</p>",

  "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/simone-biles\" title=\"\">Simone Biles</a> won four gold medals in Rio last month, she was the latest in a line of charismatic female gymnasts whose Olympic acrobatics have captured imaginations far beyond the world of sport. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2011/dec/14/50-olympic-moments-nadia-comaneci\" title=\"\">Nadia Com\u0103neci</a> (in 1976) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jul/06/50-stunning-olympic-moments-olga-korbut\" title=\"\">Olga Korbut</a> (1972) are two famous examples. But V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1, who has died aged 74, was the first and the bravest.</p> <p>\u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1\u2019s seven Olympic golds, won in Tokyo in 1964 and Mexico City in 1968, included back-to-back golds as best all-round gymnast, an achievement matched only once in Olympic history. The second of these was won by a points margin unparalleled until Biles\u2019s 2016 triumph \u2013 and marked the culmination of a four-year period in which \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 won 19 individual gold medals at major international championships. She remains the only gymnast, male or female, to have won Olympic gold in every individual event. But what made her a global celebrity was not the number of her triumphs, but her character.</p> <p>The third daughter of a grocer from the Karl\u00edn district of Prague, \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 showed early athletic promise but initially tried to channel her talents into ballet and figure skating. At 14, she was taken under the wing of Eva Bos\u00e1kov\u00e1, the leading female gymnast in what was then Czechoslovakia. Within four months she was competing internationally. By 1958, aged 16, she was good enough to be taken to the world championships in Moscow; the team won a silver medal.</p> <p>In 1960 she was part of the Czech team that won silver in the Rome Olympics. But it was in Tokyo four years later that she established herself as the greatest gymnast of her generation \u2013 notwithstanding a fall from the asymmetric bars. Her three gold medals (vault, balance beam and all-round) and team silver barely began to reflect her dominance.</p> <p>Look at the 1964 footage today, and it all seems absurdly simple, compared with the gravity-defying aerobatics of Biles. At the time, it was unprecedented. \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 took a discipline that had been largely dance-based and injected it with athleticism and daring. \u201cIt has to be seen to believed,\u201d reported the Times. She was muscular: her US rival Kathy Corrigan described her as \u201cbuilt like a spark-plug\u201d. Yet she competed with grace and charm as well, winning hearts as freely as medals.</p> <p>The latter continued to accumulate, including all-round titles in both world (1966) and European (1965 and 1967) championships. Then came 1968: the high point and turning point of her life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"79f0fa314031b14e92b3aec35455223f8d4a4f58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79f0fa314031b14e92b3aec35455223f8d4a4f58/339_85_1686_2108/800.jpg\" alt=\"V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 in gym practice, Czechoslovakia, 1964.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 in gym practice, Czechoslovakia, 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ZUMA P/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the year began, two decades of hardline communist tyranny in Czechoslovakia were giving way to an unprecedented experiment in \u201csocialism with a human face\u201d. Alexander Dub\u010dek, who coined that phrase, became first secretary of the Communist party. Censorship was abolished, political prisoners were rehabilitated; there was talk of a \u201cPrague spring\u201d. The Soviet Union complained furiously that the reforms were \u201cthreatening the foundations of socialism\u201d. In June, the author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk published a provocative manifesto, known as The Two Thousand Words, urging the reformers to hold firm in the face of Kremlin intimidation. \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 was among the public figures who signed it (as were the nation\u2019s other great Olympic idols, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/nov/23/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Emil</a> and Dana Z\u00e1topek).</p> <p>It did not help. On 20 August 1968, a huge Soviet-led Warsaw Pact army <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/aug/21/1968theyearofrevolt.russia\" title=\"\">invaded Czechoslovakia</a>. Widespread passive resistance caught the world\u2019s imagination; the tanks, inevitably, triumphed. Dub\u010dek\u2019s experiment was dead.</p> <p>\u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1, fearing arrest, retreated to a remote forest hideout in the Jesen\u00edk mountains, where, for the final weeks of her training for the Mexico City Olympics, she swung from branches, lifted sacks of potatoes and practised her beam exercise on a log. At night, she shovelled coal to prevent her hands from becoming soft.</p> <p>It seemed to work. Given last-minute clearance to travel to Mexico, she went to the Olympics \u201cdetermined to sweat blood to defeat the invaders\u2019 representatives\u201d. This furious resolve was sublimated into a series of routines of breathtaking energy and panache. Spectators found her irresistible; her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYqG7IG4b4U\" title=\"\">floor routine</a>, to Mexican \u201chat dance\u201d music, was a particular hit. But the trauma of recent events could not be banished.</p> <p>A controversial judging decision cost her gold in the beam; an even more controversial revision of scores saw her forced to share the gold for the floor routine. In each case, the beneficiary was a Soviet. On the medals podium, \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 twice made her displeasure plain, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dykBBhaoczg\" title=\"\">looking pointedly downwards and away while the Soviet anthem was played</a>. The gestures would cost her dear.</p> <p>She ended the Olympics with four golds and two silvers, and rounded things off with a celebrity-packed wedding in Mexico Cathedral to her team-mate, Josef Odlo\u017eil, the 1500 metres runner.

Her compatriots voted her sportsperson of the year. But the tide of events was against her.</p> <p>The following spring, Dub\u010dek was ousted. Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k, who replaced him, began a programme of \u201cnormalisation\u201d in which all dissent was purged from Czechoslovakian life. \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 was prevented from travelling abroad or participating in public events at home \u2013 in effect, she was forced into sporting retirement. After resisting pressure to withdraw her signature from The Two Thousand Words, she was also barred from coaching. She worked for a while as a cleaner, but regularly presented herself to Anton\u00edn Himl, chairman of the national sports federation, to declare herself available for coaching work.</p> <p>Her fame gave her some leverage. In 1972, the Czechoslovak government bowed to international pressure and allowed her to travel to the Munich Olympics. When West German footage showed her among the celebrity spectators, the Czech TV commentator ignored her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c08b4092c1267159489a146dd0cdf717c855b70f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c08b4092c1267159489a146dd0cdf717c855b70f/0_176_2500_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 in Prague, 2012.

From 1974 \u2013 after presenting herself to Himl dressed in a leotard \u2013 she was allowed to coach children, discreetly, at the Sparta Prague sports club. From 1975 she was allowed to advise coaches to the national team. Eventually, she was permitted to spend time abroad, coaching in Mexico from 1979 to 1981. After that, the sports federation gave her an obscure desk job in Prague, sharing an office with the similarly disgraced Emil Z\u00e1topek.</p> <p>The Velvet Revolution of 1989 brought a new president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/18/vaclav-havel\" title=\"\">V\u00e1clav Havel</a>, to power. He signalled \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1\u2019s rehabilitation by making her an official adviser. She also became chair of the national Olympic committee and from 1995 to 2001 was a member of the IOC.</p> <p>By then she was divorced; she and Odlo\u017eil had parted in 1987. But her family troubles were not over. In 1993, Odlo\u017eil got into a fight with their teenage son, Martin, in a night club in Doma\u0161ov, and died shortly afterwards of his injuries. Martin was jailed \u2013 Havel pardoned him, controversially, in 1997 \u2013 and \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 fell into a deep depression.</p> <p>For many years she was barely seen except by her closest friends and family. But she remained revered by her compatriots, and in recent years she had seemed to be regaining her appetite for life. By 2012 she was describing her new-found energy as \u201cmiraculous\u201d and had recovered enough joie de vivre to delight a Mexican crowd, as a guest at a gymnastics event in Acapulco, by demonstrating spontaneously that at 70 she could still do the splits.</p> <p>She ended her life with an embarrassment of honours, including the Olympic Order, the Pierre de Coubertin Fair Play prize and the Czech Order of Merit; but she wore her past glories lightly. One friend, the publisher Tom\u00e1\u0161 Dimter, was surprised to find no trace of her achievements when he first visited her house. \u201cWhen I asked her where all her medals were, she just waved her hand and pointed to a wooden shed in her garden. There were hundreds of medals and trophies, secured with a simple latch.\u201d</p> <p>She remained a woman of stubborn principle, speaking out on behalf of refugees. \u201cShe was a lifelong fighter,\u201d said her friend Karel Engel, a former Olympic wrestler. \u201cShe never reconciled herself with injustice.\u201d</p> <p>She is survived by Martin and by her daughter, Radka.</p> <p>\u2022 V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1, gymnast, born 3 May 1942; died 30 August 2016</p>",

  "<p>Hannah James is best known on the British folk scene as a member of <a href=\"http://www.ladymaisery.com/hannah-james/\">Lady Maisery</a> and for her earlier work with Kerfuffle, but she\u2019s also a soloist and an <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://jigdoll.co.uk/\">inventive one-woman band</a>. Her live shows mix vocals and accordion with elaborate foot percussion created as she dances on specially designed platforms, while building up layers of sound by using loop pedals. And as this debut solo album proves, the results can be unexpectedly subtle and delicate. The opening First Lullaby is a gently hypnotic affair that starts with a low hum and builds up via overdubbed vocals. Elsewhere, accordion and foot percussion are mixed with her cool, intimate vocals on Woodsman, her reworking of a broadside ballad; and Treasures is a thoughtful song about attitudes to the refugee crisis.

  "<p>Friday will be Theresa May\u2019s 50th day in office. Forty-nine days ago, the Women\u2019s Equality party set our new prime minister a challenge: our 65,000 members and supporters \u2013 left and right, blue and red \u2013 want her to commit to six achievable policies so that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can become the first countries in the world where all genders are equal.</p> <p>Those goals \u2013 affordable childcare; sustainable funding for services working to end violence against women and girls; compulsory sex and relationships education (SRE); ratifying the Istanbul convention; ending the detention of asylum seekers; and equal representation of women in parliament \u2013 would change the lives of women and men across the UK. They would mean better politics, a more vibrant economy, a workforce that draws on the talents of the whole population and a society at ease with itself.</p> <p>On Wednesday night the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn committed in principle \u2013 though not yet in detail \u2013 to the affordable childcare challenge we set him, while pledging his support for mandatory SRE in every school and a 50:50 parliament. In the coming 50 days the Women\u2019s Equality party will continue to push Theresa May to match these commitments and to put women\u2019s equality where it belongs, at the top of the agenda.

  "<p>Dame Margaret Anstee, who has died aged 90, was one of the most colourful figures in the history of the United Nations, proving over and over again that a woman can succeed in a man\u2019s world without sacrificing her principles or her sense of humour. She had a whole string of firsts to her name, of which the most often cited perhaps does her least justice, because it is the most bureaucratic: she was the first female staff member to reach the rank of undersecretary general, which she did in 1987 when she became head of the UN\u2019s \u201cthird headquarters\u201d, its office in Vienna.</p> <p>She is still remembered in that city with great affection, but her most spectacular exploits occurred in far more dangerous and exotic places. First hired as a local staff member in Manila in 1952, she went on to serve in several countries in Latin America, and also in Ethiopia, Morocco and finally Angola \u2013 where, as head of an understaffed and underfunded UN peacekeeping mission, she oversaw the 1992 elections and tried desperately, but in the end unsuccessfully, to prevent the country sliding back into civil war.</p> <p>In between, she held important posts in Geneva and New York, as well as Vienna, struggling to introduce greater coherence and rationality into the UN\u2019s rambling technical assistance machinery, but always happier when working in the field to help the world\u2019s poorest peoples and those experiencing the greatest suffering.</p> <p>Her competence and calmness under fire (both literal and metaphorical), her willingness to live, work and travel in the most uncomfortable circumstances and her ability to make friends wherever she went were grudgingly but increasingly recognised by her superiors. Successive UN secretaries general turned to her for the most arduous troubleshooting missions.</p> <p>Earlier she had had a brief career in the Foreign Office; in 1955 she was shortlisted to succeed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/03/lord-healey\">Denis Healey</a> as international secretary of the Labour party; and in 1967-68 she served as deputy (and briefly successor) to Thomas Balogh when he headed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/may/25/obituaries\">Harold Wilson</a>\u2019s personal thinktank in No 10.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35a4411de9ab4911424f2f0a30121c8d3fc8d131\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35a4411de9ab4911424f2f0a30121c8d3fc8d131/426_435_2696_1618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Anstee with President Fidel Castro of Cuba at a United Nations crime congress in 1990.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Anstee with President Fidel Castro of Cuba at a United Nations crime congress in 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UN Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anstee was born in the village of Writtle, near Chelmsford, Essex, where her father, Edward, worked for a local printer. Her mother, Annie (nee Mills), had been in domestic service in Herefordshire before she married. Both parents, having had to leave school at 14 and 12 respectively, \u201cdeeply resented the lack of further education\u201d, she wrote, and \u201cdetermined to have only one child, and to ensure it the best education they could manage\u201d.</p> <p>They succeeded. Despite a series of illnesses, and the conviction of the village school headmistress \u201cthat country children were not as intelligent as our town counterparts, and that those of us who had the misfortune to be female were even less so\u201d, Margaret progressed to Chelmsford county high school for girls and eventually, after learning Spanish in three months at the age of 17 in defiance of the school authorities, to read modern and medieval languages at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she got a first, and also displayed the social and technical skills that were to stand her in good stead in her future career. Invited to an Oxford ball, in the days of postwar clothes rationing, she kitted herself out in a dress \u201cmade from a surplus military parachute of white nylon, then a totally new fabric\u201d.</p> <p>After a year lecturing in Spanish at Queen\u2019s University Belfast, she joined the Foreign Office, which had just been opened to women, in 1948. To her delight, Anstee was assigned to the South American department, only to find \u201cthat it was Foreign Office policy never to send a woman diplomat to Latin America, for fear she would succumb to the wiles of \u2018some passionate Latino\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>A similar logic (or lack of it) required women diplomats to resign if they got married. Anstee\u2019s brief and unhappy marriage to a Foreign Office colleague thus brought her own career as a British diplomat to a premature end, but also accidentally launched her UN career, since she found herself in the Philippines with time on her hands, and needing money to pay her fare home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d9d107fdc2871700345505cba6d90753ff2a0c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d9d107fdc2871700345505cba6d90753ff2a0c6/0_60_2580_1548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Anstee shows her book Never Learn to Type (2003) to the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Anstee shows her book Never Learn to Type (2003) to the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UN Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This led eventually to a series of postings as UN representative \u2013 in Colombia (1956-57), Uruguay and Argentina (1957-59), Bolivia (1960-65), Ethiopia (1965-67), Morocco (1969-72) and, most traumatically, Chile (1972-74), where she witnessed the coup against Salvador Allende. Many people she had worked with were killed or tortured, and she found herself engaged in a desperate battle to rescue members of her own staff, as well as foreigners who had taken refuge in Chile from authoritarian regimes elsewhere.</p> <p>In all these countries she became a trusted adviser to the government on economic policy, devising and implementing many development projects; she was also a shrewd observer of the foibles and eccentricities both of local officials and of her UN colleagues and bosses.

Alas, like so many UN reform plans before and since, its implementation was largely blocked by a coalition of vested interests in the secretariat and in national governments.</p> <p>Anstee retired in 1993, and was made a dame the following year. In retirement she divided her time between her beloved Bolivia, where she built herself a house on the shore of Lake Titicaca, and her mother\u2019s home county, Herefordshire, where she shared a beautiful house and garden on the Welsh border with her aunt Christina, who died in 2000.</p> <p>Both her personality and her achievement are well expressed in the title Anstee chose for her highly entertaining autobiography, Never Learn to Type (2003), which should be required reading for all new recruits to the UN, irrespective of gender or nationality. Throughout her life she rebuffed attempts (of which there were many) to confine her to roles considered appropriate and \u201csafe\u201d for a woman to undertake. She knew she had far more to offer than that, and no glass ceiling could long hold her down.</p> <p>\u2022 Margaret Joan Anstee, diplomat, born 25 June 1926; died 25 August 2016</p>",

In a world where even the most ardently future-facing artists are eventually pinned down and pigeonholed, she\u2019s spent much of the last decade bulldozing her way through fads and phases, sidestepping the new boring, upstaging the queen of pop and \u2013 somehow, throughout it all \u2013 sustaining sonic relevance.</p> <p>Even in a year in which our most prominent artists are exploring their creative limits \u2013 Frank Ocean\u2019s week-long carpentry live stream; <a href=\"http://insider.foxnews.com/2016/08/29/beyonce-mtv-video-music-awards-performance-gun-violence-police-shootings\">Beyonce\u2019s interpretation of the atrocities of gun crime</a> aired on primetime TV \u2013 the Sri Lankan rapper\u2019s originality remains unmatched. Yet there is something absent on AIM, an album she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/15/mia-aim-last-album\">recently claimed</a> would be her last. Sure, there is vision, scope and experimentation \u2013 there\u2019s even an inexplicable cameo from the world\u2019s most famous former boy band member \u2013 but for the most part, AIM is frustratingly unfocused.</p> <p>It\u2019s disheartening, not least because the initial signs around her fifth album were so promising. The hypnotic teaser song Swords (which features on the deluxe version of AIM) is sparse and slick, fusing samples of clanging metal and arriving with a triumphant video starring a group of sword-wielding female dancers. Then came her official return with Borders \u2013 released at the tail end of 2015, it exhibited MIA\u2019s ability to scale a pop culture framework while providing serious political messages. A stark, brutalist construction, it infused eastern and western sounds, and pit basic, benign web-speak (\u201cbeing bae\u201d, \u201cbreaking the internet\u201d, \u201cqween\u201d) against sincere statements of compassion. The video was similarly affecting: a cinematic depiction of the refugee crisis that featured a cast of men scaling barbed wire fences and lying lifelessly on a flotilla of boats laden with bodies.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-Nw7HbaeWY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r-Nw7HbaeWY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-Nw7HbaeWY\">Borders by MIA on YouTube</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Given that Richard Ashcroft appears to be the only other mainstream artist to have recognised the migrant crisis <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21894-these-people/\">in song</a> this year, the visibility of MIA \u2013 a refugee who escaped the Sri Lankan civil war \u2013 seemed vital in 2016.

Joyousness is something MIA has imbued in many of her hits, from the braggadocious Bucky Done Gun to the glamorous world-beat of Bad Girls.

The same fleeting pleasure can be felt on Bird Song, a lumbering list of winged animals set to a kazoo-like caw. On Jump, as MIA\u2019s vocals stutter and overlap rather than creating the rhythmic soundscape she may have intended, it pushes the limits of the listener\u2019s patience. Freedun, which features the subtle, syrupy vocals of former One Direction member<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/02/lessons-from-adele-justin-bieber-and-zayn-on-having-a-hit-number-one-no-1\"> Zayn Malik</a>, is a better example of her buoyant capabilities; it bubbles and crunches, a cartoonish creation that elevates the middle section of the album, even if Malik and Maya appear to be channelling different spirits.</p> <p>Her mellifluous excursions work best. \u201cWhat haters say about me don\u2019t worry me, I keep it moving forward to what\u2019s ahead of me,\u201d she raps on Finally, a breezy dalliance with dancehall. Its approachability does not exist on the majority of AIM. These are global-facing pop songs that somehow have no place: too slow for a club, too confrontational for the bedroom, too skatty for the radio. It sounds as if AIM was made exclusively for MIA\u2019s benefit: one final eruption of inventive and sometimes incoherent ideas. Apt, perhaps, that an artist so vehemently punk bows out with an album so stubbornly hers.</p>",
  "<h2>Yours sincerely, wasting away</h2> <p>What is Stage 2? A new development of luxury apartments built on the site of the Washington Plant and ideal for a young family? The level you access only after you\u2019ve beaten the big bad of E Corp in hand-to-hand combat? A situation that only occurs once a disease has truly suppressed the immune system?</p> <p>Whatever it is, Stage 2 is Elliot\u2019s idea. We know this because he hacked the phone of Xun, a Dark Army lieutenant, who told us as much. Darlene was monitoring the calls, and so became the first to know. This puts her in a sticky position, not just because her brother might be working in the interests of the Chinese government, but also because she beat her lover up with a baseball bat thinking it was he who knew all about Stage 2.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbae6558a04a95facc93bf80aea7543131e7be54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbae6558a04a95facc93bf80aea7543131e7be54/59_0_1212_727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elliot\u2019s Dissociative Identity Disorder has got to the point where nothing makes sense any more.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elliot\u2019s Dissociative Identity Disorder has got to the point where nothing makes sense any more.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: USA Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elliot, for his part, would seem unlikely to be as surprised as his sister by the news. Not because he remembers what Stage 2 is \u2013 he does not \u2013 but because his Dissociative Identity Disorder has deteriorated to the point where very little makes sense any more. This week, Elliot has three out-of-body experiences, where he watches himself \u2013 as Mr Robot \u2013 from a distance. Also, and just as unusually, he actually shouts at someone (Xun, when he meets him in person). As Elliot consciously tries to take on more qualities of Mr Robot \u2013 assertiveness, determination \u2013 \u201cElliot\u201d is being subconsciously pushed to one side. And yet \u2026 his encounter with his mother, where he asserted himself upon a mute party, suggested a non-chaotic alternative for our hero. He used an idea of his mother to keep himself sane in prison. Maybe he will gird himself again in battles to come.</p> <p>[As a sidenote, I enjoyed the introductory sequence of Elliot\u2019s prison compadres in their actual environment.

Elliot in the prison yard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: USA Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Several plot twists this week. We know why Elliot went to prison (that darned dog!). We know that Mrs Wellick has worked out who Elliot is. Dom DiPierro, meanwhile, could turn out to be Angela\u2019s best ally, while there\u2019s something going on in Sharon Knowles\u2019s apartment. But for all the plotting, the psychology of the characters remains the most compelling aspect of this excellent drama.</p> <p>Elliot\u2019s may be the most complex, but watching Phillip Price at work is always gripping. The CEO of Evil Corp is the greatest villain in Mr Robot, mainly because we don\u2019t know the depths to which he is prepared to sink. This week he faces off against Whiterose, his main rival in perfidy. Rose, who is both queen hacker and Chinese minister of state, reveals that she killed the last CEO of Evil Corp (and then, for effect, actually pisses on his grave). Such behaviour doesn\u2019t cut much ice with Price. \u201cI\u2019m a mercenary,\u201d he informs Whiterose. \u201cI do what I want. Order will not protect you any more, I will rain chaos, even if it hurts me. Because I would rather see you lose than win myself.\u201d That\u2019s some baddie talk right there.</p> <p>It\u2019s a standoff. Price needs a bailout to refloat Evil Corp, while Whiterose can\u2019t afford for the Washington Plant to close. Price asks Whiterose to get the Chinese government to step in, which may be humiliating for him. That said, his position is not as sticky as his opponent, who may threaten all he likes but can\u2019t afford to see Evil Corp go bust.</p> <p>Unless I\u2019ve missed a vital scene (it has been known), we have no idea what the pair\u2019s ultimate motives are. Price, after all, appears to be complicit in the hack that brought his company low in the first place. What Whiterose wants with all that leaky nuclear material is unclear too (though maybe one could have a guess at something military). I suspect we will learn more next week.</p> <h2>Indicate precisely what you mean to say</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b862b9c5bab5f9340c1dde2b0f9a1961994d486\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b862b9c5bab5f9340c1dde2b0f9a1961994d486/171_0_1148_689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A quick learner on e-sabotage \u2026 Angela.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A quick learner of e-sabotage \u2026 Angela.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: USA Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Angela turns out to have been a quick learner when it comes to electronic sabotage.

Surely if there\u2019s one thing she\u2019s learned from her time inside a massive conspiracy, it\u2019s that it\u2019s best to trust no one. Anyway, she may have to trust again after Dom played her hand. She knows a lot of what Angela has been up to, and suspects the rest, but she knows not to trust her superiors after the Chinese shootout and so might be able to offer Angela the kind of arrangement she needs.

If immigration is her red line, Theresa May shouldn\u2019t pretend she can get \u201ca positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services.\u201d Almost everything everyone says about Brexit is, as it has always been, unlikely to be true.

In disruptive French and German elections expect grandstanding Sarkozy-type revenge attacks on us.

Placating Brexit maniacs, such the Brexit press already shouting \u201cbetrayal!\u201d while playing the double bluff of foreign trade deals means fooling a lot of people a lot of the time.

The best that can be hoped for is retaining access to the Single Market with concessions on immigration (an emergency brake of sorts, even though I\u2019m pro-immigration, I believe this is non-negotiable). This will avoid having to negotiate endless trade deals or uplift many EU Regulations into UK law. Any alternative will mean years of complex, fraught negotiations with countries uninterested in giving us a good deal, while our labour market collapses from the loss of EU workers (NHS will be worst hit) and we bicker over our stagnating economy. It\u2019ll be like this for 10-15 years. </p> <p>What do I think will happen? Arguments, lobbying, and disappointment all round. We can\u2019t retain access to the Single Market without free movement of labour. We can\u2019t hope to avoid a shock to the economy without it. We (apparently) voted for Brexit to \u2018solve\u2019 immigration (no mention of outside-EU workers, already under a points system, funnily enough) so that\u2019s also a non-negotiable. So there will be an impasse, likely ploughed through by civil servants and a Tory government being lobbied from all angles. I expect concessions for the city or the Square Mile will be hit hard - and however much we want its influence to ebb, it\u2019s 20% of our GDP and a huge tax slice - and immigration to be central, so we\u2019ll be having to negotiate costly trade deals that aren\u2019t Canada plus, or Norway-lite, or anything. And these negotiations will be going on after May\u2019s long gone.

Every time I look to research into a new bit of British life to see what the implications are, my mind starts to boggle. Take passports, for example. It seems like bringing back a navy blue passport will be a PR win for Theresa May, would please a lot of Leave voters, and be a real symbol of \u201ctaking back control\u201d. </p> <p>So, first of all you\u2019ve got to make sure that the rest of the EU and the rest of the world will continue to accept UK passports issued with the European Union design and name on them after the actual day of Brexit. I can\u2019t imagine they would be refused, but you\u2019d probably need to explicitly clarify they would still be valid. There will be people whose passports expire a few days before the date of Brexit who will need to renew them for travel in that period, so you also have to decide whether you are going to continue issuing passports in the EU design that expire in 10 years, or whether you gradually taper this down. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1535ff5da670b414cb0e002f91849508866e8dbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1535ff5da670b414cb0e002f91849508866e8dbe/0_117_3588_2152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passports: a sticking point?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passports: a sticking point?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niklas Halle'N/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you\u2019ve got 10 year EU-style passports being issued that means you have to commit to all the equipment at our borders still being able to read the data on those passports for at least a decade. That probably means whatever you do about the new passport design, the chips etc have got to be compatible with the existing equipment. So even though we\u2019ve taken back control, we\u2019d still have to adhere to the EU data standard. You can anticipate that there will be a rush of people wanting to replace their passports early, so before you start issuing them you need to have stockpiled enough of the new design and make sure there isn\u2019t going to be a huge overwhelming backlog of applications. </p> <p>None of this is insurmountable, it is quite clearly possible to switch from one set of passport designs to a different set on a specific day, because we did it in reverse. But, what you\u2019ve got to do is synchronise this change with all the other changes you are making. And you\u2019ve got to find the civil service and ministerial time for it, with a civil service that has been reduced in size over the last six years. Possibly it would require some legislation which might take up a bit of parliamentary time. And it is the least of your worries, but you probably also have to remember to change all the signs at every single border crossing. And changing passports is just ONE element in the whole of Brexit. It\u2019s all achievable, but I genuinely expect to be reporting on the process of Brexit for the next five years.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T12:16:36.266Z\">at 1.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c81578e4b06b4ac1748929\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/james-walsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T12:13:46.381Z\">1.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We\u2019ve been hearing from Remain voters frustrated at what they see as the incoherence of the Leave campaigners, and their inability to decide what Brexit means - and the implications that this will have for the Brexit negotiations.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt seems inevitable that it will be driven by political manoeuvring rather than the national interest,\u201d says David Ward, and NHS Manager in Norfolk.</p> <p> \u201cWhatever shores up the PM\u2019s position within the party and wins votes will be the favoured option.

The newer members will not easily surrender on freedom of movement. The older ones, with Eurosceptic parties challenging hard on immigration in elections next year, simply cannot afford to give Britain a \u201chave your cake and eat it\u201d deal.</p> <p>If there is one clear message to have come from every European capital in the past two months, it is that single market membership comes at a price, and part of that price is accepting freedom of movement.

There can be no cherry-picking, as several leaders have said.</p> <p>So this will be a difficult circle for the prime minister to square, particularly since Britain does not start from a particularly strong negotiating position: if the UK-EU trade relationship were to revert to standard WTO terms, both the European and the British economies would be damaged \u2013 but Britain\u2019s would, undeniably, take the relatively bigger hit. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c80b11e4b09a68e9b64bfa\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/james-walsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T11:06:06.588Z\">12.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">How to contribute</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Want to join our debate but lacking in a Guardian commenting account?

Away sides pressing hard and playing for a clean sheet, Australia huffing and puffing but requiring patience before they can blow the house down.</p> <p>Postecoglou\u2019s surprise selections were justified with Tomi Juric scoring and assisting, and Mark Milligan complementing Trent Sainsbury in defence. <br></p> <p>Attention now turns to Wednesday night and the second group match away to the UAE. Incredibly the UAE head into the fixture off the back of defeating Japan 2-1 in Saitama. Also, in case you were wondering, it\u2019s 42 degrees in Abu Dhabi right now, so expect a few changes to tonight\u2019s starting XI. </p> <p>Anyhow, thanks for your company tonight, always nice to start a qualifying campaign off with a win.

As Alvin and the Chipmunks sang, it\u2019s been a while but we\u2019re back in style. Well, maybe not in style, but back nonetheless, for Australia\u2019s first match in the final group phase for qualification to the 2018 World Cup in Russia.</p> <p>We\u2019re at the romantically named Perth Rectangular Stadium (aka the equally evocative nib Stadium) for Australia vs Iraq. Kick off is 8.30pm Eastern, and it\u2019s not on free to air TV, so put the kids to bed, and settle in for a relaxing night of questioning FFA\u2019s strategic planning. </p> <p>This is technically the third round of qualification for the Asian Football Confederation with Australia cruising through the second stage at the top of Group B. The Socceroos are now one of just 12 remaining teams from Asia in the mix with only the top two from two groups of six guaranteed a place in Russia. The two third placed teams face a play-off against each other, before a play-off against the fourth best team from the CONCACAF region. This is an ultramarathon, not a sprint. </p> <p>In Australia\u2019s group of six, in rank order, are Japan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, and Thailand. It\u2019s worthy of a \u2018Group of Death\u2019 cliche if you\u2019re so inclined, but such is the growing depth of Asian football, there was never going to be a group of easybeats. </p> <p>Although it\u2019s easy to be fearful of a group like this, I think it plays into Ange Postecoglou\u2019s hands. Rather than the big boys cashing in against minnows and worrying about a dark horse or two nabbing third, every match should be competitive for every team. The likelihood is this will mean every team drops points along the journey, giving Australia, with its greater pedigree, a stronger chance of securing one of the top two spots. We\u2019ll see...</p> <p>Home advantage will be important, making tonight\u2019s contest more significant than it may appear on paper.

  "<p>The Home Office is quietly trialling a fast-track online system to handle an expected surge in permanent residency applications from EU migrants in the UK concerned about their British immigration status in the run-up to Brexit.</p> <p>The Home Office has confirmed that it is testing the system, which simplifies the current process that includes completing, printing out and posting by special delivery an 85-page form, ahead of a public launch later this year.</p> <p>The 3.5 million EU nationals currently living in Britain do not need to apply for a \u00a365 residence card to prove their right to live and work in Britain, and there are only about 25,500 applications a year mainly from non-EU spouses or children of an EU national in Britain.</p> <p>But the continuing uncertainty of the legal status of EU citizens in Britain after Brexit means that there is now likely to be a huge increase in demand for residence applications from those who anticipate restrictions being placed on their freedom of movement within Europe.</p> <p>The Oxford University-based Migration Observatory has said that depending on the progress of the Brexit negotiations there may also be a need to quickly register all EU citizens already living in the UK. </p> <p>Migration Observatory\u2019s director, Madeleine Sumption, has estimated that the complexities of the existing paper-based system means it could take 140 years to register all 3.5 million EU citizens in Britain at current rates of processing if they all apply.</p> <p>The Financial Times quotes one person helping to operate the two-week trial, who said the trial was also \u201cpart of a stocktaking exercise\u201d to assess the numbers of EU nationals living and working in Britain.</p> <p>Jurga McClusky, head of immigration at law firm Deloitte, told the FT: \u201cIf we have EU workers with [secure residence] status there could be provisions within government policy to protect them in the long term, meaning that free movement laws will continue to influence UK immigration policy for a period of time post-Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>McClusky added that questions, however, may arise over the status of EU nationals who were not able to register and had difficulty proving their residency in Britain before a cut-off date because they were, for example, students or self-employed.</p> <p>A government spokesman said: \u201cAs part of the ongoing Home Office programme to digitise applications, we have launched a number of online options. We are currently testing an online service which simplifies the process by allowing some EEA nationals to submit electronic applications.\u201d</p> <p>The move was disclosed as the Polish deputy prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said during a visit to London that he expected many Poles to return to Poland after Britain leaves the EU.</p> <p>\u201cI believe there will be many people coming back \u2013 a couple of hundreds of thousands may come back over the next five years,\u201d he told the BBC, adding that the killing of Arkadiusz J\u00f3\u017awik in Harlow on Saturday would \u201cpose a question mark for many families in Great Britain.\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>It\u2019s easy to pigeonhole herbs. Rosemary goes with lamb, sage goes with pork, dill with salmon, basil with tomatoes. While, yes, they do go with those things \u2013 and wonderfully \u2013 they also make for loads of other, less expected, combinations to thrill the tastebuds.</p> <p>A few years ago, I made a simple salad with crisp apples and lots of soft, fresh tarragon, dressing the whole lot with peppery olive oil, lemon juice, and salt and black pepper. I\u2019d never paired apples with tarragon and was astounded by their delicate harmony. It made me think a little more about how I use herbs in my cooking and I began to tinker with combinations I hadn\u2019t explored before. I would serve roast ham with lovage sauce and raw oysters with sweet cicely. I\u2019d barbecue fish on fennel branches until everything caught fire. I\u2019d infuse custards with bay leaves or lavender for ice-creams and creme brulees.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/25/spaghetti-with-tomato-and-fried-chicken-recipe-gill-meller-cook-residency\">Two recipes to make the most of this season\u2019s fresh tomatoes | Cook residency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I grow a few perennial herbs in the garden \u2013 sage, rosemary and thyme are three favourites that I put to work a lot. Herbs elevate fruit, defining and giving it a different expression. Sage goes with almost anything. This summer I\u2019ve been putting it with peaches cooked on a barbecue with black pepper and olive oil. These I served with fresh goat\u2019s curd and, on another occasion, charred squid. Sage\u2019s earthy, bitter perfume works amazingly with the sweet fruit.</p> <p>Today, we have three recipes for fruit with herbs, all hovering between sweet and savoury most satisfyingly. Pears and pork are happy partners in crime, and their latest double act in my kitchen is a warming autumnal roast bridged by rosemary, that strong, resinous and elegant herb, which binds the pears to the bacon magically. For me this is pretty much an all in one supper. You could embellish it, perhaps, with some crumbled blue cheese or tumble through some bitter chicory leaves, but it doesn\u2019t need much.</p> <p>Sage and apples is not an entirely unheard-of pairing \u2013 who doesn\u2019t love sagey apple sauce alongside roast pork? Here, the combination manifests itself as a pudding. Baked apples with lemon, sugar (so far, so traditional), and generous handfuls of sage stuffed in too, adding a flavour that almost haunts the fruit and all the sweet, buttery cooking juices.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had a bit of a wild obsession with thyme since I started cooking at River Cottage many years ago. The garden was always full of different varieties, which I would pick in the morning before beginning work in the kitchen. I used this woody perfumed plant in almost everything I cooked, and I\u2019m sure it nearly always improved it.</p> <p>Just like the other herbs I\u2019ve mentioned, thyme is so good with fruit. I like to add it to a simmering pan of blackcurrants when I make a cordial. Although it\u2019s subtle when you drink a glass, the thyme\u2019s notes are unmistakable. It grounds the dizzy sugar of the raspberries and late summer sweetness of blackberries. I use it with lemon and orange when baking, with fresh figs and honey when I\u2019m grazing, or with dried fruit such as dates, prunes or apricots. And, today, with stewed blueberries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd28849f7d238c37adce1c40a40aa77afec2f52a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd28849f7d238c37adce1c40a40aa77afec2f52a/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pears with bacon and rosemary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Pears and pork are happy partners in crime, and rosemary binds the pears to the bacon magically.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Pears with bacon and rosemary</strong></h2> <p><strong>Serves 4 \u2013 6</strong><br>4-6 medium ripe pears, quartered and cored<br>300g large smoked or unsmoked bacon lardons<br>A small handful of rosemary sprigs<br>4 tbsp olive oil<br>1 tbsp runny honey<br>Salt and black pepper</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6.

  "<p>The Clinton campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/27/hillary-clinton-necono-republican-endorsements-donald-trump-policy-issues\">has now spent months</a> trying to convince relatively obscure former Republican officials to endorse her campaign while also adopting many Republican slogans and arguments in her quest for the presidency. </p> <p>One has to wonder how much long term damage she is doing to progressive policies by deploying this strategy, even if she beats Donald Trump along the way. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/hillary-clinton-derides-donald-trump-mexico-trip-american-legion\">gave a speech in Ohio</a> on Wednesday with yet another former Bush official, James Clad. The speech was billed as touting \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d, one of the more repellent nationalistic concepts that Republicans have used to shame progressives in the past. She <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/clinton-stress-american-exceptionalism-ohio-41764569\">spoke mostly about foreign policy</a>, a subject in which Clinton \u2013 with her penchant for supporting foreign wars and beefed up US military presence everywhere \u2013 seemingly has more in common with mainstream Republicans than the Obama administration.</p> <p>Last week, Clinton again handed legitimacy to the Republican party through the way she has decided to attack Trump. She gave a speech in which she praised prior GOP candidates for their treatment of Muslim Americans, including <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/cd_hooks/status/768934791622209536\">George W Bush</a>, in an attempt to rhetorically separate Trump from these other supposedly upstanding Republicans. In the process, she is kneecapping Democratic candidates around the country who are attempting to retake the House and Senate. </p> <p>Instead of hanging Trump around all Republicans\u2019 necks, she is cleaving him off from other GOP candidates and giving them an easy out, despite the fact that Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/29/donald-trump-monster-gop-polls\">is a direct product of the GOP\u2019s pandering</a> to classist and racist elements of society for a decade. (Leaked Democratic National Committee emails show that at least some <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/293428-leaked-emails-show-dem-split-on-linking-trump-to-gop\">Democrats were worried</a> about this exact scenario.)</p> <p>Whether Clinton\u2019s strategy of trying to peel off a small percentage of Republicans to win the presidency will actually work remains to be seen. There seems to be scant evidence in the polls that a significant amount of Republicans will support her; Clinton\u2019s advantage mostly stems from the fact that black and Hispanic Americans understandably oppose Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/13/new-polls-in-pennsylvania-and-ohio-show-donald-trump-with-0-percent-of-the-black-vote/\">in historic numbers</a>. But if the strategy hinders Democrats from retaking Congress, the damage is going to be seen for years.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just the outreach and compliments to normally detestable Republicans that are the problem. Clinton and the Democratic leadership are latching onto abhorrent concepts and arguments that Republicans have been deploying for decades.</p> <p>Take House Democrats, for example, who on Tuesday <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/08/31/congressional-dems-call-on-fbi-to-investigate-their-political-adversaries-kremlin-ties/\">called on the FBI to investigate</a> the Trump campaign for its alleged ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin. What a great idea! It\u2019s not like calling for a law enforcement investigation into your political enemies for nebulous connections to the Kremlin <a href=\"http://www.coldwar.org/articles/50s/senatorjosephmccarthy.asp\">has ever backfired before</a>. </p> <p>And then there\u2019s the Clinton campaign\u2019s response to questions about large donations to the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments that seem to coincide with the <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/08/25/why-did-the-saudi-regime-and-other-gulf-tyrannies-donate-millions-to-the-clinton-foundation/\">state department approving large weapons deals</a> to dictatorships like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. The Clinton camp has <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/08/25/why-did-the-saudi-regime-and-other-gulf-tyrannies-donate-millions-to-the-clinton-foundation/\">essentially been arguing</a> that since there\u2019s no evidence of quid pro quo, there\u2019s nothing wrong. Many commentators (including <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/25/12615340/hillary-clinton-foundation\">a lot of ethics experts</a>) have said that this comes very close to corruption, and it sounds an awful lot like the GOP\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/768788364514435077\">long-held defense of Citizens United</a>.</p> <p>This is the same logic, too, that the Clinton camp used against Bernie Sanders when he continually pointed out the large number of bank and oil lobbyists who were giving money to the network of Clinton Super Pacs and interest groups during the primary. As campaign finance expert Lawrence Lessig <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-clintons-citizens-united-and-21st-century-corruption/2015/05/08/7f11a0d6-f57b-11e4-b2f3-af5479e6bbdd_story.html?utm_term=.a2896f9ab837\">has previously pointed out</a>, this tactic is further entrenching big corporate money into our political system, even though Democrats have spent years pointing to the dissent in Citizens United that made clear the fundamental problem with corporate money in politics <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/715918806800080896\">is much broader than explicitly buying a vote</a> on a specific issue. </p> <p>Clinton may think that a shift toward the right is her best way to defeat Trump. But given that it\u2019s likely Trump will go down in flames anyway, it should be a cause of concern to all candidates who are attempting to defeat other Republicans along the way.</p>",

  "<h2>Can the Steelers stay healthy enough to mount a Super Bowl run? </h2> <p>Seven points. That was the margin by which Pittsburgh lost to eventual Super Bowl champ Denver in last season\u2019s divisional playoff round. The Steelers led for most of the game and even into the fourth quarter. Not bad for a team that had been deprived by injury of both the league\u2019s best running back, Le\u2019Veon Bell, and wide receiver, Antonio Brown. (Oh, and Bell\u2019s back-up, DeAngelo Williams, as well.)</p> <p>The Steelers had navigated such absences all season. Bell, after a two-game suspension, played in just six games before going down with a torn MCL. Ben Roethlisberger missed five starts at quarterback with knee and foot injuries. His time on the sidelines, allied to poor performances from Pittsburgh\u2019s initial replacement, Mike Vick, cost Brown a very real shot at the NFL\u2019s first-ever 2,000-yard receiving season.</p> <p>Bell is banned again for the first three games of 2016. The Steelers\u2019 No2 receiver, Martavis Bryant, has been suspended for the whole year \u2013 a deeply frustrating situation, after he had emerged as a deadly deep threat during his second season. Tight end Heath Miller retired in February, depriving Roethlisberger of another trusted target.</p> <p>Pittsburgh can survive all of this. If Roethlisberger, Brown and \u2013 after his suspension \u2013 Bell all stay healthy then this should be the most explosive offense in the whole league. A team that has already scored 30+ points on 14 separate occasions over the last two seasons has more than enough firepower to make up for a so-so defense, where coaches hope to see improvement from former first-round picks Jarvis Jones and Bud Dupree.</p> <p>But in a division as fearsome as the AFC North, that \u2018if\u2019 cannot be ignored. </p> <h2>Will Marvin Lewis figure out how to win a playoff game? </h2> <p>Jeremy Hill was not yet born when Cincinnati last won a postseason game. Andy Dalton was barely three years old. And yet you could believe head coach Marvin Lewis when he told reporters last January that this sorry history did not weigh on his players\u2019 minds. \u201cYou look around and there\u2019s 20 new guys [on the roster] from one year ago, and 40 from two years ago,\u201d he observed. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a \u2018here we go again\u2019 feeling.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis though, was ignoring the elephant in the room. There has been at least one consistent presence in the Bengals\u2019 locker room for 13 years now, a man whose prominent role in the team\u2019s 0-7 playoff record in that span cannot be ignored. Him. </p> <p>Lewis is undoubtedly an excellent football coach. He took a team that had not posted a winning season in more than a decade, and turned it into one that has reached the playoffs in six of the past seven seasons, winning the AFC North three times. Going purely on regular season results, this has been the greatest era in Bengals history. </p> <p>They should make the postseason again this season. The Bengals boast a depth of talent that few others can match. Dalton is no longer the boom-or-bust passer who was destined to disappoint you in prime time, but a reliably excellent decision maker. His receiving corps has taken a hit, but he still has AJ Green, a versatile backfield and a superb offensive line. The defense is solid despite already having lost several rookie additions to injury. </p> <p>A playoff berth should be a minimum expectation. The Bengals\u2019 capacity to go further will rely on their coach\u2019s ability to learn, at last, from his mistakes. </p> <h2>How will the Ravens blend old and new?</h2> <p>If the Steelers were hit hard by injury in 2015, then they still did not have things quite as bad as their old rivals from Baltimore. The Ravens lost no fewer than eight week one starters to season-ending injuries over the course of the year, including Joe Flacco, Justin Forsett, Steve Smith Sr and Terrell Suggs.</p> <p>All of these players are now back, but can they still be counted on to deliver at a level that will make the Ravens a contender? Smith, for all his competitive fury, turned 37 in May. Forsett is a 30-year-old tailback who has only once rushed for more than 650 yards in a season. </p> <p>The hope is that others will step forward and take on some of the burden. Rookie running back Kenneth Dixon was a great value in the fourth round and had run well in preseason but will now miss at least the next month with a torn MCL. Kamar Aiken is developing nicely at wide receiver and the addition of Mike Wallace in free agency gives Flacco another option, but does this group still lack a genuine No1 target?</p> <p>On the other side of the ball, can we expect Suggs, now 33 and recently recovered from tearing his second Achilles tendon, to retain that same explosiveness of the edge? Fellow pass rusher Elvis Dumervil is only one year younger, and coming off foot surgery of his own.<br></p> <p>Even before last season, the Ravens had looked like a team in need of some measure of renewal. It might not be time to abandon the old guard completely, but last season\u2019s spate of injuries did bring home the need for better depth. With improved health this year, and contributions from the likes of Dixon, fellow running back Terrance West and rookie pass rusher Matt Judon, the Ravens could get back in the wild card mix, but more than that will likely be beyond them.</p> <h2>Is Hue Jackson the right man to revive Robert Griffin III\u2019s career?</h2> <p>Nobody expects the Browns to be competitive in Hue Jackson\u2019s first year as head coach. The personnel moves orchestrated by Sashi Brown and Paul DePodesta this offseason have very clearly indicated their focus on a longer-term project. Ahead of final cuts, Cleveland has 21 rookies on its roster, including 14 acquired through the draft, and will have 13 picks in 2017, too. </p> <p>The Browns are starting from scratch. Johnny Manziel is gone, but so too are productive veterans such as linebacker Karlos Dansby, wide receiver Travis Benjamin and Pro Bowl center Alex Mack. Pass rusher Paul Kruger, who had 11 sacks in 2014 but just 2.5 last year, was released as the team trimmed down to 75 players ahead of its final preseason game.</p> <p>Amidst so much subtraction, eyes have turned towards the Browns\u2019 one eye-catching free agent addition. Robert Griffin III has not played in a regular season NFL game since 2014, and his performances when he did step onto the field that year were erratic. But he was once the NFL\u2019s offensive rookie of the year \u2013 a genuine dual threat with jet heels and a cannon for an arm. Even now, he still boasts a solid 90.6 career passer rating.</p> <p>Will he ever be as good again as he was in that brilliant first season? Probably not. Injuries have discouraged Griffin from running the ball so frequently, and his critics would argue that he is a one-trick pony in the passing game \u2013 his eye-catching deep ball not enough to make up for poor decision-making overall. It has not escaped anybody\u2019s attention that 215 of his 282 preseason passing yards came on just five passes.</p> <p>Jackson is a smart offensive coach who helped Joe Flacco to achieve rapid success in Baltimore after the quarterback was drafted in 2008, and whose schemes allowed Andy Dalton to find consistency at last in Cincinnati last year. In abstract, he and Griffin look like a good fit. But how much energy will the head coach be able to devote to aiding his quarterback, in what is sure to be a challenging year?</p>",

It had already won the vote in the senate and then tested a number of times. It remains unclear at the tactics employed but essentially a number of Coalition MPs were caught outside the chamber - indeed outside the house. In the end, they were saved by the Speaker\u2019s vote which stopped the substantive motion but allowed further debate. This allowed time for Coalition MPs to find their way back to parliament/chamber and prevail. The motion will come on again in the next sitting week, being September 12.<br></strong></li> <li><strong>Labor\u2019s Lisa Singh won a senate motion calling on the government to reveal any investigations to follow up abuse allegations contained in the Nauru files, leaked in the Guardian.<br></strong></li> <li><strong>The Coalition also unveiled new policies to allow Australian Defence Forces to target terrorist support operations overseas - in line with international law.<br></strong></li> <li><strong>Labor senator Patrick Dodson gave an stirring first speech.<br></strong></li> <li><strong>Jacqui Lambie warned the government to back off in the senate from rushing bills through when new senators were finding their feet.

<p>Welcome to Thursday on politics live. Deficits are the key today, sleep deficits that is. As you will see with <strong>Mike Bowers\u2019</strong> picture gallery, the press ball went to the wee hours last night. This is normally a midwinter event but, with the eight-week campaign, it became an almost spring ball.<br></p> <p>So with the coffee carts and the cafe packed to maximum capacity, we had best get on with the day. There is a lot around this morning. The government has 16 more bills coming to the parliament, including the company tax cuts. The Coalition agenda is dominated by budget measures but there were red faces all round late yesterday after Labor discovered a $107m counting error in the omnibus bill. The resulting mathematical haircut takes the value of the savings bill below $6bn.<br></p> <p>Labor is meeting with victims of shonky financial advisors to press the case for the bank royal commission. Labor\u2019s point is that the small business ombudsman\u2019s inquiry is not broad enough. <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/politics/labor-kept-at-bay-over-banks-20160831-gr5kes\">Phil Coorey at the Fin</a> reports the ombudsman <strong>Kate Carnell</strong> will be looking at 23 specific cases that were concerning Coalition bank critics. While this approach obviously stops those critics from crossing the floor, you do wonder about the rest of the victims who have not managed to make contact with a Coalition backbencher.<br></p> <p><strong>Bob Hawke</strong> is in the house! The former PM will be launching Anthony Albanese\u2019s biography by journalist <strong>Karen Middleton</strong> at 11am. I will bring pics and hopefully a bit of colour from that event.<br></p> <p>And at 9am, the current prime minister will be making a statement to the house regarding counter terrorism. I can\u2019t tell you anymore because ... actually, I don\u2019t know anymore than that.<br></p> <p>There\u2019s lots more besides. Stick around and chat in the thread. I\u2019m on the Twits @gabriellechan and he is @mpbowers. I\u2019m on my second litre of water, the sun is shining, the birds are singing and its the last sitting day of the parliament. What\u2019s not to love?</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T00:19:44.840Z\">at 1.19am BST</time></p>  </div>",

  "<p>Raihan Abir glances at the book in his hands, his eyes focused on the religious symbols that dot its reddish brown cover.

Abir and his wife were forced to flee Bangladesh, ending up in Toronto. </p> <p>The attacks are part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/11/bangladesh-murders-bloggers-foreigners-religion\">a killing spree that has targeted activists, bloggers and professors in Bangladesh</a>. Since 2013, extremists \u2013 many of them wielding machetes \u2013 have killed more than 50 bloggers, secularists, LGBT activists and religious minorities, according to Human Rights Watch. Scores of others have been seriously injured.</p> <p>Many of those killed had publicly expressed opinions on religion, science, sexuality or music. Both Isis and Ansar al-Islam, a militant group linked to al-Qaida, have claimed responsibility for the killings.</p> <p>The common thread linking the lives of many of the victims is <a href=\"https://mukto-mona.com/en\">Mukto-mona</a>, meaning Free Thinker, a Bengali-English website dedicated to the discussion of topics that range from atheism to science. Abir became involved with the site in 2007, drawn to what he describes as a window on to a world long hidden in conservative Bangladesh. </p> <p>\u201cI was living in a bubble with lots of propaganda fed to me by society,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was really easy to reach the age of 22 in Bangladesh and never hear about the science of evolution rather than intelligent design propaganda.\u201d </p> <p>When he and Roy released Philosophy of Disbelief, the book became an instant hit, feeding into the fledgling conversation ignited by websites such as Mukto-mona. </p> <p>But it also caught the attention of Islamist extremists who were determined to make Bangladesh reflect their own conservative beliefs .

Apprehension set in months later, after another blogger, Washiqur Rahman, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/30/blogger-hacked-death-bangladesh-dhaka\">hacked to death outside his home</a>. </p> <p>\u201cI knew it was my turn,\u201d Abir says with a wry smile. The idea began to permeate every moment of his life. Each morning his wife, Samia Hossain, would emerge first from their home to check for attackers. \u201cOnce she said it was clear, we would hit the road on our motorbike,\u201d he says. Hossain kept constant watch behind them as he drove. </p> <p>Despite the sweltering heat, he would keep his motorbike helmet on as walked through the university campus where he was completing his PhD in biomedical engineering. \u201cMy physician friends said you have to keep your helmet on to keep your head intact.\u201d </p> <p>When his PhD supervisor decided to attend a medical conference in Toronto, he urged Abir to join him and seek refuge in Canada. Abir hesitated, torn by the idea of leaving behind his research on the use of telemedicine in rural areas and still tied to the challenge of carving out a school of secular thought in the increasingly polarised country. </p> <p>The final push came with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/12/third-atheist-blogger-killed-in-bangladesh-after-knife-attack\">the death of Ananta Bijoy Das</a>, an editor of Philosophy of Disbelief. The two had been in constant contact as Das \u2013 worried about the death threats he was receiving \u2013 attempted to secure a visa to Sweden. Soon after his application was rejected by Swedish authorities, he was attacked by several masked men wielding machetes in broad daylight. </p> <p>In June of last year Abir travelled to Toronto, leaving behind Hossain who was six months pregnant at the time. Neither had any idea when they would see each other again. \u201cI knew that I might not be able to see her for three or four years,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Still, she was ecstatic to see him go. \u201cWhen the plane left and was in the air, I knew he would be alive. I was so happy,\u201d says Hossain. An architect by training, she followed in her husband\u2019s footsteps, applying for a visa to attend a conference in her field in Toronto. Two months later, a very pregnant Hossain was on a plane to Toronto.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it would be the happiest day of my life,\u201d says Abir. But while Hossain was in the air, news came of another death among their tight-knit circle of friends. Atheist blogger Niloy Neel had been hacked to death in his home. \u201cIt was a really stressful time,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were losing the brightest minds of Bangladesh one by one.\u201d </p> <p>Things soon began to fall into place for the young couple. Days after they found a place to call home in Toronto, their daughter Sophie was born. Their application for refugee status was accepted a few months later. </p> <p>Slowly the pair allowed themselves to shake off the fear that had coloured their lives in Dhaka. \u201cIn Bangladesh I literally would take one step and look behind my back. I wasn\u2019t supposed to be alive,\u201d says Abir as he sits at a table in the couple\u2019s sparsely decorated apartment. His wife nods sombrely in agreement as she sits next to him. \u201cYeah, he wasn\u2019t.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/11/bangladesh-murders-bloggers-foreigners-religion\">Inside Bangladesh\u2019s killing fields: bloggers and outsiders targeted by fanatics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Toronto\u2019s sizable Bangladeshi community, however, has meant the couple hasn\u2019t been able to let their guard down entirely.

So far, according to Human Rights Watch, this has largely translated into the detention of some 15,000 suspects with scant evidence. </p> <p>Thousands of miles away from Dhaka and its climate of fear, Abir\u2019s hope for the country continues to run deep. \u201cNow, yes we are being attacked, our atheist writers, our bloggers are refugees in the world. But things will change, Bangladesh is not like that.\u201d He continues to work with Mukto-mona, his passion for its ideas now accompanied by a deep sense of responsibility as one of the few who made it out alive.</p> <p>His focus is now on the dozens of Bangladeshi writers still under threat in the country, many of them in hiding and fearing for their lives. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make connections with the outer world and get them to safe places.

His own family (original name: Drumpf) came from Germany, settling in the US a little more than a decade before the first world war.</p> <p>And yet, Candidate Trump proposed what he called \u201cideological certification\u201d of immigrants to check their real intent. That was the only way to weed out criminals and terrorists, who somehow blended into one giant alien blob in his combed-over cranium.</p> <p>Trump painted a portrait of a nation overrun by hordes of unassimilated aliens stampeding across the southern border, determined to butcher innocent Americans.</p> <p>Never mind that most undocumented immigrants enter the country by plane and overstay their visas.

He has already confused the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who told the world that Mexico would not pay for the Great Wall of Trump. \u201cI made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall,\u201d the president said bluntly.</p> <p>Trump himself had a different take. \u201cWe did discuss the wall,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss payment of the wall.

At this point, he walked across the stage and applauded himself. </p> <p>\u201cAnd Mexico will pay for the wall. 100%. They don\u2019t know it yet, but they\u2019re going to pay for it.\u201d</p> <p>No, they clearly don\u2019t know it. But there were some clues left by some Trump staffers.

  "<p>\u201cHope springs eternal\u201d, declared Alexander Pope in 1733. More than ever this year have I needed hope \u2013 and I found it, nestled in the pages of poetry.</p> <p>Earlier this summer, a word was hurled at me on the street by a stranger: \u201cLeave.\u201d Only one syllable and a second long, but it stayed with me. It was the day after the EU referendum results and in the two months since, racist incidents have been rising across the UK. Language itself seems to have been hijacked by toxic political discourse: small words such as \u201cleave\u201d, \u201cimmigrant\u201d, \u201cdemocracy\u201d, \u201cdecent\u201d, \u201chuman\u201d, and \u201creal\u201d have taken on sinister meanings. </p> <p>The word \u201creal\u201d was hijacked by Ukip, with Nigel Farage declaring Brexit a victory for \u201creal people\u201d. The title of a book on my shelf leapt out at me: <a href=\"http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/ecs/product/staying-alive-709\">Staying Alive: Real Poems for Unreal Times</a> (one of a trilogy of Bloodaxe poetry anthologies, alongside Being Alive and Being Human). Dehumanising language is designed to cause despair. But reading cast off the accumulated layers of false meaning around the words, and gave language back to me. Who and what is real, and who and what is unreal? Poets have long been grappling with these ideas, as in TS Eliot\u2019s haunting evocation of an \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/47311\">Unreal City</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf we look to poets for anything at a time when abuse of power goes hand in hand with abuse of language,\u201d writes Neil Astley in the Staying Alive introduction, it\u2019s for \u201ctheir vigilance in defending and continually revitalising the language\u201d. Here there are voices from across history and around the world, translated from languages as various as Persian and Polish, speaking of love and loss, of finding hope in the midst of despair. There is Rumi (reminding us to \u201cWalk out like someone suddenly born into colour\u201d). There is Yeats (\u201c<a href=\"http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/he-wishes-for-the-cloths-of-heaven/\">I, being poor, have only dreams</a>\u201d). There is Langston Hughes (encouraging us to \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/dreams\">hold fast to dreams</a>\u201d). Some of the most poignant poems speak of the search for a home, and are a timely reminder of the crisis of refugees throughout history, such as WH Auden\u2019s hugely powerful 1939 poem <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/refugee-blues/\">Refugee Blues</a>:</p> <p>\u201cSay this city has ten million souls,<br>Some are living in mansions, some are living in holes:<br>Yet there\u2019s no place for us, my dear, yet there\u2019s no place for us.<br>[\u2026]<br>The consul banged the table and said,<br>\u2018If you\u2019ve got no passport you\u2019re officially dead\u2019:<br>But we are still alive, my dear, but we are still alive.\u201d</p> <p>Flowing through the lines of even the bleakest of poems is that assertion of life.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The title resonates in a year where death has taken some of our finest. How to stay hopeful when we lose those whom we love? I recently experienced the loss of a loved one, and I turned to poetry as a life raft. Poetry buoyed me up from sinking into despair; I memorise short poems so I can hold the whole of them in my head, so I can conjure them to mind when walking down a dark, lonely street.</p> <p>As with all anthologies, it\u2019s a book that makes us turn to other books. So from these pages, I discovered other poems I loved, and many were filled with hope: </p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/42889\">Hope is the thing with feathers</a> <br>That perches in the soul \u2014 <br>And sings the tune without the words \u2014 <br>And never stops \u2014 at all \u2014 \u201d, wrote Emily Dickinson in 1891. <br></p> <p>Astley writes: \u201cIn politics, television, newspapers and advertising, language is often negative, reductive, stripped of full expression to put across a message \u2013 it\u2019s spun or twisted out of recognition \u2026 Instead of being used to communicate, it is used to control thinking, as a tool of power.\u201d Poetry is the antidote to such abuse of words. </p> <p>As the first leaves of autumn fall, I won\u2019t leave these streets I call home. I won\u2019t give in to fear and despair, I\u2019ll stay, and stay alive.</p>",
  "<p>The end of the summer is an occasion that surely deserves to be marked with a celebratory drink. And what could be more redolent of summer sunshine than that stone-cold tropical classic, the planter\u2019s punch? As with many old recipes, there is no definitive version \u2013 the planter\u2019s is a pleasingly laid-back affair that goes by many names, depending on where you are in the Caribbean \u2026 but, however horizontal things get, there are a few non-negotiables.</p> <p>For a start, it is always rum-based; this is a drink that apparently had its origins in Jamaica, at a time when rum was both cheap and in need of a little help in the flavour department in the form of two other local crops: lime juice and sugar. The results were so refreshing \u2013 and delicious \u2013 that it\u2019s still popular, even though its main ingredient is now smooth enough to be sipped solo. From these simple beginnings, the planter\u2019s punch has evolved into a tiki bar fantasy, bright with fruit and bristling with umbrellas. Is less more in this instance \u2013 or is more always merrier?</p> <h2>The boozy base</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee5d3ec45dff649a8bb4ee5481a3731cdfac00c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee5d3ec45dff649a8bb4ee5481a3731cdfac00c2/228_106_3338_2491/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Larousse suggests an amber variety of rum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"746\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Larousse suggests an amber variety of rum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Originally, this would have generally been made with dark Jamaica rum, and most modern recipes still call for this. Cocktail guru Dale DeGroff, though, uses a mixture of dark and light in his book The Craft of the Cocktail, and the 17th-century recipe quoted in Larousse Cocktails suggests an amber variety. Meanwhile, Difford\u2019s Guide: 365 Days of Cocktails recommends the lethal overproof kind that I can find only in a white incarnation.</p> <p>Although golden rum is my usual drink of choice, here I think the dark sort makes more sense; its treacly, molasses quality stands up well to the other ingredients. Clean-cut white rum drowns in the welter of sweet and sour, and even the more emphatic demerara-like qualities of golden are wasted; a rum punch demands a blunderbuss in the form of the dark stuff.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>DeGroff also uses orange cura\u00e7ao, another quintessentially Caribbean drink, but one that seems like gilding the lily. The only boozy note required in a planter\u2019s punch is rum, and lots of it.</p> <h2>The sour</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"472a6f26b926b8e5fb3f562b783f86f00d5fbd9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/472a6f26b926b8e5fb3f562b783f86f00d5fbd9b/0_191_3648_2484/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Regan\u2019s rum punch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Regan\u2019s rum punch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the fine tradition of thirst-quenching tropical pours, it also has a hefty acidic element, which is traditionally provided by lime juice. <a href=\"http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00078627/00033/93j\">A recipe in the September 1878 issue of the British magazine Fun</a> calls for lemon, but I assume that is because they were more easily available in Victorian Britain (although I\u2019m willing to stand corrected). Gary Regan\u2019s The Joy of Mixology and Trader Vic\u2019s use both, but I can\u2019t see the point, when the keener, greener sharpness of the lime plays off so well against the sweeter elements.<br></p> <h2>The bitters</h2> <p>A popular addition, although not mentioned in the oldest recipes. Most modern versions call for the iconic Angostura bitters, but Regan also adds a dash of the sweeter, lighter New Orleans classic, Peychaud\u2019s. Perhaps more delicate palates than ours would be able to pick this detail up, but as long as you include some sort of bitter element, the exact kind isn\u2019t too important. </p> <h2>The sweet</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1d6d341c2d9faaffb4925e1eb1501d5218b36da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1d6d341c2d9faaffb4925e1eb1501d5218b36da/0_174_3648_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Difford\u2019s rum punch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"680\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Difford\u2019s rum punch ... uses sugar syrup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although he deploys two kinds of bitters, Regan is unusual in choosing not to balance them with sugar, preferring to stick with fruit juices (of which more later). Stephen Remsberg, a rum collector <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/07/planters-punch-cocktail-recipe.html\">whose recipe is published on the Serious Eats website</a>, uses sugar syrup, that bartending staple also favoured by DeGroff and Difford\u2019s Guide. Trader Vic\u2019s and Fun magazine prefer straight sugar, but making a sugar solution doesn\u2019t take more than five minutes, and it mixes far more easily into the drink. Eschew sugar altogether and you\u2019ll end up with a mouth-puckeringly acidic result.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>DeGroff, Larousse and Trader Vic\u2019s use grenadine syrup to give what David Wondrich, writing in Esquire, calls a \u201ccrazy colour\u201d and a red-berry sweetness. It feels appropriately gaudy, but the fruity flavour changes the character of the drink, robbing it of its simplicity.<br></p> <h2>The mixers</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c2c28107d0469bdd864bc0e27214b0004620464\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c2c28107d0469bdd864bc0e27214b0004620464/0_338_3648_2189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dale DeGroff\u2019s rum punch ... a long, sweet, fruity drink.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dale DeGroff\u2019s rum punch ... a long, sweet, fruity drink.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The oldest recipes are watered down by the simplest means available \u2013 water. DeGroff prefers sparkling soda water, and also adds both orange and pineapple juice for good measure, while Regan goes for orange and grapefruit, which, while they point up the bitter notes in his recipe, again distract from the key flavours of rum, lime and sugar. If you want a long, sweet, fruity drink, then DeGroff\u2019s is the one to go for, but water makes for a more refreshing experience.</p> <h2>The mixing</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdcfce9fc9a3f14f5a7f49dbf7840dc5d0c3820f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdcfce9fc9a3f14f5a7f49dbf7840dc5d0c3820f/0_245_3648_2491/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trader Vic\u2019s rum punch: stir over crushed ice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trader Vic\u2019s rum punch: stir over crushed ice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The recipes I try are fairly evenly split between those that stir the drink over crushed ice, such as Remsberg, Larousse and Trader Vic\u2019s, and those that shake it and then serve it on the rocks (Regan and DeGroff), with Fun making no mention of ice at all, again perhaps because it wasn\u2019t likely to be widely available to its readers.

It\u2019s pretty long. Here are just a couple:</p> <h2><strong>On people illegally in the US</strong></h2> <p><strong>Trump</strong>: \u201cThey\u2019re treated better than our vets.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The facts:</strong> People in the country illegally do not have the right to work, vote or receive most government benefits. A modest number have been exempted from deportation because of an Obama administration action, but most live under the risk of being removed from the country.</p> <p>Veterans are guaranteed government health care and because almost all are citizens, the right to vote and other government benefits.</p> <p>The quality of their care has been criticized by Trump and others, but people in the country illegally do not have equivalent rights to health care, except for emergency treatment. Public hospitals are required to provide emergency medical care regardless of immigration status.</p> <h2>On the number of people in the US illegally</h2> <p><strong>Trump:</strong> \u201cOur government has no idea. It could be 3 million, it could be 30 million. They have no idea.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The facts:</strong> The government actually has an idea. The homeland security department estimates there are 11.4 million people in the United States illegally. Few in the immigration debate challenge that estimate.</p> <p>The figure comes from an analysis of the most recent census data. The government compares the number of people whom the census reports as foreign-born with the number of people who have been admitted legally and gained citizenship. The most recent estimate dates to January 2012. It roughly matches the estimates of demographers from the Pew Foundation, which issues its estimates more rapidly than the government.</p> <p>Experts believe the number of people in the US illegally has been steadily declining as Mexicans and others return to their home country and illegal border crossings dwindle.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c7967be4b0df5f040dc160\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T03:00:52.067Z\">4.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Today in Campaign 2016</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Let\u2019s just focus on the key aspects of Donald Trump\u2019s speech:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51af965c8b9d2f6a24fa4df8ecc7f17981d1ed44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51af965c8b9d2f6a24fa4df8ecc7f17981d1ed44/0_0_4128_2752/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump\u2019s speech on immigration, anticipated by some to be a \u201csoftening\u201d - as the candidate himself described it - on the issue, instead was a retrenchment in some of his most aggressive policies, including ideological tests for would-be visa applicants and the creation of a deportation force to hunt down undocumented immigrants residing in the United States, and included some new ones that have never been mentioned by a mainstream presidential candidate in the modern era.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s proposals included: the construction of a 2,000-mile border wall along the US-Mexico border, to be paid for by Mexico; the implementation of new restrictions on legal immigration into the US; a \u201csunset\u201d on visa laws requiring Congress to rewrite them every few years; a ban on taxpayer funding for cities that don\u2019t deport undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>The tone of the speech was not dissimilar to that of a Breitbart News article on the subject - appropriate, given that Trump campaign operatives revealed to reporters after the speech\u2019s commencement that former Breitbart chair Stephen Bannon was instrumental in the speech\u2019s crafting.</p> <p>The tone of the speech outpaces even Trump\u2019s own aggressive rhetoric on undocumented immigrants, and effectively puts the lid on any claims that he is moving towards the center with less than 70 days to go until the general election.</p> <p>Not all conservatives are pleased, however.</p> <p>A member of Donald Trump\u2019s evangelical advisory board:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tonysuarez80/status/771176763166646272\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Extremely disappointed.</p>&mdash; Tony Suarez-NHCLC VP (@tonysuarez80) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tonysuarez80/status/771176763166646272\">September 1, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c795c3e4b0f6cb85628bed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T02:45:53.618Z\">3.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Donald Trump, in conclusion:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.

We rec the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders to stop the illegal movement of people, weapons and drugs,\u201d Trump said. The move is \u201cparamount to both the United States and to Mexico.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNumber three: Dismantling drug cartels,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis can only be done with cooperation, and intelligence and intelligence sharing.</p> <p>\u201cImproving Nafta, number four. Nafta is a 22-year-old agreement that must be update to reflect the realities of today,\u201d Trump said, which would make both countries \u201cstronger and keep industry in our hemisphere. We have tremendous competition from China and from all over the world. Keep it in our hemisphere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNumber five: Keep manufacturing wealth in our hemisphere. When jobs leave Mexico, the US or Central America and go overseas, it increases poverty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe bond between our two countries is deep and sincere, and both our nations benefit from a close and honest relationship between our two governments.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI call you a friend.

The manor has four rooms and an apartment, all done out in Breton stripes and nautical chic. The table d\u2019h\u00f4tes set dinner, which Fran\u00e7oise prepares herself, usually involves fish and seafood, such as thick slabs of cod, prawns and crab. As the local fishermen don\u2019t go out on Sundays, a typical Monday evening meal might be melon and mint soup, then chicken in cider followed by roast peach with gingerbread.

Their cat, Rokey, spends most of the day sunning himself on the terrace, where two huge trees acts as giant parasols for outdoor meals.

  "<p><em></em>On 23 July, two men joined the crowd of thousands of Afghanistan\u2019s Hazara marching in protest through the streets of Kabul. They wore suicide vests under billowing <em>perahan</em>.</p> <p>The Hazara protest was, ostensibly, in response to the Afghan government\u2019s decision to divert a promised power transmission line from Bamiyan \u2013 a Hazara enclave, where it would have brought jobs, economic growth and, most fundamentally, electricity \u2013 to another area of the country further north.

  "<p>Two centuries ago, after the Napoleonic wars had laid waste to large parts of central Europe, the continent\u2019s rulers decided to redraw the border between Austria and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a> along the Saalach river, right between Salzburg and one of its suburbs, now a Bavarian town called Freilassing. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/austria\">Austria</a> joined the Schengen area in 1995, the border in effect became obsolete: only a short white line in the middle of the motorway bridge still marks the division between the two countries.</p> <p>But a year ago this month, the Freilassing bridge once again become a symbol of the barriers between nations and cultures. At lunchtime on Saturday 5 September 2015 \u2013 a day after Germany\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\">Angela Merkel</a> and the then Austrian chancellor, Werner Faymann, had decided to accept thousands of refugees stranded at Budapest central station \u2013 it was here that about 400 refugees on board a train got their first glimpse of Germany.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96768820e3852e1481d428e4e4c7033fad4b840a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96768820e3852e1481d428e4e4c7033fad4b840a/0_203_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police check migrants in September 2015 in  Freilassing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police check migrants in September 2015 in Freilassing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guenter Schiffmann/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it was on Freilassing bridge that a week later thousands of refugees found themselves stranded once again after Germany\u2019s interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, reintroduced border checks that continue sporadically to this day, leading to tumultuous scenes that have left the border town divided in more ways than one.</p> <p>Rainer Borchers, 38, remembers returning from his night shift as a hospital nurse in the early hours to find hundreds of people camped outside his home on the Bavarian bank of the Saalach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bd01c906fb803b260135a2de18dfefe891c2a0ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd01c906fb803b260135a2de18dfefe891c2a0ba/132_362_4636_2781/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rainer Borchers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rainer Borchers, disillusioned at the main parties\u2019 response to his concerns about immigration, joined the right-wing AfD.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jens Schwarz/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThese people were in a lot of need: they were exhausted, thirsty and hungry.

He claimed he was spat at and threatened with a knife when handing out bottles of water, and one night heard shots on the bridge \u2013 police insist the banging sound was created by a van running over a traffic cone. </p> <p>\u201cGenerators were running 24 hours a day and made my bedroom vibrate. I bought this house with my own money, and as a carer it\u2019s not like I earn \u20ac5,000 a month.\u201d<br></p> <p>Borchers said he remembered \u201cpositive moments\u201d from his week of volunteering, but in the coming weeks he became more and more disillusioned.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had anything to do with politics, but I called the Social Democrats to complain, I called the mayor of Freilassing, and I called the district office, but none of them would listen to me.\u201d Then, he said, he called a nearby branch of Germany\u2019s new rightwing anti-immigration party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), \u201cand they took the time to listen\u201d. He has since joined the party.</p> <p>On 24 October, the AfD held a demonstration with more than 1,000 protesters and several hundred counter-demonstrators against Merkel\u2019s \u201cillegal\u201d management of the crisis. </p> <p>A year on, Borchers said, his town feels \u201cscarred\u201d. \u201cMy neighbourhood is divided between left and right \u2013 there\u2019s nothing in between. You are either pro-refugee or against.\u201d</p> <p>Others in the town disagree. Mayor Josef Flatscher said descriptions of Freilassing as a town divided were \u201ccompletely over the top\u201d. Last September the politician, a member of the conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union party, was driving back from a family holiday in Italy when he heard the news of the resumption of border checks between Austria and Germany on the radio. But when he drove across the bridge into his hometown an hour later, there were no border guards to be seen.</p> <p>The next morning, local police set up makeshift patrols in the middle of the bridge. By the afternoon, they were replaced with members of the national police force, who still carry out sporadic border checks.</p> <p>Twelve months on, Flatscher said: \u201cI feel reassured about the situation in Freilassing, but of course we are keeping an eye on the broader macroclimate,\u201d pointing to news of 6,500 migrants being rescued off the Libyan coast in a single day this week. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to stop completely.

Having arrived in Germany in November 2014, the 21-year-old Syrian shares a room with three other young men, on the ground floor of a spacious three-storey house with a little garden and several large trees in the front, home to 60 refugees who have been located here while their asylum applications are being processed. The ground floor is reserved for men, one side for Arabic speakers, mainly from Syria, the other side for refugees who speak other languages, most of them from African countries.</p> <p>Last September and October, when about 1,500 refugees arrived on the bridge from Salzburg every day, Misho had already been in Germany for almost a year and spoke basic German. \u201cSo I went to the bridge to support volunteers who distributed food and clothes and to help with translations. Both German officials and refugees seemed grateful when I helped, but a few times it turned out that the presumed Syrians didn\u2019t speak any Arabic at all. I have no idea where they were from, but certainly not from Syria as they had claimed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-31T17:03:41/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Migration registrations in Germany from August 2015 to July 2016\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-31T17:03:41/embed.html\">Migration registrations in Germany from August 2015 to July 2016</a> <figcaption>Migration registrations in Germany from August 2015 to July 2016</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since then, the number of arrivals has dropped considerably. According to Germany\u2019s federal refugee agency, no more than 40 refugees and migrants a day arrive at Freilassing\u2019s reception centre. The shelter, in a former furniture factory, was working at an \u201coperative minimum\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are lucky here in our house with the refugees, as there is some green space in front and we all get along well with each other. I am still really grateful to Germany that I can be here and there are a lot of people in town who are happy to help us.\u201d</p> <p>Some people in Freilassing, Misho said, \u201cmaybe one in five\u201d, seemed less happy about their presence. \u201cA few times people have even told me that I shouldn\u2019t be here. But then I always just answer them in German and then they are intimidated and confused by the fact that I speak German. That is my best way to defend myself.\u201d</p> <p>At the start of September, Misho is starting a new job in a restaurant at Chiemsee, a nearby lake and tourist destination. He would mainly be preparing salads, he said, but hoped he could work his way up.</p> <p>Yet not every refugee who made it across the Freilassing bridge has reason to be hopeful. Alhough police on the bridge currently only carry out sporadic spot checks, border control has in effect been moved inland to the reception centres where refugees and migrants first arrive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b37226639982e9a1188b0071fb595faa1562279\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b37226639982e9a1188b0071fb595faa1562279/0_1366_4270_2562/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police control at the border bridge checkpoint in August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police at the bridge checkpoint on the Saalach river last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jens Schwarz/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those who cannot show a passport or show an intention to apply for political asylum are sent back across the border to Austria \u2013 in August, German police returned 300 migrants from Freilassing to Salzburg.

With a marker pen, he drew a fat A on the wrists of the first 10 people in the queue, then set up a dividing line on the ground. The next 10 got a B, the next 10 a C, and so on. Soon, M\u00fcller was on to decimal places.</p> <p>After a few days, one of the local papers likened M\u00fcller\u2019s system to the Nazis marking up Jewish prisoners in a concentration camp, which made the pensioner very cross. \u201cAll we were trying to do was to create a just, fair system,\u201d he said. The deputy mayor of Salzburg eventually donated boxes full of colourful wristbands normally used at political rallies, which M\u00fcller used instead.</p> <p>After months of volunteering, during which he often slept for little more than two to three hours a night in a makeshift bed in one of the camps, M\u00fcller is ambivalent about the future, drawn between sympathy for anyone trying to make their way into Germany and understanding for those who are worried about the long-term effects of immigration. \u201cYou have to respect everyone who doesn\u2019t want more refugees. We can manage this, but only if the population at large is involved in the process.\u201d</p> <p>With his vast archive of documents, wristbands and children\u2019s drawings, he plans to set up a museum in his home. \u201cSomeone has to keep the story of what happened here last year alive.\u201d</p>",

He quickly <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/25/politics/trump-no-legal-status-for-undocumented-immigrants/\">backed off</a> that statement \u2013 the result was a policy that looked like a muddled mess, as even rightwing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/30/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-hacking-threat-election-live?page=with:block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69#block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69\">admitted</a> of the nominee: \u201cI never took him seriously on immigration.\u201d </p> <p>There had been signs, too, of a moderate tone earlier on Wednesday when Trump met with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto on a surprise visit to Mexico City. At a press stop with Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Trump was restrained and talked about illegal immigration as a humanitarian crisis, claiming that he didn\u2019t discuss with the Mexican president his infamous pledge that Mexico would pay for a border wall.</p> <p>It turned out this was only technically true \u2013 there was no discussion, but only because the Mexican president had immediately begun their conversation by saying he would not pay.</p> <p>In his Phoenix speech Trump brushed all that off. \u201cMexico will pay for the wall, 100%. They don\u2019t know it yet but they\u2019re going to pay for it.\u201d</p> <p>Trump renewed his call for what he called a deportation taskforce. Without using its title he yet again endorsed Operation Wetback, the infamous Eisenhower-era policy of mass deportation, while lamenting shortcomings. \u201cThey would drop them across, right across, and they\u2019d come back.\u201d Instead Trump pledged to take those he deported \u201cgreat distances\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>He repeated testimonials from the parents of Americans killed by undocumented immigrants, using these to frame the issue not as humanitarian or even economic, but about crime and \u201cthe wellbeing of the American people\u201d.</p> <p>Trump did not explicitly call for the all-out deportation of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States \u2013 something he has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/09/11/donald-trump-says-immigrant-deportations-done-in-two-years/\">signaled support</a> for in the past despite even most immigration hawks opposing the idea. But he still insisted: \u201cAnyone who enters the United States illegally is subject to deportation, otherwise we don\u2019t have a country.\u201d</p> <p>Trump did not touch on the controversial topic of birthright citizenship, which he has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/19/birthright-citizenship-history-law-donald-trump-republicans\">opposed in the past</a>, even to the point of claiming this constitutional provision can be reversed with an act of Congress \u2013 a view few credible legal scholars would endorse.</p> <p>The theater around the speech felt like a reversion to Trump\u2019s rowdy ways in the primary race. \u201cThis will not be a rally speech per se,\u201d he said at the outset. But nor was it a detailed policy rollout. Much of it comprised traditional talking points and railing against Hillary Clinton, while taking detours to mock \u201cmedia elites\u201d who viewed \u201cglobal warming\u201d as a problem.</p> <p>Down to the \u201cMake Mexico Great Again Also\u201d hats, worn by the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, it was a return to the unpredictable showmanship that has defined Trump\u2019s campaign. Red meat for his party\u2019s conservative base, with nothing to attract moderate suburbanites, let alone Latinos or African Americans, who have been alienated by his harsh rhetoric.</p> <p>It represented the final chapter in what has been a back and forth debate within his campaign about whether Trump should try to act like a conventional candidate or simply be himself. That debate outlasted multiple campaign managers, the Republican primary itself, and continued well into the general election.</p> <p>It is now over. There will not be a more moderate Trump, there will not be a more compassionate Trump.</p> <p>Instead the same candidate who announced that Mexicans are \u201cbringing drugs, bringing crime, they\u2019re rapists\u201d is the one who will appear before voters in November.</p>"
