  "<p>The descent into Queenstown, Tasmania, is one of disparate and formidable beauty. As the Lyell highway wends its way through hairpin bends, the surrounding mountainsides shed world heritage forest, shed trees of any kind, becoming the region\u2019s famed lunar dreamscape. The magenta, ochre and smoky-green hues of the denuded hillsides are remarkable to look at, cast in a slightly different glow at every turn, recalling the mesas of New Mexico, or the Painted Desert (Arizona or South Australia, whichever you fancy). </p> <p>But this beauty is complicated by its genesis \u2013 more than a century of extensive mining has decimated the area: minerals are hauled out of the earth, and decades of sulphurous smelter fumes allow little in the way of regeneration. </p> <p>Beauty and devastation is but the first of many incongruous pairings to be encountered over the course of Queenstown\u2019s three-day arts festival, <a href=\"http://www.theunconformity.com.au/\">the Unconformity</a>. </p> <p>A remote and depleted mining town may seem an unlikely location for an arts festival. Previously called the Queenstown Heritage and Arts festival, the biennial event\u2019s latest iteration was held in the wake of the 2014 Lyell copper mine closures that brought an eerie quiet to the streets, and spurred the departure of many residents. The 2016 name change references one of the geological phenomena of the area. Geologically speaking, an unconformity is an abrupt shift in strata, an eroded age \u2013 in the case of the Queenstown unconformity, about 35m years.</p> <p>The name doubles as a mission statement, encouraging an embrace of the paradoxes that make this festival distinct.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ec1bb94481d5b3ad3d66eeb9a39ee561b81bfa30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec1bb94481d5b3ad3d66eeb9a39ee561b81bfa30/0_0_4608_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flux, a project by Liquid Architecture and the Unconscious Collective\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flux, a project by Liquid Architecture and the Unconscious Collective, which took over an old limestone quarry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Ross</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sky is starkly, coldly clear for the opening-night event, The Rumble: a large-scale sound installation by the Hobart-based composer Dylan Sheridan, who incorporates salvaged mining machinery. The procession of mining trucks was once an annual Christmastime happening. Tonight, the distant thunder of the trucks and the initial hammer chimes of the composition resonate ominously through Queenstown\u2019s streets before headlights appear through the first dark and The Rumble grinds towards the heart of the town.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe rock crusher emits a very distinctive major third \u2013 F and A \u2013 which I based all of the harmony around,\u201d Sheridan explains. \u201cThe idea was to start with a menacing, harsh sort of sound world of hammers and drills and horns and machinery, and turn it into a sort of cacophonous celebration of what the town was and is. Ultimately I wanted it to be hopeful.\u201d </p> <p>One of the festival\u2019s greater successes is much of the program\u2019s calibre and tenacity. The Unconformity does not suffer from the underestimation of audience that so often undermines regional arts festivals.<br></p> <p>The festival director, Travis Tiddy, has stressed the vitality of an artistic program that responds to the region. The percussionist Matthias Schack-Arnott\u2019s immersive, elemental Fault Traces is visually and sonically exquisite. Using subsonic frequencies and a plethora of organic materials, it evokes tectonic murmurings and the frenetic desiccation of shell, wood, stone and metal, giving way to the late, mechanised pound of heavy industry \u2013 the audible memory of a mountain.</p> <p>This focus on deep time is revisited and refracted throughout a number of the works. Rock is \u201cfull of slower, longer thoughts than mind can have\u201d, Mish Grigor and Zoe Scoglio tell us in We Are Mountain, giving a shout-out to Ursula K Le Guin. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3e8ff9e234204593923924f3873aceef2c72d3ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e8ff9e234204593923924f3873aceef2c72d3ba/674_0_3590_3472/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edible Mt Lyell by Fiona Ebert, Carol Murphy, Mish Grigor and Zoe Scoglio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"967\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edible Mount Lyell by Fiona Ebert, Carol Murphy, Mish Grigor and Zoe Scoglio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Ross</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their participatory performance begins with the audience being bussed up to Iron Blow, the open-cut mine where Mount Lyell\u2019s mining industry began. The en-route scripting makes for a idiomatic audio guide. <em>The earliest thing we know about this area \u2026</em> It\u2019s an imagined sequence of oral histories, staggering back through the strata of inhabitants and their relationship to the mountain, past mineral industry and the prospectors who came in search of it, past the West Coast Range\u2019s first people, to the Cretaceous organisms that form the fossiliferous rock. </p> <p>For We Are Mountain\u2019s conclusion, Scoglio and Grigor have enlisted the help of locals Fiona Ebert \u2013 the baker of much-coveted banana cakes at the Queenstown markets \u2013 and the sculptor Carol Murphy, to create an edible Mount Lyell that the audience is invited to descend upon with dessert spoons. </p> <p>\u201cThis goes against all my health and safety training,\u201d a local nurse says, grinning and digging her spoon into the iridescent icing.</p> <p>The multi-disciplinary performance Geologies makes reverent use of the fading Masonic Hall in which it is staged. Somehow the old pews and blistered paint seem in accord, so too the eight hanging overhead lamps shaded by milky glass, the lone fluorescent bulb illuminating the violinist\u2019s solo. The dancer Wendy Morrow\u2019s final movements are performed by torchlight, the beam directed by the composer, Leigh Hobba.<br></p> <p>The ethos of working with available materials extends to the performance itself; Morrow\u2019s gestures presented as in immediate response to Hobba\u2019s delivered litanies of words, technical instructions \u2013 how to tie a sheet bend, for instance \u2013 and crashing impromptu piano. </p> <p>During this performance it occurs that a face is never more compelling \u2013 or beautiful \u2013 than when listening, intent. This is true of both audience and dancer; and the still, reflective intensity of Morrow\u2019s inward gaze is as arresting as gesture. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21531f198305b5d6bfc07a5f4cd670271c2c6421\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21531f198305b5d6bfc07a5f4cd670271c2c6421/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dancer Wendy Morrow\u2019s final movements are performed by torchlight in Geologies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dancer Wendy Morrow\u2019s final movements are performed by torchlight in Geologies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Robert-Tissot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each night the festival club resembles the late hours of an unlikely wedding, with boundaries between locals and incomers dissolving on the dance floor where Bruce Springsteen, as ever, proves the great unifier. (Try not dancing to Dancing in the Dark in an underground club with pink-carpeted walls. Just try.)<br></p> <p>The festival culminates on Queenstown\u2019s infamous gravel football pitch for the Unconformity Cup: the West v the Rest. Ours and Theirs are intermingled in the grandstand. Up close, the gravel is mercifully finer than imagined. It rains steadily throughout all four quarters, underscoring why a turf pitch might prove impractical here. There was an early-morning attempt to paint in ground markings but the rain has soaked the paint into the pitch, where it has leached out into wide magenta stains, mirroring those of the mountains. </p> <p>The Hobart writer Michael Blake, ostensibly of the Rest, was a late recruit to the West, playing half-back flank. \u201cI was a bit trepidatious, going in,\u201d he says afterwards. \u201cBut there was much less savagery than expected. A lot of blood, though \u2013 they were pretty laissez-faire about the blood rule.\u201d </p> <p>The final score: 46-30, the West. The way it was always going to go, but perhaps at a slightly more respectable margin. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8bec9e7775a65b2dc839c29bce5e8838b647581e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bec9e7775a65b2dc839c29bce5e8838b647581e/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The West v the Rest play on Queenstown\u2019s infamous gravel football pitch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018They were pretty laissez-faire about the blood rule\u2019: the West v the Rest play on Queenstown\u2019s infamous gravel football pitch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Robert-Tissot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMining is full of the unexpected, of sudden wealth and rapid decay,\u201d the historian Geoffrey Blainey wrote, six decades ago, in The Peaks of Lyell. \u201cAll mining fields must eventually die and most old men of the west know this bitterly.\u201d<br></p> <p>Following the Lyell Highway back east, amid the mountains and their long, slow thoughts \u2013 their secrets \u2013 the sense of deep time lingers. No small thing for a town to imagine itself differently, towards a future in which industry and place are not exclusively synonymous, and the view from the Unconformity feels anything but bitter.</p>",

Don\u2019t tell me that it\u2019s difficult because the British don\u2019t want it. </p> <p>\u201cIf we entered international negotiations in that spirit, there would never be any negotiations.

In 2004, he received a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/feb/04/france.jonhenley\">14-month suspended sentence</a> and was barred from holding elected office for a year over a corrupt 1980s scheme that illegally put workers for Jacques Chirac\u2019s party on the payroll of the Paris town hall.</p> <p>However, the conviction has not so far come back to haunt him. It is accepted that he did not profit personally and instead he is seen as having taken the flak for Chirac.</p> <p>At his campaign headquarters on Paris\u2019s left bank, he stuck by his promise to lead a diverse France that could live together harmoniously. He said his concept of \u201chappy national identity\u201d was clearly not the current reality in France, but a collective aim. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not so naive as to think that France is swimming in happiness \u2013 France today is in great difficulty. Economically our unemployment is still very high, particularly among young people, and politically the current leadership has lost all credibility,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the role of a politician is not to bring a message of pessimism and decline, but to share confidence and optimism.\u201d</p> <p>Jupp\u00e9\u2019s take on positive French community relations is an attack on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/07/how-nicolas-sarkozys-presidential-days-came-back-to-haunt-him\">Sarkozy\u2019s hardline brand</a> of national identity politics, focused on immigration and Islam, which has dominated the headlines.

We\u2019re not going to ban all women from wearing a headscarf! You can\u2019t decree laws that can\u2019t be respected.\u201d</p> <p>Of the ceremony to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/nice-attackers-links-isis-not-yet-established-french-minister-bernard-cazeneuve\">commemorate the victims</a> of the Nice terrorist attack, in which 86 people were killed when a lorry driver <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/lorry-rams-bastille-day-crowd-in-nice-killing-at-least-70\">ploughed into crowds</a> celebrating Bastille Day, he said: \u201cWe saw families that were Christian, Muslim, of every faith and origin. And those people told us that dialogue and the will to stand together could fight unhappiness, hatred and antagonism.\u201d</p> <p>Asked whether he thought France was impossible to reform economically, he said: \u201cEvery country is hard to reform. France maybe more than others, I admit, but it\u2019s also moving, our universities have transformed themselves, lots of sectors of public life have been transformed.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<p>\u2022 We got some of the chronology wrong in a story about Gary Lineker\u2019s criticism on Twitter of \u201chideously racist\u201d comments about young refugees being resettled in Britain from the camp in Calais (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/gary-lineker-hits-back-at-online-abuse-over-hideously-racist-coverage-refugees\" title=\"\">Lineker strikes back</a>, 20 October, page 8).

In fact the paper published those quoted words on Wednesday, a day after Lineker\u2019s tweet. The Sun was one of several publications that ran articles on Tuesday in which the age of the refugees was questioned.</p> <p>\u2022 Homophone corner: \u201cHe was just an ordinary kid for whom the concepts of self-determination or shrugging off the Yankee yolk were as alien as nuclear physics\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/16/obama-pardon-mandela-puerto-rico-oscar-lopez-rivera-\" title=\"\">\u2018I\u2019m no threat\u2019</a>, 17 October, page 4, G2).</p>",

These words were addressed to me by adolescent and adult asylum seeker and refugee students during my 15 months as a teacher at the Nauru Regional Processing Centre. Besides the way they were treated and the conditions in the camp, this sense of worthlessness was also fuelled by how the refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru were portrayed in the Australian media. </p> <p>It was largely for this reason I agreed to participate in the Four Corners story on Monday as the story brief was to humanise those hidden from view, to allow my students to tell their own stories in their own words.</p> <p>And this is what Four Corners did. Remote interviews were conducted with the students with a teacher present for each interview. We were in the studio, while the students were simultaneously filmed on Nauru as we communicated via speaker phone. The students were not \u201ccoached\u201d beforehand, not even provided with questions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/18/australias-refugee-policy-is-one-of-deliberate-harm-and-theres-no-claiming-we-didnt-know\">Australia's refugee policy is one of deliberate harm. And there's no claiming 'we didn\u2019t know' | Ben Doherty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Navid agreed to do the interview he messaged me: \u201cWe should have the questions before the interview\u201d. I replied: \u201cJust be yourselves. Talk about what the last three years have been like. How you feel. What you want from the future. It\u2019s more like a conversation than an interview\u201d. </p> <p>I am happy to provide screenshots of all my communications with the kids prior to the interview, relaying the same message. This is why the teachers were present, so the students would feel more comfortable and be themselves, and that they were.</p> <p>From the overwhelming response I\u2019ve received, people in Australia were amazed to see these bright, \u201cnormal\u201d young people articulating their painful experiences. The kids themselves were amazed. Shamim watched the program on a phone with all her family: mother, granny, great-granny, two uncles and great-uncle. They all cried. \u201cThey are so proud!\u201d Shamim texted. And well they should be. </p> <p>Many people on Nauru have harrowing stories to tell, but they cannot share them. Some cannot get out of bed, let alone turn up at a pre-allocated time for an interview. Some are too vulnerable and at risk to speak. Some are so medicated they cannot string a sentence together. Shamim, Navid, Hossein, Misbah and Batol bravely spoke for them all; spoke of their fears for their safety, their lost years, and uncertain futures. Many other people on Nauru, not involved in the program, have sent me effusive messages of thanks for sharing \u201ctheir\u201d story. </p> <p>But the Australian government has responded ferociously to \u201ctheir\u201d story, attacking the ABC for what it claimed was biased reporting. The government is used to controlling the narrative, writing the story and dictating the Nauru script. </p> <p>Refugees speaking for themselves is not in that script because that would give the impression that they are real people, with real hopes, suffering real pain. The Nauruan government\u2019s response was similarly dehumanising. Refugees couldn\u2019t possible think for themselves, they were coached, it claimed.</p> <p>Both governments have been able to control the public discussion over the people held on Nauru by keeping them isolated from the media through the $8,000 non-refundable application fee for Nauru media visas. This decision means the Australian government and the two media outlets with approved Nauruan visas, the Australian newspaper and A Current Affair, are the only ones free to tell stories about those on Nauru.</p> <p>The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, has portrayed detainees as illiterate and innumerate, but many of my students held degrees. He said on Tuesday that many refugees on Nauru would choose to remain there permanently to get an education for their children. Dutton has not spoken to any refugees on Nauru and I know hundreds of them, all of them desperate to leave. And as Four Corners noted, the majority of refugee and asylum seeker children on Nauru are not getting an education. </p> <p>Dutton has also accused us of doing the children a disservice by not encouraging them to accept \u201cthe package\u201d and go home. All the children featured on Four Corners are refugees which, by definition, means they cannot go home.</p> <p>The prime minister, Malcom Turnbull, stated that many of the children on Nauru are there because their parents are security risks, i.e. terrorists. Considering the majority of those children have been found to be refugees, along with their parents, that\u2019s another intentional red herring. Most of those on Nauru are there because they have fled extremist regimes. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/20/doctors-freed-to-speak-about-australias-detention-regime-after-u-turn\">Doctors freed to speak about Australia's detention regime after U-turn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then there is the economic migrant misnomer. The government itself releases the statistics on refugee status determinations so knows irrefutably that this is not the case. Quite the opposite actually, as many formerly affluent Iranian refugees were forced to flee due to political persecution because they are Christian, Arabic, gay, or opposed to Sharia law. Now they have nothing.</p> <p>There\u2019s also the claim that the RPCs are now \u201copen centres\u201d. Asylum seekers are not permitted to work, are not permitted access to money (even though they may have money stored in property, confiscated when they were detained), are not permitted smart phones, and are not permitted to take any food out of the camp. Yes they are free to come and go, but they are not free. </p> <p>Media allowed on the island have criticised the asylum seekers and refugees for protesting behind the fences when they are not confined by those fences. Protesting in public has been illegal in Nauru since a new law was passed in March 2015. Subsequently, more than 100 refugees were arrested. So yes, they can theoretically peacefully protest outside the wire, but they will be arrested.</p> <p>On Wednesday night, A Current Affair \u2013 one of two media organisations to have received a golden ticket to report on Nauru \u2013 were back busily exposing \u201cthe truth\u201d as they claimed that the Four Corners program was based on the Amnesty International report released this week. No, the program was based on the children on Nauru, supported by the accounts of people, including one member of Amnesty, who had spent much longer on Nauru than any favoured media organisation and certainly more than Dutton or Turnbull. The latter never having been to Nauru.</p> <p>So when I was approached by Four Corners to participate in a program aimed at giving a voice to the voiceless, I agreed. I agreed because I am sick of the lies that direct the prevailing narrative about those on Nauru. I agreed because I know if they are not resettled somewhere safe soon, more people will die from hopelessness. </p> <p>I also agreed because I thought that if the Australian people could just see these kids, hear their voices, they would care about them too, care enough to save their lives.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Tracey Donehue is an ESL teacher who worked at the Nauru Regional Processing Centre from 2014 to 2015.</em></p> <blockquote> <p><a href=\"mailto:donehuetracey@gmail.com\"><br></a></p> </blockquote>",

  "<p>UK immigration laws permitting refugees to be deported if they exhibit \u201cextremist behaviour\u201d may breach a United Nations convention, the organisation\u2019s general assembly is to be told.</p> <p>In a speech condemning states for exploiting security fears to frustrate their international legal obligation to provide safe havens, the UN official responsible for reporting on counter-terrorism, Ben Emmerson QC, will criticise the UK\u2019s record.</p> <p>Emmerson, who recently left his post as counsel to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, has been the<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Terrorism/Pages/SRTerrorismIndex.aspx)\"> UN\u2019s special rapporteur on \u201cprotecting human rights while countering terrorism</a>\u201d since 2011.</p> <p>\u201cThe link between displacement of people from their homes and risks to national security in the countries in which they seek refuge has been irresponsibly and misleadingly overblown in many states, with the refugee crisis being used to stoke public fears of terrorism,\u201d he is due to tell the UN session on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cThere is almost no evidence that terrorist groups take advantage of refugee flows to carry out acts of terrorism, or that refugees are somehow more prone to radicalisation than others. These claims are analytically and statistically unfounded.\u201d</p> <p>Following the Islamic State-inspired attacks on Paris last autumn there were widespread reports that some of the gunmen had infiltrated refugee groups travelling through Greek islands. Those reports have since been thrown into doubt amid uncertainty over the black market trade in fake passports.</p> <p>Referring to legislative measures designed to single out suspected radicals from the refugee population, Emmerson says: \u201cThe United Kingdom, as just one example here, has enacted legislation allowing for the review and revocation of refugee status if a person is thought to have exhibited extremist behaviour, or if their dependents have acted in a manner inconsistent with British values. </p> <p>\u201cLegislation of this kind, with the vagaries that are necessarily entailed in such generalised definitions, runs a risk of falling short of the requirements of the 1951 refugee convention.\u201d</p> <p>His reference is to a Home Office report, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/493918/revocation_of_refugee_status_v4_0_EXT.pdf\">Asylum Policy Instruction: Revocation of Refugee Status</a>, published earlier this year. It states: \u201cExtremist behaviour: where there is any evidence that a refugee or their dependents have engaged in unacceptable behaviours (whether in the UK or abroad) considered not conducive to the public good or has acted in a way which undermines British values, their status must be reviewed [and referred to the special cases unit ].\u201d</p> <p>It also notes that: \u201cAlthough there is no requirement to formally respond to representations from [the UN high commissioner for refugees] caseworkers must take their comments into account as part of the decision on whether to proceed with revocation and provide UNHCR with a copy of the final decision.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere in his speech, Emmerson says: \u201cAlmost without exception, refugees and migrants do not pose a risk \u2013 they are in fact at risk, fleeing regions where terrorist groups are most active. It is beyond question that terrorist activity, in the form of asymmetrical armed conflict, is a significant driver for internal displacement and the flight of refugees.</p> <p>\u201cMany states have introduced stricter border controls, built fences and walls to keep migrants and refugees out, engaged in push-back operations, criminalised irregular migration and abandoned pledges to accept refugees.</p> <p>\u201cAmong the measures that pose serious human rights concerns are ethnic or religious profiling, the disproportionate collection of often inaccurate biometric and other data, forced fingerprinting and, perhaps most seriously, the criminalisation of irregular migration.\u201d</p> <p>Emmerson also raises concerns about the EU/Turkey agreement, which \u201cprovides for the blanket return of all migrants crossing from Turkey into Greece\u201d. He said he was concerned about the \u201cabsence of individualised consideration and the risk of detention or ill treatment in Turkey\u201d. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Emmerson\u2019s <a href=\"www.un.org/ga/search/viewm_doc.asp?symbol=A/71/384\">report on the impact of counter-terrorism measures on the human rights of migrants and refugees</a>, which details his criticisms, is on the UN\u2019s website.</p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
  "<p>Monday night\u2019s Four Corners program about the treatment of asylum seeker children on Nauru has seen the program and the ABC attacked by both the Australian and Nauruan governments. These broad swipes \u2013 attacking the ABC as an institution rather than addressing the merits of the journalism \u2013 is an approach that only works if you\u2019ve been undermining the national broadcaster through years of culture wars.</p> <p>The entire conservative attitude towards the ABC was summed up in a single exchange last month.</p> <p>The former prime minister John Howard was doing the media rounds in mid-September to promote the ABC-produced documentary he had made about his own favourite prime minister, Sir Robert Menzies.</p> <p>On 15 September Howard spoke to Tom Switzer on Radio National\u2019s Between the Lines. Switzer, a journalist and former Liberal National party adviser, frequently explores international politics with guests from traditionally conservative outlets such as the Daily Telegraph, Fox News and the Wall Street Journal. It\u2019s an often-interesting program, a million miles away from the cartoonish Sean Hannity clips that have come to represent rightwing commentary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/18/abc-and-nauru-government-clash-over-four-corners-expose-of-offshore-detention\">ABC and Nauru government clash over Four Corners expos\u00e9 of offshore detention</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The interview with Howard was light and conversational, which seemed appropriate for the interview topic. (A former prime minister discussing a TV series he made about another former prime minister is not really the place to re-prosecute the Iraq invasion. Your mileage may vary.)</p> <p>Then the moment came.</p> <p>SWITZER: Menzies once said of the ABC, \u201cI have never been persona grata with the ABC, nor the ABC with me.\u201d So let\u2019s hope your experience today means you\u2019ve had a different view about the ABC.</p> <p>HOWARD: Hahaha, next question.</p> <p>A seemingly innocuous exchange, and hardly a surprise to hear someone on the right chuckle at the idea of receiving a fair go on the ABC. But the fact that we are so used to this type of offhand commentary highlights the absurdity of this particular situation.</p> <p>Let\u2019s set the scene: this was at least the third promotional interview Howard had done on the ABC that week, which included time on ABC TV\u2019s Lateline and Radio National\u2019s Drive, not including the live broadcast of Howard\u2019s National Press Club address on the legacy of Robert Menzies, all of it designed to promote Howard\u2019s three-part documentary that the ABC had itself funded. The airwaves were so dominated by commercials for the series, I could probably recreate them verbatim should the need ever arise.</p> <p>So as Howard and Switzer sat in the ABC studios promoting a Menzies puff piece that had been made on the ABC dime, they chuckled at the unspoken but clearly understood premise that the ABC is a hive of leftwing Trotskyites, working overtime to keep the conservative message down. Caricaturists need not apply.</p> <p>This view is one that is profoundly unshakable, no matter what the evidence actually shows. In a 2009 research paper, How Partisan Is the Press?, the economists Joshua Gans and Andrew Leigh (now a federal Labor MP) discovered that the ABC\u2019s coverage slanted more significantly towards the Coalition. This study was released seven years ago but it is a revelation that has never managed to take hold in the public mind, failing to challenge accepted wisdom. The message certainly didn\u2019t make its way to Howard.</p> <p>Meanwhile the ABC itself exists in a state of everlasting course correction. Determined to avoid the appearance of bias, it uses its flagship program Q&amp;A as a cosmetic ballast. </p> <p>The newly elected One Nation Senator Malcolm Roberts was provided with airtime so he could peddle conspiracy theories about global warming. When an actual scientist, Brian Cox, asked if Roberts believed the moon landing was real, Roberts took offence, viewing Cox\u2019s question as an underhanded rhetorical swipe. But Cox meant the question: if global warming is a gigantic global conspiracy then how much of reality do you question? If that\u2019s how far we need to go to establish a baseline of sanity then something is seriously wrong.</p> <p>In 2014, when he was communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull announced a $254m funding cut to the ABC over five years. This year $20m was cut from reporting and digital services. Journalists have been made redundant and the Fact Check unit was shut down. The ABC is being chipped away, bit by bit, and every joke about its inherent, ingrained bias makes it easier to justify.</p> <p>Much of the disdain for the ABC stems from a deeper ideology, one that is rooted in the free market and sees the concept of a public broadcaster as barely indistinguishable from state propaganda, even if the state itself keeps objecting to it. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9e6ee6f94505f8828b20c7a771c165bc9cc04ccd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e6ee6f94505f8828b20c7a771c165bc9cc04ccd/0_0_1456_2231/653.png\" alt=\"Book cover - Double Dissolution: Heartbreak and Chaos on the Campaign Trail by Lee Zachariah\" width=\"653\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Zachariah\u2019s book Double Dissolution.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Echo Publishing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In an environment saturated by privately owned news outlets, justifying a taxpayer-funded news organisation seems like an impossible needle to thread. And yet one glance across the environment of broadcast journalism and the value of a broadcaster focused on the public interest becomes immediately apparent.</p> <p>Attacking the journalism conducted by Four Corners is hardly new territory. The program regularly produces stories that affect the national conversation and even policy: a shocking report on live baiting in greyhound racing led to major reforms to the industry; a story on child abuse in youth detention had the prime minister immediately calling for a royal commission; footage of live cattle exports led to an immediate, albeit temporary, ban on the practice. </p> <p>At a time when the ABC is fighting for its survival it has refused to shy away from difficult and provocative journalism that often upsets the very hands that control its purse strings.</p> <p>The problem is that no accord can be reached. There is no incentive for the ABC\u2019s critics to concede any ground on its ideological makeup: there will never be a time where they confess that, yes, the ABC\u2019s reporting typically bends in every direction to find the impossible moment of balance. They will never admit that its analysis can be seen as right-leaning just as often as it is seen as left-leaning. There is absolutely nothing to be won in such a confession.</p> <p>So long as this belief continues, the ABC will inevitably and self-consciously shift itself to the right. It\u2019s a win-win for conservatives. Like a boa constrictor tightening around its prey, it\u2019s a game of inches that will only ever move in one direction.</p> <p><em>Lee Zachariah is the author of a new book, <a href=\"http://www.echopublishing.com.au/titles/double-dissolution/\">Double Dissolution: Heartbreak and Chaos on the Campaign Trail, which is available now.</a> </em></p>",

They were a great bunch of lads, it was a tremendous achievement what we did but I think the standard has just gone up and up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ad1afa44444ba66904aba0953c6fe8626670fa0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ad1afa44444ba66904aba0953c6fe8626670fa0/0_243_3148_1889/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Merrick Muscat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Merrick celebrates Victory\u2019s grand final win over Adelaide in 2009 with Kevin Muscat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Cianflone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the non-Australian club, for the Phoenix it\u2019s often a case of \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d. Their successes are marked as aberrations, their struggles almost expected. It\u2019s a context of low-expectation that irks the veteran coach.<br></p> <p>When Merrick secured Wellington\u2019s equal best finish, fourth in 2014-15 in his second season at the club, the media plaudits focused on the standout season of Nathan Burns, rather than the team structure surrounding him, or in fact that under Merrick Burns was a player reborn.</p> <p>More than a fluke, this run to the finals was informed by the same basic philosophy that guided Merrick\u2019s all-conquering Victory side; trade Allsopp and Thompson for Burns and Roy Krishna, Fred for Roly Bonevacia or Michael McGlinchey, and Muscat for Albert Riera. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/mar/17/a-league-tactics-wellington-phoenix-danger-zones\">The cattle were different, but the attacking philosophy remained the same.</a></p> <p>And yet, for all Merrick\u2019s experience, there\u2019s no refuting that last season was a horror-show for the Phoenix, an almost perfect-storm of calamity that flustered the usually unflappable Scot.</p> <p>\u201cLast season, everything seemed to go wrong from the start, really,\u201d Merrick says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have training facilities for a lot of the pre-season, so we were training on a cricket pitch. We had the licence [speculation] over our heads. I signed Jeffrey Sarpong, who\u2019d lost the motivation to play the game \u2013 that was a big mistake.\u201d</p> <p>Merrick, pauses, and shakes his head: \u201cI\u2019m giving you excuses, I never give excuses. It was just one of those years. If there was an injury to be had, we had it, suspension to be had, we had them. For me one of the biggest killers though was our schedule \u2013 from round four to round 17 we had three games at Westpac \u2026 we hardly trained, we were just getting on planes all the time.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a reality that will always trouble the Phoenix \u2013 not too many clubs travel 5,250km (and back) for a domestic league game as Wellington did last weekend. But with their heightened focus on conditioning and sport science, off the field you get the inkling Merrick\u2019s staff is learning its lessons.</p> <p>Having seen the club\u2019s ups and downs over a decade, foundation player Vince Lia is well placed to judge the impact of the Phoenix\u2019s new coach; his old coach at Melbourne Victory. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty fickle business if you look at coaching careers and who\u2019s stayed and who\u2019s gone \u2013 it\u2019s not a great industry to be involved in but Ernie\u2019s stood the test of time,\u201d Lia says.</p> <p>It\u2019s a relationship of respect that cuts two ways, and is instructive of Merrick\u2019s man management, and the culture he tries to instil at his clubs. \u201cHe is one of those coaches that signs men,\u201d Lia explains. \u201cHe likes to sign characters, and see how they can fit into the team.\u201d</p> <p>At the Victory in season two, a wealth of midfield options saw Merrick make the call to release Lia. With just a handful of games to his name and his professional future on the line the defensive midfielder could have drifted from the A-League like so many fringe players before him.</p> <p>Instead, Merrick placed a call to friend and then Wellington coach, Ricky Herbert. He\u2019s a good lad, a good character, he\u2019ll do a job for you, was the message.</p> <p>177 A-League games later Lia never forgets the loyalty shown to him, by a coach in whose plans he no longer featured. Reunited, in turn this season Merrick has every confidence the player who\u2019s career he helped rescue will play a key role in his side.</p> <p>The successful knitting of youth with experience is a hallmark of Merrick sides \u2013 no coach has blooded more youth internationals or given chances to National Premier League players than the Scot. But if last season\u2019s injuries led to an over-reliance on green youngsters, veteran Lia is confident of the squad\u2019s depth for this campaign.</p> <p>\u201cLooking back at last year\u2019s squad you always thought if we had a few injuries, we\u2019d struggle, and it\u2019s exactly what happened,\u201d he says. \u201cWe lost Siggy [Ben Sigmund], we lost Roy [Krishna], we lost Dura [Andrew Durante] for parts of the season and we couldn\u2019t cope.</p> <p>\u201cLast season when we lost Roy, they started to double up on Roly and he struggled to have an impact \u2013 but this season, how do you double up on five players?\u201d</p> <p>The recruitment of key duo Kosta Barbarouses and Gui Finkler may have made the Australian football media take notice, but more ominously than big name signings, Merrick\u2019s trusted attacking system appears to once again have all the component parts it needs to fire.</p> <p>\u201c[Last season] was horrendous in many respects,\u201d says Merrick. \u201cBut it will make our team stronger. If we learn the lesson than we are pushing for the top four, end of story. It will be a disaster if we don\u2019t make the finals this year.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfa90a66048023db727c6b55cc6f3b22e885c4d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfa90a66048023db727c6b55cc6f3b22e885c4d8/0_83_3512_2108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wellington\u2019s Andrew Durante\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wellington\u2019s season has not got off a smooth start with two defeats, including one in Perth last weekend, from two games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Mcdonough/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only once during our interview does Merrick interrupt. Shifting uncomfortably in his chair, in his thick Scottish drawl he interjects: \u201cAch, don\u2019t talk about me, let\u2019s talk about football.\u201d</p> <p>We don\u2019t delve into his past. His background growing up in a large carnival family, this spirit of wandering that took him from Scottish town to town and in his early 20s to the outskirts of Melbourne. But as the interview continues fleeting moments in this journey are revealed.</p> <p>\u201cI arrived in Australia in 1975 and after one week I knew I wasn\u2019t going back to Europe, to Scotland \u2013 and that weather. I remember my mate picking me up and driving me from the airport, and I thought \u2018what are these big posts, do they play rugby here?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThey were different posts and I had no idea what Australian rules football was. I said \u2018there\u2019s two big ones and two wee ones\u2019 and my mate says \u2018the wee ones are for encouragement.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>As a trained PE teacher Merrick had a love for many sports \u2013 a fact that later became a strength in his coaching of football.</p> <p>\u201cGrowing up, I liked all sports, I really enjoy playing basketball, volleyball \u2013 every sport. But everybody played football in Scotland, we played it in the streets, we played it in the schoolyard every minute we got, I just loved it.\u201d</p> <p>Watching \u201cwee\u201d Willie Henderson, and later Billy Bremner or Joe Jordan, the passion for the game so intrinsic to Scottish culture infected the younger Merrick, and the other sports fell by the wayside.</p> <p>\u201cFootball was <em>the</em> game, and we used to qualify for the World Cup \u2013 it was just great to see us beat England every year, until we got banned for hooliganism. Scotland was pretty good at that too.\u201d</p> <p>After an undistinguished playing career \u2013 \u201cI was pretty rubbish\u201d Merrick reports \u2013 the Scot began his badges during the 1970s while playing in Melbourne\u2019s suburban south east.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to get on the field as the assistant coach at Doveton soccer club, and show all my fellow coaches how much I knew. I was just showing off, just trying to tell \u2018em everything I knew, and the best thing about Doveton soccer club is there was no plastic people, so they just put me in my place.\u201d</p> <p>Chastened, Merrick got his break in the National Soccer League, first with Preston Makedonia and then with Sunshine George Cross. And \u201chaving made every mistake you can make in coaching\u201d by the early 90s Merrick figured his time in the game was up.</p> <p>\u201cAfter I was sacked from my second NSL club I imagined I\u2019d never be involved in football again. I thought \u2018I\u2019ve had enough, I\u2019ll go and do something else\u2019 \u2013 until the Victorian Institute of Sport came along; and that changed my view of everything.\u201d</p> <p>Juggling full-time employment as a PE teacher with a part-time role at the VIS, for the first time Merrick saw a pathway towards being a professional football coach.</p> <p>With his interests in other sports \u2013 at one stage Merrick even undertook an AFL coaching course to learn how the game could inform the code he loved \u2013 the Scotsman was able to rub shoulders with some of the world\u2019s best coaches, from rugby, from AFL, from netball \u2013 anything that might expand his horizons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b2acee9310190a29facd6a29bcec07d3a3d2f9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b2acee9310190a29facd6a29bcec07d3a3d2f9d/0_0_3000_2242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Merrick\" width=\"1000\" height=\"747\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Merrick talks to his players during a Melbourne Victory training session in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Cianflone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over 13 years Merrick continued to re-imagine himself as a student of the game; willing to sit at the feet of anyone who could teach him new insights, new philosophies.</p> <p>When Merrick signed Grant Brebner for Victory in 2006 it was as much for his talents as a player, as the insights and winning mentality he\u2019d developed over five years as an apprentice at Manchester United under Alex Ferguson.</p> <p>\u201cI spoke to Grant Brebner about Alex Ferguson \u2026 and he said everybody knows him as a hard man and all the rest of it but he\u2019s a person who was very very good with the players. We as coaches, we don\u2019t really coach skills \u2013 we coach people.\u201d</p> <p>During the A-League\u2019s lengthy off-seasons Merrick continues to undergo football sabbaticals. With former Wellington goalkeeping coach Jonathan Gould now with West Bromwich Albion the \u2018Nix boss recently enjoyed a fruitful stint learning about the Premier League club\u2019s backroom operations.</p> <p>As we digress onto his recent dissertation into J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s \u201cunusual\u201d back-four tactical formation (\u201cvery attacking, yet very solid at the back\u201d) it\u2019s clear the veteran Merrick has lost no hunger for new knowledge, new insights.</p> <p>Despite his longevity in the game, there\u2019s no hint of tiredness in Merrick. In fact, after last season\u2019s disappointment you get the lingering feeling the 63-year-old still has a point to prove.</p> <p>\u201cThe scary thought is, I haven\u2019t peaked yet,\u201d Merrick laughs softly. \u201cAfter 30 years, I still feel I\u2019m getting better.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump raised new questions about whether he would accept the election result on Thursday, less than 12 hours after he used the final presidential debate to declare that he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-presidential-debate-election-result\">keep the country \u201cin suspense\u201d</a> over whether he would accept the outcome.</p> <p>At a rally in Delaware, Ohio, the Republican candidate said first: \u201cI will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election,\u201d before pausing for effect and then adding to cheers and applause: \u201cIf I win.\u201d </p> <p>Later he told the crowd: \u201cOf course I would accept a clear election result, but I would reserve my right to contend or file a legal challenge, in the case of a questionable result.\u201d He did not define what he meant by a clear result. </p> <p>Trump later went on to warn that his opponent Hillary Clinton would \u201cdo anything, including voter fraud\u201d to win. And he claimed that in being asked to accept the integrity of the American electoral process, \u201cI am being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters.\u201d </p> <p>Trump\u2019s refusal to endorse the results of the forthcoming election, unheard of in modern American history, ensured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-refuse-concede-election-electoral-college\">the main talking point</a> after the debate was whether the brash businessman had a suitable temperament for the White House.<br></p> <p>It also prompted a collective cringe from many in the Republican political establishment, which is now facing the prospect of losing control of the Senate and even the House because of the drag faced by down-ballot candidates campaigning into the headwinds of their presidential nominee.</p> <p>\u201cTalking about rigged elections with zero evidence is dangerous because it erodes trust without justification and kindles cynicism that undermines self-government,\u201d Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who is not up for election but is an ardent critic of Trump, said in a statement. \u201cOur elections must have integrity, even if the two major party candidates do not.\u201d</p> <p>Senator John McCain of Arizona, who lost to Barack Obama in 2008, said: \u201cI didn\u2019t like the outcome of the 2008 election.

The Trump supporter had heard about it on talk radio earlier on Thursday morning but could not remember more details.</p> <p>It is unclear what the impression will be on the wider electorate.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Nigel Fleming, a 47-year-old musician who stood on the corner of a casino-lined stretch of Fremont Street, upon hearing about Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the outcome of the election. \u201cWhy would he say that? Does he think he\u2019s lost already?\u201d</p>",

Harriet\u2019s life is hard but it\u2019s hers, thanks very much.

Her first role post-Steve McQueen\u2019s 12 Years a Slave, after all, was a play written by a university friend about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/14/eclipsed-review-lupita-nyongo-searing-war-drama\">Liberian war</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that rulebook.

Just change in all ways, it\u2019s the before-and-after moment.\u201d In the six-month run-up to the event, Nyong\u2019o is said to have walked 66 red carpets; the elegant embodiment of style and grace, uniformly written up as fierce and flawless.</p> <p>\u201cIt was actually quite scary and discombobulating,\u201d she says slowly, loosening up her shoulders.

It was very jarring. The one thing that made it all manageable was my intimate relationships because they have been constant.

She and her younger brother (who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/07/oscars-selfie-most-retweeted-ever\">photobombed that Oscar selfie</a>, still the most shared image in history, and whom she called \u201cmy best friend\u201d in her acceptance speech) seemed to take it all in their stride: meeting Beyonc\u00e9 \u201cin the Boom Boom Room\u201d, namechecked by Jay Z on We Made It, dinner with the Obamas, that sort of thing.</p> <p>How differently might she have coped if she had been in her early 20s? She lets out a big sigh and rolls back on the sofa. \u201cOh, God, I don\u2019t even want to know. I still have friends who tease me about the same things they used to tease me about before. I am eternally grateful for that, this happened at a time when I knew who my day ones were.\u201d</p> <p>Nyong\u2019o comes from a lifetime of privilege, and there has always been public interest in her family back in Kenya. She was born in Mexico because her parents were political exiles; her father is now a senator and secretary general of the Kenyan opposition party Orange Democratic Movement, and her mother worked as an editor and is now managing director of the Africa Cancer Foundation.</p> <p>\u201cMy confidence comes from my upbringing,\u201d Nyong\u2019o says. \u201cMy parents took time to instil a lot of values \u2013 patience, striving for excellence, not to compromise. Playing Harriet definitely taught me to appreciate the role a mother plays \u2013 that is a no-joke role. I spent a lot of time apologising to my mother for the unnecessary heartache I put her through.\u201d</p> <p>Such as?</p> <p>She cringes and her voice becomes softer with embarrassment. \u201cI mean, kids are so entitled. So selfish! When you realise motherhood is a part of yourself running amok in the world, and you cannot help but worry your heart \u2026 \u201d She takes a sip of water and swerves from confessing any stories about rebelling. Instead, she talks about her mother\u2019s determination to make her feel beautiful when, during her adolescence, her self-loathing had made her begin \u201cto enjoy the seduction of inadequacy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d54d5f8751c36bbb02ecd5b90b463897cdf1f0a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d54d5f8751c36bbb02ecd5b90b463897cdf1f0a3/40_0_1120_672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maz Kanata character in Star Wars, played by Nyong\u2019o\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maz Kanata character in Star Wars, played by Nyong\u2019o.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is difficult to imagine now; Nyong\u2019o, who looks as if she could have been sculpted by Rodin and has a lucrative contract as the face of Lanc\u00f4me, knows her worth.

  "<p>Theresa May has dismissed the suggestion that foreign students should not be counted as immigrants, after the chancellor, Philip Hammond, suggested that such a move could be in line with public opinion.</p> <p>Downing Street said it was not looking at whether to remove foreign students from official migration figures, despite earlier appearing to say this would be part of an overall review of the system.</p> <p>It comes after reports of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/17/philip-hammonds-brexit-worries-point-to-cabinet-tensions\">distance between No 10 and No 11</a> on a number of issues, from the approach to Brexit to May\u2019s comments about monetary policy in the most recent Queen\u2019s speech.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Hammond <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/19/philip-hammond-attempts-to-ease-concerns-over-hard-brexit\">told the Treasury select committee</a> there were \u201cconversations within government about the most appropriate way to record and address net migration\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAs we approach the challenge of getting net migration figures down, it is in my view essential that we look at how we do this in a way that protects the vital interests of our economy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is true that student visas have been abused in the past. The previous home secretary did sterling work tightening up on bogus educational institutions.\u201d</p> <p>When asked if students should be counted among immigrant numbers, he said: \u201cMy view is, this is a question of public perception and the public\u2019s view. Clearly, immigration and the level of net migration is an issue of concern.</p> <p>\u201cThe question we should be asking is, \u2018What does the public understand should be included within that definition?\u2019. It\u2019s not whether politicians think one thing or another, it\u2019s whether the public believe it.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the committee, highlighted research showing that one-fifth of people thought students counted as immigrants and 59% were opposed to efforts to reduce their numbers, prompting Hammond to respond: \u201cI think that\u2019s very interesting information.\u201d</p> <p>However, a No 10 spokesman said on Thursday: \u201cThe government objective is to reduce annual net migration to the tens of thousands, and in order to deliver this we are keeping all visa routes under review. </p> <p>\u201cOur position on who is included in the figures has not changed and we are categorically not reviewing whether or not students are included.\u201d<br></p> <p>Asked whether May had changed her mind, her deputy official spokesman said: \u201cThe issue of migration, migrant numbers, who enters the country and under what terms, is very much subject for review as we go through the process of exiting the European Union.\u201d</p> <p>The prime minister has long stuck to the position that foreign students should be included in the figures showing overall net migration numbers, fighting off an attempt to take them out under the previous Conservative government.</p>",

Surrounding this folly, first made in 1963, hang stretched hammocks of thin, coloured fabric, appended with reels of cotton. The audience can use these to stitch drawings and designs on to the lengths of material.<br></p> <p>More lengths of fabric \u2013 with stories printed, sewn and painted on to them \u2013 line the walls. Here is Emily Bront\u00eb, there is an invented myth of a virgin-eating crocodile. Delicate, touching and wan, Medalla\u2019s art is as hard to grasp as the soapsuds climbing and falling next door, where a long poem called The Bubble Machine is also pinned to the wall. The poem itself is a delightful, painful spume of reminiscence.</p> <p>What has reading a poem, or soapsuds, or an invitation to sew, or a series of images and stories, got to do with sculpture? In the poem, James Dean licks popcorn from a young Medalla\u2019s face. Further on, the young artist visits a brewery in Edinburgh, watching the froth bubbling in copper vats. And he remembers (or is it all an invention \u2013 Medalla was three when the second world war ended) a young man who was in the same Filipino resistance cell as the artist\u2019s father, fighting the Japanese, lying shot and dying, \u201ctiny bubbles coming out of his mouth/ tiny rainbows / mixed with blood\u201d. The poem makes you look at Medalla\u2019s work differently. His art is a casual affair, but it is impossible for me not to be touched by it, even though it often looks like nothing much. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"369e863320ea90cf63e6295a4383d29ec8493f7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/369e863320ea90cf63e6295a4383d29ec8493f7a/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scree Stage by Phyllida Barlow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scree Stage by Phyllida Barlow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beyond, a large gallery is almost entirely filled by <a href=\"http://www.hauserwirth.com/artists/50/phyllida-barlow/images-clips/\">Phyllida Barlow</a>\u2019s untitled: <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesartcenter.org/exhibitions/pbarlow-scree\">Scree Stage, a work first shown in Des Moines, Iowa, in 2013</a>. It is like entering a cave, a crypt, or a petrified forest. Rough concrete pillars, festooned with dangling lumps and excrescences, support a kind of slanting stage of roughly painted boards, that look like a version of the shattered ice-floes in Caspar David Friedrich\u2019s 1824 German Romantic painting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/feb/26/art\">The Sea of Ice</a>. The pillars pierce the avalanching boards, rising up like standing stones and set about with boulders and rough wedges. I thought of the neolithic formations of Carnac in Brittany and the stones of Avebury. It was hard not to laugh out loud at Barlow\u2019s mad ambition. </p> <p>Of course it is all a thing of chickenwire, scrim and concrete; hardboard, paint and tar. If it collapsed, it would kill you in a great whumphing thud. Like a cartoonish stage set, Barlow\u2019s work is a magnificent, slapstick catastrophe. High above our heads, in a far corner of the gallery, hangs a tangle of black tubing, a sort of hysterical thought bubble. While diagonally opposite, in another corner, painted boards (like estate agent signs) climb the walls. Next year, Barlow is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/04/phyllida-barlowrepresent-britain-2017-venice-biennale-sculptor-british-pavilion\">official artist in the British Pavilion</a> at the Venice Biennale.

Her <a href=\"http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/helen-marten-drunk-brown-house\">Drunk Brown House</a> also currently fills the Sackler Gallery at the Serpentine. It is difficult not to see those two exhibits, as well as her work here, as one continuous, interchangeable body of work. There are so many smaller and larger elements \u2013 things made, found, adapted, conjoined, fabricated, aligned, superimposed, ordered and arranged \u2013 that piercing the logic becomes an overwhelming task. \u201cI love the process of dragging legibility into crisis,\u201d Marten has said, \u201cand getting to the kernel of something where you know it but cannot name it.\u201d She defamiliarises the things around us \u2013 surely one of the jobs of all art \u2013 and the associations proliferate.</p> <p>In her Turner prize work, there is a small body, as if lain on a bier. Here, a similarly sorry-looking, doll-like figure is lain across something that looks like a bath for a child. The body is pierced, as if by an arrow. It is a stalk of corn. Another more diagrammatic body lies across a work mounted on the wall. The room she has at the Hepworth is divided by a sort of screen that is also a drawing made from bent, bolted-together strips of grey-painted steel. It describes a sort of flailing shirt. One sleeve looks like an erect penis. </p> <p>Marten\u2019s art is excessive, with too many details to count or describe, too many crafted bits of leather, wood and hand-embroidered fabric, inlaid Formica and woven straw, wicker, feathers, beads, shells and gum-wrappers; the real and the fabricated; drooping fag-ends and drawings of cats. In the Serpentine catalogue, Marten provides a partial lexicon of her art \u2013 from Archeology to Dust, Curves to Falling Stones. None of it helps. Instead, it compounds what is already a vertiginous complexity. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7f8844b74f679a7124c55581f92b8969b9f6b99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7f8844b74f679a7124c55581f92b8969b9f6b99/848_410_3140_1884/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stochastic Conveyor (Transference), Like Shooting Sparrows in the Dark 3 (deterrent lure) and Pernicious Membrane by Steven Claydon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Fake wood and arcane ideas\u2019 \u2026 sculptures by Steven Claydon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The logic of <a href=\"http://www.sadiecoles.com/artists/claydon#sc-exhibition-2016-the-gilded-bough-img\">Steven Claydon</a>\u2019s work is equally arcane. You enter through doorways hung with thick yellow plastic, like entrances to an abattoir or some kind of protected environment. The yellow attracts insects, while the citronella-impregnated plastic is meant to kill them. It is a trap. Six blue industrial lights glow on one wall, the kind that might be installed in some inner-city fast-food restaurant toilets to prevents junkies from finding a vein. The light reflects off a blue wall spangled with stars, except the stars are constellations of copper pennies. A huge carved tree-trunk sits on a trestle of boxes. The wood is fake, made from polystyrene foam, and so are the spoon-like sculptures from Papua New Guinea that sit on the wooden beam. </p> <p>Elsewhere, two cast busts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/03/how-william-morris-beauty-and-anarchy-uk\">William Morris</a> rest on a rusted metal and glass table. Shredded \u00a310 notes are embedded in the glass, lit from below. A microphone, connected to a sheet of suspended steel, is angled over the mouth of one of the busts. So far, it has failed to pick up any sound, but if you bash the metal sheet, a thunderous roar bursts from under the table. Claydon\u2019s art \u2013 like Marten\u2019s \u2013 sucks you down a rabbit hole. You go from mobile phone masts disguised as trees to hollow talking heads, pennies from heaven to rafts of homeless tribal artefacts. If things could speak, all you would hear is thunder.</p> <p>Art needs more interpretations than it does explanations. None of these artists make puzzles to be solved. Understanding is frequently overrated. What a rich, varied and contrary exhibition this is. After a bit, I forgot it was a prize. Here, the best art and the best sculpture might not be synonymous. It is impossible. Give the prize to Medalla, who probably needs it most. </p> <p>\u2022 The winner of the Hepworth sculpture prize will be announced on 17 November.

  "<p>Lunar House is a brutal 20-storey office block in Croydon, named after the lunar landing of Apollo 11.

The first day he waited 12 hours. It was so horrible he remembers the date: 3 March 2006. The next day he waited from 8am to midnight. Mostly, he waited outside. \u201cI was brought up with stories of Britain and its respect for human rights. But I am sorry to say that during those early days I was robbed of my dignity.\u201d There were no waiting facilities, no baby changing and nowhere to get a cup of coffee. Lunar House security guards nicknamed the entrance the \u201ccattle shed\u201d.</p> <p>That was before a couple of nuns in a Winnebago turned up outside and started collecting people\u2019s stories and distributing coffee. The security guards felt a bit uncomfortable strong-arming the nuns to leave. So they got a meeting with the head of Lunar House to discuss how immigrants were being treated there. This was the founding campaign of <a href=\"http://www.citizensuk.org/south_london\" title=\"\">South London Citizens UK</a>. One woman, a parishioner from the local Roman Catholic church, Sri Lanka-born Mary Aprigas, drove the campaign for a half-decent waiting area.

And others from local churches and further afield have been working behind the scenes. We came together early on Monday morning, encouraged by the presence of the former archbishop of Canterbury, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/17/rowan-williams-stop-foot-dragging-over-calais-child-refugees\" title=\"\">Rowan Williams</a>, and the bishop of Croydon, Jonathan Clark. As we met for morning prayer, one of the students from the theological college read the story of the child Jesus&#xa0;being forced to flee his home and of how political forces conspired to murder innocent children. It all seemed horribly contemporary.</p> <p>The Home Office had asked local churches to provide a pool of criminal-records-cleared adults who could sit with the Calais children as they went through their interviews at Lunar House. The Salvation Army provided goodie bags. Church buildings nearby had been set up as welcome centres where the children could meet their families and escape the press.</p> <p>We tried. But in the end, what will be remembered most from this week is that this country greeted vulnerable children not with welcome, but with fear and derision. Apparently, some didn\u2019t look enough like children. They didn\u2019t reward our \u201cgenerosity\u201d with cherubic faces and a gratifying tear.

  "<p>I have seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/04/how-we-made-rocky-horror\">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a>, the 1975 cult classic that still plays weekly in movie houses across the world, more than I have seen any other movie. I know the lyrics to all the songs, most of the dialogue by heart, and have immersed myself in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/19/rocky-horror-picture-show-fan-rituals-fox-remake\">culture of the live performances</a>. When Fox announced it was remaking the film for television (under the clunky title <a href=\"http://www.fox.com/the-rocky-horror-picture-show\">The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let\u2019s Do the Time Warp Again</a>) I was excited that new fans would find this treasure I\u2019ve loved for decades, but also petrified that director <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KennyOrtegaBlog?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Kenny Ortega </a>(High School Musical) might destroy it. He certainly hasn\u2019t done that, but he hasn\u2019t done much to amplify or re-evaluate the campy sci-fi-tinged musical either. <br></p> <p>As always, this is the story of young square lovers Brad (Ryan McCartan) and Janet (Victoria Justice) who want to celebrate their recent engagement with their mentor turned friend Dr Scott (Ben Vereen). On the way to his house they get a flat tire and wander into the castle of Dr Frank-N-Furter (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/14/laverne-cox-orange-new-black-transgender\">Laverne Cox</a>). Along with her butler Riff Raff (Reeve Carney), maid Magenta (Christina Milian), and entertainer Columbia (Annaleigh Ashford), the self-described sweet transvestite is having a party to celebrate the birth of Rocky (Staz Nair), a musclebound mute she created for her sexual gratification. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/19/rocky-horror-picture-show-fan-rituals-fox-remake\">The fan rituals that made Rocky Horror Picture Show a cult classic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trapped in a world of fluid sexuality and total excess, Brad and Janet begin to question their devotion not only to each other but also to adhering to the social norms they previously felt were so important. </p> <p>It\u2019s that excess integral to the show\u2019s deeper meaning that is the biggest problem here. There is something about the entire production that seems a bit slight. When Brad and Janet first show up at Frank-N-Furter\u2019s castle, they\u2019re ushered not into a grand entryway, but a tiny antechamber with ceilings no higher than the average Manhattan apartment and decor that is just as cluttered. When they go into the next room to perform the signature dance, the Time Warp, it seems like they\u2019re in a high school gymnasium rather than a grand ballroom. It\u2019s hard to make a case for the intoxicating effects of decadence when it has all the transgressive charge of an extra scoop of vanilla ice cream. </p> <p>The biggest change that Ortega makes is to turn Frank\u2019s castle into a movie theater. The show opens with the song Science Fiction Double Feature, sung not by a pair of disembodied lips but by the usher (Ivy Levan) at a movie house, which is later the same cinema Brad and Janet stumble into. It seems like he wants to conflate the film and the audience watching it (which allows for some of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/19/rocky-horror-picture-show-fan-rituals-fox-remake\">the show\u2019s famous audience participation to be included in the action</a>). Ortega wants us to feel like we\u2019re all part of a collective audience watching this film but also as if we\u2019re an audience watching another audience watching a film \u2026 or maybe we\u2019re in the audience watching the film being performed in the theater. I\u2019m not sure, it\u2019s muddled and not entirely thought through.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/04/how-we-made-rocky-horror\">How we made: The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While this postmodern approach is an intellectually interesting endeavor, Ortega never really does anything with it. In fact, because the sets look a bit shabby, the costumes a bit slapdash, and the wigs (sweet Judy Garland\u2019s ghost, the wigs!) are a fright, it seems like this remake is actually created by one of those shadow casts. However, the idea isn\u2019t fully explored and the sets and costumes exist in a weird netherworld where they\u2019re not ornate enough to be as fabulous as the originals but also not quite bad enough to be campy. </p> <p>Since it\u2019s being shown on broadcast television, the show also had to be sanitized. Gone is a fair amount of the overt sexuality, the allusions to cannibalism, a sexual relationship between Riff Raff and his sister Magenta, and, saddest of all, <a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/a7/b9/00/a7b900f8326315073fab20169680abd0.jpg\">Rocky\u2019s glorious gold Speedo</a> that\u2019s so skimpy even Tom Daley would think twice about wearing it in public. Instead Rocky is wearing what appears to be lam\u00e9 basketball shorts. For shame!</p> <p>There are some other, er, rocky transitions to television, particularly cutting up scenes to allow commercial breaks. This is especially true in the finale when the floor-show set piece is robbed of its momentum. However, I was impressed that Ortega managed to shave 10 minutes off the running time (though it runs two hours with commercials) without seeming to sacrifice any of the material. All the songs and most of the major incidents are present and correct. Some tightening has been achieved by slightly upping the tempo of some of the numbers, most notably There\u2019s a Light, but this actually improves them. </p> <p>It\u2019s not as if this recreation is a total disaster. It\u2019s still a great script with great music and some of the performances are just as good, if not better than, the original. Carney and Milian as Riff Raff and Magenta (their costumes in the finale are a vast improvement over the silly originals) and McCartan and Justice as Brad and Janet are all good. Adam Lambert plays the small but key role of Eddie originated by Meatloaf and manages to deliver what should be considered the definitive version of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMRl55U0eDw\">Hot Patootie Bless My Soul</a>.</p> <p>I was nervous that Cox wouldn\u2019t have the voice to pull off Frank, but her singing is the highlight of the role. As originated by the genius <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000347/reference\">Tim Curry</a> (who plays the narrating criminologist here) Frank is a delicate blend of zaniness, menace, desire, vulnerability and sarcasm. Unfortunately Cox can\u2019t manage to get the alchemy right. She never quite gets a handle on whom she wants the character to be, and her readings of some iconic lines falter without intention. It\u2019s not that she needs to play them just like Curry, but the characterization has no consistency. </p> <p>Faithful, fast-paced, and largely entertaining, this new Rocky Horror Picture Show is neither the calamity fans like myself were fearing nor the triumph that we were all hoping for. While some of its interpretations don\u2019t quite hit the mark, it is still good enough to get first-time viewers pumped to see the original movie. They\u2019ll be doing the Time Warp again, but it will feel like the very first time.</p>",
  "<p>Ooh, it\u2019s the age-old question, isn\u2019t it? How old is OK? When are they old enough? When is it OK to say that something was justified because they didn\u2019t look like a child to you? I notice the Daily Mail this week deploying the famous hair test to determine whether or not it\u2019s OK to go there. Wait \u2013 maybe that wasn\u2019t clear and you thought I was talking about another type of hair? Guys, of course not! I\u2019m talking about hair on the upper lip. Look at that one \u2013 it\u2019s got bumfluff and it\u2019s flaunting its smile. If anything, it\u2019s us that\u2019s going to be taken advantage of. Old muggins here is going to put out for another little chancer.</p> <p>But you see the problem. Sometimes it\u2019s really difficult to know whether we\u2019re on about refugees coming to the UK, or underage children of celebrities that you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about having sexual feelings for. Or maybe not you, but whoever chose the \u201cgorgeous\u201d paparazzi picture of the 11-year-old, or wrote the \u201cleggy\u201d picture caption to accompany it. Or whoever decides that the \u201cchild\u201d in the phrase \u201cchild refugee\u201d can now only appear in print in <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3853830/How-child-migrants-straining-care-British-children-paying-price.html\">inverted commas</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2016/oct/20/kim-kardashian-doesnt-need-to-learn-a-lesson-but-the-media-seems-to\">Kim Kardashian doesn\u2019t need to learn a lesson \u2013 but the media seems to</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Occasionally, it\u2019s almost as if the Mail is deliberately trying to rip a tear in the age-appropriate continuum. Consider <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs/the_papers\">Thursday\u2019s front page</a>. The main headline ran: \u201cGive \u2018child migrants\u2019 age tests, says Straw.\u201d And right next to it was a picture of Cindy Crawford and her 15-year-old daughter, with an exhortation to \u201cspot the difference\u201d. Well, now you\u2019re asking. I used to be sure it was something about one of them being a child, but I\u2019m starting to lose my bearings. Also: can I give Cindy\u2019s daughter an age test? She looks \u201colder\u201d. Say what you like about political correctness, it will never take our inverted commas from us.</p> <p>Even so, whenever they\u2019re talking about individuals of indeterminate age \u2013 be it refugees or hot minors \u2013 I always find it helpful to think of the Mail as engaged in a dangerously perverse take on George Carlin\u2019s famous routine about words you can\u2019t say on TV. \u201cI can prick my finger,\u201d he mused. \u201cBut I can\u2019t finger my prick.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, Lost in Showbiz would like to stress that it\u2019s not just the Mail that\u2019s a bit \u201cconfused\u201d about age. When Adam Johnson was found guilty of sexual activity with a 15-year-old this year, the Sun lost no time in denouncing the \u201cpervert footballer\u201d, despite having run pictures of Cindy\u2019s Crawford\u2019s aforementioned daughter during the trial, in which readers were invited to enjoy her \u201cshapely pins\u201d. She was 14 at the time.</p> <p>Still, maybe the paper knew something we didn\u2019t. Maybe it was using the same <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/19/how-oldnet-no-real-indicator-of-age-says-microsoft-amid-child-refugee-row\">two-bit age-recognition software</a> on which the Mail seem to be nosing its entire coverage of the child-refugee issue. It\u2019s not to everyone\u2019s taste, it must be said. I notice Gary Lineker has taken a lot of stick for appearing repulsed by the Mail\u2019s angle \u2013 and he will doubtless take a lot more from the paper itself before it is <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3852104/Gary-Lineker-sparks-Twitter-row-blasting-utterly-heartless-treatment-child-migrants-arriving-Calais.html\">done with him</a>. In case you missed this \u2013 Gary reacted to the front page querying the ages of some of the refugees leaving the Calais camp for the UK with a tweet reading: \u201cThe treatment by some towards these young refugees is hideously racist and utterly heartless. What\u2019s happening to our country?\u201d</p> <p>How unforgivable that Gary should have failed to understand the Mail\u2019s byzantine etiquette around the issue of age. He can\u2019t say it hasn\u2019t given him special insights. In fact, it wasn\u2019t all that long ago that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarinaHyde/status/400194749732102144\">I saw a Mail headline</a> inquiring suggestively: \u201cSo who\u2019s the younger lady, Gaz?\u201d over a picture of Gary with his \u201cpretty stepdaughter\u201d, who at the time was 11.</p> <p>At least she was older than Heidi Klum\u2019s daughter, described as a \u201cleggy beauty\u201d, who \u201cshowed off her best model walk through the parking lot\u201d after a paparazzo caught her coming out of gym class. She was eight.</p> <p>In some ways, though, it is through the prism of fathers and daughters that we can gain the most insight into the tabloid view of age. A year ago, I was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/11/alexander-carter-silk-charlotte-proudman-trump-father-daughter\">deeply moved</a> by a rather angsty column written by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/oct/19/kelvin-mackenzie-entitled-to-attack-fatima-manji-over-hijab-says-ipso\">Sun\u2019s former editor Kelvin MacKenzie</a>, shortly after Jos\u00e9 Mourinho had attended an award ceremony with his daughter wearing a dress that seemed to have aroused Kelvin. Aroused him to anger, I should stress. Although I suspect what Kelvin was really saying was that he found the picture appealing \u2013 certainly he must have, at some level, to have embarked on such a lengthy deflection mission. \u201cIf I were Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, I wouldn\u2019t be impressed with my 18-year-old daughter,\u201d he fretted. \u201cSurely, no father would enjoy seeing his daughter wear so little.\u201d I bet Donald Trump would. But if Kelvin prefers an answer closer to home, what about Sam Fox\u2019s dad, whose permission he sought to print topless pictures of her when she was 16?</p> <p>Making Kelvin sound like a moral philosopher, meanwhile, is Tory MP David Davies (not the Brexit secretary \u2013 the other one). By chance, I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/14/marmite-royal-yacht-britain-global-joke-news\">wrote about David last week</a>, when he made some sally in the Great Brexit Marmite wars. This week, he pops up again, declaring from a couple of photos of the Calais refugees that they \u201cdon\u2019t look like children\u201d, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/child-refugees-dental-tests-verify-age-david-davies\">demanding they be subjected to dental tests</a>.</p> <p>Back then to that question: when is it OK to justify something with the observation that they \u201cdon\u2019t look like children\u201d? I\u2019m just feeling my way on this. If you are a Tory MP, and about to deploy the phrase \u201cThey don\u2019t look like a child\u201d, you need to first ask yourself an important question. Are you looking at pictures of a) a little minx in a miniskirt, or b) someone who has fled a war zone and has been living in a tented migrant camp for months or even years? If it\u2019s a), then it\u2019s not OK, because times have moved on and we\u2019re all a little more enlightened about which bits of our mind palaces we can open to the public. But if it\u2019s b), it\u2019s still totally fine to say it out loud.</p> <p>David\u2019s such a headline-seeking brainiac that I half expect him to roll out this plan to the Premier League, and demand that the big clubs fund in-nightclub dental screening to guarantee the age of the females the players might want to do it with later. Or maybe the bars could install booths fitted with the shonky age-guessing software the Mail are using?</p> <p>Failing that, maybe someone could invent some software through which kid-related newspaper copy could be fed, in order to determine whether it\u2019s \u201cbravely saying the things that ought to be said\u201d or \u201cobviously fucking gross\u201d. Consider this exhibit from a Sun article \u2013 featuring all! the! shocking! photos! \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/reallife/893664/ocean-4-sunbathes-with-me-i-dont-like-fake-tans/\">about a child beauty pageant</a>: \u201cCAVORTING provocatively in a tiny pink swimsuit and clutching a cuddly stuffed kitten, little Ocean Orrey struts her stuff in a British beauty pageant \u2013 aged just FOUR.\u201d</p> <p>So, as we play out, readers, remember: it\u2019s <em>never</em> OK to share pictures of four-year-olds and say they\u2019re \u201ccavorting provocatively\u201d \u2013 unless you\u2019re a national newspaper. I mean that seriously. I think you can literally be arrested for it.</p>",

The reputation of business has been tarnished as a result of this greed. The vast majority of businesses are not run and managed like this.

He took the rings from BHS\u2019s fingers, beat it black and blue, starved it of food and water, put it on life support, and then wanted credit for keeping it alive.</p> <p>BHS\u2019s balance sheet was made considerably weaker during Sir Philip\u2019s tenure of the company. His extraction of value early on in his ownership made the company less able to innovate, to retain a market share or competitive place in the retail market which would allow the firm to generate the profits and be in more of a position to survive and to address the growing pension scheme deficit. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Wright said the BHS Group\u2019s dividend policy \u201cset the scene for the eventual demise of the company\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BHS folded in 2016, a year after Sir Philip Green sold it to Dominic Chappell, but its demise was on the cards a lot earlier than that. In the three year period between 2002 and 2004, BHS Group paid dividends of \u00a3423 million, even though operating profit for the period was less than that amount, at \u00a3325 million. In 2004, BHS Group had dividends of \u00a3199,500,000. This dividend exceeded the Group\u2019s operating profit for that year of \u00a3137 million ...</p> <p>Sir Philip could say, quite reasonably, that he received dividends for only a short period of time early on in his period of ownership. It was a long time ago. That is true. But I do think the dividend policy is crucial to understanding the whole story of BHS and wider lessons for business. </p> <p>Green was to enrich himself, his family and his friends at the expense of long-term and sustainable growth for the company. Certainly, profits were made, but they were more akin to a short-term sugar boost rather than a nutritious diet that aided the long term health and strength of the busines<strong>s. </strong></p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Wright said Green was not even very good at retail.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sir Philip received his knighthood for services to retail. However, throughout the course of our inquiry, it became increasingly evident that he wasn\u2019t particularly good at retail at all. True, he was able, in the early days, of sniffing out a corporate bargain and cutting costs to boost profit. There is nothing wrong with that, but he did not boost BHS\u2019s turnover during his period of ownership, he lost market share to more nimble, or even not-so-nimble competitors, and he failed to anticipate the on-line retail revolution. By failing to innovate and invest in the brand, BHS looked like a remnant of the 1970s and 1980s, in a cut throat competitive sector where grabbing the customer\u2019s attention and retaining their loyalty are paramount.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5808b936e4b055209adaf893\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T12:32:22.059Z\">1.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>James says it is important that the investigating bodies are given time to complete their inquiries.</p> <p>If the evidence supports it, enforcement will be taken, she says.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5808b837e4b005f21833b70f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T12:31:22.742Z\">1.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>James says Green says he is in a dialogue with the pensions regulator.</p> <p>She says she would urge him to sort it out quickly.</p> <p>The pensions regulator continues to investigate the handling of BHS pensions.

Here it is.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Rolf Harris</strong>, March 2015. The former children\u2019s entertainer was stripped of his CBE after being jailed for almost six years for a string of sex attacks on girls as young as seven. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong> Stuart Hall</strong>, October 2013. The former It\u2019s A Knockout presenter was made an OBE in 2012 for services to broadcasting and charity. But the Queen directed it be cancelled after Hall, then 83, was handed a 30-month jail term for sexually abusing 13 victims, one as young as nine, over a period of nearly 20 years. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Vicky Pryce,</strong> July 2013. The economist was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 2009 in recognition of her contribution as head of the Government economic service. But in March 2013 she and ex-husband Chris Huhne were both jailed for eight months for swapping speeding penalty points a decade earlier so he could avoid a driving ban, which only emerged when Pryce approached newspapers after Huhne left her for another woman. She was released from prison after two months but, following her conviction, her name was removed from the Order of the Bath register. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>James Crosby,</strong> June 2013. The former HBOS chief executive, who was knighted in 2006 after leaving the bank, was stripped of the title at his own request following a scathing parliamentary report into its collapse. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Jimmy Savile,</strong> January 2013. The television star was knighted for his services to charity in 1990 but the honours forfeiture committee considered stripping him of the title posthumously when the scale of the paedophile\u2019s crimes emerged. The Cabinet Office later said that he had ceased to be a member of the order upon his death in 2011. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Fred Goodwin</strong>, January 2012. Goodwin received his knighthood for services to banking under the Labour government before guiding the Royal Bank of Scotland to the brink of collapse in 2008. While honours are usually only removed from those convicted or jailed, the Cabinet Office said the scale of the RBS disaster - necessitating a \u00a345bn bailout from the taxpayer - made the case \u201cexceptional\u201d. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Jean Else</strong>, February 2011. \u201cSuperhead\u201d Jean Else was made a Dame in 2001 in recognition of her transforming performance at Whalley Range High School in Manchester. But in January 2009 she was banned from running a school after the General Teaching Council found her guilty of failing to observe minimum standards in recruiting and promoting staff. Her honour was revoked in 2011 after she was found guilty of misconduct. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Robert Mugabe</strong>, 2008. Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe was stripped of his honorary knighthood in 2008 over his \u201cabuse of human rights\u201d and \u201cabject disregard\u201d for democracy. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>\u201cPrince\u201d Naseem Hamed,</strong> 2007. The former WBA world featherweight champion was jailed in 2006 for 15 months and disqualified from driving for four years after a crash in May 2005 that left another man with fractures to \u201cevery major bone in his body\u201d. The boxer was stripped of his MBE in January 2007. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Lester Piggott</strong>, 1988.The former champion jockey was stripped of his OBE after he was given a three-year jail term for evading tax in 1987. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Anthony Blunt,</strong> 1979. Art historian Anthony Blunt was a Professor of the History of Art at the University of London and Surveyor of the Queen\u2019s Pictures. What was not known was that in 1964 he had confessed to having been a member of the infamous Cambridge Five Soviet spy ring, passing information to Moscow while they worked for MI5 during the Second World War. His secret was closely guarded for many years, but Margaret Thatcher publicly revealed his status in November 1979 and he was immediately stripped of his knighthood.</li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5808aec6e4b055209adaf856\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T11:47:58.677Z\">12.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Eleanor Laing,</strong> the deputy speaker, says she expects the debate to end around 2.30pm.

Witnesses appeared to harbour the misconception that they could be absolved from responsibility by blaming others. The worst example was Sir Philip Green, despite his protestations to the contrary. Sir Philip adopted a scattergun approach, liberally firing blame to all angles except his own, though he began his evidence by saying he would do the opposite. The truth is that a large proportion of those who have got rich or richer off the back of BHS are to blame. Sir Philip Green, Dominic Chappell and their respective directors, advisers and hangers-on are all culpable. The tragedy is that those who have lost out are the ordinary employees and pensioners. This is the unacceptable face of capitalism.</p> <p>The sale of BHS did not have to proceed as it did. The potential checks, however, proved to be inadequate. Regulatory concerns were circumvented. Advisers were heavily incentivised to progress the deal ...</p> <p>Sir Philip Green drove the deal forward. He sought to sell a chain that had become a financial millstone and threatened his reputation. He knew that Dominic Chappell was a wholly unsuitable purchaser but overlooked or made good each of Chappell\u2019s shortcomings and proceeded with a rushed sale regardless.</p> <p>Dominic Chappell was out of his depth. He was over-optimistic to the point of arrogance. He failed to recruit a retail expertdespite his own lack of experience; failed to secure funding on commercial terms; failed to address BHS\u2019s property leases in a timely way; and failed to address the company\u2019s long-term underperformance ...</p> <p>The Green family benefited significantly from BHS. In his early years of ownership, Sir Philip cut costs, sold assets and paid substantial dividends offshore to the ultimate benefit of his wife. He failed, however, to invest sufficiently in stores or reinvent the business to beat the prevailing high street competition. We found little evidence to support the reputation for retail business acumen for which he received his knighthood.</p> <p>It is true these are private companies holding Green family money. BHS, however, was a major employer and the sponsor of a large and ailing pension fund. Arcadia, another Green company, is in a similar position. Sir Philip gave insufficient priority to the BHS pension scheme over an extended period. His failure to resolve its problems by now has contributed substantially to the demise of BHS. Sir Philip owes it to the BHS pensioners to find a resolution urgently. This will undoubtedly require him to make a large financial contribution. He has a moral duty to act, a duty which he acknowledges. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5808aa25e4b005f21833b6bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T11:32:25.146Z\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fuller says Green was running a business with 11,000 employees.

Davis implied the government was looking at such an option. He told her:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are seeking to ensure a smooth and orderly exit from the European Union and it would not be in the interests of either side, either Britain or the EU, to see disruption. And to that end we are examining all possible options, as you would expect.</p> <p>We are approaching these negotiations in good faith and with goodwill towards our negotiating partners, and we hope the same in reverse, focused on a mutual interest to the UK and the EU including financial stability. I would say that having London as a number one financial centre sitting at the heart of the global capital markets is not just in the UK\u2019s interests, it\u2019s also in the EU\u2019s interests, and I\u2019m confident that everyone will see the value in not undermining it. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Hilary Benn</strong>, the Labour MP and new chair of the shadow Brexit secretary, said that businesses needed to know now that transitional arrangements would be put in place if there was no deal within two year. Davis told him:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have to treat as absolutely central to what we do maintaining the stability of both the City but also the European financial markets, and the European financial markets are a little fragile over the last few years. Now we will therefore do anything necessary. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Davis said that the government would publish \u201cmuch information\u201d about its Brexit plans between now and the triggering of article 50, starting the two-year EU withdrawal process.</strong> He told MPs:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the course of the coming - whether it is six months or less - period before the triggering of article 50, much information will be put out about this and the House will be in no doubt what our aims and strategic objectives are.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>But he also claimed that Labour was undermining the national interest by demanding detailed information about the government\u2019s Brexit negotiating position. </strong>He told MPs:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m afraid what [Labour] do is rather seriously not to the country\u2019s interests from time to time ...</p> <p>What the opposition are trying to do is to put us in a disadvantaged position against the European Union.

It seems highly likely that the Commons will vote for Sir Philip Green to be stripped of his knighthood.</p> <p>MPs are due to debate a motion on <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmworpen/54/5402.htm\">the joint report from the Commons business committee and the Commons work and pensions committee into the collapse of BHS.</a> It says Green should fulfil his promise to make good the deficit in the BHS pension fund. But more than 100 MPs have signed an amendment tabled by the Conservative MP Richard Fuller saying Green should lose his knighthood. It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[This House] noting that Philip Green received his knighthood for his services for the retail industry, believes his actions raise the question of whether he should be allowed to continue to be a holder of the honour and calls on the honours forfeiture committee to recommend his knighthood be cancelled and annulled.</p> </blockquote> <p>It would be surprising if John Bercow, the Speaker, does not call the amendment and, assuming it does get called, it is hard to imagine it not being passed. It is not binding, because the final decision on Green\u2019s knighthood would be taken by the honours forfeiture committee, but the committee may find it hard to ignore parliament.</p> <p>I will be covering the debate in detail.</p> <p>Otherwise it is a relatively quiet day.

  "<p>A retired academic raided by armed police after Interpol tipped them off that she had illegally imported a \u201ceuthanasia kit\u201d took her own life a few days later, an inquest has ruled.</p> <p>The coroner said that Prof Avril Henry, 81, a member of the pro-euthanasia group Exit International, died at a \u201ctime and place she decided herself\u201d. </p> <p>Coroner John Tomalin said Henry was a \u201clady who knew her own mind, a bright, intelligent retired professor\u201d. He added: \u201cShe suffered a number of painful and debilitating conditions which there were no cure for.\u201d</p> <p>The full details of the police raid were not given in court but it is understood that she surrendered some of the drugs in her kit after officers forced their way into her home \u2013 but kept half without officers realising.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/21/academic-kills-herself-after-importing-euthanasia-kit-illegally\">Police were called back</a> to her cottage in the village of Brampford Speke in Devon a few days later and Henry, who was a professor of English medieval culture at the University of Exeter until 2000, was discovered dead in her bath.</p> <p>At the time of her death in April, the Australian euthanasia campaigner Prof Philip Nitschke, who founded Exit International, said Henry was furious at the intervention by Devon and Cornwall police, accused the force of being heavy-handed and said Exit International was warning other members of what had happened. </p> <p>The inquest in Exeter was told that Henry had \u201ca number of painful and debilitating conditions\u201d including arthritis, spinal pain, incontinence, cardiac failure, chronic deafness, sleep problems, asthma and swollen feet.</p> <p>Her GP, Dr Stephen Vercoe, said she first mentioned euthanasia in November 2013 when she told him: \u201cLife is not really worth living any more.\u201d </p> <p>She told other health workers that she wanted to go to Dignitas in Switzerland to end her life but they told her it was illegal for them to help her \u2013 which she accepted. </p> <p>Vercoe said: \u201cMyself and several other medical professionals were well aware of Prof Henry\u2019s intention but we all felt she had mental capacity, was not sectionable and there was no further action we could take.\u201d </p> <p>She ordered drugs from Mexico on the internet but police were tipped off and raided her home. However, this did not stop her taking her life a few days later. In a note she said her death had been \u201claboriously planned\u201d and described the law that prevents people being helped to take their own lives as \u201cillogical\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d.</p> <p>Henry said she did not believe there needed to be a postmortem examination and asked that her body be buried in her orchard. A postmortem examination found Henry\u2019s death was caused by the drugs she had taken.</p> <p>Of the raid, William Michelmore, her solicitor, told the inquest: \u201cTwo armed police officers smashed a glass panel in Avril\u2019s door and came into her house. She was very upset by the infringement on her personal space by the police forcing their way in.\u201d </p> <p>She instructed Michelmore to lodge a complaint with Devon and Cornwall police. The coroner said: \u201cDr Henry appeared to start considering ending her life before she became too unwell. This goes back to November 2013, when she first spoke to her GP about this.</p> <p>\u201cIn fact, she made no secret of her intentions and was assessed by her GP and psychiatrist on more than one occasion. The medical profession all concluded that she wasn\u2019t depressed, she had full mental capacity to make decisions about when and how she would end her life.</p> <p>\u201cThe evidence to me is quite clear. Dr Henry set about a course of action that was intended to end her life at a method, a time and place that she decided herself.\u201d </p> <p>In April when Henry died, Nitschke said: \u201cPolice need to realise that in the UK suicide is not a crime, and mental health authorities need to recognise that not everyone who seeks to end their life is in need of psychiatric intervention.</p> <p>\u201cHer death was a clear case of \u2018rational suicide\u2019 and her decision to die at her own time and in her own place should have been respected. As it is the authorities did everything they could to make her last days on this earth a misery.\u201d</p> <p>After the inquest Nitschke told the Guardian there were about five more police raids around the UK following that on Henry\u2019s house. </p> <p>He said: \u201cThe pattern was always the same \u2013 local police visiting at night asking to come in for a talk as they \u2018were concerned about the person\u2019s wellbeing\u2019. Generally they were let in, at which point they said they had information \u2018from Interpol\u2019 that they had imported the euthanasia drug and that they should hand it over. </p> <p>\u201cThe information was always correct. Generally the drugs were handed over and they were asked about their involvement with Exit.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe effect on our membership was dramatic. Lots of anxious people wondering where the breach in security had come from. In retrospect it looks as though it was the email communication with a particular Mexican supplier. This supplier now uses email encryption.</p> <p>\u201cMy best guess is that these bouts of enthusiastic activity are designed to \u2018send a message\u2019 to Exit\u2019s elderly membership to stop seeking internet euthanasia drugs. If this is the case it\u2019s been remarkably successful.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Exit International is a not-for-profit Australian company that says it has an online membership of 18,000 supporters around the world.</p> <p>It says the average age of Exit members is 75 years.

  "<p>Tove Lo is not having a good day. This morning, after a night of karaoke in Seattle with Maroon 5, she had a phone interview with a fellow Swede. She very nearly hung up on him. \u201cHe was so condescending,\u201d she says, exasperated. \u201cBy the end of it I was just like, \u2018You know what? You obviously have a very set image of what you think of me, so let\u2019s just end this.\u2019 He was like, \u2018OK, I didn\u2019t get much time anyway \u2026\u2019 No, because you fucking don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p> <p>When we meet in a secluded corner of the Ace hotel in Portland, ahead of her performance in the city tonight, Lo is still reeling from the encounter. What frustrated her the most, she says, is that he had arrived clutching so tightly to his own misconceptions. \u201cI just know he\u2019s gonna angle this into me not being a serious artist. I was thinking all the time, \u2018You would fucking not be this way if you were talking to a man right now.\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJoYp7WGBuU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WJoYp7WGBuU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Three years after her self-released single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh2LWWORoiM\">Habits (Stay High)</a> exploded, Lo has become all too familiar with condescension. With lyrics both wryly funny and desperately bleak, the song documented her flailing, substance-fuelled attempts to numb the pain of a break-up. \u201cYou\u2019re gone and I gotta stay high all the time,\u201d she sang in the song\u2019s chorus, \u201cto keep you off my mind.\u201d With a precision that only Robyn has mastered with quite such delicacy, Habits was a heartbreak song you could dance to. And yet the conversation around it, and the singles that followed, seemed to focus on two things: the sex and the drugs.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s one line about that, and then there\u2019s 14 other songs that I wrote,\u201d she says of the song\u2019s opening lyric: \u201cI eat my dinner in my bathtub, then I go to sex clubs.\u201d</p> <p>She had no idea that her candidness would provoke such a strong reaction, nor that her debut album, Queen of the Clouds, would do the same. Sure, its overt sexuality was playfully on the nose at times \u2013 \u201cIf you love me right, we fuck for life,\u201d she sings in Talking Body \u2013 but, she insists, she\u2019s hardly in uncharted waters. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard that in music since I don\u2019t know when. I just feel for me, sex and music have always been very connected. Being open about being a woman, and being open about sex, is not a bad thing. And the other thing is like, would they ever ask a guy this? Ever?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3e4bb896f13a321679d3cff484b1e88d1d7a4ced\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e4bb896f13a321679d3cff484b1e88d1d7a4ced/0_0_2480_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lo\u2019s second album.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lo\u2019s second album.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI feel like I grew up in a place where nudity and sex is something natural and not shameful.

All of a sudden, I\u2019m fighting this fight I didn\u2019t know I needed to fight.\u201d</p> <p>Not that Lo has taken this as reason to tone things down on her new album, Lady Wood, with its winking title and the accompanying artwork \u2013 a closeup of her hand pulling down on her own shorts, the Os of Tove Lo shaped like vaginas. It was inspired by <a href=\"http://wwwrollingstones.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/03/sticky.jpg\">the Rolling Stones\u2019 Sticky Fingers cover</a>, though the Swedish interviewer from this morning, to Lo\u2019s chagrin, assumed she was copying <a href=\"http://www.slantmagazine.com/assets/music/13360/likeaprayer.jpg\">Madonna</a>.</p> <p>Thematically, the album treads similar ground to its predecessor, but with a self-referential smirk on its face. On the title track, whose minimalist clicks and sparse, elastic beats vaguely resemble modern dancehall, she sings, \u201cI know what people say about you, they say the same about me,\u201d a nod to the reputation she has garnered. Flashes, a darker take on the effect her increased fame and attention has had on those around her, points out that when she \u201cfucks things up\u201d a camera flashes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsFneCExrCQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XsFneCExrCQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The seeds for the album\u2019s infectious lead single, Cool Girl, came from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaoQNDIf6pY\">the monologue Rosamund Pike\u2019s character Amy makes in Gone Girl</a>. Dripping with sarcasm, the song lambasts the faux-breeziness that people \u2013 particularly women \u2013 are expected to project at the start of a relationship. \u201cNo, let\u2019s not put a label on it / Let\u2019s keep it fun,\u201d she insists, tongue-in-cheek, teeth gritted, \u201cI\u2019m a cool girl, I\u2019m a, I\u2019m a cool girl / Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy.\u201d She has been on both sides of it \u2013 the one trying too hard not to show her hand, and the one unwittingly hurting the other person. Both, she believes, could be avoided if people were less guarded with their feelings. \u201cI feel like emotion is seen as a bad thing, where it should be the opposite. We just live like this, making ourselves smaller, to not bother each other. You\u2019re not supposed to be too loud, and [there are] all these rules about how your emotional state should be, and it\u2019s just \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really make sense.

So unguarded is her presence that it\u2019s easy to forget this is a professional encounter.

  "<h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lucia-graves\">Lucia Graves</a>: \u2018Hillary Clinton spoke directly to women\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b72cb7920bd461392b581c8560214d184520edf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b72cb7920bd461392b581c8560214d184520edf7/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Lucia Graves\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>On Wednesday night, in the last presidential debate of what has been an emotional tornado of a campaign, Hillary Clinton spoke directly to women.</p> <p>It began with a commitment to upholding the values laid out in Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion in the United States. Clinton spoke of protecting healthcare centers like Planned Parenthood that make upholding those values possible.</p> <p>Trump proceeded to make a fool of himself: \u201cIf you go with what Hillary is saying,\u201d he began, \u201c ... you can take baby and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/abortion-trump-clinton-debate\">rip the baby out of the womb</a> in the ninth month, on the final day. That\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s also not true. Late term abortions are extremely rare, and Trump\u2019s insistence that a baby can be torn out of its mother moments before childbirth is pure malarkey. Roe v Wade is meant to protect women\u2019s right to abortion up until \u201cfetal viability\u201d, which in Planned Parenthood v Casey, in 1992, was defined as 23 or 24 weeks or earlier. More recently fights in Congress have centered around an abortion ban at 20 weeks \u2013 in other words nowhere near the ninth month.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s obliviousness to these facts underscores his lack of understanding of the abortion debate and women\u2019s issues generally, a trait that was on display earlier this year when he suggested women who have abortions should face \u201csome sort of punishment\u201d. That\u2019s something no one on either side of the aisle wants, and tonight made clear Trump hasn\u2019t done any homework since his earlier blunder. </p> <p>But the evening was also a referendum on Trump\u2019s personal treatment of women. At one point, Clinton more or less said so. \u201cDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a woman anywhere who doesn\u2019t know what that feels like.\u201d</p> <p>And unlike his infinite malleability on policy issues, misogyny is the one philosophy Trump clearly hasn\u2019t changed and seems genuinely unable to. He bristled when Clinton recalled his referring to former Miss Universe Alicia Machado as an \u201ceating machine\u201d, but soon after, he was interrupting to call Clinton not just the usual \u201cliar\u201d, which has by now become banal, but \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/nasty-woman-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">such a nasty woman</a>\u201d, an even more baseless character attack.</p> <p>I\u2019ve spent the election writing about the women who\u2019ve known Trump. But this isn\u2019t just about the women I interviewed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">Machado</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/sheena-monnin-donald-trump-miss-usa-lawsuit\">Sheena Monnin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\">Jill Harth</a>.

But she also fumbled needlessly, at one point answering a question about Syria by saying the US must work with \u201cAmerican Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks,\u201d then awkwardly following up with a non-sequitur: \u201cThe killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born.\u201d</p> <p>The night was devoid of poetry, and ended as depressingly as the entire campaign has been conducted.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamie-weinstein\">Jamie Weinstein</a>: \u2018The only question is whether he now faces a Mitt Romney-style disaster or a Michael Dukakis-style catastrophe\u2019<br></h2> <p>Donald Trump needed a devastating knockout.

The only question that remains is whether Donald Trump faces a Mitt Romney-style disaster or a Michael Dukakis-style catastrophe \u2013 and, in that loss, whether Trump brings the Republican House, Senate, party and even conservative movement down with him.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/christopher-r-barron\">Christopher R Barron</a>: \u2018Trump stuck to the issues and forced Hillary to talk policy\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d07b62588db36e5f2f2ad87ddc32e036d46f0263\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d07b62588db36e5f2f2ad87ddc32e036d46f0263/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Christopher Barron\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump came to this behind in the polls and reeling after weeks of negative media coverage.

For far too long, the Republican candidate has let the campaign be about the circus and not about policy. If this race is about the circus then Hillary Clinton wins.

  "<p>Good things come to those who wait, the well-known Guinness slogan once claimed. </p> <p>But that is unlikely to apply <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/16/harder-brexit-worse-for-ireland-sterling-fall\">in the case of a hard Brexit</a>, which would likely stop the black stuff flowing freely across the Irish north-south border, and result in lines of Guinness lorries queuing in both directions.</p> <p>\u201cAn impact on the border will be an impact on the heartbeat of the economy,\u201d said Oliver Loomes, the Ireland country director for the drinks giant Diageo, which produces two of the world\u2019s best known drinks brands, Guinness and Bailey\u2019s Irish Cream.</p> <p>The company\u2019s operations on the island vividly illustrate how interlinked the two economies have become.</p> <p>\u201cWe operate on an all-island basis. I think we have one of the most integrated operations of any business in Ireland,\u201d said Loomes, who is responsible for the company\u2019s operations on the island of Ireland and not simply the Irish Republic.</p> <p>He estimates that there are about 13,000 border crossings a year by Diageo trucks. The introduction of a hard border could delay each truck by between 30 minutes and an hour, making each journey \u20ac100 more expensive. That alone would cost \u20ac1.3m.</p> <p>Diageo is one of Ireland\u2019s largest food and drink exporters, producing beer and cream liqueur at four sites, two in the Republic and two in Northern Ireland. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8198a3ecffd15f8ffcba59e0558a4082a911a898\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8198a3ecffd15f8ffcba59e0558a4082a911a898/1174_788_3730_2238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guinness and Bailey\u2019s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guinness and Bailey\u2019s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Leigh/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most famous is at St James\u2019s Gate in Dublin, the home of Guinness, and there is a Bailey\u2019s plant in Dublin. In Northern Ireland, there is a packaging plant in Belfast for the beer business and a Bailey\u2019s manufacturing plant at Mallusk near Belfast.</p> <p>Materials used in manufacturing both products are in constant movement between the plants and across the border. For instance, Guinness brewed in Dublin is canned in Belfast and then sent back to Dublin to be exported around the world.</p> <p>\u201cSt James\u2019s Gate brewery accounts for about 35% of our global beer production but 70% of that production, 1.2bn pints per annum, is exported out of Ireland to more than 130 markets across the world,\u201d said Loomes.</p> <p>\u201cWe make 6m cases of cream liqueurs between the Dublin site and the Northern Ireland site and more than 90% of that 6m cases is exported. All of those operations in beer and cream liqueurs in value terms you are talking of more than a \u20ac1bn out of Ireland.\u201d</p> <p>A crucial aspect of this massive operation is that all raw materials and ingredients are produced in Ireland. \u201cWe would purchase goods and materials that go into making beer and liqueurs to the tune of about \u20ac270m per annum. So we are one of the largest purchasers of high quality agri ingredients in the Irish economy.\u201d</p> <p>Guinness buys about 140,000 tonnes of barley, or about 14% of the national crop, every year. Bailey\u2019s involves the purchase of 275m litres of milk to go into the creation of the cream liqueur. The milk comes from 40,000 cows on 1,500 Irish farms and accounts for nearly 5% of total milk production in the Republic.</p> <p>The milk and the whiskey from various locations south of the border goes north to the Bailey\u2019s production facility in Mallusk and then to Dublin for export around the world. The glass and packaging also come from both sides of the border.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1ecc9c069d247fdca379e79a7d166708dcde67f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ecc9c069d247fdca379e79a7d166708dcde67f8/0_248_4064_2438/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Guinness brewery in Dublin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guinness brewery in Dublin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as employing 1,200 people directly, Loomes estimates that Diageo\u2019s purchase of goods and materials support 19,000 jobs in the wider agri and service economy, while its purchases of milk and barley provide livelihoods for around 6,000 farm families.</p> <p>As well as the economic impact Loomes expressed concern at the impact the reinstatement of a hard border might have on society, given the hugely positive impact of the peace process over two decades.</p> <p>\u201cDiageo is a great example in Ireland of how the impact in terms of free movement of goods and services across the border would impact negatively on our business and also therefore on the wider economy and the wider communities.\u201d </p> <p>He is adamant that having that free movement on the island is a key driver of economic growth for Diageo and for the wider economy.</p> <p>\u201cWe would be highly supportive of the efforts of the Irish government, the Northern Ireland administration and the Northern Ireland secretary are placing on retaining the free movement of goods and services.

We are bringing to life little-known individuals of the past, putting a spotlight on the diversity of those working today, and showing that far from being isolated and struggling, women have always collaborated and created networks of their own.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with a quiet giant of early 20th century archaeology, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Garrod\">Dorothy Garrod</a>. She worked on a huge number of sites through her career, and became <a href=\"http://trowelblazers.com/dorothy-garrod/\">the first woman professor in any field at Oxbridge</a>. In 1929, less than a year after women got the vote in the UK, Garrod directed an excavation at Mount Carmel with an international all-female team. Charming one-off story? Nope - also in 1929, <a href=\"http://trowelblazers.tumblr.com/post/62730801575/gertrude-caton-thompson-society-girl-suffragist-and\">Gertrude Caton Thompson</a>, a friend of Garrod, dug Great Zimbabwe with two young women as assistants. One was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Kenyon\">Kathleen Kenyon</a>, who became one of the most influential archaeologists in Britain (and a Dame besides). Look back further to the turn of the century, and Caton Thompson\u2019s teacher, Egyptologist <a href=\"http://trowelblazers.com/margaret-murray-the-marvellous-mud-marching-mummy-unwrapping-margaret-murray/\">Margaret Murray</a>, was also excavating with other women.

Yet in the 21st century we\u2019re starting to see a push back, with women advancing across different specialisms and career stages.<br><br>The Raising Horizons exhibition is about celebrating this heritage, and showcasing the contemporary face of the geosciences. We\u2019ve chosen 14 women working today, ranging from field leaders, to those at early career stages but still experts in their areas.</p> <p>Marie Carmichael Stopes (yes, she of the family planning clinics) was a pioneering early 20th century expert in ancient plants; unable to go with Sir Robert Scott to source fossils from Antarctica, she nevertheless studied those he collected. Her counterpart Dr Jane Francis is the Director of the British Antarctic Survey, and has actually been to the frozen continent; she\u2019s even worked on the same deposits as Marie.<br><br>Professor Nicky Milner of the University of York works on one the most important post-Ice Age site in Europe: Star Carr, in Yorkshire. Her research is redefining our understanding of this period, just as Dorothy Garrod did for near Eastern cultures of a similar age.</p> <p>Jacquetta Hawkes spent a lifetime mixing archaeology with history, art, and film; the author of visionary literature (A Land), she was a multimedia master of science communication. In the 21st century, Dr Colleen Morgan\u2019s career has already explored the fuzzy edges between archaeology and contemporary cultural media such as photographic practice, and she worked on the re-creation of a Neolithic village inside the hugely popular MMORPG Second Life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8b19a9f9734513fd0dc8aa06e963c47eed542d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8b19a9f9734513fd0dc8aa06e963c47eed542d7/0_0_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tori Herridge and Chris Church shooting the crowdfunding film at the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology.

He has even set up a website where his supporters can sign up to be a \u201cTrump Election Observer\u201d. </p> <p>The suggestion has alarmed civil rights advocates, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-s-poll-watching-talk-spurs-call-international-monitors-n636136\">raising concerns</a> of voter intimidation and racial bias at the polls this November. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe <a href=\"http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/usa/246356\">aims to send </a>500 international observers to monitor the US elections, a 10-fold increase from 2012. </p> <p>With the possibility of more monitors in polling places than ever before, here\u2019s a look at what to expect when voters arrive on 8 November. </p> <h2>What are poll monitors?</h2> <p>The job of poll monitors, also known as poll observers, poll watchers and inspectors, is to ensure that the voting process runs smoothly and according to the law. This volunteer watch force is observing poll workers and voters for any possible violation of election law.</p> <p>Trump has urged his supporters to \u201cwatch and study\u201d voters at polling stations, and has launched a website encouraging supporters to sign up through his <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/landing/volunteer-to-be-a-trump-election-observer\">Trump Election Observer</a> program. However, in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/policies-for-election-observers.aspx#access\">at least 40 states</a>, partisan observers must be accredited or appointed. </p> <p>It\u2019s very possible that Trump\u2019s informal observers will be turned away if they haven\u2019t obtained the proper accreditation.</p> <p>Observers are typically allowed to watch the casting of ballots, testing of voting equipment and the counting of the ballots. States generally specify the number of partisan observers allowed at the polling place, how they are appointed and trained, when and where they are allowed to operate and what their responsibilities entail. </p> <p>Monitors are strictly prohibited from interfering with the electoral process, which includes intimidating voters, election officials and poll workers. If an issue arises, observers are allowed to alert the election officials or the authorities. </p> <p>Yet despite Trump\u2019s repeated calls for supporters to register to be poll watchers, there appears to be no real effort underway for them to do so, according to a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/19/us/politics/donald-trump-voting-election-rigging.html\">New York Times report</a> from this week. Local officials in battleground states told the Times that the numbers of people seeking to be poll watchers are \u201con par\u201d with years past. </p> <h2>What are poll workers?</h2> <p>Poll workers are civically minded recruits or volunteers who agree to give up their election day to work extremely long hours for very little pay. Because election day is on a Tuesday and is not a federal holiday, the job disproportionately attracts retirees and the marginally employed.</p> <p>Each state has a different set of laws and rules governing the selection and eligibility of a poll worker. But in general, they are eligible voters registered in the state where they are stationed. Training is typically offered or required both online and in-person, and workers in some states receive increased pay for having the extra instruction. Poll workers are not expected to be politically agnostic, but they are deployed to stations in a bipartisan manner. </p> <p>A typical day\u2019s work can be 11 or 12 hours, and includes opening and closing the polling stations, issuing ballots to registered voters, registering voters, monitoring the voting equipment or counting votes. Poll workers are typically paid for working election day and afforded a small stipend for meals and travel. </p> <p>US elections suffer from a dearth of volunteers. The shortage can result in longer lines, which can in turn depress voter turnout.</p> <h2>What are observers watching for?</h2> <p>There are several categories of observers, all of whom have different goals. The types of observers include partisan, nonpartisan, nonpartisan international and academics. Trump is specifically asking his supporters to ensure that election officials do not disadvantage his campaign. </p> <p>Nonpartisan observers are typically focused on ensuring integrity and transparency in the electoral process and should not have a stake in the outcome of the election. If carried out properly, these observers can provide useful feedback to improve election procedures going forward. </p> <p>Many poll watchers consider themselves voter rights activists,<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poll-monitors-arent-trump-thinks_us_57bcae40e4b03d51368b46b6\"> there to help prevent</a> instances of disenfranchisement \u2013 intentional and unintentional. In an essay for the Huffington Post, a poll monitor in California said instances of alleged voter fraud are incredibly rare. The most common problems watchers observe are related to a poll worker\u2019s failure to provide proficient translation or requiring a voter show ID that is not required. </p> <h2>What is voter fraud?</h2> <p>Voter fraud is committed when there is a deliberate interference with the election process. Examples of this include casting more than one ballot, voting under the name of a deceased person, casting a ballot by a felon who is not eligible to vote, registering to vote as a fictional person or someone else, impersonating another voter or manipulating the ballots by election officials. </p> <h2>Is voter fraud rampant? </h2> <p>Americans are sharply divided along mostly partisan lines about the extent to which voter fraud is committed. Conservatives have long alleged voter fraud is widespread and that preventing it is paramount to preserving the integrity of the election process. Yet critics note that many of the measures designed to reduce voter fraud and passed by Republican legislatures disproportionately impact poor and minority voters.</p> <p>Furthermore, research indicates that instances of voter fraud are relatively rare, and that claims of widespread voter fraud are greatly exaggerated. A <a href=\"http://votingrights.news21.com/interactive/election-fraud-database/\">News21 investigation</a> found just 2,068 cases of alleged election fraud between the years 2000 and 2011, when the report was published. Similarly, an investigation by Justin Levitt of the Loyola Law School found even fewer instances of voter fraud:<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/06/a-comprehensive-investigation-of-voter-impersonation-finds-31-credible-incidents-out-of-one-billion-ballots-cast/\"> just 31 \u201ccredible\u201d incidents </a>of voter impersonation out of 1bn votes cast between 2000 and 2014.</p> <p>Recent allegations of widespread voter fraud are often misrepresented. Multiple fact checks have debunked accusations of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/pennsylvania/statements/2016/aug/12/viral-image/internet-philly-rigged-2012-presidential-election-/\">voter fraud in Philadelphia</a> in 2012. The allegations stemmed from the fact that 100% of voters in 59 zones voted for Obama over Mitt Romney.</p> <p>While some saw the numbers as evidence of foul play, fact checkers deemed it wholly plausible and mathematically possible. The average number of registered voters in these small divisions within Philadelphia is 616, and the average number of registered Republicans in the divisions is 17,<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/pennsylvania/statements/2016/aug/12/viral-image/internet-philly-rigged-2012-presidential-election-/\"> according to Politifact</a>. In a 2012 lawsuit over a voter identification, lawyers for the state of Pennsylvania <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/pennsylvania-admits-it-no-voter-fraud-problem/2012/07/24/gJQAHNVt6W_blog.html?utm_term=.e9d6b05d5e06\">conceded</a> that there have been \u201cno investigations or prosecutions of in-person voter fraud in Pennsylvania\u201d. </p> <p>In addition to Philadelphia, Trump has singled out Chicago and St Louis as cities where observers should expect voter fraud. There is no evidence to support that these cities are particularly beset by voter fraud. </p>",

  "<p>Once the wreckage of the ribs has been cleared, Gucci Mane rises and patrols the perimeter of the packed private room at the Ludlow Hotel\u2019s Dirty French restaurant in New York, greeting his public. The Atlanta rapper \u2013 after being confined for four months to his home city, his house arrest has been lifted \u2013 sports a crisp white button-down and jeans, looking as if he has just taken off his suit jacket and tie to hit the dance floor at a wedding. His sunny demeanour contrasts with the poker-faced ice sculpture behind him: a bust imagining him as a blinged-out Julius Caesar, replicating the cover of his new album, Woptober.</p> <p>After a toast from his former label head, long-time manager and friend Todd Moscowitz, Gucci addresses the crowd almost shyly \u2013 and for a full 15 seconds.</p> <p>\u201cI really thank y\u2019all for having dinner with me tonight, man,\u201d he says, without raising his voice. \u201cIt was a pleasure.\u201d</p> <p>Since the release of his 2005 debut album, <a href=\"http://www.everythingbrittany.net/gucci-mane-trap-house-2005-a126235594\" title=\"\">Trap House</a>, the 36-year-old Radric Davis has been one of hip-hop\u2019s most influential and feared figures. Three or four years ago, an event with Gucci Mane\u2019s name attached would have been considered a liability \u2013 a staging ground for an altercation, or just a no-show. Before this year, the last major signpost in the rapper\u2019s career was an extended <a href=\"http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/gucci-mane-continues-twitter-war-puts-nicki-minaj-drake-and-more-on-blast-news.7173.html\" title=\"\">Twitter diatribe from September 2013</a>, in which he insulted both close friends and sworn enemies, threatened lawsuits, bragged about sexual conquests and told his former associates at Atlantic Records what to do with themselves.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6RWvkRCXOQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/g6RWvkRCXOQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>By the end of that week, Gucci was in jail. After being caught with a handgun and a bag of weed, he had acted \u201cerratically\u201d and threatened the police officers who had stopped him. He apologised for his behaviour \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve been drinking lean for 10 plus years &amp; I must admit it has destroyed me,\u201d he wrote on Twitter \u2013 but he remained in jail until his trial in August 2014, at which he was convicted and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/21/gucci-mane-sentenced-on-federal-gun-charge\" title=\"\">sentenced to 39 months in prison</a>. The following month, another conviction, for a lingering aggravated assault charge \u2013 hitting an army sergeant over the head with a bottle at a party \u2013 resulted in an additional three-year sentence. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/27/gucci-mane-released-early-from-indiana-prison\" title=\"\">He was released on 26 May this year</a>, and entered into the period of house arrest that ended on 20 September.</p> <p>\u201c[Prison] was one of the best things that ever happened to me, looking back on it,\u201d he tells me, the day before the private party, on an Astroturf-covered balcony at another New York hotel. Gucci had been in and out of county jail since he was a teenager (even facing murder charges at one point, although they were eventually dropped). But a maximum-security facility \u2013 in this case, the US penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana \u2013 was a different universe. \u201cIt\u2019s a life-changing experience, being in a place that is full of death, full of violence, full of rage, full of despair,\u201d he says solemnly. \u201cIt motivated me to change my life, because I\u2019m never going back there.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/28/gucci-mane-everybody-looking-review-trap-stars-quickfire-post-prison-set\">Gucci Mane: Everybody Looking review \u2013 trap star's quickfire post-prison set</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The man sitting next to me bears little resemblance to the Gucci of three years ago, the one captured in iPhone videos getting in fistfights at an Atlanta mall, fondling automatic weapons in short films for Vice, and facing off with James Franco in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/04/spring-breakers-review\" title=\"\">Harmony Korine\u2019s 2013 trapsploitation satire Spring Breakers</a>.

Changes such as these were all conspiracy theorists needed, after the rapper\u2019s release from prison, to assert that the real Gucci Mane had been traded in for a svelte, Game of Thrones-loving clone.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr2fObAF93Q\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nr2fObAF93Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>But talking to Gucci resurrects some mannerisms recalled from his pre-prison appearances: a slight flaring of the eyebrows and a tight drawing-together of the lips at the end of a statement to signal: \u201cI\u2019m done talking about this.\u201d In our conversation, this is reserved for any discussion of estranged associates, notably his former business partner Debra Antney and her son <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/05/waka-flocka-flame-review\" title=\"\">Waka Flocka Flame</a>, Gucci\u2019s former best friend and a trap music icon in his own right.</p> <p>\u201cPrison kind of cut a line in the sand \u2013 made a bounty with a lot of people I haven\u2019t really kept in contact with,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I got out, there was kind of no need to rekindle \u2013 we hadn\u2019t talked in three years. The prison kind of made that relationship die down \u2013 that was kind of a benefit. Everybody fell to the wayside.\u201d</p> <p>In Gucci\u2019s mind, then, the hard work of repairing old bonds \u2013 the ones that matter \u2013 is done. The future is looking bright, with new faces in his corner and a new top-five album under his belt, July\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/24/gucci-mane-everybody-looking-review\" title=\"\">Everybody Looking</a>, and a follow-up, Woptober, released on 17 October.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a225334b551bf532585c26cb5fc18e78019e2587\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a225334b551bf532585c26cb5fc18e78019e2587/0_4_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Onstage with Shawty Lo in Atlanta, Georgia, 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Onstage with Shawty Lo in Atlanta, Georgia, 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rose/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like regretting,\u201d he says. \u201cAnybody that I ever hurt, if I had the opportunity to apologise to them for doing something out the way to them, I\u2019ve already done that. I done forgave myself for a lot of things I did. So I just keep pushing forward.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a good moment to do it \u2013 the beginning of a new, wholly open-ended period in Gucci\u2019s life. Just two days earlier, he had taken to Instagram to cut off his GPS-monitored ankle bracelet, which had kept him in his pearly walled, palm-tree-studded mansion in suburban Atlanta, or at \u201cwork-related\u201d events in the metropolitan area, since May. He <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/09/22/gucci-mane-celebrates-freedom-drops-10k/\" title=\"\">celebrated by hitting a strip club in midtown Manhattan</a> with his girlfriend Keyshia Ka\u2019oir, Atlanta producer Metro Boomin, and Brooklyn rapper Fabolous. They spent roughly $10,000 in $100 bills and feasted on a triple-decker cake encrusted with 24-carat gold.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Anybody that I ever hurt, if I had the opportunity to apologise to them, I\u2019ve already done that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite the fact that the only beverages Gucci touches are coffee and water, he seemed to savour every minute of the experience. \u201cI love just going to the club and listening to music, seeing what people vibe to,\u201d he explains. \u201cI was just watching. How do people move? What\u2019s the new hot song? It was kind of like a research thing \u2013 intel. I\u2019m kind of out of the loop.\u201d</p> <p>Being on house arrest didn\u2019t cut him off entirely, though. In addition to recording and shooting music videos, he was allowed to perform at the BET awards, and at the Atlanta leg of Drake\u2019s sold-out Summer Sixteen tour \u2013 invitations that demonstrate the surprisingly warm welcome-home he has had from the hip-hop community at large. Drake \u2013 a passing target in Gucci\u2019s Twitter rant \u2013 was an early post-prison visitor, swinging by the house with a new song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0NkO7GtMQ4\" title=\"\">Back on Road</a>, all ready for Gucci\u2019s verses.</p> <p>\u201cHe ain\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Gucci says, gratefully \u2013 then, matter-of-factly: \u201cAnyone who say they ain\u2019t a fan of Drake\u2019s music is lying.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOmsxhn6F90\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pOmsxhn6F90?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>An even more unexpected gesture came from Kanye West, who emailed Gucci for a verse for the GOOD Music posse track Champions the week he got out. West returned the favour by guesting on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyeWk8J3uvs\" title=\"\">Pussy Print</a>, a particularly seedy highlight on Everybody Looking. Outkast also contacted Gucci recently about getting permission to use an old verse of his, but he has little insight as to why.</p> <p>That Gucci is making these kinds of connections shouldn\u2019t be that surprising. His swaggering and unrepentant variety of Atlanta trap music \u2013 trap refers to where drug deals are made and the difficulty of escaping the dealing life \u2013 has only cast a wider shadow since his incarceration. There is the growing influence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/12/future-rap-rock-hendrix-honest\" title=\"\">Future</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/08/young-thug-hits-bring-money-lil-wayne\" title=\"\">Young Thug</a>, two former Gucci proteges turned superstars, and the unprecedented success of crossover acts from beyond Atlanta, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/19/fetty-wap-i-didnt-even-get-to-use-no-bed\" title=\"\">Fetty Wap</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/16/travis-scott-hip-hop-critics\" title=\"\">Travi$ Scott</a>. Today, even Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9 integrate Gucciesque stop-and-start rhythmic cadences into their vocal lines, collaborating with one of his go-to producers, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbEoRnaOIbs\" title=\"\">Mike Will Made It</a>.</p> <p>While in prison, Gucci followed musical trends as best he could. Some developments surprised him: \u201cThere was a lot of reggae and Caribbean-vibe music \u2013 it\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s not really my zone.\u201d He heard some emerging trap stars he liked; soon after returning to Georgia, he sent a verse to his favourite, Florida\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_mWyjJQxWg\" title=\"\">Kodak Black</a>, for the 19-year-old rapper\u2019s Lil Big Pac mixtape. Gucci\u2019s biggest source of creative inspiration, though, was hearing the new types of beats his favourite producers were making.</p> <p>\u201cI would hear Mike Will do tracks with [Atlanta rap duo] Rae Sremmurd and be like: \u2018Damn, that hard,\u2019\u201d Gucci says. \u201cI\u2019d be writing stuff in there thinking what I would have matched to that.\u201d He scribbled down phrases on scraps of paper, and when possible, left verses as voicemails for his oldest and most trusted producer, Zaytoven; eventually, this material would become the backbone for Everybody Looking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c2529b2dd6651cb87b94d60910193cb6cda1040\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c2529b2dd6651cb87b94d60910193cb6cda1040/0_0_3000_2468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Snoop Dogg at the 2016 BET Hip Hop Awards, September 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"823\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Snoop Dogg at the 2016 BET Hip Hop Awards, September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paras Griffin/BET/Getty Images for BET</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once home, Gucci quickly established a routine based on working out two or three times a day, eating right \u2013 \u201ca lot of seafood, cut out beef and pork,\u201d he suggests \u2013 spending time with Ka\u2019oir, and logging long hours in the studio. Gucci estimates that he has recorded between 80 and 100 songs since May \u2013 he tries to knock out four or five in a session, working exclusively with in-house producers who can draft a beat within his preferred timeframe: five to 10 minutes. That productvity meant that no sooner had Woptober been released than he was able to announce yet another new album, The Return of East Atlanta Santa, to be released on 16 December.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got two studios in the house, so we\u2019ll just be bouncing back ideas. They\u2019ll get on the keyboard and I\u2019ll just start brainstorming, or matching a melody. I\u2019m just throwing out topics, and they\u2019ll be like: \u2018That was slick, what you just said.\u2019 I want it to go somewhere that I don\u2019t even know where it\u2019s gonna go. I don\u2019t like to catch the vibe of the beat you send me \u2013 let\u2019s go ahead and make it from scratch. When we look back on it, it\u2019s like two different people didn\u2019t even make it. It\u2019s more fun for me like that.\u201d</p> <p>Gucci is unclear what his next musical move will be after The Return of East Atlanta, but he doesn\u2019t seem too concerned about it. For him, the journey is more important than the destination; whatever else is true, making music feels better to him than ever before. \u201cBack when I was always high, I was numb,\u201d Gucci explains. \u201cI\u2019d go in there, and if I did good, it was still just routine. But now, I can feel it \u2013 it\u2019s exciting again, like: \u2018Damn, I crushed that shit.\u2019 Back then, you\u2019d send me a bunch of beats and it was like clockwork.\u201d</p> <p>After the dinner at Dirty French, Gucci heads to Up and Down, an upscale club in Chelsea, to perform a short set. The highlight is 2009\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wBOiO5ptJk\" title=\"\">Wasted</a>, the fratboy-slang-flipping anthem that remains the biggest hit of Gucci\u2019s career. Hearing him rap lines from a perspective so remote from his current one (\u201cRockstar lifestyle, might don\u2019t make it / Living life high, every day clique wasted\u201d) is odd and cathartic \u2013 a reminder of what an amazing, varied and contradictory career he has already had in just more than a decade. At the time of the song\u2019s release, the rapper was churning out more mixtapes than anyone could keep track of, and courting mass commercial appeal while preparing to release his new studio album, The State vs Radric Davis. But that same month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/03/gucci-mane-arrested-traffic-violations\" title=\"\">Gucci would disappear for six months on a parole violation charge</a>, breaking a momentum he would never be able to regain.</p> <p>But revisiting old music seems to revitalise Gucci, not depress him; he likes to listen to it when he works out or drives. That store of memories will likely be a helpful resource for him while putting the finishing touches on the autobiography he wrote in prison \u2013 \u201ca story of resilience,\u201d he says \u2013 that Simon &amp; Schuster is likely to publish next year.</p> <p>\u201cI never wrote anything down, so you can just hear how [the songs are] all over the place,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to look back, but it\u2019s good to reminisce \u2013 like a history book. Like: \u2018This is how I was at 26, I was wild.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to go through that no more, you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p> <p><em>Everbody Looking and Woptober are out now on Atlantic.</em></p>",

Economies that are dependent on a single city hub are less resilient to global economic shocks. A regional visa system could facilitate and promote economic development outside of London,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>Immigration has been a key part of the Brexit debate. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/government-faces-backlash-from-business-leaders-over-foreign-workers\">raised the idea of companies disclosing the proportion of foreigners they employ</a>.<br></p> <p>\u201cBy allowing the regions to control immigration this will recognise the fact that the needs of London and Yorkshire will differ dramatically. Whilst all regions will have to adhere to the same overall requirement criteria set by the Home Office they will be allowed to control the numbers of migrants and the skills they require for their region,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>It is not clear what visa regime will apply to EU workers after Brexit, but the report said that if the current visa system was applied around three-quarters of Britain\u2019s EU workforce would not meet these requirements. This could have an impact on the City of London \u2013 where 32% of the workforce is international, with 12% hailing from Europe. It would also affect healthcare, agriculture and construction.</p> <p>Australia and Canada are seen as the most relevant comparisons for a UK regional visa. The report said: \u201cBoth countries designed their systems to attract migrants to help combat problems of sparsely populated regions and declining populations. Whilst we acknowledge that a post-Brexit visa system will have different motivations, the mechanisms and lessons are relevant, as these relate to tying migration to particular area needs.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Australia uses a regional sponsored migration scheme where a three-year visa is granted for workers sponsored by employers.

Behind Ni\u00f1o\u2019s head, Dublab\u2019s motto glowed in neon letters, \u201cFUTURE ROOTS RADIO.\u201d Alejandro Cohen, the station\u2019s Argentina-born executive director, explained that the sign, and the others around the station, were gifted to them by a Dublab DJ who once interned for the guy who does all the neon for the stores in the Valley.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/03/nts-london-radio-station\">How London\u2019s NTS is helping to redefine live radio</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the best part of two decades Dublab has existed on a subfrequency of Los Angeles-born radio, one not advertised on highway billboards or emblazoned on tote bags earned with a pledge of $10 a month. It\u2019s become a haven and destination for seekers and eccentrics, an unconventional entity that might start its broadcast day with languid disco and that schedules its hyper-kinetic juke show for the early afternoon on a Tuesday. \u201cPeople usually explore music in such a limited capacity compared to what is possible,\u201d says Mark \u201cFrosty\u201d McNeill, one of Dublab\u2019s co-founders.<br></p> <p>Besides what they send out streaming into the world, Dublab has become an experiential presence in Los Angeles. The station throws its own themed events, like the ambient-focused Tonalism, and sets up club nights where they only play sad music and keep boxes of tissues on hand. The broadcast schedule is filled with an evolving roster of Los Angeles DJs and music obsessives. As McNeill says: \u201cAny night of the week, Dublab DJs are playing somewhere in the city.\u201d</p> <p>A broad swath of outsiders also seek out Dublab\u2019s curatorial talents. The High Times<em> </em>Cannabis Cup<em> </em>had them take over a stage this past summer at its event in San Bernardino, while the Los Angeles Music Center \u2013 Downtown\u2019s hub for usually staid classical music and opera \u2013 began a relationship with Dublab a little over a year ago to get them to advise on and book special events. </p> <p>McNeill started Dublab and was the station\u2019s director for its first 16 years. Now he broadly defines his role as: \u201cDJ, board member, creative consultant, project manager, spirit guide.\u201d He became interested in radio while attending the University of Southern California in the 1990s. Back in the 1970s<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>the school turned its station, KUSC, over to public radio, where it was staffed with professionals and became the region\u2019s biggest classical music station. In response, a group of students created KSCR, an unlicensed, low wattage radio station. While working at KSCR, McNeill became the station director and made the decision, progressive at the time, to schedule electronic music shows throughout the day, not just during the late night hours. More importantly, he discovered that USC had an unused Real Media server sitting in a closet, so the station began broadcasting its FM signal through the internet, a rare move for any radio station during that time.</p> <p>The Federal Communications Commissioned ended up shutting KSCR\u2019s terrestrial broadcasts, but McNeill already realized the possibilities of internet radio. He found a partner for his vision in Jon Buck, who was more interested in the business side of medium. With a financial investment from Buck\u2019s family, Dublab began broadcasting from a storefront off of Melrose Blvd that had been converted into a studio.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ecd9c2b672a23867c97466668a4726cfcf22e954\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecd9c2b672a23867c97466668a4726cfcf22e954/0_498_4826_2895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DubLab radio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DubLab radio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of DubLab</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the start, McNeill put together a cultivated roster of DJs. He brought along KSCR DJs, such as beat scene mainstay Daedelus. He picked up his favorite DJs who also had shows on local freeform FM stations like KPFK and KXLU. He scooped other talent, including Aurelito and Shakespeare, a pair that famously ran a reggae soundsystem from inside of a converted ice cream truck. In later years they brought on artists like Gaslamp Killer and Flying Lotus, whose Brainfeeder radio show on the station would come to provide the name for his own record label. Recent DJs include the ultra mellow<strong> </strong>Suzanne Kraft and Brian Shimkowitz of the Awesome Tapes from Africa imprint. This year alone has seen new shows for more established names, like Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio, Jennifer Herema of Royal Trux, and underground LA hip-hop\u2019s Cut Chemist. </p> <p>\u201cWe saw online radio as the wild west of media \u2013 a place that could be defined, could be invented, and could be made to do what we wanted to do,\u201d says Cohen, who got involved with Dublab in its early days.</p> <p>Internet radio and streaming music were still in their nascent stages, and Dublab had to develop custom software and programs to even be heard. In the beginning they were still broadcasting over a dial up modem. Taken with the interactive possibilities of this technology, they originally had an active text chat so people could communicate with the DJs and a video simulcast that up the bandwidth. A global community of listeners soon found them. \u201cFor a lot of people it was like magic, and for us it was magic that people were out there,\u201d says McNeill.</p> <p>As Dublab found its footing, in 2001 the internet bubble burst. The situation got dicey, but it managed to hang on, even as its more well funded competitors went bust. \u201cA lot of these players in the late \u201990s were throwing money at these radio stations [that were] basically not challenging the notion of what music could be online,\u201d says Daedelus. \u201cDublab was really something from a different direction, especially in those early days.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/dec/02/best-albums-of-2014-no-9-youre-dead-by-flying-lotus\">Best albums of 2014: No 9 - You're Dead! by Flying Lotus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The station moved to its current location above a nightclub on the fringes of Silver Lake, parted ways with Jon Buck and in 2008 it officially changed its status to a not-for-profit.

  "<p>A draft bill on a second independence referendum has been published by the Scottish government after the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, pledged to hold a new poll in the event of a hard Brexit in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/nicola-sturgeon-challenges-may-with-second-referendum-bill-scottish-independence-snp-conference\">direct challenge to Theresa May</a>. </p> <p>The draft legislation, which was formally unveiled by the constitution secretary, Derek Mackay, despite the Scottish parliament being in recess until next week, sets out proposals for the rules governing the campaign, the conduct of the poll and how votes are counted. </p> <p>Mackay said the proposed franchise would be the same as for the Scottish parliament. \u201cThat will mean two important groups of people would have a voice denied to them in the recent referendum on EU membership: 16- and 17-year-olds and citizens of EU countries who have made Scotland their home.\u201d</p> <p>The eight-page document proposes that any referendum would be run in a way similar to 2014, using the same yes/no question: \u201cShould Scotland be an independent country?\u201d It also suggests that the vote would similarly not be subject to any minimum turnout requirement or an approval threshold. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f9e19dd5a8006051b75e3899f652969b472716b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f9e19dd5a8006051b75e3899f652969b472716b/0_78_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sturgeon said she would put forward proposals for maintaining Scotland\u2019s position in the single market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the bill was published, Sturgeon said: \u201cWe will continue to work UK-wide to seek to avert a hard Brexit and we will also bring forward proposals that seek to protect our place in the single market, even if the rest of the UK leaves.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, if we find that our interests cannot be properly or fully protected within a UK context then independence must be one of the options open to us and the Scottish people must have the right to consider it.\u201d</p> <p>She added that any decision on holding a referendum, including the timing of it, would be for the Scottish parliament \u2013 where a pro-independence majority exists between the SNP and the Scottish Greens \u2013 to take.

We face unacceptable risks to our democratic, economic and social interests and to the right of the Scottish parliament to have its say.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed those statements contradict the assurances given before the independence referendum in 2014 that Scotland is an equal partner within the UK and that a vote against independence would secure our EU membership.\u201d</p> <p>But the Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale, described the draft bill as \u201cirresponsible economic vandalism\u201d, warning: \u201cOur economy is in trouble following David Cameron\u2019s reckless Brexit gamble, and the very last thing we need is more uncertainty for employers.\u201d</p> <p>And speaking before the publication, the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, vowed that her party would fight proposals for a second referendum \u201cevery step of the way\u201d.</p> <p>Dugdale has also written to the Scottish parliament\u2019s presiding officer, Ken Macintosh, asking for clarification over how the SNP\u2019s plans will be examined, arguing that the SNP is trying to dodge scrutiny by publishing the consultation during parliamentary recess.</p>",

In most of the Nordic countries, victims\u2019 sexual histories are not considered relevant evidence in rape cases and generally victims have the right to have their own lawyer appointed. Importantly, in Finland, Sweden and Norway, rape complainants are also extended certain procedural rights which give them a much stronger legal position in relation to the criminal justice procedure. That allows them to partly participate in the criminal justice process, as opposed to only having the status of a witness.</p> <p>However, even these countries have not cracked the code. Along with the UK they also suffer from low conviction rates and some of the same biases. Victims\u2019 medical histories can be subject to legal scrutiny, and offenders in <a href=\"http://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/overgrepp-mot-kvinnor-och-barn-den-rattsliga-hanteringen-9789139014263\" title=\"\">Sweden</a> are more likely to be convicted if their victim belongs to a higher social class. In <a href=\"http://www.dkr.dk/voldt%C3%A6gt-der-anmeldes-vi\" title=\"\">Denmark</a>, the alleged perpetrator\u2019s alcohol consumption is likely to work in his favour, but if the victim was under the influence it works against her.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://edda.hi.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Einkenni-og-me%C3%B0fer%C3%B0-nau%C3%B0gunarm%C3%A1la-okt%C3%B3ber-2013.pdf\" title=\"\">Iceland</a>, charges are significantly less likely to be issued if the victim was intoxicated when the rape took place. And cases that are reported within 24 hours to the police are more likely to proceed, even though we know that it normally takes victims more time to come to terms with what actually happened.</p> <p>Indeed, some Nordic countries are looking to the UK for better practices. Sweden is likely to become the first Nordic country to discard its current definition of sexual violence, which focuses on the use of force, and adopt a consent-based one. That focus is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrijeaqc04A\" title=\"\">far from perfect</a> and is not necessarily likely to increase conviction rates, given the high burden of proof in criminal cases.</p> <p>However, the message is considered important, and some hope that when coupled with a gross negligence provision \u2013 modelled on Norwegian law \u2013 a new legal definition could lead to more convictions. That way the prosecutor would not need to prove intent but to establish that the accused acted in an extremely careless manner.</p> <p>As for England and Wales, <a href=\"http://kunskapsbanken.nck.uu.se/nckkb/nck/publik/fil/visa/197/different\" title=\"\">report</a> after <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218135832/rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> (after <a href=\"http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/resources/75/where-are-we-now\" title=\"\">report</a>, after <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110608160754/http://www.equalities.gov.uk/PDF/Stern_Review_acc_FINAL.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a>, after <a href=\"https://www.cps.gov.uk/Publications/equality/vaw/dame_elish_angiolini_rape_review_2015.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a>) has outlined how the justice system can be improved, and how better to address the context in which violence against women takes place. It is time for politicians to translate words into deeds.</p> <p>Victim\u2019s rights to specialist support services must be secured, irrespective of whether they report or not. Consideration should also be given to strengthening victims\u2019 procedural rights \u2013 including the right to a victim lawyer \u2013 in an effort to ensure a genuinely fair trial. A victim lawyer could, for example, challenge sexual history evidence or aggressive cross-examination from defence lawyers.

The trip takes 75 minutes and costs about 3,000 roubles (\u00a338 return). Here you\u2019ll find the remarkable Kizhi Pogost, a compound of two huge and ancient multi-domed cathedrals built entirely of wood, with not a nail to hold them together. Their onion domes are scaled with silvery shingles made of aspen and gleam in the sun. You can wander around the island\u2019s open-air museum with its wooden farmhouses and chapels for glimpses of daily life in pre-revolutionary Russia and admire the painstaking carpentry of the restoration workshop.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://go-karelia.com/news/5699/\"><em>go-karelia.com</em></a><br><strong>LucyGulland</strong></p> <h2><strong>Traditional village near Vladimir</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9a935799e637babd4d4d9e51f306835da5d4357\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9a935799e637babd4d4d9e51f306835da5d4357/0_337_5010_3007/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colourful scarfs, Suzdal, Russia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If you are lucky enough to be in the countryside near Vladimir, 190km east of Moscow, for a bit, Suzdal is an absolutely beautiful village with traditional wooden house, churches and kremlin. It also has a great market where you can buy yourself a gherkin or two from older lady with a single, giant jar of pickles in front of her, or a blini pancake with sour cream and salmon eggs prepared right in front of you... delicious. And if it gets a bit nippy, you can buy a delicate, hand-dyed mohair shawl as soft as a cuddle.<br><strong>Chez Les Matthews</strong></p> <h2><strong>Mafia graves, Yekaterinburg</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"35e35739787823e630180e8da4adbd193ba7cea1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35e35739787823e630180e8da4adbd193ba7cea1/0_744_5079_3049/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mafia graves at the Shirokorenchinskaya Cemetery Yekaterinburg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For a memorable \u2013 if morbid \u2013 experience, visit the mafia graves in the southern Urals city of Yekaterinburg. They are in two cemeteries, one for each of the rival gangs that terrorised the area in the 1990s. Shirokorechenskoe cemetery, in the south-west of the city, is where members of the Central gang were laid to rest. Their graves are easy to spot, although you will need a while to wander around and find them all. They feature full-sized portraits of the deceased, many adorned in gold chains, leather jackets or holding Mercedes car keys.<br><strong>Amy Wolfe</strong></p> <h2><strong>A stop on the Trans-Siberian</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"315833d5322889fa33256f9de6c94e14ed34cd82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/315833d5322889fa33256f9de6c94e14ed34cd82/0_61_911_547/500.jpg\" alt=\"Baikal guesthouse Fedorov Dvor, Russia\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Utulik, a traditional Siberian village on the southern shores of Lake Baikal, has rustic architecture, scenic birch forests and a mountainous backdrop.

We learned Russian songs, sat outside at night with stars and bonfires and experienced the delights of rural Russian cuisine, with daily meals of salted <em>kasha</em> (buckwheat porridge) with jam and shashlik kebabs. A day trip to the island of Olkhon (the fourth-largest island in a lake in the world), organised by the Sarminskaya holiday park, offers a terrifying but exhilarating ride in a rickety old school bus (manned by a one-eyed driver) and a journey into the heart of the <a href=\"http://www.rusnature.info/zap/106.htm\">Pribaikalsky national park</a>. Shake off the nerves with a swim in the freezing cold, eerily transparent waters of the lake or by spotting the hordes of seals that gather on the island.

But beware of \u201cface control\u201d. This 1990s throwback is the bizarre system whereby the hugely unattractive bouncer gets to decide whether you are attractive (or wealthy enough) to enter his establishment. While back home, being female is usually enough to get you in, here the situation is reversed. The abundance of beautiful Russian girls, as well as the general idea that only men can pay for drinks, means being female isn\u2019t necessarily enough. My advice? Dress up, go in small mixed-gender groups, smile, have someone try to speak Russian to the bouncer and, in the background, someone else speak English.

On average, premiums have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/\">risen</a> by about 5.8% a year since Barack Obama took office, compared with 13.2% in the nine years before Obama, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/\">Politifact found</a> earlier this year. Trump, however, is cherry-picking data from <a href=\"http://acasignups.net/\">various states</a> and <a href=\"https://ratereview.healthcare.gov/#urrresults?U2FsdGVkX19n4kcCdR5qUI27%2BwHheoDO2VGbcEEfi84Zrt9YzdawzO8%2BdPHtCLfThVI4mtetRmr28iQ8w29yvQ%3D%3D\">providers</a> where <a href=\"https://ratereview.healthcare.gov/#urrresults?U2FsdGVkX186EmjG4AR6ruydOJE2fGfzzCgpYCDVKZngFNf0hgLfrIhE%2BJuoUQjwImgHKotCy9LrONfdtvsk4im1VSMZcQCpaU3VHLZUiPU%3D\">rates have had higher</a> jumps. The most common healthcare plans will increase 9% on average, according to an <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/analysis-of-2017-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/\">analysis</a> by the Kaiser Family Foundation. </p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cWe take care of illegal immigrants \u2026 better than we take care of our vets\u201d</strong></p> <p>This claim flies in the face of evidence and logic. Like all US citizens, veterans enjoy the basic rights and benefits granted by US law (voting rights, social security, Medicaid, etc), while undocumented migrants (noncitizens) do not. Trump has in the past tried to justify this claim by saying the US spends more on undocumented people than on veterans, but has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/lyin-trump-fact-check-mexico-wall-immigration\"> drawn a $113bn price tag from an explicitly anti-immigration foundation</a>. He also inflated that number. </p> <p>The campaign has said the US spends $2.8bn on housing migrants in prisons, combining an estimate <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/421673/report-us-spent-187-billion-incarcerate-illegal-immigrant-criminals-2014-joel-gehrke\">on prison costs</a> and the 2016 budget for the care and processing of children who came to the US without adults. The Veterans Affairs administration has a 2016 budget of $69.7bn. Veterans and undocumented migrants alike have access to K-12 education, though few veterans would likely seek it, and veterans have access to the Affordable Care Act, military benefits and health benefits, while migrants do not.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cOur inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store, you have no education, no jobs\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump\u2019s repeated claim that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-lies-this-week-taxes-bankruptcy\">African Americans, Hispanics, are living in hell</a>\u201d defies most of American history, from antebellum slavery through the Jim Crow decades, great depression and segregation. Even if Trump is only referring the past half century, he is still wrong by most metrics. </p> <p>Data on employment, education and health show empirical evidence for the <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/18/sharp-differences-over-who-is-hurt-helped-by-their-race/\">persistent reality</a> of <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/27/blacks-with-college-experience-more-likely-to-say-they-faced-discrimination/\">discrimination</a> against black Americans, but also show major gains in the last few decades.

Trump omits, however, two key points: Congress controls the government\u2019s wallet (ie Obama cannot spend or tax without approval from lawmakers), and Obama took office during the financial crisis, when Republicans, Democrats and most economists agreed that the US needed to spend in order to counteract the collapsing economy.

She seems to be citing another <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan\">analysis, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center</a>, about the debt, and possibly overstates its estimated consequences. </p> <p>That center warned that without severe spending cuts, the plan would balloon national debt \u201cby nearly 80% of gross domestic product by 2036, offsetting some or all of the incentive effects of the tax cuts\u201d. According to that group, half of Trump\u2019s tax cuts would go to the top 1% of earners, and most families below the top 20% of earners would have income gains of less than 1%.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cWhen you ran the State Department, $6bn was missing! Maybe it was stolen \u2026 nobody knows\u201d</strong></p> <p>This is not correct.

A Trump contractor hired undocumented Polish workers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and in 1983 union members sued one of their organizers. Trump appeared in court in 1990 and blamed the contractor overseeing the project, which was for Trump Tower.</p> <p><strong>Trump: Obama \u201chas thousands and thousands of people, they have no idea where they come from\u201d</strong></p> <p>Ten thousand Syrian refugees have come to the United States in 2016, but Trump makes it sound misleadingly large.</p> <p>He is patently wrong about the screening process. The US has among the most intensive screening process in the world for refugees: it requires they register and interview with the United Nations, which then must refer them to the US; refugees who pass this test then interview with State Department contractors and have at least two background checks; then they have three fingerprint and photo screenings; then US immigration reviews the case; then Homeland Security interviews the refugee; then a doctor examines the refugee, and finally several security agencies perform one last check after the refugee has been matched with a resettlement agency. </p> <p>The process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">takes 18 months</a> to two years.

He said nice things about me \u2026 He has no respect for our president.\u201d</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s not clear whether Trump has ever spoken with the Russian president. Putin was invited to but did not attend a 2013 beauty pageant in Moscow, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-trumps-financial-ties-to-russia-and-his-unusual-flattery-of-vladimir-putin/2016/06/17/dbdcaac8-31a6-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html\">one of the oligarchs</a> who helped organize the event. \u201cWill he become my new best friend?\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/347191326112112640\">wondered</a> beforehand.</p> <p>The pair may have communicated through intermediaries. In 2014, Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKkKQmbyECw\">told a National Press Club luncheon</a>: \u201cI was in Moscow recently and I spoke, indirectly and directly, with President Putin, who could not have been nicer, and we had a tremendous success.\u201d A year earlier, Trump <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-putin-tried-arrange-meeting-moscow-source-n619006\">told MSNBC</a>: \u201cI do have a relationship and I can tell you that he\u2019s very interested in what we\u2019re doing here today.\u201d</p> <p>Last November, Trump <a href=\"http://time.com/4107636/transcript-read-the-full-text-of-the-fourth-republican-debate-in-milwaukee/\">claimed in a debate</a> that he \u201cgot to know him very well because we were both on 60 Minutes\u201d. They appeared in separate, pre-taped segments and were not on set together.</p> <p>Trump has repeatedly tried to do business in Russia, and his refusal to release tax returns prevents him proving that he has no assets there. </p> <p>Putin has never called Trump \u201ca genius\u201d; he used the Russian word \u044f\u0440\u043a\u0438\u0439, which means \u201ccolorful\u201d or \u201cflamboyant\u201d. Trump likely heard the word translated as \u201cbright\u201d or \u201cbrilliant\u201d, though its connotations are often more pejorative than not: bright in the sense of glaring and gaudy, brilliant in the sense of dazzling light. Putin also called him \u201ctalented, undoubtedly\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not our business to decide his merits; that\u2019s for US voters,\u201d Putin said earlier this year.

Moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News will have questions cued to the six topic areas announced in advance: debt and entitlements, immigration, economy, the supreme court, foreign hotspots and fitness to be president.</p> <p>But the candidates\u2019 preferred messages in recent days, especially as Trump is concerned, touch on different themes. Trump has been talking a lot about a rigged election and promised to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington. In recent days he has proposed ethics reform laws and congressional term limits. Meanwhile, Breitbart, Trump\u2019s phantom media arm, published today (for the first time, it seems) the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/10/former-tv-reporter-accuses-bill-clinton-of-sexual-assault-229987\">story</a> of a former Arkansas broadcaster, Leslie Milwee, who says Bill Clinton sexually assaulted her in 1980. She\u2019s invited to the debate.</p> <p>Trump says that Clinton emails released by Wikileaks show she is part of an international cabal, with banks and the media, to destroy the country and enrich and empower themselves. He has contended that the state department offered the FBI a quid pro quo for declassifying certain Clinton emails just as they were to come in for public scrutiny. Any of these would-be scandals might be expected to come up.</p> <p>Clinton, for her part, may want to discuss the attack by Trump on his Republican colleagues; Trump\u2019s increasingly wild talk about voter fraud; or the astounding outpouring since the last debate of women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct or assault. (He denies all the claims.) Here is a video telling their stories:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/583qb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2817569\"            data-video-name=\"Nine women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian, Access Hollywood, AP, CNN, Getty Images, NBC, Reuters, Palm Beach Post\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58066cf1e4b0cd26ff71e6cc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/19/161018womenst_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/19/161018womenst.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/19/161018womenst_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\">Nine women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T00:10:01.443Z\">at 1.10am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580802f1e4b005f21833b3c9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T23:37:30.704Z\">12.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Confirmed: Wayne Newton is coming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/788884708327165952\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/debate2016?src=hash\">#debate2016</a> guests tonight include Marcus Luttrell, Pat Smith, and the legendary Wayne Newton.</p>&mdash; Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/788884708327165952\">October 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m_giioppT4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0m_giioppT4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Speaking of legendary Las Vegas acts... did anyone think to invite Britney?</p> <p>Doesn\u2019t matter.

It\u2019s hard to feel excited or even relieved, though, when her road to victory is so slick with the odium of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>Between the video of Trump bragging about sexual assault and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/15/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-cathy-heller\">woman after woman</a> coming forward to claim he did just that, it\u2019s hard to stave off that sick-to-your-stomach feeling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/michelle-obama-speech-transcript-donald-trump\">Michelle Obama described so powerfully last week</a>. For those of us who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/28/jessica-valenti-my-life-as-a-sex-object\">endured a lifetime of unwanted leers and touches</a>, this last leg of the campaign has been painful. And as Trump surrogates and supporters \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/17/melania-trump-billy-bush-groping-tape-cnn-interview\">even his wife</a> \u2013 continue to shrug off the offenses as \u201clocker room talk\u201d or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787990502415167488\">outright lies</a>, we\u2019re reminded of just how easily women are disbelieved.</p> <p>There is one thing, though, that\u2019s giving me hope in the midst of this ugliness: the outcry from men who refuse to characterize sexual harassment and abuse as normal male behavior. Too often, discussions about sexual assault center only on women \u2013 our victimization and perceived culpability. Since the tape\u2019s release, though, the national conversation has shifted: men are coming forward en masse to reject the idea that \u201creal men\u201d talk about abusing women \u2013 that this is normal language to use in a locker room or anywhere else.</p> <p>Read further:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-sexism-misogyny-men\">The silver lining of Trump's misogyny?

Fox News anchor Chris Wallace - the first anchor from that network to host a presidential debate - will moderate tonight\u2019s engagement. For a network that has been embroiled in scandal that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-leaves-fox-news-sexual-harassment-claims\">brought down its chief executive</a>, Wallace\u2019s position is an opportunity to hit the reset button on a miserable year - although Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/fox-anchor-megyn-kelly-meets-donald-trump\">willingness to feud</a> with Fox News personalities means that Wallace will not be protected from onstage criticism from the candidate just because he\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/06/trump-only-goes-on-hannity-megyn-kelly-clashes-with-friend-at-10-oclock\">besties with Sean Hannity.</a></p> <p><strong>What is the format? </strong>The debate will consist of six 15-minute segments, following the same format as the first presidential debate. Each segment will be approximately 15 minutes long. Wallace will open each segment with a question, after which each candidate will have two minutes to respond. Clinton and Trump will then have an opportunity to respond to each other. Wallace may use the balance of the time in the segment for a deeper discussion of the topic. Those topics, <a href=\"http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=2016debates\">as revealed by the Commission on Presidential Debates</a>, are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Debt and entitlements</li> <li>Immigration</li> <li>The economy</li> <li>Supreme Court</li> <li>Foreign hot spots</li> <li>Fitness to be president</li> </ul> <p><strong>Where is the debate being held? </strong>The debate is being held at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, which means that the journalists covering the debate are going to come home broke and hung over (they\u2019ve earned it, trust me).</p> <p><strong>How do I watch the misery? </strong>That\u2019s the easy part!

States vary on how late they allow abortions \u2013 in some states there have been attempts to introduce very short time limits, including in North Dakota where a proposal in 2013 for a ban six weeks after a woman\u2019s last menstrual period was ruled unconstitutional, but in most states the time limit is at the start of the third trimester or earlier. There are nine states without specific term prohibitions, but clinics do not abort at such late terms: only 1.2% of abortions occur after 21 weeks, according to the nonprofit Guttmacher Institute.</p> <p><strong>\u201cClinton wants open borders\u201d</strong></p> <p>Clinton does not want \u201copen borders\u201d: she supports reform to let people pass background checks and pay back taxes in order to stay in the US, and she supports Obama\u2019s executive actions to shield some migrants, such as people who were brought to the US as children. Like Obama, she supports deportation for people with criminal records.</p> <p><strong>\u201cObama has moved millions of people out\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump is correct: Barack Obama has deported more than 2.5 million people, more than any other recent president, but he has prioritized migrants with criminal records. \u201cMillions and millions\u201d, however, is an exaggeration, and Obama also supports shielding millions of undocumented immigrants without criminal records, and reform for citizenship.</p> <p><strong>Obama \u201chas thousands and thousands of people, they have no idea where they come from\u201d<br></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/defy.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/defy.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>Ten thousand Syrian refugees have come to the United States in 2016, but Trump makes it sound misleadingly large.</p> <p>He is patently wrong about the screening process.

Trump likely heard the word translated as \u201cbright\u201d or \u201cbrilliant\u201d, though its connotations are often more pejorative than not: bright in the sense of glaring and gaudy, brilliant in the sense of dazzling light.

The US <a href=\"http://www.act.nato.int/nsip\">currently pays</a> about 22% of overall Nato spending, compared to Germany\u2019s 15%, France\u2019s 11%, the UK\u2019s 10%, etc, and most Nato members <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_01/20160129_160128-pr-2016-11-eng.pdf\">fail to pay the 2% of GDP</a> into defense as the alliance\u2019s guidelines dictate.

As of 28 September 2016,<a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current\"> it was $19.5tn</a>. Trump omits, however, two key points: Congress controls the government\u2019s wallet (ie Obama cannot spend or tax without approval from lawmakers), and Obama took office during the financial crisis, when Republicans, Democrats and most economists agreed that the US needed to spend in order to counteract the collapsing economy. Pence has the right numbers but imputes too much responsibility on the president.</p> <p><strong>\u201cWhen you ran the state department, $6bn was missing! Maybe it was stolen \u2026 nobody knows\u201d</strong></p> <p>This is not correct. Trump is alluding to a March 2014 alert, about contractor spending in the Middle East and Africa, by the state department\u2019s inspector general, who was so perturbed by careless language around the $6bn figure that he wrote the Washington Post a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/about-the-state-depts-missing-6-billion/2014/04/13/a6130790-c194-11e3-9ee7-02c1e10a03f0_story.html?utm_term=.452a9d665b36\">letter</a> that April. His alert did not conclude that the money was \u201cmissing\u201d he told the Post, but rather that officials had failed \u201cto adequately maintain contract files\u201d that created \u201csignificant financial risk\u201d.

During the FBI investigation, Petraeus lied to agents, according to the plea deal. But the justice department only sentenced Petraeus to two years\u2019 probation and a $100,000 fine, provoking accusations that this relatively lenient sentence was evidence of a double standard for the powerful. The justice department\u2019s lenience toward Petraeus actually made it more difficult, in part, for prosecutors to recommend charges against Clinton.<br><br>This week Cartwright pled guilty to lying to the FBI in an investigation into leaking classified information about operations against Iran to journalists. Like Petraeus, though, the FBI found actual intentional wrongdoing in Cartwright\u2019s case.

Thirty-one states have Republican governors, including the swing states of Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada and Ohio; Pennsylvania only elected a Democratic governor in 2015. Polls show Trump losing even in some states where governors have strongly supported him.

  "<p>On the face of it, there is nothing very eerie about Southend Pier. Opened in 1830 and restored many times since, it\u2019s meant to be&#xa0;a place of fun, as cheap and cheerful as the town itself (\u201cSouthend is the Pier, the Pier is Southend,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnbetjeman\" title=\"\">John Betjeman</a> said). Certainly Rachel Lichtenstein, who grew up nearby and whose memories of the area are \u201cfilled with colour, noise and laughter\u201d, was unprepared for the night she spent five years ago moored beside the pier\u2019s lower deck in&#xa0;a Dutch barge called (correct spelling and no irony) Ideaal:</p> <p>Something kept banging incessantly against the hull, metal on metal. It felt like we were in a war zone \u2026 I began to hear other noises aside from the banging \u2013 the clamour of a great crowd of people crying out \u2026 a woman\u2019s scream, the dreadful noise of children sobbing \u2013 the sound of hundreds of men shouting. It went on for hours, unbearably loud \u2026</p> <p>Lichtenstein was among a group of people, mostly artists, on a voyage exploring the Thames Estuary \u2013 downriver from Tower Bridge to the sea. The voyage was cut short after the boat\u2019s engine clogged with silt and debris. But for her the journey had only just begun. After 15 years in east London, she had recently moved back to Leigh-on-Sea and wanted to learn about the history of the estuary \u2013 as well as finding a rational explanation for those terrifying noises under the pier.</p> <p>Part urban-industrial sprawl, part wild marshland, the Thames Estuary is&#xa0;an area of 800 nautical square miles, stretching down past Clacton in Essex and Whitstable in Kent and out into the North Sea. Its people have often been treated with condescension and many of their settlements (Sheppey, Canvey Island, Jaywick etc) with derision. But it\u2019s also a place of subversive cultural energy, home to Dickens\u2019s Magwitch and the band Dr Feelgood. Through her&#xa0;travels, interviews and researches, Lichtenstein restores its edgy pride and celebrates its muddy beauty.</p> <p>She talks to tugmen, dock workers, ornithologists and mudlarkers; takes part in a Thames barge race; walks the Broomway on Foulness, \u201cBritain\u2019s most dangerous path\u201d; gets tossed around in a cockleboat (\u201cit was like being inside a tumble dryer\u201d); and samples mud cola, a drink made from Estuary slime. She&#xa0;is a generous listener \u2013 a diligent reader, too, paying homage to those who have trodden similar paths before her, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robert-macfarlane\" title=\"\">Robert MacFarlane</a>, Ken Worpole, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/iain-sinclair\" title=\"\">Iain Sinclair</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/wgsebald\" title=\"\">WG Sebald</a>. Rather than impose herself on the landscape, she lets it seep into her psyche. Unsurprisingly, after that night on the Ideeal, what often comes through is fear.</p> <p>Among the more obvious dangers is the SS Montgomery, which ran aground near Sheerness in 1944 with 1,400 tonnes of bombs on board. The wreck is still visible and carefully patrolled. The lone canoeist who once perched on top of it while eating a cheese sandwich can count himself lucky: according to one expert a detonation of&#xa0;the unexploded bombs onboard would be enough to create a tidal wave engulfing the Isle of Sheppey. There are many other wrecks in the Estuary, more per square foot, we\u2019re told, than anywhere along the UK coastline, the most famous of them HMS London, which went down in 1665 with the loss of 300 lives (Pepys records the sinking in his diary). Divers continue to explore the wreck, at their peril: \u201cIf you came up on the surface when a container ship passes,\u201d one of them tells Lichtenstein, \u201cyou\u2019d be dead.\u201d</p> <p>Death is a recurrent theme in her account. The fishermen she talks to are stoics: the job may be smelly, exhausting and dangerous, but they\u2019d never give it up. Their wives are not so sanguine, least of all Jane Dolby, whose husband Colin disappeared with his trawler when a storm blew up from nowhere eight years ago. In memory of him, and to raise money for the charity that helped her out after he died, she set up the Fishwives Choir, whose recording of \u201cWhen the Boat Comes In\u201d was a hit single.</p> <p>Boats may be named after women and referred to in third-person feminine pronouns, but even today, it seems, having a woman on board is regarded as bad luck. The author\u2019s experiences don\u2019t exactly dispel the myth. One cold March day, she goes out on a sailing dinghy with two male friends, one of them a photographer, and they capsize. She saves the camera, and the memory card inside her ruined voice recorder miraculously works when played back. But her left hand is broken, and requires an operation to insert a metal plate. The morphine she is given to relieve the pain brings on nightmares \u2013 she\u2019s back with the ghosts under Southend Pier. For weeks she\u2019s laid low, bedbound and unable to write, let alone get back on the water.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Lichtenstein's vulnerability is engaging: she doesn\u2019t pretend that putting this book together has been plain sailing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her vulnerability is engaging: she doesn\u2019t pretend that putting this book together has been plain sailing. Among the physical challenges is a trip to Sealand \u2013 the offshore fort declared as an independent principality in 1967 \u2013 which requires being winched up on to the seven-storey platform by rope. It\u2019s worth it for the view and to hear how much time members of the Bates family spend there since they laid claim to it. Not a lot, it seems, except when they\u2019re showing round film crews, though ever since the attempted seizure of Sealand by a group of Germans and Austrians in 1978 (an invasion that the Bateses repelled with sawn-off shotguns) they remain fiercely possessive of their rights.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/22/martians-music-and-mud-how-the-thames-estuary-broadened-cultural-horizons\">Martians, music and mud: how the Thames Estuary broadened cultural horizons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sealand lies just outside British territorial waters. But even within the Thames Estuary, there\u2019s a history of lawlessness. It\u2019s inscribed in local place names (Dead Man\u2019s Island, Bedlams Bottom, Horrid Hill, Slaughterhouse Point) and persists in different kinds of&#xa0;smuggling, whether of drugs or asylum seekers. To some, the building of the massive London Gateway Port is&#xa0;just the latest instance in a long line of landgrabs and sea grabs. The port promises to create hundreds of jobs when it opens. Meanwhile, environmentalists claim, the dredging carried out by its owners, the Dubai-based company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/dubai-world\" title=\"\">DP World</a>, has destroyed much of the marine life (sprats, herring, cockles and oysters) on which local livelihoods depend.</p> <p>Lichtenstein dutifully makes room for opposing voices. Her prose reads flatly at times (unlike Sebald and Sinclair, she\u2019s no great stylist) but that&#xa0;seems almost apt, given the level terrain, and she\u2019s an appealing guide: rather than come with prior knowledge, she learns as she goes along, and we learn with her. Did she know a brail from a gybe, or a gaff from a sprit, when she started? Probably not. And&#xa0;for the rest of us who don\u2019t know,&#xa0;there\u2019s a glossary.</p> <p>Though she never quite solves the mystery of Southend Pier, beyond noting the number of suicides and other tragedies in its vicinity, she does overcome her demons. The book culminates in a trip to explore the outer reaches of the estuary \u2013 the parts she failed to see five years before. At one point the yacht gets stuck on a sandbank, worryingly close to an offshore windfarm, colliding with which \u201cwould be like throwing a matchstick model against a brick wall\u201d. But she holds her nerve and even (as photographs show) takes the helm. Her mood is buoyant and so is the writing, with lovely descriptions of water, weather and sky. Five years on, she gets her sea legs.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Estuary </em>by Rachel Lichtenstein (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a318.99).

  "<p> A radical overhaul of Westminster constituency boundaries in Scotland has been condemned as \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cundemocratic\u201d by both the Scottish National party and Scottish Labour.</p> <p>The proposals from the Boundary Commission for Scotland leave only one existing constituency unchanged, in addition to two island groupings protected by legislation. They come a month after similar plans for England and Wales were dismissed as gerrymandering by Labour, after analysts suggested they could result in the opposition losing 23 sitting MPs.</p> <p>The changes, initiated by David Cameron as part of an effort to cut the number of politicians in the House of Commons from 650 to 600, will result in the number of Westminster constituencies north of the border being reduced from 59 to 53.</p> <p>Two of these 53 \u2013 Na h-Eileanan an Iar, or the Western Isles, and Orkney and Shetland \u2013 are defined in legislation and will not be subject to change. </p> <p>The shifting boundaries aim to ensure that each person\u2019s vote is of similar value by equalising the number of registered voters in each constituency to within 5% of 74,769, and will inevitably hit the SNP, which won 56 seats out of 59 in the 2015 general election, hardest. Only 11 existing Scottish constituencies have electorates within 5% of the quota, largely because of the country\u2019s divergent population distribution between rural and urban areas. </p> <p>The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, described the proposals as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. The newly elected SNP deputy leader said: \u201cAt a time when Scotland already faces a deep and growing democratic deficit, with a Tory government that we didn\u2019t vote for imposing increasingly rightwing policies against our will, it is vital that the Scottish people have strong elected representation at Westminster to stand up for Scotland\u2019s interests and to hold the UK government to account.\u201d</p> <p>Robertson added: \u201cFurthermore, it is outrageous and undemocratic that the UK government is planning to cut the number of Scottish MPs while it continues to pack the unelected and unaccountable House of Lords with yet more Tory donors and cronies to do the government\u2019s bidding.\u201d</p> <p>The proposals include a significant redrawing of constituency boundaries in the north of Scotland, with the largest new constituency by area, Highland North, taking in Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross along with the bulk of Ross, Skye and Lochaber, currently held by the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford.</p> <p>Blackford told the Guardian that the plans showed little appreciation of geography, or the particular challenges of representing a widely spread constituency. \u201cIt is not right to have such large constituencies in the north of Scotland. It would appear from the plans that about 50% of the land mass of Scotland is to be represented by three MPs, which brings about basic issues of democratic accountability and accessibility to constituents.\u201d</p> <p>Proposed changes to urban areas have also drawn criticism. Plans to cut Glasgow\u2019s constituencies to six would leaving the city\u2019s seven sitting SNP MPs facing a round of musical chairs.</p> <p>Scottish Labour\u2019s Westminster spokesman, Ian Murray, described plans for six new constituencies for Edinburgh as being drawn \u201cby someone who knows very little about our capital city\u201d.</p> <p>Murray\u2019s own constituency of Edinburgh South would face a split between the once traditionally Labour-supporting Edinburgh East, whose voters migrated to the SNP at the last election, and the more affluent Edinburgh South West and Central seat. He said: \u201cThe proposals would split communities down the middle, with one seat stretching from Bonaly Country Park in the shadow of the Pentland Hills all the way to the top of Leith Walk in the city centre.\u201d</p> <p>Murray said: \u201cThese Tory proposals to redraw constituency boundaries are unfair, undemocratic and unacceptable. They are based on an out-of-date version of the electoral register with nearly two million voters across the UK missing.</p> <p>\u201cIn the past, ministers have argued that cutting the number of MPs will save the taxpayer \u00a312m, but David Cameron created scores of extra unelected peers in the House of Lords, costing \u00a334m. Labour has proposed abolishing the House of Lords, replacing it with an elected senate of the nations and regions.\u201d</p> <p>Prior to publication, the prospect was raised of the Scottish secretary, David Mundell, the only Tory MP in Scotland, losing his seat to the SNP. However, the planned changes to his Dumfriesshire constituency appear to take only a bite of the central belt likely to be diluted by still more of the rural Conservative demographic that elected him previously.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The UK minister for the constitution, Chris Skidmore, said the proposals, which will now be subject to consultation, with final recommendations submitted to the Commons in autumn 2018, would cut the cost of politics.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe are committed to ensuring fair and equal representation for the voting public across the UK is in place by the next general election.\u201d</p>",

The value of compassion has plummeted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/11/pound-pressure-city-fears-hard-brexit-bank-of-england-business-live\">like that of the pound</a>. What is deemed valuable now is hardness. Stay hard for ever. Permanently hard. Hard Brexit. This is delusional, but it is a bravado whereby the weak and the vulnerable must be punished for reminding us that they exist. This fear of foreigners is political Viagra for a set of limp leaders.</p> <p>Those who speak up for migrants are often those in possession of some actual facts about the situation. The migration of displaced people is massive and ongoing. Yes, more will come, however many fences are erected; yes, immigration has effects. It is no good simply saying that we are a rich country and can afford it, when so many feel very far from rich. The Brexit vote is being interpreted by the extreme right as a referendum on immigration. I continue to believe it was much messier and more complex than that. But alarm bells are ringing because of the flood of racism that is now permissible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/22/good-immigrant-review-nikesh-shukla-britain-racist\">The Good Immigrant review \u2013 an unflinching dialogue about race and racism in the UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is shameful that reuniting some teenagers with their families has caused this latest outpouring.

  "<p>Why has there never been a male Bridget Jones? It may seem odd that this should have occurred to me half-way through the latest instalment of Alastair Campbell\u2019s seemingly never-ending diaries, which are neither fictional nor comic, and yet it did.</p> <p>It might be the habit he develops of opening each entry with a fitness assessment (\u201cPulse 53. Bad run, OK swim\u201d) that reads like pure Bridget. But perhaps it\u2019s that this time the heart&#xa0;of the diary isn\u2019t political but emotional, dominated by a mid-life crisis with which one suspects many men will instantly identify.</p> <p>Having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/jun/23/uk.labour\" title=\"\">quit Downing Street in 2003</a>, chiefly because his partner Fiona Millar urged him to, Campbell, in this new volume, is torn between two very different lives; a domesticated one with the long-suffering Millar and the kids, versus the bad-boy charms of Tony Blair and an exhilarating but ultimately toxic job at the heart of government. Deep down, he knows the latter isn\u2019t really good for him. But the former doesn\u2019t quite feel like enough. Strip away the politics and I suspect that conflict between career and family \u2013 along with the faintly obsessive<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jun/18/channel5.broadcasting\" title=\"\"> triathlon training</a>, niggling ailments and the old struggle against depression overlaid with a new confusion about his purpose in life \u2013 will resonate rather widely. Like Ed Balls\u2019s autobiography, this represents a new, more emotional strand of political writing. But are Campbell\u2019s interior dramas enough to sustain such a long, hefty book?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/24/burden-power-alastair-campbell-review\">The Burden of Power: Countdown to Iraq by Alastair Campbell \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The action opens just as he leaves Downing Street, although arguably he barely leaves at all. Blair, who seems wholly in denial about his departure, rings for advice within hours before firing off a 15-page \u201cweekend note\u201d to the man who no longer works for him.</p> <p>And so it goes on, with Campbell hovering in perpetual and occasionally resentful limbo; neither out nor in, by turns guilty about backsliding on his promise to Millar to give it up and guilty about leaving Blair to it. Before long he is \u201clethargic, depressed \u2026 so not used to this kind of meandering, not-sure existence\u201d, struggling with both his mental and physical health and having rows with his partner. She\u2019s impatient for them both to move on, and increasingly critical of their old bosses (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/06/cherieblair.broadcasting\" title=\"\">she formerly worked for Cherie Blair</a>). Campbell feels he gets no credit for having quit, but still can\u2019t let go or stop defending Blair\u2019s corner.</p> <p>Meanwhile politics follows him around everywhere he goes. Even a consultation with his GP descends into a debate about Iraq, and his days are peppered with calls from old mates in government moaning about other old mates in government, like squabbling children begging a parent to intervene \u2013 often to Campbell\u2019s frustration, now that he\u2019s out of the daily fray. As he&#xa0;says, apropos a friendlier than expected lunch with Balls, \u201cIt was interesting how a little bit of distance was making me look at people in a different light.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps in part because of this new&#xa0;perspective, Blair comes across slightly&#xa0;less likably this time; needier, more self-interested but also more self-doubting, and increasingly preoccupied with the soul-sapping war of attrition with Gordon Brown.</p> <p>Again and again, Campbell uses the phrase \u201cgoing round in circles\u201d to describe the interminable, fruitless debates about whether Blair should sack Brown, try <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/19/tony-blair-gordon-brown-war-labour\" title=\"\">to save their relationship</a>, or quit himself (the surprise for many readers will be how early, and how seriously, Blair considered resigning). But if it feels like groundhog day to Campbell, it\u2019s arguably more so for the reader. In truth the middle of the book drags, redeemed only by a fascinating and sympathetic account at the end of what was going on inside Brown\u2019s head during the 2005 election.</p> <p>The snag, however, is that suddenly all this feels like ancient history. The Labour landscape was unchanged enough under Brown, and even under Ed Miliband, for the earlier diaries to offer valuable insights. But the world Campbell describes is so alien to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour that it barely makes sense to compare the two. The strength of the diary format, the sense that they\u2019re an immediate first draft of history, has become a weakness; what you long for now is a more considered analysis of how on earth Britain got from there to here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd8445e67be8e4c6d256b8e0fd4d437ff46baa30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd8445e67be8e4c6d256b8e0fd4d437ff46baa30/0_4_2737_1643/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alastair Campbell announces his resignation as Tony Blair\u2019s director of communications, August 2003.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alastair Campbell announces his resignation as Tony Blair\u2019s director of communications, August 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Barbour/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Campbell has a stab in his introduction, arguing that in retrospect the journals show New Labour wasn\u2019t sufficiently cemented into the party and didn\u2019t nurture new talent for the future. Perhaps, but the overriding impression the reader gets is of the impossible relationship between Blair and Brown becoming a black hole that sucked the life out of Labour, leaving too little energy for anything else. As a lobby reporter during that period, I did sometimes worry that we got hung up on \u201cthe TB-GBs\u201d at the expense of policy. If so, I suspect we weren\u2019t the only ones.</p> <p>It\u2019s striking, too, that while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/20/alistair-campbell-iraq-war-corbyn\" title=\"\">Iraq naturally casts a long shadow</a> over this period, only once does Campbell record a conversation between himself, Blair and chief of staff Jonathan Powell about whether it was actually right to invade. (For the record it\u2019s Campbell, who describes himself feeling somewhat \u201cused\u201d by the Americans and wonders if they did the \u201cright thing in the wrong way\u201d, whose view perhaps best stands the test of the time.)</p> <p>What is clear in retrospect, however, is that the anti-immigrant backlash fuelling Brexit was growing even then. The late pollster Philip Gould is the Cassandra of this story, warning as early as March 2004 of \u201cthe most racist&#xa0;and unpleasant\u201d focus groups he&#xa0;has ever conducted \u2013 although anger then was directed at asylum seekers, not EU&#xa0;migrants.</p> <p>There is also a brief but fascinating passage about Blair\u2019s promised (and ultimately abandoned) referendum on the EU constitution, and his desire to \u201cget to a position on Europe where the question was in or out\u201d. Campbell could hardly be expected to draw these threads together and predict Brexit in one late night diary entry in 2004, but it would be fascinating to see him try to retrace the steps. What a shame it\u2019s too late for his publishers to skip the next two diary volumes, and ask Campbell instead for the definitive book on why New Labour ultimately failed.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;<em>Diaries Volume 5: Outside, Inside, 2003-2005</em>&#xa0;is published by Robson.

We look at regulations all the time. I moved to disallow a few of them. <strong>There is no such thing as an automatic sunset clause in regulations.</strong> That is just false.

  "<p>Byelections come in many shapes and sizes. Sometimes they pass without notice. Often the victors are a foregone conclusion. They rarely change the political weather of the nation, notwithstanding the hype. About the only consistent trait is the fevered enthusiasm with which Lib Dems participate in every byelection available. Ignored, derided or outgunned by our larger opponents on the national stage, byelections give us a precious electoral Petri dish in which we can finally compete on a level playing field.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/19/witney-byelection-labour-and-lib-dems-hope-to-cash-in-on-tory-divisions\" title=\"\">In Witney</a>, thousands of Lib-Dem activists will descend on David Cameron\u2019s constituency to challenge his 25,000-vote majority. Liz Leffman, our superb parliamentary candidate \u2013 a local councillor and successful businesswoman \u2013 has been omnipresent. Lib-Dem leaflets have rained down on unsuspecting doormats across the length and breadth of the constituency. Inevitably, our exertions are somewhat patronisingly portrayed as the frenetic response of a party still reeling from the drubbing meted out to us in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2015/may/07/live-uk-election-results-in-full\" title=\"\">general election last year</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/19/witney-byelection-labour-and-lib-dems-hope-to-cash-in-on-tory-divisions\">Witney byelection: Labour and Lib Dems hope to cash in on Tory divisions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 something else is going on. When I visited a farm in Witney recently I was struck how, as we stood in lush Oxfordshire pastures admiring a herd of cattle grazing in near perfect bucolic harmony, the fearful prospect of a \u201chard\u201d Brexit dominated the conversation. I didn\u2019t ask, but my strong impression was that the family I was visiting had never contemplated voting anything other than Conservative in the past. Indeed, the national status and personable charm of their outgoing MP would have retained an irresistible appeal for such farming voters.</p> <p>But their unease at what is happening to our country \u2013 and what may happen to their family farm \u2013 was palpable. What will happen to rural subsidies? Will farm exports be checked at the border? What effect will the plummeting pound have on the price of fertilisers? Why is the government still not providing answers to even the most elementary questions?</p> <p>These anxious queries are repeated in myriad ways across a constituency that mixes traditional farming with hi-tech startups and a world-beating Formula One industrial cluster. A majority of local voters might traditionally vote Conservative, but a majority voted for remain on 23 June too. And they have been telling Lib-Dem canvassers in growing numbers that they do not want to be railroaded towards an economically self-harming \u201chard Brexit\u201d by Liam Fox, Boris Johnson and David Davis. They are desperate to see a sensible, balanced approach to our future outside the EU. They are increasingly dismayed by the needless turbulence created by a Conservative party that appears \u2013 once again \u2013 more intent on talking to itself rather than serving the long-term interests of the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81b7e36abb72a94855fc6bf0418ecc3caf619000\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81b7e36abb72a94855fc6bf0418ecc3caf619000/0_1111_3520_2110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Clegg joins candidate Liz Leffman campaigning in the Witney byelection.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I would urge any Green, Labour and moderate Conservative voter in Witney to set aside their traditional party loyalties and support Liz Leffman.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Pilston/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Could this carry Liz Leffman across the winning line? Unlikely \u2013 if not wholly impossible, as there is no other candidate from any other party remotely near challenging the Conservatives. Not only would it represent a Lazarus-like resurrection for the Lib Dems, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen in a generation, it would also require a spectacularly sudden and wholesale collapse of support for the Conservatives. Such sudden abandonment of political parties in government tends only to happen when people are directly feeling the detrimental economic effects of their policies \u2013 that may well happen in the next few years, but at present it is an anticipated fear rather than a lived reality for many people in Witney.</p> <p>But even if such a dramatic upset does not occur today, a strong challenge to Conservative hegemony by the Lib Dems in Witney could nonetheless send a powerful message straight to Theresa May: don\u2019t take your own people for granted, they don\u2019t like the unyielding manner in which you appear to have interpreted the referendum vote; don\u2019t throw the single market baby out with the EU bathwater, the value of people\u2019s jobs and livelihoods cannot be entirely subjugated to the issue of immigration; you may be politically insulated from any meaningful political accountability by a phalanx of aggressive support in the Brexit press, but remember it\u2019s voters not newspaper editors to whom you are ultimately answerable.</p> <p>So I would urge any Green, Labour and moderate Conservative voter in Witney to set aside their traditional party loyalties and support Liz Leffman as the only candidate able to challenge the hard Brexit-supporting Conservative candidate. I realise I may not be the most obvious person to appeal to Labour voters but we all now operate in an entirely altered political environment. The livid anger of the coalition years between Labour and the Lib Dems \u2013 the former condemning every compromise as a betrayal, the latter every denunciation as a denial of economic reality \u2013 has now been supplanted by a huge chasm between openness and introversion where we broadly find ourselves on the same side in favour of openness.</p> <p>British politics is hugely fluid and unpredictable right now. We have a prime minister without a mandate of her own presiding over a hardline Brexit government that is ignoring the deep fractures in a country crying out for more unity, not further division.

Now they want to be out, with many opt-ins.\u201d</p> <p>There is a strong feeling in EU capitals that Britain is being unrealistic \u2013 even deluded \u2013 in its expectations, that it cannot possibly walk away with a better deal than it was offered to stay, and must in any event end up with a worse one than it (and everyone else) currently enjoys.</p> <p>One reason for this is straightforward concern about other Eurosceptic populists knocking at the gate: in the Netherlands, France and Germany, the likes of Geert Wilders, Marine Le Pen and Frauke Petry will make further inroads in elections during 2017.</p> <p>Mark Rutte, prime minister of the traditionally Anglophile Netherlands, told his parliament this week he was \u201ctraining like a boxer\u201d for Brexit negotiations. Kees Verhoeven, a member of the same assembly\u2019s European affairs committee, said there was simply \u201cno political space to make it easy\u201d for the UK, and that \u201cthe only thing that matters is, don\u2019t make the UK an argument for populists to leave\u201d.</p> <p>Even deeper than that, single-market solidarity, upholding the four freedoms, maintaining the integrity of the bloc\u2019s institutions have, of necessity, hardened into top priorities. Whatever Brexiters may say about UK sales of Mercedes and prosecco, they will take second place. </p> <p>For many on the continent, Brexit is a political project \u2013 so the EU will respond politically. Two of Germany\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/13/german-trade-bodies-back-angela-merkels-tough-stance-over-brexit\">largest trade associations this month again backed this stance</a>, even if it comes at a short-term cost, saying allowing any British opt-out from the four freedoms would mark the beginning of the end of the single market.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/19/el-brexit-la-brexit-eu-divided-over-gender-of-uk-departure\">Europe's first ruling on Brexit: it's masculine, unless you're Italian</a> </p> </aside>  <p>EU diplomats speak, too, of genuine shock at proposals by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/government-faces-backlash-from-business-leaders-over-foreign-workers\">oblige British firms to disclose how many foreign workers</a> they employ. Even if it was swiftly withdrawn, the tenor of the suggestion, with its echoes of far-right doctrines of national preference, was greeted with astonishment. </p> <p>In Paris, where Hollande talked of the need for the UK to face \u201ca threat, a risk ... a price\u201d and ministers are agreed the City must lose its passporting rights and much of its euro trade, <a href=\"https://www.omfif.org/analysis/commentary/2016/october/nous-regrettons-le-brexit-but/\">officials say any attempt to force French nationals to apply for visas</a> or work permits, as Rudd has since suggested, would be seen as a \u201chostile act\u201d. </p> <p>Bullish statements on fast-track bilateral trade deals by the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, have not gone down well on the continent either, where some feel Britain is actively working against the EU \u2013 currently struggling to seal its Canada trade deal \u2013 before it has even left the bloc.<br></p> <p>So May\u2019s views on the topics that are up for discussion in Brussels \u2013 trade, immigration, security, defence, Russia \u2013 will be listened to attentively.

Table-thumping, or modest? </p> <p>This may be her first summit and Brexit may not be up for discussion, but how the British prime minister comes across this week could prove critical to how smoothly the negotiations, which will start before the end of March, proceed. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 October 2016 to clarify a mistranslated reference to free trade in a quote from an EU diplomat.</p>",
