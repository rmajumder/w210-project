  "<p>Theresa May is under massive cross-party pressure to grant MPs a vote on any decision to leave or limit UK involvement in the European single market, amid growing outrage at the prospect that parliament could be bypassed over the biggest economic decision in decades.</p> <p>Tory MPs joined forces with former leaders of Labour and the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and Greens to insist that parliament have a say and a vote, pointing out that, while the British people had backed leaving the EU, they had not chosen to leave the biggest trading market in the western world.</p> <p>Former Labour leader Ed Miliband held discussions with pro-EU Tory MPs on Saturday, and was said to be considering tabling an urgent question in the Commons, demanding that May appear before parliament to explain its future role in Brexit decisions, when MPs return on Monday.</p> <p>The SNP and pro-EU Tory MPs Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry were also considering tabling questions, while former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, now the party\u2019s Brexit spokesman, said it would be appalling if detailed terms of Brexit, including the UK\u2019s future relations with the single market, were not voted on by MPs.</p> <p>Miliband told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cHaving claimed that the referendum was about returning sovereignty to Britain, it would be a complete outrage if May were to determine the terms of Brexit without a mandate from parliament.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no mandate for hard Brexit, and I don\u2019t believe there is a majority in parliament for [it] either. Given the importance of these decisions for the UK economy \u2026 it has to be a matter for MPs.\u201d</p> <p>Clegg said: \u201cMy great worry is that while there will be a vote on repealing the 1972 European Communities Act, which is about the decision to leave the EU, it will be left to the executive alone to decide the terms of Brexit. That would not be remotely acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>The extraordinary cross-party alliance has formed since ministers made a succession of speeches at the Tory party conference in Birmingham last week, which left the clear impression they would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\" title=\"\">press ahead with a hard Brexit</a>. The suggestion was that this would mean leaving the single market if that was the cost of regaining control of the UK\u2019s borders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"578f5732ec71c22d1e56b4a0ecf4e0502f5523d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/578f5732ec71c22d1e56b4a0ecf4e0502f5523d7/0_27_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior shot of Houses of Parliament\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Extraordinary cross-party alliance has formed since Tory party conference in Birmingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Concern has also grown after business leaders, led by the Confederation of British Industry and EEF (formerly the Engineering Employers Federation), wrote an open letter to the prime minister, warning that a hard Brexit that failed to secure a close relationship with the single market should be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/business-leaders-urge-theresa-may-to-avoid-hard-brexit\" title=\"\">ruled out \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The letter says the terms on which the UK leaves the EU will be critical to the UK economy, jobs and future investment, while resorting to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/liam-fox-looks-to-wto-in-hint-at-hard-brexit-stance\" title=\"\">World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules</a> would leave 90% of UK trading in goods subject to new tariffs. This would mean an additional 20% in extra costs for the UK\u2019s food and drink industry and 10% for car producers.</p> <p>\u201cWe respect the result of the referendum, but the government must make sure that the terms of the deal to leave ensure stability, prosperity and improved living standards,\u201d the business groups say.</p> <p>MPs demanding a vote point out that the 2015 Tory manifesto made explicit that, while there would be an in/out referendum, membership of the single market would still be in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/10/uk-membership-european-single-market-worth-4-more-gdp-eu-referendum-economy\" title=\"\">country\u2019s best economic interests</a>. The manifesto said \u201cWe say: \u2018Yes to the single market\u2019\u201d, and that the party would safeguard the country\u2019s interests within it.</p> <p>May has only said there will be a vote on a repeal bill to remove the 1972 act from the statute book, and that parliament will be kept informed when possible on negotiations on the detailed terms. But there is no prospect of a vote on what form Brexit will take, nor the terms.</p> <p>Ministers, including chancellor Philip Hammond, have been at pains to stress that the government will seek the best possible \u201caccess\u201d to the single market.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s former shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, said: \u201cWe conclude from the Tory conference that they are waving the white flag on remaining in the single market before negotiations have even begun. If there is any move away from it, there should be consultation in parliament and a vote.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/norway-may-block-uk-return-to-european-free-trade-association\" title=\"\">Norway is a member of the single market</a> but not a member of the EU and has to pay into its budget and accept free movement rules.</p> <p>Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas said: \u201cThe assumption that those who voted to leave were also signalling their wish to withdraw from the single market is unfounded. And for a government whose own manifesto commits it to continued membership of the single market, to now seek to overturn that and reinterpret the referendum result, while denying people a say through a vote in parliament, is a constitutional outrage.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, the referendum result must be honoured \u2013 but the vote was to leave the EU, not to inflict the greatest possible damage to our economy and tear apart community cohesion. \u201d</p> <p>David Cameron\u2019s former policy guru condemned May and her government for the direction she is taking the country in over Brexit. Steve Hilton, who broke with the former PM to back Brexit, was scathing about home secretary Amber Rudd\u2019s suggestion to make firms list the number of foreign workers they employ. Ministers might as well announce that \u201cforeign workers will be tattooed with numbers on their forearms\u201d, he wrote in the <em>Sunday Times</em>.</p> <p>At the Tory conference, May said a Great Repeal bill would be put forward in the Queen\u2019s speech next spring and would be voted on in the next session of parliament, coming into force on the day of exit. Ministers insist they cannot give a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on the details of negotiations.</p> <p>A No 10 source said: \u201cAs the prime minister said in her conference speech, we\u2019re getting on with the job of delivering Brexit, and we\u2019re going to make a success of it. Building relationships is absolutely essential in this business and putting in the hard yards in this way means Theresa will be one of the best travelled PMs by the time she meets everyone at her first European council meeting next month.\u201d</p> <p>A source at the Department for Exiting the European Union said: \u201cParliament voted by six to one to give people the final say on EU membership in the referendum held on 23 June. While there can therefore be no attempt to keep Britain in the EU by the back door, we have been clear that parliament will be consulted and engaged throughout the process of exit.</p> <p>\u201cWe will introduce a Great Repeal bill to end the authority of EU law and we have been clear that we will follow all the constitutional and legal precedents that apply to any treaty on a new relationship with the EU.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The Home Office has refused to respond to official requests from the French authorities to accept unaccompanied child refugees stranded in Calais who are eligible to come to Britain, the British Red Cross has said.</p> <p>With the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/24/france-calais-refugees-migrants-reception-centres-francois-hollande\">planned demolition</a> of Calais\u2019s refugee camp only weeks away, the Red Cross says the Home Office is turning down \u201ctake charge\u201d requests by the French on often pedantic grounds.

It accuses the Home Office of unnecessarily forcing vulnerable children to stay in the camp for months after their case is rejected because of a basic administrative error or lack of documents.</p> <p>\u201cInsufficient discretion or consideration is made for the child\u2019s vulnerability and circumstances,\u201d says the report, No Place For Children, released on Sunday.</p> <p>Despite more than a record 10,000 refugees being stranded in the Calais camp, the report found that in August the French had only three ad hoc administrators and one coordinator, all volunteers, to identify and start processing the claims of unaccompanied minors.</p> <p>The Red Cross recommends that UK officials should be based in Calais to help identify and process cases as a matter of urgency. At the start of last week, the Home Office had yet to send an official delegation to identify eligible child refugees and assist their claims.

She said: \u201cThe situation has been urgent for months and now we are reaching crisis point \u2013 the political stalemate between Paris and London has to stop.

Even in these cases, charities accuse the Home Office of not helping, saying that the process and legal costs have been paid by voluntary organisations and lawyers working pro bono.</p> <p>At least 178 unaccompanied children have been identified in the Calais camp as having family ties to the UK, with more than another 200 eligible to come to Britain under a separate scheme, an amendment to the Immigration Act <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/david-cameron-concessions-syrian-child-refugees\">put forward by Lord Dubs</a>.

Although it is widely accepted that there are traffickers in the camp, only 50 places for asylum-seeking children are available at nearby French centres.</p> <p>Alex Fraser, director of refugee support at the British Red Cross, the largest provider of support to refugees and asylum seekers in the UK, said: \u201cChildren, who could be rebuilding their lives in safety with their only surviving relatives, are being left to fend for themselves in conditions unimaginable to most adults.</p> <p>\u201cWith the forthcoming evictions in Calais, these bureaucratic problems are now more pressing than ever. We need to see urgency from both the UK and French governments. Children with a legal right to be here should be on the Eurostar across the Channel, not being dispersed somewhere else in France.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cIt is wholly false to say that we have not accepted responsibility for asylum applications submitted by the French authorities for unaccompanied children with family members in the UK. We have made crystal clear our commitment to fulfilling our obligations under the Dublin regulation.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In Crieff on Friday morning on the second day of the annual conference of Scotland\u2019s local authorities an otherwise unremarkable panel session took place to discuss local government reform. In the middle of the proceedings, Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dems\u2019 leader who always looks like a small-town bank manager about to admonish an old customer for his prodigal spending habits, threw out a challenge to the audience. \u201cAre there any SNP members here who want to put a question of the government,\u201d he asked.</p> <p>The government was represented on the panel by Derek Mackay, the recently appointed finance minister. To the surprise of no one in the room the silence of the grave rapidly descended. There were plenty of SNP members present but, as everyone in Scottish politics knows, any nationalists who valued a future in the party would rather go dooking for chips in a deep fat fryer than question its financial husbandry. Rennie\u2019s interjection was timely and pertinent. In a Scotland dominated by the SNP on every political level the task of maintaining the daily conduct of democracy, the practice of holding central government to account, falls a little more heavily on the shoulders of those party members who have been elected to office. Rennie\u2019s challenge to the SNP faithful came just a few hours after it had been announced that <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14787827.SNP_by_election_victory_in_Labour_heartland_signals_power_shift_in_Glasgow/?ref=rl&amp;lp=2\">their party had taken the council ward of Garscadden and Scotstounhill</a> in the north-west of Glasgow.</p> <p>This area, long a Labour stronghold, was furiously contested as each side sensed that the outcome would act as a weathervane pointing to the overall outcome of next May\u2019s local authority elections. The SNP have coveted control of Glasgow city council since they came to power nationally in 2007. At the 2012 local elections the SNP were just beginning to break out the champagne in Glasgow when it was announced that Labour, against all the odds and the prevailing nationalist headwind, had managed to hold on to the most prized of its municipal jewels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/scotland-bans-underground-coal-gasification-ugc\">Scotland bans controversial gas extraction technique</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since then though, all the indications have suggested that the SNP has virtually annexed the city. In 2014, Glasgow was only one of four Scottish local authority areas to vote Yes in the independence referendum. The following year, every one of the city\u2019s seven Westminster seats fell to the SNP, in the fierce after-shock of the constitutional division. And although Labour recovered a little lost ground in Glasgow in this year\u2019s Holyrood elections, the momentum is firmly with the nationalists. If they do take Glasgow then their writ will effectively run in every important area of Scotland. This is why Rennie\u2019s challenge is such a pertinent one.</p> <p>Tories have made much of their elevation to become the official opposition at Holyrood and there has been much silly talk about the emergence of their leader Ruth Davidson as a credible future first minister. In reality though, Davidson has been a major disappointment at Holyrood. She has failed adequately to distance herself from the hard right, which has annexed the UK Conservative party at Westminster with its sinister anti-immigration views. Her policy programme begins and ends with opposing a second referendum in independence. She charges the SNP with obsessing about independence; in truth though, no one is more obsessed by it than she and it has made her position as leader of the opposition faintly ridiculous.</p> <p>It is virtually certain that the government of Scotland will remain in the hands of the SNP for a generation, yet already this party is beginning to fall into the same bad habits that finally did for Labour in Scotland. They talk a great deal but so far have delivered little. At the local authority conference, Mackay, whose performance was described as lacklustre and predictable, could only say that people had to be prepared to pay more if they wanted improved public services. Not a scintilla of fresh or innovative thinking in funding models, which the much-lauded community empowerment bill might have been expected to open up.</p> <p>Mackay was saying this even as it was being revealed that the NHS 24 computer project has experienced a <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14787758.Future_of_NHS_24_in_doubt_as_crisis_hit_IT_project_costs_soar_by_73_/\">73% hike in cost to more than \u00a3130m</a>. Elsewhere it was revealed that <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14787747.Crisis_hit_Scots_NHS_board_has__no_plan__to_deal_with___11_6m_budget_deficit__says_auditor/\">NHS Tayside needs to make \u00a358m of savings</a> following years of government bail-outs. ScotRail, the national rail operator has long been a national disgrace. Last week it was revealed that its Dutch owners Abellio has admitted making <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14762449.Abellio_making___1_million_profit_a_month_from_ScotRail_franchise/\">so much money from the deal</a> that it can plough the profits back into its Netherlands operation. Despite all of this, the SNP have become politically untouchable. Yet Labour is in no position to land a single blow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/06/hard-brexit-could-see-scotland-lose-80000-jobs-and-cost-2000-a-head\">Hard Brexit could cost Scotland \u00a32,000 a head and 80,000 jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No matter how you try to crunch the numbers from Thursday\u2019s by election they convey disquietude for Labour. Certainly, the turnout at 24% was ridiculously low and the margin of victory slim, but it still represented a 20% swing to the SNP. In 2012, Labour gained 60% of the city vote. If the SNP do take Glasgow next year it will be less of a testament to its popularity and competence than the utter failure of Scottish Labour to engage at any level with voters. They really ought not to be losing so much ground in Scotland\u2019s biggest city. The SNP\u2019s antipathy to Glasgow is both real and historic.</p> <p>This city, which has suffered disproportionately from re-drawn local authority boundaries and health inequality, continues to drive Scotland\u2019s economy. Yet the SNP annually cuts its Holyrood block grant while throwing a third of Scotland\u2019s overall budget at a failing health service, which excels only at the rate at which it has increased managerialism and secured the financial futures of the children of thousands of NHS executives. Glasgow is lamentably under-represented at cabinet level in the SNP government. The neglect of Glasgow by the SNP should be on every Labour councillor seeking re-election next May.</p> <p>On 10 October, Glasgow will reveal its blueprint for thriving in the face of Brexit uncertainty. The theme of this fightback document will be Glasgow is Open For Business. It\u2019s not dissimilar to London\u2019s response but it doesn\u2019t have the vast riches that make it easier for the English capital. If Glasgow can convey and then maintain a sense of optimism in the face of Brexit and of deploying its gifts for innovation laughing in the face of adversity the SNP threat may yet be put to flight.</p>",
  "<p>Britons have been asked to name their favourite mammal. A <a href=\"https://www.rsb.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Society of Biology</a> (RSB) poll, launched on Sunday, will&#xa0;seek to pinpoint which non-domestic creature \u2013 found within our shores and coastal waters \u2013 is closest to the nation\u2019s heart. Candidates include the water vole, highland wildcat, fox, bottlenose dolphin, red squirrel and soprano pipistrelle bat.</p> <p>The poll, set up as part of Biology Week, which began on Saturday, is aimed at finding out what British people value most in the environment. \u201cPeople act on what they care about, so it\u2019s not just fun to explore their preferences and preconceptions, it\u2019s useful too,\u201d said Professor David Macdonald, director of Oxford University\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit. \u201cWe already know that the global favourites are big cats, and that knowledge can mobilise conservation campaigns \u2013 so let\u2019s find out which UK mammal people most want to champion.\u201d</p> <p>Last year a similar competition organised by the RSB saw the buff-tailed bumblebee being named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/16/buff-tailed-bumblebee-voted-britains-favourite-insect\" title=\"\">the nation\u2019s favourite insect</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4f343b6cf412fb19ee6f6f7353316b053b368ab5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f343b6cf412fb19ee6f6f7353316b053b368ab5/455_799_1925_2407/800.jpg\" alt=\"water vole\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A british water vole eating blackberries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MikeMcken/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Britain is home to 101 species of mammal. Some are recent arrivals, others have had their homes here since the last ice age. All are eligible for consideration in the poll. \u201cThe grey squirrel arrived about 150 years ago and the American mink appeared in the 1920s,\u201d said Macdonald. \u201cBy contrast, rabbits go back to Roman times and the fallow deer to pre-Norman times. As far as I am concerned, if it has fur and four legs and you see it in a local field, then it\u2019s a British mammal.\u201d</p> <p>Most animals on the list are land animals with only a few exceptions. The tiny soprano pipistrelle (<em>Pipistrellus pygmaeus</em>) \u2013 one of 18 species of bat found in the UK \u2013 is widespread and can consume more than 3,000 insects in a night. In addition, the bottlenose dolphin (<em>Tursiops truncatus) </em>is found in several different parts of the country, including the sea off Wales and Scotland. Many of Britain\u2019s mammals are now endangered as natural habitats disappear and farming intensifies. The water vole, often confused with brown rats (Ratty of <em>The Wind in the Willows</em> was actually a water vole), is now one of the nation\u2019s fastest disappearing mammals.</p> <p>Once found in almost every waterway in England, Wales and Scotland, <em>Arvicola amphibius</em> has disappeared from 90% of its former sites. The hedgehog (<em>Erinaceus europaeus</em>) has suffered from a drastic decline for the same reason: loss of habitat. The hedgehog population is estimated to number less than 1 million, down from more than 30 million in the 1950s. One third of this loss is thought to have taken place in the past 10 years.</p> <p>By contrast, the highland wildcat has suffered catastrophic decline for a very different reason. <em>Felis silvestris</em> can breed with the domestic cat and is losing its genetic integrity as a result. Surveys suggest pure-bred wildcat numbers are now lower than 400.</p> <p>\u201cWhichever mammal you choose, it\u2019ll be bumping up against some inconvenient aspect of the 21st century and will need society\u2019s support to prosper,\u201d Macdonald said. \u201cFor a nation that widely encourages others to protect wildlife in their communities, let us practise what we preach by nurturing the wildlife in our own backyards.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dd7cc594d58225e933a47c7a8c596bf09ef37e8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd7cc594d58225e933a47c7a8c596bf09ef37e8b/229_131_2869_1721/1000.jpg\" alt=\"red squirrel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A red squirrel, a species that has suffered since the introduction of the American grey squirrel in the 1870s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fazer44/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not every favourite candidate on the mammal poll list is doing badly. After the ban on otter hunting in 1978, along with a general improvement in water quality in rivers, numbers of otters (<em>Lutra lutra)</em> have slowly risen. The beaver (<em>Castor fiber</em>) has rebounded after becoming extinct, due to intense hunting, in the 16th century. Small numbers were reintroduced and the beaver is now a re-established UK resident \u2013 and a poll candidate.</p> <p>Finally there is the red fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) which has also thrived in recent years, spreading into urban areas and settling in large numbers. The animal is considered a pest in many areas, both in the country and the city. Nevertheless it is Macdonald\u2019s personal favourite to win the favourite mammal accolade for Britain. \u201cThey are beautiful, adaptable opportunists. Yes, they can be pests, but when you see one and catch the amber sparkle of their eyes, I defy anyone to find any animal in this country that is more lovely.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.rsb.org.uk/get-involved/biologyweek/favourite-uk-mammal\" title=\"\"><em>Register the vote at: rsb.org.uk/UKMammalPoll</em></a></p>",

The undercutting of wages and social tensions have been greatly exaggerated; those most hostile to immigration live in largely migrant-free areas; we are not in passport-free Schengen.</p> <p>Sadly, the Remainers, as with major party leaders over many years, failed to make the case for immigration, allowing decades of tabloid fear-mongering, Ukip racist poison and Brexiter populism to dictate the narrative. Corbyn has made a good start. We now need a high-profile, cross-party alliance, engaging academia, business, trade unions, faith communities and civil society, to fight for diverse, multicultural Britain and for free movement.<br><strong>Gideon Ben-Tovim</strong><br>Senior fellow in sociology<br>University of Liverpool</p> <p>Will Hutton concludes his lament for the effects of Brexit by noting that in many countries there is a significant barrier to constitutional change, but that previously, in Britain \u201cthe constitution interests only obsessives\u201d. I\u2019ll plead guilty to that: my opposition to the \u201cEuropean project\u201d has always been a constitutional one.</p> <p>Our European friends \u2013 I use the word deliberately \u2013 have always been more aware of constitutional issues, having had far more experience of constitutional change and the damage that weak or misguided constitutional arrangements can have, up to and contributing to war and devastation.</p> <p>I do not blame them for seeking a new constitutional disposition that promises a better future and they have been much more open about it and not pretended that the EU is really an economic arrangement. In Britain, the need especially for, ultimately, a European superstate has seemed much less obvious, so, from the 1960s on, politicians have had to pretend that it is about something else.<br><strong>John Old</strong><br>Nuneaton</p> <p>William Keegan is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/02/corbynistas-may-have-majority-but-brexiters-dont\" title=\"\">entitled to his view</a> but as an <em>Observer</em> reader who voted to leave the EU, I am a little tired of being told that I didn\u2019t really know what I was voting for. Even more irritating is the claim that Britain didn\u2019t really vote to leave as only 37% of those entitled to vote voted Leave. Last week, Mr Keegan claimed that in reality it is more likely that it is only 25% who wish to leave.</p> <p>Apart from this disingenuous use of statistics, what would he have claimed if the vote had been the other way round: that Britain had not voted to stay because only 37% of those entitled to vote had voted Remain? Of course not. He would be claiming victory for the Remainers and doubtless objecting to any claiming the contrary. I must say that I was hoping for a significant majority either way so that this sort of carping would not continue from either side. The closeness of the result means that isn\u2019t happening, but the fact is that there was a majority for leaving so let\u2019s get on with making a success of that. I for one acknowledge the difficulties but am confident in the future outside the EU.<br><strong>Ian Langworthy</strong><br>Huntingdon</p>",
  "<p>Stephen Daldry\u2019s 2000 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/billy-elliot\" title=\"\"><em>Billy Elliot</em></a> was a Bafta-winning critical and commercial hit. His 2005 stage musical version of the story about a working-class boy who wants to be a ballet dancer has been seen by 11 million people. His production of <em>An Inspector Calls</em>, JB Priestley\u2019s thriller of social conscience, has scooped armfuls of awards and is the National Theatre\u2019s longest-running show.</p> <p>Wondrously, both stage shows are still going strong today, with the touring production of Priestley\u2019s 70-year-old drama about a mystery visitor who unravels a family\u2019s secrets returning to the <a href=\"http://aninspectorcalls.com/\" title=\"\">West End next month</a>. It is now the longest-running revival in theatrical history. Yet any suggestion that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/stephen-daldry\" title=\"\">Daldry</a> has become a phenomenon akin to Andrew Lloyd Webber, an impresario who maintains a fleet of enduring stage hits in a variety of venues, is not welcome. Daldry wants to be more troublesome, less mainstream, than that.</p> <p>Next month he will have another go at rocking the cultural boat. Not content with an esteemed career in the world of film, making <em>The Hours</em> and <em>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</em>, or a recent theatrical triumph on both sides of the Atlantic with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/05/the-audience-review-helen-mirren\" title=\"\"><em>The Audience</em></a>, the play with Helen Mirren as the Queen, the 56-year-old has now created the most expensive television drama of all time \u2013 and possibly the most ambitious.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/21/different-kind-of-royal-fever-victoria-the-crown-jenna-coleman\" title=\"\"><em>The Crown</em></a>, telling the story of Elizabeth II from 1947 to the present day, will launch on 4 November on Netflix and has already been hailed by critics as the television drama series that will blast through established viewing habits, drawing older audiences away from traditional channels. Awarded five stars by reviewers on the <em>Times</em> and the <em>Telegraph</em>, it is a forensic examination of the politics and personal dramas negotiated by the royal family and, at a rumoured cost of \u00a3100m, marks the American subscription service\u2019s big push into new audiences. \u201cThey are expanding, both in the number of people who are subscribing, and into territories like Australia and India. I assume that is why they responded to our request,\u201d said Daldry. One of the \u201cgreat joys\u201d, he adds, of working for Netflix is the creative freedom. \u201cThere were no anxieties in the area of editorial control, not that we set out to do a hatchet job on the royal family by any stretch of the imagination.\u201d</p> <p>The atmosphere at the production\u2019s Elstree base has been close to a backstage theatrical experience, he says, puffing cigarette smoke enthusiastically over the roof of the Young Vic theatre in London, where he is advising on Isango Ensemble\u2019s new show, <em>A Man of Good Hope</em>. \u201cNetflix have been a fantastic company to work for. I have never been in a more convivial and happy production team. There are no commercial breaks for viewers and they don\u2019t tell us how long to make the thing either.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"23049019d9cf46eea00e8f0a135824dd5a003e87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23049019d9cf46eea00e8f0a135824dd5a003e87/36_0_3296_4120/800.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Daldry.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Daldry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether <em>The Crown</em> is the show that changes the game or not, Daldry believes subscription television is the likely future of entertainment: \u201cWho wants to got to the cinema on a Friday night now? You might get certain break-out movies, but online streaming of drama has altered the whole thing. You can subscribe and see 40 TV shows, or go out to the cinema for a night for the same money.\u201d</p> <p>Daldry might seem like a creative nomad, moving on from one medium and from one theme to another, but it is possible to spot the social concerns that crop up in his work. Both Priestley\u2019s morality puzzle and <em>The Crown</em> are rooted in postwar Britain. Although the play is set before the first world war, it was first performed in London at the New Theatre, now the No\u00ebl Coward, at the moment the young Princess Elizabeth was preparing for marriage. It is an era the director says he finds hard to view as a \u201cperiod\u201d setting. Instead, he says that both the venerable stage play and his new television series, written by Peter Morgan, strive to represent the real world we live in, rather than a past where \u201cthey do things differently\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNeither of them are really like costume dramas,\u201d Daldry says. \u201cWith <em>The Crown</em> we are attentive to detail, but it is not one of those dramas where you look at the dresses. I hope it doesn\u2019t feel like one of those.\u201d As with <em>An Inspector Calls</em>, the issues in <em>The Crown</em> feel contemporary, to say nothing of the bad language (the King swears at full throttle in the first five minutes) or of the focus on gritty subjects such as Anthony Eden\u2019s drug addiction.</p> <p>Daldry says he does not watch costume drama. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. I am not knocking it. I haven\u2019t seen ITV\u2019s <em>Victoria</em> yet. I did try to watch <em>Downton</em> on an aeroplane, but it is not really my thing.\u201d</p> <p>What he does find interesting, he says, is the anthropology of class, of royalty and of the church.</p> <p>\u201cPriestley wrote <em>An Inspector Calls</em> as part of that huge shift in postwar consensus, the wakening of a social conscience. He wrote it as political agitation, so people would not go back to Edwardian values, and when we first did it Margaret Thatcher was talking about returning to prewar values. Whenever you watch the play it seems to be politically relevant. It feels urgent in different ways. I first intended the chorus who come on carrying bundles to be the people of 1945, but when we did it in Dartford at the beginning of the year they suddenly looked like dispossessed refugees.\u201d</p> <p>It is odd revisiting a show he directed 24 years ago, Daldry says. \u201cI am now in my late 50s and am wondering whether I would do the audacious risk-taking now.\u201d He wonders if he might have been harder on the royals then: \u201cI have more respect because I know so much more now. Who knew Prince Philip (played by Matt Smith ) was a radical reformer who really did want to modernise them?\u201d</p> <p>Morgan and Daldry\u2019s original idea, born of their work on <em>The Audience</em>, was to \u201ccontinue the study of a family that weren\u2019t born to be the royal family of England and look at all the tensions and trials they go through\u201d. Daldry found it extraordinary just how much of their lives were discussed in cabinet sessions. \u201cOur rule was that the TV show would be about everything that became a constitutional crisis, not just the aborted engagement of Princess Margaret, but it broadened out a bit. We have fantastic researchers on the show, but we have deliberately had no contact with the palace. We always know when we are departing from the absolute truth, and of course no one knows the dialogue, so what you get of course is an imaginative interpretation. Peter describes it as <em>The Sopranos</em> meets <em>The West Wing</em>.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I haven't seen ITV's Victoria yet.

With 10 episodes of the first season of <em>The Crown</em> made, he is working on season two in Hungary, where Budapest will stand in for Germany and viewers will meet Prince Philip\u2019s family (many married to Nazis).</p> <p>Aside from the Young Vic show, and the work with the three new cast members joining <em>An Inspector Calls</em> for the West End run, he is in New York frequently. Not only do his children go to school there, he is working on two high-profile arts building projects, Pier 55 and the new performance centre on the site of Ground Zero. He has also just returned from a UN assembly \u201cglobal exchange\u201d session, which he attended with fellow members of the board of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/19/calais-refugee-camp-theatre-british-playwrights\" title=\"\">Good Chance</a> theatre company, working with people in the Calais refugee camp.</p> <p>Rather than being overstretched, Daldry is, he claims, \u201cthrilled by all the connections\u201d he sees in his varied projects. While the play at the Young Vic deals with the violent reaction to the Somali refugee crisis in South Africa, the director is also working in a climate heavily weighted with reaction to refugees who have flown in the other direction, north to Europe. \u201cAt the moment <em>Billy Elliot</em> is getting an incredible response in Edinburgh when the show talks about the collapse of community or the attack on union rights. People yell out. I love it when <em>An Inspector Calls</em> feels radical too. Sometimes people applaud in unexpected places.\u201d</p> <p>Finding quite such a radical resonance in his next film project, <em>Wicked: The Movie</em>, may be a bigger ask, but Daldry may well try.</p> <h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2> <p><strong>An Inspector Calls 1992</strong><br>Daldry\u2019s production of Priestley\u2019s play for the National Theatre is still going.

  "<p>Words do things to people. And the most potent words, the ones that have a direct line to the emotions, are profanity. Profane words uniquely allow you to express pain or cause it in others. They peerlessly demonstrate frustration, anger or emphasis. But let\u2019s be specific. I mean words such as cocksucker. Or fuck.</p> <p>These are among the taboo words of English that elicit the strongest measurable physiological reactions \u2013 the fastest pulse, the sweatiest palms, the shallowest breath. These words are versatile. Name a feeling and profanity can elicit it. Profanity can increase sexual arousal. It can increase your ability to withstand pain (compare the analgesic effect of yelling \u201cfuck!\u201d when you hammer your thumb with the effect of yelling \u201cduck!\u201d).</p> <p>When deployed appropriately, profanity can cause delight; countless comedians stake their professional lives on the impact of \u201cworking blue\u201d. But when miscalibrated, the use of the very same words can make you seem crude, uneducated or out of control. In their darkest incarnation, profane words can be part of verbal abuse and they can denigrate and disempower people. (See Trump\u2019s \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d.) And because these words have such an outsize impact, we ban them. We chastise children for using them and fine or arrest adults who use them around children. Because the words are just too powerful.</p> <p>What makes a word profane? Looking at English as it manifests itself across the world, we see hints of both consistency and variability. English profanity tends to be drawn from four categories of words. The word profanity originally referred to the first group. In Latin, <em>profanus</em> literally means \u201coutside the temple\u201d, denoting words or acts that desecrate the holy.</p> <p>For some people, the use of religious words in secular ways constitutes blasphemy \u2013 a sin against religious doctrine \u2013 and this is the pathway that makes those terms taboo. The names of religious figures, such as Jesus Christ, Jehovah or Muhammad, are easy fodder. So are aspects of religious dogma. In English, we have a few of these, such as holy, hell, God, damn. There are also older English curse words that have fallen out of favour, such as \u201cgadzooks\u201d, from God\u2019s hooks (the nails used in the Crucifixion). The first place English profanity originates is the sacred.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For contemporary English speakers, the worst words are derogatory terms  based on their ethnicity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The second is in language relating to sex and sexual acts. This includes the acts themselves, sex organs, people who perform those acts and artefacts and effluvia related to those acts. So the second prong of our profanity principle is sex.</p> <p>Third is language involving other bodily functions \u2013 things that come out of your body, the process of expelling them and the parts of your body they come out of. This includes robust cohorts of words describing faeces, urine and vomit, among others, as well as the associated body parts and the artefacts used in the upkeep of those body parts, such as douchebag.</p> <p>Finally there are the slurs. Among the most offensive words in the Anglophone world are words made offensive by dint of their derogatory reference to people based on a group they\u2019re perceived to belong to, defined in terms of sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion and so on.</p> <p>Looking just at English, you\u2019ll find that nearly all the most profane words in Great Britain, New Zealand and the United States fall into one of these four categories: praying, fornicating, excreting and slurring. Can this pattern be generalised? If it captures something about human nature or about the inevitable evolution of cultural systems, then you\u2019d expect it to apply broadly.</p> <p>Alternatively, English speakers might be a breed apart, uniquely obsessed with religion, copulation, bodily functions and social groups. If you pick your favourite language other than English, how does profanity work? What\u2019s profane in Cantonese? How about Finnish? Pretty well. Most of the profane vocabulary in most languages that have accessible documentation is drawn from one of these four categories. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t local exceptions. One is language about animals \u2013 calling someone a dog in Korea is deeply offensive, for example. Disease often creeps into profanity and a salient example is Dutch, which counts among its strong profanities words for cancer, typhoid and tuberculosis. But for the most part, when a language and culture designate a stable set of words as profane \u2013 where the words themselves are deemed inappropriate and offensive \u2013 these largely fall into the four categories.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ec4c04546c35ca98b2db4d0fedf7a6cd68ab6ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ec4c04546c35ca98b2db4d0fedf7a6cd68ab6ad/0_88_2316_1389/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Korea, calling someone a dog is deeply offensive.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Korea, calling someone a dog is deeply offensive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Rayner/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Curiously, though, not all languages hew to the principle in the same proportions. Quebecois French makes heavy use of what it calls <em>sacres</em> (\u201cconsecrations\u201d): strong profanities related to Catholicism and Catholic liturgical concepts. Far stronger than <em>merde</em> (\u201cshit\u201d) or <em>foutre </em>(\u201cfuck\u201d) in Quebec are <em>tabarnack</em> (\u201ctabernacle\u201d), <em>calisse </em>(\u201cchalice\u201d) and <em>calvaire</em> (\u201cCalvary\u201d). This is despite, or due to, the fact that Quebeckers have largely lost their religion. Sexual language is more pervasive. A good example is Cantonese, which uses words for the act of copulation like <em>diu </em>or relevant body parts, as its strongest terms.</p> <p>But not English. The bulk of the words that contemporary native speakers consider worst are derogatory terms for individuals or groups, especially ones based on their ethnicity. In English, these slurs are not only based on ethnicity but also on sexual orientation, immigration status and health condition.</p> <p>Ultimately, two things are clear. First, languages tend to draw from similar domains for their profanity. That suggests that the forces that make words become profane in English may be present across human experience, regardless of native language. And second, despite similarities across languages, cultural idiosyncrasies do play a role in shaping how profanity in a language will work and be distributed. Languages spoken by people with a cultural history of uniform religious practice (for instance, Catholicism) can become populated with holy profanity \u2013words for heaven and hell and saints and demons. If you were clever, you might even say that when it comes to cultural differences in profanity, the devil is in the detail. Or maybe not.</p> <p><em>Benjamin Bergen is professor of cognitive science, University of San Diego, and author of </em>What The F: What Swearing Reveals about Our Language, Our Brains and Ourselves</p>",

Many Italians work in the UK, to find a job Italy is not offering them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb8e95871dc3fa779dd336c04eed53cc13b04054\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb8e95871dc3fa779dd336c04eed53cc13b04054/0_103_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"EU nationals picking lettuce on a UK farm\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There are 2.1 million EU nationals employed in the UK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Scrivener/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey worry, some are already packing. Brace yourself for some nasty payback should the Conservatives insist on this jingoism,\u201d he said. In Greece, at the coalface of the refugee crisis, the government deplored the rise of what it described as dangerous language. \u201cUkip, it seems, has contaminated the Tories with its \u2026 xenophobia. This is a very sad development for Britain and Europe,\u201d deputy minister for European affairs Nikos Xydakis told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>\u201cWe are seeing the extreme right pushing the mainstream agenda with its discourse and practices, its speech of hate, racism and fear,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is the core problem of Europe. It is a danger for peace and democracy and it is knocking at our door.\u201d</p> <p>An estimated 22,000 Greek students are in higher education in the UK, their parents often making huge sacrifices for the privilege. Greece also has a huge contingent of academics ensconced in teaching and research positions at British universities. Attracting foreign students \u2013 and foreign expertise in teaching and research \u2013 is a key source of revenue for British universities.</p> <p>Another well-beaten trail into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/apr/23/are-international-students-getting-a-raw-deal\">British institutions comes from India</a>, where people are now thinking twice about going to the UK, said Falguni Laheru, a solicitor at immigration law firm SmartMove4Visas. \u201c[Indians] have come to expect immigration updates with a mixture of unease and distress,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Jibes at foreigners have already cost Britain jobs, she said, pointing to two of her own clients who have just opted to set up new offices in the Netherlands and Germany respectively, as a direct result of visa restrictions there being unlikely to change.</p> <p>\u201cAll the qualified workers now prefer migrating to Canada, Australia and New Zealand,\u201d she said. \u201cThe feeling of our highly skilled clients is that while the UK needs our skills, we do not feel wanted.\u201d</p> <p>In 2013, when then prime minister David Cameron led a trade delegation to India, he gave a TV interview saying the UK would be \u201cincredibly welcoming\u201d to Indians who wanted to study in the UK. The interview was interpreted as Cameron suggesting conscientious, hardworking Indians were the right kind of immigrant for the UK.</p> <p>Rahul Chatterjee, who has now decided to apply to US universities for his postgraduate degree, said Britain needs highly skilled immigrant labour from India. \u201cIf I were a blue-collar worker, and I saw other people, foreigners, getting jobs, and I wasn\u2019t getting one, I\u2019d be pretty ticked off too. If that is the case. But obviously some people lack the kind of education to understand the economic benefits immigrants bring.</p> <p>\u201cThe US allows students to work anywhere in the country for one year after completing an undergrad degree. So you can see why many students prefer that. Politicians like Amber Rudd and Theresa May know economically that they need foreign guys to drive down prices, but the stuff they say is to appeal to public sentiment.\u201d</p> <p>Ashmita Lucktoo, editor of <em>NRI World</em>, a magazine for expat Indians, said people felt hurt by the rising anti-immigrant talk. \u201cThe UK used to be the golden bird of the world, they used to rule India, and now they\u2019re not on top any more, so there\u2019s an inferiority complex, especially with regard to brown skin,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cEven if you have a degree or skills, you\u2019re forced into menial jobs like working at Burger King or Starbucks. Indians are now under enormous pressure to succeed; if you\u2019re going to the UK, either you have to succeed and make it really big, or you may as well come home and have some dignity.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Not far from Mosul, a large military force is finalising plans for an advance that has been more than three decades in the making. The troops are Shia militiamen who have fought against the Islamic State, but they have not been given a direct role in the coming attack to free Iraq\u2019s second city from its clutches.</p> <p>Instead, while the Iraqi army attacks Mosul from the south, the militias will take up a blocking position to the west, stopping Isis forces from fleeing towards their last redoubt of Raqqa in Syria. Their absence is aimed at reassuring the Sunni Muslims of Mosul that the imminent recapture of the city is not a sectarian push against them. However, among Iraq\u2019s Shia-dominated army the militia\u2019s decision to remain aloof from the battle of Mosul is being seen as a rebuff.</p> <p>Yet among the militias\u2019 backers in Iran there is little concern. Since their inception, the Shia irregulars have made their name on the battlefields of Iraq, but they have always been central to Tehran\u2019s ambitions elsewhere. By not helping to retake Mosul, the militias are free to drive one of its most coveted projects \u2013 securing an arc of influence across Iraq and Syria that would end at the Mediterranean Sea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/tehran-zip/giv-1406XsQMElhEOca5\" data-alt=\"Iran's arc of influence\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/tehran-zip/giv-1406XsQMElhEOca5\">Iran's arc of influence</a> </figure>  <p>The strip of land to the west of Mosul in which the militias will operate is essential to that goal. After 12 years of conflict in Iraq and an even more savage conflict in Syria, Iran is now closer than ever to securing a land corridor that will anchor it in the region \u2013 and potentially transform the Islamic Republic\u2019s presence on Arab lands. \u201cThey have been working extremely hard on this,\u201d said a European official who has monitored Iran\u2019s role in both wars for the past five years. \u201cThis is a matter of pride for them on one hand and pragmatism on the other. They will be able to move people and supplies between the Mediterranean and Tehran whenever they want, and they will do so along safe routes that are secured by their people, or their proxies.\u201d</p> <p>Interviews during the past four months with regional officials, influential Iraqis and residents of northern Syria have established that the land corridor has slowly taken shape since 2014. It is a complex route that weaves across Arab Iraq, through the Kurdish north, into Kurdish north-eastern Syria and through the battlefields north of Aleppo, where Iran and its allies are prevailing on the ground. It has been assembled under the noses of friend and foe, the latter of which has begun to sound the alarm in recent weeks. Turkey has been especially opposed, fearful of what such a development means for Iran\u2019s relationship with the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party), the restive Kurds in its midst, on whom much of the plan hinges.</p> <p>The plan has been coordinated by senior government and security officials in Tehran, Baghdad and Damascus, all of whom defer to the head of the spearhead of Iran\u2019s foreign policy, the Quds force of the Revolutionary Guards, headed by Major General Qassem Suleimani, who has run Iran\u2019s wars in Syria and Iraq. It involves demographic shifts, which have already taken place in central Iraq and are under way in northern Syria. And it relies heavily on the support of a range of allies, who are not necessarily aware of the entirety of the project but have a developed vested interest in securing separate legs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e04c9b0d69d42544b5367b45b8fccac33853903c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e04c9b0d69d42544b5367b45b8fccac33853903c/0_96_4669_2802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maj Gen Qassem Suleimani\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maj Gen Qassem Suleimani, head of Iran\u2019s all-powerful Quds force.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The corridor starts at the entry points that Iran has used to send supplies and manpower into Iraq over the past 12 years. They are the same routes that were used by the Quds force to run a guerrilla war against US forces when they occupied the country \u2013 a campaign fought by the same Iraqi militias that have since been immersed in the fight against Isis.</p> <p>The groups, Asa\u2019ib ahl al-Haq, Keta\u2019ib Hezbollah and their offshoots, accounted for close to 25% of all US battlefield casualties, senior US officials have said. They have become even more influential since US forces left the country. And in one of modern warfare\u2019s starkest ironies, in the two years since US troops have returned to Iraq to fight Isis they have at times fought under US air cover.</p> <p>The route crosses through Baquba, the capital of Diyala province, around 60 miles north of Baghdad. A mixed Sunni/Shia area for hundreds of years, Diyala became one of the main sectarian flashpoint areas during Iraq\u2019s civil war. Along roads that have been secured by militias, which are known locally as \u201cpopular mobilisation units\u201d, it then moves northwest into areas that were occupied by Isis as recently as several months ago.</p> <p>The town of Shirqat in Salaheddin province is one important area. It was taken by militias along with Iraqi forces on 22 September, delivering another blow to the terrorist group and an important boost to Iran\u2019s ambitions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/01/observer-view-russian-actions-syria-influence-international-law\">The Observer view on Russia\u2019s actions in Syria and the failure of international law | Observer editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The militias are now present in large numbers in Shirqat and readying to move towards the western edge of Mosul, to a point around 50 miles southeast of Sinjar, which \u2013 at this point \u2013 is the next leg in the corridor. Between the militia forces and Sinjar is the town of Tal Afar, an Isis stronghold, which has been a historical home of both Sunni and Shia Turkmen \u2013 ancestral kin of Turkey.</p> <p>A senior intelligence official said the leg between Tel Afar and Sinjar is essential to the plan. Sinjar is an ancestral home to the Yazidi population, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/who-yazidi-isis-iraq-religion-ethnicity-mountains\">forced to flee in August 2014</a> after Isis invaded the city, killing all the men it could find and enslaving women. It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/13/tyranny-has-gone-kurds-and-yazidis-celebrate-recapture-of-sinjar-from-isis\">recaptured by Iraqi Kurdish forces last November</a>. And ever since PKK forces from across the Syrian border have taken up residence in the city and across the giant monolith, Mt Sinjar, behind it. The PKK fighters are being paid by the Iraqi government and have been incorporated into the popular mobilisation units. Iraqi and western intelligence officials say the move was approved by Iraq\u2019s national security adviser, Falah Fayadh.</p> <p>An influential Iraqi tribal sheikh, Abdulrahim al-Shammari, emerges as a central figure further to the north. He has a power base near the Rabia crossing into Syria, receives support from the popular mobilisation units and is close to the Assad regime in Damascus. \u201cI believe that in our area Iran does not have very much influence,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em> in Baghdad. \u201cThere is nobody here, no major power that is helping us with weapons. Ideologically speaking, the PKK is affiliated with the Kurds of this area, so there is no problem having them here.\u201d</p> <p>From the Rabia crossing, the mooted route goes past the towns of Qamishli and Kobani towards Irfin, which are all controlled by the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia. Throughout the war the YPG (People\u2019s Protection Units) has hedged its bets, at times allying with the US against Isis, and at other times siding with the Syrian regime. \u201cIran thinks it has them where it wants them now,\u201d said the European source. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it has gauged the Turks correctly, though.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52a1eea1fda30e13b01d3625055de2ff39d3b2c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52a1eea1fda30e13b01d3625055de2ff39d3b2c5/1472_95_2761_3452/800.jpg\" alt=\"A fighter in Sinjar\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fighter sits on a balcony in Sinjar, Iraq after the town was retaken from Isis by Kurdish-led forces.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cengiz Yar/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of all the points between Tehran and the Syrian coast, Aleppo has concentrated Iran\u2019s energies more than anywhere else. Up to 6,000 militia members, mostly from Iraq, have congregated there ahead of a move to take the rebel-held east of the city, which could begin around the same time as the assault on Mosul.</p> <p>Those who have observed Suleimani up close as he inspects the frontlines in Syria and Iraq, or in meetings in Damascus and Baghdad, where he projects his immense power through studied calm, say he has invested everything in Syria \u2013 and in ensuring that Iran emerges from a brutal, expensive war with its ambitions enhanced. \u201cIf we lose Syria, we lose Tehran,\u201d Suleimani told the late Iraqi politician Ahmed Chalabi in 2014. Chalabi told the <em>Observer</em> at the time that Suleimani had added: \u201cWe will turn all this chaos into an opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>Securing Aleppo would be an important leg in the corridor, which would run past two villages to the north that have historically been in Shia hands. From there, a senior Syrian official, and Iraqi officials in Baghdad, said it would run towards the outskirts of Syria\u2019s fourth city, Homs, then move north through the Alawite heartland of Syria, which a year of Russian airpower has again made safe for Assad. Iran\u2019s hard-won road ends at the port of Latakia, which has remained firmly in regime hands throughout the war.</p> <p>Ali Khedery, who advised all US ambassadors to Iraq and four commanders of Centcom in 2003-11 said securing a Mediterranean link would be seen as a strategic triumph in Iran. \u201cIt signifies the consolidation of Iran\u2019s control over Iraq and the Levant, which in turn confirms their hegemonic regional ambitions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat should trouble every western leader and our regional allies because this will further embolden Iran to continue expanding, likely into the Gulf countries next, a goal they have explicitly and repeatedly articulated. Why should we expect them to stop if they\u2019ve been at the casino, doubling their money over and over again, for a decade?\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The British diplomat who wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article-50\" title=\"\">article 50</a> has claimed that Theresa May should allow the people to vote on the final terms of Brexit, following a Tory party conference which he said had signalled a desire for a hard Brexit and caused consternation across continental Europe.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/28/david-cameron-britain-eu-accident\" title=\"\">Lord Kerr of Kinlochard</a> said it would be appropriate for a general election or referendum to be held on whether the government\u2019s deal lived up to Boris Johnson\u2019s optimism about negotiations. The foreign secretary said during the referendum campaign that in terms of limiting freedom of movement and retaining single market membership, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/22/no-boris-johnson-you-cant-have-your-brexit-cake-and-eat-it-too\" title=\"\">\u201cpro cake and pro eating it\u201d.</a></p> <p>Kerr, a former ambassador to the US and permanent representative to the EU, who in 2003 drafted the process by which two years of exit negotiations commences, said: \u201cOnce the government, some way down this process, has established clearly what Brexit will be like, if it turns out that Boris\u2019s policy on cake doesn\u2019t work, then it might not be a bad idea to ask the country in a general election, or possibly another referendum, whether this is actually what it had in mind.\u201d</p> <p>He said parliament might express the view: \u201c\u2018OK, start the process now and we hope you achieve the following things; if you fail to achieve them \u2013 and remember, in the referendum, you said you would achieve them \u2013 then we will want to see you again.\u2019 Everything changes in politics but, at the moment, I do [think that is appropriate].\u201d</p> <p>The crossbench peer, who advised Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair in EU negotiations, also suggested that the prime minister would allow parliament to vote on a motion on triggering article 50, and win with a big majority, even if two current legal cases in the high court, seeking to force the government into such a vote, failed.</p> <p>\u201cThe government seems confident it is going to win the cases; I don\u2019t know,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI suspect that even if the government does win them, it would provide for some sort of vote in parliament because it seems to be that it is risk-free, actually.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6409e3811cd31648d9f9b578b4af7998be3a8d46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6409e3811cd31648d9f9b578b4af7998be3a8d46/0_354_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May making her keynote speech to the Conservative party annual conference in Birmingham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May making her keynote speech to the Conservative party annual conference in Birmingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be on a bill if the government has won the case but it would, presumably, be on some sort of motion.\u201d</p> <p>Kerr added, however, that he believed that negotiations over the financial terms of exit would be \u201cnasty\u201d \u2013 and that the government had potentially made life harder for itself by upsetting politicians in EU member states with its rhetoric on immigration and its apparent intention to leave the single market and the customs union.</p> <p>He said that May was \u201cdefinitely signalling\u201d hard Brexit. \u201cThat may be because she is more frightened of the Brexiters in her party than she is of the soft Remainers who are clearly in full retreat at the moment.</p> <p>\u201cThat may change during the negotiations as it becomes clear that Boris\u2019s policy doesn\u2019t work \u2013 and things are going to be tougher. At that stage, the funders of the Tory party may start saying: \u2018Hang on, are we sure about this?\u2019 May\u2019s vision can change over time.\u201d</p> <p>Kerr, who admitted that he had not believed that article 50 would be triggered by any state when he drafted it, added of May\u2019s comments in Birmingham: \u201cIt has played very badly in continental Europe. There is some relief that she has given a drop-dead date for article 50 but everything else she said has caused consternation.\u201d</p> <p>Kerr, who was head of the diplomatic service until 2002, and at the heart of Britain\u2019s team during the Maastricht treaty negotiations in 1991, added that it was also a mistake for the UK not be in attendance at the recent EU summit in Slovakia. \u201cI would go about things a slightly different way,\u201d he said, \u201cI would do a bit more chatting them up. I would have gone to Bratislava for the recent meeting. I can\u2019t understand why we didn\u2019t. We should be there. The empty chair is a very bad policy.\u201d</p> <p>Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: \u201cLord Kerr confirms what the Liberal Democrats have been saying. Voting for a departure is not the same as voting for a destination. Theresa May\u2019s speech caused the pound to crash and the rest of Europe to harden its position.

Trump wears his misogyny as proudly as his hair. Feel it, he says, go on see if it\u2019s real. It\u2019s real enough. He is telling it like it is, this is how men are with women. There is no difference between truth and lies. There is only power and its constant neurotic need to reassert itself.</p> <p>His campaign is an anxiety performance. Machismo by its nature is always an exaggeration, an overcompensation. It works for losers precisely because it covers loss. Look, he says to the disempowered, white male, look at me and my phallic boasting. I will make you hard again.</p> <p>His hatred of women, his refusal of their bodily autonomy, whether over sex or reproductive rights, is not suddenly being revealed. This is his lifestyle. Now he has crossed a line apparently. Well, the line is a moveable feast when you can hint at assassinating your opponent, at the black vote being rigged, at interviewers menstruating. Multiple choice offence is his USP. Suck it up, bitches.</p> <p>And they do. Most senior Republicans have not withdrawn their endorsements. They just feel a bit queasy. Mostly because they have wives and daughters and stuff. Potential gropees. Poor men having their property tampered with. What a violation, but it\u2019s not the worst. You think I am joking? I have been to Republican rallies where the stickers read: \u201cMy wife yes, my dog maybe, my gun never.\u201d</p> <p>Hilarious!</p> <p>Now some of these guys think Trump has made unacceptable remarks. They must just mean \u201crecorded\u201d, as if saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">women are pigs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/02/donald-trump-racist-claims-mexico-rapes\">Mexicans are rapists</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/04/us-military-veterans-donald-trump-petition-john-mccain\">war vets are sissies</a> is just tickety-boo. They must sense and fear that Trump\u2019s strength depends on defining what is weak and negating it. Nothing then is off limits.</p> <p>The good guys are also out in force, telling us they don\u2019t speak about women like this and have never heard anything like it. They are forever respectful. Well respectfully, they should shut up and listen. I have heard men speak like this all my life. The idea that men are suddenly discovering misogyny because of Trump is somewhat strange. Where have they been?</p> <p>Trump is hardly the first entitled politico. Silvio Berlusconi and Dominque Strauss-Kahn bought the bodies of young women. Everyone at the IMF knew no woman could be alone with Strauss-Kahn. Westminster has its share of gropers and grabbers who know not what they do because they are \u201cdepressed\u201d. Men let other men off the hook or, when confronted, say they didn\u2019t realise the full extent of what was happening.</p> <p>So I would rather hear from women and they are all over Twitter telling of the first time they were sexually assaulted, some at eight, 11, 13. A brother\u2019s friend. A neighbour. A man on a bus.</p> <p>The first time is when you realise that your body is up for grabs, that the sexual pleasure taken from it does not belong to you. Sex is something that is done to you, not done by you. And if it hurts, just grow to like the pain. This is the culture I grew up in, it\u2019s the culture my daughters grow up in.</p> <p>This absolute refusal to say misogyny involves all men because it is a system by which the abuse of women acts as a guarantor of masculinity is part of the problem. Women have to modify their behaviour. Walk home that way, don\u2019t wear that, don\u2019t answer back, don\u2019t drink too much, don\u2019t post that selfie, smile before you run for your life. Believe it\u2019s not all men or your life would not be worth living.</p> <p>When one man speaks up applaud him. Here is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/13/robert-de-niro-donald-trump-is-totally-nuts\">Robert De Niro</a> who can\u2019t take it any more. But where are the other guys who have had this tape for a while? Why, as it features Billy Bush, did they not put it out when Jeb Bush was being hammered in the primaries? Why did we need a tape to find Trump abhorrent?</p> <p>Of course some women will continue to collude with these scumbags, they will vote for Trump, they will excuse him. Women are good at excusing men. If we weren\u2019t, the human race would die out. Some women will look away, believing men can\u2019t help it and carry on humouring the \u201cbanter\u201d. You drop something in a restaurant and a guy says: \u201cWhile you are down there love\u2026\u201d and you laugh because if you didn\u2019t you might stick a fork in his eye. And you remember being 14 and being bruised from mere \u201cgroping\u201d but thinking yourself lucky because the worst didn\u2019t happen. You think about how you knew the practice of misogyny long before you heard the theory, so wonder how the good guys are slightly baffled by it.</p> <p>But now with Trump, there is evidence. On a tape. Had they not heard the stories women tell? Yes, America could still elect the man <a href=\"http://blogs.bookforum.com/review/2015/08/05/will-the-real-american-psycho-please-stand-up-why-donald-trump-was-patrick-batemans-hero/\">idolised</a> by Patrick Bateman in <em>American Psycho</em>. For misogyny is not some secret society, a form of freemasonry. It is mainstream. It is endorsed by Trump. It is not simply unacceptable, it is murderous.</p> <p>Kill it dead.</p>",

Martin worked for the same NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, that employed the whistleblower <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden\">Edward Snowden</a>, but his own motive remains a mystery.</p> <p>Elizabeth Martin, a former police officer who now lives in Australia, told the New York Times in a phone interview: \u201cHe was one of the most patriotic people I knew.</p> <p>\u201cHe brought work home all the time \u2013 he was always on a laptop, always working, always studying,\u201d she said, adding that he had stacks of books and papers everywhere and was \u201ca bit of a hoarder\u201d.</p> <p>Her husband had no interest in politics and was interested mainly in computers, Martin told the paper, describing him as \u201ca genuinely nice guy \u2013 a little eccentric, but not in a bad way\u201d.</p> <p>NSA officials believe Martin had been taking home \u201ca staggering quantity\u201d of highly classified material in various formats since the 1990s, according to the Times report, but have been unable to link him directly to half a dozen leaks that have appeared on the internet over the past three years.

Roy Rada, a retired professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who mentored him during his early PhD research, told the Times Martin believed he had many of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, possibly a result of his service in Operation Desert Storm in Iraq.</p> <p>Martin is enrolled in the university\u2019s information systems graduate programme. The university partners with the NSA to provide opportunities for jobs, training and scholarship support.</p> <p>His arrest was not made public until Wednesday, when the justice department unsealed a criminal complaint that accused Martin of having been in possession of top secret information that could cause \u201cexceptionally grave danger\u201d to national security.</p> <p>According to an FBI affidavit accompanying the complaint: \u201cMartin at first denied, and later when confronted with specific documents, admitted he took documents and digital files from his work assignment to his residence and vehicle that he knew were classified. Martin stated that he knew what he had done was wrong and that he should not have done it because he knew it was unauthorised.\u201d <br></p> <p>The complaint does not specify which documents Martin is alleged to have taken or when he did so. He was arrested about the same time US officials acknowledged an investigation into a cyber leak of purported hacking tools used by the NSA to tamper with firewalls.</p> <p>Martin appeared in court on 29 August and remains in custody. If convicted, he would face a maximum of 11 years in prison. </p> <p>His lawyers, Jim Wyda and Deborah Boardman, said: \u201cThere is no evidence that Hal Martin intended to betray his country. What we do know is that Hal Martin loves his family and his country. He served honorably in the United States navy as a lieutenant and he has devoted his entire career to protecting his country. We look forward to defending Hal Martin in court.\u201d</p> <p>It is the second such high-profile case in three years, raising fresh questions about internal security at the NSA, particularly its ability to guard against an insider threat.</p> <p>Rajesh De, general counsel for the NSA when Snowden went public in the Guardian in June 2013, revealing the NSA\u2019s bulk collection of millions of Americans\u2019 phone records, told the Associated Press: \u201cOne key thing we don\u2019t have visibility into now is how he was caught, because that would provide some insight into whether the reforms that were put in post-Snowden were effective or not, or their relative efficacy.\u201d<br></p> <p>De added that it was unlikely \u201cyou\u2019re going to be able to stop every incident of somebody taking documents if they\u2019re determined to do so. But the real question is how quickly can you detect it, how quickly can you mitigate the harm of any such incident.\u201d</p> <p>The White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, said the government had reduced the number of people who need security clearances by 17% and enhanced the quality of background checks. A national insider threat taskforce has established government-wide minimum reforms to prevent the theft or unauthorised disclosure of sensitive information. </p> <p>\u201cSo this is certainly something that the administration takes seriously, and there are important lessons that we have learned since the case of Mr Snowden,\u201d Earnest told reporters. </p> <p>\u201cBut I think that this risk is always going to be there as long as there is a desire to share sensitive information across the government. And we know that there is a risk of not sharing that information.\u201d<br></p> <p>Adam Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House select committee on intelligence, said: \u201cI applaud the FBI for making an arrest, but it is painfully clear that the intelligence community still has much to do to institutionalise reforms designed to protect in advance the nation\u2019s sources and methods from insider threats.\u201d</p> <p>Defenders of Snowden have argued that he leaked top secret <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/washington-post-wrong-edward-snowden-pardon\">documents to journalists on principle</a>, believing the NSA was acting unconstitutionally by engaging in mass surveillance.

  "<p><strong>Before the referendum the <em>Observer</em> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/16/leave-or-remain-black-country-businessmen-argue-for-and-against-brexit\" title=\"\"><strong>spoke to two Midlands manufacturers on either side of the Brexit debate</strong></a><strong>. More than three months later the economic news is better than had been forecast, but the pound has tumbled. Here they report back on how the decision to leave has affected their Black Country businesses so far.</strong></p> <h2><strong>The Leaver</strong></h2> <p>Andrew Cox and most of his 25-strong workforce voted to leave. He wanted the UK to free itself from the constraints of EU membership and look further afield for export opportunities.</p> <p>Cox has just returned from trade shows in Poland where, between heated discussions with Polish friends over the UK\u2019s future, he has been taking a flurry of inquiries from potential clients. The pound is a big factor in that jump in demand. His company, Cox &amp; Plant, makes 70% of its \u00a37m annual turnover from exports. From a factory in Lye, it sells production-line machinery to food manufacturers around the world and the drop in sterling since the Brexit vote has just made that machinery a whole lot cheaper.</p> <p>\u201cThe volume of inquiries and quotations has gone through the roof. We have had three orders from America since the middle of August, all based on the fact that the pound is slumping against the dollar,\u201d says Cox.</p> <p>The pound\u2019s drop against the euro is similarly helpful. \u201cIn Poland, one of the guys said to me, \u2018this is the easiest 15% discount I have ever negotiated\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The domestic market is also improving. \u201cInitially, there was almost paralysis in the sector,\u201d says Cox. \u201cBut the home market has been very, very buoyant in the last seven weeks because the data started to filter through, people became more confident and people weren\u2019t going to the wall \u2013 and we didn\u2019t get Armageddon as forecast.\u201d</p> <p>The company buys a small proportion of its raw materials, such as stainless steel, from abroad and such imports have become more expensive with the pound\u2019s fall. But for Cox, the upsides of the weak pound have more than offset the downsides. Investment and hiring plans are on track.</p> <p>With the pound so low, Cox believes more UK businesses should be looking to increase exports. But in his experience as board director for exports on the Black Country local enterprise partnership (LEP), many companies lack the confidence to broach new markets and the government is not giving them enough support. \u201cThe Department for International Trade needs massive investment and it needs troops on the ground,\u201d he says.</p> <p>As for what he wants from Brexit, Cox wants easy market access to continue: \u201cThe worst scenario for me would be to go back to the nightmare paper trails that we used to have to do with exporting to Europe.\u201d</p> <p>On immigration, he worries politicians could push for rules that hamper the UK. \u201cI just hope things don\u2019t get silly \u2026 We have got some great talent in the UK and we\u2019ve got some great talent coming into the UK.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aba04c4487533be38933f026dc8929223c50ebe0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aba04c4487533be38933f026dc8929223c50ebe0/0_276_5622_3374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Cox and Simon Winfield\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cox and Winfield are both suffering from higher import costs, but to significantly differing degrees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Fox/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The Remainer</strong></h2> <p>Simon Winfield runs MacLellan Rubber, a 145-year-old business in Wednesfield supplying products such as seals and rubber matting to other manufacturers. He felt remaining in the EU and its market of 500 million people was the better option for his business, for the UK economy and for younger generations. Having digested the shock of the vote, he says things remain \u201cvery tough\u201d.</p> <p>Like Cox\u2019s business, MacLellan has seen some boost to exports from the weak pound. But overseas sales are only around 30% of the company\u2019s \u00a32.8m in annual sales. The larger, domestic part of the business has been dented by uncertainty among clients and the pound\u2019s fall. The company imports raw materials such as plastics and rubber from Malaysia, China and other countries and pays for them in dollars. \u201cIn effect we\u2019ve had a 15% increase in our material costs which we are struggling to pass on to our customers,\u201d says Winfield.</p> <p>The company\u2019s premium products are less sensitive to the pound and are higher margin, so that has cushioned some of the blow from costlier imports.Stronger demand from mainland Europe has also helped. \u201cBut that has not offset that downturn in the UK yet,\u201d adds Winfield.</p> <p>His business in the UK depends on other manufacturers upgrading or expanding their plants and so his order book offers early clues on the sector\u2019s health. Right now, people are putting off decisions, he says. \u201cThey are just waiting to see is the demand still there, do they need to invest elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>He also hopes the UK will retain easy access to export markets. \u201cIf there are 15 pages of documents you have got to get stamped at the local chamber of commerce and we\u2019ve got to be filling in additional paperwork, that will just hamper us immensely.\u201d</p> <p>But overall he tries to strike an optimistic tone. The company, which employs 15 people, is launching new products and looking for ways to replace any lost business, and Winfield feels others are doing the same.</p> <p>\u201cI am a true believer in the British grit to get out there and do a great job and overcome issues, which is what I see happening at the moment.\u201d</p> <h2>BOSSES\u2019 BREXIT VIEWS</h2>",
  "<p>Business groups are braced for a hard Brexit after an uncompromising Conservative party conference that championed taking control of immigration above the need to stay inside the European Union\u2019s single market and secure tariff-free trade.</p> <p>The markets have reacted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/uk-stock-markets-soar-as-sterling-slumps-to-record-low\" title=\"\">sending the pound plunging to levels not seen since the 1980s</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/uk-must-pay-price-for-brexit-says-francois-hollande\" title=\"\">French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande made it clear last week</a> that his reading of the Birmingham conference was the same. \u201cThe UK has decided to do a Brexit, I believe even a hard Brexit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Yet while the momentum is towards a full-blown exit, contradictory noises are coming from chancellor Philip Hammond and business secretary Greg Clark, who favour Britain retaining its place inside the single market.</p> <p>Business leaders are increasingly frustrated at the lack of a coherent plan: is it even possible, they ask, for the UK to extract concessions over access to European markets while also taking back control of immigration?</p> <h2><strong>The game plan, version 1</strong></h2> <p>Banks want to stay inside the single market and retain the EU \u201cpassporting rights\u201d that allow them to send vast sums of money across borders. This attaches the equivalent of an EU passport to all transactions, allowing them to take the fast lane through the banking system without any extra checks.</p> <p>Maintaining these rights would require a special deal for the financial services sector. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/06/hammond-acts-to-reassure-city-and-wall-street-on-brexit\" title=\"\">Last week the chancellor jetted to New York to reassure US bankers</a> that their businesses in London \u2013 and the 25,000 people they employ \u2013 were safe.</p> <p>Other sectors, from pharmaceuticals to agriculture, will also be looking for special deals and this could be problematic. Warwick University professor Nigel Driffield says: \u201cIf they all win concessions, we won\u2019t really be leaving the single market.\u201d</p> <p>International trade secretary Liam Fox, foreign secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit minister David Davis are readying themselves for a long game of poker. Each is convinced they have a strong hand.</p> <p>Davis has recruited civil servants from across Whitehall and handed them large files of documents relating to around 50 sectors. He convened meetings with business leaders soon after the 23 June vote to leave the EU to discuss their concerns about Brexit. But these talks served only to highlight the mammoth nature of the task ahead, as, sector by sector, they forecast the potential impact of leaving the single market \u2013 not just increased tariffs, but extra bureaucracy, too.</p> <p>At this stage, the government hinted at a delay in triggering article 50 \u2013 which will kickstart Brexit talks \u2013 possibly of more than a year, to allow time to formulate a negotiating strategy. Then it became clear that all the information-gathering was going to take too long and there was a change of heart. The prime minister told the Tory conference that article 50 would be triggered by the end of March at the latest. Officials agreed that negotiations would need to be an iterative process, with civil servants learning as they go.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a7df4320c53b6cd35d3f5c41bbecf951c1c4191\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a7df4320c53b6cd35d3f5c41bbecf951c1c4191/0_376_5644_3387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liam Fox wants to walk away from the European single market altogether.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liam Fox wants to walk away from the European single market altogether.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The game plan, version 2</strong></h2> <p>Fox has put together a parallel team to Davis\u2019s that insiders say assumes negotiations with the EU about staying in the single market will end in failure. He favours walking away from the single market and embracing the World Trade Organisation. Currently, Britain\u2019s relationship with the WTO is based on its membership of the EU. Operating solo will mean agreeing new tariffs, in particular for agriculture and most manufactured goods. (The WTO has struggled to agree terms for services.)</p> <p>Fox, who recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/09/fat-and-lazy-britain-is-ill-prepared-to-secure-future-outside-eu-says-fox\" title=\"\">accused British business leaders of being fat and lazy</a>, is expected to favour cutting tariffs to zero, whatever the EU decides. This free-market option, which has the approval of many Brexit-supporting economists, would end tariffs on things like South African beef and Australian wine, boosting disposable incomes in the UK. The tariff on beef from non-EU countries is a hefty 12.8%, plus between \u20ac1,414 and \u20ac3,041 per tonne. The tariff on wine from outside the EU is 30%. How Fox will secure reciprocal deals across the world to protect or boost UK exports is not known.</p> <h2><strong>Single market versus the customs union</strong></h2> <p>Some pro-Brexit campaigners are confident the Brussels elite will wake up to the damage that playing hardball over access to the single market will cause to their own industries.</p> <p>The car industry is often cited as the key to unlocking EU resistance. German carmakers and their workers are hardly likely to support Angela Merkel if the German premier\u2019s bargaining tactics result in Audi and BMW cars costing UK consumers more than they do now.</p> <p>The German view is important, but maybe not as important as the stance taken by Slovakia. This country of 5.4&#xa0;million people is busy building a sleek, modern car industry and doing very well. It is now the largest per capita producer of cars in the world and looking to extend its lead.</p> <p>It sells few cars in the UK, so high tariff barriers would not lead to a significant loss of trade. But Slovakia could only benefit should the extra costs faced by UK exporters encourage the likes of Nissan to shift production from Sunderland.</p> <p>It is easily forgotten that a Brexit agreement must be signed by the remaining 27 EU members states and in most cases ratified by domestic parliaments. This was underlined in Hollande\u2019s speech last week when he said that the EU, to save itself from breaking apart, must block any move towards concessions for the UK without free movement of labour.</p> <p>As an alternative to being in the single market \u2013 or joining Norway in the European Free Trade Area (Efta), which also involves free movement of labour \u2013 the UK could opt for the same status as Turkey and remain a member of the EU customs union. Turkey was rewarded with access to the EU 28, and through that a separate deal with Efta, after it said full membership of the EU was its goal. That may rule Britain out from the start.</p> <p>But membership of the customs union achieves only a one-dimensional relationship, with agreed tariffs that are possibly lower than those for outsider countries. There is still a hefty amount of bureaucracy, and it doesn\u2019t cover the services sector. Given that the UK has a \u00a316bn surplus with the EU in financial services and a \u00a33bn surplus in business services, maintaining these links will be crucial.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4196376d3503a3bf98abd3745a1b35b6bc62a2ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4196376d3503a3bf98abd3745a1b35b6bc62a2ae/0_178_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nissan has asked the UK government to offer compensation for any new tariffs it might have to face.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nissan has asked the UK government to offer compensation for any new tariffs it might have to face.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Compensation payments for tariffs</strong></h2> <p>The EU imposes tariffs on imports from outside the single market. Chinese steel is subject to a 22% tariff while Russian steel costs 36.1% more. Steel from Port Talbot destined for the EU could face a similar surcharge, which would price it out of vital markets. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/nissan-hard-brexit-compensation-new-uk-investment-tariffs\" title=\"\">Nissan has asked for the government to offer compensation for tariffs</a>, whatever they turn out to be.</p> <p>So far ministers have argued that the fall in the pound is compensation enough. But with import prices soaring, the gains for carmakers, which buy 50% of the components in an assembled car from abroad, are limited.</p> <h2><strong>Transitional arrangements</strong></h2> <p>If compensation is ruled out, businesses are keen for ministers to declare that the impact of whatever is agreed will be delayed by a transitional arrangement. This would mean that any deal that, for argument\u2019s sake, leads to a full exit from the single market, is delayed for a transitional period of five of 10 years.</p> <p>Even a deal that offers major British exporters access to the single market will come at a cost, which business leaders say will require a long period of adjustment.</p> <p>And it is the costs in lost business and higher bills for controlling immigration that business leaders want politicians to understand. They complain that the rivalry inside Whitehall means there is no mechanism at the moment to judge the pros and cons of a hard Brexit because the information is sketchy at best.</p> <p>Some businesses complain that they have sat through five or six meetings since July with no idea where the government is going and little feedback. Without some clear guidance by Christmas, investment decisions that have been waiting for a green light since the beginning of the year could be scrapped. The risk is that the much-predicted post-Brexit vote recession is only delayed until 2017.</p>",

After all, his video apology for the \u201cgroping\u201d tape included the following not-very-apologetic words: \u201cBill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days.

  "<p>England\u2019s plans for the Four Nations are beginning to fall into place. Wayne Bennett\u2019s 24-man squad will be revealed in full on Monday but the selection of 10 players in a train-on squad is the first indicator of who he may look towards for the tournament, which begins on 28&#xa0;October.</p> <p>By the time England name their squad, Australia and New Zealand fans will have known for almost a week who will be taking on Bennett\u2019s side and it would not be England without a surprise or two. The biggest one in the initial group of players? The Leeds forward Stevie Ward.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/17/leeds-stevie-ward-huddersfield-super-league-qualifiers-rugby\" title=\"\">Limited to four games all season due to injury</a>, Ward was undoubtedly the standout name in the players picked by Bennett to undergo training and conditioning in Leeds this week. He took his place alongside more established names such as Ryan Hall, as well as three other Rhinos who are, unusually, not involved in the Grand Final in Brett Ferres Tom Briscoe and Kallum Watkins plus Zak Hardaker, who left last year\u2019s Treble winners in June to go on loan to Penrith and whose future at Headingley is up in the air.</p> <p>That Ward has had so little game-time, despite being involved in the 34-man squad meeting with Bennett earlier this year, has provoked some disquiet, but Ward is hopeful it is his lack of action that could earn him the nod when Bennett reveals his final squad.</p> <p>\u201cHopefully, having not played many games is something that works in my favour,\u201d Ward says. \u201cThe thing that is often said about players in this country is that we play too many games, and going into an international series perhaps there might be a danger that some of those lads are tired. However, there\u2019s none of those doubts when it comes to me being involved and I\u2019ll throw myself straight in there if I\u2019m picked, don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d</p> <p>Busy rebuilding his career on the field after a knee injury that kept him on the sidelines for a year, the call into the train-on squad took him by surprise. \u201cIt was a real shock,\u201d he says. \u201cI got an email just after the last game of the season saying I\u2019d be involved. I was taken aback by it, but then thinking back to mid-season and being involved with the meeting, perhaps I should have thought I might getting the call just in case.</p> <p>\u201cI only played four games but they were games I was happy with. I\u2019m delighted to be involved and I\u2019m ready for the call telling me one way or the other whether I\u2019m in.\u201d</p> <p>The 24 players selected will know the post-season holidays will be on ice for at least another month \u2013 maybe longer if England make the final at Anfield on 20 November.</p> <p>Having spent his year-long absence from the sport establishing a successful business, the plans Ward will be cancelling are strictly work-related but he says he will happily rip them up if it means an England debut. \u201cI had some business trips planned for my magazine, <em>Mantality</em>, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m too bothered about having to reschedule in these circumstances,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen the email dropped saying I\u2019d be involved and I\u2019d be training on all these dates, I put the business stuff on ice as quickly as possible.\u201d</p> <p>After concluding training with the rest of the group on Thursday, Ward now faces the anxious wait to discover whether he has made the cut and he is itching to play again as soon as possible after such a long absence. \u201cThe work ethic has been great this week and it\u2019s been good for me to be involved straight away after a lengthy absence,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve overcome some demons and some battles to get back on the field playing.

I just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss, I don\u2019t even wait \u2026 and when you\u2019re a star they let you do it. You can do anything.\u201d<br></p> <p>Bush banters with Trump and eggs him on before the businessman says: \u201cGrab them by the pussy. You can do anything.\u201d<br></p> <p>The comments, made on live microphone, were revealed by the Washington Post on Friday.<br></p> <p>Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate for president, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/784497331647422464\">said via Twitter</a>: \u201cThis is horrific. We cannot allow this man to become president.\u201d<br></p> <p>Trump initially dismissed the vulgar bragging as \u201clocker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago\u201d. He added: \u201cBill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course \u2013 not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended.\u201d</p> <p>But as one Republican after another lined up to condemn the lewd banter \u2013 including the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, who cancelled a joint campaign appearance \u2013 Trump was forced to prepare a fuller apology.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/784609194234306560\">90-second video</a> released after midnight, Trump said: \u201cAnyone who knows me knows these words don\u2019t reflect who I am. I said it. I am wrong. I apologize.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never said I am a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I am not. I\u2019ve said and done things I regret and the words released today on this more than decade-old video are one of them.\u201d</p> <p>However, Trump characteristically tried to turn to his advantage a situation brought about by his own outrageous behaviour \u2013 by pointing the finger at someone else.</p> <p>He continued: \u201cI\u2019ve said some foolish things but there is a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days.

  "<p>One year ago this week, I was sitting in a cramped hotel room with 15 other staffers in Las Vegas for Bernie Sanders\u2019 first debate for the presidential nomination. The question came from CNN: \u201cWhat is the greatest national security threat?\u201d Pundits <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2015/11/sanders-on-climate-link-to-terrorism/\">criticized and mocked</a> him for weeks after he answered \u201cclimate change\u201d. But he was right.</p> <p>And it\u2019s not just Sanders pointing out the imminent threat posed by climate change to global and national security. CIA analysts and our nation\u2019s military strategists are rightfully naming it as a contributor to refugee flows, the spread of disease, and conflicts over basic resources like food and water.</p> <p>In 2014, <a href=\"http://www.ips-dc.org/report-combat-vs-climate/\">17.5 million people were displaced</a> by climate-related disasters. Those numbers will continue to rise dramatically in the coming decades, according to climate displacement program manager Alice Thomas of Refugees International.</p> <p>Our nation\u2019s defense officials know <a href=\"http://www.acq.osd.mil/ie/download/CCARprint_wForeword_c.pdf\">global warming\u2019s destructive forces could undermine fragile governments</a> in unstable regions of the world where extremist ideologies can take root. Yet mainstream Republican avoidance of reality on the science of climate change impedes the necessary reassignment of resources to meet the challenges posed.</p> <p>Now <a href=\"http://www.ips-dc.org/report-combat-vs-climate/\">a new report from the Institute of Policy Studies</a> provides the most accurate calculation of government spending on climate security to date. The picture isn\u2019t pretty. We\u2019re spending 28 times as much on military security than climate security. A public sector investment of $55bn per year is required to meet the challenge, according to the study. With $21bn in the 2017 budget, a shortfall of $34bn is left.</p> <p>That may seem like an insurmountable hill to climb. It\u2019s not! As the IPS report points out, plenty of money lies untouched in the nation\u2019s bloated military budget.</p> <p>The F-35 fighter plane program is a prime candidate for big cuts. It\u2019s the most expensive weapon ever designed, complete with massive cost overruns. The sad cherry on top: the military admits that <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/17/military-admits-billion-dollar-war-toy-f-35-is-f-ked.html\">this plane just doesn\u2019t work</a>. If we turned back now, IPS says we could build enough offshore wind farms to power 320,000 homes for millions of people.</p> <p>Savings from gutting a Navy program designed to build close-to-shore combat ships would provide enough funds to retrain more than 150,000 coal industry workers. The ships have been <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/politics/us-navy-littoral-combat-ship-overhaul/\">plagued with mechanical errors</a>. Our own Government Accountability Office says the \u201cactual lethality and survivability performance of LCS is still largely unproven through realistic testing\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/22/Has-Navy-Wasted-Billions-Its-New-Combat-Ship\">Others have called</a> the ships an outright \u201cwaste\u201d. Retraining and redistributing our fossil-fuel workforce to green jobs would be a welcome reprioritization.</p> <p>Congress could harness additional savings by reducing service contracting and canceling other wasteful or unnecessary weapons programs. But one party largely stands in the way. Republicans are hell-bent on leading our country down an unforgivable road with grave consequences. Their party\u2019s nominee for president <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/09/trump-global-warming-hoax\">believes</a> that global warming is a hoax engineered by the Chinese. That would be comical if it weren\u2019t so dangerous.</p> <p>Rich Americans justify inaction by dismissing climate change as a far off problem that will affect others. But climate change is here and now. And while the sharpest edge of its destructive forces will sadly hurt people of color and lower-income the hardest, we\u2019re all in deep trouble.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://theweek.com/speedreads/653587/hurricane-matthew-kill-weather-channel-warns-unusually-blunt-psa\">unusually forceful public service announcement</a>, The Weather Channel this week warned Floridians that Hurricane Matthew would lead to a heartbreaking loss of life. Florida governor Rick Scott said: \u201cThis storm will kill you.\u201d These un-natural weather occurrences are becoming more and more frequent.</p> <p>My home state of California <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/09/doing-something-about-the-drought_n_7000126.html\">faces its worst drought in 1,200 years</a>. When I traveled home for the holidays two years ago, I saw the devastating impact of climate change firsthand. Where boats once sat docked in my hometown marina, <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2014/12/05/Californias-drought-worst-in-1200-years/7271417805105/\">only dust remained</a>. Climate scientists are telling us that the United States is not immune to the instability and infighting that will occur when populations are forced to fight over food and water. They need only look to California for confirmation, where northerners and southerners <a href=\"http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2015/07/28/is-southern-california-sucking-northern-water-supply-dry-during-drought/\">argue fiercely over water access</a>.</p> <p>The only practical solution to curb unrest, suffering and death here and abroad is a massive redistribution of government money. This week\u2019s new report from IPS serves as a thoughtful blueprint.</p> <p>Republicans should take heed of former GOP President Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s words of wisdom:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.</p> </blockquote> <p>Let\u2019s steward our resources wisely. Let\u2019s choose climate over combat.</p>",

We said it was nicely poised at half-time but I don\u2019t know that many saw that second half coming.</p> <p>Sydney arguably shaded the first half, but the Wanderers were not without their chances.

The Slovak in particular did brilliantly, first for his goal, but then especially for his role in the second. </p> <p>David Carney too was incredibly impressive, but there really wasn\u2019t anyone in a blue shirt who disappointed. It\u2019s a result that sends shudders across the league \u2013 teams will need to watch the tape closely to find cracks in this XI, they were reliable at the back, tenacious in midfield and dangerous up front.</p> <p>For Tony Popovic some very early headaches \u2013 for the second time this season his side have looked decidedly off the pace of key league rivals.</p> <p>Jumpei was a rare bright spot, and Martinez showed his potential in a brief cameo. But this looks a side still struggling to replace that host of quality players they lost in the off-season. Hamill tried hard but the loss of Scott Jamieson was keenly felt, and whereas Nichols and Bulut combined well in patches, you\u2019d imagine the Wanderers will need far more creativity in the front third if they\u2019re to pick apart rival defences.</p> <p>All in all though, a stunning display of attacking football in front of a giant crowd of 61,880.

There\u2019s talk of a record regular season crowd coming through the turnstiles at ANZ Stadium (with Wanderers\u2019 normal home ground at Parramatta currently under renovation). And if that wasn\u2019t enough motivation, Sydney FC captain Alex Brosque lit the touch paper with some, well, frankly over the top comments midweek, in which he stated of the Wanderers players: \u201cWe hate every single one of them\u201d.</p> <p>Both the Wanderers and Sydney FC have had a huge turnover during the off-season. Graham Arnold presumably due to the incredibly disappointing season his chargers had last year. He\u2019d never coached a team that didn\u2019t make the finals; until then. In comes a raft of experienced faces, Socceroos Alex Wilkinson and Michael Zullo, as well as veteran shot-shopper Danny Vukovic to sure up defence. Their problems were up front though with last season\u2019s goal return a whopping goal-a-game less than Melbourne City across the regular season.</p> <p>In comes the delightfully named Bobo, who will be expected to lead the line, as well as re-engage the at times disappointing Filip Holosko.</p> <p>For Tony Popovic it was perhaps a case of being victims of their own success \u2013 key first team players Scott Jamieson, Mark Bridge and Dario Vidosic all saw moves overseas, while Spanish duo Andreu and Alberto as well as livewire winger Romeo Castelen presumably wanted too much more coin to stick around. It\u2019s a host of new faces therefore for the Wanderers, and while players like Jumpei Kusukami and Nicholas Martinez could prove tremendous players it\u2019s made for a disjointed pre-season for Western Sydney; no more evident then during their 4-1 FFA Cup mauling at the hands (or feet) of Melbourne City.</p> <p>Incidentally, no Nikolai Topor-Stanley for this key clash \u2013 he pays a heavy price for his needless dismissal in that game.</p> <p>History suggests Sydney FC have the wood over Wanderers in recent seasons, but you\u2019d imagine with so many new faces that\u2019s essentially moot.

The hurricane smashed through Haiti\u2019s western peninsula on Tuesday with 145 mile-per-hour (233 kph) winds and torrential rain. At least three towns in the hills and coast of Haiti\u2019s fertile western tip reported dozens of people killed, including the farming village of Chantal where the mayor said 86 people died, mostly when trees crushed houses. Food was scarce in Haiti and at least seven people died of cholera, likely because of flood water mixing with sewage. The Mesa Verde, a US Navy amphibious transport dock ship, was heading for Haiti to support relief efforts. </p> <p>Matthew has also triggered mass evacuations along the US coast from Florida through Georgia and into South Carolina and North Carolina. It is forecast to move near or over the South Carolina coast Saturday morning, the National Hurricane Center reports, and it will near North Carolina\u2019s southern coast by Saturday night. </p> <p>The hurricane sideswiped Florida\u2019s coast with winds of up to 120 mph (195 kph) but did not make landfall in the state. There were at least four storm-related deaths in Florida but no immediate reports of significant damage in cities and towns where the storm swamped streets, toppled trees and knocked out power to more than 1 million people. Two people were killed by falling trees, according to Florida officials, and an elderly couple died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator while sheltering from the storm inside a garage. </p> <p>The hurricane raked the Georgia coast, including some of the state\u2019s islands such as St. Simons and Tybee. </p> <p>At 2 a.m. EDT, Matthew had sustained winds of 105 mph (165 kph), and was centered 45 miles (70 kilometers) south of Hilton Head, South Carolina. It was moving north about 12 mph (19 kph).</p> <p>Barack Obama urged people not to be complacent and to heed safety instructions. <br>\u201cThe potential for storm surge, loss of life and severe property damage exists,\u201d the president told reporters after a briefing with emergency management officials.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f8a2e1e4b03258bcac58f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-08T07:44:48.995Z\">8.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The eyewall of the hurricane is currently right on the coast of South Carolina.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HRD_AOML_NOAA/status/784658136863010816\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NOAA43?src=hash\">#NOAA43</a> completed the first leg through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HurricaneMatthew?src=hash\">#HurricaneMatthew</a>.

It is moving north as the nearby coastline bends to the northwest, so the storm is getting farther from the coast. The geometry changes over the next 24h (beginning Friday evening) because the coastline of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina bends back to the northeast. </p> <p>Although the storm may also start bending more to the northeast, that probably won\u2019t happen until the storm center draws nearer to the coastline. The storm may actually make a brief landfall in South Carolina on Friday as a category 1 or 2 hurricane. The storm did not make landfall in Florida which was a great relief because that kept the strongest winds just offshore.</p> <p>Although the most intense winds stayed offshore, bands of moderately strong winds and intense rains are hundreds of miles across and have produced heavy rain and large storm surges along the coast. That will continue into Georgia and the Carolinas tonight and tomorrow. <br></p> <p>So Georgia, South Carolina, and maybe southeastern North Carolina are likely to see some coastal flooding.

In a category 3 hurricane, winds of up to 129mph are expected, homes are likely to be damaged, and trees will be uprooted, blocking roads. Power and water outages are also likely and could last \u201cseveral days to weeks after the storm passes\u201d.</p> <p>Pretty much the only comfort to be had is the fact that Matthew is no longer expected to be a category 4 hurricane \u2013 these are classed as causing \u201ccatastrophic\u201d damage, with roofs ripped off houses and walls blown down in winds of up to 156mph, leaving residential areas cut off by fallen trees and power poles, and the area \u201cuninhabitable for weeks or months\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T09:03:38.057Z\">at 10.03am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f745cee4b05c2f1e952ead\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T07:07:53.799Z\">8.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If you\u2019re in the region, you can share your experiences of what it\u2019s like where you are by filling in the form below, or by clicking on the blue \u2018Contribute\u2019 button at the top of this article.

And as many Floridians heeded calls to evacuate, both candidates began the delicate and difficult task of pursuing votes during a crisis. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign asked the state for more time to register voters a request Florida governor Rick Scott rejected and the Trump team pulled its negative TV ads. </p> <p>\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s a big one and it\u2019s going to be a bad one,\u201d said Trump at a town hall in New Hampshire. \u201cPlease know that we are praying for you and everyone in the path: You\u2019ve got to take care of yourself, you\u2019ve got to get out of the area, you\u2019ve got to listen.\u201d </p> <p>The hurricane is expected to hit Trump\u2019s prized Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, \u201cMr. Trump spoke with employees yesterday to ensure they are safe and following instructions from local officials.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton tweeted: \u201cHurricane Matthew is a major storm. ... Stay safe Florida.\u201d </p> <p>Both stayed far away, preparing for their second debate, a town hall-style faceoff on Sunday in St. Louis. Trump was holding a dry run town hall in Sandown, New Hampshire, while Clinton was speaking at fundraisers in New York. </p> <p>Along the Southeast coast, Matthew was expected to bring dangerous conditions to Georgia, South Carolina and, possibly, North Carolina. But it was the impact on vote-rich Florida, a must-win state for Trump, that had the campaigns on high alert. The hurricane closed in just as both sides ramped up their early-vote push and just days before a voter registration deadline. </p> <p>Vote-by-mail ballots are being sent to voters across the state this week, leaving the potential for ballots to arrive just as voters temporarily abandon their homes. So far, a record 2.5 million people nearly one-third of those who voted in 2012 have made requests for the early ballots. </p> <p><strong>Scott said Thursday evening that he would not consider extending the 11 October voter registration deadline. </strong></p> <p>\u201cEveryone has had a lot of time to register,\u201d Scott said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t intend to make any changes.\u201d </p> <p>Scott, a Republican, is a strong supporter of GOP nominee Donald Trump and chairman of a Super PAC running Clinton-bashing television ads. </p> <p>Disruptions in Florida campaigning were immediate. In Palm Beach County, local Republican Chairman Michael Barnett said Matthew already had forced cancellations, including phone-banking operations and an event where Ivanka Trump was the headliner.

  "<p>Moves to ask parents to submit the country of birth of their children this week as part of the school census have caused a significant backlash on social media, with parents being urged to boycott the survey via the #BoycottSchoolCensus hashtag campaign. Here are the answers to some of the key questions about the census and the campaign against it.</p> <h2><strong>What is the census, and what is new about it this year?</strong></h2> <p>State schools in England supply details about their pupils to the Department for Education for what is known as the school census once every term. The census includes details such as age, address and academic attainments, and these are recorded in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-pupil-database\">national pupil database</a> (NPD). National statistics from the survey are published every year. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/schools-pupils-and-their-characteristics-january-2016\">Here\u2019s the 2016 edition</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/26/parents-boycott-requests-childrens-country-of-birth-information\">Parents urged to boycott requests for children's country of birth information</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year, long before the EU referendum, the DfE decided to add new components for the 2016-17 census, including pupils\u2019 country of birth and nationality. It also started to ask schools to judge children\u2019s proficiency in English if it is not their first language. The DfE has collected data on pupils\u2019 ethnicity for many years.</p> <h2>Can schools ask to see passports or birth certificates?</h2> <p>No. There are reports that many schools have reacted to the new questions on birth and nationality by asking to do so, but the DfE says parents are not obliged to comply.</p> <p>Schools and local authorities <em>are</em> allowed to ask for proof of date of birth during the admissions process, but <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2\">the DfE\u2019s code specifically states</a> they must not ask for \u201clong\u201d birth certificates or \u201cother documents which include information about the child\u2019s parents\u201d.</p> <h2>What is the data used for?</h2> <p>At a basic level the DfE uses the school census for funding and planning. Its intention in adding nationality and language ability was to help gauge the \u201ctargeting of support\u201d for pupils and schools. </p> <p>Academics and journalists conducting research also make extensive use of the database. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/disadvantaged-children-under-represented-in-grammar-schools\">Figures showing that grammar schools have a tiny number of pupils on free school meals</a>, for example, are likely to have come via the NPD. </p> <h2>Who has access to the data?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-pupil-database-apply-for-a-data-extract\">Access to the NPD is restricted</a>, and the restrictions increase with the level of detail. The highest level of access \u2013 known as tier one and which could identify individual pupils \u2013 is only open to a small number of approved applicants, and details identifying individual pupils cannot be divulged.</p> <p>Condition of access includes compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998. This means providing proof of registration with the information commissioner\u2019s office, having appropriate security arrangements in place to process the data, using the data only for the specific purpose requested, keeping it only for the specified length of time and not sharing it without prior written approval.</p> <p><em>Update: the highest level of access to data is tier one, not tier four as previously stated.</em></p> <h2>Why are people worried about the use of the data?</h2> <p>Some people fear the Home Office could use the database to identify foreign-born families, or match the findings to its own immigration database. The timing of the census has heightened this worry.</p> <p>The change was suggested a year ago, but the subsequent vote in favour of leaving the European Union has left the immigration status of EU nationals living in the UK much less clear than it was 12 months ago. With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/liam-fox-refuses-to-guarantee-right-of-eu-citizens-to-remain-in-uk\">Liam Fox suggesting</a> that they could be \u201cone of our main cards in the negotiations\u201d for Brexit, and the home secretary, Amber Rudd, suggesting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/amber-rudd-defends-proposal-to-make-firms-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers\">companies could be forced to reveal how many foreign workers they have</a>, the political atmosphere is highly charged.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/26/parents-boycott-requests-childrens-country-of-birth-information\">Campaigners say the Home Office has a record of accessing other government departments\u2019 data</a>, but the DfE\u2019s official line is that the information will not be shared: \u201cThese data items will not be passed to the Home Office. They are solely for internal DfE use for analysis, statistics and research,\u201d it said.</p> <p>It is worth noting that the Home Office could already do something similar through existing HMRC tax records.</p> <h2>Can you opt out of the data collection?</h2> <p>Yes, to a point. The DfE\u2019s guidance to schools allows parents and carers to refuse to supply the information on nationality and place of birth. It is the first time parents have been given that right in the school census. The school will still supply all the other data it already collects on pupils.</p> <h2>Should you boycott the birth and nationality questions?</h2> <p>It\u2019s very much a matter of personal conscience.</p> <p>It is unlikely the Home Office is trawling the NPD looking for immigrants. It doesn\u2019t currently have the capacity, though it could perhaps in the future. Many school leaders are in favour of the data collection, because it helps them argue for further funding for new places and additional support for those needing to learn English. </p> <p>Boycotting the data collection would send a strong signal to the DfE that they are being too intrusive in their methodology, and that parents are concerned about the potential abuse of the data in the future. One thing is clear though: no schools should be badgering parents to see passports, and parents are entirely right to be refusing these requests.</p>",
  "<p>The first person to spot a clown, the patient zero in the current <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/us/creepy-clown-sightings-in-south-carolina-cause-a-frenzy.html\">epidemic</a> of threatening clowns sightings spreading across the US, was a little boy at a low-income apartment complex in Greenville, South Carolina.<br></p> <p>He ran to his mother, Donna Arnold, and told her what he had seen: two clowns in the woods, both brightly dressed and made up. One with a red fright wig and the other with a black star painted on his face. They whispered something to the boy. </p> <p>\u201cThey were trying to lure him to the house,\u201d his mother told me, pointing toward the woods.</p> <p>A path into the woods led down into a shaded hollow, at the bottom of which was a small pond. Beside it sat a house that seemed abandoned. Someone had boarded up the windows, and the balcony sagged. New bags of potting soil sat near the basement door, though. And a modern security system looked recently installed.</p> <p>After sunset a car approached the house; a gleaming white, new-model Mercedes that looked as out of place as any clown car. The driver stepped out and said she had recently bought the old house as an investment because it sits on five acres in an otherwise densely populated area. \u201cYou think it looks bad now, you should have seen it before I came in,\u201d she said.</p> <p>While we talked she wore an in-ear headset, so it wasn\u2019t always clear whether she was speaking to me or someone on her phone. </p> <p>No, she didn\u2019t want to give her name, she said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Scary clown sightings are getting out of hand\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftheguardian%2Fvideos%2F571461509708283%2F&show_text=0&width=400\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" style=\u201dmax-width:400px;max-height:400px\u201d frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Yes, she had heard about the clown sightings. </p> <p>She gestured toward the apartment complex through the trees. \u201cEvery one of them has a phone, and can work it better than I can,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yet there\u2019s not a single video of a clown?\u201d</p> <p>I followed the path back to deliver the good news to Donna Arnold. The clowns weren\u2019t real. </p> <p>\u201cHa!\u201d she said. One sharp stab of laughter. \u201cCome around to the back.\u201d</p> <p>Her apartment backed up to the same patch of overgrown woods where the clowns had appeared. Arnold pointed to a dented spot in her door where the paint had recently been chipped away. \u201cThe clowns hit it with a chain,\u201d she said, with complete conviction. \u201cI saw them. They hit it and ran off into the woods just as I came out. They\u2019re trying to scare us.\u201d</p> <p>From this patch of woods, the word of prowling clowns began to spread. On the other side of Greenville, first. Then down in South Carolina\u2019s low country. Then North Carolina. Florida. Kentucky. Beyond the south to Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New York. </p> <p>And, finally, my little girl\u2019s school. </p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Nobody laughs at clowns any more.</p> <p>Maybe antiquated proto-clowns did make people smile. But the legendary Chinese jester Yu Sze and the imperial Roman<em> stupidus </em>would be unrecognizable to us today. </p> <p>The first clown who fits our description \u2013 painted face, frilly collar \u2013 was Joseph Grimaldi, who entertained Londoners in the 19th century but had a decidedly dark side. \u201cI am Grim-all-day,\u201d he told people.</p> <p>A young Charles Dickens ghost-wrote Grimaldi\u2019s memoirs, a saga of abuse, addiction and agony. \u201cA tale of unmitigated suffering, even when that suffering be mental, possesses but few attractions for the reader; but when, as in this case, a large portion of it is physical,\u201d Dickens wrote, it \u201cgrows absolutely distasteful\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Clowns hold up a mirror on society \u2026 to be afraid of them is ultimately to be afraid of yourself</p> <footer> <cite>David Kiser, Ringling Bros</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dickens recognized, even with the very first modern clown, that what fascinates us is not the exaggerated painted face, or the dull face of a man underneath. It\u2019s the tension between the two. The dissonance between what is and what appears to be. </p> <p>That conflict plucks at some ancient strand of human genetic code. </p> <p>\u201cSince caveman days, people would smear ashes on their faces to make each other laugh,\u201d said David Kiser, a talent recruiter for Ringling Bros circus company. \u201cOther times they would smear ashes on their faces to scare each other.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>I recently received an automated call from my daughter\u2019s school, in Fairhope, Alabama. It was intended to calm parents, but the missing details spoke more sharply than the ones included.</p> <p>\u201cHi, this is Fairhope middle school calling with an important message,\u201d the cheerful voice began. \u201cPlease rest assured that your students are safe and the school is taking necessary precautions due to rumored activity. The school perimeter is secured and the police are on campus.\u201d</p> <p>The call was meant to prevent worried parents from calling the school.</p> <p>I called. The woman who answered hesitated to describe what had happened.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s \u2026\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the clowns.\u201d</p> <p>Apparently the alarm had started in a neighboring county, where two schools had gone into lockdown after disturbing threats from someone calling himself Flomo Klown. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"11e86cc0ad2b048e27fac7bd5eb7aac033889eb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11e86cc0ad2b048e27fac7bd5eb7aac033889eb4/0_0_639_837/382.jpg\" alt=\"Flomo klown\" width=\"382\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Flomo had a Facebook page.

Some speculated on the best ammunition to bring down a clown. Some advocated restraint \u2013 maybe just paint balls? \u2013 and others reached for .45-caliber pistols.</p> <p>All of it might seem silly but something about the arched eyebrows and garish smile skipped a signal right to the base of people\u2019s brains. </p> <p>They had lost all capacity for critical thought.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>People in Flomaton don\u2019t go in for subtext. Their town sits on the Florida-Alabama state line, so they named it after \u201cFlorida\u201d and \u201cAlabama\u201d and \u201ctown\u201d.</p> <p>Long ago it served as a railroad hub for timber, but its population has since dwindled to 1,400 people who work at Flomaton high school, Wadkins autos or the old train museum. People are polite. Most attend one of several churches. And, it turns out, they don\u2019t tolerate blood-soaked clowns.</p> <p>After Flomo\u2019s scary posts, police locked down the schools and swept classrooms for clown-related evidence.</p> <p>Within minutes the fear spread to other schools, particularly middle schools, where kids were old enough to access social media but still young enough to hyperventilate over clowns.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The picture showed a clown with red, stringy hair and a rubber nose \u2026 His bio read, 'I kill people for a living'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sociologist Robert Bartholomew at Botany College in New Zealand has studied mass hysteria for decades, and said the current clown scare is a result of two rising forces in the US: social media, and a fear of otherness, whether it arrives in a white Mercedes or a refugee boat.</p> <p>\u201cSocial media plays a pivotal role in spreading these rumor-panics which travel around the globe in the blink of an eye,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are part of a greater moral panic about the fear of strangers and terrorists in an increasingly urban, impersonal, and unpredictable world.\u201d</p> <p>That afternoon back in my town, Fairhope, students sprinted through the hallways from one classroom to the next. In class they stared at cellphones and traded stories about how Flomo Klown had killed two boys in Flomaton, and was now moving from school to school.</p> <p>\u201cGood grief,\u201d teacher Kendra Small said. \u201cPlease save me from being trapped in a school with middle schoolers who are <em>sure</em> that clowns are coming to get them.\u201d</p> <p>It started as a satisfying teenage drama, but spiraled into something serious enough to warrant calling the police to make sure the \u201cperimeter is secured\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Later, I showed my 13-year-old daughter a picture of a young woman.</p> <p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d she said.</p> <p>Police say that\u2019s Flomo Klown, I told her. Her real name is Makayla Smith, she\u2019s 22, and police in Flomaton arrested her and two juveniles for allegedly making \u201cterroristic threats\u201d as Flomo.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/23/why-stephen-kings-it-still-terrifies-30-years-on\">Why Stephen King's It still terrifies 30 years on</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My daughter studied the photo with forensic intensity, almost touching it with her nose. \u201cBut she seems like a normal person,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The man who answered the door at Smith\u2019s last known address said he didn\u2019t know her, and Smith is banned from using any internet-capable electronics while she\u2019s on bond. Her friends didn\u2019t respond to requests for help reaching her. But her Facebook page outlines clearly enough a life beginning to spin. </p> <p>In September she posted a picture of a positive pregnancy test, and a block of enigmatic text:<br></p> <p>\u201cWell everyone I have some news to announce, it\u2019s scary yet exciting. It looks like around May 2017 I\u2019ll have a little one of my own. Reason I say it\u2019s scary is because of what happened in 2011 after that I really thought I couldn\u2019t have anymore. I\u2019m so nervous about this but I will be taking things day by day. Please don\u2019t judge or say anything out of the way.\u201d</p> <p>Two days later she allegedly created the Flomo Klown persona and posted, \u201cI love kids.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Reports of scary clowns have come and gone every few years. This time, though, the rumors seem to have reached such a velocity that they have escaped the orbit of imagination and landed in real life.</p> <p>In Kentucky, police recently arrested a 20-year-old man hiding in a ditch, wearing a clown costume. Police in Virginia arrested two teens for wearing clown outfits and chasing children. Meanwhile police in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, arrested a man for falsely claiming he had seen a clown trying to lure children and chased it into the woods. He had made it all up, he told police.</p> <p>It\u2019s a tough moment for clowns. But David Kiser, Ringling Bros\u2019 clown expert, said they will never disappear completely. </p> <p>\u201cThey will have to evolve,\u201d he said. \u201cBut clowns hold up a mirror on society, so we can see the absurd in ourselves. So to be afraid of them is ultimately to be afraid of yourself.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>I used to be a disciplined morning writer, but in the spring of 2010 I was visiting a router-making facility in Shanghai\u2019s Pudong district and witnessed thousands of workers in robin\u2019s egg blue&#xa0;jumpsuits building the equipment necessary to pole-vault China\u2019s technological connectedness ahead of all other countries in our new world order. This tableau prompted in me a gentle realisation that the world was changing even more quickly than I\u2019d thought it was, and that I\u2019d better shake things up creatively to keep pace with it.</p> <p>I asked myself a few questions: how&#xa0;can I imbue fiction with that same fractal sense of falling down a rabbit hole that we all experience when we\u2019re online? How can writing compete with Netflix? How could I compress emotion into as few words as possible \u2013 not just on a page but something people can read from a car at 50 miles per hour?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/07/decca-aitkenhead-douglas-coupland\">Novelist Douglas Coupland: the man who sees into the future</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To this end I deliberately upended what had been a 20-year-old writing routine. No more AM clock-based passivity, quietly awaiting words that may or may not come depending on the fussiness of my muse. No more predictability; instead of sitting there feeling nostalgic for my pre-internet brain, I tried to figure out what my new brain was becoming and how that affected my writing. So if you ask me what is my typical writing day, I have no specific answer, just a series of tendencies which together define my&#xa0;new writing normal.</p> <p>One: I do much of my writing on planes. I\u2019m actually at my happiest when I\u2019m writing on a plane, and I\u2019m writing these words on a plane right now, Lufthansa flight 1436 from Frankfurt to St Petersburg. There\u2019s no Wi-Fi (sanctuary!) and I\u2019m having that not unpleasant sensation of soon-to-end Schengen-era statelessness \u2013 the kind of transnational fluidity so accurately touted by Monocle magazine \u2013 a headspace where all the men wear slim-fit clothing and all the women in little black dresses go back to the office from the Embassy function to do some late night C++ coding.</p> <p><em>Q: Would you like a glass of water with your vodka tonic?</em><br><em>A: No. That\u2019s why God invented ice&#xa0;cubes.</em></p> <p>Two: I do much of my writing in hotel rooms, especially if there\u2019s a deadline. Actually, since I wrote the above paragraph I\u2019ve landed and am now in the St Petersburg W hotel which has killer Wi-Fi and interior design choices possibly made (in the best possible sense) by an oligarch\u2019s mistress. There\u2019s something about being in a hotel room \u2013 most writers know this implicitly \u2013 that frees up one\u2019s thinking. First you place a scorched earth do-not-disturb on your&#xa0;email account (autoreply: \u201cI\u2019m dead and hence unable to reply to your email\u201d) and second, hide the mobile phone in the desk drawer and \u2026 it\u2019s almost as good as being on a plane. Nobody can reach you. You\u2019re safe.</p> <p>Three: I write in places connected in definable ways to the forces of both globalisation and deglobalisation: Shanghai router-making facilities; Chilean classrooms taken over by protesting students, the rooms now converted into artists\u2019 studios; the International House of Pancakes on the&#xa0;north side of Interstate 15 in Las Vegas. The more random and unexpected the better.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e8d61dd887af63f131a6fd0b8fe7d48a3dd27a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e8d61dd887af63f131a6fd0b8fe7d48a3dd27a1/0_209_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Interstate 15, Las Vegas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Interstate 15, Las Vegas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Rose/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a kind of existential heebie-jeebies that accompanies the abandonment of routine: what if I lose my skills and they never come back? What if I become too fragmented? What if the forces of the future I\u2019m trying to depict&#xa0;crush me like a bug? But then, nothing ventured, nothing gained. The&#xa0;world has never been so interesting as it is now. How sad not to&#xa0;go out and bungee-jump into it from&#xa0;a cosmic New Zealand cliff.</p> <p>A few years back, the New York Times did a series of photos of writers in their writing places. All of the other ones I saw were of desks in almost empty white rooms with linen sheers blowing in through the windows. The photo of me was of a small room painted black with all of the walls covered in shelving that was densely filled with hoarder-like amounts of design objects and art. I don\u2019t understand why writers would want an empty white room. It\u2019s like a metaphor for no life after life after death. My spaces will never be normal; normal has never seemed to be my friend.

  "<p>On a cold winter\u2019s morning last November, Michelle James bent over a bulky grey package on her patio. Wrapped in plastic, it lay lengthways on the ground beneath a wooden plant holder. She was with her friend Rhian, and they were about to find out what was inside.</p> <p>A month earlier, James\u2019s friend and upstairs neighbour, Lee Sabine, had died at the age of 74. In the late stages of cancer, Sabine told James about an old medical skeleton she kept in the house: wouldn\u2019t it be funny, Sabine said, if James got it out after she\u2019d gone and put it up in the attic, to scare the people who moved in after her?</p> <p>Armed with kitchen knives, James and Rhian set about cutting through the thick layers of plastic, 41 in all, thinking about the laugh they would have when they sat the skeleton on the couch; the two women wanted to play a joke on their friend, Gareth. But as the final layer gave way, James began to scream. There was an unmistakable stench of decay; this was no student prop, but something much more sinister.</p> <p>James ran inside, telling Rhian to call the police.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The former mining village of Beddau sits in the Rhondda valley, surrounded by lush hills in every shade of green. On a warm late summer evening, children gather in its many playing fields, flying kites and kicking balls between discarded clothes doubling as goalposts; doors are left ajar to let in a breath of air. In its industrial heyday, Beddau was dominated by social housing estates, built to support the colliery and coking plant; more recently, tiers of new estates with smarter cars parked outside have sprung up to accommodate the Cardiff commuters, attracted by low house prices and the proximity to the M4. Newcomers have loosened the stitches of this tight-knit community, where a third of the children attend a Welsh-speaking primary school. Even so, it is a place where generations of families have grown up together, where neighbours still look out for each other and secrets are hard to keep.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"18b866d84a639172048a5d3399db817fbfff7f2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18b866d84a639172048a5d3399db817fbfff7f2d/0_0_771_463/500.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Sabine.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Sabine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Media Wales Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the police arrived at James\u2019s flat in the Trem-y-Cwm block on 24 November 2015, they found human remains on the patio she had shared with Sabine; although partially decomposed, the skull had been well-preserved. A pathologist identified evidence of foul play \u2013 a blow to the back of the head \u2013 and a murder inquiry was launched.</p> <p>That a body had been found in their midst came as a shock to the villagers: there is little serious crime in Beddau. South Wales police had no recent missing persons reports, no assaults, no 999 calls. Initially, they considered the possibility that the corpse had been dumped on the patio by someone who had travelled there from outside the area; but the patio was accessible only via the flats, putting the spotlight on its residents.</p> <p>James was the first to find herself under suspicion. Within hours of calling the police, she was arrested and taken into custody. But as the police looked into James\u2019s account of her neighbour, Lee Sabine, they discovered that a John Sabine \u2013 an accountant and a veteran of the Korean war \u2013 had once been registered at the same address. No one remembered seeing him, and there was no record of his death. The couple had signed a joint tenancy agreement in February 1997; it turned out that John had registered with the local GP that year, and ordered a repeat prescription in April \u2013 but it was never picked up. The body was still clothed in pyjamas with a St Michael label, last used by Marks &amp; Spencer in the year 2000. Detectives identified dental records and a hip replacement serial number, and set about trying to match them with local surgeries or hospitals. They found nothing useful. After 48 hours in custody, James was released.</p> <p>Finally, on 11 December, three weeks after the body was discovered, police got the breakthrough they were looking for. A relative of John Sabine came forward to provide them with a DNA sample: it matched the remains found at Trem-y-Cwm. A postmortem confirmed that Sabine had died as a result of \u201cblunt trauma\u201d to the head. His wife, Lee, was named as the main suspect.</p> <p>The friends who had gathered at Lee\u2019s funeral just a month earlier were stunned. How could the woman they knew, a former nightclub singer and Beddau resident for 18 years, be a murderer? How could her neighbours, who had enjoyed Sabine\u2019s summer barbecues, her tarot card readings and invitations to tea (which often turned into something stronger), not have noticed anything was amiss? With her bleached blond hair and theatrical antipodean accent (she had come to Wales from New Zealand), Sabine could hardly be accused of keeping a low profile. But the more they thought about it, the more they realised the clues had been staring them in the face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"806328eb47a3d11620bcb031f52ff7061ba0b7ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/806328eb47a3d11620bcb031f52ff7061ba0b7ae/0_333_5722_3433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neighbour Michelle James opened the package left lying on their shared patio; she was accused of murder.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neighbour Michelle James opened the package left lying on their shared patio; she was accused of murder.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mary Gardner, a former foster carer who lives in a bungalow with her partner, Ralph, and their teacup Yorkshire terriers Coco and Trixie, still laughs at the memory of the first time she met Lee. \u201cShe was bent over in the street, looking at the ground. I thought she\u2019d lost something, so I went over.\u201d Mimicking Lee\u2019s accent, Gardner continues: \u201cShe said, \u2018Oh I\u2019m all right, darling, I\u2019m just looking for pretty stones.\u2019 I said to her: \u2018You\u2019re not going to find them there.\u2019 She laughed and said: \u2018Take no notice of me, I like to do mysterious things.\u2019<br></p> <p>\u201cShe was a bit of an eccentric. I would always say she was as mad as a box of frogs. But she said it with a smile, and she was always fizzy and bubbly. We hit it off. She made me laugh.\u201d</p> <p>Back then, Gardner lived in a house next to Sabine\u2019s flats; it has since been demolished. Over the years, the pair would often sit together in Sabine\u2019s garden and talk. Sabine, who was 56 when they met, would tell her what she got up to with her male admirers, and Gardner, half scandalised, half intrigued, would never know whether to believe her or not.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was terrified I would go to prison for a crime someone else committed. Lee knew she was dying. Why didn't she confess?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cShe used to wear this wide leather belt and leather gloves,\u201d says Gardner. Standing up, she swishes her arms around in imitation of Sabine\u2019s flamboyant gestures. \u201cShe was always, darling this, darling that. She liked male attention \u2013 any attention. Her bedroom was all silks and satins, with a silk canopy on the ceiling. There were different coloured drapes and cushions over the bed, and the headboard was all gold. I told her her bedroom was like a tart\u2019s boudoir. I\u2019d never seen anything like it. But I liked her: she was a character.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, Gardner had a nagging suspicion that her friend was not all she seemed. She felt Sabine was familiar from somewhere, but couldn\u2019t put her finger on where. And while she liked to talk, Sabine could be mysterious about her own past, retreating from anyone who got too close. Her house was devoid of any photographs, save one black and white shot of her during her days as a nightclub singer in Australia.</p> <p>\u201cI always thought: \u2018Lee, what are you hiding?\u2019 I\u2019d say: \u2018Haven\u2019t you got someone?\u2019 She\u2019d say, \u2018No, I\u2019m better off on my own.\u2019 I asked about kids and she said, \u2018God, no.\u2019 I always thought I had met her previously, but she would say, \u2018No, I\u2019m from New Zealand.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee4accf0b335651c26d39df2748c771d904dbac7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee4accf0b335651c26d39df2748c771d904dbac7/0_182_5716_3430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Gardner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sabine told her friend Mary Gardner she had a grandson who had killed himself, which turned out to be a half-truth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once, after Gardner\u2019s only daughter, Adele, died in 2006, Sabine told her she had a grandson, who she said had killed himself.

We were close.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The truth was, the stories Sabine told about her past depended on her audience. She told some people she had been married a long time ago, and that her husband had been violent and unfaithful; she had left him in New Zealand before emigrating to Wales, where she was rehoused by a women\u2019s charity. But she told others that he had left her.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Lynne Williams, a 54-year-old, gently spoken mother of two from Pontyclun, 10 minutes from Beddau, met a frailer, softer version of Sabine. Sitting in her freshly decorated living room, with a new wooden floor and sparkly silver wallpaper, Williams recalls meeting Sabine at the Royal Glamorgan hospital in Talbot Green; Williams was visiting a relative, and Sabine was then a patient.</p> <p>Over cups of tea made by her daughter, Williams smiles as she recalls the summer of last year. Her heart went out to Sabine, she says, who had been diagnosed with brain cancer after a fall. She had no visitors, and there was nothing on her bedside table to suggest anyone who cared for her. \u201cIt was pitiful, really, she had no one,\u201d she says, her Welsh lilt pausing over the consonants. \u201cShe was suffering, she had ulcers all over her legs. But she was a bubbly person and hid her pain so as not to worry anyone. And that\u2019s what I would do.\u201d</p> <p>Williams, who runs her own cleaning business, took Sabine under her wing, visiting her daily along with the relative she already cared for. She was touched by the older woman\u2019s gratitude. \u201cI would take her out for a fag. It was little things that meant a lot to her. I\u2019m not the most well off, but I\u2019d take her a packet of cigarettes, or I\u2019d make her a hot meal. She would go, \u2018Oh, why did you do that?\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Her bedroom was all silks and satins, with a silk canopy on the ceiling. The headboard was gold</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They became close, which was when Williams started to notice that not everything added up. \u201cThere was always a sticky silence when she talked about the past. But she opened up a bit about her children.\u201d Sabine told her she had five children, three girls and two boys, all of whom she and her then husband had abandoned in New Zealand, when she was 28. If Williams probed further, she changed the subject.</p> <p>\u201cShe said they didn\u2019t want to know her, but her stories were changing all the time. I could see there was a hell of a dark side there.\u201d</p> <p>Pulling her curtains against the low evening sun, Williams takes out her phone to pull up pictures of Sabine in the last months of her life. Dressed in a crushed velvet dressing gown, she is frail, although smiling, and her makeup is immaculate. It always was, William says, even at the end.</p> <p>Several times in those final weeks, Sabine seemed ready to open up, she adds. \u201cShe once said: \u2018I\u2019ve got a secret\u2019 but then changed the subject.\u201d Later, she asked Williams for her address, saying she wanted to write her a letter. But after she died, no letter was found.</p> <p>One night, after Sabine had been allowed home from hospital, Williams and Michelle James were sitting at her kitchen table, when she asked her friends for help. \u201cHer words were, \u2018I need you to do me a favour,\u2019\u201d Williams says. \u201c\u2018There\u2019s a skeleton in the shed and I need you to move it to the attic to scare the people who move in.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI turned around and said: \u2018I hope it\u2019s not a bloody real one.\u2019 She pointed her finger at me with those big orange nails \u2013 she always painted her nails orange \u2013 and said, \u2018You never know.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bff978619965da024cc786acce05259d47077da9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bff978619965da024cc786acce05259d47077da9/0_0_2448_3264/750.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Sabine in the 70s.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Sabine in the 70s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By that point, Sabine knew she was dying. To this day, Williams isn\u2019t sure whether she meant them to open the package before or after her death.Had she not been so busy with her cleaning business, she would have moved the package up to the attic, she says. It could have been her, not James, who found John Sabine.</p> <p>After Lee died, Williams cleared out her cluttered two-bedroomed flat, along with other friends and neighbours. She was disturbed by what she describes as a number of \u201cnasty\u201d letters she found, written by Sabine to people in Beddau. They were unkind, full of bile, and seemed at odds with the community-loving woman she knew.</p> <p>Then came James\u2019s macabre discovery on 24 November. \u201cFor a long time I couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she say something? She knew she was going to die \u2013 why didn\u2019t she tell us? Sometimes I would say that I was used. Other times, I remember the way she thanked me every night before she went to sleep. I am a good dealer with things. I can\u2019t be bitter.\u201d</p> <p>It was a mystery to her, and to the police: how had Sabine managed to conceal her husband\u2019s body for so long? Apart from the attic, there was simply no room: a double divan took up most of the space in one bedroom, and there was a single bed in the other. \u201cOne of the drawers was half the length of the divan,\u201d Williams remembers. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t put a body in it.\u201d</p> <p>She is convinced that the fall Sabine suffered just before her cancer diagnosis came as she was moving the heavy body down from the attic. (As for how a frail 74-year-old woman managed to do this alone, nobody can say, but the police are not looking for an accomplice.) Williams wondered why, as soon as Sabine got home from hospital, she was so keen to get her carpets professionally cleaned. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even look dirty,\u201d she remembers. \u201cThe machine broke down and she demanded they come the following day to finish it.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>By mistake or design, in her dying days Sabine let her guard down, although she never went as far as a confession. As the police investigated, they found she had gone further in the past, and on more than one occasion. In early 2000, while carrying out a tarot card reading, she blurted out a confession to Bernadette Adamiec, a Beddau hairdresser. Adamiec, who did not take her seriously, told police that Sabine had told her she was going to be \u201cfamous... because of the body in the bag\u201d. The police still consider this evidence vital, but Adamiec tells me she thinks that as a confession it has become overblown; she no longer wants to talk to journalists.</p> <p>Sabine was hiding in plain sight: a relative newcomer in a Welsh village where she could construct whatever version of herself she wanted. As for her husband, no one missed him, because no one had ever met him. But, as the murder investigation progressed, it turned out that little in Sabine\u2019s carefully constructed story, or series of stories, was true.</p> <p>Detective chief inspector Gareth Morgan of South Wales police led the inquiry. His team traced the Sabines back to the 50s, when they first met in London, where Lee was training as a nurse. The couple had four children together in Britain, before emigrating to New Zealand where they had a fifth. Then, in 1969, they abandoned their children in an Auckland nursery: two boys, Steve and Martin, and three girls, Susan, Jane and Lee-Ann, aged between two and 11 years old.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ff37c319ac9a903c0539c4c80bf4c6a6e901524\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ff37c319ac9a903c0539c4c80bf4c6a6e901524/0_0_808_1045/773.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Sabine in the gardens of the Royal Glamorgan hospital before she died last year.\" width=\"773\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Sabine in the gardens of the Royal Glamorgan hospital before she died last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat was an incredible story in itself,\u201d Morgan says. \u201cWe made contact with the children, and the whole story started unravelling.\u201d The couple had fled to Perth in Western Australia, where they went by the names Lee and John Martin, and where Lee tried to build a career as a singer. In 1984, they returned to New Zealand and made contact with their children in an apparent change of heart. But after their daughters brought a TV reporter to the house, the couple quickly disappeared again. During the investigation, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-35104524\">heartbreaking film footage emerged</a> from New Zealand, of Jane and Lee-Ann, then teenagers, confronting the parents who had abandoned them.</p> <p>As more details emerged, Sabine\u2019s neighbours were forced to adjust their memories of her. Gardner learned that the \u201cgrandson\u201d Sabine had referred to was in fact her son, Martin, who killed himself in 2000. She was not from New Zealand, as she had claimed, but the daughter of a Welsh miner and a mother who abandoned her when she was a toddler. She was born 11 miles from Beddau, in the village of Gelli. \u201cYou know, like her, I was in and out of care,\u201d Gardner says. \u201cSo it\u2019s possible we had met before. She was a Rhondda girl. We saw a Lee and it wasn\u2019t a Lee.\u201d Her real name was Ann.</p> <p>***</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until a BBC news report screened footage of that family confrontation in New Zealand that Morgan found the final piece of the jigsaw: the murder weapon. A friend who had known the couple when they lived in Reading in the 90s came forward and told the detective about a call she received from Sabine, \u201cout of the blue\u201d, in 1997. Valerie Chalkley asked her friend, who had just moved to Beddau, whether she was still with John, joking that she thought they might have killed each other by now. Sabine said: \u201cI have killed him. I hit him over the head with a stone frog.\u201d</p> <p>Chalkley laughed it off as a typical exaggeration, but was rattled enough to call her back a couple of days later to ask how John was.</p> <p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s all right, just the same,\u201d came the reply. It was as if the previous conversation hadn\u2019t happened, but it stayed with Chalkley.</p> <p>Morgan remembered Michelle James telling him that Lee had told her to take what she wanted from the flat after she died. He asked her: \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have a stone frog?\u201d She had, stored in a shoebox alongside other items she had yet to sort through; Sabine had kept the frog by the side of her bed. When pathologists matched it against the cluster of injuries and skull fractures on John Sabine\u2019s head, they found the distinctive shape of its leg and eye fitted exactly.</p> <p>On the wall of Morgan\u2019s office at Bridgend police station is a picture of his prime suspect, taken from an interview about her garden in a local magazine \u2013 his trophy of a two decade old murder that has now been solved. \u201cI do really love living in Beddau and feel part of the community,\u201d Sabine says in the article. \u201cIt\u2019s a special place.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4f32d294e7d9aed46c0b010386e15fd32057289b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f32d294e7d9aed46c0b010386e15fd32057289b/0_0_808_457/500.jpg\" alt=\"Lee and John Sabine abandoned children Jane, Steve, Susan, Martin and Lee-Ann in 1984.\" width=\"500\" height=\"283\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee and John Sabine abandoned children Jane, Steve, Susan, Martin and Lee-Ann in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Media Wales</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morgan believes Lee may have killed her husband during one of their heated arguments, and that she kept her husband hidden in the flat for 18 years; but he has found no evidence of the attack site, and no clue as to where the body was stored. \u201cWe did meticulous forensic work,\u201d he says, \u201cbut nothing. It was an immaculate house. She had steam cleaners in over the years.\u201d</p> <p>Morgan believes she wrapped the body intermittently over the years, using Tesco bags, plastic sheeting and bungee cords. \u201cWhen it started to smell, she would add another layer.\u201d (Ironically, it was this process, wrapping the body so tightly it was effectively mummified, that preserved the evidence; had she not been so careful, James might have uncovered something that looked like a medical skeleton \u2013 as Sabine must have expected.)</p> <p>With every year that passed, Sabine had grown bolder. She removed John\u2019s name from the tenancy in 1998, enabling her to have a single occupancy council tax discount and improve her benefits. She continued to receive his army pension. In August 2005, when he would have been 75 and eligible for a free TV licence, she transferred it to his name.</p> <p>If she ever felt remorse for her crime, Sabine never expressed it. But in her final months, there were signs that, even as a staunch atheist, she had begun to dwell on whether she might be judged after her death.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Mary West, a street pastor who became the executor of Sabine\u2019s will, recalls an intelligent woman, an avid Radio 4 fan who loved to argue and discuss issues, including God. Sabine would look in on West\u2019s sick mother, who lived in a downstairs flat at Trem-y-Cwm.</p> <p>\u201cI remember her coming down one day and saying, \u2018There\u2019s so much love here,\u2019\u201d West says. \u201cI think she began to reflect on what she\u2019d given up.\u201d</p> <p>If she did, it did not extend to contact with the children she had left behind. When it became clear Sabine did not have long to live, West got in touch with her neighbour\u2019s children on Facebook. Her youngest daughter, Lee-Ann, called West.</p> <p>\u201cThe first thing she asked me was, \u2018How\u2019s my father?\u2019 I said I didn\u2019t know. I asked Lee and she said: \u2018Darling, he left me.\u2019 Lee-Ann was in straitened circumstances herself, but said she was prepared to come over and see her.\u201d</p> <p>West recalls Sabine\u2019s reaction: \u201cLee was horrified. She was losing her voice then and she said: \u2018I don\u2019t want them to see me in this state.\u2019\u201d Then, presumably referring to the reunion that had gone so badly wrong in 1984, she worried that her daughter would bring the press with her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In 1969, the couple abandoned their five children in an Auckland nursery; she said she had a singing contract</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>West still struggles with Sabine\u2019s abandonment of her children when they were so young. \u201cI can\u2019t get my head round that. I asked her about it and she said: \u2018Well, I had a singing contract in Australia. I left them in the care of social services.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cTowards the end, she said to me: \u2018You know, don\u2019t you?\u2019 I said, \u2018I know you have cancer.\u2019 She said to me: \u2018You are close to God. He sent you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>With hindsight, West believes this was the closest Sabine got to expressing some kind of remorse.</p> <p>In the eulogy she gave at Sabine\u2019s funeral, at Glyntaff crematorium on 10 November 2015, West told the 40-strong congregation, all of whom seemed to know a different side of her: \u201cThe only person who knows the true story of Lee\u2019s life was Lee.\u201d She paid tribute to the caring side that many in Beddau had seen. She told the gathering of friends and neighbours: \u201cWe do not know the difficulties she had in her life \u2013 only she and God know that. But we do know that she was an immensely loving person.\u201d</p> <p>While West and, to a lesser extent, Williams have come to terms with the lies and half-truths Sabine told them, others have found her betrayal harder to deal with. As West explains, \u201cThe sad thing is, it touched a community, a caring community. There is a level of hurt still there.\u201d</p> <p>James, 45, remains haunted by her ordeal. A mother of three and grandmother of five, she suffered the trauma not only of finding the body, but then being arrested and put in custody. She was taunted by locals who called her a murderer, and subsequently rehoused by the council; she now feels isolated and misses her old friends in the village. Already fragile, she has recently been diagnosed with PTSD as a consequence of what happened that November morning last year.</p> <p>\u201cShe has messed me up,\u201d she says of Sabine. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep properly. When I close my eyes, it\u2019s all there. That poor man, left out there. I can\u2019t look after my grandchildren. I can\u2019t watch the programmes I used to watch. When I was at the police station, I thought I would never see my kids or grandkids ever again. I was terrified I was going to prison for a crime someone else committed. They were saying to me \u2018Who is it?\u2019 and I said, \u2018I promise, I don\u2019t know.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI used to go around almost every day and help her,\u201d she continues, wiping away tears. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she confess? She knew she was dying. She knew what she was doing to me. She is still doing it to me. Why?\u201d</p> <p>On the other side of the world, Sabine\u2019s children have struggled to come to terms with the revelations of the past year, too. A year before their mother died, her daughter Jane \u2013 prompted by her own daughter, Nicole \u2013 decided to write Sabine a letter. The response was a card bearing an image of a phoenix rising from the ashes. Inside was a note, handwritten and in capitals: \u201cLike the phoenix, I will arise from the ashes and sleep will obey me and visit thee never. For my eyes are upon thee, forever and ever. I have served my life sentence of shame and blame. Now it is your turn to do the same.\u201d She signed it: \u201cYour nemesis, Ann Lee Sabine.\u201d It was the last contact they had.</p> <p>Since their mother\u2019s death, amid the resurfacing of painful memories, the children have discovered something else: family members they did not know existed. They had no idea they had two half-siblings (their father\u2019s two children from a previous relationship), and that their mother had a cousin who still lives in Wales. Jane, now 50, says these new connections have given them a glimmer of hope. Next year, she says, talking to me on Facebook, she plans to travel to the UK with her sister, to meet the family she never thought she\u2019d see.</p>",

So the 27 are not going to allow the British to combine single-market membership with controls on EU migration.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In 40 years, the relationship between the United States and Vietnam has swung about as widely as is possible between two countries. In 1975, the US cut diplomatic ties with Hanoi after<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/apr/21/40-years-on-from-fall-of-saigon-witnessing-end-of-vietnam-war\" title=\"\"> the end of the Vietnam war </a>(AKA&#xa0;the second Indochina war),&#xa0;which left more than a million Vietnamese and more than 58,000 Americans dead. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/02/usa.jonathanwatts\" title=\"\">US officials and allied South Vietnamese famously fled Saigon</a> (now Ho Chi Minh City) in the biggest helicopter airlift in American history. Now, though the country remains a highly repressive, nominally communist state, it has become one of Washington\u2019s dearest friends in Asia.</p> <p>The US navy pays regular port calls in Vietnam. President Obama lifted the ban on sales of lethal arms to Hanoi, which had been in place since the end of the war. The two nations have roughly $45bn (\u00a335bn) in annual bilateral trade. When the head of Vietnam\u2019s Communist party visited Washington last year, he made the rounds of official meetings, think-tank talks and private briefings like a conquering hero.</p> <p>Such a swing in relations might seem unusual. Since the Vietnam war introduced Americans to the country, journalists, historians and many foreign leaders have viewed it through a narrow prism: Vietnam is a country repeatedly invaded by foreign powers, from imperial China to colonial France to the US; it is a country with a tenacious people, whose identity has been forged by fighting invaders. Vietnam\u2019s foremost heroes, such as the 18th-century emperor Quang Trung, and Ho Chi Minh, are those whose wars forced foreign powers out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/apr/22/vietnam-40-years-on-how-communist-victory-gave-way-to-capitalist-corruption\">Vietnam 40 years on: how a communist victory gave way to capitalist corruption</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as Christopher Goscha shows in his groundbreaking book, Vietnam has always been a far more complicated place \u2013 politically, strategically, economically and culturally - than this image of a country of stubborn, united fighters. He manages the (not easy) task of showing Vietnam\u2019s complexity without losing the reader with too much detail. Goscha understands that Vietnam is a land long coveted by major powers \u2013 it&#xa0;is a narrow spit of coast with fertile deltas, astride one of the most important trade routes in the world. But it has also been a major regional power itself. At times, it has fought back against foreign powers, but at other times it has sought diplomatic alliances, or welcomed migrants into what is a very ethnically and religiously diverse country.</p> <p>Vietnam has enjoyed periods of unity, but even the Vietnamese Communist party was more divided than most outsiders realised. And today, Vietnam\u2019s unity has serious fractures.</p> <p>Goscha has provided quite simply the finest, most readable single-volume history of Vietnam in English. He takes on some persistent myths about the country. First, that Vietnam has been constantly preyed on. In the pre-colonial period, southeast Asia\u2019s own empires constantly colonised each other. A series of Vietnamese empires conquered parts of modern-day Laos and Cambodia between the 15th and 19th centuries, while alternately fighting and placating China\u2019s rulers, who saw Vietnam as a vassal state.</p> <p>Second, Goscha shows that Vietnamese dynasties were actively modernising the country before French colonisation began in the mid to late 19th century. The Nguyen dynasty was establishing new tax and irrigation systems, new schools and a modern bureaucracy when France declared its rule over Indochina.</p> <p>Under the Nguyens, the French and the two governments of South and North Vietnam, the country was hardly monoethnic, though the pictures most&#xa0;Americans saw of Vietnam were of ethnically Viet people. Vietnam, as&#xa0;Goscha argues, has long been influenced not only by the majority ethnic Viet and by Chinese Confucian culture, which spread south over centuries, but also by a far broader range of cultures and peoples.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"054ac9d0274ae5be384b9205e01d2c6dd708d507\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/054ac9d0274ae5be384b9205e01d2c6dd708d507/0_297_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A napalm strike near US troops on patrol in South Vietnam, 1966.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A napalm strike near US troops on patrol in South Vietnam, 1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the French and American eras, Paris and Washington made much of the need to protect oppressed religious minorities \u2013 primarily, Catholic Vietnamese \u2013 as a reason for military involvement in Indochina. (This was not the primary driver of US policy, which was based on strategic calculations, but it was an effective rhetorical device.) The flight of up to one million North Vietnamese, many of them Catholics, to the south after the country was divided in 1954, fleeing in boats provided in part by the US navy, captured the imagination of Americans and Europeans. The evacuation made US folk heroes of such people as Tom Dooley, a handsome, Kennedyesque American Catholic priest who helped with the refugee exodus and then wrote a bestseller about it.</p> <p>Some western liberals, in turn, saw Catholics and other religious minorities as somehow unrepresentative of Vietnam \u2013 an idea punctured by the fact that Ngo Dinh Diem, the brutal South Vietnamese leader, was a Catholic. But Goscha adds complexity here as well. He shows that Catholics, reformist Buddhists and many powerful local religions enjoyed vast public support, and were just as often modernising forces as retrograde ones. And French and American policies were not always simply pro-Catholic. During the colonial era, France was a republican and often harshly anti-clerical state, and Paris inherently distrusted French Catholic priests in Vietnam, who taught in local languages&#xa0;and often subtly undermined colonial rule.</p> <p>Goscha also adds to the growing pile of evidence showing that virtually all of the policy mistakes made by the US during the Vietnam war had been made, in almost all the same ways, by France in its Indochina war between 1946 and 1954. Of course, the US military dramatically stepped up the asymmetrical warfare when joined in the Vietnam war, as Goscha notes. Its<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/31/laos-deadly-aftermath-us-bomb-campaign-vietnam-air-attacks\" title=\"\"> bombing campaigns</a> were of a very different scale. Yet US policy-makers insisted then \u2013 and some still insist \u2013 that they acted differently, that America was not a colonial power in Vietnam and the US could succeed, they thought, by working with local nationalist leaders. It had done so in&#xa0;the Philippines, backing second-world-war hero Ramon Magsaysay and&#xa0;helping him defeat a communist insurgency in the 1950s. But Magsaysay had strong popular support, and&#xa0;the situation in the Philippines was not replicable in Vietnam.</p> <p>Between 1975, when the country was reunified at the end of the war, and the early 90s, Vietnam\u2019s already battered society struggled through more upheavals, ones little understood outside the country. The Vietnamese military invaded Cambodia and removed its former ally the Khmer Rouge in 1979. Hanoi fought a border war with China in the same year.

  "<p>The two adaptations may not seem closely related. This week the film version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/paula-hawkins\">Paula Hawkins</a>\u2019s bestseller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/08/the-girl-on-the-train-paula-hawkins-review-novel\"><em>The Girl on the Train</em></a>, starring British actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/emily-blunt\">Emily Blunt</a> but transposed from south-east England to the New York commuter belt, was released in the UK. Meanwhile, later this month, a new dramatisation of Wilkie Collins\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jul/22/book-beach-the-moonstone-wilkie-collins\"><em>The Moonstone</em></a>, initially published as a weekly serial in 1868, will be screened by the BBC. <em>The Girl on the Train</em> is being trumpeted with all the noise that a major Hollywood studio can make; <em>The Moonstone</em> will be shown on five consecutive days. Yet the books from which they derive are closely connected. Hawkins\u2019s novel is one recent, hugely successful incarnation of a type of fiction that Collins invented. We call it the \u201cpsychological thriller\u201d.</p> <p>Collins is simply one of the most influential of all English novelists. In the 1860s he published his four great \u201csensation novels\u201d (as they were dubbed by contemporary reviewers): <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/nov/26/woman-in-white-150-years-sensation\"><em>The Woman in White</em></a>, <em>No Name</em>, <em>Armadale</em> and <em>The Moonstone</em>. Wildly popular for a time, his books were largely scorned as melodramatic crowd-pleasers after his death in 1889, but began to be reassessed in the late 20th century (now almost all of them are in print as \u201cclassic\u201d editions). Look closely at his most powerful books and it is extraordinary how many of the features of the modern psychological thriller he foresaw.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/29/emily-blunt-the-girl-on-the-train-video-interview\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/553hc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2758278\"            data-video-name=\"Emily Blunt on The Girl on the Train: 'The vomit was not my own' \u2013\u00a0video interview\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ebf399e4b01b56deffc51c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/29/160929GirlonTrainJunketV2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/29/160929GirlonTrainJunketV2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/29/160929GirlonTrainJunketV2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/29/emily-blunt-the-girl-on-the-train-video-interview\">Emily Blunt on The Girl on the Train: \u2018The vomit was not my own\u2019 \u2013 video interview</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><em>The Moonstone</em> is the story of a crime within a family. In the first instance, a famous diamond is stolen during a weekend house party at a country home. In trying to discover what has happened to the jewel, the novel\u2019s characters, including the falsely accused hero Franklin Blake, begin stumbling on the dark secrets at the heart of their respectable social circle. What began as the story of a theft eventually takes in obsessive sexual passion, suicide, embezzlement and murder. Sergeant Cuff, the great detective who is dispatched from London, fails to find the thief but is the catalyst for the uncovering of these secrets. Collins elaborates his plot entirely through the accounts of witnesses and participants. The reader must piece it all together.</p> <p>Calling a thriller \u201cpsychological\u201d credits it with a kind of literary complexity. The very first recorded use of the term \u201cpsychological thriller\u201d was in an admiring review of Somerset Maugham\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/painted-veil.html\"><em>The Painted Veil</em></a> in 1925. Most dictionaries of literary terms lack an entry for this genre, as if it were a figment of reviewers\u2019 or publishers\u2019 imaginations. A cynical interpretation would be that it is a thriller that an intelligent person is happy to be seen reading. Hawkins\u2019s novel gained a place on Barack Obama\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/aug/19/all-the-presidents-reading-lists\">summer reading list</a>, thereby endorsed as the thinking person\u2019s page-turner. A couple of years ago it was Gillian Flynn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gone-girl\"><em>Gone Girl</em></a>, also made into a glossy and violent film, that successfully filled this niche.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In this genre, the killer is not a dedicated monster, but someone close to us, someone familiar</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is where genre fiction and literary fiction overlap. One of the books on this year\u2019s Man Booker shortlist, Ottessa Moshfegh\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/20/eileen-by-ottessa-moshfegh-review-bell-jar\"><em>Eileen</em></a>, is declared to be a \u201ctaut psychological thriller\u201d in a quotation from an admiring reviewer blazoned on its cover. Certainly it displays some of the key features of the psychological thriller. It has a first-person narrator on whom we rely, yet whose view of the world sometimes seems warped. <em>Eileen</em> works as an administrator in a prison for young offenders, whom she likes to study. \u201cThe best was when I could see the hard face of a cold-hearted killer breaking through the chubby cheeks and callow softness of youth. That thrilled me.\u201d Like those of a character in a novel by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ruth-rendell\">Ruth Rendell</a> (the British doyenne of the psychological thriller), her thought processes are at once logical and twisted. <em>Eileen</em> has a narrative that, we know with delicious apprehension, is heading towards a nasty, probably violent, conclusion. There is already talk of a film adaptation of Moshfegh\u2019s novel. This is hardly surprising: \u201cpsychological thriller\u201d has long been a description applied equally to novels, on the one hand, and film or TV dramas, on the other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b191b4ebe69633554690ed9960ec37750c5e5929\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b191b4ebe69633554690ed9960ec37750c5e5929/0_322_2760_3449/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Hadland and John Thomson in the BBC\u2019s The Moonstone\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Hadland and John Thomson in the BBC\u2019s The Moonstone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ray Burmiston/BBC/King Bert/Ray Burmiston</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In one way these stories are the opposite of the serial killer fantasies with which we have been diverting ourselves for several decades. In the psychological thriller the killer is not a dedicated monster, it is someone close to us, someone familiar. The genre thrives in domestic settings. Tell Amazon that you like \u201cpsychological thrillers\u201d and you will be offered novels with titles such as <em>The Woman Next Door</em> by Cass Green, <em>Follow You Home</em> by Mark Edwards or <em>Behind Closed Doors</em> by BA Paris. It is no accident that the settings of both <em>Gone Girl</em> and <em>The Girl on the Train</em> are banal. <em>Gone Girl</em> is mostly located in a numbingly ordinary Missouri town where Nick and Amy move after their careers in New York falter. <em>The Girl on the Train</em> takes place in a fictional commuter town on the rail line from Euston.</p> <p>Each novel concerns itself with the mysteries within marriages. Indeed, both rely on the unsettling, fascinating idea that a man or a woman might not really know the person to whom he or she is married. They are tales of shocking marital discoveries, seen from within. The trick of Flynn\u2019s novel is to set the husband\u2019s and the wife\u2019s narratives alongside each other. For a long while it looks as though Nick has the secrets and knows better than Amy \u2013 but slowly you begin to understand that the reverse is the case. And indeed, that Nick has little idea of the full force of his wife\u2019s insight and willpower.</p> <p>This discovery of what might thrill us in domestic circumstances should also be credited to Collins. It was Henry James who famously saw his originality in these terms. \u201cTo Mr Collins belongs the credit of having introduced into fiction those most mysterious of mysteries, the mysteries which are at our own doors.\u201d The bourgeois household is his stage: no wonder his mysteries turn so often on the testimonies of servants. Terrible things happen in familiar places. In <em>The Woman in White</em> the most frightening location is a comfortable family home in Hampshire, within a few minutes\u2019 walk of a railway station.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcb22334443769a37b4f2c24c130816341980cd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcb22334443769a37b4f2c24c130816341980cd1/0_224_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Affleck and Rosamunde Pike in the film version of Gone Girl.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Affleck and Rosamunde Pike in the film version of Gone Girl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/New Regency Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his great novels of the 1860s, Collins invented a series of narrative tricks and peculiar plot elements that thriller writers still draw on. <em>The Girl on the Train</em> depends on the fact that one of its narrators, Rachel, suffers from alcohol-induced memory loss. She struggles through the book to recover the memories that might explain a woman\u2019s mysterious disappearance. She even wonders whether she might somehow be responsible. It was Collins who introduced to the English novel this strangest of possibilities: that a person might not know what they know \u2013 might not even know what they have done. In <em>The Moonstone</em> opium removes some characters from conscious control over their actions. In <em>Armadale</em> Lydia Gwilt, the beguiling villainess, swears by it. \u201cWho was the man who invented laudanum? I thank him from the bottom of my heart.\u201d (Laudanum was opium steeped in alcohol.) Collins\u2019s close friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/charlesdickens\">Charles Dickens</a> was so intrigued by the fictional possibilities of opium addiction that he put it at the heart of his own, unfinished psychological thriller, <em>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</em>, in which the frighteningly obsessive choirmaster John Jasper is wedded to the drug.</p> <p>One returns to Collins\u2019s novels with the thrill of recognition. Even some of his unaccountable quirks have become conventions of thriller writing, though modern practitioners will have been unaware that they were following a pattern set by this unconventional Victorian. So, for instance, Collins liked to use physical disabilities in his mystery stories. The heroine of <em tabindex=\"-1\">Hide and Seek</em> (1854) is deaf. It was followed by <em tabindex=\"-1\">The Dead Secret</em> (1857), in which the heroine, Rosamond Treverton, marries a blind man. His later novel <em tabindex=\"-1\">Poor Miss Finch</em> (1872) features a blind heroine. This exploration of radically restricted perceptions seems to be another version of his interest in altered states of consciousness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fda810dec59148fcf9cb768e3f9143ccdaeb37f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fda810dec59148fcf9cb768e3f9143ccdaeb37f5/201_178_2477_3096/800.jpg\" alt=\"Wilkie Collins (1870).\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilkie Collins (1870).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of this interest was rooted in experience. Collins himself had become an opium addict as a result of taking large doses of laudanum to relieve his rheumatism. He knew all about the narcotically induced trances of which he wrote. Indeed, it is hard to imagine that his stories could carry such conviction if he had not himself led such an unconventional life. The son of a painter, he came from a bohemian background and remained a sworn enemy to bourgeois conformity. He liked to dress idiosyncratically and he flaunted his Francophilia. He loved French cooking and approved of liberal French attitudes to sexual mores. He never married but had long-term relationships with two women. The first was Caroline Graves, a widow with whom he lived for almost three decades and whose daughter he adopted. The second was Martha Rudd, a servant he met on a holiday in Norfolk, by whom he had three children and whom he maintained in comfort in a separate London household. All were acknowledged and provided for in his will.</p> <p>Though Collins was the pioneer, there were, of course, other sensation novelists. Writers like Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Charles Reade and Mrs Henry Wood thrilled the Victorian reading public with their tales of bigamy, fraud and sexual passion. Yet Collins was singular not just because he was the first, or because his plots remain the most intriguing, but because he was formally adventurous. Above all, he pioneered the use of multiple narrators. His preface to <em>The Woman in White</em> declared, \u201cAn experiment is attempted in this novel, which has not (so far as I know) been hitherto tried in fiction. The story of the book is told throughout by the characters of the book.\u201d Collins made it possible that a narrator might even be a culprit. He showed how to extract thrills from narrative unease. In <em>The Moonstone</em> the characters are like witnesses in a courtroom. They include the garrulous steward, Gabriel Betteredge, the heroine Rachel Verinder\u2019s absurdly moralistic cousin, Miss Clack, and the opium addict Ezra Jennings. Often they have misunderstood what they have seen. No Godlike narrator presides.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/oct/03/gone-girl-you-night-draft-day-life-after-beth-video-reviews\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/42599\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2169027\"            data-video-name=\"Gone Girl, You and the Night, Draft Day and Life After Beth: the Guardian film show \u2013 video reviews\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/2/1412269710341/Ben-Affleck-in-Gone-Girl-021.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-448756809\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/2/1412269710341/Ben-Affleck-in-Gone-Girl-021.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/10/02/141002TGFSGoneGirl2-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/10/02/141002TGFSGoneGirl2_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/10/02/141002TGFSGoneGirl2/141002TGFSGoneGirl2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/10/02/141002TGFSGoneGirl2.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/10/02/141002TGFSGoneGirl2_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/oct/03/gone-girl-you-night-draft-day-life-after-beth-video-reviews\">Gone Girl, You and the Night, Draft Day and Life After Beth: the Guardian film show</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Multiple narration is common in the modern psychological thriller. <em>The Girl on the Train</em> has three alternating narrators. <em>Gone Girl</em> shifts back and forth between the narratives of Nick and of Amy. No one can quite be trusted. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of the lie of omission,\u201d Nick tells us in <em>Gone Girl</em>. A candid admission of deceitfulness, it is the novel\u2019s way of alerting the reader to the need for suspicion. We are a third of the way through Flynn\u2019s novel before Nick happens to mention that he has been conducting a torrid affair with one of his students for the previous year (though the intermittent call alerts of his disposable mobile phone have already made us aware that his narrative was not complete). \u201cNow is the part where I have to tell you I have a mistress and you stop liking me \u2026 I have a pretty, young, very young mistress, and her name is Andie. I know. It\u2019s bad.\u201d (Worse in the film, where her age is reduced from 23 to 20.) \u201cMy vote for unreliable narrator of the year,\u201d declares one reviewer of <em>The Girl on the Train</em> in a quote reproduced on the cover of the British edition of the novel. A phrase \u2013 \u201cunreliable narrator\u201d \u2013 coined in the early 1960s by a little known American prof, Wayne C Booth, in a densely academic book, <em>The Rhetoric of Fiction</em>, has become a standard term in book reviews and publishers\u2019 puffs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Collins\u2019s febrile states often surface in today\u2019s thrillers as characters question their own fears and memories</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Collins liked to experiment with different narrators. His longest and most complicated novel, <em>Armadale</em>, begins as a conventional third-person narrative, but then expands to include letters and first-person testimonies, and finally, grippingly, a diary written by the villain Lydia Gwilt, a formidably intelligent, red-haired governess, a murderer and a blackmailer, who uses her sexual allure to trick men. (One contemporary reviewer called her \u201cLydia Guilt\u201d by mistake). She is fond of quoting Byron\u2019s poetry and for relaxation plays Beethoven sonatas on the piano. Though ruthless, she finds herself falling in love with one of her intended victims. Eventually, her love for him prevents her gaining the fortune she seeks. She schemes to cheat the novel\u2019s hero out of his inheritance, finally deceiving him into spending the night in a private asylum in Hampstead, where, with the assistance of the corrupt alienist Dr Downward, she attempts to murder him with poison gas as he sleeps. All this would be so much melodrama if we did not have her own account, and in particular the journal in which she records her mental torments as well as her infernal plotting.</p> <p>The documents that make up Collins\u2019s narratives are not inert records: they become part of the story. In <em>The Woman in White</em>, in a coup de theatre that would be called postmodern if it happened in a novel of the early 21st century, the diary written by the novel\u2019s wonderfully resourceful heroine, Marian Halcombe, which we have been reading for more than a hundred pages, is suddenly interrupted by a \u201cPostscript by a Sincere Friend\u201d. With a chill we realise that the new narrator is the ingenious villain Count Fosco himself, relishing the \u201cunexpected intellectual pleasure\u201d he has taken from reading the journal of the woman who has been trying to frustrate his nefarious schemes against her sister, Laura. Marian has fallen ill and he has purloined her narrative, joining the disconcerted reader in praising her talents and her courage. \u201cYes! These pages are amazing\u201d, and increase his admiration of \u201cthis sublime creature\u201d. \u201cThe presentation of my own character is masterly in the extreme.\u201d How he regrets that he and she are foes. \u201cI condole with her on the inevitable failure of every plan that she has formed for her sister\u2019s benefit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17ff3e92308b3dcb229cfd3c0af0a8197899fb0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17ff3e92308b3dcb229cfd3c0af0a8197899fb0a/0_83_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Mcavoy in the film adaptation of Atonement (2007).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Mcavoy in the film adaptation of Atonement (2007).

In <em>Gone Girl</em> \u2013 in a narrative twist that the film version of the story found hard to replicate \u2013 the apparently ingenuous diary being written by Amy turns out to be her device. \u201cThe diary, yes! We\u2019ll get to my brilliant diary.\u201d We are more than halfway through the book before we discover \u2013 one of those overturnings of expectations that Collins relished \u2013 that this diary, one of the narrative threads that we have been following, is a fiction Amy is using to incriminate her husband. It has become a familiar trick of literary fiction (Ian McEwan uses it in both <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/atonement.html\"><em>Atonement</em></a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/sweet-tooth.html\"><em>Sweet Tooth</em></a>), but is peculiarly suited to the psychological thriller. The firm narrative ground disappears from under our feet. Collins\u2019s interest in unsettling our confidence in a narrative is what makes him seem so modern. One of the first reviewers of <em>Armadale</em> noted shrewdly, \u201cIf it were the object of art to make one\u2019s audience uncomfortable, without letting them know why, Mr Wilkie Collins would be beyond all doubt a consummate artist.\u201d</p> <p>Collins turned the apprehensions of his characters into the stuff of his fiction. \u201cNervous\u201d is one of his favourite adjectives: characters suffer \u201cnervous restlessness\u201d or \u201cnervous dread\u201d or \u201cviolent nervous agitation\u201d. Often their \u201cnerves\u201d are \u201cshaken\u201d; sometimes they are \u201cshattered\u201d. They are sensitised to the terrors of the plots in which they find themselves entangled. Their febrile states still often surface in psychological thrillers, as characters question their own fears and perceptions. Rachel, the main narrator in <em>The Girl on the Train</em>, descends from Collins. A partially recovering alcoholic, she struggles to tell the difference between her memory and her imagination. She is not sure what she saw on the night that a woman disappeared. Much of Hawkins\u2019s novel is narrated in the present tense, enacting the feverishness of its main characters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6aa6c483da58b43c767ea36a924aba5a5b49fae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6aa6c483da58b43c767ea36a924aba5a5b49fae/0_0_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Watson in the film adaptation of The Girl on the Train.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Blunt as Rachel Watson in the film adaptation of The Girl on the Train. Photograph: Allstar/Dreamworks SKG</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Dreamworks SKG</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of these are women and it has frequently been noted that contemporary psychological thrillers often feature \u201cdifficult\u201d female protagonists. (In an article in the London Review of Books, critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jacquelinerose\">Jacqueline Rose</a> arraigned both Flynn and Hawkins for producing post-feminist fiction that in fact encouraged \u201chatred of women\u201d.) Collins invariably put women \u2013 usually unconventional, difficult women \u2013 at the centre of his novels. In <em>No Name</em>, the resourceful Magdalen Vanstone uses disguise and elaborate deceit to try to win back her rightful inheritance. In <em>Armadale</em> the notional protagonist, Alan Armadale, is an impetuous, good\u2011hearted bore, but the villainess, Gwilt, is constantly surprising and intriguing. Collins felt and wrote passionately about the injustices that women suffered as a result of illiberal marriage and divorce laws, and intolerant attitudes to \u201cfallen women\u201d. After <em>The Moonstone</em> he started using his novels rather too bluntly to campaign on such issues. But he had shown later novelists how to combine narrative suspense with psychological complexity.</p> <p>His novels have their Victorian preoccupations, naturally. They always depend on arcane legal issues, usually to do with the conditions of wills and rights of inheritance, about which Collins took detailed advice from lawyer friends. He had had a legal training, though he never practised as a lawyer, and was an avid reader of accounts of trials. Each of his novels also satisfied his first readers by achieving something like poetic justice at its conclusion. He knew that the Victorian public demanded happy endings. Yet his readers were also invited to glimpse the possibility that crimes could go unpunished. In a memorable exchange in <em>The Woman in White</em>, Count Fosco undermines the confidence expressed by Marian and Laura that \u201ccrimes cause their own detection\u201d. Only if the criminal is a fool, he retorts. The Count strokes his pet mice and laughs \u201cinwardly and silently\u201d at the pious thought that criminal deeds bring retribution. \u201cAsk Coroners who sit at inquests in large towns if that is true, Lady Glyde. Ask secretaries of life-assurance companies if that is true, Miss Halcombe. Read your own public journals.\u201d All around them crimes take place that are not even identified as such \u2013 \u201cbodies that are not found\u201d and \u201cwise criminals who escape\u201d. Those crimes are still there for novelists to uncover.</p> <ul> <li><em>The Moonstone</em> begins on 30 October on BBC1.<br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>In these troubled climatic times, skiers and snowboarders can no longer rely on adequate snow cover throughout the season. So planning is vital.

  "<h2>Snapshot: Larking around at the&#xa0;tea hut in 1934</h2> <p>That\u2019s me on the left, my sister Joan on the right and our friend Phyllis in the middle. I can\u2019t remember what we were laughing about, but Joan and I were always larking around. Dad worked on the railway and didn\u2019t earn much, so Mum, who was business-minded, was always trying to find ways&#xa0;to earn extra money.</p> <p>This empty tea hut stood on the London to Southend road near Cranham, Essex, so my mum saw an opportunity and got permission for us to use the hut to sell ice-cream, tea and cold drinks to passing cyclists at the weekends. You would get to know the customers, the same old faces. The odd car would come along.</p> <p>I was only 14 in this picture. Mum and Dad kept having babies, year after year, 12 in all. Apart from being my sister, Joan was my best friend. We had to do everything together, looking after our baby brothers and sisters as they came along. Joan is still here, but lives in a home now and we don\u2019t see very much of each other.</p> <p>War broke out on my 18th birthday. That was the last of the summers at the tea hut. By that time, I had a job at Woolworths in Brentwood. After work, my friend Dot and I used to go to the town hall dances and, beforehand, we used to go into the Green Lantern cafe. One day, two soldiers walked in, one very tall and good looking and another shorter. Obviously listening to our conversation (about new nylon stockings that had come in to store), the tall, good-looking soldier turned around and said, \u201cExcuse me, ladies! Can you tell me where I can get those so I can buy some for my wife?\u201d I&#xa0;turned to the other soldier and said cheekily, \u201cI suppose you would like some for your wife, too?\u201d</p> <p>And he said, \u201cYes, I would, if I had one! Will you marry me?\u201d</p> <p>And that was Ivan. The next day, he walked into Woolworths, having bought some lights for my bike \u2013 he was worried about me cycling home in the dark. He walked straight over to my sister Joan\u2019s counter and handed over the lights to her; with us looking so similar, he had confused Joan for me, until the penny dropped. The first of many laughs and many wonderful years married to Ivan until he died eight years ago.</p> <p>I turned 95 on 3 September and some of my remaining siblings travelled up for my birthday lunch. I don\u2019t know where the years have gone. We had a wonderful childhood really. We didn\u2019t have much, but we were so happy.</p> <p><em>Winnie White</em></p> <h2>Playlist: The song I was sick of,&#xa0;but grew to love</h2> <p><strong>Moondance by Van Morrison</strong></p> <p>\u201c<em>Well, it\u2019s a marvellous night for a moondance / With the stars up above in&#xa0;your eyes / A fantabulous night to make romance / \u2019Neath the cover of October skies</em>\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIsV2v04IHk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zIsV2v04IHk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>When I was little, we didn\u2019t visit my grandparents a lot because of the two-hour drive it took to get there.

It had a cassette deck. And because we had no cassette player at home, we didn\u2019t have many cassettes. To be specific, we had one: Moondance by Van Morrison. And every other weekend, my dad would play it on the drive up to my grandmother\u2019s, and he would play it on the drive back, until I knew every single word.</p> <p>Needless to say, I started to get sick of the album.</p> <p>The car was stolen in 2010, with the cassette in the glovebox.</p> <p>However, recently I saw a CD of the album, and although I only had bad memories of listening to it, I just had to buy it.</p> <p>And when I got home and I listened to it, I absolutely loved it.

  "<p>Nina Willner\u2019s childhood was, on the surface, little different from that of her classmates in Kansas, deep in America\u2019s midwest. School, piano lessons, sports matches, camping trips, television, plenty of food: Nina \u2013 and in due course her five siblings \u2013 enjoyed the trappings of 1960s suburban America. There was, though, Nina realised, one large difference. Her friends had grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins. Where, she asked aged five, were hers?</p> <p>The explanation was baffling. \u201cWe learned they were behind an iron curtain. What do you mean they can\u2019t get out? A curtain, wait, I\u2019ll go pull that aside,\u201d recalls Nina, now 55. It was, she vaguely understood, no ordinary bit of window dressing. \u201cIt must be huge. I thought it must go up to the sky. I somehow realised we were lucky.\u201d</p> <p>Nina\u2019s mother, Hanna, had grown up in the village of Schwaneberg, about 100 miles south-west of Berlin. She was 17 when, with the second world war over, Russian troops rolled in. Germany was being carved up among the allied victors and the villagers were now in Soviet-controlled East Germany.</p> <p>As life grew harder \u2013 with food, land and the school curriculum taken over by the Communist party and the zone\u2019s borders ever more harshly policed \u2013 Hanna became increasingly unhappy. In&#xa0;1948, a&#xa0;week before she was due to collect her high-school diploma, she bought a return train ticket to the city of Magdeburg, telling her family she was going to register at teacher training college. But she was really planning to escape. Two previous attempts to reach the West had left her fully aware of the risks. She&#xa0;had been fired on. Her family was already being watched.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"37e5ce2b3946854e80b538380c064b8ca2c88785\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37e5ce2b3946854e80b538380c064b8ca2c88785/0_45_2783_1670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nina Willner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nina Willner: \u2018The reunion was epic\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy Nina Willner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On this occasion, she tagged on to a group who were trying to cross. They made a dash for the border and guards shot at them. The rest of the group was rounded up, but Hanna hid in a barn where a woman and her son were living. When the guards came looking, the woman pretended Hanna was her niece. The son had struck&#xa0;up a relationship of sorts with the guards, giving them things in return for letting him cross back and forth. He told them Hanna was his cousin visiting her grandmother in the West, handed over cigarettes and she got through.</p> <p>She had nothing with her but a small case containing a photograph of her parents and seven siblings, 10 marks and a warm jumper.</p> <p>\u201cIt was heartbreaking for my mother. She was little more than a teenager,\u201d says Nina.</p> <p>Hanna settled in Heidelberg, where she learned English, found a job with the US army and married a serviceman, Eddie, an Auschwitz survivor with American citizenship. In 1960, the couple moved back to America, where Nina was born.</p> <p>It would be 40 years before Hanna and her family were reunited.</p> <p>In November 1989, Hanna and Nina (by then herself the mother of two young children) watched stunned as images of the Berlin Wall being torn down were relayed on American TV.</p> <p>\u201cWe just couldn\u2019t get it into our heads. It took days to sink in,\u201d says Nina. \u201cMy mother kept waiting to hear that the borders had been closed again.\u201d In East Germany, Nina learned later, her relatives were even more shocked and wary. \u201cThey thought it was another trick to ferret out the non-believers.\u201d</p> <p>Five months later, Hanna and Eddie flew to Frankfurt to meet her five surviving siblings and their families. \u201cWhen the reunion came, it was epic,\u201d says Nina. \u201cThere were tears for months and months. They knew the family could have been destroyed. Everybody knew what it meant to come back together. And everybody knew what they lost in those 40 years.\u201d</p> <p>Hanna\u2019s parents had died, as had three of her brothers \u2013 Roland, the oldest and Hanna\u2019s favourite, only one year earlier. \u201cThat was very tough.\u201d In all the years of separation, says Nina, Hanna never resigned herself to losing her family.</p> <p>\u201cLetters, when they did get through, were already open and usually devoid of information.\u201d Letters announcing the deaths of two brothers were withheld, Hanna only finding out through devastatingly oblique references a year later.</p> <p>On the bureau in her bedroom, recalls Nina, Hanna kept the few photographs she had. \u201cThere was a family frozen in time, her brothers as little boys. I would look them over and wonder who they really were.\u201d</p> <p>To a large extent, to Nina if not to her mother, this proof of existence was enough. \u201cMy father\u2019s family had all died in the Holocaust so having this side of the family \u2013 even if we couldn\u2019t actually see them \u2013 was particularly important.\u201d</p> <p>Nina enjoyed helping her mother to pack parcels. \u201cShe was always packing boxes. Clothes, knitted blankets, food, soaps, cigarettes, trinkets, nail clippers, anything she could think they might need.\u201d Few parcels reached their destination. Cigars, clothes, grapefruit were&#xa0;all intercepted. There were occasional successes, though. A swimming costume sent for Nina\u2019s cousin Cordula \u2013 a promising athlete who was later selected for East Germany\u2019s cycling team \u2013 was particularly treasured.</p> <p>Though Nina would not meet Cordula until after the fall of the wall, their paths had almost crossed earlier. After graduating in 1982, Nina joined the US army as an intelligence officer. She was posted to Berlin, undertaking regular reconnaissance missions into East Berlin at the same time Cordula was training in the city\u2019s velodrome.</p> <p>\u201cThe moment we passed through Checkpoint Charlie I knew we were in my mother\u2019s family\u2019s country. They were somewhere there,\u201d says Nina. \u201cThe contrast with the West was stark. We were followed immediately. There was very little movement, few people around. It felt eerie, grey, dark. It gave me a much clearer sense of what my mother \u2013 who always had so much spirit \u2013 had escaped.\u201d</p> <p>During one visit from her parents, Nina arranged a bus tour into East Berlin. Hanna, immediately struck by anxiety, was unable to complete the outing. \u201cShe was safe. We were with the US army, but she felt so frightened she couldn\u2019t get off the bus.\u201d It was, for&#xa0;Nina, an important moment. \u201cI&#xa0;had&#xa0;never seen her like that. It was a&#xa0;visceral reaction. I understood.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Nina is delighted that her children can enjoy the extended family she once missed. \u201cWe all visit. We talk. We send pictures. I even get weekly reports from my aunt Heidi on what is growing in the garden. We all know how important it is.

  "<p>F<em>resh Fruit Crumble</em>, <em>Ice Cream</em> and <em>A Glass of Red</em> are three of the prints by Howard Hodgkin on show at the new premises of the Alan Cristea Gallery in London. Luscious, edible colours make the subject matter of the otherwise abstract images absolutely clear. Food has been one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/26/howard-hodgkin-witty-glittery-proust-painters\">Hodgkin\u2019s subjects over the years</a>. Other prints take places and the weather for their subjects: <em>Blue Evening</em>, <em>Dark Rainbow</em>, and <em>Foreign Garden</em>. Others still unspecified experiences: <em>Surprise Surprise</em>, <em>Absolutely</em> and <em>Outspoken</em>.</p> <p>All have the sensuous immediacy familiar from Hodgkin\u2019s work over the decades. He once described his paintings (ostensibly abstract) as representational images of emotional situations. His prints, which he has been making for more than six decades, aim for a different directness: getting right up close to the experience of things, whetting the appetite, lulling you with beauty, bringing back the smell of rain or old leaves. Each image is a moment of visual intoxication.</p> <p>It was Alan Cristea who convinced Hodgkin that his 1995 series of Venice prints should not be his last, and has cajoled him to return to the difficult and demanding medium. For a painter used to working alone in the studio, producing unique pieces, often over a number of years, the collaborative effort of making prints requires some mental adjustment. Cristea has gently fuelled Hodgkin\u2019s ambition over the past 30 years, and in 2012 the artist made two prints, titled <em>As Time Goes By</em> which, at more than six metres long, are the largest etchings ever made. When asked by an interviewer why he had made such large prints, Hodgkin replied: \u201cTo show that I could\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c3ea185a0bcefd2a4ac9d0704ba8472aef13ed4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c3ea185a0bcefd2a4ac9d0704ba8472aef13ed4/0_0_2500_2153/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Surprise Surprise.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"861\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Surprise Surprise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Howard Hodgkin and Alan Cristea Gallery, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hodgkin came into his stride as a printmaker in the late 1970s. It was at this moment that, through the use of new techniques, the prints began to become equivalents, or \u201csurrogates\u201d, as Hodgkin once put it, for his paintings; things in their own right. One of the earliest prints in the current exhibition, from 1977, shows a dark mass against a sodden light blue background and is titled <em>A Storm</em>. It was made in New York after hearing of terrible storms in Oklahoma, where Hodgkin had recently travelled, which reminded him of the stormy skies in the paintings of <a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/77438/15-things-you-might-not-know-about-thomas-hart-benton\">Thomas Hart Benton</a>.</p> <p>A few years later Hodgkin began using carborundum, a sticky, lava-like substance, which is applied direct to the printing plate using brush or fingers. (The process had been invented 20 years earlier by Henri Goetz, a printmaker who worked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2012/feb/08/antoni-tapies-art-in-pictures\">Antoni T\u00e0pies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/mar/20/joan-miro-life-ladder-escape-tate\">Joan Mir\u00f3</a>.) The rich, textured mark it produces was a perfect answer to Hodgkin\u2019s desire to get away from the fussiness of traditional printmaking, and the reliance on the drawn, rather than painted mark. The four <em>Venetian Views </em>from 1995, combinations of etching, aquatint and carborundum (one is on view in the new show), which came out of an aborted project to illustrate Thomas Mann\u2019s <em>Death in Venice</em>, were intended to defy the physical limits of printmaking and immerse the viewer in colours and forms.</p> <p>Above all it is through hand-colouring that Hodgkin achieves his immersive effect. He didn\u2019t invent the technique, which has been used for centuries as a way of adding colour by hand to brighten up a monochrome prints, but he has made it his own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ee200ef25cd05f41d3cfe2c7e93f6ec9a314c3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ee200ef25cd05f41d3cfe2c7e93f6ec9a314c3f/0_0_2500_1718/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ice Cream.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ice Cream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Howard Hodgkin and Alan Cristea Gallery, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No artist has used it with such consistency, and to such great effect. Each of the 30 prints in the edition of <em>Ice Cream</em>, for example, were made in this way; Hodgkin paints an artist\u2019s proof, noting the type of brush used, and the exact mix of paint. A master printmaker, in this case Andrew Smith, who has been hand-colouring Hodgkin\u2019s prints for a number of years, then reproduces Hodgkin\u2019s brushstrokes with fiendish accuracy, using exactly the same brushes and colours, mimicking also the direction and angle of application, the pressure and small movements of the hand that make the marks distinctive.</p> <p>At first Hodgkin provided the person doing the hand-colouring with evocative instructions on how to apply the colour: \u201clike a silk stocking\u201d, for example, or \u201ctoo much is just enough\u201d or, more controversially, \u201cjust like hitting a baby\u201d (an old English expression, Hodgkin explains). They sound a bit like Eric Satie\u2019s directions on his musical scores, all the more direct for being so strangely allusive: \u201clight as an egg\u201d, \u201cfrom the top of your back teeth\u201d and, most memorably, \u201clike a nightingale with a toothache\u201d. Smith has become so adept at reproducing Hodgkin\u2019s marks that he no longer needs instructions, or even to watch the original mark being made, but can tell exactly how any brushstroke was made simply by looking at it, and feeling the weight of personality behind it.</p> <p>Are the prints any less original for having not been touched by the artist\u2019s hand? Nowadays you can go into most successful artists\u2019 studios and find a small team of assistants completing the paintings to order. But replicating, by hand, a highly complex and expressive mark is something else, a matter both of technical skill and empathy \u2013 or a combination of \u201csensitivity and politesse\u201d, as Hodgkin says of Smith. It\u2019s a uniquely personal approach to an impersonal technique. Andy Warhol (who once invited Hodgkin to make a print celebrating the 1984 Winter Olympics) would surely have been jealous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48ca7667d4bb21a2d9173d87fbc1a56100d6709b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48ca7667d4bb21a2d9173d87fbc1a56100d6709b/0_0_2500_1901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Absolutely.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"760\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Absolutely.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Howard Hodgkin and Alan Cristea Gallery, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hodgkin\u2019s ability to come up with such concise visual symbols for experience is also remarkable. <em>Dark Rainbow</em> shows two arcs of inky blue on a red swoosh, on a yellow ochre background. Whatever a dark rainbow is, this sums it up very well. <em>Autumn Sky</em> is made up from a yellow and blue strokes that mingle with black and white \u2013 not particularly autumnal colours, but the season is unmistakeable, just as it is with <em>Springtime</em>, even though enclosed by a thick black frame. <em>A Glass of Red</em> brings to mind the late Patrick Caulfield, Hodgkin\u2019s great friend, whose bare images of ordinary moments had a poetic intensity of their own. But Caulfield would never have produced an image so free and symbolic, like a hieroglyph, so visually unlike but then so utterly \u201cof\u201d a glass of red wine.</p> <p>It is often said that Hodgkin creates images based on memories, an act of Proustian recollection \u2013 an easy thought, but a lazy one. One also flatly contradicted by his prints, where he does not draw on experience, but creates it anew. Rather than being a sentimental painter, he is a realist, with all the pathos and comedy of that genre. Forget Proust\u2019s dainty madeleine; think rather of Flaubert\u2019s carp, in <em>Madame Bovary</em>, gasping for air on the kitchen table, a symbol of unquenchable desire \u2013 that\u2019s at least what the large print <em>Big Sister</em> brings to mind, a flurry of dark brushstrokes against a yellow ochre frame. And everything else on the kitchen table is right there in front of you: good enough to eat.</p> <p><em>Howard Hodgkin: After All </em>is at Alan Cristea Gallery, London SW1 until 18 November. <a href=\"http://www.alancristea.com/schedule.php\">alancristea.com</a></p>",
