His showmanship, effeminate appearance and fondness for sequins and shiny shirts overcame the gender stereotypes of a chauvinist society, while his lyrics about love and loss spoke to all.</p> <p>That Juanga overcame hardships in early life \u2013 he was orphaned at a young age along with his nine siblings, and later served 18 months in prison on robbery charges \u2013 to hit the big time, only added to the appeal of a performer with whom the often oppressed masses could easily identify.</p> <p>\u201cThere was definitely this transcendence from high-brow to low-brow with Juan Gabriel. He straddled all the social classes,\u201d says Esteban Illades, editor of Nexos, a high-brow Mexican magazine. \u201cHe didn\u2019t write about social problems, he didn\u2019t write about the economy.

I saw how they looked at him. They did it with curiosity, but above all with a certain fascination.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel was believed to be gay, but he never publicly confirmed this, despite attracting hoardes of male fans in a country with a heavy culture of machismo. He once told a television presenter pushing the issue: \u201cThey say you don\u2019t ask about what\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJuan Gabriel was a true punk,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yuri_herrera/status/770027056935690240\">tweeted writer Yuri Herrera</a>. \u201cIn a country of machos, he danced as he damn well pleased.\u201d</p> <p>Despite widespread adoration, Juanga was known to court controversy, occasionally entering the political fray. In 2000, he propped up the incumbent Institutional Revolutionary party, penning a song for its 2000 election campaign as the country was preparing to cast aside its one-party rule.</p> <p>His views are expected to become better known in his death. His lawyer told the media that Juanga wrote a letter for her to deliver to the president, telling \u201cfor the first time how he sees the country\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>The crisis in and around the \u201cJungle\u201d refugee camp near Calais is worse than ever, according to aid agencies and road hauliers, with increased overcrowding and poor sanitary conditions, and a rise in violent attacks on lorry drivers heading to the UK.</p> <p>The number of people in the camp has reached an all-time high of almost 10,000, months after the French authorities dismantled a significant part of the camp.</p> <p>Daniel Barney, of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), which opened a health centre in the camp, said the French and UK governments were turning a blind eye to the growing problems.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/uk-plays-down-calais-border-tensions-with-critical-ally-france\">UK and France restate commitment to border treaty after Calais talks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said the French authorities\u2019 decision to demolish part of the camp had made the situation worse. \u201cHalf the camp was dismantled. So now we have double the population living in half as much land, with access to the same amount of water points and toilets. There is an extreme problem of overcrowding. Conditions in the camp are getting progressively worse.\u201d</p> <p>Hunger is increasingly a problem. Jack Steadman, of the charity <a href=\"http://www.helprefugees.org.uk/\">HelpRefugees</a>, said: \u201cIn the past six weeks, medical volunteers have reported that people are complaining that they are hungry, which did not happen previously. The food distribution systems are stretched to the maximum.\u201d </p> <p>Approximately 7,000 meals a day are being distributed, and queueing for food can take more than an hour. \u201cEven if people only eat one meal a day, it\u2019s obviously not enough to feed a camp of almost 10,000. We can\u2019t keep up with the increase in population,\u201d Steadman said.</p> <p>Asylum seekers said they were terrified by the violence in and around the camp and the apparent unwillingness of either the French or UK governments to intervene.</p> <p>Mary (not her real name), 21, of the persecuted Oromo ethnic group in Ethiopia, fled in May 2015 and has been in the Calais camp for more than a year. Her husband, whom she travelled with to France, managed to continue on to the UK last year, where his asylum claim has been accepted, but she has been unable to join him.</p> <p>She said she would welcome the opportunity to claim asylum in Britain legally from France, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/29/uk-warned-calais-border-deal-is-in-danger\">as proposed by Nicolas Sarkozy</a>, who has called for the 2003 Le Touquet agreement to be scrapped. But she was increasingly pessimistic about the prospect of any political intervention to improve the situation.</p> <p>It was very dangerous for a single woman to attempt to travel illegally to the UK, she said. A female friend died recently when she was hit by a car on the motorway while trying to get on to a lorry. Others had been raped, she said; a young boy she knew had lost a leg and suffered severe burns in a fire in the camp. </p> <p>\u201cFire engines don\u2019t come here. People die here every day, but the French and British government already know this. People are dying here, women are being raped, people are suffering. They know the situation, and they don\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>Volunteers said more people were choosing to claim asylum in France rather than attempt to travel to the UK, but were finding that the asylum process was protracted and very oversubscribed.</p> <p>MSF is concerned about increased instances of respiratory diseases and the skin infection scabies. French health officials found 377 cases of scabies in the camp in their last assessment.</p> <p>George Gabriel, of <a href=\"http://www.citizensuk.org/\">Citizens UK</a>, a group campaigning on behalf of children stranded in the camp, said people were staying for far longer. \u201cOn average people spend seven months in the camp, whereas this time last year most hadn\u2019t been here for more than two or three weeks. So Calais is increasingly becoming a warehouse of desperate souls, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/what-am-i-waiting-for-child-refugees-trapped-in-calais-appeal-to-mps\">children seeking to reach their loved ones unable to get across</a>, and trapped between two of the richest countries on Earth.\u201d</p> <p>In May it was hoped that the introduction of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/04/britain-failing-child-refugees-europe-help-them-fast\">Dubs</a> amendment would help unaccompanied children come to the UK. But since then none have arrived. Citizens UK estimates there are more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/call-to-bring-child-refugees-in-calais-under-uk-safeguarding-rules\">800 unaccompanied minors in the camp</a>, many of whom Gabriel said were becoming increasingly desperate.</p> <p>\u201cWe saw two children die over the last nine months after jumping on the back of lorries, because there was no sign that the system was ever going to work for them,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/lorry-drivers-in-calais-share-your-experiences\">Lorry drivers in Calais: share your experiences</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Timber is no longer allowed in the camp, preventing volunteers from building better accommodation for migrants, and forcing them to remain in tents.

They want to avoid creating a pull factor, but people are pushed here by persecution and war.\u201d</p> <p>There are currently almost 10,000 people of 30 different nationalities living next to each other in a 1.5 sq km area. On Tuesday afternoon French police sprayed teargas at the entrance to the camp; it was unclear why.</p> <p>Verona Murphy, president of Irish Road Haulage Association, who visited the camp last month, said the number of violent attacks against lorry drivers was \u201cworse than ever. And the migrants are more brazen than ever.\u201d</p> <p>Lorry drivers report being attacked with stones, metal bars and wooden stakes. Joseph Druhan, who has been driving lorries through Calais for more than 40 years, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d He said he seen seen vehicles attacked with bolt cutters, chainsaws and angle grinders by migrants trying to stow away in trucks.</p> <p>\u201cYears ago we had the eastern Europeans, but they weren\u2019t malicious or violent like these boys. They never attack the drivers in daylight hours. Probably they are desperate. It is the traffickers that we should be going at.\u201d</p> <p>He said drivers were offered \u00a35,000 per person to take stowaways. \u201cIf you are in Calais you see BMW and Mercedes going into the Jungle, and they are not first aid people. It\u2019s a well-organised operation.\u201d</p> <p>Mick Young, whose truck was attacked near Calais by a group of refugees earlier this year, said it was only a matter of time before a driver was killed. Three weeks ago he said he witnessed migrants climbing on top of queueing caravans and smashing in the skylights to get in. \u201cSomebody will be killed, definitely,\u201d he said.</p> <p></p> <p></p>",
  "<p>Anyone who witnessed the almost unbearable drama of Heather Watson coming within <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2015/jul/03/serena-williams-v-heather-watson-wimbledon-2015-live\" title=\"\">two points of beating Serena Williams at Wimbledon last year</a> would struggle to recognise her as the same player who went out of the US Open in straight sets here on day two to Richel Hogenkamp, a 24-year-old Dutch qualifier ranked 135 in the world.</p> <p>There were extenuating circumstances. Watson\u2019s back looked to give up on her and Hogenkamp raised her game to a level she had rarely hit before in her career to win 6-2, 7-5. This was her first win in the main draw of a big tournament.</p> <p>The biggest win of her career, by far, was over the former slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in more than four hours in a Fed Cup match this year, the longest in the history of the competition. If that was an earthquake, this was at least an earth tremor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/29/johanna-konta-starts-us-open-campaign-with-victory-over-bethanie-mattek-sands\">Johanna Konta starts US Open campaign with victory over Bethanie Mattek-Sands</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Watson was a break down within 10 minutes on the wide open Court Four on another hot, slow-wind day, the thermometer hitting 26C (80F) before noon, and humidity rising to 59%. This is their workplace, but it is not an easy environment.</p> <p>It was getting increasingly grim for Watson; within 20 minutes she trailed 1-4, unable to get her serve clicking and hitting one sloppy forehand after another. When Hogenkamp went 5-2 up, Watson went to her chair on the changeover and dropped her head into her hands. The Guernsey player thereafter could not get going in attack, hitting a single winner in the first set, and seemed at a loss to handle the all-round competence of Hogenkamp.</p> <p>As the sun beat relentlessly on their heads, Watson took a long while at the end of the first set sitting under an umbrella held over her by a patient ballkid, as Hogenkamp idled her time away nearby with an ice pack on her head: elite tennis at its most brutal.</p> <p>With anxious staff hovering, Watson spoke at length with two medical attendants, and seemed to indicate she was having trouble moving her torso. The tears began to flow as they counselled her, and she asked to lie down on court as the physio manipulated her left side.</p> <p>After about 10 minutes, Watson went to the service line to start the second set. The best rally of the match ensued, as she chased down one clever angled shot after another, before finishing the point with one of her own, for 15-all. Whatever ailed her seemed to have passed. It was an illusion.</p> <p>Hogenkamp let her off the hook on break point and Watson held, grateful for any favours. The irony was the Dutch player, who showed no signs of distress, had at this point hit twice as many unforced errors as her stricken foe, and twice as many winners \u2013 so clearly was playing with freedom.</p> <p>Hogenkamp had lost only two points on her first serve after just under an hour of stop-start tennis. Watson was finding it tough to get a break. The British player had spoken earlier of the advantage of coming into the main draw through the qualifying tournament, and certainly Hogenkamp was moving with confidence, sure in the shot and, despite her inexperience at the highest level, playing without fear.</p> <p>Watson\u2019s movement \u2013 normally snappy and athletic \u2013 was sluggish by comparison. Every game since she had held serve at the start of the match, she found herself in a dogfight of her own making just to hold, and she was broken again in the third game. She doubled up in distress on her chair again at the changeover.</p> <p>Watson had held just twice in the match and had to red-line through deuce to get to 2-3. She then seemed to get a burst of energy from nowhere and was grateful for a Hogenkamp double-fault to gift her the break and parity in the sixth game. However, a double fault and a couple of sloppy errors handed the break back.</p> <p>This was slow, sweaty torture for Watson, but she broke back immediately when her forehand clipped the net and trickled over.</p> <p>True to script, Watson served a double fault and an ace to hold, and the pressure shifted across the net for the first time in the match as Hogenkamp stepped up to stay in the set. She served just her second ace of the match for deuce, then Watson failed to cash in on a weak second serve and the chance passed.</p> <p>Watson\u2019s suspect back seized up again in the 11th game, at precisely the wrong moment of her brief fightback. Clearly in pain, with her serve barely of club-player speed, she handed Hogenkamp three break points, two of which the Dutch player squandered before going 6-5 up in what turned out to be the longest game of the match.</p> <p>Hogenkamp could hardly believe it when Watson did not chase down a regulation return in midcourt, and was relieved when the British player put her final forehand long.</p> <p>Watson was wrecked, physically and spiritually, as she dragged herself off court in tears, and on to the treatment table.</p>",

For half a century, the iconography of summer and the bikini have been almost interchangeable. A bikini, a tan, a beach: that was what summer should look like. But the bikini is in decline. Retailers report a rise in sales for one-piece swimsuits \u2013 30% year on year at Selfridges, 65% at online retailer Figleaves \u2013 while Victoria\u2019s Secret are closing their \u201cSwim\u201d line, which was weighted towards skimpy bikinis, and plan to use the space in store to expand the athleisure offering.</p> <p>In the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/french-mayors-burkini-ban-court-ruling\" title=\"\">the burkini controversy</a>, it would be easy to pin the demise of the bikini as collateral damage in the culture war currently being fought on Europe\u2019s beaches. That the burkini represents a level of threat such that it must be resisted with armed police reflects how the beliefs around women\u2019s bodies for which this garment stands are, rightly or wrongly, perceived as a clear and present danger. But while it is temptingly neat to plot the bikini\u2019s fall as a status symbol against the rise of modesty wear as a political issue, the reality is not that simple.</p> <p>The problem is not that the bikini is too sexy for 2016. The problem is that the bikini represents a wholesome, respectable, entirely non-controversial level of sex appeal which simply no longer exists. This is not just about politics. It is about how the internet\u2019s easy access to never-ending nudity rendered the bikini anachronistic: in the era of NSFW images, the sedate two-piece is losing its allure. And it is also about the escalation of hostilities in the field of body image, and how the very phrase \u201cbikini body\u201d has become controversial, representing an ideal we love to hate. The bikini triumphed for the second half of the 20th century because it represented an ideal of sex, summer, freedom and youth which was saucy enough to be compelling, but not fundamentally controversial.</p> <p>To feel good in a bikini was an aspirational idea but \u2013 until the age of the photoshopped selfie and the Insta-model, when the body ideal became impossible \u2013 not an unrealistic or alienating concept. For all its flimsiness, the bikini stood for a consensus that is now under attack \u2013 and not from one enemy, but from all sides. The whole point of the bikini was that it was both gently provocative and entirely respectable, a line which it is increasingly difficult to walk.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the era of NSFW images, the sedate two-piece is losing its allure</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The rise of the burkini was foreshadowed by that of the kaftan. As the power-tanning of the 1980s and early 1990s hazed into the bohemian, health-conscious millennium and noughties, the kaftan was added to the packing pile. Awareness about the dangers of sun damage rose, the need to maximise the surface area of tanned skin fell away, and a whole new industry of \u201cbeach fashion\u201d \u2013 cover-ups, tummy chains, gold tattoos \u2013 grew to fill a space once occupied by the need to get brown. Simultaneously, the rise of paparazzi click-bait created a new, confidence-battering image bank. If you weren\u2019t haunted by the photos of actresses looking ridiculously gorgeous, you were haunted by the photos which proved even ridiculously gorgeous actresses sometimes look awful on the beach. Suddenly, women were wearing more clothes on the beach. The high-street kaftan unwittingly drove modesty creep on the beach long before the burkini, but thanks to its more easily mood-boardable aesthetic \u2013 60s bohemian Marrakesh, rather than 21st-century Saudi \u2013 nobody noticed, or cared.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36466825a65182801ff05e9fb637e916bcbc31c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36466825a65182801ff05e9fb637e916bcbc31c7/0_740_3108_1973/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brigitte Bardot on the beach in classic mid-20th- century pose\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brigitte Bardot on the beach in classic mid-20th-century pose.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"547f3722e2e00e29044e1b832e23965c4d6228bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/547f3722e2e00e29044e1b832e23965c4d6228bb/0_0_439_589/373.jpg\" alt=\"Margot Robbie on the cover of the Vogue June 2016 edition\" width=\"373\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margot Robbie on the cover of the Vogue June 2016 edition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vogue</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before its impact was felt on bikinis, modesty creep had all but taken out topless sunbathing, once the norm on many beaches in France, Spain and Italy. Part of this, ironically, is down to sartorial norms from elsewhere being imposed on the beaches of Europe \u2013 not from Islamic culture, but from the US, where topless sunbathing was never standard behaviour. Recent generations of European teenagers have taken their beach dressing cues not from their mothers and grandmothers, but from American pop culture, where the top stays on. When Kate Moss mentioned in an interview three years ago that she sunbathed topless \u2013 \u201cI try to avoid a white boob\u201d was how she phrased it, with impressive devotion to the fashion singular \u2013 it was reported as evidence of her rebellious nature.</p> <p>There is a positive aspect to the triumph of the one-piece. That the new iconography of women\u2019s bodies is&#xa0;about sport and fitness \u2013 and, as such, takes its aesthetic cues from the all-in-ones of the racing pool, the gymnast\u2019s mat, or the dancer\u2019s studio \u2013 is progress, surely, from the bikini\u2019s none-too-subtle reference to&#xa0;the pairing of bra with knickers. But&#xa0;the bikini, in its pomp, represented fun and relaxation, semi-nudity without specific intent beyond that to read and doze and gossip and eat ice-creams. Who knew such simple pleasures would one day become so&#xa0;controversial?</p>",

The internet is an important part of the British economy but it is not necessarily where and how you gain power. In the 2015 general election, Labour\u2019s hubristic reliance on the social media echo chamber was one of the reasons it believed it was on course to win. It was wrong \u2014 and the team of Ed Miliband, Mr Corbyn\u2019s predecessor, was humiliated.</p> <p>There is no evidence that this has changed in the past year, and Mr Corbyn\u2019s promise to run \u201cthe most visible general election campaign ever\u201d confirms he does not have a strategy to counter the party\u2019s electioneering failures.

One of the proposals in his <em>Digital Democracy Manifesto</em> would be to end \u201cunjustified surveillance by CCTV\u201d, he said. Those of us who got the reference to Richard Branson\u2019s use of footage from CCTV on a Virgin train to attack the Labour leader could only applaud inwardly. Or would have done if the live video stream from the event hadn\u2019t gone down. </p> <p>I, for one, admire Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s attempt to restore the glory days of Windows 95, when the internet was swashbuckling and free and people spelled online with a hyphen. I share his vision of the information superhighway, based on high-speed dial-up for all. In particular, I like his idea for an Open Knowledge Library: if only someone could think of a catchy name for millions of computers all over the world, all connected to each other and sharing information without charge.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c59acfe4b0f6cb856287a7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-30T14:46:22.452Z\">3.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Hope Not Hate</strong>, the anti-racism campaign, is organising dozens of \u201cMore in Common\u201d community events around the UK this weekend to honour the values of the Labour MP Jo Cox who was killed in June.

The Nobel Prize-winning economist sits on Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s council of economic advisers and he said that Scotland should consider having its own currency if it opts for independence. Before the 2014 referendum the Scottish government\u2019s fiscal commission working group (part of the council of economic advisers) proposed an independent Scotland having a currency union with the rest of the UK. But this may have been a mistake, Stiglitz said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They wanted the smoothest transition possible. They wanted to say that we could move from the current economic arrangement to another one while keeping our currency and keeping other forms of institutions. I think, in hindsight, that may have been a mistake. </p> <p>It would be a mistake to join the euro, by the way, so what they would have needed to do, perhaps, was resurrect the Scottish pound and let it float. </p> <p>Small countries can have their own currency. The reason that Iceland, which had one of the deepest downturns in 2008, had one of the strongest recoveries was because it had its own currency.</p> <p>If there was a Scottish pound floating, you could help stimulate the Scottish economy. The deficit would come down to make it acceptable to joining the EU. </p> </blockquote> <p>Countries that join the EU - as an SNP-led independent Scotland would want to do, if by then the UK had left - are meant to commit to joining the euro.

This investment could be funded at minimal cost to the taxpayer and with the most rapid deployment possible, using the National Investment Bank and relying on all-time low government borrowing costs.

Building on existing fibre-optic roll-out schemes would reduce the total costs below this headline figure, and building on current practice we would look to schedule installations where the demand was urgent, such as to existing tech clusters.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85fd3430d53300d5778df9c6b485b1fd058fb8ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85fd3430d53300d5778df9c6b485b1fd058fb8ac/0_3_831_499/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c556d2e4b09fcabd06d2be\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-30T09:52:59.307Z\">10.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jeremy Corbyn's digital democracy speech</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> is speaking now.</p> <p>He says 20 years ago this speech would have been prepared at a desktop, at best.

He said that, provided the EU were \u201crational\u201d about it, Britain could do \u201cvery well\u201d on its own.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you can negotiate a reasonable deal, and what that means is if Europe is rational and says \u2018Okay, the people of the UK have spoken, we believe in economic integration, political integration, let\u2019s do the best we can within the constraints of what has been reflected by the people in the UK\u2019 - that would mean close trade ties, closer than the WTO, other forms of economic arrangement - I think it could do very well. And that\u2019s a little bit reflected on where the markets are today. </p> </blockquote> <p>He said that the US and Canada enjoyed \u201creal shared prosperity\u201d even though they had different currencies and no shared migration. The UK and the EU could develop a similar relationship, he suggested.</p> <p>Stiglitz also said he backed<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/29/brussels-ruling-could-hit-apple-with-billions-of-euros-in-back-taxes\"> the European commission\u2019s expected decision to rule against Apple\u2019s low-tax deal with the Irish government.</a> It was \u201cgreat\u201d that the EU was showing that big multinationals could not evade their tax responsibilities, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To me this is a real example of a moral depravity, if you want to think about it that way. These companies often talk about corporate responsibility. To my mind, the first corporate responsibility is paying your fair share of taxes. Unfortunately, the mindset of a lot of corporate CEOs is how do I minimise my taxes, no matter what benefits I get from the countries in which I operate.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Stiglitz also said that <a href=\"http://press.labour.org.uk/post/129975218774/labour-announces-new-economic-advisory-committee\">Labour\u2019s economic advisory committee,</a> which he sits on, has been \u201cput into suspension\u201d until the leadership contest is over.

Because it\u2019s time to take a sober look at a presidency bookended by the spectacular mass murder on 11 September 2001, and the spectacular financial meltdown of 2008.</p> <p>From the rise of Isis to mass surveillance; from tax cuts for the wealthy to immigration reform; from the excesses of Wall Street to the struggles of Main Street; this election is taking place in a country that is still torn apart by the Bush years.</p> <p>Rahm Emanuel, Obama\u2019s hyperkinetic first chief of staff, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Revival-Struggle-Survival-Inside-Obama/dp/0307717429\">liked to say</a> that President Bush had left them a ribbon-wrapped gift of a shit sandwich: two wars, the worst recession in living memory and a disastrous international reputation.</p> <p>But Bush also left them a path out from his own colossal disasters: the massive government bailout of the financial sector, and a Federal Reserve prepared to take unprecedented measures to bankroll the global economy. A drone war to kill terrorist targets without boots on the ground, and a more stable Iraq that could allow for a US withdrawal.</p> <p>While Obama got to work on his special sandwich, Bush\u2019s Republican party is still stuck in the middle of it all. For the GOP can no more find its way out of the Bush debates than Britain\u2019s Labour party can decide how to deal with the legacy of Tony Blair.</p> <p>The single most contentious issue riling the Republican party is immigration: an issue that derailed Bush\u2019s presidency. After winning a second term, President Bush declared he enjoyed a considerable amount of political capital and would spend it on a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>He failed, mostly thanks to the vocal, nativist opposition of far-right talk radio hosts and their equivalent in the House of Representatives. It was the revival of those reform efforts that Donald Trump skewered so effectively in the GOP primaries, as he demolished his three biggest foes: Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and, yes, Bush\u2019s brother, Jeb.</p> <p>George W<strong> </strong>Bush \u2013 along with every other sane Republican \u2013 realized long ago that the Republican party had no future as a nativist rump, hostile to the fastest-growing demographic bloc of voters in the country.</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear whether Trump\u2019s new management team can move their candidate into this space. Despite their half-hearted spin, Trump left the indelible impression that he would deploy a deportation force against all undocumented immigrants, especially the \u201cmurderers and rapists\u201d he claimed Mexico was exporting to the US.</p> <p>The second most contentious issue of this election: how to treat Muslims and Arabs, and particularly Muslim Americans. In this area, Bush\u2019s approach was vastly more enlightened than Trump\u2019s, although it\u2019s fair to say that Genghis Khan also crossed this low bar.</p> <p>Bush visited a mosque in Washington less than a week after the 9/11 attacks to declare that \u201cIslam is peace\u201d and that Muslim Americans \u201cneed to be treated with respect\u201d. He added: \u201cWomen who cover their heads in this country must feel comfortable going outside their homes.\u201d (In those days it was hard to imagine a European country banning a burkini.)</p> <p>But you could also make the case that Bush stoked the politics of fear \u2013 especially in the 2002 and 2004 elections \u2013 that led directly to this point of peak Islamophobia. It was under Bush\u2019s watch, just one year after his second inauguration, that the fever took over. </p> <p>And it\u2019s outlasted the war on terror, although Trump is doing his best to revive both. His party refuses to disown him for trashing a Muslim American family who lost a son in Iraq, or for wanting to close US borders to a billion Muslims. It cannot or will not condemn him for proposing to torture detainees, in direct breach of international laws of war.<br></p> <p>Republicans cannot say where they stand on the Bush spectrum of the war on terror. Trump naturally hates it, pretending to have opposed the war in Iraq, as well as Bush\u2019s hostile turn against Russia. And the Republican foreign policy establishment hates Trump for all that and more.</p> <p>Before the Democrats feel too smug about the Bush conundrum, they should consider their own internal struggles. Much of the Clinton-Sanders battle was defined by the singular question of how to treat Wall Street: whether the bailout was justified and whether bank regulation went far enough. Many Sanders supporters remain opposed to Clinton because of her hawkish views on the Middle East.</p> <p>And for all their hatred of all things Bush, Democrats in Congress voted overwhelmingly with Republicans to stop President Obama from closing Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>After eight years of an economic turnaround, we have yet to resolve the debate about rescuing Wall Street. After eight years of troop withdrawals, we are considering sending troops back to Iraq and maintain what looks like a lot like a permanent force in Afghanistan.</p> <p>After eight years of Obama, we have not escaped the legacy of George W Bush. And no matter who wins, we are unlikely to do so any time soon.</p>",
  "<p>British and French interior ministers have ordered a fresh review of security in Calais and confirmed they will continue with the treaty under which British border checks are carried out on French soil.</p> <p>A joint statement issued by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, and her French counterpart, Bernard Cazeneuve, says they will work together to strengthen security around the \u201cshared border\u201d in Calais and \u201cstrongly diminish\u201d the migratory pressures that have attracted 7,000 migrants to the Channel tunnel port.</p> <p>The statement from the two ministers confirms their commitment to the 2003 Le Touquet treaty but makes no reference to calls from some French politicians for an asylum \u201chotspot\u201d processing centre to be set up in Calais to consider claims for asylum in Britain.</p> <p>French rightwing politicians, including Nicolas Sarkozy, have called for Le Touquet to be scrapped or changed, raising the prospect of the UK border returning from Calais to Dover.

He said: \u201cThis meeting between the home secretary and her counterpart has been in the diary for some time.

It is one of our closest allies.\u201d</p> <p>The spokesman said the French government continued to support the agreement with Britain as it stands, dismissing Bertrand\u2019s suggestions on both the treaty and the asylum centres.</p> <p>Former president Sarkozy, who hopes to make a comeback next year, has also said the \u201cJungle\u201d migrant camp should be shut down and moved to Britain, but the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said he wouldn\u2019t comment on a hypothetical situation that was a \u201clong way off\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/calais_locator-zip/giv-31075MSeZdE3QkZ5S\" data-alt=\"Calais migrant camp locator\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/calais_locator-zip/giv-31075MSeZdE3QkZ5S\">Calais migrant camp locator</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn terms of relationship with France it remains as strong as it ever has done, it remains absolutely critical.

  "<p>I have a long-held secret, but it is time to reveal it and give up on my dreams. Every set of birthday cake candles I blew out as a child, every wishbone snapped at a chicken roast dinner, I always wished for the same thing: that one day I would play in the NBA.</p> <p>The closest I came to realising this wish was meeting Steve Nash, the eight-time NBA all-star.

This event is likely to define an athlete\u2019s career, and the result will be internalised by that athlete for the rest of their life.</p> <p>When you head off to the Olympics the stakes are ridiculously high. The start line is a punishing and exquisite place. I love the buzz. I know everyone in the warm-up area deserves to be there. Each athlete has pushed themselves to excellence, hurting themselves over and over again in order to represent their country. That is an inspiration in itself.</p> <p>There is a brilliant intensity of emotion bubbling under the surface of the focused, concentrated and hard exterior of an athlete ready to perform. It is a raw experience that taps into the primal \u2013 the fight or flight response. The strange and potent combination of fear, rage and readiness that circulated throughout my body before the start buzzer in Rio is a feeling I will never forget. It is an addictive sensation: bold and blinding, beautiful and horrible in equal measure. If I could go again tomorrow I would, but it takes at least four years and a considerable chunk of your soul to earn that spot on the start line.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/britain-men-s-eight-row-olympic-gold-glory-women-silver\" title=\"\">race itself</a> flew by in a blur of perfection. I knew my crew were capable of big things but we had to do it on the day, when it really mattered. I share a common trait among the team: an obsessive eye for improvement. This unflinching commitment to ceaselessly perfect my rowing is compatible with the high-performance programme we follow. Every detail is torn apart and every performance analysed to yield the next speed gain.</p> <p>This perhaps explains the strangeness I felt after the Olympic final. There was very little I would change about how we executed that race. The smallest of details that I did pick up on did not matter. We had won the big one. The one that mattered. The one that I had strived for over so many years. In an instance that machine-like process had stopped. I no longer needed to analyse or to perfect. The end product had been reached. The regimented and planned timetable of training no longer existed. I was free.</p> <p>It is akin to line-dancing off a cliff. For nearly a decade coaches had mapped out every stage of my training. Every session was programmed, every day accounted for, and then abruptly the race was over, and it all stopped. It is disorienting: an alien sense of freedom, tinged with loss.</p> <p>On crossing the finish line the sensation was unexpected. I was aware of what had happened but I felt somehow detached. I knew everyone was celebrating and going crazy, but by contrast I was still. I don\u2019t understand why this was the case. It was as if my body were empty, or completely drained, and it felt as if I watched all this from outside of my body. I could hardly feel anything. On the landing stage I felt like a ghost. The effort was total, and I was exhausted. We had brought everything we had to those five minutes and 29 seconds of racing. I felt sick and disoriented. I think I was so overwhelmed by the experience I had no energy left to process what was happening. At some point someone sat me down and placed an ice pack on the back of my head/neck. The ice was bliss. It returned the world to focus. I knew this feeling, as surreal as it was, trumped the devastation of four years ago. In London 2012, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/01/london-2012-mens-eight-win-bronze\" title=\"\">we had led the Olympic final but were rowed down by two crews</a>, and the bronze medal felt a very bitter type of bittersweet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54a5139153474a8a6fa780efbbbfcd247bc7b27a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54a5139153474a8a6fa780efbbbfcd247bc7b27a/0_69_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Ransley top row, second from left: \u2018In some ways to be awarded the gold medal felt as surreal as if I found myself sitting beside Goldilocks eating porridge with the three bears.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Ransley top row, second from left: \u2018In some ways to be awarded the gold medal felt as surreal as if I found myself sitting beside Goldilocks eating porridge with the three bears.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This time, standing on the podium I pondered a truly surreal experience. It had all the trappings of an Olympic prize-giving. I was being awarded the Olympic gold medal. I could hardly take it all in. At one point in the proceedings a brief and casual thought popped into my head: this is all a construct, purpose-built for effect. The Olympic prize-giving is a piece of televised theatre. Despite an absolute belief that we could win, our plans and visualisations never extended beyond the finish line. In some ways being awarded the gold medal felt as surreal as if I found myself sitting beside Goldilocks eating porridge with the three bears.</p> <p>We dived headfirst into a whirlwind of parties. The city was alive with carnival-like celebrations. Unfortunately my energy levels waned with alarming speed. After a week I began to crave some normality. I ended the party-marathon the morning after the closing ceremony with several sleepless, singing Brits: there were four gold medallists across two different sports, shooting vodka from a paper cup at 7am in the Olympic food hall. This was not normal.</p> <p>By the time I boarded the flight home I felt as if I were nearing the end of an endurance event or some kind of sleep deprivation experiment. I was fast approaching breaking point where the next selfie, photo-op, or glass of champagne might be terminal. Apologies to the lovely BA staff who kindly served me a glass of champagne \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t face it. After no teammates accepted the offer I had to surreptitiously pour it down the sink at 30,000ft. For the first few hours of the flight I rapidly flitted in and out of strange dreams. I kept lurching back into consciousness, puncturing the snatched and restless sleep. In the end I opted for a Baileys. It did the trick. I was asleep in no time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/23/team-gb-return-rio-olympics-victorious-heathrow-champagn-honours\">Team GB return from Rio Olympics on gold-nosed 747</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The next thing I knew, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/23/team-gb-return-rio-olympics-victorious-heathrow-champagn-honours\" title=\"\">I stood bleary-eyed, in front of the world\u2019s media</a>.

I have spent most of the last 10 years preparing for major sports events, so the time following an Olympics can feel a bit empty: I felt a similar void after London. I like to have goals and targets to work towards and if I am not being productive then I can get frustrated, so losing the focus of winning the Olympics is a giant gap to fill. However, I enjoy visiting schools and other organisations to help inspire other people and share the positive values of sport.</p> <p>From within my chaotic and surreal memories of Rio grows a quiet satisfaction of a job well done; the pleasing knowledge that our crew executed the race in a manner we knew we were capable of, and that it was good enough to win the Olympic gold.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Australia\u2019s detention horror</strong><br></h2> <p>As an Australian, it pained me immeasurably to read the headline of the Guardian Weekly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\" title=\"\">(19 August)</a>: Australia\u2019s detention horror. As a committed global citizen, I had informed myself of the horrors of Australia\u2019s detention of those most vulnerable, of our government\u2019s rejection of humanitarian law and principles, and of the consistent denial by government ministers of the ongoing abuses perpetrated by the policies of our government.</p> <p>It is a tragedy for our nation and for those who continue to suffer.</p> <p>As an Australian, it brought me great pride to read the Weekly Review in the same edition, outlining the tireless work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/01/the-doctor-who-beat-big-tobacco\" title=\"\">Dr Bronwyn King</a>, who works against the tobacco giants to reduce the continuing havoc wreaked by the industry on vulnerable communities. It is an honour to call King one of our own.</p> <p>As an Australian, I was deeply moved by the archive piece of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/aug/19/archive-children-evacuated-to-australia-1940\" title=\"\">19 August 1940</a>, 480 children leave for Australia, and the description of the atmosphere the emigrants faced as \u201cvery kindly, with hopes for a good voyage, happy times and a glimpse into the future\u201d.</p> <p>Australians remain as yet removed from the realities of war and horrors abroad. We are also brave, courageous and intelligent, capable of taking on the giants who wage war against those most vulnerable. And some of us are those children, seeking a kinder world, with hopes of peaceful lives \u2013 that can be shared with those who seek safety and security and peace.</p> <p>The Australian people are not always represented by government policies. We will not be defeated. But we must continue to act for the sake of our common humanity.<br><strong>Christine Kerr</strong><br>Marrickville, NSW, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 Thank you for batting \u201cFair Australia\u201d right out of the ball park. Since 2001, the cruel trajectory of what was done to the Tampa refugees and others who followed in the so-called Pacific Solution has trashed Australia\u2019s reputation for decency and fairness. Outsourcing the care and protection of vulnerable men, women and children who legally crossed Australia\u2019s borders to claim protection, and outsourcing it to the mendicant, failing neighbouring states of Nauru and Papua New Guinea, was never going to comply with Australia\u2019s obligations under international law.</p> <p>Volunteers like me have supported refugees who set foot on Australian soil after years of suffering on Nauru, and accompanied them in their life in limbo on a temporary visa before family reunion and permanent settlement happened.</p> <p>Charities, community groups and individuals struggle to counter the debilitating despair among the \u201cboat people\u201d, and flail at the politicians and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media for perpetuating the untruths and myths about asylum seekers, who are not to be confused with illegal immigrants threatening our borders.</p> <p>A majority of Australians have a poor comprehension of refugee persecution. Nor do they understand refugee law \u2013 the human right to seek protection from persecution.<br><strong>Frederika E Steen </strong><br>Chapel Hill, Queensland, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 Regarding your cover story about the appalling level of abuse at the Nauru detention centre: a humane government would surely send an independent task force immediately. It would oversee the care of asylum seekers, and establish new processes and practices to ensure the abuse will cease until an internationally acceptable alternative to offshore detention is agreed. Bickering about setting up a ponderous inquiry is unacceptable. Asylum seekers can\u2019t&#xa0;wait.<br><strong>Hannah Morrow</strong><br>Cambridge, UK</p> <p>\u2022 Australia\u2019s offshore refugee gulags, with their potent appeal to xenophobic populism, but minus the public backlash, are exactly what the politicians intended.</p> <p>Despite their reverence for fiscal rectitude, our leaders are untroubled by the huge cost of imprisoning fewer than 1,800 innocent detainees. They also seem determined to defy the UN Refugee Convention. In this they are blessed by Australia\u2019s luck in being a democracy unfettered by either a bill or charter of rights. In the right\u2019s hands, this is priceless.<br><strong>John Hayward</strong><br>Weegena, Tasmania, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 Are Indigenous Australians wishing they had been able to take all arrivals from Britain and expel them to Nauru? After all, the British settlers, whether convicts or free men, decided to take over all the fertile land. They did not seek acceptance by the aboriginal population, who were victimised either at the point of a gun, by the poisoning of water wells or the diseases to which they had no resistance.<br><strong>Marika Sherwood</strong><br>London, UK</p> <h2><strong>Terror and social media</strong><br></h2> <p>In his piece French media\u2019s blackout on terrorists\u2019 photos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/french-media-terrorists-identities-le-monde-social\" title=\"\">(5 August)</a>, Jason Burke makes a valid observation on the decline in importance of the print media in the context of the terrorists\u2019 interests in glorifying so-called martyrs through violence. The desire for publicity ranks very high in these strategies, and however well-intentioned the decision of Le Monde and other leading French newspapers not to publish photos of those who carry out terrorist attacks may be, the attackers have a much bigger reach through social media than through print.</p> <p>The issue, as Burke sees it, is that those with an interest in these new martyrs do not look for them in the well-established print media, but have ready access to so much social media that the martyrs have also gained considerable promotion through the print media itself.</p> <p>What is needed is a deep study on how democracy in practice, in keeping with its values, can keep a watchful eye on the influence of social media through the \u201cextraordinary freedom and power of the digital revolution\u201d.</p> <p>Burke\u2019s analysis of the situation is a reminder of the reality of the media today, and what needs to be done. It certainly is a tough call.<br><strong>Lucien Rajakarunanayake</strong><br>Dehiwela, Sri Lanka</p> <h2><strong>Reading builds empathy</strong><br></h2> <p>Florence Rosier\u2019s article How reading helps us empathise with others (19 August) offers proof of the belief since ancient times that books about other people, either in scroll form or bound between covers, are \u201cmedicine for the soul\u201d. She describes how 21st-century \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance\u201d shows that certain areas of our brain \u201clight up\u201d and \u201coverlap\u201d when we are reading fiction, \u201cactivating\u201d our apparently inherent ability to understand other people.</p> <p>This further reinforces the advice offered to parents of autistic children and those with Asperger\u2019s syndrome that reading stories can help them acquire the social skills to empathise with other people\u2019s thoughts, beliefs, desires and&#xa0;intentions.<br><strong>Richard Orlando</strong><br>Westmount, Quebec, Canada</p> <h2><strong>Wrong about New Zealand</strong><br></h2> <p>In purporting to provide another side to the New Zealand immigration fantasy, Eleanor Ainge Roy fails <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/05/trump-brexit-is-new-zealand-your-escape-route-too\" title=\"\">(8 August)</a>. Sadly, she has discouraged no one. Her self-congratulatory tone shines through, and echoes that of the new middle-class New Zealanders who have cast aside their egalitarian roots as they look smugly out over their sea and mountain views, endlessly repeating how beautiful they are. Meanwhile, the swelling ranks of have-not New Zealanders drown in the misery of no longer being able to afford to buy&#xa0;a house.</p> <p>Her \u201cstrongly held belief\u201d that New Zealand is underpopulated misses the point of its empty spaces. She reminds me of the sad fellow who created an app listing all the free camping spots, thereby fast-tracking their demise.</p> <p>If her experience leads to exciting insights, by all means she should share them, but tell her to please stop talking about New Zealand.<br><strong>Trevor Dagg</strong><br>Christchurch, New Zealand</p> <h2><strong>Briefly</strong><br></h2> <p>\u2022 Recent issues have contained terms somewhat mystifying to North Americans: \u201cfacer\u201d, meaning a sudden difficulty, and \u201cpunt\u201d, a speculation.

Or perhaps the angst of&#xa0;being wheeled on a stretcher by paramedics into the hospital emergency department? No \u2013 the mental state of being drunk out of one\u2019s mind.

  "<p>\u201cIn space no one can hear you scream.\u201d It\u2019s the chilling tagline to Ridley Scott\u2019s classic sci-fi horror, Alien. Last Friday, as I and 30 others read aloud for 10 hours from more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/nauru-files\" title=\"\">2,000 leaked incident reports of the Nauru files</a> published by Guardian Australia earlier this month, the line came back to me.

Our own humanity seems a fair enough price to pay.</p> <p>I say our, because Europe more broadly and the UK in particular subscribes to such merciless thinking. The tabled deal between the EU and Turkey, to return asylum seekers to the latter, is a clear example, so much so that <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/06/eus-reckless-refugee-returns-to-turkey-illegal/\" title=\"\">Amnesty International calls it</a> \u201cunconscionable\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d.

Last week the Express <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/703707/refugee-crisis-North-Africa-Italy-migration\" title=\"\">reported</a> that this year there has been a 37% increase in the numbers of migrants missing or dying at sea.</p> <p>In the UK, Calais is all but in name an offshore detention centre like Nauru. Earlier this month the campaign group <a href=\"http://www.citizensuk.org/new_figures_on_child_refugees_in_calais\" title=\"\">Citizens UK revealed</a> it had identified 170 unaccompanied child asylum seekers all of whom had a legal right to be reunited with their families in the UK while having their claim processed.

Better to avoid drops in share prices than discover if detained women have suffered sexual violence.</p> <p>With the Nauru files, we are in danger of detaching ourselves from the horrors they document.

This clarity can only be achieved by excluding a privileged trade agreement with the UK ... The century-old British strategy remains the same, ie to weaken the forces that can make Europe stronger. The UK can achieve this by insisting on a special deal whereby the UK maintains the benefits of the union while not sharing in the costs. Such a deal would signal to other member countries that by exiting, they can continue to enjoy the benefits of the union without the costs. Such a prospect would fatally weaken the European Union.</p> </blockquote> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/brexit/2016/08/top-10-reasons-brexit-isnt-working-according-brexiteers\">New Statesman, Ian Leslie has a light-hearted but actually fairly accurate sounding guide to the top 10 reasons why Brexit isn\u2019t working \u2013 according, of course, to Brexiters</a> (sabotage by Whitehall, remainers talking down the country, untrustworthy experts, EU bureaucrats, etc etc):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the next few years, it is likely that the economy will shrink, the entire government will be consumed by trade negotiations, and EU leaders will use their considerable negotiation advantages to theatrically screw us. As this unpretty story unfolds, those who argued confidently for Brexit, in parliament and in the press, will feel compelled to maintain that they were right, and that if it hadn\u2019t been for some other impossible-to-foresee factor everything would be going splendidly. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Tweet of the week</h2> <p>The obvious silver lining?

After the UK voted for Brexit in June, the Socialist government said there would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/25/french-border-deal-wont-be-affected-by-brexit-paris\">no renegotiation</a> of the British-French immigration deal because it would not be in French interests. </p> <p>Cazeneuve warned that a change to the deal would send a signal to traffickers and smugglers that they could legitimately leave people at the French border to cross to England and would lead to tens of thousands more migrants in northern France. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said there would be \u201cno sense\u201d in changing the deal.</p> <p>The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, declined to comment directly on the fate of the Le Touquet agreement when asked after a campaign event in London, instead saying the burden of taking refugees should be better spread across the EU.</p> <p>\u201cThe point I always make about the refugee crisis across Europe is it has to be shared across the whole of the European union,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment Germany takes by far the largest proportion of Syrian asylum seekers and others. Some countries take none, and some take a very small number. The whole of Europe must recognise that we do have a moral duty to take a far greater number of asylum seekers all across Europe.\u201d</p> <p>He said the UK should particularly be more ready to process asylum claims for people with family links to the country, adding: \u201cWhere there are family connections of people in the camps with family in Britain then clearly they can apply, and often do.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn condemned conditions in the main Calais camp, and similar ones along the coast in Dunkirk, both of which he has visited. \u201cI\u2019ve seldom seen anything so disgusting as those fetid camps in a land of plenty. It\u2019s not necessary,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Sir Peter Ricketts, a former British ambassador to France, warned on Monday that if a rightwing candidate won the presidential election next year, Britain \u201cis going to have to deal with a pretty serious conversation with France about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/25/french-border-deal-wont-be-affected-by-brexit-paris\">the Le Touquet agreement</a>\u201d.</p> <p>He said the UK was unlikely to accept the hotspot idea \u2013 adopted by the EU to tackle the crisis of mass migration from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to Greece and Italy \u2013 warning that it would attract many more people to Calais. \u201cAs soon as you suggest that, it becomes a huge magnet,\u201d added Ricketts.</p>",
  "<h2><em>\u2018It\u2019s clearly doing something right\u2019 </em><em>- </em>Canary Wharf Jazz Festival</h2> <p>The Canary Wharf Jazz Festival is a free two day jazz music event held each August in Canada Square Park in London\u2019s Docklands. The performers, many of whom have received music industry awards, are all UK based. The festival feels local with the audience travelling in each day. I went with my partner and 14-year-old daughter. Julia Biel was the performer we enjoyed seeing most this year. </p> <p>The environment is very family friendly. The organisers even hand out picnic mats to people who haven\u2019t brought their own. One year when it started to rain, they offered everyone plastic ponchos. This year was the Canary Wharf Jazz Festival\u2019s tenth anniversary and it was very well attended, so it\u2019s clearly doing something right. I\u2019ll certainly be back next year. <em><strong>Alex Flynn</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84d7d0f81c14a0ea05abb26d45beab850878b2f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84d7d0f81c14a0ea05abb26d45beab850878b2f6/0_0_1200_756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supremely talented jazz vocalist Julia Biel and band smile and play on as strong winds force open the back curtains and blow across the stage at the Canary Wharf Jazz Festival, London 20 August 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"630\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supremely talented jazz vocalist Julia Biel and band smile and play on as strong winds force open the back curtains and blow across the stage at the Canary Wharf Jazz Festival, London 20 August 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AlexFlynn/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em>\u2018The festival has stolen my heart\u2019 - </em>Sunflowerfest 2016, Northern Ireland<br></h2> <p>I lived in London for 25 years but moved to Northern Ireland five years ago. I\u2019ve been going to Sunflowerfest every summer since. The festival is very well organised with different sections for family camping, singles camping, rowdy camping, showers utilising compost for energy and various activities for kids.</p> <p>The festival focuses mainly on local musicians, but a few fairly big name bands always headline the event. There\u2019s always a great atmosphere, with the bands enjoying themselves around the festival when they\u2019re not performing. My favourite performers were the band The Twisted Sisters - an irreverent bunch who sing songs about Guinness, potatoes and big knickers! Apart from the headliners they attract the biggest crowd. I also really enjoy a singer called Amanda St John who has a big band soul and jazz sound. The harpist Ursula Burns was great too. I used to go to the festivals in England such as Reading every summer. I loved them but Sunflowerfest, although being a lot smaller and a completely different kettle of fish, has stolen my heart and will always be my favourite festival experience. <strong><em>Debbie Deboo</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"caff5ce0c85a29f5e1f54259790756d7a7247da3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caff5ce0c85a29f5e1f54259790756d7a7247da3/0_0_1182_1042/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunflowerfest 2016 - \u2018it will always be my favourite summer festival experience\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"882\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunflowerfest 2016 - \u2018it will always be my favourite summer festival experience\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Debbie Deboo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em>\u2018The whole crew is like a giant family\u2019 -</em> Eisteddfod, Wales</h2> <p>I\u2019m from a village just a few miles away from Llangollen in north-east Wales, where the Eisteddfod festival is held every year. I haven\u2019t missed a festival since I was born, so I\u2019ve been to 20 of them. 21 If you count when Mum was five months pregnant with me. </p> <p>I was working there this year. I\u2019m part of the sound crew on the main stage, which I\u2019ve continued to do every year since I did it for Year 10 work experience. The festival is generally well organised, although it had a few hiccups as with any event of its scale. People come for the wide variety of competitions during the daytime. Others come for the evening concerts that are the main attractions. This year the biggest names were Collabro, Bryn Terfel and Jools Holland. Others just come onto the field for the stalls, performances on the outside stages or the general buzz of all the international competitors. </p> <p>The best experience is definitely working with the rest of the sound and backstage crew during the week, and doing so on such a unique festival just a few miles from my home in a gorgeous setting. The whole crew is like a giant family. In addition meeting people from so many different countries and creating friendships over the week is brilliant. I\u2019ll be doing it again without a doubt! <strong><em>Eluned Ashwood</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"870d98a66904507e5be8846dd7acea01232a134e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/870d98a66904507e5be8846dd7acea01232a134e/0_0_640_640/500.jpg\" alt=\"Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eluned Ashwood/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em>\u2018It\u2019s a perfect way to discover more of my country\u2019s diverse culture\u2019 - </em>Sinulog, Philippines</h2> <p>I\u2019m originally from Cebu, Philippines. Sinulog is a yearly event in the city, where dancers from the different provinces in the Philippines perform. That\u2019s the main attraction. Every contingent of dancers will have their different custom themes and usually surprise and stun the audience in equal measure with their performances. This year I went with a colleague. There\u2019s always a plethora of people there, more or less three million, and I wish more would be done about crowd control. </p> <p>Sinulog is a cultural fiesta and is a perfect way for me and others to witness and discover more of my country\u2019s diverse culture. I\u2019m a history buff and anything that is cultural for me is great. It\u2019s a busy street parade and you have to do a lot of walking. Commuting is very hard at that time. Each year more and more contingents are joining, not only in the Visayas region but also in Mindanao \u2013 a region that\u2019s very rich in culture and where tribal traditions are still evident. I\u2019ll definitely go again. <strong><em>Jennin Bartolata</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5deae46a6722bfc22fea15da4812d3d6e86312bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5deae46a6722bfc22fea15da4812d3d6e86312bb/0_0_1856_1233/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dancers at Sinulog - an annual cultural and religious festival held in Cebu, Philippines\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dancers at Sinulog - an annual cultural and religious festival held in Cebu, Philippines</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jennin Bartolata</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018</strong><em>You do need to enjoy a party</em><strong><em>\u2019 - </em>The Berlin Carnival</strong><br></h2> <p>This was my first time in Berlin, but I joined my sister who has been many times. A group of 18 of us travelled. We met more Londoners once we were there. The festival was very well organised. It all started with a J\u2019Ouvert party, where festival goers cover each other in paint and power. This was swiftly followed by a fire fete, boat party, roof top party, beach party, glow party, the actual carnival day and a closing party. There was no trouble, no problems, and plenty of rum. You do need to enjoy a party though! <br></p> <p>Ricardo Drue, Patrice Roberts and Lyrical were headlining the event, but I think most people were really looking forward to the selection of DJs who had flown in from around the world. These included Private Ryan from Trinidad and Tobago, American DJ Stephen and DJ Tate and Triple M from the UK. Flying home on a Tuesday with a hangover was tough but worth it. <strong><em>Katrina Frazer</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"add770f5fb186f355e2c23566969bfc56e62d558\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/add770f5fb186f355e2c23566969bfc56e62d558/0_0_1200_778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Berlin Carnival Beach Party 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Berlin Carnival Beach Party 2016</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katrina Frazer/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em>\u2018It\u2019s a a wonderful piece of popular Andalusian culture\u2019 -</em> Sherry Festival, Spain</h2> <p>This summer I was at the<strong> </strong>Sherry Festival in the Spanish town of Sanlucar.

The festival was very well organised with a cabaret and music tent, various sherry producers with outlets and a fairground.

Thousands of Brits head to the sleepy island of Pag in Croatia every summer to see the best DJs on the planet. As the focus is on dance music, it felt like lots of people had come to enjoy the vibe and the parties, rather than to see one specific act. Then again, Craig David was a highlight for me and plenty of others! </p> <p>The festival was really well organised. The combination of the beach and guaranteed sunshine made for a great experience. I thought it was a shame it was nearly all Brits attending. I\u2019d hoped it might feel a little more international. Rather than going to this one again, I\u2019d prefer to check out some other festivals around Croatia in the future. There are plenty of new ones to discover every year.</p> <p>My favourite ever summer festival experience was seeing Stevie Wonder at British Summer Time in Hyde Park a few years ago. I remember the sun was just setting as he played \u201cYou Are The Sunshine Of My Life\u201d.

With such a variety of music on offer it attracted different crowds, and I was able to enjoy each night as a kind of stand alone mini festival. <br></p> <p>Sigur Ros were incredible. The arching shape of the venue amphitheatre just seemed to lock the sound in with us, under the stars, by the waters edge. And the photo I took of Catfish and the Bottlemen was how the music felt to me. They really did get great feedback from the crowd. The venue space was limited, but it was really well organised.

Everything ran like clockwork and you could guarantee everything would be on time.<br></p> <p>As a keen photographer it was the opportunity to photograph big name acts that appealed to me.

The hot weather was great. You could spend most of the day at the beach before the music started.

I grew up speaking French, Arabic and sometimes Berber. My childhood was filled with summers by the beach, simple pleasures like eating fresh watermelon on the sand, Friday visits to the market with my father and the weekly traditional couscous with a glass of leben, a dairy beverage. But the innocence of my childhood was soon disrupted by a civil war. </p> <p>Algeria experienced an \u201cArab Fall\u201d in 1988, which led to a war between armed Islamic groups and the Algerian army and state. Many journalists, intellectuals, artists were among about 200,000 Algerians who died under the blades and bullets of these fanatic murderers. Almost overnight, the face of Algerian society changed and entered one of the darkest times of its history.</p> <p>During the paroxysm of the war in the mid-90s, my parents decided that it was safer to temporarily move to France, as my mother had received death threats. It was a return \u201chome\u201d for her as she was born and raised in France by immigrant Algerian parents. <br></p> <p>I remember feeling grateful that I could finally walk down the street without being scared. But yet, I often felt out of place. I encountered racism for the first time and discovered what it was to be an outsider. I was surprised to discover that Algerians were not exactly well received and welcome. I did not know then, considering my age, the complicated intricacies inherited from colonial times. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/23/american-dream-trailer-park-i-couldnt-be-happier\">My American dream led to a trailer park.

I became aware of the multiple subcultures of this gigantic country that is the United States and I remember being amazed by how people considered America their home while also remaining proud of their ethnic or cultural background. <br></p> <p>That didn\u2019t negate the persisting racism and the presence of the dark cloud of slavery floating over America. Yet, those years ended up being among the most enriching of my life. I slowly fell in love with this heterogeneous society.

America also allowed me to appreciate and embrace my \u201cFrenchness\u201d \u2013 up until then, I did not really know how French I was.

But there is greater doubt over whether such a drama could \u2013 or should \u2013 be written today.

A clue that Osborne\u2019s approach is metaphorical rather than journalistic is Archie being, unusually for his profession, a former public schoolboy. (Max Miller, one of the models for him, had left state school at the age of 12.)</p> <p>As the Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro has shown, Hamlet and King Lear can be seen as state-of-the-nation plays, finding in far Denmark and ancient England subtle parallels for fears about invasion and the lottery of Royal succession that were convulsing the playwright\u2019s country as he wrote.</p> <p>However, the genre peaked in the decade or so after The Entertainer. Alan Bennett\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/sep/28/forty-years-on-review\" title=\"\">Forty Years On</a> (1968), a satirical examination of changing postwar Britain, was set in a public school nudgingly called Albion.

But because Hare depicts a marginalisation of Anglicanism that has continued, the play has retained its relevance in revivals, further helped by the fact that the depicted religious tension between orthodoxy and reform apply just as strongly to political parties, the health system and broadcasting.</p> <p>Some of the laments in The Entertainer \u2013 immigration, the venality&nbsp;of the Tories but ineffectuality of Labour, different rules for the poor and rich, and the idiocy of popular culture \u2013 also prove surprisingly enduring, suggesting that national dissatisfactions tend to take the same conservative-nostalgic form.</p> <p>No modern playwright, though, could&nbsp;make an end-of-pier auditorium \u2013 and still less an NHS hospital or a school \u2013 a metaphor for wider Britain because the funding systems and policies across the UK are now so varied.</p> <p>So, while The Entertainer may continue to be revived, especially around anniversaries of the Suez crisis, the library shelf to which it belongs now feels as rickety as the stages Archie Rice played. Any theatre hoping to sum up a country now would surely be drawn to the portmanteau form: a season of plays written by several authors variegated by gender, race, faith and (at the more far-thinking venues) even politics.

The 45th parliament was opened by the governor general, Peter Cosgrove.

It was a policy list from the last election.<br></strong></li> <li><strong>Labor has confirmed it will introduce a marriage equality bill, which may come to parliament in the next few days or may not \u2013 depending on strategic reasons.<br></strong></li> <li><strong>The omnibus bill was the subject of chest-beating by both sides. Labor has yet to give a final decision on whether to support the $6.1bn in savings as it was only handed over in the last 24 hours and it is 650 pages. <br></strong></li> <li><strong>Labor has asked Turnbull to join with them and reaffirm the parliament\u2019s commitment to non-discrimination in immigration and Indigenous affairs. With an eye to Cory Bernardi\u2019s push to change 18c of the Racial Discrimination Act and Pauline Hanson\u2019s policies on Islam, Labor is trying to draw Turnbull out on equality. John Howard and Kim Beazley agreed on this motion in 1996. <br></strong></li> <li><strong>As to the Cory motion, Bernardi has given notice of it but it probably won\u2019t come up for debate until next year.

The bush mail inside the Coalition informs me <strong>he\u2019s signed up every backbencher in the upper house in the Liberal and National parties with the exception of Jane Hume, a new Liberal from Victoria</strong>. The bill now could have support from as many as 20 senators, if we throw in the crossbench. That\u2019s obviously a sizeable minority of senators, a minority that will be pretty hard for the prime minister to ignore, which is presumably why <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> has recently switched his line from no, we are not overhauling the RDA, to we are not overhauling the RDA \u201cyet.\u201d Bernardi won\u2019t confirm he has 20 but he\u2019s told me he\u2019s \u201cheartened by the level of support I\u2019ve received\u201d.</p> <p>Back to you Gabrielle Chan.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T23:49:07.251Z\">at 12.49am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c4c4b4e4b0655f72768985\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T23:27:59.850Z\">12.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Bill Shorten</strong> thanked <strong>Tina Brown</strong> and the <strong>Wedgetails</strong> for the welcome to country.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Australians most certainly want this 45th parliament to be capable of rising above self-seeking, narrow sectional interests.

That\u2019s what we are paid for, we are paid to make decisions and this is a decision that can and should be made by the parliament.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T23:25:37.079Z\">at 12.25am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c4bbf9e4b0655f7276897a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T22:51:35.812Z\">11.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Orders of the day</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <ul> <li>9.00 am<br></li> <li> Welcome to country ceremony <br></li> <li><em>(Members to assemble in the Great Hall at 8.45 am)</em><br></li> <li>10.30 am<br></li> <li>Announcement of proclamation calling the parliament together<br></li> <li>Procession to Senate chamber for opening of the parliament<br></li> <li>Return to House for swearing in of members<br></li> <li>Election of Speaker<br></li> <li> 12.15 pm<em> </em><br></li> <li>House suspends<br></li> <li>2.40 pm<br></li> <li>House resumes<br></li> <li>Presentation of Speaker to the governor-general in members\u2019 hall<br></li> <li>Return to House<br></li> <li>3.05 pm<br></li> <li>Procession to Senate chamber for governor-general\u2019s speech and return to House at conclusion<br></li> <li>Formal business<br></li> <li>Ministerial and party leadership arrangements<br></li> <li>Presentation of formal bill<br></li> <li>Governor-general\u2019s speech reported and formation of address-in-reply committee<br></li> <li>4.00 pm<br></li> <li>House suspends<br></li> <li>5.00 pm<br></li> <li>House resumes<br></li> <li>Election of deputy Speaker and second deputy Speaker<br></li> <li>Government and other business<br></li> <li>Adjournment (no debate)</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T23:32:21.018Z\">at 12.32am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c4b93ee4b0396caaf9a013\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T22:45:06.496Z\">11.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are so many moving parts in this day and most of them will happen inside the parliament.

It has been reported that ICAC will not make findings against Senator Sinodinos.</p> <p>A separate audit by the NSW Electoral Commission however has already found that the Liberals had \u201cchannelled\u201d and \u201cdisguised\u201d prohibited donations, including $690,000 through a federally registered body called the Free Enterprise Foundation. Donors included Westfield and Walker Corporation. </p> </blockquote> <p>Sinodinos, now Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s cabinet secretary and very trusted adviser, has repeatedly denied any knowledge of funds. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/03/arthur-sinodinos-tells-the-icac-he-cant-recall-donations-to-liberal-party\">His most frequent answers in the hearing were \u201cI can\u2019t recall\u201d</a>. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T23:33:02.731Z\">at 12.33am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c4b692e4b0655f72768975\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T22:31:07.744Z\">11.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Bill Shorten</strong> has just been bailed up by a man outside the church service complaining about his language regarding those opposing marriage equality.</p> <p>As the church bells chimed over the top of them, Shorten replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People of faith can be opposed to marriage equality, says Shorten.</p> <p>It\u2019s not about faith, it\u2019s just a point of view ...</p> <p>Yes sorry, if you\u2019ve got more to say I will listen to you, says Shorten.</p> <p>Thank you.</p> <p>People of faith can be opposed to marriage equality but some people who object to marriage equality do have homophobic attitudes, says Shorten.</p> <p>Of course.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T23:33:21.605Z\">at 12.33am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c4b63fe4b09fcabd06d1d2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T22:25:52.374Z\">11.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Lord give me strength.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38adbdc73d026652ca19d3d622cf75492cafe234\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38adbdc73d026652ca19d3d622cf75492cafe234/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Turnbull finds a moment of reflection.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malcolm Turnbull finds a moment of reflection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The brilliant Mr Bowers.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c4b557e4b09fcabd06d1d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T22:23:44.867Z\">11.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The choirboys, run to paradise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec1dbd5dcee9454cd4acdb0998ab5c22fd6307a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec1dbd5dcee9454cd4acdb0998ab5c22fd6307a7/0_178_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The attorney general, George Brandis, and Kevin Andrews\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The attorney general, George Brandis, and Kevin Andrews.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T23:33:46.420Z\">at 12.33am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c4b429e4b0655f72768974\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T22:18:32.025Z\">11.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Church cabinet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9f9a719badc868625ef92a27b8491655988ecf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9f9a719badc868625ef92a27b8491655988ecf6/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop consider the metaphysical ahead of parliament.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop consider the metaphysical ahead of parliament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c4b2bae4b0396caaf9a00d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T22:10:38.742Z\">11.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I love #politicslive readers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ComissionerKate/status/770362175890206720\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">PL returns today!

Those watching yesterday will know that <strong>Nick Xenophon</strong> said he would block the plebiscite legislation because it was just an expensive opinion poll. </p> <p>Labor opposes the plebiscite but has yet failed to say categorically whether it will vote against the legislation.</p> <p><strong>George Brandis</strong> was on Lateline last night and warned Labor to get outta the way. Brandis is a supporter of marriage equality.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s instructive that after the shadow cabinet meeting this morning, the Labor party, although critical of the plebiscite process, in fact stopped short of saying that it would vote against the plebiscite legislation, which the government is determined to proceed with. I very much hope that the Labor party gets out of the way on this and <strong>Bill Shorten</strong> doesn\u2019t succumb to the temptation to play politics with the issue because, I can tell you that <strong>people in the gay community in particular with whom I have been speaking are sick to death of being treated as pawns in some kind of political game. </strong></p> </blockquote> <p>This last point is very true. Except both sides have a history of playing games on this. Remember the plebiscite itself was originally introduced by <strong>Tony Abbott</strong> as a delaying tactic. Until it won over some for entirely different reasons \u2013 such as making a grand public statement or providing cover for conservatives to vote yes. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T23:35:43.361Z\">at 12.35am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c4ad45e4b0396caaf9a008\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T21:57:25.867Z\">10.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Newspoll: 50-50 but Malcolm Turnbull's net satisfaction drops below Bill Shorten</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/newspoll/newspoll-malcolm-turnbull-in-plunge-to-new-low/news-story/69066af7603eeaad7442a7383bd34fa8\">Here is Phil Hudson on the key points</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Newspoll, taken over the weekend exclusively for Th \u00adAustralian, reveals <strong>satisfaction with the prime minister\u2019s performance has fallen to 34%, his lowest level since he toppled Tony Abbott</strong> almost a year ago and down six points since the last measure on the eve of the July 2 election.

Ring the bells! Here we are back in the 45th parliament. We have lost some friends and gained some new ones. There are 39 newbies turning up for their first day. We have a politically and religiously ecumenical service to start attended by <strong>Malcolm Turnbull, Bill Shorten </strong>and<strong> Barnaby Joyce</strong>, followed by the swearing in. </p> <p>The governor general Sir <strong>Peter Cosgrove</strong> will make a speech, Speaker <strong>Tony Smith</strong> will be ceremonially dragged to his chair and then the formal business will be underway.</p> <p>The real business, of course, is already well underway. Yesterday was dominated by two very long party room meetings. The Coalition and Labor have pretty well got all their committee positions sorted and already, outliers are organising their various sorties to cut across the more organised agendas. Think 18c, think marriage equality. </p> <p>The Coalition\u2019s business is the budget omnibus bill, now fully briefed out to the Coalition backbenchers, Labor and some senators. This was the bill that raps all the government\u2019s budget savings into one, including the measures that Labor included in its pre-election savings. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/29/conservatives-flex-muscle-over-marriage-equality-and-18c\">Murpharoo has fleshed it out here.</a></p> <p>Post-election, Labor has resisted agreeing to the bill until they saw the fine print. Labor\u2019s manager of opposition business, <strong>Tony Burke</strong>, this morning has said, well lucky we did! One more measure has been added and the final savings total has changed.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government has lied about the contents of this bill ... the bill that has now emerged is different to what the government has said it would be.</p> </blockquote> <p>I shall have the Newspoll results for you in a moment. Shorter version \u2013 parties remain neck and neck, Turnbull\u2019s support continues to drop. </p> <p>So let\u2019s get on with it. The most exciting news for me is <strong>Mike Bowers</strong> is back in town. He is chasing the pollies at a nearby church and will follow them throughout the day. Talk to us in the thread below or on the Twits @gabriellechan and @mpbowers.</p> <p>Strap yourself in people.

  "<p>The home secretary, Amber Rudd, is expected to tell her French counterpart on Tuesday that Britain is determined to retain the Le Touquet agreement that allows border checks to take place in Calais, despite growing controversy in France.</p> <p>Rudd is expected to travel to Paris to meet Bernard Cazeneuve face-to-face for the first time. The pair had been due to discuss cooperation on terrorism and security following a series of deadly attacks in France, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bastille-day-truck-attack\">including in Nice</a>. <br></p> <p>But she is also expected to warn the French interior minister that proposals mooted by the regional president for hotspots to be set up, where migrants could apply for asylum in Britain directly from the Calais camps, are unacceptable to the UK government.</p> <p>A Home Office source said: \u201cThis is a complete non-starter. The home secretary is crystal clear that people in need of protection should seek asylum in the first safe country they enter. That\u2019s the long-held norm, and we are going to stick to it.\u201d<br></p> <p>The president of the region around Calais, Xavier Bertrand, called on Monday for the Le Touquet agreement to end, telling the BBC: \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to keep people here without a new agreement between the two governments.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9849151e38c198bff6c1ba6f07eccda13a3e6331\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9849151e38c198bff6c1ba6f07eccda13a3e6331/0_50_4128_2478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Xavier Bertrand at the Jungle camp in Calais in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Xavier Bertrand at the Jungle camp in Calais in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Huguen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/nicolas-sarkozy-declares-candidacy-french-presidential-election\">contender in next year\u2019s election</a>, also used a speech at the weekend to call for the so-called Jungle refugee camp in Calais to be relocated to the UK. </p> <p>The Le Touquet agreement is a reciprocal arrangement that allows British border officials to check the documents of migrants seeking to enter Britain from the camps in Calais \u2013 and French officials to do the same in Dover.</p> <p>But some French politicians claim it supports the existence of the Calais camp, in which thousands of refugees live in squalid conditions. </p> <p>Sarkozy said: \u201cI\u2019m demanding the opening of a centre in Britain to deal with asylum seekers in Britain, so that Britain can do the work that concerns them.

  "<h2>Jackson\u2019s Cabin, East Sussex</h2> <p>What was once a honey farm is now a honeypot for in the far east of the South Downs. The large one-bedroom cabin has smart modern interiors but plenty of rustic character (there\u2019s a wood-burning stove, a partially timber-clad bathroom and original artwork on the walls; the owner is an artist and also runs painting holidays).

The setting is pretty cosseting, too: just outside Edale, at the start of the Pennine Way. Each tent has views of Grindslow Knoll, a hill linked to Kinder Scout \u2013 encouragement to set out on one of myriad local walks. The Chestnut Centre, with its owls, otters and deer, is 15 minutes\u2019 drive away, and the Gathering arranges family-friendly activities in school holidays, from nature walks to arts and crafts and egg collecting.

  "<p>The village headman, or <em>muhtar</em>, is the plankton in the food chain of Turkish politics. He \u2013 or, less often, she \u2013 is an elected local official who counts heads, settles feuds, and finds cats.</p> <p>On the night of 15 July, Can Cumurcu, the <em>muhtar</em> of the affluent neighbourhood of \u00c7engelk\u00f6y, on the Asian shore of Istanbul, led the defence of his manor against soldiers who had joined a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/military-coup-was-well-planned-and-very-nearly-succeeded-say-turkish-officials\">military coup</a> to topple President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. \u00c7engelk\u00f6y was the scene of a thrilling people\u2019s defence against the rebels. Cumurcu was shot just above the hip; now he\u2019s reckoned a <em>gazi</em>, or holy warrior.</p> <p>When I met him a couple of weeks after the coup failed, Cumurcu was propped up on the sofa in his flat in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y. His amiable face darkened when he mentioned his dead nephew, who had been cut down by army bullets during the coup \u2013 but the resolve in his voice, and his references to the \u201cesteemed\u201d president, the \u201csacred\u201d national flag, and God, made it clear that he felt that he had done his duty as a Turk and a Muslim.</p> <p>\u201cI got home at around 10pm that night,\u201d he remembered, wincing from his sore side, \u201cand my neighbours told me there were tanks on the Bosphorus Bridge.\u201d Cumurcu went down to the coastal road, where people were discussing the announcement on TV that the army had taken over the country. Then he saw an army captain entering \u00c7engelk\u00f6y on foot, firing his gun into the air.</p> <p>\u201cThe captain saw me and said, \u2018get these people inside!\u2019 I said sharply, \u2018Have you been drinking? Are you all right in the head?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The captain retreated but Cumurcu guessed he would come back with reinforcements to clear the road. The <em>muhtar</em> arranged for a barricade of vehicles to be formed, and more locals were roused using social media. Some were armed; so were the handful of pro-Erdo\u011fan duty officers at \u00c7engelk\u00f6y\u2019s small police station. Shortly after midnight, the soldiers stormed back into the neighbourhood with a burst of automatic fire. Cumurcu was flung into the air by a slug that passed through his side.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/sep/16/welcome-to-demokrasi-how-erdogan-got-more-popular-than-ever-podcast\">Welcome to demokrasi: how Erdo\u011fan got more popular than ever \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The stricken <em>muhtar</em> was rushed to a nearby hospital \u2013 which would receive 60 dead and wounded over the course of the night. Back in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y, the putschists had seized the police station but were unable to advance further. They took hostages and forced them to their knees in the road. According to media reports, one officer shouted, \u201cYou dogs! Don\u2019t you know there\u2019s only one God? Your God is Erdo\u011fan. Let him come and save you now.\u201d</p> <p>All the accounts of the coup \u2013 even allowing for the fact that they have since been tidied into a seamless epic \u2013 agree that the president did indeed have a decisive effect on events. Erdo\u011fan had been holidaying in the southern resort of Marmaris; he was still there at 24 minutes past midnight, when he issued a televised appeal for Turks to come into the streets and defend the regime, for, as he put it, \u201cI\u2019ve yet to see a force stronger than the people.\u201d</p> <p>The number of civilians resisting the soldiers in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y suddenly leaped from a few score to thousands, a pattern replicated outside the Istanbul mayoralty, the Ankara parliament, and other flashpoints across the country. When Erdo\u011fan\u2019s plane landed at Istanbul airport at around 3am, he was met by huge crowds of supporters; three hours later, when news arrived that the Bosphorus Bridge had been liberated, the soldiers in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y turned tail. The coup was over.</p> <p>For the next few days, following the example of the loyalist media, the people of Turkey doused themselves in anger, pride, grief and exhilaration. The putschists had killed some 240 civilians, 18 of them in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y. Parliament had been bombed by F-16s. But democracy had won.</p> <aside class=\"element element-membership element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-long-read-live-at-the-hospital-club-27192843527\">The Long Read live - at the Hospital Club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What followed, however, looked less like a democratic victory than an authoritarian purge. In six weeks, more than 80,000 soldiers, civil servants, teachers, and private sector employees have been arrested, sacked or suspended. Not all of those who have been targeted appear to be connected to the movement led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/fethullah-gulen-who-is-the-man-blamed-by-turkeys-president-for-coup-attempt\">Fethullah G\u00fclen</a>, the influential US-based preacher and educationalist whom Erdo\u011fan has accused of masterminding the coup. Scores of journalists have been detained, and around 100 media outlets have been forcibly shut down. Amnesty International has raised the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.ie/latest/stories/2016/07/28/turkey-taking-big-step-backwards-human-rights/\">\u201cmass repression, torture and arbitrary detention\u201d</a> under the cover of the state of emergency that Erdo\u011fan declared on 20 July.</p> <p>For onlookers in the west, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s clampdown confirms his well-established tendency to regard his own popularity as a mandate to crush opponents. The spontaneous civilian uprising against the military coup may have represented the ultimate affirmation of the popular will \u2013 but the events that followed have deepened the contradiction between Erdo\u011fan\u2019s unquestionable democratic legitimacy and his equally indisputable authoritarian rule.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Erdogan\u2019s demokrasi may be \u201cilliberal\u201d in its practice, but it represents a forceful expression of the people\u2019s will</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The immediate reaction to the coup from American and European politicians provided evidence of their unease: both John Kerry, the US secretary of state, and Federica Mogherini, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, issued warnings to the Turks demanding that Erdo\u011fan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/european-leaders-urge-turkey-to-respect-rule-of-law-after-failed-coup\">respect democracy and the rule of law</a>. The clear implication, for listeners inside Turkey, was that Europe and America were more concerned for the thugs who had tried to seize the state than they were for its democratically elected leaders. In response, Erdo\u011fan excoriated the west for \u201csiding with the putchists\u201d.</p> <p>Words often change meaning when they change language. If Erdo\u011fan is correct to suspect that the US and EU would not have mourned his overthrow, this is because he now presides over a bespoke form of government that western leaders do not understand or appreciate. Erdogan\u2019s <em>demokrasi</em> may be \u201cilliberal\u201d in its practice, but it represents a forceful expression of the people\u2019s will \u2013 a blunt majoritarian riposte to an imagined democratic gold standard that in reality no longer exists.</p> <p>Turkey under Erdo\u011fan may be compared with Putin\u2019s Russia, Modi\u2019s India and Netanyahu\u2019s Israel. In all these places the forms of democracy have been suborned by majoritarian nationalism, bolstered to varying degrees by the security state. In fact, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s programme does not look very different to the prospectus unveiled by France\u2019s would-be strongman, Nicolas Sarkozy, whose campaign for the presidency looks likely to be defined by his promises to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/nicolas-sarkozy-declares-candidacy-french-presidential-election\">enforce majority prejudice over minority interests</a>. (His support for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/frances-highest-court-suspends-burkini-ban-in-test-case\">burkini ban</a> is a case in point.) Of course, Erdo\u011fan is an Islamist \u2013 while the others are anti-Islamists. But the new wave of elected authoritarians are nothing if not indulgent of many different varieties of nationalist phobia.</p> <p>From this perspective, Erdo\u011fan is less an aberration than the vanguard of a global trend: the dissolution of the supposedly universal democratic ideal into many indigenised \u201cversions\u201d of democracy. What makes Kerry and Mogherini\u2019s lectures even harder for Erdo\u011fan to stomach is that Europe and America are hardly exceptions to this tendency. Under the state of emergency that France\u2019s government introduced after last November\u2019s terrorist attacks, the rights of French citizens to freedom of movement and association have been formally suspended. (Turkey\u2019s government did the same following the coup.) Xenophobia has once more become a widely accepted electoral tool: consider the loud and deceitful warnings of leading Brexit campaigners that Britain would soon be swamped by millions of Turkish migrants if the UK remained inside the EU. As for the paternalistic American pluralism preached by John Kerry, this could soon be washed away by a demagogue whose conception of democracy consists of a soapbox and a baseball bat.</p> <p>It is unsurprising that Erdo\u011fan views the west\u2019s stated concern for democracy as nothing but a cynical tool of foreign policy: after all, these same countries mutely acquiesced in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/04/egypt-revolution-coup-military-intervention-analysis\">military overthrow</a> of his friend Mohamed Morsi, the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood president of Egypt, only three years ago.</p> <p>For all Erdo\u011fan\u2019s democratic shortcomings, furthermore, his country isn\u2019t a dictatorship and he isn\u2019t a fascist. Turkey\u2019s president has neither stolen elections nor launched pogroms against the country\u2019s minority Kurdish or Alevi communities. The awkward fact for Erdo\u011fan\u2019s critics is that his popularity has not been hurt by his authoritarianism; if anything, his legitimacy has been further enhanced. Two years after he ascended from the prime minister\u2019s office to the presidency, his electoral record is almost peerless: after leading his party to victory in one presidential election and five general elections, he is arguably the world\u2019s most successful democratic politician.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4daf0c6352cd2f734cc7c96125da27bd9f4810e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4daf0c6352cd2f734cc7c96125da27bd9f4810e/0_23_3480_2234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Erdo\u011fan chairs a cabinet meeting, sitting beneath a portrait of the Turkish republic\u2019s founder Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Erdo\u011fan chairs a cabinet meeting, sitting beneath a portrait of the Turkish republic\u2019s founder Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>During his 13 years in power, Erdo\u011fan and his Justice and Development party (AKP) have presided over a transformation in Turkey\u2019s fortunes: on the back of strong and stable leadership and a raft of liberalising political and economic reforms, Europe\u2019s basket case became a major economic power and a candidate for EU membership. The impetus for this transformation dates back to the 1980s and 1990s, when Turkish Islamists of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s generation were a numerical majority, and yet in political and social terms a repressed minority. The country\u2019s ruling establishment was exclusively peopled by secular-minded Kemalists, named after the founder of the Turkish republic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/nov/08/ataturk-turkey-photography-ersoy-emin\">Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk</a>; the Kemalist army repeatedly intervened to prevent governments from reflecting the wishes of a mostly devout, intermittently anti-western electorate.</p> <p>Such was the Turkey I came to know after 1996, when I went to live in Ankara as the Economist\u2019s correspondent. Atat\u00fcrk and his successors had designed their new capital in the 1920s and 1930s to be a secular, republican contrast to Istanbul, the old imperial capital and former seat of the caliphate. Three-quarters of a century later, the Kemalist regime remained militaristic and unliberalised: one constantly saw staff officers being driven from one gaunt military building to another in ancient Turkish-made Fiats. Looking back from the big hill in the south of the city, with the Sheraton blocking your view of the only major mosque, it was possible to survey the capital of one of the world\u2019s biggest Muslim countries without seeing a single minaret.</p> <p>I was struck by the hatred with which the secular elite regarded their devout compatriots. \u201cReactionary\u201d and \u201cretarded\u201d were the kinder adjectives that bureaucrats, army officers and newspaper editors attached to members of banned Islamic brotherhoods or people who sent their children to religious schools. A physical revulsion seemed to come over my emancipated female friends at the rare sight of a woman wearing the long, black body covering known in Turkey as the <em>\u00e7ar\u015faf</em>; they called these women \u201ctwo-legged cockroaches\u201d. At night, the secularists drank raki toasts to their hero Atat\u00fcrk and chain-smoked Samsun cigarettes in a line of fish restaurants in the centre of town.</p> <p>Each day, in and out of the ministry buildings went clean-shaven men in ties and women in skirts. Beards or head coverings were banned for public servants, and the only scarf one saw was on the head of the tea lady. Even after Erdo\u011fan became prime minister, in 2003, the arch-Kemalist President Ahmet Necdet Sezer refused to invite the covered Mrs Erdo\u011fan to attend Republic Day celebrations; when a reporter asked what he felt about this, Erdo\u011fan replied, \u201cput yourselves in my wife\u2019s place and decide for yourself\u201d.</p> <p>The only time I had a strong impression of being in a Muslim city was while driving to Ankara airport, past slums that were home to migrants from rural Turkey. Here, the women were covered and the men bearded; spindly minarets rose like Anatolian poplars against the sky.</p> <p>Kemalism was a big institutional fantasy according to which Turkey was a kind of warm-water Sweden. In the troubled 1990s, the country\u2019s secular establishment was associated with economic instability (inflation averaged 70%), a pitiless war against the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), and a spiteful policy that banned girls in headscarves from public universities. Turkey\u2019s allies in Nato and the EU were alive to these failures; in a country whose politicians constantly solicited the affirmation of the west, the eventual rejection of Kemalism could only take place with outside approval.</p> <p>The big winner from the west\u2019s growing disenchantment with Kemalism was Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2013 a ferry captain\u2019s son with roots in the conservative Black Sea region, who had served as a popular mayor of Istanbul since 1994. Rather than impose Islamic law on Turkey\u2019s most cosmopolitan city, as the secularists had predicted he would, Erdo\u011fan had devoted himself to improving the city\u2019s transport system, water supply, and air quality.</p> <p>When I met Erdo\u011fan in the spring of 1997, he was quick to point to the many ways in which Istanbullus\u2019 lives had got better since he became mayor. His account was hard to fault; even his secularist critics concurred that this sclerotic, corrupt old wreck of a place finally had a competent, hard-working mayor who wasn\u2019t on the take. We met on the terrace of an imperial Ottoman house that he had had restored and then opened to the public. The house itself was a symbol of his departure from the ruling order; the secularists were so disdainful of the defunct empire that they had let most of these relics crumble.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan came out on to the terrace where I was sitting with one of his aides; he was athletic and youthful and looked good in a dark suit. We were brought superb early strawberries and ate them while admiring the Bosphorus view. He smiled often as we talked, without any of the glowering pompousness he now displays regularly \u2013 but even then, I sensed a wariness that was more than the usual politician\u2019s caution; he knew that the west was still making up its mind about him.</p> <p>He flashed one of his smiles when I reminded him of the Kemalists\u2019 criticism of his decision not to allow booze in this and other municipal establishments. \u201cWhen I became mayor they said I would ban alcohol in Istanbul, but anyone who wants to drink may do so.\u201d He seemed to be saying, \u201ctime will tell\u201d.</p> <p>The doubts that many in Turkey felt towards him concerned his intentions; the previous year he had caused outrage by describing democracy as a \u201ctram ... it goes as far as we want it to go, and then we get off\u201d. That evening I upset my Turkish friends by defending too fervently a man they continued to regard as a theocrat in disguise.</p> <p>The following year, Erdo\u011fan was sentenced to 10 months in jail on risible charges of inciting a religious insurrection (he ended up serving four). He had recited some lines of martial poetry by an early Turkish nationalist, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziya_G%C3%B6kalp\">Ziya G\u00f6kalp</a>. The US consul in Istanbul came to the mayoralty to commiserate; the case, she said, would \u201cweaken confidence in Turkish democracy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"91a14cc9676774c7038c8347debef08a76dbac1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91a14cc9676774c7038c8347debef08a76dbac1b/0_57_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Erdo\u011fan with his wife Emine in 1999, the day before he was sent to prison for inciting a religious insurrection\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erdo\u011fan with his wife Emine in 1999, the day before he was sent to prison for inciting a religious insurrection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters Photographer / Reuter/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Four years after he was released from prison, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rise to prime minister in 2003 was applauded not only by conservative Turks but also by western politicians and academics who hoped that his democratic Islamism would provide an alternative path to the \u201cclash of civilisations\u201d that many regarded as inevitable in the wake of 9/11. Erdo\u011fan was praised for his commitment to something called \u201cmoderate\u201d Islam, although he bridled at the term, as most Muslims would; Islam is a God-given truth and in no need of improving qualifiers. His domestic opponents continued to accuse him of hiding his true beliefs until he had purged Kemalist institutions like the army and the judiciary.</p> <p>In its first few years in power, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s AKP introduced a slew of liberalising and democratic reforms. The notorious state security courts were scrapped, torture was curtailed, and the government put out feelers aimed at a political settlement with the Kurds. Political stability and fiscal discipline helped to cut inflation, while in pious central Anatolia \u2013 the AKP\u2019s heartland \u2013 ambitious family-run firms invested in future growth. Between 2002 and 2013 the economy expanded by an average of 5% per annum: the government used the proceeds of that growth to invest in housing, health, and education. The slums I used to drive past on the road to Ankara airport in the 1990s were replaced with smart modern flats.</p> <p>The high water mark for Erdo\u011fan and the west was 2005, when the EU and Turkey opened accession negotiations. At the time, Erdo\u011fan expressed a worldview that was notably open and optimistic. \u201cCountries on their own,\u201d he said, \u201cdo not mean \u2026 much any more. They can achieve a lot more in solidarity with their friends.\u201d</p> <p>By making himself and Turkey indispensable to the west \u2013 there was, the veteran US diplomat Richard Holbrooke declared, \u201cno country in the world of more strategic importance\u201d \u2013 Erdo\u011fan was also protecting himself against his Kemalist foes. The wisdom of this approach was demonstrated in 2007, when the general staff threatened a coup if he went ahead with plans to elevate his AKP confrere Abdullah G\u00fcl to the presidency. Instead, the EU and the US weighed in with statements of support for the elected government, Erdo\u011fan called the generals\u2019 bluff by holding early elections which he resoundingly won, and G\u00fcl moved into the presidential palace \u2013 along with his covered wife.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan was now strong enough to accelerate a process that had begun years earlier, changing the ethos of the army, which had earlier toppled three governments. Kemalist officers were retired, and Islamists brought in. In this endeavour, Erdo\u011fan was assisted by the followers of Fethullah G\u00fclen \u2013 the secretive Islamist movement that was allied with the AKP against the secular establishment for a decade until a dramatic split in 2013.</p> <p>It is likely that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s vulnerability in the early stages of his premiership made it easier for him to make friendly gestures to Kurds and liberals \u2013 constituencies well beyond the typical ambit of the Turkish Islamist. In 2004, a ban on teaching in the Kurdish language was lifted, and the prime minister repeatedly overruled plans by the military to attack PKK camps in northern Iraq; some Kurds, particularly the conscientious Muslim ones, rewarded him with their votes.</p> <p>Perhaps most surprising, in the mid-2000s Turkey gained the most vocal feminist, environmentalist and LGBT movements in the Muslim Middle East. The organisers of Istanbul\u2019s annual gay pride march called it the biggest in the Muslim world. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/19/police-use-teargas-against-lgbt-activists-in-istanbul\">This year\u2019s march was banned</a> by the authorities in Istanbul, however, citing security concerns after nationalist groups warned they would not allow it to take place.) For a while \u2013 with the exception of Turkey\u2019s roughly 15 million Alevis, whom many in the Sunni mainstream regard as renegade Muslims \u2013 Erdo\u011fan could claim to be a leader for all Turkey.</p> <p>The tragedy of modern Turkey is that all of these relationships that had begun to blossom under Erdo\u011fan \u2013 with the Kurds, with Turkish liberals, with the EU and the US \u2013 have now fallen apart again under his leadership, which only becomes more authoritarian and isolated with the crumbling of each alliance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89c09e2f2480f7d5124effd0cb0143d54f0d8444\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89c09e2f2480f7d5124effd0cb0143d54f0d8444/0_30_1993_1196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Erdo\u011fan greets his Justice and Development party supporters in Istanbul, about a month after the party won the 2002 general election.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erdo\u011fan greets his Justice and Development party supporters in Istanbul, about a month after the party won the 2002 general election.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murad Sezer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Erdo\u011fan is a proud man, sensitive to slights. He turned decisively against his old friend Bashar al-Assad when the latter rejected Erdo\u011fan\u2019s appeal for leniency towards the Syrians who began protesting against the dictator in the spring of 2011. (It has also been reported that Mrs Assad made rude remarks about the Erdo\u011fans after the two couples holidayed together, which were intercepted by Turkish intelligence.)</p> <p>Turkey\u2019s support for Syrian opposition fighters reflected Erdo\u011fan\u2019s one-time hope that a Sunni-dominated Syria would become a loyal Turkish client. Instead, the Turks have seen an influx of millions of Syrian refugees, and watched helplessly while the Syrian Kurdish allies of the PKK, which Turkey designates as a terrorist organisation, have set up autonomous cantons across the border. When Turkey bowed to American pressure and joined the coalition against Islamic State in 2014, the jihadis responded with a string of suicide attacks inside Turkey \u2013 the most recent of which, in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/20/several-dead-in-suspected-terrorist-blast-at-wedding-in-turkey\">southern city of Gaziantep</a>, on 20 August, killed 50 people.</p> <p>In the summer of 2013, weeks of protests initially sparked by the government\u2019s plans to bulldoze an Istanbul park decisively snapped whatever understanding still remained between Erdo\u011fan and Turkish liberals, millions of whom came out to demonstrate against the AKP\u2019s growing authoritarianism. (As if to prove their point, the protests were harshly put down, injuring thousands.) Finally, last summer, amid the ruins of his Syria policy, Erdo\u011fan launched a new round of fighting against the PKK that has so far cost some 1,800 lives and devastated towns across Turkish Kurdistan.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Erdo\u011fan\u2019s capacity for umbrage knows no bounds: he has brought some 2,000 suits for defamation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Turkey\u2019s unresolved application for EU membership has arguably been the most painful reverse of all. Even back in 2005, it was clear that there was a strong chance that Austria, France or Germany would block Turkey\u2019s membership because the country is too big and too Muslim. Since then, various pretexts have been found to slow the accession process to a crawl. It is now clear that Turkey will not join, but formally ending negotiations would cause yet more ill-will and jeopardise what cooperation there is, particularly on Syrian refugees.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan is a bully who has insulted his political opponents and locked up critical journalists. His reflexive response to criticism is to demand, in public: \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d (At the end of July, he directed this question at General Joseph Votel, the commander of American forces in the Middle East, who suggested that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s purge of military officers would damage the ongoing campaign against Islamic State.) Erdo\u011fan\u2019s capacity for umbrage knows no bounds: he has brought some 2,000 suits for defamation, including one against a German comic who recited a poem about him copulating with a goat.</p> <p>Even now, after 13 years of uninterrupted power and the accumulation of untold wealth, Turkey\u2019s ruling Islamists seem still to be responding to humiliations that were meted out to them by the superior, snobby, Europeanised Kemalists. Erdo\u011fan has not got where he is by taking fancy degrees or showing off his restaurant French (he is defiantly monolingual) \u2013 but through straightforward piety and political nous. Just as the Kemalists used to disparage the \u201cprimitive\u201d ways of Turkey\u2019s Islamists, so too does Erdo\u011fan deplore liberal freedoms that he regards as obstacles to development and virtue. He has compared abortions to mass murder and derides all drinkers as alcoholics; environmentalists, he has said, should move to a forest.</p> <p>During Erdo\u011fan\u2019s honeymoon with the west, foreign journalists used to remark that his rough edges had been smoothed in office; his trips abroad as prime minister, it was implied, had been the making of him. But these pats on the head reflected their wishes rather than his: in the contemptuous words of a Turkish opposition leader, Erdo\u011fan still had the style of a <em>maganda</em> \u2013 a boorish lout. (Erdo\u011fan promptly sued.)</p> <p>The liberals protesting against Erdo\u011fan in the summer of 2013 enjoyed mocking the monstrous <em>maganda</em> palace he was building for himself in Ankara \u2013 which ended up costing more than $600m and was built in brazen violation of a court ruling that it was illegal. Last October Erdo\u011fan castigated opposition leaders who dared to criticise the palace for trying to weaken a \u201cdemocratically-elected president\u201d. For Erdo\u011fan, what justifies his contempt for both the opposition and the law is the fact that he wins elections. In this view, the defeat of the attempted coup was the biggest election of all, and his most decisive victory. It was a huge and spontaneous plebiscite, and Turkey will probably never hear the end of it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"06f6129cc8adbc6419287b2a142ea46cf5898626\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06f6129cc8adbc6419287b2a142ea46cf5898626/426_922_4081_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police and civilians celebrate the thwarting of the coup, on the Bosphorus bridge in Istanbul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police and civilians celebrate the thwarting of the coup, on the Bosphorus bridge in Istanbul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emrah Gurel/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For the past few years \u2013 but especially in the past six weeks \u2013 Erdo\u011fan has redefined Turkish democracy to give himself a mandate to interpret and even anticipate the will of the majority while absolving himself of the responsibility to protect minorities.</p> <p>In his obvious aspiration to personify the nation, there is only one man who can rival him: Atat\u00fcrk. Until the final defeat of the Kemalist establishment in the late-2000s, Atat\u00fcrk was everywhere: his handsome features on the TV screens, his aphorisms emblazoned in bus stations, his name intoned in every speech. Erdo\u011fan now is as visible as Atat\u00fcrk was then \u2013 and equally protected from criticism. \u201cWith your elevated permission,\u201d the TV interviewers tiptoe, as they nervously pose their questions.</p> <p>The events of this summer have taken his popularity to a new level: a poll taken several weeks after the coup found that 68% of Turks approve of his handling of the situation. This is a lot more than the 52% of voters who propelled him to the presidency in 2014, when it seemed that the blush might be coming off the Erdo\u011fan bloom. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ad hoc supporters include Kurds \u2013 Kurdish nationalists have been sorely mistreated by G\u00fclenist policemen and judiciary officials \u2013 as well as secularists who despise the G\u00fclen movement\u2019s secretive, cultish character.</p> <p>The president\u2019s standing was not harmed by the fact that he seems to have faced considerable personal danger on the night of the coup. He escaped capture in Marmaris by a matter of minutes and the presidential jet was buzzed mid-air by rebel F-16s on its way to Istanbul\u2019s Atat\u00fcrk airport; it could only land once the control tower had been liberated from the putschists. Erdo\u011fan is a bruiser from a hardscrabble Istanbul neighbourhood, whose legendary stare of disapproval has been known to terrify grown men; few Turks would have been surprised to hear that his sang-froid did not falter even when it looked as if the coup might succeed.</p> <p>When Erdo\u011fan played semi-professional football as a young man \u2013 he declined to turn pro because his father disapproved \u2013 he was known for warning his teammates about the perils of drinking and looking at girls. Now, at 62, he is Turkey\u2019s own severe father, who refuses to let the country\u2019s honour be soiled.</p> <p>His brilliance as a communicator \u2013 an aspect that tends to be ignored by his critics \u2013 is shown to best effect when he addresses his supporters directly. But none of his speeches that I have seen can compare in intensity and sophistication to the address he delivered nine days after the coup, praising the \u201cmartyrs\u201d who lost their lives defending the nation against the coup.</p> <p>The setting was a vertiginous conference hall attached to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ostentatious new palace in Ankara. Among the crowd were the families of the martyrs, some holding framed photos of a husband or son. Some of the heroes of the resistance were also present \u2013 one on a stretcher. The president took to the stage in a dark suit and purple tie. Soon he was feeling expertly for the limits of his voice, alternating between hoarse denunciations of the coup, and low confiding riffs on the sanctity of death in the service of a holy cause.</p> <p>\u201cAfter prophethood,\u201d he said, \u201cmartyrdom is the next highest station\u201d; he confessed that he envied those who had fallen on the night of the coup. Then, he attacked the credulous G\u00fclenists, \u201cpoor fools\u201d and \u201capostates\u201d who had deluded themselves into believing that their leader was touched by divinity; for as Erdo\u011fan remonstrated sternly, \u201cwe are the slaves only of our God \u2026 only in prayer, in God\u2019s presence, do we genuflect.\u201d</p> <p>Rarely in Ankara \u2013 Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s citadel of secularism \u2013 can a speech by a politician have been so suffused with ideas of faith and infidelity. But for all his religiosity, Erdo\u011fan is arguably more of a nationalist than he is an Islamist: he is too much of a Turkish patriot to subscribe to a pan-Islamist ideology that would dissolve borders of land and ethnicity. His speech was as much about the pain and ecstasy of Turkishness as it was about God, and he quoted many stanzas of patriotic poetry \u2013 he has an excellent memory for verse and a fine delivery.</p> <p>\u201cThe martyrs\u2019 graveyard is not empty,\u201d the president declaimed, \u201cthe heroes await the earth, and the flag awaits the breeze to flutter.\u201d Returning the obvious adoration of his audience, he interrupted himself wonderingly: \u201cWhat a happy, what a blessed people we are \u2026 nowhere in the world can your equal be found.\u201d</p> <p>Of course a nation is nothing without enemies, and in Erdo\u011fan\u2019s depiction the failed coup exposed not one, but many. Referring to the mealy-mouthed reaction of Turkey\u2019s erstwhile western allies, he asked, \u201cAre we surprised?\u201d and then answered his own question with a no. \u201cAre we saddened? Yes, we are human.\u201d But what he called the \u201crebirth\u201d of 15 July had shown the Turks, he continued, that \u201cwe can expect neither justice, nor help, nor support, nor understanding from anyone \u2026 whatever we do, we\u2019ll do it ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>In this way, uniting the themes of faith, nation and death, the president piped his followers to a state of weeping, cheering helplessness. In their front rooms, at \u201cdemocracy vigils\u201d in main squares across the country, millions more watched him on screen. The following day, in conversations with ordinary Istanbullus, I heard many of them repeat phrases borrowed from Erdo\u011fan\u2019s speech \u2013 the sentiments of the leader, absorbed among the people as if by osmosis.</p> <p>The president\u2019s habit of referring to \u201cmy people\u201d; his promise to remake the Turkish state \u201croot and branch\u201d to undo the damage done by the G\u00fclenists; the economic objectives he has set for 2023, the centenary of the republic\u2019s founding \u2013 nothing here suggests a man who expects to become irrelevant. Erdo\u011fan has hollowed out the country\u2019s institutions \u2013 including the military, at long last \u2013 and has made himself even more indispensable. No problem is not of his making, and no solution possible without him.</p> <p>The constitution allows the president two five-year terms, which would take Erdo\u011fan to 2024 \u2013 21 years after he first became prime minister. But constitutions can change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b3e24740b88c456f61431147eb395b79696ff872\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3e24740b88c456f61431147eb395b79696ff872/0_84_1579_1721/917.jpg\" alt=\"The then Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan shows ioff his football skills to the Queen, in 2008\" width=\"917\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The then Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan shows off his football skills to the Queen, in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Firat Yurdakul/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The world\u2019s growing ranks of elected authoritarians may be refashioning democracy in their own image, but they still face considerable obstacles to out-and-out despotism. These regimes are defined in part by their proud disregard for the views of the minority \u2013 but an unrelenting majoritarianism hardens the opposition of the excluded.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan still operates under significant political constraints. The country\u2019s Kurdish, Alevi, and secularist communities, who distrust him intensely, add up to roughly half of Turkey\u2019s population of 75 million. For all the AKP\u2019s status as Turkey\u2019s unrivalled party of government, under Erdo\u011fan\u2019s unquestioned dominance, he has not been able to compel parliament to give him the enhanced powers of the executive presidency he covets.</p> <p>Nor does Erdo\u011fan\u2019s authority as an embodiment of Turkish Sunni conservatism mean that he is about to turn on those who do not embrace this identity; it is doubtful that he would have the support of his base to do so. A recent privately commissioned poll to which I have had access shows that while a majority of Turkish voters want a ban on alcohol and almost half would support the use of illegal means in the fight against terrorism, there is also wide support for abstract notions such as liberty and freedom of expression.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan trumpets his adherence to the will of his people, but he does not blindly pursue its whims. Having oscillated between Europhilia and Islamic fervour, universalism and isolationism, war and peace, it is clear that his political trajectory is that of a pragmatist who likes to keep his options open. His failure to pursue a ban on alcohol, despite the fact that it would please the base, is another instance of his pragmatism. That he regards secularism as useful \u2013 perhaps as a means of averting sectarian conflict \u2013 was demonstrated when he urged Mohamed Morsi to build a secular state after coming to power in Egypt in 2011.</p> <p>Even amid the purges, Erdo\u011fan has withdrawn all the suits he brought for insulting him \u2013 with the exception of the German comic, that is. He has also suspended hostilities with the main opposition party, the Alevi- and secularist-dominated Republican People\u2019s party (CHP). The CHP leader, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, himself an Alevi, was Erdo\u011fan\u2019s guest at a huge rally in Istanbul on 7 August, which allowed the president to stress the broad nature of the coalition against the coup, including people \u201cfrom all roots and of all spirits\u201d.</p> <p>Turkey is now trying to back out of its Syrian dead-end, and softening its opposition to the idea that Assad might retain a role in the postwar transition. Last week, the Turkish army joined the United States in a major cross-border offensive against Islamic State \u2013 with the additional aim of preventing the Syrian Kurds from establishing their own state on Turkey\u2019s southern border. To the north, the PKK may be preparing for a possible return to negotiations with Erdo\u011fan, having denounced the coup and announcing its readiness to help \u201cbuild a democratic Turkey\u201d.</p> <p>What that might look like is anyone\u2019s guess. The reign of Erdo\u011fan and other leaders in his mould is a clear sign that there is no longer a single model of democracy, stamped with EU or US approval, to which all countries aspire. It has long been common to contrast the emphasis laid by emerging non-western democracies on the will of the majority with the care taken by \u201cmature\u201d democracies to protect minority rights. But this flattering distinction may no longer be valid. The picture from France, the United States, and to an extent Britain suggests that a brazen majoritarianism has emerged from the crises and upheavals of the past decade. Erdo\u011fan may not resemble our stated democratic ideals, but he may be their future.

In 2010 the former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich appeared with Trump on Celebrity Apprentice<em> </em>after being impeached and removed from office for corruption.</p> <p>The show was his second choice after the judge overseeing his corruption trial refused to let him travel to Costa Rica to appear on tried to appear on<em> </em>I\u2019m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.</p> <p>Since dropping out of the presidential race, Perry first endorsed Texas senator Ted Cruz on the eve of the Iowa caucuses. However, since Trump clinched the nomination, the former Texas governor has become an active surrogate on the real estate mogul\u2019s behalf.<br></p> <p>The new season of Dancing With The Stars is scheduled to premiere on 12 September on ABC.<br></p>",
  "<p>With growing concerns over national security, and the increased threat of those wishing to divide us, there has been recent public discussion about the future of our immigration program, and whether the values and customs of some migrant groups have a place in the Australian way of life.<br></p> <p>Negative attitudes towards Muslims in Australia seem to be based on a fear of the unknown, and this perceived difference in values and culture. Attributes we typically identify as integral to the Australian way of life \u2013 like our freedom and democracy \u2013 are commonly perceived as being at odds with Islam.</p> <p>It raises an interesting question \u2013 can Australian Muslims maintain their customs and traditions but still embrace and identify with the Australian way of life?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/24/australia-broadly-tolerant-but-pockets-of-intense-prejudice-remain-report-shows\">Australia broadly tolerant but pockets of intense prejudice remain, report shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to <a href=\"http://scanlonfoundation.org.au/australians-today/\">research</a> released by the Scanlon Foundation last week, the majority of Australian Muslims have a high level of identification with Australia, with 72% reporting a sense of belonging to either a \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d extent. Of the Muslim Australians surveyed, 75% indicated that they were satisfied with their life in Australia. These positive findings suggest a sense of commitment to Australia\u2019s safety and welfare by Australian Muslims.</p> <p>That is not to say that the new research does not identify some emerging problems and challenges. While many Muslims spoke positively about their experiences of life in Australia, with particular reference to the opportunities, freedom, and security offered here, many also expressed concerns over a deterioration in relations, particularly in recent years.</p> <p>Muslim women in particular spoke of being subject to discrimination \u2013 of being spat upon, shouted at, or denied jobs. \u201cThe negativity [towards Muslims] is more now, it\u2019s higher now,\u201d said one focus group participant.</p> <p>Muslim faith focus group respondents also spoke of the frustration of being lumped together as one, homogeneous group \u2013 particularly by the media and some politicians.</p> <p>In reality, Muslim Australians are a group as diverse as the rest of Australian society. Of the approximate 480,000 Muslims in Australia, around a third were born here. The remainder come from a variety of countries, each with their own cultural nuances. On top of this geographical diversity, there are generational differences \u2013 a \u201cmassive generation gap in thinking and behaviour between people, parents, our elders who came here from overseas and settled and their kids and grandkids,\u201d as one focus group put it.</p> <p>And while almost six in 10 of all Muslim Australians indicate that they are either \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d religious, this figure varies significantly across sub-groups within the Muslim population, peaking at 80% of those born in Cyprus, and dropping as low as 20% of those born in Iran.</p> <p>This recognition of diversity within the Muslim Australian population is significant, as it not necessarily fully recognised in public discussion.</p> <p>The challenge for us all is to recognise the issues affecting the minority group within the Muslim population that report a low level of identification with Australia, and a low level of participation in community life. It is important to identify the factors that affect individuals on a personal, social and economic level and which influence their willingness to contribute to and be part of an inclusive community.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/african-migrants-australia-report-worst-discrimination-scanlon-report\">African migrants in Australia report worst discrimination, diversity study reveals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ensuring new arrivals and all sub-groups of the population, including Muslim Australians, feel a sense of belonging in Australia requires the effort and commitment of all. In relation to Australian Muslims in particular, it involves taking steps to better understand the diversity of the Australian Muslim community, the personal impact of discriminatory acts, and the difficulties of resettlement for new migrants in unfamiliar environments and alien cultures.</p> <p>For Australian Muslims, the challenge needs to be resolved not defensively but through understanding and respecting the common values that bind us together.</p> <p>It is important to understand that Australian Muslims are just as fearful and concerned for Australia\u2019s welfare as those who were born here.</p> <p>As one Muslim focus group respondent put it, \u201cWe also don\u2019t want extremism to happen, you know. We\u2019re all the same, we\u2019re all fighting the same war.\u201d</p> <p><em>Dr Hass Dellal AO is Executive Director of the Australian Multicultural Foundation.</em></p>",

In the country as a whole, violent crime is half of what it was in 1991, and has gone down 26% in the last decade. Property crime is down 43% in the past 25 years. No single year change has reversed that trend.

Hillary Clinton made the point last week in a speech about Trump\u2019s \u201clong history of racial discrimination.\u201d \u201cWhen I hear them, I think to myself: How sad. Donald Trump misses so much,\u201d Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/hillary-clinton-alt-right-racism-speech-donald-trump-nevada\">said</a>, continuing:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He doesn\u2019t see the success of black leaders in every field, the vibrancy of black-owned businesses, the strength of the black church.</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t see the excellence of historically black colleges and universities or the pride of black parents watching their children thrive. And he apparently didn\u2019t see Police Chief Brown on television after the murders of five of his officers conducting himself with such dignity. He certainly doesn\u2019t have any solutions to take on the reality of systemic racism and create more equity and opportunity in communities of color and for every American.</p> <p>It really does take a lot of nerve to ask people he\u2019s ignored and mistreated for decades, \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d Because the answer is: Everything.</p> <p>Now, Trump\u2019s lack of knowledge or experience or solutions would be bad enough.</p> <p>But what he\u2019s doing here is more sinister.</p> <p>Trump is reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.</p> <p>It\u2019s a disturbing preview of what kind of president he\u2019d be.</p> </blockquote> <p>Trump has not said what he would do to stop, for example, gun violence in some cities. <strong>Indiana governor Mike Pence</strong>, Trump\u2019s running mate, was asked on Sunday about consistent findings by Chicago police that most out-of-state guns recovered in Chicago originated in Indiana. Pence rejected the correlation between his state\u2019s lax gun laws and violent crime across the border, saying that \u201cfirearms in the hands of law abiding citizens\u201d make everyone safer.</p> <p>Trump accuses the Obama administration of a \u201crollback of criminal enforcement.\u201d Will he stop crime by hiring more cops? Does Trump advocate stop-and-frisk? Or the kind of \u201cbroken-windows\u201d law enforcement tactics his adviser Rudy Giuliani advanced in New York? Does he plan to solve urban crime with new employment, education or housing policies? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/maddiehanna/status/770305823323095040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Asked about 8-year-old girl killed by stray bullet in Camden and what a President Trump could do in city, Christie says: &quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>&mdash; Maddie Hanna (@maddiehanna) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maddiehanna/status/770305823323095040\">August 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>When do we find out?

Weiner is married to Huma Abedin, Clinton\u2019s closest aide. </p> <p>The latest messages appear to be another installment in a long-running pattern of conduct by Weiner online that has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/magazine/anthony-weiner-says-his-wife-never-agreed-to-that-documentary.html?_r=0\">made a public spectacle</a> of his marriage and recalled the sex scandals attached to Clinton\u2019s own marriage. </p> <p>Weiner resigned from Congress in 2011 after similar explicit messages came to light. His 2013 New York City mayoral bid foundered on a similar scandal.</p> <p>Weiner\u2019s Twitter account has been deleted. The Clinton campaign did not immediately reply to a request for comment. </p> <p>The Post on Monday published texts and images said to have been sent and received by Weiner about a year ago, in July 2015. The images include one that appears to have been sent by Weiner in which his young son, asleep, is visible in the background.</p> <p>As his mayoral bid collapsed, Abedin, already anticipating Clinton\u2019s presidential run, appeared alongside Weiner and expressed support for him. She did not appear at a concession speech he gave at the end of the campaign. She travels constantly with Clinton.</p> <p>The disintegrating mayoral bid, and the couple\u2019s efforts to prevent the same from happening to their marriage, were the subject of an award-winning documentary released this year, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT1Ib42ubOAhVMmx4KHWK2B_MQFggoMAI&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffilm%2F2016%2Fmay%2F20%2Fanthony-weiner-documentary-political-lessons&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZFTqi1gJNsVSuoS-vTvtDH-TyoQ&amp;sig2=bfEm_RSy2sbUOdkNQ2SQPg&amp;bvm=bv.131286987,d.dmo\">Weiner</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Weiner revealed that Abedin <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/magazine/anthony-weiner-says-his-wife-never-agreed-to-that-documentary.html?_r=0\">never agreed</a> to the documentary. </p> <p>Update: Donald Trump has sent a tweet <strong>questioning Clinton\u2019s judgment,</strong> without mentioning Weiner by name:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/770252177512230912\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Crooked Hillary&#39;s brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or, as stated by Bernie S, she has BAD JUDGEMENT</p>&mdash; Donald J.
