  "<p>Theresa May has been warned to expect a \u201cfull-blown constitutional crisis\u201d unless agreement on the terms of Brexit can be reached between the government and the UK\u2019s devolved administrations. </p> <p>The stark prediction comes as the prime minister hosts talks on Monday with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for the first time since the UK voted to leave the EU on 23 June.</p> <p>In a report published on Monday, the <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/\">Institute for Government</a> said unless all four leaders agree on the \u201ccore planks\u201d of the UK\u2019s negotiating position before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">May triggers article 50</a>, formally starting the Brexit<strong> </strong>process, the result could be \u201ca serious breakdown in relations between the four governments and nations of the UK\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/24/brexit-strategy-scotland-wales-northern-ireland-direct-line-david-davis-theresa-may\">May is preparing to offer</a> Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, the Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, and Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister, Arlene Foster, and her deputy, Martin McGuinness, a \u201cdirect line\u201d to the Brexit secretary, David Davis, to allow them to help shape Britain\u2019s EU exit strategy.</p> <p>But the offer is made against a background of continuing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/23/scotland-equal-partner-brexit-talks-holyrood\">clashes between May and Sturgeon</a> over who has a more substantial mandate regarding Scotland\u2019s relationship with the UK and Europe, and as the devolved administration leaders present an increasingly united front against Westminster.</p> <p>Ahead of the joint ministerial committee (JMC) meeting on Monday, in a letter to May, Sturgeon formally endorsed a proposal from Jones that any planned negotiating package should be subject to a vote in all four UK parliaments and assemblies.</p> <p>Anticipating that the three devolved governments would seek such a vote, the Institute for Government noted that although the UK parliament remains sovereign and could legally ignore the views of Holyrood, Cardiff Bay and Stormont, this would be a \u201creckless strategy for a government committed to the union\u201d. </p> <p>The organisation warned that forcing the devolved administrations to comply \u201cwould seriously undermine relationships between the four governments, and increase the chances of Scottish independence and rifts in Northern Ireland\u2019s fragile power-sharing arrangements\u201d.</p> <p>May will make the offer of a new official forum, which would be chaired by Davis and meet at least twice before the end of the year, and insist that \u201cit is imperative that the devolved administrations play their part in making [Brexit negotiations] work.\u201d</p> <p>By placing future discussions on a formal footing, May will say she is giving the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish leaders \u201cthe chance for them all to put forward their proposals on how to seize the opportunities presented by Brexit and deliver the democratic decision expressed by the people of the UK\u201d.</p> <p>Sturgeon has already said she will push for substantial additional powers for Holyrood as part of article 50 negotiations, including over international trade deals and immigration.</p> <p>But this appeared to be rebuffed by Davis during a visit to Scotland on Friday, when he insisted that any arrangements to leave the EU would be a \u201cUnited Kingdom deal\u201d.</p> <p>A Downing Street source said while the JMC had existed since devolution, the discussions over Brexit had provided a new impetus for its work.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt will be the formal forum in which the devolved administrations feed in their ideas and make their case on what is important around Brexit,\u201d the source said.</p> <p>While the relevant secretaries of state for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would continue to speak for their administrations in parliament, JMC meetings are \u201ca chance for the devolved administration leaders as well,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey do have a voice that needs to be heard and a role to play. And as the prime minister has repeatedly made clear, we\u2019re leaving the EU as the UK.\u201d</p> <p>May is also expected to discuss the government\u2019s position on the Brexit strategy at the JMC and say that contrary to some speculation, no final decisions have been taken and how the UK leaves the EU will not boil down to a binary choice.</p> <p>Although May called for a \u201cnew grown-up relationship\u201d between Westminster and the devolved administrations ahead of the meeting, the war of words between the Scottish and UK governments has continued since Thursday, when Sturgeon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/20/second-scottish-independence-referendum-bill-published\">published a draft bill</a> on a second independence referendum.</p> <p>The Scottish National party leader said she had a clear mandate to hold a second vote, because the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/scottish-labour-facing-third-place-after-collapse-in-vote\">SNP had been elected</a> in May on a manifesto commitment to do so, should there be a \u201csignificant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will\u201d.</p> <p>Sturgeon has promised to work with progressive parties and Conservative moderates across the UK to seek to avert a hard Brexit and bring forward proposals to protect Scotland\u2019s place in the single market, even if the rest of the UK leaves.</p> <p>However, a Number 10 spokesperson immediately dismissed the plan for a second vote. \u201cThe prime minister and the government does not believe that there is a mandate for one,\u201d they said. \u201cThere was one only two years ago. There was an extremely high turnout and there was a resounding result in favour of Scotland remaining in the UK.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/24/eu-referendum-how-britain-voted-for-brexit-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4mjmt\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2573253\"            data-video-name=\"EU referendum: how Britain voted for Brexit \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Various\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-576cb4f7e4b0f430381097cc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded2_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded2_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded2_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/24/eu-referendum-how-britain-voted-for-brexit-video\">EU referendum: how Britain voted for Brexit \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>Calais has become a political battle ground for France, as pressure on politicians to tear up the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/25/french-border-deal-wont-be-affected-by-brexit-paris\">Le Touquet accord</a>, the deal between France and Britain that keeps border checks on the French side of the Channel, has increased.</p> <p>Alain Jupp\u00e9, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/01/alain-juppe-from-cold-grey-automaton-to-saviour-of-france\">the current favourite</a> to become the next French president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/alain-juppe-france-managing-migrants-uk-calais-kent-border\">told the Guardian</a> last week that he wanted to completely renegotiate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/25/french-border-deal-wont-be-affected-by-brexit-paris\">Le Touquet</a>. \u201cWe can\u2019t tolerate what is going on in Calais, the image is disastrous for our country and there are also extremely serious economic and security consequences for the people of Calais,\u201d Jupp\u00e9 said in an interview in Paris.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/are-you-affected-by-the-events-at-the-calais-camp\">Are you affected by the events at the Calais camp?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSo the first thing is to denounce the Le Touquet accord. We cannot accept making the selection on French territory of people that Britain does or doesn\u2019t want. It\u2019s up to Britain to do that job,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/no-10-rejects-alain-juppes-threats-to-push-uk-border-from-calais-to-kent\">rejected the suggestion</a> from the French presidential hopeful that the border, which keeps thousands of migrants from British shores, could be moved from the French port of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/calais\">Calais</a> to Kent.</p> <p>A source made clear that the prime minister would expect any French leader to maintain the agreement. France and the UK concluded the Treaty of Le Touquet on 4 February 2003. The bilateral agreement places part of Britain\u2019s border with France in Calais, meaning that British border forces can carry out passport checks in Calais rather than in Dover.</p> <p>Political rhetoric around Calais has heightened in recent months following British voters\u2019 decision to leave the European Union. Following the vote, Xavier Bertrand, head of the Hauts-de-France region that includes the camp in Calais, insisted the bilateral agreement had to be \u201cdenounced\u201d \u2013 in other words, unilaterally terminated. \u201cThe British people have chosen to take back their freedom, they must take back their borders,\u201d the former centre-right minister told the Telegraph at the time.</p> <p>But in August British and French interior ministers<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/uk-plays-down-calais-border-tensions-with-critical-ally-france\"> confirmed they would continue with the treaty</a> under which British border checks are carried out on French soil. A joint statement issued by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, and her French counterpart, Bernard Cazeneuve, said they would work together to strengthen security around the \u201cshared border\u201d in Calais and \u201cstrongly diminish\u201d the migratory pressures that have attracted at least 7,000 migrants to the Channel tunnel port.</p> <p>The resurgence of Nicolas Sarkozy \u2013 who is one of the frontrunners to be the election candidate for Les R\u00e9publicains \u2013 has added pressure upon the French socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.</p> <p>During a visit to the camp in August, Sarkozy \u2013 who as interior minister signed up to the treaty in 2003 as part of a deal to close a former migrant centre in Sangatte \u2013 suggested migrants should be processed across the Channel. \u201cThose who are here in Calais and who want to cross to England should be processed in England by the English,\u201d he said. </p> <p>In September, Hollande took a harder line on Calais saying that Britain had to accept more migrants and warned that it could not avoid its \u201cresponsibilities to France\u201d.<br></p> <p>In his first visit to Calais since he was elected in 2012, the French president promised to \u201ccompletely and definitively\u201d close the Calais migrant camp by the end of the year but warned that Brexit did not mean that the UK could \u201cwaive its obligations\u201d and must \u201cplay its part\u201d in resolving the crisis.</p>",
  "<p>Lewis Hamilton\u2019s 50th Formula One victory was also one of his most imperious as he beat his arch-rival Nico Rosberg into second place in Sunday\u2019s US Grand Prix.</p> <p>The fact it was also his first win for three months, since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/31/lewis-hamilton-wins-german-grand-prix-f1-championship-lead-nico-rosberg\" title=\"\">the German Grand Prix at the end of July</a>, lent an extra zest to the podium champagne. The result cut Rosberg\u2019s lead in the drivers\u2019 world championship from 33 to 26 points with three races now remaining. It was Hamilton\u2019s fourth victory in the five races that have been held here and his fifth in the US following his success in Indianapolis in 2007. Overall only Michael Schumacher (91) and Alain Prost (51) have won more races.</p> <p>It was here, of course, that Hamilton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/25/lewis-hamilton-wins-f1-world-title-third-time-us-grand-prix\" title=\"\">clinched his third world title</a> a year ago, a race followed by cap-throwing scenes between the two Mercedes drivers. Since then, though, Rosberg had won 12 of the following 20 races, before this one, and he remains favourite to win his first world championship.</p> <p>He only has to finish at least second in Mexico, Brazil and Abu Dhabi to take the title. That is why he did not look too disconsolate in defeat here. But he knows he is up against a team-mate who appears restored to his finest form following his bad eight days <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/02/daniel-ricciardo-wins-malaysian-grand-prix-lewis-hamilton-f1\" title=\"\">in Malaysia</a> and Japan in which he suffered an engine failure, made a dreadful start and also fell out with the media after some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/06/lewis-hamilton-f1-under-fire-snapchat-bunny-app\" title=\"\">strange behaviour in a couple of press conferences</a>.</p> <p>It was hardly a race worthy of the glitzy billing it received but no one seemed to mind much. After successive years of declining crowds since the first race here in 2012 the figures at the Circuit of the Americas have been up this weekend, boosted by the 100,000 turnout for the Taylor Swift concert on Saturday evening.</p> <p>In brilliant sunshine the atmosphere and the entire afternoon contrasted happily with last year\u2019s monsoon conditions. The future of the Austin race \u2013 the 10th venue for Formula One in the US \u2013 has often been cause for speculation but on this showing it looks assured and there was a beaming smile on the face of Chase Carey, representing the new owners, Liberty Media.</p> <p>It was not a great afternoon for everybody, however. Nico H\u00fclkenberg was soon out of the race after being hit from behind by Valtteri Bottas. And later there were high-profile retirements in Max Verstappen (gearbox) and Kimi Raikkonen, who was told to pull over following a mishap in the pits.</p> <p>There were no such dramas at the head of the field. Hamilton completed his most difficult work of the afternoon within the opening seconds of the race; he got off to a fine start. Five times this season \u2013 in Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Italy and Japan \u2013 Hamilton has made poor starts and that has cost him more dearly than his various engine failures.</p> <p>But here he climbed up the steep hill towards the first corner keeping Rosberg behind him. Rosberg did have a run on his team-mate, on the outside, and at one point made a small gain on him.</p> <p>But his ambitions backfired when he found himself running wide into the opening bend, allowing Daniel Ricciardo, on faster, super-soft tyres, to pass him on the inside.</p> <p>By the end of the opening lap Hamilton\u2019s lead was already 0.8sec as he maintained his fine form of the previous, pole-winning day. After that he began to stretch away, while Rosberg struggled to get past Ricciardo.</p> <p>The Australian managed to get eight laps out of his extra-soft rubber before coming for a set of softs.</p> <p>He returned to the field in eighth place and finished third, missing out on the chance to beat Rosberg because of the deployment of the virtual safety car when Verstappen broke down.</p> <p>Despite Hamilton\u2019s serene progress up front there were signs of confusion on the Mercedes pitwall. They told Rosberg: \u201cWe are going for the long game, push hard now Nico\u201d to which the championship leader replied: \u201cPushing hard is not the long game.\u201d Precisely.</p> <p>Mercedes were also going to bring Hamilton in for an early pit stop but changed their minds and brought Rosberg in instead, closely followed by Hamilton.</p> <p>Nothing, however, could disrupt the composure of the world champion who produced one of his most commanding performances of the year at a time when knew he had to.</p> <p>This was another showing of the summer form Hamilton displayed when he won six races out of seven. He made a second pit stop but at the end of the race his winning margin was 4.5sec.</p> <p>It was a result that maintains interest in the destination of the world championship with three races to go, but to make it really compelling needs a non-finish by Rosberg.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/oct/23/f1-us-grand-prix-live\">F1: US Grand Prix \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>",

However, police were expected to start with a soft approach on Monday given the huge presence of national and foreign media.</p> <p>Fran\u00e7ois Guennoc, of French aid group L\u2019Auberge des Migrants, which works in the Calais camp, said the closure was rushed and ill-considered. \u201cThe camp is being cleared in haste, without preparation. That\u2019s why our group was one of several aid organisations that went to court to delay this move in order for the proper time for preparation to happen and a process to study people\u2019s cases,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut the courts gave the government the go-ahead to begin clearing it. The government argued that if they waited, more people would arrive.\u201d <br></p> <p>Pascal Brice, the director of Ofpra, which handles asylum requests in France, said there had been a big increase in the number of people in Calais making asylum requests in France.</p> <p>Since the start of 2015, between 7,000 and 10,000 people across the country had asked for asylum after Ofpra began a drive to increase applications in Calais. He said 70% of those who had applied for asylum had been given refugee status in France. \u201cWe are doing the job that the British aren\u2019t doing,\u201d Brice said.</p> <p>An additional 3,000 police are expected in and around Calais this week. A frantic game of cat and mouse is likely to unfold, as migrants who do not want to claim asylum in France try to avoid officers, who will attempt to prevent small camps from springing up in the region. <br></p> <p>Almost two-thirds of migrants surveyed in the camp said they did not want to be evicted and taken to French accommodation, while one-third said they would continue to try to get to the UK, according to the <a href=\"http://refugeerights.org.uk/\">Refugee Rights Data Project</a>.<br></p> <p>Just over one-quarter of 429 people living in the camp and surveyed between early September and early October said they would prefer to sleep in the street, while 15% said they would rather go to a different country.

But those factors \u2013 Catholicism, misogyny, an obsession with controlling women\u2019s bodies \u2013 sound more archaic with each passing year. Within Ireland, consistent polling shows there is now a desire for women not to be criminalised for abortions and for the constitutional ban on abortion to be repealed. The tangible obstacle is the eighth amendment to the constitution, which was inserted after a referendum in 1983. This clause states: \u201cThe state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.\u201d</p> <p>Before any abortion legislation can be enacted, this amendment (which effectively puts the life of the unborn on a par with the life of the mother) needs to be overturned by referendum. But Irish women are no longer waiting for change to come. We are demanding it, and asking our allies to help.</p> <p>The movement to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/repealthe8th?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag\" title=\"\">repeal the 8th</a> is growing, especially since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/23/gay-marriage-ireland-yes-vote\" title=\"\">equal marriage referendum</a> last year inspired a generation of young Irish people. In the days after that referendum, the question that Irish people hear repeatedly from abroad was raised: how can Ireland have gay marriage and not abortion? It\u2019s one that can only be answered by acknowledging that misogyny in Ireland runs even deeper than homophobia.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>British people need to stomp on the streets and on the floors of parliament to help shame our government</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What the equal marriage referendum taught us was that change comes from the bottom up.

The recent <a href=\"http://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/event/march-for-choice-2016/\" title=\"\">March for Choice</a> in Dublin was replicated in cities around the world, with tens of thousands of people turning out to demand reproductive rights.</p> <p>Sweeping things under the carpet is a national sport in Ireland, but at last, women\u2019s personal stories are informing a movement in a way that was impossible in the past because of social taboos. We have a torrid history of oppressing women, thanks to the power the Catholic church once wielded in collusion with the state. Women are now telling their abortion stories in great numbers for the first time, and as we learned during the equal&#xa0;marriage referendum campaign, you can\u2019t beat real-life experiences with&#xa0;abstract&#xa0;arguments.</p> <p>Successive Irish governments haven\u2019t&#xa0;listened to their female citizens. But what Irish governments really dislike is being embarrassed from abroad. As a nation, we are insecure, obsessed with our identity and what people think of us. So if politicians don\u2019t have the guts to tackle this issue then they need to be shamed into action.</p> <p>Solidarity matters because the extended hand often feels so much warmer than your own. The idea that people you don\u2019t even know care about you is important. It bolsters you.

  "<p>Standing near muddy puddles and tents buffeted by the wind in the squalid shantytown for refugees and migrants in Calais, Aaron, 16, from Eritrea, was frightened. </p> <p>He knew that something big was about to begin in the fetid, freezing camp that for five months had served as his home. He had heard that the more than 6,000 refugees and migrants sleeping rough here \u2013 many hoping to enter the UK \u2013 were about to be rounded up by the French government this week, put onto buses and sent across France.

Last year, his widowed mother decided to flee local violence with her only child, then aged 15. But on a trek through desert with not enough food and water, he became separated from his mother and had not been able to find her. All he knew was that she wanted them to get to England. So he continued on alone to Libya and then to Italy by boat, where he saw \u201cmany, many people\u201d drown.</p> <p>\u201cI have to get to England,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where my mother was going and it\u2019s my only hope of finding her. At night I have such bad nightmares. I just want to find my mum.\u201d</p> <p>He had no other family in England and had spent time in the camp improving his English and doing art projects with volunteers. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the schools are good in England. I speak English, I want to go to school, I want to learn.\u201d </p> <p>With other teenagers, he had been trying at night to jump on the backs of lorries and stow away, but the French police always pulled him out, \u201chitting me or teargassing me\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/17/refugees-hope-and-despair-in-calais-camp-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/57q8c\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2814168\"            data-video-name=\"Refugees' hope and despair in Calais camp \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58049584e4b047a4eaafd52d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/17/161117CalaisTensions2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/17/161117CalaisTensions2_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/17/161117CalaisTensions2.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/17/refugees-hope-and-despair-in-calais-camp-video\">Refugees\u2019 hope and despair in Calais camp</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The operation to raze the notorious Calais refugee and migrant camp to the ground <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/23/france-prepares-to-demolish-calais-refugee-camp\">begins on Monday</a> and will last at least a week.

Then a total of between 6,000 and 8,000 refugees and migrants in the camp will be gradually ushered to a vast hangar nearby. They will be given the choice of two different regions in France, then they will be placed into four separate queues \u2013 adults, unaccompanied minors, families and vulnerable people \u2013 to wait for the coaches that will drive them to processing accommodation centres across towns and villages in France. </p> <p>But the demolition of the sprawling Calais camp \u2013 which sprang up last year after police deliberately moved people from squats across Calais onto one piece of wasteland \u2013 is unlikely to permanently resolve the 20-year-old problem of migrants stranded in France trying to reach Britain. Local French aid groups said they believed hundreds of people had already left the camp and could be sleeping rough across the north coast.</p> <p>Aid workers said squats would spring up elsewhere in Calais as some migrants still tried to reach the UK. Elsewhere in France, although many volunteer groups have helped refugees, the right and far-right have championed a \u201cnot in my village\u201d movement in recent weeks to protest against migrants and refugees from Calais being housed in small centres in towns dotted around the country.

He wanted to study to be a doctor and had applied for asylum in France. \u201cAnywhere in France is safer than what I\u2019ve fled in Afghanistan, and it can\u2019t be worse than this camp,\u201d he said. </p> <p>He had been sleeping in two sleeping bags against the cold, often soaked with rain and sometimes woken by teargas in his tent from police trying to stop potential stowaways running out onto the motorway nearby. </p> <p>He could not believe he might be given a bed in a French processing accommodation centre. \u201cIt would be the first time I\u2019ve slept in a bed for more than a year.\u2026\u201d</p> <p>With bare feet poking out of broken shoes that were too small, he had no possessions to pack and no bag. \u201cA charity worker said she might be able to give me a bag \u2013 I\u2019ll just put my asylum papers in it. I don\u2019t possess anything else, not even a pair of socks.\u201d</p> <p>Imran, 19, also from Afghanistan, had a cousin who worked in a supermaket in Birmingham. \u201cI always wanted to get to England to join him. Every night I try to get on a truck, but it\u2019s almost impossible. I might stay around Calais to keep trying, or I might give up and stay in France, I just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p> <p>Walking through the camp, a 20-year-old single woman from Ethiopia, who had family in London, said she would stay around Calais: \u201cAll I want is to get to England. I\u2019m not scared any more. I can\u2019t go home. I have seen so many frightening things, people die, that I\u2019ll just keep going, unafraid.\u201d</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed</em></p>",

  "<p>A voluptuous portrait of Emma Hamilton, commissioned by her husband and later bought by her lover Lord Nelson to save it from the shame of a public sale, is to be displayed in a major exhibition on her extraordinary life.</p> <p>\u201cShe was a really remarkable person, who has usually been seen only in the shadows of the men in her life. It is time to bring her back into the light,\u201d said Quintin Colville, curator of the exhibition that opens at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, next month.</p> <p>The portrait has been in private collections since it was completed, and has not been exhibited in the UK for almost half a century.<br></p> <p>Colville, like many men before him, has fallen heavily for Emma, the blacksmith\u2019s daughter who became an aristocratic diplomat\u2019s wife and the mistress of one of the most famous men of the day. He told the Guardian he finds it hard to forgive the artist, \u00c9lisabeth Louise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/15/vigee-le-brun-painter-french-royalty\">Vig\u00e9e Le Brun</a>, for being so rude about Emma, who had been typically kind to her when Vig\u00e9e Le Brun came to the Naples court as a refugee from the French Revolution.</p> <p>Emma was far more famous in that circle than Vig\u00e9e Le Brun, and was renowned for her \u201cattitudes\u201d, theatrical exhibitions of poses drawn from classical art and literature, including her husband\u2019s famous collection of Greek vases. Her performances were essential viewing for visitors to Naples, including the German writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johann-wolfgang-von-goethe\">Goethe</a>, who described her as \u201cexceedingly beautiful\u201d, and said she brought the ancient world to life \u201cas if one were in some dream\u201d.</p> <p> In 1791, Sir William Hamilton took the then Emma Hart as his mistress from his nephew and then married her when he was 61 and she was 26. The blacksmith\u2019s daughter became Lady Hamilton, an ambassador\u2019s wife and society hostess. Many regarded the match as shocking, but it was nothing to the scandal that followed. When a wounded Nelson came to convalesce in Naples, Lady Hamilton nursed him back to health and the two fell passionately in love. Instead of throwing her out and challenging Nelson to a duel, her husband remained on affectionate terms with both of them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b24c0147c3f998d7f2a5bb748d3260e587ebd3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b24c0147c3f998d7f2a5bb748d3260e587ebd3f/0_0_6049_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A devotional book Emma Hamilton gave to Horatia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"819\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A devotional book Emma Hamilton gave to Horatia, her daughter by Nelson, is among the objects on display.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Stokes/National Maritime Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/12/vigee-le-brun-metropolitan-museum-of-art-woman-artist-revolutionary-france\">Vig\u00e9e Le Brun: artist to the aristocracy who played and changed the game</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHamilton greatly admired Nelson, and he was unquestionably extremely fond of Emma. He didn\u2019t want to lose her, he was getting old, and I think he wanted a comfortable life spending time with his collections and his books, surrounded by people he liked,\u201d Colville said.<br></p> <p>The portrait shows Lady Hamilton as either a bacchante or Ariadne, daughter of King Minos of Crete in Greek mythology. Colville notes her expression of sleepy satisfaction, and the little ship sailing away in the background, and wonders if there is a sly reference to Nelson.</p> <p>Vig\u00e9e Le Brun went on to paint many more highly saleable portraits of Hamilton \u2013 who was already the muse and favourite model of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/jun/02/1\">the artist George Romney</a> \u2013 and said of her: \u201cI could have copied her different poses ... and filled a gallery with paintings.\u201d</p> <p>However, she also wrote in her diary: \u201cLady Hamilton was not very intelligent, though she was exceedingly mocking and denigrating, to the point that her faults were her only means of conversation. But she was cunning, and this helped her to snare a husband.\u201d</p> <p>The exhibition will include many loans from private collections, including touchingly modest objects that belonged to Lady Hamilton, which have never been displayed before. Almost everything she owned was scattered in sales after Nelson died at Trafalgar in 1805, two years after Sir William. She ended up poorer than when she was born, having been released from a debtor\u2019s prison to die penniless in Calais in 1815.</p> <p>The objects will include a little needle book with nautical scenes owned by Horatia, her daughter by Nelson, and a devotional book she gave her, inscribed \u201ca life well spent makes old age pleasant and honourable\u201d, but signed \u201cEmma Hamilton\u201d rather than as her mother.</p> <p>Both Sir William and Nelson loved the Vig\u00e9e Le Brun portrait. Sir William left a miniature version to Nelson in his will, \u201ca very small token of the great regard I have for his Lordship, the most virtuous, loyal and truly brave character I ever met with\u201d. Nelson, when he learned the original was to be sold, wrote to Lady Hamilton: \u201cMy dearest friend you are on SALE: I am almost mad to think of the iniquity.\u201d He paid \u00a3300 for it, and kept it over his bed for the rest of his life.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.rmg.co.uk/see-do/emma-hamilton-seduction-and-celebrity\">Emma Hamilton, Seduction and Celebrity</a> runs from 3 November 2016 to 17 April 2017.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 October 2016.

  "<p>Once the preserve of monastic retreats and hardcore meditators, simply being quiet is growing in appeal. Whole businesses have sprung up to meet a rising demand for quiet time, from silent weekend getaways to silent dining, silent reading parties and even silent dating. This month sees the release of documentary In Pursuit of Silence, a \u201cmeditative film\u201d about our relationship with noise, promoted with a delicate two-minute trailer in which not a word is uttered.</p> <p>Silence can, as the film attests, mean different things to different people. It can be a space for quiet reflection or a state fraught with discomfort. There is a certain intimacy inherent in being silent with other people \u2013 we usually do so only with those closest to us. So there is something almost radical about the recent trend for enjoying silence with strangers.</p> <p>Mariel Symeonidou started a regular silent reading party in Dundee just under a year ago, in a moment of \u201cuncharacteristic extroversion\u201d. Readers bring their books and meet in a bar, where they read together in silence for an hour or sometimes two, then put the books away to chat and have a drink.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e0b51e9b369c78a434d467251ca4724fa9e7394\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e0b51e9b369c78a434d467251ca4724fa9e7394/0_72_2953_1773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meditating in Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meditating in Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fairfax Media/Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The concept began in the dimly lit, retro-furnished cafes and bars of Seattle. Devised as a literary hangout for those who don\u2019t like spoken-word nights or discussion groups, the premise was simple: show up, shut up and read. The trend has spread to New York and since found a home in the UK, in London and Edinburgh as well as Dundee.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the reading starts, everything goes quiet,\u201d says Symeonidou. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit surreal, especially in what is usually a bustling bar. However, there is something special about sharing that silence with others. It offers an opportunity for escapism; everyone is so busy with work and with technology being ever present. An event like this gives people the opportunity to escape these things for a while.\u201d</p> <p>While the readings are now tranquil and relaxed, Mariel concedes initial iterations were a little awkward. This discomfort is precisely where the radical power of silence lies, says Matthew Adams, a lecturer in psychology at the University of Brighton. \u201cSilence is often something we experience as uncomfortable, as a rupture in the social fabric, an awkwardness we want to cover over with our voices.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/26/five-of-the-best-meditation-apps\">Five of the best meditation apps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Adams has a long-term interest in the social, cultural and psychological significance of silence, and particularly in shared silence and electing to share silence. \u201cCollective silence is about connecting with others in a way that gets underneath social conventions. It confronts us with what it feels like to be in the physical presence of other human beings without any games, strategies, reading or misreading of intentions. It is a temporary suspension of our reliance on talk.\u201d</p> <p>The absence of chatter can have social advantages. London\u2019s silent speed-dating event organisers Shhh! say that we are \u201cinstinctively better at communicating and choosing the right partners when we have the chance to put aside words and see each other as we really are\u201d.</p> <p>Shhh! hosts regular speed-dating sessions and singles events, featuring \u201cnon-verbal flirting games\u201d and \u201ceye-gazing\u201d; neatly side-stepping all the what-are-you-watching-on-Netflix questions. Claimed to be a favourite with \u201ccreative professionals in their 20s and 30s\u201d, Shhh! boasts a busy programme of events until the end of the year. The sessions begin with games to break the ice, including jumping around in front of a potential mate and making \u201cpaleolithic noises\u201d. Then comes a somewhat standard speed-dating set-up; attendees are paired off for a limited window of time, communicating only with gestures, before engaging in 60 seconds of uninterrupted eye contact. After the event you are dutifully furnished with the contact details of interested parties and if you\u2019re lucky enough to land a second date, you can maintain the established embargo on chit-chat, whisking them off for a silent dinner date or a mute trip to the pictures.</p> <p>Honi Ryan is an artist based in Berlin who began hosting silent dinners back in 2006. An otherwise ordinary dinner party setup, albeit with a ritzy vegan menu (regular dishes include baked almond soy mushrooms and Lebanese beans), the rules of the dinner are: no talking, no using your voice, no reading or writing, try to make as little noise as possible, do not interact with technology, and stay for at least two hours.</p> <p>Ryan describes the silent dinners as \u201csocial sculptures\u201d engaging with \u201cthe changing nature of communication and the space between people\u201d. So far she has taken her silent dining project to Mexico, the US, Australia, Lebanon and China. The global reach is fundamental to the project, as is the inclusive and international menu. \u201cIt\u2019s evident that the age-old connections we make over food do not depend on the words around it. \u201cSilence creates the space for the people and places involved to fill with whatever is needed; it strips away our rehearsed social behaviours.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30bf91fad24ed1c552657eb508e03e13740cda95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30bf91fad24ed1c552657eb508e03e13740cda95/56_0_2250_1350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Pursuit of Silence \u2026 the art of finding stillness within yourself.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Pursuit of Silence \u2026 the art of finding stillness within yourself.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps the most well-known silent social is the silent retreat. Recently featured in an episode of BBC comedy Fleabag, silent retreats vary in tone and purpose, and are more popular than you might imagine. The retreats often have a religious or spiritual element, with Buddhist, Christian and Catholic retreats making up the majority. They can last anywhere between a couple of days to a few weeks, set in locations that are usually fittingly pastoral, in old farm buildings or country piles.</p> <p>Silent retreat regular Peter Cadney first discovered the power of silence on a 10-day vipassana silent meditation course, in 2013. The technique emphasises developing a connection with silence and accessing the \u201cstillness\u201d within yourself.</p> <p>\u201cThere had been a number of events in my life that I hadn\u2019t been able to deal with very well; things like relationship breakups and the death of a close friend. I\u2019d spent years working at a computer and was feeling the effects of muscle tension, anxiety and stress. I felt drawn to finding somewhere quiet to sit in order to find peace within myself.\u201d</p> <p>Cadney says silent meditation has helped to improve both his mental and physical health. \u201cWhen I first sat down in silence, it felt very peaceful. I started noticing just how many thoughts were coming and going in my mind, it was as if there had been no space for silence.\u201d</p> <p>Cadney has since given up his office job and now works as a holistic therapist. \u201cAs soon as I sat down in that meditation hall I thought: this is where I am supposed to be.\u201d</p> <p>Swiss Artist Salome Voegelin also found a purpose in silence. However, rather than finding silence soothing or nulling somehow, it instead opened her mind to the \u201cradical possibility of hearing\u201d. She describes silence, not as the absence of sound, but as the beginning of listening, though she has some reservations about the \u201cegotistical tendencies\u201d of the current trend for silent getaways.</p> <p>\u201cWhile these events are contemplative and respectful, I wonder how much of the silent listening is spent obsessing about one\u2019s own silence rather than hearing others and the environment,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Voeglin\u2019s book, Listening to Noise and Silence: Towards a Philosophy of Sound Art posits silence and noise not as opposites but as different ends of the same spectrum. \u201cThere is no true silence. It\u2019s a state that allows me to hear my breathing in tandem with yours, the rumbling of my stomach, the gurgling of the radiator. It provides a time out. It\u2019s when we start to listen to each other.\u201d</p> <p>Silence assumes a new meaning in an era in which we are consuming information and engaging in conversation with each other endlessly, without ever opening our mouths. While we may watch The Pursuit of Silence and enjoy the absence of sound, how many of us will be tempted to check in with our emails, tweet our thoughts on the film? While we might find pleasure in those rare and cherished moments of peace and quiet, when it comes to silence and stillness, can we muster up the self-restraint at all?</p> <p><em>In Pursuit of Silence is on release now.</em></p>",

This brought an immediate rebuke from Farage, who was appearing on another show, ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday, immediately afterwards.</p> <p>\u201cFor her to talk about the party being toxic, for her to already declare one of the candidates who is running, Raheem Kassam, as being far right, I don\u2019t view this as being a very good start,\u201d said Farage.</p> <p>\u201cI have to say they are the sort of things she said to me \u2013 after the general election, she said to me I shouldn\u2019t take any part at all in the referendum campaign, I was toxic, immigration shouldn\u2019t be discussed with the British public. I think she has been in the wrong place ever since that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Farage added: \u201cI won\u2019t be voting for her, not after that, no.\u201d</p> <p>Disagreement between the two is not new. Evans was once close to Farage but was prevented from standing in the election which saw James voted in as she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/23/ukip-suzanne-evans-suspended-disloyalty-nigel-farage\">suspended for six months</a> for alleged disloyalty.</p> <p>Also prevented from taking part in that election was Steven Woolfe, the initial favourite, who was barred after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/ukip-leadership-steven-woolfe-excluded-from-ballot\">filing his nomination papers 17 minutes late</a>.</p> <p>Woolfe has been at the centre of a tumultuous few weeks for Ukip, first admitting he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/steven-woolfe-admits-tory-talks-revives-ukip-leadership-bid\">considered joining the Conservatives</a>, before spending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/06/ukip-leadership-favourite-steven-woolfe-collapses-in-european-parliament\">three days in hospital</a> after an alleged scuffle with a MEP colleague, and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/17/ukip-mep-steven-woolfe-quits-party\">quitting the party</a>, saying it was in a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/18/ukip-deputy-leader-paul-nuttall-potential-unifier-leadership-contest-steven-woolfe-quits\">Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall seen as potential unifier amid turmoil</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Farage dismissed this comment, saying: \u201cHe talked about the downward spiral of Ukip and I\u2019m sorry to say it is the downward spiral of Steven Woolfe.\u201d</p> <p>Nuttall has stayed largely apart from the party\u2019s recent divisions, and said he was the only one who could bring it together. </p> <p>\u201cI have huge support out there across the country, not only among people at the top of the party, in Westminster and with the MEPs, but also among the grassroots,\u201d Nuttall said. \u201cI want to stand on a platform of being the unity candidate. Ukip needs to come together.\u201d</p> <p>The leadership campaign, for which voting among party members will open next month, is nonetheless likely to be a bruising one, given the already open warfare between Evans and Farage, and Banks\u2019s decision to back Kassam over Nuttall.<br></p> <p>Kassam, who also has a track record of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/10/ukip-insider-raheem-kassam-we-had-to-lock-hq-doors-because-some-people-were-too-embarrassing-to-be-seen\">falling out with fellow party members</a>, called Evans\u2019s description of him \u201csad\u201d. He said: \u201cThis is a project fear tactic and Ukippers are sick of these smears.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Scotland must be an \u201cequal partner\u201d in Brexit negotiations, the Holyrood government has told Theresa May, who is herself calling for a \u201cnew grown-up relationship\u201d before her crucial first meeting with the devolved administrations on Monday. </p> <p>The prime minister will host critical talks on the Brexit process with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for the first time since the UK voted to leave the European Union in June, at the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) on Monday.</p> <p>But before the meeting, the Scottish government\u2019s newly appointed minister for Brexit, Michael Russell, warned: \u201cThe prime minister has set the clock ticking and the UK government must use the time before triggering article 50 to engage properly with all the devolved administrations and show that they are willing and able to treat Scotland as an equal partner.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Continuing the war of words over who has a more substantial mandate regarding Scotland\u2019s relationship with the UK and Europe, he added: \u201cThe UK government needs to understand there is a triple mandate to maintain Scotland\u2019s relationship with, and place in, Europe.</p> <p>\u201cThe clearly expressed views of the people of Scotland, the democratically elected Scottish government and the Scottish parliament all need to be respected. But four months on from the referendum, we have yet to see a proposal from the UK government on how the views of people in Scotland will be taken into account.\u201d</p> <p>Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and May clashed over the question of mandate last week, after the SNP leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/20/second-scottish-independence-referendum-bill-published\">published a draft bill on a second independence referendum</a>. </p> <p>Sturgeon insisted that she had a clear mandate to hold a second vote because her party had been elected in May 2016 on a manifesto commitment to do so, should there be a \u201csignificant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will\u201d.</p> <p>However, a Number 10 spokesperson immediately dismissed the plan for a second vote, saying: \u201cThe prime minister and the government does not believe that there is a mandate for one. There was one only two years ago. There was an extremely high turnout and there was a resounding result in favour of Scotland remaining in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Sturgeon has also said that she will push for substantial additional powers for Holyrood as part of the UK\u2019s article 50 negotiations, including over international trade deals and immigration. </p> <p>This was again rebuffed by Westminster\u2019s Brexit secretary, David Davis, on a visit to Scotland on Friday, when he insisted that any arrangements to leave the EU would be a \u201cUnited Kingdom deal\u201d. </p> <p>Theresa May said she wanted to see a more mature relationship between her government and the devolved administrations, and will use Monday\u2019s talks to propose strengthening the JMC through annual meetings.</p> <p>\u201cI want Monday\u2019s meeting to be the start of a new grown-up relationship between the devolved administrations and the UK government \u2013 one in which we all work together to forge the future for everyone in the United Kingdom,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She is also expected to suggest making the JMC, which has not been held since December 2014, an annual event, hosted by each of the four governments on a revolving basis. She is to invite the leaders of the devolved administrations to take up a key role in building the UK\u2019s new industrial strategy. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>May\u2019s language was criticised by the former first minister Alex Salmond, who accused her of \u201cscolding\u201d Scotland.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Salmond <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14818243.Theresa_May_and_her_cabinet__planks_of_wood__are_hatcheted_ahead_of_Brexit_showdown_with_Nicola_Sturgeon/\">told the Sunday Herald</a>: \u201cWith her talk about a grown-up relationship, she needs to understand that she can\u2019t scold Scottish government ministers in the way she scolds her own departmental ministers.</p> <p>\u201cShe should not assume that the Scottish government is in the same state of confusion as her own government over Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Referring once again to the question of mandate, the SNP MP added: \u201cThe statement from Theresa May\u2019s spokesperson last week that Nicola Sturgeon does not have a mandate is one of the most absurd I\u2019ve ever heard in politics as it comes from a prime minister not elected by the public about a Scottish first minister who was overwhelmingly re-elected this year.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As I enter the hotel suite, Tom Ford stands in silhouette against an industrial, ceiling-height window, the light refracted behind him in a sunburst. It\u2019s an irresistible image, so perfect it almost had to be composed: both man and room shown off to their optimal effect. And, who am I kidding, it probably was. I had been checked at the door for a minute or two while Ford had rearranged some furniture that was irking him. Even a rented room, used for a day to plug a new movie, can be improved. Ford is obsessed with beautiful things and has had an enduring and hugely successful career, first in fashion, now as a film director, making people and places look their best.</p> <p>Ford strides towards me, eager, like a politician on the election trail, and extends his hand. I had read that he prefers to be called \u201cMr Ford\u201d and check if that\u2019s the case. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he smiles, as if it was one of the top five most ridiculous things he\u2019s ever heard. \u201cPleeease call me Tom.\u201d</p> <p>Tom Ford, the man, has always been the most compelling advertisement for Tom Ford, the creative output. He is, it\u2019s almost inane to note, a very handsome individual. These are looks that many would sell their souls for, but Ford, now an impossible 55 years old, hasn\u2019t needed to: just lots of vegetables and fish, no booze for years, tennis three times a week and an occasional restrained touch-up with Botox under the eyes and Just for Men dye on his beard stubble.</p> <p>Today, as he almost always does, Ford wears a cinched black suit, matching tie, a gold collar bar. \u201cA suit is armour,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not good in knitwear.\u201d His voice, almost a growl, is saturated with disdain. \u201cI feel mushy and soft. I\u2019m not good in anything but a boot. I feel solid and grounded. You gotta learn in life what makes you feel comfortable in terms of clothing and that\u2019s what you should wear. Some people look great in knitwear; that\u2019s what they want to wear, they look good in it, it feels right for them. Trainers: I feel weak in trainers. I mean, I wear them when I\u2019m at the gym, but I feel soft and I don\u2019t like that.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I actually had people say to me, \u2018My God, I didn\u2019t realise you had such depth.\u2019 It\u2019s kind of shocking</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How about when he was shooting his new film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/nocturnal-animals\"><em>Nocturnal Animals</em></a>, did Ford wear a suit then? \u201cYes, I wore it on set, it\u2019s a uniform. I\u2019m comfortable, it suits who I am,\u201d he replies. \u201cExcept the parts when we were in Texas, where I wore cowboy boots and a cowboy hat, which looks surprisingly good on me. Well, all of a sudden, 200 years of Texas pioneer background kind of genetically seems to just work on my head. And I don\u2019t look like a fool.\u201d</p> <p>Ford \u2013 I hope this is coming across \u2013 is surprisingly funny. He is completely serious and at the same time, nullifying the criticism often levelled at those in the fashion world, completely aware that some people will find what he\u2019s saying ridiculous. There are numerous stories-cum-urban-legends that have attached themselves to Ford over the years. That he takes five baths a day. That he doesn\u2019t like to see or smell food in his office. That he once sent an employee home for wearing three-quarter-length trousers. That he cannot abide hot drinks. That \u2013 this one courtesy of Victoria Beckham \u2013 he flies long haul in his suit and his only concession is to undo a single waistcoat button.</p> <p>Some people would regard him as eccentric, I say. \u201cEccentric?\u201d says Ford, visibly perking up, his hands carving arcs, like a matador\u2019s. \u201cOh, tell me about that!\u201d</p> <p>The multiple baths in a day. \u201cOh, I can explain that,\u201d he counters, a little disappointed perhaps that the rumour was not more outrageous. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s meditation. I take a bath in the morning, because the time I lie in the bathtub is when I work out all my problems. I think about the day, I think about what I\u2019ve got to do. I think about nothing, I clear my head. Same in the evening, before dinner, I can\u2019t go from work and out to a dinner and be good at a dinner \u2013 meaning be interesting and charming and be interested and listen to someone \u2013 unless I kind of wash away the day. The same at night, I can\u2019t go to sleep unless I get in the bathtub and again, wash away the day. So it\u2019s meditative for me, it\u2019s not that I have some cleanliness obsession.\u201d</p> <p>So that\u2019s cleared that up. \u201cI don\u2019t smoke,\u201d he goes on. \u201cSome people go out and have a cigarette. I don\u2019t drink, some people drink.\u201d He exhales theatrically. \u201cI lie in a bath full of hot water.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6553595738ebf7b1e3a6e5379442f2d1ffda0239\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6553595738ebf7b1e3a6e5379442f2d1ffda0239/0_384_3926_2355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Ford directs Amy Adams in Nocturnal Animals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018That very hard, lacquered, manufactured, glamorous life is part of the story\u2019: Tom Ford directs Amy Adams in the opening scenes of Nocturnal Animals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Merrick Morton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is common, as shown here, to fixate on Ford\u2019s aesthetic. This is, after all, how he made his name: he arrived, unheralded, as a designer at Gucci in 1990, when the company was on its knees; when he departed in 2004, it was one of the world\u2019s most desired luxury brands, owning Yves Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney, and valued at $10bn. In 2006, he started trading under his own name and there are now 122 Tom Ford stores, which take around $1bn each year in sales. Daniel Craig insists on Tom Ford suits for the Bond films, while Michelle Obama chose one of his gowns when she met the Queen.</p> <p>The idea, though, that he might be stronger on style than substance endured when Ford moved into film. His first feature, in 2010, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/14/a-single-man-film-review\"><em>A Single Man</em></a>, which followed a day in the life of a college professor, masterfully played by Colin Firth, who is contemplating suicide. It was a deeply assured debut and one that Ford was involved in every aspect of: as a writer \u2013 adapting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/20/100-best-novels-a-single-man-christopher-isherwood\">Christopher Isherwood\u2019s 1964 novel</a> \u2013 director and producer, plunging in some of his own savings, not all of which were returned at the box office. Still, many reviewers struggled to see past the lush cinematography and Firth\u2019s instantly iconic thick-rimmed spectacles. Peter Bradshaw in the <em>Guardian</em> wrote that it sometimes resembled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/11/a-single-man-review\">\u201ca 100-minute commercial for men\u2019s cologne: Bereavement by Dior\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Ford believes, with some justification, that there is a perception of him as an individual that precedes his films. \u201cI\u2019m a very, very, very private person,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m also a very shy person. So what most people know of me is a product. It is a billboard. It is a selling tool. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s false. It comes from me. Everything I make I am proud of. So this is a part of my personality, but it\u2019s the surface. When I made <em>A Single Man</em>, I actually had people say to me, \u2018My God, I didn\u2019t realise you had such depth.\u2019 It\u2019s kind of shocking. You realise, \u2018Oh, oh-kay\u2026\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His point is that the real Ford is more than the guy with perma-stubble who happens to look fantastic in aviators. \u201cI\u2019m glad that there is a large part of my character and my personality that is private,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t have a personal Instagram account, I\u2019m not photographing my dinner every night and sending it out to the world. I\u2019m quite private and the older I get the more I guard that, and the more famous I\u2019ve become, the more and more and more I guard that.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not just reviewers, either. When Ford approached Jake Gyllenhaal to star in <em>Nocturnal Animals</em>, the actor has admitted that he was concerned Ford, whom he didn\u2019t know at this point, would <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/tom-ford-designer-turned-director-925601\">\u201cfocus on the aesthetic over the heart of the story\u201d</a>. Gyllenhaal, however, was quickly convinced after speaking to the director, as was Amy Adams, who signed on to play the female lead, Susan, a privileged but unhappy gallery owner.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My son is going to grow up in a very privileged world, and I want to make sure that he\u2019s grounded</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI have to say, luckily most of the reviews of <em>Nocturnal Animals</em> have been terrific,\u201d notes Ford. \u201cBut the very few criticisms have been that\u2019s it\u2019s too beautiful, too stylised. I think if I didn\u2019t have another life as a fashion designer I wouldn\u2019t be hearing that and people wouldn\u2019t be judging that.</p> <p>\u201cNot comparing myself to Hitchcock,\u201d he continues, \u201cbut I\u2019ll use him as an example. He was notorious for spending weeks on his leading ladies\u2019 hair, makeup, look, clothes. What most directors do is intentional: how they frame something, whether it\u2019s composed or not composed is part of telling the story. In this particular case, that very hard, lacquered, manufactured, glamorous life is part of the story. It\u2019s key to understanding who Susan is and how she lives. It isn\u2019t just random because I wanted to see some beautiful clothes and beautiful hair and beautiful makeup. This is part of the story.\u201d</p> <p>That story is something of a departure for Ford, as well. <em>Nocturnal Animals </em> \u2013 a Grand Jury prize winner at Venice \u2013 which is adapted, again by Ford, from a 1993 novel called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/17/tony-and-susan-austin-wright\"><em>Tony and Susan</em></a> by Austin Wright, begins as very much a companion piece to <em>A Single Man</em>. Susan lives in a striking modernist house straight from the pages of <em>Wallpaper*</em>; her husband, Hutton (Armie Hammer), seems to smell of money, but they clearly don\u2019t much like each other. Susan has even inherited Colin Firth\u2019s signature glasses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc1109f1912a8de1a3f8c8d23833f756168b9b95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc1109f1912a8de1a3f8c8d23833f756168b9b95/717_21_1958_1176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Firth in Tom Ford\u2019s acclaimed directorial debut, A Single Man (2009), based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Isherwood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colin Firth in Tom Ford\u2019s acclaimed directorial debut, A Single Man (2009), based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Isherwood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everything changes, though, when Susan receives a package from her first husband, Edward (Gyllenhaal), whom she hasn\u2019t seen in years: it\u2019s a novel he\u2019s written, dedicated to her; a brutal page-turner about a family travelling across the Texas desert who find themselves in an altercation with a gang of young droogs. <em>Nocturnal Animals</em> now starts flicking between Susan\u2019s sedate, joyless life in Los Angeles and a pulse-racing crime thriller that plays out in her head as she reads Edward\u2019s book. Ford ultimately intertwines these stories into one suffocatingly intense narrative and makes powerful, sometimes stinging comments on the importance of loyalty, the thrill of revenge and the perils of consumerism.</p> <p>Yes, you read that straight: Tom Ford is railing against the perils of consumerism. A man whose eponymous fashion label sells an oversize Dakota bag for $6,450 (\u00a35,250) and whose suits for men all cost in excess of $5,000 (\u00a34,100). A man who owns a house in Bel Air designed by Richard Neutra, an 1827 John Nash Mayfair townhouse and a ranch in New Mexico, on land larger than Manhattan, with Tadao Ando buildings and an airstrip, which was recently put on the market for \u00a360m. But Ford is no fool and well aware of the extreme potential for hypocrisy.</p> <p>\u201cThe character of Susan is quite autobiographical; in some ways, she was a female version of me,\u201d Ford admits. \u201cFortunate or not, I live in that world that Susan lives in. I know those people. A few years ago now, I really had a midlife crisis. I think a lot of my younger years \u2013 and a lot of people\u2019s younger years, I bet \u2013 are spent achieving whatever it is, when you\u2019re young, you think you need to do. Getting ahead in your career, getting this, getting that, buying your first apartment, getting married and then you realise, \u2018OK, well I\u2019ve done all that, now what? Is this what there is?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>A low point came when he acrimoniously left Gucci: his drinking got out of control, he became depressed. \u201cA lot of people keep it in check. I didn\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t mean you want to give up those material things, but it means you need to keep a balance and so yeah, I\u2019ve struggled with that. And I\u2019ve struggled with contemporary culture. Sometimes, contemporary culture revolts me. And where we\u2019re moving, it just disgusts me.\u201d</p> <p>Ford shakes his head. He\u2019s aware he\u2019s asking questions and not supplying too many answers. \u201cWe\u2019re culturally taught now that there\u2019s this thing called happiness that\u2019s achievable,\u201d he sighs. Where we\u2019re just happy because we\u2019ve done this and that, we\u2019ve gotten there, we\u2019ve bought this house and we\u2019ve got these kids and we\u2019re just happy now. That\u2019s a relatively new idea. Because happiness doesn\u2019t exist. A happy morning exists and then maybe a depressing lunch and a bad afternoon and maybe a nice evening. We\u2019re sold this concept and I realise that I\u2019m one of the people that\u2019s helping do this because I\u2019m responsible also for our contemporary consumer culture.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a47b25361ca78b8590da8319fe939966cb5eff2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a47b25361ca78b8590da8319fe939966cb5eff2/0_0_3209_4012/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Ford on the set of Nocturnal Animals.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Ford on the set of Nocturnal Animals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Merrick Morton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ford grew up middle class in middle America, first in Texas, then New Mexico from the age of 11; his parents were real-estate agents. From as early as he can remember, Ford had a singular fascination with style. He often chose to wear a suit as a child and was mercilessly bullied at school for carrying a briefcase. \u201cActually, it was an attache case,\u201d he corrects. \u201cBut that\u2019s true, they were really mean to me. I look back at pictures of myself in a little raincoat and briefcase and I just think, \u2018Oh God\u2026\u2019 But that was me and my parents just let me express who I was, which was also great.\u201d</p> <p>Again you get the impression, though he might deny it, that Ford has never been bothered by being regarded as eccentric. \u201cI have a sister, she didn\u2019t dress like that at all,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s not remotely interested in fashion, she\u2019s an English teacher. She could have all the Tom Ford clothes she wants; she doesn\u2019t care. She\u2019s quite beautiful but she\u2019s never been into fashion. My mother is, however, and my grandmother was to the nth degree. So I had women around me who were. I don\u2019t think I ever saw my mother without her makeup as a child. Ever. But that\u2019s a very Texas thing. My first scent memories were hairspray \u2013 it was the early 1960s, I was sitting on the floor playing while she was getting dressed.\u201d</p> <p>Ford has been reflecting on his early years more since he\u2019s become a parent himself. Jack was born four years ago, reportedly by in-vitro fertilisation and a surrogate, to Ford and Richard Buckley, a fashion writer and his partner of 30 years. \u201cHe\u2019s going to grow up in a very privileged world and I want to make sure that he\u2019s grounded,\u201d says Ford, who, after 25 years living in Europe, mainly London, recently moved his primary residence to Los Angeles (\u201cAll of a sudden I needed some sun. I did!\u201d). \u201cSo a big consideration is to try to raise him in a very natural, non-elitist way.\u201d</p> <p>Jack\u2019s arrival, Ford believes, has made him perhaps a fraction less uptight; he\u2019d hoped that Jack would play with tasteful, grey wooden toys, but his stark, beautiful houses are now defiled by lurid plastic. \u201cAt the end of the day, he always tells me about his day and I tell him about my day and Richard talks about his day,\u201d says Ford. \u201cThe other night, Jack says, \u2018Well, how was your day? You look sad.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, it was a tough day.\u2019 Then he said, \u2018You know, you say that every night.\u2019 And I said, \u2018I do?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yeah. So what are you going to do about that?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Wow, what am I going to do about that?\u2019 Their observations are so simple and so clear: \u2018Well, you\u2019re sad, you need to do something about that.\u2019 It\u2019s very interesting. Then I felt guilty and terrible: \u2018Oh God, I\u2019m going home every day and seeming sad and I should be really there for him.\u2019 But you know, just the daily stresses of businesses sometimes get to you.\u201d</p> <p>Films make Ford happy, he insists, but he still retains a stubborn streak of melancholy. \u201cWorking, for me, keeps me distracted and keeps me from pondering the ultimate end to all of this, which is the same for all of us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to let go of it all, we have to say goodbye to everything. That doesn\u2019t terrify me, but I\u2019m aware of it every second. And I think it\u2019s one of the things that makes me appreciate things, because you realise this isn\u2019t going to last, so I need to look at it, I need to experience it, I need to try to drink it in. Beauty I find so sad. There\u2019s nothing sadder to me than true, true beauty because it is so temporary and so transient, so somehow you\u2019ve got to embrace that aspect of it.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he concludes, \u201cI sound like a crazy person. I guess I\u2019m quite philosophical and I spend an enormous amount of time pondering all of these things \u2013 in the bath. In the bath!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bddb3e01b6acec1d94093270526331a8ec0267ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bddb3e01b6acec1d94093270526331a8ec0267ec/0_0_4163_2499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ford walks the runway during his London fashion week show at Lindley Hall, February 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ford walks the runway during his London fashion week show at Lindley Hall, February 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samir Hussein/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seeing as much of modern culture, as he says, \u201cdisgusts\u201d him, does Ford ever worry about the world that Jack will grow up in? \u201cI think every generation feels that,\u201d he replies. \u201cYou go back and read something 100 years old and that\u2019s what adults are talking about. For them, it will be their world. And some day Kim Kardashian is probably going to be on some stage at Kennedy Center Honors [annual awards given to a handful of artists judged to have made a meaningful contribution to American culture] when she\u2019s 80, getting an award.\u201d Ford claps, perhaps sarcastically. \u201cAnd everyone\u2019s going to say, \u2018Oh my God, Kim Kardashian, don\u2019t you remember when she was\u2026\u2019\u201d She will be their Marilyn. She will be there because this is the world we live in.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s been seven years since <em>A Single Man</em>, but Ford has been keeping busy. He wanted to devote proper time to raising his son. Meanwhile, the fashion juggernaut rolls on, requiring a new collection for men and women twice a year. There were false starts, too, before he settled on <em>Nocturnal Animals</em> as the script to pursue. \u201cThere\u2019s been work. Thought. And things I turned down.\u201d He laughs. \u201cAnd two screenplays I wrote that are not so good and I wouldn\u2019t make.\u201d</p> <p>Ford continues to love clothes and he\u2019s proud of the enduring popularity of Tom Ford, but it\u2019s hard not to feel that he has little left to prove in that world. He pretty well admits as much. \u201cThere\u2019s a moment in fashion when you think of the idea,\u201d he says. \u201cYou think, \u2018Oh God, fuck, that\u2019s it!\u2019 And a lot of times you\u2019re wrong and it doesn\u2019t work at all, but that moment when you think it does is great. But fashion is very fleeting. You can look at that same thing the next year and you\u2019re like, \u2018OK, yeah that\u2019s nice.\u2019 And you look at it years later in a museum and you go, \u2018Well, that\u2019s interesting, look at how I did that stitching, that was great.\u2019 But it never has the power that it does at the very beginning.</p> <p>\u201cAnd film does,\u201d he continues. \u201cYou watch an old film, everyone\u2019s dead but you\u2019re crying with them, you\u2019re emoting with them; it\u2019s the most rewarding thing if you\u2019re someone who wants to express themselves. It\u2019s the most permanent thing I think that we have. Even painting. Let\u2019s take abstract expressionism. The very first time people saw an abstract painting it would have been shocking. Today, it\u2019s modern vocabulary, we see it everywhere, it can\u2019t have the [same] power. Film doesn\u2019t do that. Film, if it\u2019s not something that\u2019s easily dated, if it\u2019s genuine, has the same power when you watch it 30 years, 40 years, 80 years later. It\u2019s not diluted. And that\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a stubborn sniffiness about a fashion designer making films, but the process is remarkably similar, Ford has found. Both require a strong vision, something to say and the ability to command an army of hired hands, working them hard without demoralising them, inspiring them to bring to life what you have in your head. Both activities also suit an obsessive, single-minded temperament. It\u2019s easy to mock the idea of Ford luxuriating in three baths a day, but he wakes at 4.30am, barely sleeps and can subsist for days on just iced coffee and Oreo Thins.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2450213a01e622115bae3d89723e634f4124f9f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2450213a01e622115bae3d89723e634f4124f9f3/0_0_3285_1971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jake Gyllenhaal as Tony Hastings in Nocturnal Animals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jake Gyllenhaal as Tony Hastings in Nocturnal Animals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ford has also brought a mastery of the eye-catching stunt to both fields, often involving nudity. One advertisement for Gucci, shot by Mario Testino, featuring a female model pulling down her pants to show a G shaved in her pubic hair. Sophie Dahl sprawled libidinously on a silk sheet for Opium by Yves Saint Laurent, meanwhile, found its way on to the Advertising Standards Agency\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18243577\">\u201cTop 10 Most Complained About Ads\u201d</a> list. Ford, though, has always considered himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/mar/21/tom-ford-im-an-equal-opportunity-objectifier\">\u201can equal-opportunity objectifier\u201d</a> and in 2002 he showed a male martial artist full frontal in an ad for YSL\u2019s M7 fragrance.</p> <p>The opening scenes of <em>Nocturnal Animals</em> have been causing a similar fuss at film festivals. It depicts a montage of full-figured, not-young women dancing naked in slow motion. They are accessorised with bits and pieces of Americana while glitter tumbles around them. Eventually, the viewer clicks that it is in fact a video art piece that is being projected in Susan\u2019s gallery. So Tom Ford, what were you\u2026</p> <p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d he interjects. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p> <p>Exactly. \u201cWhen I was young I had a poster of Farrah Fawcett in a red bikini, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen, with the big teeth and hair, and I think that was a lot of people\u2019s idea of America: the land of tans, beauty and youth,\u201d Ford explains. \u201cAnd I decided that today, perhaps, to the outside world America looks gluttonous, overfed, ageing, sagging, decrepit. So I shot that and I had the most fun day making that. These women were so happy to be there, they were so free, they were just liberated, they were spectacular. I fell in love with them. And I realised that actually they were the opposite of Susan: they were joyful because they had let go of what they were supposed to be and they were just themselves. Whether you like them or hate them and think they are fat or not fat, they were themselves. And they were comfortable with that. So that became the opening art sequence.\u201d</p> <p>Ford has clearly thought about his defence, marshalled his arguments, but he can\u2019t help a mischievous aside. \u201cFrom a practical standpoint and a theatrical standpoint, it also pulls you right into the film from the beginning,\u201d he says. \u201cGets your attention and that\u2019s important. And then you\u2019re like, \u2018Where\u2019s this going?\u2019 And you\u2019re watching.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n750DzGzG0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5n750DzGzG0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n750DzGzG0\">Watch the trailer for Nocturnal Animals.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><em>Nocturnal Animals</em> is likely to surprise many people: it is smarter, more visceral, more thought-provoking than doubters would have expected from Tom Ford, while still being just as beguiling to look at. He draws compelling, award-worthy performances from Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon, as a nihilistic Texas policeman charged with tracking down the thugs. It is a terrific film that stirs and aggressively challenges the head, eyes and heart.</p> <p>Ford vows that it won\u2019t be seven years before he has a new movie project; he\u2019ll never be prolific, partly because he wants to be involved in every stage of the process, but three years is more like it. What about children, would he like more? \u201cOriginally, I thought yes; however now I think no,\u201d he says. \u201cI love Jack, we\u2019re a great family, we\u2019re very happy, the three of us. I\u2019m not a young dad, Richard\u2019s an even older dad. If I pick Jack up out of the bathtub and he wiggles the wrong way, it throws my back out. I think there\u2019s a reason why people have children when they\u2019re in their 20s and 30s! So no, we\u2019re really happy as a family as we are.\u201d</p> <p>This is perhaps the most shocking moment of the interview: Ford, a man who seems personally to defy the progress of time, acknowledges that he is getting older. As we wrap up our conversation, I ask him if he\u2019s just a bit terrified about ageing. \u201cI think it\u2019s time I started ageing, otherwise I\u2019ll start looking odd,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to give in to it. I mind the physical part that comes with it, but the actual mindset that comes with it, I love. Because while I don\u2019t like it, I also don\u2019t care as much. So what? This is who I am.\u201d</p> <p>What about letting himself go grey? He looks at me sternly, then a little hurt. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m grey?!\u201d Then his voice rumbles like a muscle car revving its engine: \u201cOh no, I\u2019ve planned on going grey. I know exactly when I\u2019ll go grey. I have a four\u2011year-old child, there\u2019s lots of time to go grey. I plan on living into my 90s, so maybe 72, 73, 74, I\u2019ll go grey. Then I\u2019ll have a good 20 years of grey.\u201d A stickler for good manners, he walks me to the door of the suite. \u201cThat\u2019s plenty.\u201d</p> <p><em>Nocturnal Animals is out on 4 November</em></p>",

  "<p>If we are living in an age of loneliness, Angel Olsen might just be the perfect voice for its soundtrack. The American singer-songwriter first emerged six years ago as a backing singer for the alt-country overlord Bonnie Prince Billy, but over the course of two solo albums has proved her mettle as a darkly emotional, spectral-voiced folk troubadour.</p> <p>Her acclaimed second record, 2014\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/16/burn-fire-no-witness-angel-olsen-review\"><em>Burn Your Fire for No Witness</em></a>, expanded her sound from crackly 40s vinyl to a more full-blooded indie rock attack, with her powerful voice and acutely honest lyrics about the pain of loss and the hard-won consolations of remaining true to yourself winning her a devoted legion of fans. She also came with a satisfyingly out-of-the-ordinary backstory; adopted at the age of three, Olsen grew up in St Louis, Missouri, with middle-aged parents and seven siblings much older than herself, giving her both a fascination with music from the past and a kind of observational otherness, a sense of looking at other people\u2019s lives from a distance. Although only 29, if you only listened to her records, you would imagine a world-weary singer with decades of heartbreak and philosophising under her belt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/16/burn-fire-no-witness-angel-olsen-review\">Angel Olsen: Burn Your Fire For No Witness \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But with the release last month of her fabulous third album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/04/angel-olsen-my-woman-review-shut-up-kiss-me\"><em>My Woman</em></a>, Olsen is kicking against all the lonesome country girl boxes she seemed to fall into so easily. Recording with an expanded backing band, she has introduced retro-style <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/15/stranger-things-review-a-shot-of-80s-nostalgia-right-to-your-heart-winona-ryder\"><em>Stranger Things</em></a> synths and 70s AOR wig-outs to her palette, and appeared in self-directed videos <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nleRCBhLr3k\">wearing a sparkly silver wig</a> and hammily rollerskating around in a playsuit. Adding to the alt-country sacrilege, she has employed the help of producer Justin Raisen, who has shaped the punky pop attitude of Charli XCX and Sky Ferreira. It is hardly Dylan going electric, but nonetheless Olsen seems to have spent much of the promotional round of interviews for the album\u2019s release railing against accusations that the queen of sad has gone shamelessly for the pop jugular.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some of Olsen\u2019s rapt audience are, slightly terrifyingly, mouthing her lyrics silently back at her</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What Olsen does seem to want is to challenge her audience rather than simply make them swoon. Before she comes on stage, the spotlights swoop in arcs, a showbiz staple that suggests an old-school soul revue is about to spring into life. Her five-piece backing band emerge dapperly dressed in matching grey suits and western bolo ties, against which Olsen, in a green, high-necked jumper and ankle-length skirt, with her hair piled messily on top of head, looks like she has come straight from the British Library. While the audience simmers in the pits, Olsen remains so cool that even swathed in winter woollens and clutching her guitar she never breaks into a sweat.</p> <p>Not that there is anything underpowered about her performance. While she barely moves, her eyes fixed ahead in a poker-faced glare, she sings with incredible power, the notes soaring and dropping like an autumn wind. Olsen has a voice that reveals itself like a Russian doll: a soft, girlish whisper giving way to a stentorian roar, which in turn lifts into a soprano\u2019s roof-raising cry. The highlight of this, and of <em>My Woman</em>, is the gorgeous <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mIA1r2ZELU\">Sister</a>, where Olsen\u2019s voice morphs from Hope Sandoval\u2019s tender drawl to a Stevie Nicks-style swaying incantation of \u201cAll my life, I thought I\u2019d change\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nleRCBhLr3k\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nleRCBhLr3k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nleRCBhLr3k\">Watch Angel Olsen\u2019s Shut Up Kiss Me video.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It is such a versatile, commandingly theatrical voice, it\u2019s a shame that the trills and slurs on her notes sometimes obscure her fantastic lyrics, and especially her humour. Yes, the word lonely pops up within two songs, a direct lift of Hank Williams\u2019s I\u2019m So Lonesome, I Could Cry in the opening to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL_3Y4zNnqg\">Hi-Five</a>, but Olsen also has a sharp way with a funny rhyming couplet. She sounds like Katharine Hepburn when she drops the best deadpan line of the year so far on Intern: \u201cI don\u2019t care what the papers say/ It\u2019s just another intern with a resum\u00e9.\u201d</p> <p>Not that there is much laughing or even moving from her rapt audience, some of whom are, slightly terrifyingly, mouthing her lyrics silently back at her. Which is a shame, as she has plenty of grooves and head-shaking guitar licks, meatily powered out by her backing band. Olsen tries to break the ice with a few drawling jokes, but she can\u2019t cut through the awe until the encore when, turning side-on to her keyboard, she sings: \u201cI dare you to understand what makes me a woman.\u201d You have to conclude: talent to burn.</p>",
  "<p>The subject has become a key issue in the Brexit debate: who gets in and who has to stay out.

We are exporting mango chutney to India!\u201d</p> <p>He is worried about the impact of the immigration controls on the curry house. \u201cAlready we have a skill shortage, nobody wants to work in the kitchens, not just the Indian restaurant but the top hotels too where half the staff is European or Indian. People want to come and make some money working hard and then go, and we need that contribution. This is a great country but if people are not allowed to come, we will lose a lot from their contribution.

The exercise is expected to be repeated on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p> <p>It is the endgame for a site that has increasingly become the toxic symbol of Europe\u2019s migrant crisis and the subject of rancorous debate among French politicians and the British media.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/17/refugees-hope-and-despair-in-calais-camp-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/57q8c\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2814168\"            data-video-name=\"Refugees' hope and despair in Calais camp \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58049584e4b047a4eaafd52d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/17/161117CalaisTensions2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/17/161117CalaisTensions2_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/17/161117CalaisTensions2.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/17/refugees-hope-and-despair-in-calais-camp-video\">Refugees\u2019 hope and despair in Calais camp</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Inside the camp itself, the countdown to clearance has prompted panic. On Saturday charities were frantically handing out secondhand suitcases to families, disseminating advice on what to do when the dreaded columns of the Compagnies R\u00e9publicaines de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u2013 the riot police \u2013 converge on the camp.</p> <p>Some are not prepared to find out. \u201cA few boys left yesterday, they asked if I wanted to go,\u201d said Abdul Shahnawaz, 16, from Musa Qala, Helmand province, Afghanistan, who has lived in the camp since March. Did they say where? \u201cThat way,\u201d said Abdul, pointing towards Belgium.</p> <p>Of the huge numbers of children who have stayed, many remain bewildered. Outside the Refugee Youth Service, a large crowd was following a boisterous football game featuring child refugees. Among them stood a group of five teenagers, aged between 15 and 17, from the troubled Sudanese region of Darfur, who had met each other in the camp.</p> <p>All were eligible to come to Britain: some had relatives in the UK, others qualified under a separate government scheme to help unaccompanied minors stranded on the continent. All had heard the rumours, the swirl of gossip and half-truths, that has electrified the camp with fresh uncertainty.</p> <p>Less than 48 hours before the demolition was due to begin, none of the Darfur children seemed convinced the camp would close.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been told nothing, but I don\u2019t want to go anywhere \u2013 only the UK,\u201d said Ahmed, 15. His friend, Walid, 16, pointed to the tree line that marks the southern perimeter of Europe\u2019s largest shanty town \u2013 the camp is not officially recognised by the French authorities \u2013 and admitted he was contemplating hiding in the woods when the police arrived. Abrahim, 16, said that some children had discussed fleeing to Paris.</p> <p>Another member of the group, Rashif, 17, refused to countenance that the refugee town he had called home since February would be destroyed. He gestured towards the camp\u2019s main strip, lined with Afghan, Sudanese and Persian restaurants and grocers \u2013 already bustling mid-morning \u2013 and shook his head. His friend, Ahmed, 16, did not know what to believe, saying that the increasingly persistent rumour that the camp was definitely closing might prove another false alarm.</p> <p>\u201cWe are always hearing that the camp will go,\u201d he said, before describing his journey from the conflict of west Sudan to northern France \u2013 a trip that began when he was aged 14 and involved 12 months in Tripoli, Libya, where he was forced to make bread at gunpoint for a militia group.</p> <p>As the day wore on, word spread that the camp\u2019s vast population of unaccompanied minors would not be forced on to the buses. Instead, they would be temporarily rehoused in the converted white shipping containers that the French government built on the site as accommodation blocks in March. Here, it is hoped that the claims of hundreds of children as young as 10 who are eligible for UK entry will be processed in relative safety.</p> <p>The fact that details of the container resettlement emerged late on Friday is indicative of the Britain\u2019s approach to the crisis. Charities, volunteer groups and aid agencies believe Theresa May\u2019s government was doggedly against taking significant numbers of child refugees from Calais and only when it became politically expedient did it acquiesce. All the evidence suggests that the Home Office began prioritising the issue only a few days before the camp\u2019s scheduled demolition.</p> <p>About 60 eligible children arrived in the UK from northern France last week. Ten times that number are thought to remain in the camp.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been campaigning for a year for the UK government to help the children in Calais and then they try and do it all in a week, which obviously they couldn\u2019t,\u201d said Josie Naughton of the charity Help Refugees.</p> <p>The Lib Dem peer Baroness Sheehan, who visited the camp on Friday, said: \u201cI have absolutely no idea what the Home Office have been doing. It\u2019s been an absolute, utter shambles, completely chaotic. The recent arrivals are a damage limitation exercise.\u201d</p> <p>She, along with 18 aid and refugee organisations and another 120 MPs and peers, is among the signatories of a letter to the home secretary, Amber Rudd, that declares they would \u201cnot tolerate a situation whereby demolition of the camp will make the children even more vulnerable\u201d.</p> <p>Yet those youngsters who did make it to Britain last week also revealed that the Home Office is operating in a climate where a toxic discourse around even child refugees has seeped into the mainstream. In addition, last week\u2019s call by Conservative backbenchers to introduce dental x-ray checks to verify the age of child refugees continues to shock volunteers in the camp. \u201cWhere has the humanity gone?\u201d said Lally Mergler of the camp\u2019s unofficial women and children\u2019s centre.</p> <p>Similarly, the accusation that some of the arrivals were adults pretending to be children because they appeared older than 18 has also horrified those who can testify that the stress, living conditions and hardship of their journeys can rapidly age adolescents\u2019 features.</p> <p>The key point, say volunteers, is that the process to gain entry into the UK is extensive and bureaucratic, typically involving 10 hours of legal work for each child just on verification.</p> <p>\u201cThe children have to provide documentation, evidence. The Home Office process is extremely rigorous: it is mendacious to claim otherwise,\u201d said Naughton. The claim that only males were being allowed into the UK is also wrong. At least one Eritrean girl arrived last week.</p> <p>Before the buses start arriving on Monday, the authorities and volunteers are also working to make sure the cohort of refugees suffering mental health issues are looked after. \u201cThere are going to be many families, vulnerable people, people with mental health issues, that need looking after,\u201d said Sheehan.</p> <p>Dan de Maine, who works with Help Refugees\u2019 vulnerabilities team, said he hoped that three profoundly deaf Sudanese men \u2013 Mohammed, 17, Hamid, 23, and Mostafa, 20 \u2013 would be among those awarded a new life in Britain. Last week the Home Office took their details for consideration. \u201cBy registering them we have effectively kept them here hoping, waiting and praying as the demolition crews and riot police ready themselves,\u201d said de Maine.</p> <p>Despite the tension generated by the impending demolition, one remarkable trait of the camp endures \u2013 the general friendliness of its children. Even on Saturday, groups smiled as they shared jokes or calmly queued by themselves for food.</p> <p>Andy Elvin, chief executive of Tact, the UK\u2019s largest fostering and adoption charity with more than 500 carers, is not surprised. Feedback he receives shows that unaccompanied minors are the favourite type of children among their foster parents. \u201cThey are thoughtful, kind, respectful and extremely keen to learn. They have a relativity that makes them appreciate life. Most foster parents say they are an absolute joy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Many hope the joy is shared more widely and that the UK keeps promises to help the refugee children of Calais.</p> <h2>STORY OF \u2018THE JUNGLE\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Christmas Day 2001 </strong></p> <p>Eurotunnel, which said it was stopping 200 refugees each night from smuggling themselves into Britain, is stormed by 500 people who break through security barriers but fail to reach England.</p> <p><strong>December 2002</strong></p> <p>Sangatte refugee camp \u2013 opened in 1999 by the Red Cross in a warehouse to shelter 600 people who had been sleeping rough around the port \u2013 is closed after the UK agreed to give temporary work permits to accept 1,250 Kurds and Afghans, while France gave residency to 400.</p> <p><strong>April 2009 </strong></p> <p>French police arrest 190 at one of the small, outdoor camps that have sprung up since 2002 and the site is bulldozed.</p> <p><strong>September 2009</strong></p> <p>A raid is staged to bulldoze another camp and 276 are arrested.</p> <p><strong>July 2014 </strong></p> <p>French police again raid a \u201cjungle\u201d camp.

When she\u2019s not doing that, you\u2019ve probably seen her on telly as a science presenter for the BBC.

Whether it\u2019s a politician or a salesman, you need to know the rules they\u2019re playing by. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to be an expert on weather systems or on double glazing or cars or mattresses or phones, but if you know the basics it gives you the confidence to ask the right questions. Say someone is trying to sell you a swanky smartphone case to make your reception better, or a magnetic bracelet they say will cure your wrist pain, you can ask \u201cwell, how does it work?\u201d and if you know the basics you can tell whether they know what they are talking about or whether they\u2019re just making things up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c97401bf93cd3d4cadee8e8aad0a0be1b6d20df2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c97401bf93cd3d4cadee8e8aad0a0be1b6d20df2/156_0_1570_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A satellite image of the arctic shows comparative ice melt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A satellite image of the Arctic shows comparative ice melt: an opportunity for bubble research, says Czerski.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>But a lot of people shun physics because it seems so complicated and irrelevant.</strong><br>I know.

People get the impression that it\u2019s all about quantum weirdness or stars and time and the universe, but it\u2019s also about quite basic things. Physics is about patterns that are folded into our everyday lives. It\u2019s much more accessible than people think and we should be telling them that.

How about the way that tea sloshes around when you walk helping to explain why mobile phone signals don\u2019t interfere with each other? Tea sloshes at different rates in different size mugs, faster in little mugs and slower in bigger ones. The reason you spill tea when you walk is that it just so happens that the walking speed of a normal human is almost exactly the same as the slopping speed in your average mug. The walking speed exactly reinforces the slopping speed, so you spill the tea if you walk normally \u2013 walk slowly or with a tiny mug or a gigantic mug and you won\u2019t spill a drop. Mobile phone signals work on the same principle. They\u2019ve each got a really precisely tuned resonance \u2013 or electron slopping rate \u2013 so that you can have two people sitting next to each other on two phones having two different conversations and they won\u2019t interfere with each other.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I see choosing to have an adventure as a rational decision, even though it might look irrational</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Is there a tension between being a scientist and being a television presenter?</strong><br>The biggest tension is time. It\u2019s definitely more than one job, however you want to add it up. There are benefits: I learn a lot. I\u2019ve definitely met people and learned things that I otherwise wouldn\u2019t have if I stayed in my lab like a lot of scientists do. There are similarities between the two, too. The most important thing, whether it\u2019s doing scientific research or presenting or writing, is understanding the situation clearly enough to be able to pick out exactly the right question. To organise all the ideas into a hierarchy and say: \u201cThis [jabs at an imaginary point with her finger], this is the important thing that it all hangs on.\u201d</p> <p><strong>It must be tough to make time for yourself?</strong><br>Not really. I manage to do some kind of sport \u2013 badminton or running or canoeing \u2013 almost every day. One of the things that I find mystifying is that people tend to think of scientists as somehow \u201cother\u201d, somehow alien. I\u2019ve sometimes not been invited to normal, mundane things that I\u2019d enjoy because people assume I\u2019m off doing something higher.

I was too shy to speak as a child and it\u2019s something I only really began to overcome around the time of my PhD [in experimental explosives physics at the University of Cambridge]. Academically, I\u2019m probably most proud of building instruments that go out into the open ocean and measure things that we have never been able to measure before.

  "<p>It is a strangely embarrassing time to be a man. You only have to watch the news, or log on to Twitter, or just open your eyes, and you will see a man doing something atrocious. Very often the man we see is Donald Trump, but Trump is just the most visible example of the toxic masculinity on offer. It is there, in some form or other, all over our virtual and actual reality.</p> <p>Of course, men have always done terrible things. You could pinpoint any moment in history and men would have been doing something despicable. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2011/jun/27/cambodia-khmer-rouge-trial-video\" title=\"\">Pol Pot</a> and Hitler and Stalin were men, for instance. So was Jack the Ripper. So is, indisputably, Donald Trump.</p> <p>And, away from the big names, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/04/grayson-perry-dress-tranny-art-who-are-you-tv\" title=\"\">Grayson Perry</a> puts it in his new book on masculinity, \u201cmost violent people, rapists, criminals, killers, tax avoiders, corrupt politicians, planet despoilers, sex abusers and dinner-party bores, do tend to be, well\u2026 men\u201d. This has always been the case, in every patriarchal society in history. But the difference nowadays is that we are beginning to understand that part of the problem with men is not their gender but rather the gender role dictated to them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He points to a more tender model of manhood, embodied by Barack Obama and David Beckham</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For decades now, female writers and theorists have been dismantling their biological gender from the perceived feminine roles that can restrict or harm their lives. It is only recently that we have started to do this with men too, to see a man as distinct from the concept and construct of masculinity. Maybe one of the reasons for this is that we have a tendency to regard men as the normal human state of things. Society is shaped by men, literally, in the sense that town planners and architects have traditionally been male (an issue that Perry touches on, looking at how public toilets and even air conditioning are geared towards male comfort levels) and so we aren\u2019t trained to notice them. Us. Men just <em>are</em>.</p> <p>Perry claims this is also one of the reasons why men dress how they do. The grey business suit, for instance. \u201cA primary function of their sober attire is not just to look smart,\u201d he notes, \u201cbut to be invisible\u2026 the business suit is the uniform of those who do the looking, the appraising. It rebuffs comment by its sheer ubiquity.\u201d</p> <p>Life as performance is not a new idea. As the melancholic Jaques famously tells us in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/video/2016/may/03/zawe-ashton-jacques-as-you-like-it-all-the-worlds-a-stage-shakespeare-video\" title=\"\">Act II of <em>As You Like It</em></a>: \u201cAll the world\u2019s a stage, And all the men and women merely players.\u201d Merely players, maybe, but performing different roles. Perry himself is arguably the perfect person to write about masculinity, as he is not only a man \u2013 \u201ca white man, a rather tarnished badge to wear these days, weighted with guilt and shame at the behaviour of one\u2019s fellows\u201d \u2013 but also a man who, along with those early Shakespearean actors, likes to wear women\u2019s clothes from time to time.</p> <p>One of the strongest areas of the book is here, on the topic of clothing. He reminds us of the codes we often follow, without thinking too deeply about them; how men often dress functionally for work, while women\u2019s attire is expected to be more frivolous and decorative, one big \u201cextraneous addition\u201d tacked on to the male status quo. But Perry admits that wearing women\u2019s clothes doesn\u2019t give him special immunity from the masculine role. The reason he can see the perils of masculinity, despite being a self-confessed sissy, is because he is familiar with those roles, has known many of them himself \u2013 \u201cif you spot it, you\u2019ve got it\u201d. In two lovely biographical anecdotes (of which there&#xa0;are many), he writes about how he used to be horrified as a child whenever he had to&#xa0;eat his cereal out of a bowl with a floral pattern and he would slowly see the flowers appear as the milk went down; and of the thrill he got from watching violent movies on television and then talking about them the next day with his school friends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"307cdd81a66ebf84d919c719fa52fe61623e26b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/307cdd81a66ebf84d919c719fa52fe61623e26b9/0_0_3064_3527/869.jpg\" alt=\"Grayson Perry\" width=\"869\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There\u2019s a slight contradiction about a man in the public eye calling for men to shy away from public life.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/descent-of-man-434428.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Descent of Man</em></a>, as with Perry\u2019s TV series <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/grayson-perry-all-man\" title=\"\"><em>All Man</em></a> on which this book frequently draws, may be an attack on certain aspects of masculinity, it is not an attack on men. Perry rightly acknowledges that masculine values, such as stoic self-sufficiency, can be chronically damaging to men, and can harm their relationships with their partners and with themselves.</p> <p>Indeed, with suicide now the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/22/suicide-rate-middle-age-men-mental-health-up-73-per-cent\" title=\"\">leading cause of death</a> for men under the age of 50, this is an urgent issue. Men need to do more speaking out and less manning up. Yet because we see men as the default setting, the risk is that we see their problems as the natural order of things. Men may reap many economic and&#xa0;social benefits from adopting the cloak of masculinity, but their self-imposed emotional sphere might be claustrophobic for some. \u201cOld-school men\u201d can feel a failure simply by asking for help.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Maybe there is room for all kinds of masculinity, including tough guys, as long as everyone is kind to each other</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The solution, according to this book, is not to abandon masculinity altogether, but to shift it a little. He points to a new model of manhood, a more tender model, embodied by Barack Obama and David Beckham. He calls out to his fellow men, suggesting we need to learn that embarrassment is not fatal, that change is possible, and that men need to \u201cstop giving other men, and themselves, a hard time for not attaining the standards of masculinity\u201d.</p> <p>The book is written clearly and accessibly, and is so natural you can almost hear the sound of Grayson Perry\u2019s voice in your head as you read. If there is a criticism, it\u2019s that there is a slight contradiction about a man very much in the public eye calling for men to shy away from public life and \u201csit down for [their] rights\u201d. There is nothing more old-school male than believing your opinions are worthy of books and television shows. A subtler contradiction is that the attack on \u201cold-school man\u201d is perhaps a little on the brutal side, a little bullish in tone, as if subscribing to the patriarchal idea that men are tough enough to take it. Maybe there is room for all kinds of masculinity, including tough-guy lumberjacks and ice-road truckers, as long as everyone is kind to one another.</p> <p>These criticisms are, however, only slight. At a time when an old-school man like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/nigel-farage-defends-donald-trump-over-alpha-male-boasting\" title=\"\">Nigel Farage</a> can defend Trump\u2019s sleaze talk as \u201calpha-male boasting\u201d, and when Trump contextualises his \u201cbanter\u201d by resorting to the mythology of the male&#xa0;space of the locker room, clear and accessible discussions of masculinity are long overdue. This book, with its non-macho slender girth and personal, engaging approach, is a breeze of a read, and one that makes you see our male-manufactured world a little differently. And you can\u2019t really ask for more than that.</p> <p><em>Matt Haig\u2019s </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/reasons-to-stay-alive-323656.html\" title=\"\"><em>Reasons to Stay Alive</em></a><em> is out now in paperback.</em></p> <p><em>The Descent of Man is published by Allen Lane (\u00a316.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/descent-of-man-434432.html\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a313.93</em></a></p>",
  "<p>In London an exhibition has just opened at the Barbican called <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/artgallery/event-detail.asp?ID=18736\">The Vulgar</a>. It is a fashion exhibition, with clothes that are often funny, but spotlit on mannequins so nobody laughs. There\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/10/hussein-chalayan-gravity-fatigue-dance-choreography-fashion-interview\">Hussein Chalayan</a> dress covered in false nails, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/08/andre-courreges\">Courr\u00e8ges</a> minidress and 18th-century gowns the width of a studio flat. There are gold things. There are fans, which became vulgar when they were mass-produced. There are neo-classical dresses, vulgar because they are copies. Accompanying the fashions are definitions of the word by psychoanalyst Adam Phillips, which inspire the titles of each room: \u201cShowing Off,\u201d \u201cPuritan,\u201d \u201cExtreme Bodies,\u201d \u201cToo Popular,\u201d and \u201cCommon\u201d.</p> <p>I sat with a cup of tea afterwards with one eye on Twitter. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lilyallen\">Lily Allen </a>had been to the Jungle camp in Calais with the BBC and met a 13-year-old boy from Afghanistan. She broke down as she explained to him: \u201cAt three different intervals\u2026 the English in particular have put you in danger\u2026 We\u2019ve bombed your country, put you in the hands of the Taliban and now put you in danger of risking your life to get into our country. I apologise on behalf of my country. I\u2019m sorry for what we have put you through.\u201d On Twitter she was dismissed as \u201cpampered, coiffured and irrelevant\u201d, urged to \u201cspeak for herself, not the nation \u2013 she represents nobody\u201d, and received multiple warnings of rape, both for her and her daughters.</p> <p>The<em> Sun </em>said hers were \u201ccrocodile tears\u201d, writing: \u201cBefore Lily starts \u2018apologising\u2019 for Brit troops taking on the Taliban, perhaps she should say sorry for her own mistakes. Two years ago her appalling single \u2018URL Badman\u2019 tanked at No 93. Earlier this year the attention-seeking mum passed out after a bender at the Notting Hill Carnival.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/columnists/article-3837232/Lily-Allen-s-tears-pure-self-indulgence-according-JAN-MOIR.html\">Jan Moir dedicated her <em>Daily Mail</em></a><em> </em>column to Allen: \u201cJust another indulged idiot who fondly imagines herself to be a daring and provocative political voice\u2026 Darling Lily got a fabulous manicure, put on an ever-so-serious, no-make-up face and took a camera crew with her to visit the Jungle. (There ain\u2019t much in the way of practical work a gal can do with those nails, but never mind.) It looked quite good when Lily was filmed ladling out the soup for five minutes,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThe 31-year-old mother of two started crying, which must have been very confusing for the little boy, not to mention scary \u2013 but at least she didn\u2019t sing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How dare Lily Allen have an opinion about immigration? That is not what Lily Allen is for</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As I read the criticism, one of Phillips\u2019s definitions flashed to mind. Vulgar: \u201cImpossible ambition: the arrivistes, the nouveau riche, the immigrants, the upwardly mobile.\u201d People trying to be something they are not. People, like Allen, who should know their place. People trespassing on politics, on grown-up issues. She\u2019s not even a good mother so why should we take her seriously? She doesn\u2019t even have the right NAILS. How dare Lily Allen have an opinion about immigration? That is not what Lily Allen is for.</p> <p>Once the concept of vulgarity is in your head it\u2019s hard to shake it out \u2013 you recognise it in debates about Brexit, anti-semitism, homophobia. You start questioning why people like Jan Moir and the furious Tweeters find Allen\u2019s visit to Calais so threatening. Like a pensioner wearing a Topshop catsuit, Allen is parading her inappropriate views and emotions in full view of a crowd. She is getting above her station and needs to be knocked back. It\u2019s not simply about her celebrity \u2013 I can\u2019t remember a single furious column when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/22/this-seems-like-a-solvable-problem-jude-law-on-helping-calais-refugees\">Jude Law visited Calais</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/03/hollywood-stars-to-help-calais-children-reunite-with-uk-families\">Benedict Cumberbatch spoke of the \u201cutter disgrace of the British government\u201d</a> for not doing enough. But their visits weren\u2019t \u201cvulgar\u201d \u2013 there is nothing that disorients us about well-educated men speaking passionately. That\u2019s how the world is meant to sound, regardless of what they\u2019re saying.</p> <p>In the shadow of the exhibition, the whole episode made me feel sorry for those rising up to chastise Allen. If her tears and nails and apology require such scorn, doesn\u2019t it suggest a degree of desperation and fear in the scornful? After spending time with those clothes, those images, the 19th-century etiquette manuals and Elizabethan document \u201cenforcing the status of apparel\u201d on materials that were restricted according to class, I sense an ancient anxiety that the barriers these judgers rely on for structure might be disappearing. The risk being then, that their houses would simply crumble.</p> <p>Email Eva at <a href=\"mailto:e.wiseman@observer.co.uk\">e.wiseman@observer.co.uk</a> or follow her on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvaWiseman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@EvaWiseman</a></p>",
  "<p>It is the classic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPzzgE34YQY\" title=\"\"><em>Spitting Image</em> sketch</a> of Margaret Thatcher in her pomp. The satirists created a scene in which the rubber puppet of the prime minster sat at a restaurant table surrounded by her cabinet. She orders raw steak. The waitress then asks: \u201cAnd what about the vegetables?\u201d Motioning to her cringing ministers, Mrs T replies: \u201cThey\u2019ll have the same as me.\u201d</p> <p>That was a caricature. In his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/16/kind-of-blue-political-memoir-ken-clarke-review\" title=\"\">recently published memoir</a>, Ken Clarke contends that the \u201cIron Lady\u201d liked ministers who argued back and she promoted him even though they had many humdinger rows. But the Thatcher legend remains very lively in the Tory imagination. It was played up to by Theresa May when she arrived at Number 10 just over 100 days ago. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/08/the-iron-mayden-how-newspapers-in-britain-and-around-the-world-r/\" title=\"\">\u201cIron Mayden\u201d and \u201cthe new Maggie\u201d</a> were among the welcoming headlines in the rightwing press. Her team didn\u2019t object. They did not discourage anyone from portraying her as a reincarnation of the dominatrix of folklore.</p> <p>In her early days at Number 10, there was an ambition to achieve a grip over government more steely than that achieved by Mrs T even at the zenith of her power. Ministers reported that they were being forbidden to make any statement or give any interview unless it had first been cleared through Number 10. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/17/theresa-may-brexit-early-general-election\" title=\"\">I wrote at the time</a> that Mrs May would discover that she would not be able to impose such a stifling level of control. What I did not foresee \u2013 and neither did she nor anyone else \u2013 is just how rapidly cabinet cohesion would unravel. Discipline is now breaking down in a way that Mrs T would never have tolerated.</p> <p>There are almost daily reveals of confidential papers prepared for internal discussions between ministers, especially of anything touching on Brexit. Mrs May says she will not give a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on how she plans to approach the negotiations. We don\u2019t need one because we have a running tap of leaks from within her cabinet. These are being accompanied by a drip feed of poisonous briefings, as some ministers try to promote themselves and their ambitions at the expense of rivals they seek to thwart or damage.</p> <p>At the most recent prime minister\u2019s questions, Mr Clarke was moved to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/ken-clarke-accuses-brexit-tory-ministers-of-launching-political-attacks-on-cabinet-colleagues_uk_58075ecbe4b07ebc072be99a\" title=\"\">condemn the \u201cBrexiter ministers\u201d</a> whom he identified as the principal culprits. He urged Mrs May to get them under control. The majority of the cabinet agree. Most of them are not incessantly leaking and relentlessly briefing. The well behaved are growing furious with the troublemakers. \u201cKen is right,\u201d says one senior minister angered by the antics of some of his colleagues. \u201cTheresa needs to grip this before it spirals out of control.\u201d It only takes a few to make mischief. It doesn\u2019t take long for mischief to turn into mayhem. The next stop on the line after mayhem is anarchy.</p> <p>The copious leaking and nasty briefing is being accompanied by a mounting number of public rebukes by Number 10 of ministers who are deemed to have spoken out of turn. The three Brexiters \u2013 Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox \u2013 have all been give the ceremonial \u201cslap-down\u201d. This was the cause of some satisfaction over at the Treasury, which has had a never less than fractious relationship with the Brexiters.</p> <p>Last week, it was the turn of the second most important person in the government to feel the sting of the prime minister\u2019s displeasure. On Wednesday, the chancellor suggested that students could be excluded from the net migration target. The following day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/20/students-could-be-left-out-of-immigration-figures-ministers-hint\" title=\"\">he was publicly told off</a> by the next-door neighbour when Number 10 declared that this was \u201ccategorically\u201d not Mrs May\u2019s position. These reprimands are only superficially a display of strength. If ministers were really afraid of incurring the wrath of the boss, they would not get out of line in the first place.</p> <p>Some of Mrs May\u2019s problems with managing her government are down to her style. She is famous among colleagues for what one minister calls her \u201clong silences\u201d. She lets other people babble on, while giving away little about what she thinks. Many of us have encountered managers who think this is a clever technique. The trouble with it as a way of running a government is that it leaves ministers without a clear guide to what the boss really wants and encourages the pursuit of individual agendas.</p> <p>Tony Blair was much attacked for emasculating the cabinet as a decision-making body and making the big calls with small huddles of trusties in the prime ministerial den, what became known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/may/16/comment.labour\" title=\"\">\u201csofa government\u201d</a>. A similar criticism was levelled at David Cameron. Mrs May set out with the intention of restoring the traditional model of \u201ccollective cabinet responsibility\u201d. Ministers would argue things out in private. Everyone would get an opportunity to have their say behind closed doors, but once a decision was made, all would be expected to unify around it in public. There is a lot to be said in favour of a less cliquey, more formal method of cabinet government, but it can only work if everyone can be relied on to obey the rules.</p> <p>Mrs May is beginning to learn why her predecessors became so wary of having frank and full-blooded discussions in cabinet and its committees. Unless everyone around the table can be trusted to respect the confidentiality of the meeting, there is a high risk that partial accounts of their discussions will be leaked by ministers seeking to advantage themselves and undermine competitors.</p> <p>Then there is a lingering legacy of the coalition years. When the Conservative and Lib Dem ministers first went into government together, they colluded in the fiction that they were all one big happy family. As time went on and tensions increased, they became more open about ventilating their differences in public. This loosened the bonds of collective responsibility. They were then shattered when <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35230959\" title=\"\">David Cameron permitted his cabinet</a> to campaign on both sides of the Brexit referendum. Ministers acquired the habit of arguing with each other on TV \u2013 and in the most vituperative terms.</p> <p>It is harder for the prime minister to reassert the authority of her office when she hasn\u2019t won an election in her own right. Some of her friends think she ought to make an example of one of the leakers and fire him, but that would be risky when she has a small majority and a large number of enemies already sitting on her backbenches.</p> <p>Added to that is a change in the dynamics between Numbers 10 and 11. The most important relationship in any government is that between the prime minister and chancellor. When they form a solid axis, they can dominate the cabinet. If that relationship breaks down, all hell tends to break loose. Mrs May chose Philip Hammond as her chancellor because she has known him since they were at Oxford together and they had a decent relationship as ministers. His unflashy, deadpan style seemed suited to the challenge of soothing markets rattled by Brexit.</p> <p>The duo now find themselves, to an extent neither had anticipated, on different sides of several arguments. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/17/philip-hammond-not-lone-voice-caution-on-brexit\" title=\"\">His priority </a>is to protect financial services, the car industry and all the other elements of the economy that will be imperilled by a bad Brexit. That angles him towards a softer version of departure than the prime minister, who places much more emphasis on control of immigration. It ought to disturb them both that they have already got to the point where he has to deny that he is contemplating resignation and she has to issue a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/17/philip-hammonds-brexit-worries-point-to-cabinet-tensions\" title=\"\">statement expressing \u201cfull confidence\u201d</a> in her chancellor.</p> <p>It used to be a reliable rule that divided parties don\u2019t win elections. Tories can be forgiven for thinking that this stricture doesn\u2019t apply to them anymore, especially in the absence of a credible threat from their external opponents. The Conservatives were obviously divided about Europe before the 2015 election and still managed to squeak a parliamentary majority. They fought each other viciously during the referendum and that battle goes on in a new form. Yet they still enjoy double-digit leads in opinion polls. This is encouraging some Tories to believe that there is no longer a penalty for being undisciplined.</p> <p>Yet there are big reasons why it does still matter that the government is advertising its divisions to the world. It is hard to come to sensible decisions when the cabinet leaks like a sieve. As a writer about politics and as a citizen, I love a juicy leak, because it exposes arguments within government that would otherwise remain hidden. But I take the point that it becomes impossible for ministers to conduct candid and productive discussions if they live in constant fear that anything they say to each other in private will appear on the front page of the next day\u2019s newspapers. Making a success of Brexit \u2013 or at least limiting the economic damage inflicted by it \u2013 will depend on fashioning a coherent and unified negotiating position and convincing the EU that Britain has a serious and trustworthy government. That is all undermined when key ministers are at war with each other. It also compounds the Brexit-induced febrility in financial markets.</p> <p>As for Mrs May, she acquired her early popularity with voters by projecting herself as a steady and competent hand on the tiller. That image will be increasingly hard to sustain when the public begins to notice that her crew are at each other\u2019s throats.</p>",
  "<p>This weekend marks four months since the country voted to leave the European Union and there is as yet no consensus on how we progress. We are a nation stuck in an impasse, where a language and culture of intolerance are beginning to emerge. Left unchecked, this could take us to a place where neither Leave nor Remain voters intended us to go.</p> <p>Theresa May must take her share of responsibility for this. Her approach to Brexit has been chaotic, at best. The lack of a strong vision has created a vacuum. And into this vacuum have stepped the hardliners, imposing on the result their own narrative, deciding what the British people really meant. Not all those who voted to leave voted for a hard Brexit. We all know the reality is far more nuanced. Moderate voices have felt attacked and pushed out. As a result, the tone and dialogue in our public spaces online and offline is changing. Intolerance, fear and insecurity are on the rise.</p> <p>Last week, I asked a range of people across the country and in my local community what they felt, now we are four months on. What came back did not make for light reading. \u201cLanguage used by people who were Brexiters has become much more aggressive,\u201d said one. Another: \u201cI saw a woman approached by a man on the street who shouted, \u2018Are you going to go home now you \u2013 we voted you out.\u2019\u201d One headteacher said: \u201cThe day after the vote, for the first time in three years, our year 2 pupils were racially abused outside with \u2018Go back home\u2019.\u201d Another said: \u201cThe elephant in the room is the incessant and systematic bullying, berating and gagging of a huge portion of our society, people who voted to remain and who still believe that in a democracy they should continue to have a voice in what happens next.\u201d</p> <p>The post-Brexit debate is becoming less reasoned, more toxic and more intolerant. Last week could have offered a chink of light. Theresa May faced her first electoral test and it did not go well. She pounded the streets and knocked on doors of this safe Tory part of Oxfordshire alongside David Cameron. The results of her campaigning? T<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/witney-byelection-lib-dems-tories-slashed-majority\" title=\"\">he Conservatives\u2019 majority was slashed</a> by nearly 20,000 votes.</p> <p>Could this be a turning point? As the three Brexiters hurtle towards hard Brexit without a thought for casualties, perhaps, just perhaps, Witney could be the wake-up call for May that we need.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a child from an Asian family I expected to be spat at or have something  thrown at me. I thought those days were over</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A nation of division, intolerance, lower living standards and a slowing economy is not what people voted for.

Around 40% of our household shopping basket is imported. As food prices rise, families on low incomes will be increasingly squeezed and hit the hardest. As May puts her party politics ahead of our economy and national interest, people are starting to notice.</p> <p>Language matters and political rhetoric has consequences. The public mood can change quickly. We have a responsibility to watch the way we speak over the next years and how we talk about Britain\u2019s future. It is not a coincidence that racist or religious hate crime incidents recorded have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/hate-crimes-eu-referendum-home-office-figures-confirm\" title=\"\">risen by 41%</a> in the aftermath of the referendum. It is a consequence.</p> <p>Something terribly unBritish is developing and it is damaging our social fabric and our image abroad. It is so very far removed from the Britain we have known for the last generation. We have built up a strong reputation as an outward-looking country and a global player. The debate after the referendum \u2013 more than the vote itself \u2013 is what may irrevocably destroy this reputation.</p> <p>Amber Rudd\u2019s call for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/government-faces-backlash-from-business-leaders-over-foreign-workers\" title=\"\">register of foreign workers</a> and her misguided speech at the Tory conference at a time when we need, more than ever, to come together and work collaboratively with so many issues on the world stage was highly irresponsible.</p> <p>Yet any challenge to this narrative can result in calls that question our patriotism. When it comes to Brexit, like anything else, it is vital for our democracy that we should be able to challenge and scrutinise. If parliamentarians raise concerns about the challenges ahead and stand up for the interests of voters, we are, it\u2019s said, \u201cundemocratic\u201d. But voices of moderation or inclusion should not be frozen out. There is not only one way to Brexit.</p> <p>Last week, Theresa May called for Britain to still have a central role in Europe until we leave. That\u2019s welcome but, sadly, three months late. Because of her choice not to speak earlier, our MEPs doing important work on tax avoidance and other issues have already started to find themselves sidelined. And now that sidelining has extended to May herself \u2013 she cut an isolated figure as she was given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/theresa-may-awkward-eu-meeting-sees-little-progress-on-brexit\" title=\"\">five minutes to speak on Brexit at 1am</a>.</p> <p>In my 20 years of political activism, I cannot remember a time when we had such an unshared sense of who we are as a nation. Just four years ago, we stood together side by side as our nation hosted one of the most successful Olympics ever, our winning ticket being a message of openness, pride in our diversity and confidence in our place in the world. Mo Farah became a national hero, a young Somalian who had come to Britain as a refugee and grown up, like me, in Feltham, west London.</p> <p>I\u2019d like to believe that a young Mo Farah would today have the same chances and be able to serve his country, But with the language currently heard around child refugees, it does make me wonder. We are a nation with a bigger heart and a bigger purpose. It\u2019s not too late to correct the course we are on. But it has to start at the top. It has to start with Theresa May.</p>",

Cedars was shut by the government in July after criticism over the policy of holding children and families awaiting removal from the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/oct/21/refugee-children-uk-bureaucracy-social-work\">Refugee children arriving in the UK need support \u2013 not bureaucracy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another negative side-effect of the Home Office\u2019s approach has meant that, despite all the Calais child refugees allowed in having relatives in Britain, only a few have been settled with family members because checks had not been carried out. Instead, a number of younger unaccompanied minors have been placed in foster care because the required background checks and assessments have yet to be conducted.</p> <p>A source close to the process said: \u201cPolitically the Home Office did not want this to happen, so it didn\u2019t. Therefore as the camp comes to closure it\u2019s a panic \u2013 all the work you should have done over three to six months you do over three to six hours. They cannot place the child in a number of cases because none of the checks are done.\u201d</p> <p>Andy Elvin, chief executive of the Adolescent and Children\u2019s Trust (Tact), Britain\u2019s largest fostering and adoption charity, said: \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing for a developed nation not to have managed this more professionally. We\u2019re not even talking about a massive number of children.\u201d</p> <p>The plan was drawn up six months ago and agreed two months ago by the Local Government Association and adoption services, although discussions to create a framework to resettle Syrian child refugees go back as far as September 2015.</p> <p>The Home Office said it would not comment on the specifics of its refugee resettlement programme. Labour MP Yvette Cooper MP said: \u201cThose arriving this weekend include some of the most vulnerable teenage girls who were at immense risk from sexual exploitation and trafficking gangs. The French authorities need to do much more to get children and young people into safety.</p> <p>And Britain needs to keep doing its bit to help, or hundreds more children and teenagers will disappear. That is what the Dubs amendment was for and it is thanks to Alf and many of the charities who have been working so hard that it is starting to be implemented now.\u201d</p>",
