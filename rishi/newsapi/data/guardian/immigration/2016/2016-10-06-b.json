  "<p>Fresh evidence of skills shortages has fanned fears about British companies\u2019 long-term prospects if the government follows through on talk of an immigration crackdown.</p> <p>A monthly check on the recruitment market published on Friday added to signs that employers have rebounded from the initial shock of the Brexit vote at least for now. Permanent hiring rose for the second month running in September, after declining in June and July. </p> <p>But the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) also found the availability of permanent and temporary staff continued to fall in September. At the same time demand for staff continued to rise and there was solid growth in starting salaries for people placed in permanent jobs.</p> <p>The trade body said that based on its poll of 400 recruitment consultancies, those jobs suffering skills shortages included accountants, HGV drivers, architects, care workers, scientists and toolmakers. For temporary jobs there were shortages of electricians, call centre staff and bricklayers.</p> <p>Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-consigns-cameron-to-history-in-populist-speech\">hinted at a tougher line on immigration</a> in her speech to the Conservative party conference this week and home secretary Amber Rudd <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/government-faces-backlash-from-business-leaders-over-foreign-workers\">incited a backlash from business leaders</a> over proposals to force companies to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/amber-rudd-defends-proposal-to-make-firms-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers\">disclose how many foreign workers they employ</a>. </p> <p>REC policy director Tom Hadley said the government must be mindful that many UK employers were already facing talent shortages. <br></p> <p>\u201cDespite some of the rhetoric at this week\u2019s Conservative party conference, we will continue to need workers from overseas in a range of sectors from engineering to healthcare,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe business community must have a role in developing an immigration model that strikes the right balance.\u201d <br></p> <p>The report, compiled for REC by data company IHS Markit, showed that as demand for staff rose and skills shortages continued to be felt, successful job candidates were able to secure higher starting salaries last month. </p> <p>Companies\u2019 apparent willingness to continue hiring despite worries over Brexit chimes with other recent indicators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/post-referendum-gloom-fears-confounded-economic-evidence\">suggesting business activity and confidence has rebounded</a>.</p> <p>UK business confidence recovered to be almost at pre-referendum levels during September driven by large increases in organisations\u2019 optimism for both the UK economy and their own prospects over the coming year, according to a poll from YouGov released on Friday.<br></p> <p>For first time since the referendum, more than half of businesses were optimistic about their prospects in the next year, according to YouGov\u2019s report, which was compiled with the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) using responses from 500 business people.</p> <p>The report\u2019s main business confidence index rose to 112.4 last month, not far off June\u2019s reading of 112.6 and May\u2019s 112.5.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is now clear that business confidence took a short-term stumble in the wake of the EU vote instead of a long-term fall,\u201d said Scott Corfe, director at the CEBR.<br></p> <p>\u201cHowever, it should be noted that this research was carried out before the Conservative party conference and all the talk of \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 implying that the UK would prioritise immigration restrictions over access to the European single market. Once the shape of our economic relationship with the EU becomes clearer, these figures could shift notably.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>The Socceroos have hung on for a 2-2 draw with Saudi Arabia as striker Nasser Al Shamrani again proved the troublemaker against Australia. A draw may disappoint but the Socceroos\u2019 improving mentality bodes well for World Cup campaign.</p> <p>If a scrappy equaliser blots Australia\u2019s copybook the difference in mentality between Australia and Saudi Arabia speaks volumes as to the Socceroos\u2019 long-term maturation. Amid the hot and humid conditions of Jeddah\u2019s King Abdullah Stadium, Socceroos boss Ange Postecoglou captured the team\u2019s mood post-game accurately and succinctly: \u201cIt\u2019s a good point, but you feel we could have got more out of it.\u201d</p> <p>An objective onlooker, he isn\u2019t. But even the most partisan fan would struggle to dispute his assessment. In a fleeting vignette of their potential Saudi Arabia started the brighter of the two sides, hurrying and harrying the Australian defence with a high press, and striking with a clarity of purpose and quality of execution.</p> <p>Their fifth-minute goal followed excellent lead up work from Nawaf Al Abid, who used close control and an attacking mindset to put a sharp ball through for Yahia Al Shehri, whose inch-perfect cutback was well dispatched by the late-arriving Taiseer Al Jassam.</p> <p>It was a passage of play that cut straight through the Australian defence and sent an early warning shot across the bows of those that denigrate the ever-increasing quality of Asian football.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/06/arsene-wenger-arsenal-future-will-be-mutually-decided-chief-executive-ivan-gazidis\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s Arsenal future will be mutually decided, says chief executive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet, with Australia seemingly there for the taking, two serious limitations \u2013 a creeping psychological fragility and Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk\u2019s conservative inclination \u2013 always presented as a potential limitation for the home side.</p> <p>A coach can only play the cards he is dealt but van Marwijk showed his hand at the 2010 World Cup. Given aces like Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben or Rafael van der Vaart the former Feyenoord boss gambled on eights and nines.</p> <p>The pragmatist will say van Marwijk saw in twin enforcers Mark van Bommel and Nigel de Jong a comparative advantage for his nation, and exploited that ruthlessly as the Dutch shaded five consecutive games by a one-goal margin en route to one of the more notorious finals in recent history. But those who hang their cap on the hatstand of results quickly fade when the fixtures turn.</p> <p>With the crowd behind them, confidence streaming through the players, this game was Saudi Arabia\u2019s to lose. The usually excellent Aaron Mooy missed passes. Robbie Kruse and Mathew Leckie returned to ponderousness in attack, even skipper Mile Jedinak looked lumbering, a needless yellow card following one particular cameo in rustiness.</p> <p>But if Saudi Arabia invited their opponents upon them, then conversely Australia deserve praise for the manner in which they accepted the invitation.</p> <p>As the half developed the Socceroos began to raise their intensity. Mooy\u2019s industry began to sway the balance in the heart of the field, Rogic increasingly looked the pre-eminent playmaker on the pitch and by the time Brad Smith, nervous in his opening exchanges, decided to take on his man, work inside and produce a driving run and shot that clattered the post, Australia were well and truly in the ascendency. </p> <p>It was Trent Sainsbury who executed the goal, but it was an equaliser that hailed from the ongoing project of self-belief that Ange Postecoglou has spent years trying to instil within the Socceroos. </p> <p>The 51,616 strong crowd arrived in pageantry with a stunning half-stadium tifo to support their side and had a vocal lead supporter \u2013 half capo, half muezzin \u2013 calling the Green Falcons on to victory, but they were silenced. For all the bombast pre-game of making King Abdullah Stadium \u201chell\u201d for the Socceroos, the crowd rarely seemed a factor for Australia.</p> <p>Instead of trusting in the talent of Al Abid, Al Shehri or Al Jassam to once again crack open Australia, Saudi Arabia instead leant on gamesmanship \u2013 shoelaces refused to stay tied; cramps laid low athletes in their prime, and the goalkeeper played with ribs of rare Venetian glass.</p> <p>As Postecoglou bellowed for his team to keep focus, to stay sharp and to rise above, van Marwijk looked uneasy, eyes twitching as he paced the technical area. The otherwise excellent Omar Hawsawi succumbed to injury, but the Socceroos refused to allow what initially looked a dubious call for the stretcher to break their rhythm. And less than a minute later they took a deserved lead.</p> <p>Kruse \u2013 too often Australia\u2019s Theo Walcott \u2013 executed a perfect arching cross. Tomi Juric, another who continues to grow into his role was on hand to finish ruthlessly. </p> <p>Stop the contest there and Postecoglou and his men, as they did against the UAE, have executed their game plan to absolute perfection, overcoming near-inhumane conditions and numerous logistical challenges to land another emphatic blow on an Asian powerhouse.</p> <p>But after an eighteen month absence from the national side, Al Shamrani was always bristling to become the defining narrative. Like so many champions, the five-time Saudi domestic league golden boot winner displays a confidence that on a daily basis would prove unbearable. But the renewed hope his substitution gave the crowd and the confidence his goal gave his teammates was notable.</p> <p>The Socceroos might feel aggrieved to have dropped potentially crucial points, but the improved mentality they showed throughout this performance places them in good stead for the campaign ahead. Japan on Tuesday is a litmus test, but irrespective of individual results a long-run trend of maturation and self-belief continues to develop.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s core supporters may back his views on curbing immigration \u2013 but they disagree with him over global trade and US involvement in Nato, an opinion poll has found.</p> <p>Trump has made opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal between the US and Asia a central theme of his populist campaign, but more of his base favour it (49%) than oppose it (46%), according to the <a href=\"https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/publication/america-age-uncertainty?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ccs-report\">2016 Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey</a>.</p> <p>In another surprising finding, despite Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/07/03/484574128/sanders-centers-platform-fight-on-trans-pacific-trade-deal\">vocal criticism of the TPP</a> during the Democratic primary, some 56% of his supporters back the agreement, as do 74% of Hillary Clinton\u2019s.</p> <p>The annual survey suggests a gap between the views of those who shout loudest during the presidential election and the more nuanced positions of many Democratic and Republican voters on the ground, most of whom want America to remain engaged with the world.</p> <p>As expected, immigration does seem to be a vote winner for Trump, who has been accused of inciting hatred and violence. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/trump-comments-mexico-rapists-planned-deposition-video\">Trump\u2019s rhetoric on immigrants</a> and refugees has most clearly struck a chord with his base,\u201d notes the report, published on Thursday. \u201cOn each and every question concerning immigration, Trump\u2019s core supporters are the least favorable.\u201d</p> <p>An overwhelming majority of core Trump supporters (80%) agree that immigration is a critical threat to the US \u2013 almost double the percentage among the general public (43%). Six in 10 Trump supporters believe that undocumented immigrants in the US should be forced to leave their jobs, and the country. And nine in 10 Trump supporters support \u201cexpanding the 700 miles of border wall and fencing with Mexico\u201d. The public overall is divided on expanding the wall, and 58% support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>On other issues, however, Trump\u2019s regular battle cries appear to have less resonance. Although the Republican candidate said in July that \u201cNato is obsolete\u201d and complained that \u201cmany member countries [are] not paying their fair share\u201d, 51% of his followers want to keep the US commitment to the military alliance as it is now and 9% actually want to increase it. Just 13% favour withdrawal from Nato.<br></p> <p>While Trump has promised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/donald-trump-foreign-policy-speech\">an \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy</a> and said US allies must pay for the cost of being defended, his backers are equally or more likely than other Americans to support long-term US military bases in Australia, Germany, Japan and South Korea.</p> <p>Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, <a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/public-opinion-and-americas-next-global-priorities\">told an audience at the Wilson Center thinktank</a> in Washington on Thursday: \u201cThe numbers are quite surprising. Even among core Trump supporters, 60% think that the United States should either maintain or increase its commitment to Nato. It\u2019s 75% for Americans overall. That\u2019s a remarkable number.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s gratifying to see that in this, and in fact in so many other aspects of the poll, you find an American public that remains dedicated to the kind of open, engaged foreign policy and global engagement that we in many ways have taken for granted for a very long time and has been the basis until very recently of a bipartisan political consensus in this country.\u201d</p> <p>A decade ago more Republicans than Democrats said globalisation had been good for the US, but now 74% of Democrats view globalisation in a positive light compared with 59% of Republicans. Daalder added: \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty strong number. You wouldn\u2019t know that if you talked to any congressman or senator from the Democratic party. Maybe one or two dinosaurs are still there but there are not many of them.\u201d</p> <p>The findings suggest that politicians are not always in touch with the public mood, Kori Schake, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said during the same panel discussion: \u201cOne of the things that I found most interesting in the numbers is that 56% of Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters support the TPP. A vast majority of Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters support it and you would never know that from listening to the campaign rhetoric.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/trump-clinton-free-trade-policies-tpp\">Clinton has joined Sanders and Trump </a>in opposing the TPP in what some see as an expedient move, although Schake speculated that, if elected, she might find a way to modify it while keeping it essentially intact.</p> <p>The survey was conducted from 10 to 27 June among a representative national sample of 2,061 adults. The label of \u201ccore Trump supporter\u201d was based on respondents\u2019 answer to a presidential preference question.</p> <p>The report concludes: \u201cThe changing demographic makeup of America will likely transform the political dynamics, given that younger and non-white Americans are more supportive of globalization, immigration and increasing ties to the world. But in the near term, the attitudes and opinions that brought Trump to the fore of American politics will remain \u2013 and could very well strengthen.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama has defended free trade and condemned \u201ccrude populism\u201d in what is in effect an open letter to his successor in the White House.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/ObamaEssay\">Writing in the Economist</a>, the president does not mention Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump by name but makes clear that he disagrees with both candidates\u2019 opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).</p> <p>Obama sets out a vision for America\u2019s future based on boosting productivity growth, combating rising inequality, providing meaningful work opportunities and shoring up the economy against financial storms.</p> <p>In what the Economist describes as \u201ca trenchant, unapologetically centrist essay\u201d entitled \u201cThe Way Ahead\u201d, Obama, who leaves office in January, acknowledges that an anxiety over globalisation had taken hold in the US, not unlike the discontent leading to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Britain\u2019s vote in June to leave the European Union</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/trump-clinton-free-trade-policies-tpp\">Trump and Clinton's free trade retreat: a pivotal moment for the world's economic future</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At home and abroad, he writes, people ask him: \u201cWhy have some on the far left and even more on the far right embraced a crude populism that promises a return to a past that is not possible to restore \u2013 and that, for most Americans, never existed at all?\u201d</p> <p>Obama offers what he believes is a reality check: \u201cThe world is more prosperous than ever before and yet our societies are marked by uncertainty and unease. So we have a choice \u2013 retreat into old, closed-off economies or press forward, acknowledging the inequality that can come with globalisation while committing ourselves to making the global economy work better for all people, not just those at the top.\u201d </p> <p>In an election year characterised by a wave of anti-trade sentiment from Trump and Democratic primary contender Bernie Sanders, Obama contends that globalisation has been by far a net positive for the American economy.</p> <p>\u201cLifting productivity and wages also depends on creating a global race to the top in rules for trade,\u201d Obama contends. \u201cWhile some communities have suffered from foreign competition, trade has helped our economy much more than it has hurt. Exports helped lead us out of the recession. American firms that export pay their workers up to 18% more on average than companies that do not, according to a report by my Council of Economic Advisers.\u201d<br></p> <p>Clinton has joined Trump and Sanders in speaking out against the TPP, although some analysts suspect that, should she win the presidency, she will seek to repackage the deal in a manner that allows her to approve it. Obama pledges to keep pushing for Congress to pass the TPP because, he says, it will level the playing field for workers and businesses.</p> <p>In an obvious swipe at Trump, Obama writes of the current air of discontent: \u201cThe anti-immigrant, anti-Mexican, anti-Muslim and anti-refugee sentiment expressed by some Americans today echoes nativist lurches of the past \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Alien.html\">the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798</a>, the Know-Nothings of the mid-1800s, the anti-Asian sentiment in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and any number of eras in which Americans were told they could restore past glory if they just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. We overcame those fears and we will again.\u201d</p> <p>But he acknowledges that some of the unrest is rooted in \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d about decades of declining productivity growth and rising inequality resulting in slower income growth for low- and middle-income families. The financial crisis of 2008 only seemed to increase the isolation of corporations and elites.</p> <p>\u201cSo it\u2019s no wonder that so many are receptive to the argument that the game is rigged. But amid this understandable frustration, much of it fanned by politicians who would actually make the problem worse rather than better, it is important to remember that capitalism has been the greatest driver of prosperity and opportunity the world has ever known.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/03/2016-economy-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-reagan\">Back to the future: economy becomes battle between Reagan and Bill Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clinton is attempting a broad church election campaign that embraces some ideas from Sanders, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/10/13/sanders-democratic-debate-bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-5.cnn\">a self-proclaimed socialist</a>, but also has the centrist Obama as a leading surrogate. During an electrifying primary campaign, Sanders argued for the breakup of the Wall Street banks. But the president urges against quick fix solutions. </p> <p>\u201cFurther progress requires recognising that America\u2019s economy is an enormously complicated mechanism,\u201d he writes. \u201cAs appealing as some more radical reforms can sound in the abstract \u2013 breaking up all the biggest banks or erecting prohibitively steep tariffs on imports \u2013 the economy is not an abstraction. It cannot simply be redesigned wholesale and put back together again without real consequences for real people.\u201d</p> <p>Obama does, however, devote a section of the essay to widening inequality \u2013 a key theme of Sanders and Massachusetts <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/eugene-robinson-elizabeth-warren-makes-the-case-on-income-inequality/2014/10/20/ba54c68e-588a-11e4-8264-deed989ae9a2_story.html?utm_term=.36595d694337\">senator Elizabeth Warren</a> \u2013 and its negative economic and moral consequences. In 1979, he says, the top 1% of American families received 7% of all after-tax income; by 2007, that share had more than doubled to 17%.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis challenges the very essence of who Americans are as a people. We don\u2019t begrudge success, we aspire to it and admire those who achieve it. In fact, we\u2019ve often accepted more inequality than many other nations because we are convinced that with hard work, we can improve our own station and watch our children do even better.\u201d</p> <p>He cites technology, education, globalisation, declining unions and a falling minimum wage as factors in growing inequality. \u201cBut I believe that changes in culture and values have also played a major role. In the past, differences in pay between corporate executives and their workers were constrained by a greater degree of social interaction between employees at all levels \u2013 at church, at their children\u2019s schools, in civic organisations.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why CEOs took home about 20 to 30 times as much as their average worker. The reduction or elimination of this constraining factor is one reason why today\u2019s CEO is now paid over 250 times more.\u201d</p> <p>He urges the next occupant of the White House: \u201cIn the future, we need to be even more aggressive in enacting measures to reverse the decades-long rise in inequality. Unions should play a critical role. They help workers get a bigger slice of the pie but they need to be flexible enough to adapt to global competition.\u201d</p> <p>He also calls for increasing the federal minimum wage, expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without dependent children and limiting tax breaks for high-income households.</p> <p>Obama further notes that in 1953, just 3% of men between 25 and 54 years old were out of the workforce. Today, it is 12%. In 1999, 23% of prime-age women were out of the workforce. Today, it is 26%.</p> <p>\u201cInvoluntary joblessness takes a toll on life satisfaction, self-esteem, physical health and mortality. It is related to a devastating rise of opioid abuse and an associated increase in overdose deaths and suicides among non-college-educated Americans \u2013 the group where labour-force participation has fallen most precipitously.\u201d</p> <p>Obama proposes increasing access to community colleges and providing wage insurance to those workers who cannot find a job that pays as well as their previous one. He says paid leave and guaranteed sick leave would also encourage flexibility that could lead to more people working. </p> <p>Championing the achievements of his eight-year presidency, led by preventing the 2008 financial crisis from turning into a great depression, Obama says a foundation was laid for a better future. He suggests that the US should prepare for negative shocks to the economy before they occur and not have to fight for emergency measures in a time of need.</p> <p>\u201cAmerica must stay committed to working with all nations to build stronger and more prosperous economies for all our citizens for generations to come,\u201d he writes. </p>",

That was about all I knew, because what I thought I knew about making a rainbow layer cake itself could fit in a teaspoon: I went to a cookery supply store and clutched blindly at a newfangled-looking cake tin with silicone bits (all the easier to pop the cake out, apparently), grabbed five gel food dyes (with which I could create the \u201cminimum of five\u201d coloured layers), and choofed home to get cracking.</p> <p>After a quick perusal online, I figured the bulk of the entries would be either rainbow cakes in the most literal sense, or colour gradients (beloved of Pinterest boards). I decided to combine the two concepts, and went for a \u201ctropical sunset\u201d colour palette, deep purple through to sunny yellow, in coconut tea cake.</p> <p>I probably don\u2019t need to tell you that cooking six individual cake layers with only one cake tin and a mysterious rental oven is probably not the best way to go about these things; cooking the cake layers alone took me about eight hours. I trimmed the domes from each layer with a fancy cake-trimming wire tool, and only thought once or twice about whether you could garrotte someone with it. </p> <p>With a wrestling match to attend in between, I knew that I would be icing the cake at 11pm the night before intake at the Showgrounds. I threw on a crumb coat (a thin, smooth layer of icing designed to trap stray crumbs before applying the next layer), mummified the cake in Glad-Wrap, and slammed the fridge door.</p> <p>Four hours later, hoarse from screaming my way through a no-holds-barred tag-team match, I returned home to finish the icing. I settled on four colours \u2013 a truncated version of the layers\u2019 gradient \u2013 and set about whipping the icing. (My housemate, diplomatically, turned her headphones up and shut her door.) After a disastrous attempt at a smooth finish, the sort I had seen on pastel-toned cookery blogs during my week of research, I decided to recreate my winning 2007 icing technique, spreading the icing into \u201cpetals\u201d like a fancy trowel sweep on a 1960s house wall. At around 2:30am, I went to bed.</p> <p>Mum and I managed to deliver the cake to the Showgrounds the next morning without any major catastrophes, but as soon as my entry was scanned in, I was wracked with doubt: it\u2019s too colourful, all the other entries have white icing, there are so many air bubbles in the sponge cake, I should have put it on a smaller cake board, what if they don\u2019t like the flavours?</p> <p>Reader, I won.</p> <p>My cake was awarded a beautiful blue rosette, and I a bewilderingly fancy food processor, and I floated about a foot off the ground for a good week. According to the official judges\u2019 comments, it was my \u201cvery good presentation\u201d that landed my Technicolor-dream-cake in first place; when I finally got to see my cake cut open alongside the other entries, I laughed out loud at how aggressively colourful it was. My cake turned up in the Instagram feeds of people I didn\u2019t know; people I did posed for portraits by it. Over the course of the Show I visited it five times.</p> <p>People have asked what the key to the \u201cvery good presentation\u201d is, and in competition terms, it\u2019s a combination of colour, icing, flavour, cake texture and neatness of the display. Honestly, though, I think it all boils down to the icing. So, with that in mind, let me welcome you into a world of icing pleasure with this indispensable buttercream recipe. As GoldenEye\u2019s Borish Grishenko might say, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20elMaVZ9lg\">it is </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20elMaVZ9lg\"><em>invincible</em></a>! (At least until next year\u2019s Royal Melbourne Show.)</p> <h2><strong>Fluffy strawberry icing</strong></h2> <p>This recipe is enough to ice a small cake with one or two layers. If you\u2019re going for the whole six-layer rainbow spectacular, just double everything, but don\u2019t change the steps (i.e add one tablespoon of milk at a time, not two). It will take a little longer but you\u2019ll be glad of the end result.<br></p> <p>125g of butter (see note)<br>1\u00bd cups of Soft Icing Mixture<br>2 tbs of milk<br>2 tbs of pureed strawberries or a few drops strawberry flavouring<br>A few drops of gel food dye (optional)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bccab4c50d294f94b9bed65e81f19c02408853d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bccab4c50d294f94b9bed65e81f19c02408853d7/267_105_1871_1976/947.jpg\" alt=\"Clem Bastow\u2019s rainbow cake after icing\" width=\"947\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clem Bastow\u2019s rainbow cake after icing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clem Bastow</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Note: if you ask me, the secret to a really beautiful buttercream is to use unsalted butter; it has a lighter, \u201cmilkier\u201d flavour, and seems to lose its yellow colour a little more readily during whipping. However, for chocolate or caramel flavoured icing, or when you\u2019re icing a cake that\u2019s already very sweet, salted butter can provide a nice contrast. In terms of actual whipped texture, however, the difference is immaterial.</p> <p>Leave the butter out at room temperature to soften up a little; you don\u2019t want it melting, but too hard and it will just fly out of the mixer in chunks (trust me on this). Cut it into smaller cubes, and using a mixer with a whisk attachment \u2013 ordinary beaters are fine if you don\u2019t have one \u2013 beat the butter for about 10 to 15 minutes until it looks like whipped cream. </p> <p>(Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have a fancy MixMaster-type machine; I made my rainbow layer cake icing using a stick blender with a whisk attachment. It got very hot but did the job in the end.</p> <p>The most important part of buttercream icing science is combining the icing sugar completely; you don\u2019t want any grittiness. For this reason, Soft Icing Mixture, which has a dash of added tapioca starch, will give you a smoother finish than pure icing sugar. Plain icing sugar is fine, but expect some tougher edges.</p> <p>Sift half the sugar into the bowl; if you\u2019d like to avoid being covered in a fine layer of sugar dust as soon as you turn the mixer on, gently combine the whipped butter and sugar with a spatula first. Then, beat the mixture for two minutes or until well combined, add a tablespoon of milk, and beat for another two minutes. Repeat this process until all the sugar and milk is added and the icing is fluffy but firm (you should be able to form a peak on your spatula that stays put if you hold it upside down).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/20/best-baking-recipes-from-2014-ruby-tandoh\">Ruby Tandoh\u2019s best bakes | Ruby Tandoh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I prefer to add the flavour and colour once all the other ingredients have been well combined. Strawberry puree will give the icing a really fresh flavour, as well as authentic colour and \u201cseed distribution\u201d, but I also have a lot of time for Queen\u2019s new \u201cStrawb\u2019ry &amp; Cream\u201d flavour. It smells really strong in the bottle (not unlike the alcopops of distant memory) but if you use about a half a teaspoon, the end result is lovely and light. If you want to colour your icing, gel food dyes will combine more readily than ye olde four-colour droppers, and there is a much broader range of colours available. </p> <p>Give it another whiz once the colour and flavour is added, and you\u2019re good to go. For a really primo result, make sure your cake is nice and cold (sit it in the fridge in Glad Wrap for a few hours), and do a crumb coat if you want a tidy, Pinterest finish. This icing will pipe well, but it\u2019s hard to go past the classic \u201cstucco\u201d finish: pipe the icing on with a plain nozzle (a cut corner of a big Snap Lock bag will do), then use an offset spatula to smooth the icing into petal or fan shapes. This can look really great if you\u2019re blending different colours of icing together.</p> <p>Finally, if you\u2019ve finished all of this earlier than 2:30am, make yourself a cup of tea and bask in your handiwork.</p>",

Gjurovski always ignored him.</p> <p>\u201cOne day, when I drive past, I want to look around and say to my grandchildren, \u2018this place is still going.

In love with the job and with the people.\u201d</p> <p>Zarogiannis and Gjurovski are not outliers. According to a survey by the Australian Catholic University, workers in Victoria\u2019s automotive industry averaged 50 years of age and 19 years with the same company. Were it not for the shutdown, they would stay with Ford until retirement. Of the 67% who said they intended to keep working, survey author Dr Tom Barnes said, about half said they wanted to keep working in the same field.</p> <p>That field is rapidly clearing. When Zarogiannis retired in 2008, Mitsubishi had just ceased production at its South Australian plant. Since then General Motors/Holden and Toyota have announced they would follow Ford in moving production offshore. Both will have closed their Australian factories by the end of 2017.</p> <p>Of the 409 people surveyed, Barnes said, 87% had not yet tried to find a new job even though 49% expected to be made redundant.</p> <p>\u201cSome of them have been to some extent institutionalised, and some of them will struggle with a working environment that is different to that,\u201d he said. </p> <p>A similar study by Flinders University of Mitsubishi workers 18 months after the closure of its Adelaide factory found high levels of job instability, with 38% having been through two or more jobs in the previous year.</p> <p>Workers from Ford are expected to fare better. They will leave with an average payout of $150,000, equivalent to two year\u2019s pay, and be connected to a job placement company that in 2014 had a 100% success rate in placing people made forcibly redundant from the company. They have been offered literacy and numeracy classes, been bussed to job fairs, and been connected to training opportunities in the industry of their choice.</p> <p>More than half of those made redundant have taken some form of training, a Ford spokeswoman said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some people, they are never going to find a secure job like Ford</p> <footer> <cite>Andreas Zarogianni</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI have seen good and bad examples of [car companies managing redundancies], and this is the best,\u201d Dave Smith, the national secretary of the AMWU\u2019s vehicle division, told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey will come out job-ready.\u201d</p> <p>There is still work in manufacturing near Broadmeadows, particularly in local caravan-building businesses, but the hourly rate is two-thirds the $30 to $33 paid at Ford. The famously good conditions that inspired lifelong loyalty from blue-collar workers are not matched outside the car industry and, with the exception of the 160 redeployed to Ford\u2019s research and development division, which will continue to employ 1,500 people in Australia, those jobs are no longer available. </p> <p>In a sign of how much the automotive industry has shrunk, Ford Australia said its 2,000 employees across its remaining Australian divisions would make it the biggest automotive employer in the country by the end of 2017.</p> <p>\u201cWe also are investing more locally in R&amp;D than any other automaker \u2013 $300m this year alone \u2013 in advanced products and testing facilities across Australia,\u201d a spokeswoman said, adding Australia was \u201cone of Ford\u2019s global product development hubs\u201d.<br></p> <p>In Geelong, where Ford is the latest in a string of major employers to shut its doors, finding a work locally \u201cbecomes very difficult,\u201d Smith said.</p> <p>Both suburbs already have higher than average unemployment: Broadmeadows, at 22%, has the highest jobless rate in Victoria.</p> <p>Without the ready availability of jobs, Local MP Maria Vamvakinou said, new arrivals to Australia were denied the opportunity that earlier generations of migrants, including her parents, had to rapidly establish themselves and settle in.</p> <p>\u201cWhen something like this goes, you can\u2019t get it back again,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The emotional impact of losing the car industry was just beginning to be felt, Smith said.</p> <p>Ford brought in workers from mental health agency Beyond Blue and the union has opened its counselling hotline, but the stress of feeling an industry that has shaped identities and forged social networks has abandoned Australia can have fatal consequences.</p> <p>The Mitsubishi study found respondents had higher levels of mental stress and depressive symptoms than the general population of Adelaide, and at least one reported suicidal thoughts.</p> <p>Smith has already been to one funeral of a union member made redundant by another car industry player this year.</p> <p>The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, speaking at Broadmeadows on Thursday, said the closure of the Ford plant was \u201cunimaginable\u201d and accused the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, of not doing enough to protect the jobs of blue-collar workers. </p> <p>Smith lobbed the blame back further to the 2005 free trade agreement with Thailand and trade agreements with countries like the United States, which he said allowed free imports to Australia while Australian exports were met with a wall of protectionist policies. \u201cThat\u2019s not free trade, that\u2019s just bullshit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Last year the Coalition government, then led by Tony Abbott,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/10/coalition-reverses-500m-cut-to-taxpayer-assistance-to-auto-industry\"> backflipped on a plan to axe $500m from an industry assistance scheme</a> after it was argued doing so could affect the components industry, which has not yet pulled out of Australia.

  "<p>The Irish authorities have conducted a series of raids on fishing vessels in ports around the country as part of an investigation into the use of undocumented migrant workers.</p> <p>The Irish police, the Gardai, declined to comment on the operation, saying it was not yet complete. But it is understood from local sources that officers from its immigration unit, together with the Irish navy, the Workplace Relations Commission and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners targeted trawlers in Castletownbere, in County Cork, and Howth in Dublin on Wednesday. They moved on to other key fishing ports on Thursday.</p> <p>The Guardian understands the operation was undertaken as part of the Santa Marta project \u2013 the initiative led by the pope to tackle human trafficking and modern-day slavery. The project has made the exploitation of migrants in the global fishing sector one of its priorities. Local media reported that the raid teams were focusing on the routes used by Asian and African migrant fishermen to enter Ireland. </p> <p> An <a href=\"http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/publications/2015/TaskForceReport141215.pdf\">emergency taskforce</a> was set up by the Irish government last year to tackle the illegal employment of Asian and African migrants in its fleet. The government said in February it would issue up to 500 specially created work permits for fishermen from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) after allegations that they were being exploited as cheap labour.</p> <p>Senior figures in the industry had predicted that at least 1,000 work permits would be needed to ensure the protection of all non-EEA fishermen working in the Irish fleet. Only some 160 permits had been applied for by the scheme\u2019s deadline.</p> <p>Sources said the operation this week was also aimed at checking whether the permit scheme was working. The fishermen\u2019s union, the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation (ITF), welcomed the police checks, saying its own port visits in recent months suggested some boat owners were still using undocumented labour and refusing to apply for permits for their workers.</p> <p>The permit scheme requires owners to register, provide a solicitor-backed contract to workers, and pay the legal minimum wage. ITF\u2019s Ireland coordinator, Ken Fleming, said strong enforcement action was needed \u201cto end the widespread abuse of vulnerable fishers by unscrupulous employers\u201d.</p> <p>Several Filipino workers have used the scheme to regularise their position after years of working in the state illegally. They told us how happy they were to be properly documented and free to visit their families back home and return to work.</p> <p>However, migrant support groups expressed concern that the raids were focused on immigration breaches rather than labour exploitation. The Migrant Rights Centre Ireland said it has been contacted by several fishermen who had been put on notice to report to immigration authorities following the raids. \u201cNo one asked them about their employment conditions or checked for human trafficking. They are targeting those we most need to help rather than unscrupulous owners,\u201d said Gr\u00e1inne O\u2019Toole, an MRCI coordinator. </p>",
  "<p>The old Labour party HQ used to be in my parish, on the Walworth Road, just by Elephant and Castle in London. In 1997, Tony Blair moved the centre of operations into a swanky glass tower on Millbank. And from then on Labour began to lose touch with the communities it was set up to serve.</p> <p>Had it remained on Walworth Road the party would have witnessed, right across the street, how the forces of international finance have pushed out ordinary people and destroyed their communities. The postwar Heygate estate is no longer, and shiny new flats are going up that local people will never be able to afford, even at the comically misnamed \u201caffordable housing\u201d rates. Indeed, the very idea of local people no longer implies a longstanding connection. Most of those who were here for generations have gone, priced out. New people come and go all the time. The old Labour HQ is now a backpackers\u2019 hostel. What was once a thick community has become a thin community.</p> <p>A thick community is one with a high degree of social solidarity and a low degree of diversity. This is the sort of community where people are similar in language and culture, and where, as a consequence, there is a high degree of trust among people. It\u2019s a relatively stable place \u2013 not a lot of coming and going. You grow up where your parents grew up. You die near where you were born. People leave their back doors open and know their neighbours\u2019 business. The best thing about a thick society is that people look after each other and have a high degree of civic pride. The worst is that it\u2019s often not good at dealing with difference, or with outsiders.</p> <p>A thin community is one with a high degree of diversity and a low degree of social solidarity. In this community (which often isn\u2019t really much of a community at all) you can be as different as you like. Nobody cares. People come and go all the time \u2013 \u201ccitizens of the world but citizens of nowhere\u201d, to paraphrase Theresa May. You don\u2019t always have much in common with people living next door, and often you don\u2019t even know their names. You shop online. Loneliness can be a problem. But&#xa0;diversity is celebrated.</p> <p>Generally, big business likes thin societies, because they represent a fluid labour market. Lacking many of the social ties of the thick community, they are more difficult to unionise. Thin communities don\u2019t strike. They sign online petitions and complain on Twitter. The thinnest sort of community is the online community, where you have friends you have never even met.</p> <p>Since the 1960s we have been getting thinner and thinner. Much of that is to be celebrated. The old inward-looking Little Englander mentality, with its bad food and curtain-twitching moralism, has been transformed by the energy of diversity and difference, by immigration. Nowhere has benefited more from this than south London. I&#xa0;must have one of the most multicultural congregations in Britain, and I love it. But in church we are held together by a common story, a common faith. This glue binds a group of otherwise different people, making church an interesting political model of combining diversity and togetherness \u2013 Benedictine hospitality for all with jollof rice, difference and solidarity.</p> <p>Elsewhere, however, difference creates huge gaps in the social fabric, with many people now unconnected to each other, the rich in their gated communities in the sky and poor youth sitting around on the estates smoking weed. As the thick society has gradually thinned out, it is the elderly who pay the price. People don\u2019t visit as much as they used to. We know each other less and less.</p> <p>Brexit and the new mood in politics is misunderstood as a hostility to outsiders, though it is easily purloined by racists. Rather, it is a cry for community, for togetherness, for the local, for mutuality, for social solidarity. Theresa May, the vicar\u2019s daughter, wants to find all this in a return to the past. That\u2019s the wrong answer. But at least she\u2019s answering the right question. We are still looking for a new \u2013 doubtless very different \u2013 St Benedict.</p>",

But it might be useful to enlarge the understanding of education that is being discussed. Yes, graduates are more likely to vote in ways that are identified with left/liberal politics but there is a bigger question about the experience, as much as that of success within it, of education that demands examination. In the past 20 years everyone at any stage of education in the UK has been taught within a context of rigorous forms of measurement, in which lines between success and failure are increasingly visible and important. At the same time the links between the education system and the often poorly and narrowly conceived demands of the economy have become ever more explicit \u2013 so much so that to \u201cfail\u201d in education carries with it a&#xa0;social message of both collective and individual irrelevance. These relationships are becoming increasingly clear to millions of people, as are the more minimal gains that some forms of education can provide. In all, the degradation of the purpose of education carries with it a resistance to it and to the views of those most closely identified with it.<br><strong>Mary Evans</strong><br><em>Canterbury</em></p> <p>\u2022 I totally concur with Brian Barder\u2019s analysis (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/theresa-may-has-shot-herself-in-the-foot-with-the-brexit-starting-gun\" title=\"\">May shoots herself in the foot with Brexit trigger</a>, Letters, 5 October).

But I never saw anyone like me in them; so I decided to find a story to erode the excuses for me not doing one.\u201d He said that, although accepting the rejection of his outline on numerous occasions, the reason he was given he found \u201ctroubling\u201d \u2013 primarily the suggestion that audiences would only be comfortable with films about historical events they were already familiar with, and could \u201crevisit\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIf my history has never been visited, where does that put me? You are writing me out of this country\u2019s history - and that\u2019s unacceptable ... As someone of Nigerian descent, as a proud African, as well as a very proud Brit, I know that black people\u2019s history in the UK did not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/23/immigration-windrush-west-indians-jamaica-britain\">start with the Windrush</a>. We have been here for centuries.\u201d</p> <p>The symposium also heard repeated calls for radical changes to hiring practices in the British film industry, particularly among executives and commissioners. Oyelowo said: \u201cThe only way we are going to get diversity is if the demographics of the decision-makers change... The odd token bone thrown is not going to do it. Don\u2019t pat yourself on the back because you made that black drama; that\u2019s not diversity.

BFI Creative Director Heather Stewart presented the results of a data analysis of the last ten years of British film, which showed that despite superficially heartening figures suggesting that 13% of British films during the period contained at least one black actor in a leading role (compared to<a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/ethnicity/articles/ethnicityandnationalidentityinenglandandwales/2012-12-11\"> 3% of the UK population</a>), the roles were clustered around a small number of films \u2013 over half being contained in just 47 films (out of 1172 films in total). The total also includes notionally British-qualifying co-productions as Selma and 12 Years a Slave. The most prolific black British actor was Noel Clarke, who spoke on one of the panels and took the opportunity to point out that none of his films had been included in the Black Star programme. Oyelowo observed that it was only after he had moved to the US and achieved success in American films that work offers from the UK began to increase.</p> <p>Another speaker at the symposium, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/oct/19/mediacom-karen-blackett-talent-idris-elba\">MediaCom\u2019s Karen Blackett</a>, advocated the creation of an industry version of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooney_Rule\">\u201cRooney rule\u201d</a>, the US football directive that required ethnic minority candidates to be included on the shortlist for every senior job. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things I talk about a lot: can the Rooney rule be applied in a business context? ...

While he\u2019s sure some of the kids from Assumption ended up a block away, in Cook County jail, a classmate from private school became a senator.</p> <p>Earlier this year, in the middle of the debate about racial diversity at the Oscars, he told journalists it was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/12/michael-pena-media-overplays-police-brutality-usa-war-on-everyone\">\u201cchampagne problem\u201d</a>. Besides, he asked, why wasn\u2019t anyone mentioning that the director of The Revenant, Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, was Mexican?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m into looking at things from the other point of view,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if you look at who votes in the Oscars, mostly older Jewish guys, they\u2019re going to vote for stuff they relate to. Do they relate to NWA? I doubt it.\u201d He and his eight-year-old son never agree on music, he says, to which I say, but wait \u2013 you can\u2019t equate race and a difference in taste between generations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df6555174620d645de92e26d5ea11de655982753\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df6555174620d645de92e26d5ea11de655982753/0_23_2000_1199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pe\u00f1a with Jake Gyllenhall in End of Watch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pe\u00f1a with Jake Gyllenhall in End of Watch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/STUDIOCANAL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut it is generational.\u201d He mentions his son again. On Martin Luther King Day this year, he says, he explained to his son how African-Americans had been treated in the fight for civil rights. \u201cAnd he burst into tears and called me a liar. \u2018People wouldn\u2019t do that, Dad!\u2019 He\u2019s a bright kid, but the whole concept of racism is just bizarre to him. And with the Oscars, the voters get younger, and diversity gets better. I mean, I hear what people have said. I get it. I just want to be real about it.\u201d</p> <p>The one thing Pe\u00f1a never seems to talk about publicly is being a Scientologist, despite joining the church in 2000. But he says he\u2019s happy to tell his story. He took his first step out of concern about his drinking \u2013 \u201cI wasn\u2019t an alcoholic, but I was doing it too much\u201d \u2013 entering the detox programme Purification Rundown. \u201cAnd then there was the next thing, and the next thing. For me, it isn\u2019t religion like a belief; it\u2019s practical things you do.\u201d</p> <p>Was it also a way of navigating Hollywood as a young actor without connections? \u201cNot really.\u201d Instead, he credits another Scientology programme, Study Tech, with making him a more confident reader. \u201cWhich made me a better actor because I felt like it helped my understanding of scripts.\u201d</p> <p>But he must be aware of the endless controversy that surrounds the organisation? \u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t read that stuff.\u201d He\u2019s aware of it, though? \u201cYeah but \u2013 OK, imagine we\u2019re friends, you and me. Buddies. And there\u2019s a tabloid story about you.

The challenge he will face will be in reassuring banks that the UK is indeed still a safe-bet investment in a week that has seen the pound plunge to a new three decade low against the dollar on the prospect of \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit and businesses within the City of London warn that it could cost the city \u00a338 billion.

That could be compounded by a drop in physical exports, depending on the trade terms that Britain agrees with the rest of the world.</p> <p>Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, fears that the current account deficit will get even worse, pushing the pound down. He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There appear to be at least two reasons to believe that market fears about the consequences of a hard Brexit for continued large capital flows to the UK are not misplaced. The first is that, were the UK no longer to have ready access to Europe\u2019s single market for its exports, it would lose its attractiveness as a location for foreign companies\u2019 European investments. This was precisely the point that the Japanese government made at the September G20 meeting in China \u2013 when it publicly warned its UK counterparts of the likelihood that Japanese companies would relocate out of the UK in the event of a hard Brexit.</p> <p>The second reason is that a hard Brexit would almost certainly result in the loss of the \u2018financial passport\u2019 that City of London financial institutions currently enjoy for accessing the European market. A Financial Conduct Authority report in September suggested that as many as 5,500 UK financial firms could be affected by such a loss of passport rights. Major international banks including JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have warned that, if the City loses its financial passport, they will need to conduct at least part of their European operations from outside the UK.</p> <p>A key point that those in favour of a hard Brexit overlook is that a rapid drying up of foreign capital flows to the UK would have dire consequences for domestic living standards. A further currency dip would raise import costs and increase inflation. Moreover, there is a likelihood that domestic economic policy would need to be tightened \u2013 both to contain inflation and to make room for a large narrowing in the external current account deficit that foreigners would no longer be prepared to finance. UK households would be forced to reduce their consumption levels painfully, while businesses would be forced to cut back on their investment plans, to the detriment of future UK growth prospects.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.omfif.org/analysis/commentary/2016/october/on-the-road-to-a-sterling-crisis/\">More here</a></strong>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T09:49:48.678Z\">at 10.49am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f60476e4b08ebe3d55755f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T08:00:51.273Z\">9.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>HSBC has knocked up a handy chart showing some of the possible relationships that Britain could have with the EU (<em>and what it is giving up</em>):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MxSba/status/783933535459676160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lost in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash\">#Brexit</a> options?

  "<p>A gigantic overhaul of the world\u2019s buildings, public transport and energy infrastructure costing trillions of dollars is required if dangerous climate change is to be avoided, according to a major new report.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://newclimateeconomy.report/2016/\">study by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate</a>, which is co-chaired by prominent climate economist Lord Nicholas Stern, found that the world is expected to invest about $90tn in infrastructure over the next 15 years, requiring an \u201curgent\u201d shift to ensure that this money is spent on low-carbon, energy-efficient projects. Such smart investment over the next two or three years could help ameliorate the climate crisis, but \u201cthe window for making the right choices is narrow and closing fast\u201d. </p> <p>The report states that more than 60% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gases are associated with ageing power plants, roads, buildings, sanitation and other structures. Around 1,500 coal plants are estimated to already be in construction worldwide, which would send the world spiraling towards disastrous environmental changes. Carbon-heavy infrastructure \u201cliterally kills people by causing deadly respiratory illnesses, exacerbating road accidents and spreading unclean drinking water, among other hazards\u201d, the report reads.</p> <p>\u201cIt also puts pressure on land and natural resources, creating unsustainable burdens for future generations such as unproductive soils and runaway climate change.\u201d</p> <p>Stern said the next few years will be \u201ccritical\u201d to the future of sustainable development and the battle to ensure civilization isn\u2019t ravaged by heatwaves, extreme weather, sea level rise and other risks.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot continue with business as usual, which will lock in high-carbon infrastructure and create further congestion and pollution while choking off development opportunities, particularly for poor people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can and should invest in and build cities where we can move and breathe and be productive, while protecting the natural world that underpins our livelihoods.\u201d</p> <p>The financial system will need to be adjusted to make this change, the report finds. Subsidies to fossil fuels, currently totaling about $550bn a year, will need to be eliminated; better planning of projects will be required; and tools such as green bonds and green investment banking will need to be deployed.</p> <p>While it will cost slightly more to make infrastructure more sustainable, the upfront costs can be fully offset by efficiency gains and fuel savings. There are also health and societal benefits \u2013 greener energy infrastructure will reduce air pollution and provide greater access to energy to people in developing countries not connected to coal-fired power grids.</p> <p>Decisions made now in cities, which will house two-thirds of the global population by 2050, will influence the climate experienced later this century. To avoid gobbling up to a third of the remaining \u201ccarbon budget\u201d that remains before the world is pushed beyond a 2C (3.6F) temperature rise compared with pre-industrial times, cities need to properly plan for integrated public transport and energy-efficient buildings.</p> <p>The call comes after nations ratified the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement\">Paris climate accord</a>, which will come into force next month. Far steeper emissions cuts than countries have pledged so far will be required if the agreement\u2019s principal target \u2013 avoiding 2C of warming \u2013 is to be met.</p> <p>\u201cInvesting in sustainable infrastructure is essential to solve all the world\u2019s most pressing problems,\u201d said Felipe Calder\u00f3n, former president of Mexico and chair of the Global Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s key to reigniting global growth. It\u2019s key to reducing poverty. And it\u2019s key to meeting the Paris agreement.\u201d</p> <p>The Paris deal includes a promise to provide funding for nations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/15/marshall-islands-climate-change-springdale-arkansas\">such as low-lying islands, most vulnerable to climate change</a>. But many major economies have been slow to ramp up spending on their own mitigation and adaptation.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.ips-dc.org/report-combat-vs-climate/\">new report</a> by the thinktank Institute for Policy Studies found the US spends 28 times more on its military than it does on climate change. It estimates that the Obama administration has requested only $21bn for 2017 to transition to clean energy, compared with the $55bn required. These figures are estimates because the federal government stopped outlining its climate change budget in 2013.</p> <p>The Obama administration has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/21/presidential-memorandum-climate-change-and-national-security\">made climate change a key consideration in its military endeavors</a> but is also planning to spend $1tn to modernize its nuclear arsenal and a further $1.4tn on building F-35 fighter jets, according to the report. </p> <p>\u201cThough China has overtaken the US as the biggest producer of greenhouse gases, it is currently achieving a better balance between military and climate security spending,\u201d said Miriam Pemberton, lead author of the report.</p>",
  "<p>A suspected drug smuggler killed himself by leaping from the mast of a yacht loaded with cocaine worth \u00a318m as it was being searched by border force officers in the Isles of Scilly. An inquest jury ruled that Christiaan Woestenburg, whose boat had been towed into harbour by a lifeboat, took his own life. </p> <p>Netherlands-born Woestenburg, 62, told officers he was going to fetch some equipment to open a locked hatch on the yacht, Windrose. But he climbed up the 12-metre (40ft) mast of the yacht before jumping on to the granite quay of St Mary\u2019s harbour. The drugs were found hidden in the yacht\u2019s freshwater tank.</p> <p>The jury in Plymouth, Devon, was told that the 11-metre <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/03/suspected-drug-smuggler-christiaan-woestenburg-plunged-to-death-as-yacht-was-searched\">Windrose was in the Atlantic heading to the Netherlands when it suffered problems with its rigging and mast</a> 16 miles off Scilly.</p> <p>Woestenburg called out the St Mary\u2019s lifeboat on 16 June 2013 after three days without sleep. When the border force heard where the vessel was located, they sent a cutter to St Mary\u2019s and boarded the yacht to search for drugs.</p> <p>Woestenburg\u2019s younger brother, Otto, said his sibling was an experienced sailor who had made several transatlantic voyages. He said he had bought the yacht in Turkey in 2009 and had sailed to South America and the Dutch Caribbean several times.</p> <p>He said he had seen reports that a \u201cvery large\u201d amount of drugs was found on the boat, but he said: \u201cI cannot believe that he would have tried to smuggle drugs. His friends are in shock and disbelief. He was, in fact, anti-drugs.\u201d He said Woestenburg lived frugally and gave generously to charity.</p> <p>St Mary\u2019s assistant harbour master, Alan Hartwell, told the jury that the skipper had been at sea for 15 days and away from home for four years. Hartwell said: \u201cHe looked completely shattered. He said it was the worst trip he had.\u201d</p> <p>Home Office forensic pathologist Dr Russell Delaney said Woestenburg had been sailing from Portugal and was believed to be heading to Holland: \u201cHe was towed to the Isles of Scilly by the RNLI. The boat was tied to a mooring in the harbour. Border Force received some intelligence and the boat was boarded and searched.\u201d</p> <p>Delaney said the boat included a secured hatch below deck, and that the yachtsman had passed officers to return to the deck to fetch hydraulic equipment to open it. Once on deck, he climbed the mast. \u201cHe then jumped off the top and landed on the solid granite harbourside,\u201d said Delaney. An off-duty paramedic came to his aid and he was airlifted to Truro in Cornwall, where he was declared dead.</p> <p>Delaney said his postmortem revealed that the yachtsman died from head, chest and pelvic injuries that were consistent with a fall from height. He added: \u201cHe was immediately unconscious and unaware of what happened. The head injury was unsurvivable.\u201d There was no evidence that he had been forcefully restrained.</p> <p>Blood tests showed that Woestenburg was slightly over the drink-drive limit.

He\u2019s a composer, arranger, producer and programmer who plays keyboards, guitar, percussion and horns, and works with the fine American band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2013/sep/17/calexico-interview-joey-burns\">Calexico</a>. He may be based in Tucson, but his inspiration comes from south of a border that is not blocked by any walls. With <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/orkestamendoza.az/\">Orkesta Mendoza</a> he sets out to update and enliven the Latin big band tradition, mixing influences from Mexico and across Latin America with electronica, strings and unexpected bursts of western pop. He has a sometimes brash, widescreen style that would have impressed Phil Spector, but there is impressive variety in his exuberant approach. So he starts with stomping, brassy dance songs, slows down a little for a grand, piano-backed ballad and then changes direction again for Mapache, with its witty reference to 60s instrumental pop. Classy and enormous fun.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUGzPElHuuQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AUGzPElHuuQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>This past August <a href=\"https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/\">marked</a> 16 straight months of record-breaking high temperatures globally. The planet is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/03/global-temperature-climate-change-highest-115000-years\">hotter right now</a> than it has been in 115,000 years. Nasa makes very easy-to-understand videos that show the decrease in the polar ice caps in the Arctic Circle, which is warming <a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/2893850/nasa-releases-video-of-melting-polar-ice-caps/\">twice as fast</a> as the rest of the world. More than <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/science/climate-change-poll-pew.html?_r=0\">90%</a> of the world\u2019s climate scientists say that the planet is warming and human activity is the cause. </p> <p>Amazingly, lots of people still don\u2019t believe them. <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/many-more-republicans-now-believe-in-climate-change/\">Less than half</a> of all Republicans polled this year by Yale and George Mason universities think that the climate is changing at all.</p> <p>What is going with on with these people? Kirsti Jylha, a psychology professor at Sweden\u2019s Upsala University, recently <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/10/161004103313.htm\">published</a> a thesis in the scientific journal Personality and Individual Differences that sketches a profile of a standard climate change denier. Jylha\u2019s studies found that climate change denial correlates strongly with conservative political orientation, authoritarian attitudes and support for the status quo. </p> <p>Deniers tend to exhibit a low capacity for empathy and a high aptitude for dominance. They\u2019re predisposed to closed-mindedness and seeing the world in a hierarchical structure, and they avoid experiencing negative emotions. Perhaps not surprisingly, they are usually male.</p> <p>Since climate change denial hampers efforts towards the collective worldwide action scientists believe will be required to ward off the most catastrophic results of global warming, Jylha hopes that her work can lead to new routes of communication and cooperation.</p> <p>\u201cThe arguments used in the climate debate often revolve around giving up conveniences in life to help the environment or the poor or weak,\u201d Jylha told Science Daily. \u201cBut that is maybe not a convincing argument to someone who sees the world from a hierarchical viewpoint. It would perhaps be better to talk in other terms and describe how everyone will benefit from the measures instead of being affected by the consequences and that the measures don\u2019t have to be a threat to the current societal structure.\u201d</p> <p>In other words: how can we more effectively talk stubborn, closed-minded jerks into helping to solve (and/or, at the very least, stop worsening) the world\u2019s most dangerous problem? Following Jylha\u2019s lead, I\u2019ve come up with a few conversation starters, to use in the appropriate situations, custom-designed to ease the climate denier in your neighborhood into taking measures that might just do our imperilled planet some good. </p> <p>You notice the guy \u2013 pot-bellied, bad hair, fake tan, tiny fingers, we\u2019ll call him \u201cDonald\u201d \u2013 pulling his SUV out of his driveway to head into work. Try this: <em>hey Donald</em>, you mouth, indicating he should roll down his driver\u2019s side window. </p> <p>When he does, you go on. \u201cHave you ever considered car pooling? If you were to give a couple of your colleagues a ride to work in this huge car of yours, you could dominate conversation for the whole hourlong drive<em>.\u201d</em></p> <p>A week later, casually mention that you\u2019re thinking about buying a Prius. Suggest he consider getting one himself. \u201cA nice small car like that would make your tiny fingers look comparatively bigger on the steering wheel.\u201d</p> <p>One afternoon, when you see him out riding his lawnmower in the yard of his McMansion, ask about the dividing line between his property and that of his other neighbor, Mike. \u201cYou should plant some trees all along the fence,\u201d you might tell him. \u201cI suppose Mike might get his knickers all up in a bunch, if you were to do it, say, without consulting him first. But it <em>is </em>your property, and the law says that you can do whatever you want with it.\u201d</p> <p>Come summertime, ask him whether his wife and kids leave the air conditioning blasting all day. \u201cWho pays the bills in the family, Donald? Who gets to decide when the air conditioner goes on and off?\u201d</p> <p>Once football seasons starts, and he starts inviting friends over to watch football games in his \u201cman cave\u201d, appeal to his well-established competitive streak. \u201cWho can drink the most beer?\u201d you can ask. \u201cLet\u2019s make pyramids out of our empty cans! And make sure to keep them carefully separated from the non-recyclable garbage when it\u2019s time to clean up. So we can have an accurate count and see who\u2019s the best.\u201d</p> <p>After the beer drinking and can stacking, and counting and drunken, bare-chested push-ups in the middle of the cul-de-sac or whatever, Donald\u2019s liable to be dizzy and disoriented. Now\u2019s the time to get him to sign the petition in support of the wind farm being proposed in the fields next to the highway. Tell him that the mills are big giant \u201cprotection fans\u201d, designed to blow newcomers away from your town. \u201cIt\u2019ll be like a great big wall.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Twenty-one UK theatre companies are urging the government to act more quickly on the issue of refugee children with a legal right to enter the UK, and have offered free tickets as a gesture to welcome them.</p> <p>The theatres include the West Yorkshire Playhouse, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/national-theatre\">National Theatre</a>, the Royal Exchange Manchester, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/29/250-not-out-bristol-old-vic-prepares-to-celebrate-record-achievement\">Bristol Old Vic</a>, Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse, Chichester Festival Theatre, Bristol Old Vic and the Young Vic.</p> <p>They have written to the immigration minister Robert Goodwill urging him to speed up the process by which young people living in the refugee camp in Calais who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/02/child-refugees-calais-failed-by-britain\">legally entitled to join their families in the UK</a> can do so.</p> <p>The letter says: \u201cWe understand that there are currently 1,022 unaccompanied young children living alone in the \u2018Jungle\u2019 refugee and migrant camp in Calais. Around half of these children have the legal right to be reunited with their families in the UK under the terms of the Immigration Act 2016.</p> <p>\u201cAs the authorities prepare for the camp\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/01/child-refugees-despair-calais-camp-close\">demolition in the next three weeks</a>, we urge the British government to honour the legal commitment it has made to protect these children, to speed up the legal process in view of the impending eviction, and to do everything it can to ensure the protection of all unaccompanied children living in Calais before the demolition begins.\u201d</p> <p>The letter concedes that a trip to the theatre will not be the most urgent priority when the children arrive in the UK. \u201cNonetheless, we will all be delighted to welcome them and their families into our theatres across the country and to offer them seats to a show free of charge, in the belief that this is one small expression of the desire of millions of UK citizens to do whatever they can to welcome these vulnerable young people in a generous and open-hearted way,\u201d the letter says.</p> <p>The other theatres taking part are Battersea Arts Centre, Birmingham Repertory Theatre, Bush Theatre, Lyric Hammersmith, Nuffield Southampton, the Old Vic, Playground Entertainment, the Royal Court Theatre, the Royal Opera House, Sadler\u2019s Wells, Soho Theatre, Sonia Friedman Productions, Theatre Royal Stratford East and Unicorn Theatre.</p> <p>Many theatres work closely with refugee groups. In 2014 the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds became <a href=\"https://www.wyp.org.uk/about/creative-engagement/communities/theatre-of-sanctuary/\">the first \u201cTheatre of Sanctuary\u201d</a>, issuing a public statement enforcing its commitment to being a place of safety, hospitality and support for refugees and asylum seekers.</p>",
  "<p>The problems with referendums are well known: they reduce often complex questions to a binary choice; they are a demagogue\u2019s dream, allowing populists free rein to fan fears, distort realities and appeal to emotions; voters can see them as a chance to voice their unhappiness about something else entirely.</p> <p>And yet referendums are on the rise. In June, the EU referendum for Britain; last week, in Hungary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/hungarian-vote-on-refugees-will-not-take-place-suggest-first-poll-results\">a referendum concerning refugees and migrants</a>; in Colombia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/colombia-referendum-rejects-peace-deal-with-farc\">one about a peace deal to end the country\u2019s 50-year armed rebellion</a>; and this December Italians will be given a vote on constitutional reforms. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/why-colombians-voted-against-peace-farc-president-santos-better-deal\">Why Colombians voted against peace with the Farc | Isabel Hilton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As often as not referendums do not produce the result the politicians intend. So what explains their popularity?</p> <p>A sharp increase in referendums is typical in periods of change and political uncertainty, according to Matt Qvortrup, professor of applied political science at Coventry University and author of Referendums Around the World. He estimates that, from roughly 10 a year worldwide in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, the rate is now \u201capproaching 50 a year\u201d.</p> <p>Referendums were much in vogue after the French and Russian revolutions, in the aftermath of the second world war, and after the fall of communism, he said: \u201cWe see referendums when the political party system is in flux, when politicians feel unsure of who their supporters are and what they think.\u201d</p> <p>For politicians a referendum is \u201ca way of kicking an issue into the grass\u201d, a fairly safe means of resolving a problem that, in an election, might prove a major vote loser. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/08/trouble-with-democracy-david-runciman\">The trouble with democracy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A lost referendum is rarely fatal. Before David Cameron stepped down in the wake of the UK\u2019s Brexit vote, the last European prime minister to resign after ending up on the wrong side of a plebiscite was in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1972\">Norway</a>, in 1972.</p> <p>From the 70s to the 90s, Qvortrup said, politicians largely felt confident about who was voting for them and why. Large, mainstream parties of the centre left and right dominated the political scene and most voters trusted them to make decisions. In many countries that is no longer so; politics are becoming increasingly fragmented, and voters sceptical and disaffected.</p> <p>Research by S\u00f6ren<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>Holmberg, a Swedish academic, had shown that voters in the 1970s agreed with up to 90% of their chosen party\u2019s platform, Qvortrup said, whereas today that figure was 60%. Moreover, referendums are often confidence votes and statistics show the longer a party has been in power the less support it can expect in a plebiscite.</p> <p>Most voters do not want too much of a good thing. Having \u201chired\u201d politicians in much the same way as they hire an estate agency, Qvortrup suggested, the public expects their houses to be sold for them at the right price, without being constantly quizzed about the details.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/the-question-was-stupid-hungarians-on-the-refugee-referendum\">'The question was stupid': Hungarians on the refugee referendum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the recent return of the referendum may also fit with a move away from the \u201cpackage deal\u201d, he added. People, he said, were now more individualist than before: \u201cWe expect to be able to compile our own playlists, in politics too.\u201d </p> <p>All these factors help explain the disruptive votes in several recent referendums: in Britain and Colombia, where governments lost; and in Hungary, where although those who did vote overwhelmingly supported the government not enough voters turned out to make the referendum valid. </p> <p>Referendums should, Qvortrup said, be confined to really big questions, \u201cirreversible decisions that will really impact people\u2019s lives\u201d, and be held only in rare and exceptional circumstances. </p> <p>Otherwise, politicians should simply be bolder, present their really significant policies at elections, and accept the outcome as a mandate or a rejection. Referendums were \u201ckind of the chicken option\u201d, he said.</p>",
  "<p>A social media campaign at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, was successful in bringing the rapper Drake to the school \u2013 though few were around to actually see him.</p> <p>Drake stopped by Drake after his concert in Des Moines \u2013 decked out in <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/entertainment/2016/10/05/drake-story-behind-drake-university-swag/91616070/\">gear from the university</a>, including a varsity jacket and basketball jersey \u2013 at around 2.30am and began knocking on doors, according to local news station <a href=\"http://ktla.com/2016/10/05/lone-student-stays-awake-to-see-drake-at-drake/\">KTLA</a>. \u201cKappa Kappa Gamma I\u2019m outside your sorority house right now and you\u2019re all asleep,\u201d Drake said in a video on his Instagram.</p> <p>Ben Scott, a junior in Theta Chi fraternity, had just returned from Drake\u2019s concert and was still awake to answer the door when the rapper came calling. \u201cI think I was the only one that actually saw him and spoke to him which was phenomenal.

Nothing is clear except that it is all going to be a lot trickier to disengage from the EU than some foolish people said \u2013 and still say despite mounting evidence to the contrary.</p> <p>So my starting point is one of humility as I learn stuff I didn\u2019t known before. It\u2019s safe to say that some things will be better outside the EU, others worse, some sectors and individuals will thrive, others languish. The consequences of Britain\u2019s leap in the dark \u2013 37% of the total electorate voted Brexit by a very slender margin \u2013 are still largely unknown for all 28 members states. Only charlatans and romantics pretend otherwise.</p> <p>I like to quote one of Fleet St\u2019s most celebrated columnists at this point. In an article published by the Telegraph on May 12 2013 he wisely wrote:<strong><em> <br></em></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>If we left the EU, we would end this sterile debate and we would have to recognize that most of our problems are not caused by Brussels, but by chronic British short termism, inadequate management, sloth, low skills, a culture of easy gratification and underinvestment in both human and physical capital and infrastructure.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Did Boris Johnson believe what he wrote then? It\u2019s never easy to tell when the man \u201cmost trusted\u201d by Brexit voters opens his mouth. But he was right. Whatever you regard as Britain\u2019s big mistakes in recent decades \u2013 poor bank regulation, Iraq, privatization, PFI, the failure to build new runways or HS2 \u2013 have been our own mistakes. Europe has mostly been the scapegoat.</p> <p>That is my chief fear for the future. However much \u201csovereignty\u201d ( let alone cash) we get back from Brussels in reality, however successful and sophisticated a deal we negotiate with generous-spirited EU leaders and new trading partners, it is all going to take a lot of time and effort. The City\u2019s insurance, for which the single market never worked well, will adapt and survive. Banks, UK tourism and farming may flourish while those Japanese car makers desert Sunderland for somewhere cheaper inside the Eurozone. Or they may not.<br></p> <p>But the process is bound to disappoint many people, Brexit voters as well as Remainers, because Brexit was oversold as a panacea. With no EU whipping boy to blame for things which were actually our own fault \u2013 eh, Boris !! \u2013 the search will start for new scapegoats ( some of them very old ones too). Populist politicians and cynical newspapers will encourage it to mask the failure of their predictions. Some people claim to detect such stirrings in this week\u2019s Tory conference speeches.</p> <p>I think that\u2019s premature and hope they\u2019re wrong. I also hope the Brexit optimists are triumphantly vindicated in their vision of a prosperous new Britain. But, like Boris before his Brexit flip flop, I have my doubts.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f64a00e4b03b0685c082f2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T12:57:09.535Z\">1.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Thanks everyone</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We will be wrapping up the debate in the next four minutes, but we welcome any final comments and remarks.</p> <p>We will keep comments open until 2.15pm</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f64981e4b03b0685c082ef\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/james-walsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T12:56:21.776Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Brexit is a disaster waiting to happen'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A view from Nigel Stern, who runs a design agency in London:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The biggest impact will hiring staff with the right skills.

The effect of Brexit on Europe\u2019s perception of Britain as a country is very negative - and the announcements from the Tory party conference will only reinforce the impression that Britain is not opening up for business. In fact, the very reverse: closing down for business and pursuing policies of discrimination against foreigners, especially from Europe. </p> <p>The level of discrimination against immigrants from Europe is most definitely alienating what should be Britain\u2019s closest friends. As someone with a slight foreign accent I no longer feel entirely safe in this country. A hard Brexit would be a disaster for me - as many books go abroad and the customs paperwork would add a considerable workload as well as extra costs in the case of more valuable books. There literally is not a single advantage to be derived from Brexit except for the lower pound, which could have been lowered by other means which would have done far less damage to Britain\u2019s economy and society.

Look at the effect the Iraq war had on French products in the U.S when they went ( rightfully ) against the Iraq war.... Everything Farage and Boris do is making it far easier for the E.U to take a tough stance in negotiations with support from their people. Especially when they act so arrogantly by saying the E.U has too much to lose and will have to take any deal we offer. </p> <p>Brexiters seem to have no idea on how politics will effect us more than anything else.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f63399e4b0352b9d54c3d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/james-walsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T11:25:07.105Z\">12.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Comments are open below the line and our debate is underway. </p> <p>Kicking us off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/oct/06/will-britains-exit-from-the-eu-be-bad-for-business-live-debate?page=with:block-57f61496e4b0e2a2a25af7d8#block-57f61496e4b0e2a2a25af7d8\">from the form</a> is a small business owner in the south east of England, who has noted a definite impact of the vote:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve already seen an impact in car buying attitudes in the months following the referendum.

  "<p>Some years ago I joined a delegation of Labour MPs to the European parliament. A member of the EU commission gave us some of his valuable time. \u201cThe British people are just going to have to learn to put up with freedom of movement,\u201d he said as he sat down.</p> <p>Everyone around me agreed. I remember thinking that the British people didn\u2019t have to put up with anything, not their politicians and certainly not their bureaucrats. But I said nothing. As a recently elected MP I did not have the confidence to interrupt the consensus. And besides, like all my colleagues, I supported freedom of movement.</p> <p>That consensus is now breaking down. Earlier in the summer I wrote about the fears of many Jeremy Corbyn supporters that without him Labour would race not simply to the right but to a fusion of Blairite managerialism and Farage populism.</p> <p>I thought those fears unjustified, a Corbynista version of <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/08/labour-mp-any-other-job-jeremy-corbyn-would-have-faced-industrial-tribunal\" title=\"\">Project Fear</a>. But some are now arguing that, like Brexit, Project Fear is becoming Project Fact as Labour MPs argue for the party to walk away from freedom of movement and the home secretary proposes lists of \u201cforeign\u201d employees.</p> <p>It\u2019s not only in the UK. Across Europe the rise of the right has made comrades question the appetite for freedom of movement. While the tone and actual proposals differ, the message is often similar. The white working class has been ignored for too long. We need to check our privilege and check out of Europe.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know that much about privilege. I grew up like the white working class, with one obvious difference: I wasn\u2019t white. I\u2019m certainly in a position of immense privilege now, and that gives me a voice when it comes to my values, but it did not help form them. The white working class helped form my values.</p> <p>On North Kenton council estate, where I grew up, racism was a daily occurrence that marked me for life. But I also benefited from a huge amount of support from working-class friends, families and teachers. I learned abiding and entrenched views on fairness, the value of labour and the importance of solidarity. The values that caused Abraham Lincoln to thank \u201cthe working men of Manchester\u201d for their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2013/feb/04/lincoln-oscars-manchester-cotton-abraham\" title=\"\">solidarity against slavery</a>. The values that formed both the co-operative movement and the fair trade movement.</p> <p>When I was selected as candidate for Newcastle Central I said there was no doorstep in the city where I would not go. If someone was voting BNP or Ukip, I would listen and find out why. I learned that we have a huge job to do to regain the trust of many who have been betrayed by rising inequality, reduced demand for traditional skills and increased competition for certain types of work. There is real and justified anger at that betrayal.</p> <p>I can see that such anger might incline some comrades towards if not a flirtation with xenophobia then at least a wary two-step (\u201cLook, we\u2019re not touching, just moving to the mood music\u201d). They hope in so doing to shore up Labour\u2019s position as the party that speaks for the working class, the same reasoning that led the party to abstain on the second reading of the welfare bill last year. This latest dance is likely to be just as successful, but the impact on our reputation would be even worse.</p> <p>There are certainly arguments to be had about freedom of movement of people versus freedom of movement of exploitation and welfare. And there is much to be said for knowing what happens at our borders, and who comes in to the country and who is leaving it.</p> <p>But these arguments must be made from a position of strong support for free movement of people, the jobs it brings through access to the European market and the value those people add to our economy and our society. Without the free movement of people, the free movement of goods and capital isolates and dehumanises us, free trade without free people both commoditises our experience and makes us less resilient to global forces of change.</p> <p>This is toxic territory. It does not lend itself to \u201ctriangulation\u201d \u2013 particularly by those who have little familiarity with the working class they claim to represent. For too many, the working-class experience is an essay in anthropology, not a reality to be reflected \u2013 far less challenged or questioned.</p> <p>And even if we could triangulate it to try to win more votes, we should not. Labour party members have for the second time overwhelmingly demonstrated they want authenticity. On this subject the Tories can authentically outplay us every time, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\" title=\"\">this week has shown</a>.</p> <p>Ultimately no matter how many soundbites we drop, Labour is not going to be believed as the party that is tough on immigration. We can be believed as the party that is tough on the negative consequences of migration. But if we let our values dance to the tune of xenophobia, we will not be believed on anything.</p>",

  "<h2><strong>Winning tip: Vancouver, Canada</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Cypress Mountain</strong> is only a 30-minute car trip from downtown Vancouver and offers an amazing variety of groomed runs, moguls and backcountry options. It\u2019s as good a place to learn as it is to push your limits. One of the best things about the mountain is its proximity to the city. Head up in the evening for some jaw-dropping night skiing with the city lights below. There\u2019s plenty of great apr\u00e8s-ski in the lovely lodge bars and you have the benefit of being able to stay in Vancouver itself, not in an expensive resort. It\u2019s also a fantastic day out for families, offering tubing, sledging and other snowy activities. Cypress also has a Nordic Area dedicated to cross-country skiing and snowshoeing, again offering incredible views of the vast mountain ranges north of Vancouver. This a perfect option for those seeking the comforts of a cosmopolitan city broken up by some alpine adventure.<br>\u2022 <em>Day pass \u00a323 adult, \u00a317 junior, </em><a href=\"http://cypressmountain.com/\"><em>cypressmountain.com</em></a><br><strong>Caroline King</strong></p> <h2><strong>Almaty, Kazakhstan</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5eceef6f8b0c2e23504c39557e0b55a57a065261\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eceef6f8b0c2e23504c39557e0b55a57a065261/0_312_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medeo (Medeu) in Almaty, Kazakhstan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>From the country\u2019s largest city, Almaty, the <strong>Shymbulak</strong> ski slopes are on your doorstep and everything is easy and reasonably priced. The resort is small, but there were no queues at any point. From the gondola at Medeu to the toilets and lockers at the slopes, the services are all fine. It\u2019s not a resort for novices though: the main long slopes are red and there are only a few short blues. At 4pm the slopes are in the shade and get icy. It\u2019s well worth going over to the other side of the mountain, for glacier views, and three short blue slopes. Of course, flying to Kazakhstan is expensive but the skiing can be made very cheap by renting gear from <a href=\"http://visitalmaty.kz/z5/\">Extremal</a> on the corner of Dostyk and Al Ferabi streets in Almaty: it\u2019s half the price of the slopes rental place.

There is some off piste, but advanced skiers may be bored. The real joy of Bansko is its social potential \u2013 drinks and meals are very cheap, even on the slopes. It\u2019s simple to arrange accommodation (\u00a310-40pppn depending on whether you want a shared apartment or full-board hotel); flights to Sofia are available from budget airlines and transfers can be arranged online. Once in the resort, a lift pass can be purchased from the gondola station and equipment hire and lessons arranged through a nearby shop (Bansko Sport are very friendly and helpful).

Everyone welcomes Jeremy Hunt\u2019s announcement of 1,500 more medical school places by 2018. When we need more doctors, it makes no sense to turn away so many able applicants. Though somehow it has slipped Hunt\u2019s memory that his government cut medical training places by 2% in 2012, and only last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/21/george-osborne-considers-axeing-student-nurse-bursaries\" title=\"\">cut the Health Education England budget</a> for training.</p> <p>The puzzle is why anyone would insult the one third of NHS doctors born abroad by suggesting they are only \u201cinterim\u201d, as May said. We need both homegrown and foreign staff, all we can find, and scour the world for more. Since the Brexit vote agencies are struggling to recruit nurses and doctors abroad.

And it\u2019s only necessary because of all he has done to alienate junior doctors instead of wooing them to stay for life.

  "<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I see the F train\u2019s twin headlights blooming into the station.<br>When I close my eyes, its warm wind sweeps hair from my face,<br>the way my grandmother did with her hands, to see my eyes.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The feeling created by these words, from American poet Erika Meitner\u2019s 2010 poetry collection Ideal Cities, will ring familiar to nearly all who live the urban experience. But the relief of seeing a pair of headlights peek through the tunnel, or the sensation of the hot air of a passing train, are so mundane they can often go uncelebrated save for a fleeting moment. </p> <p>Poetry like Meitner\u2019s can give us a space to sing the praises and frustrations of the cities we live in. But can it actually help us make those cities better? Can poetry be a way to experience and understand our environment more richly?</p> <p>Many people\u2019s first formal interaction with poetry \u2013 beyond nursery rhymes, at least \u2013 tends to be centred on the Romantic-era poets such as Blake, Keats, Wordsworth or Shelley. This particular tradition <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/the-romantics\">is known for</a> being rooted in a celebration of the beauty of the natural world, typified in classics such as Keats\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/106/255.html\">Ode to Autumn</a><em> </em>(\u201cWhile barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day / And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue\u201d), and Shelley\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/45134\">Ode to the West Wind</a><em>:</em> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams<br>The blue Mediterranean, where he lay<br>Lull\u2019d by the coil of his crystalline streams\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>So perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that over time, poetry has been less associated with train tracks, smog, and bridges and more with brooks, brambles, and fields. </p> <p>However, east London-based poet Tom Chivers, whose work focuses heavily on the urban experience and who has made a series of poetic audio walks down London\u2019s lost rivers, says that emphasis is misplaced. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is this energy and aggression and speed in a city that lends itself to poetry</p> <footer> <cite>Tom Chivers</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe city resists nostalgic forms of poetry that have been handed down to us in various traditions,\u201d Chivers says. \u201cThere is this energy and aggression and speed in a city that lends itself to poetry.

He writes in his poem <a href=\"http://www.inuaellams.com/news/blog/wordart/2010/directions\">Directions</a><em>:</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You know the wild bushes at the back of the flat, the ones that scrape the kitchen window the ones that struggle for soil or water, and fail where the train tracks scar the ground?</p> </blockquote> <p>He runs walking poetry workshops with the \u201cexperiential travel\u201d company SideStory, during which anyone can try turning their attention to the poetic undercurrent of the city. At the Southbank Centre\u2019s Poetry Library, which houses the most comprehensive collection of poetry in the UK, Ellams tells me that \u201cpoems are 3D portraits of the world using as few words as possible\u201d. A shortcut to creating that portrait, he says, is by focusing on the senses.</p> <p>This shift in focus from the cerebral to the physical feels particularly apt in the urban setting, where we are bombarded with all manner of sensory assaults \u2013 from unsavoury fumes to dewy morning light and the smell of croissants. Taken as a whole, this can be overwhelming; but embraced intentionally, with a kind of poetic mindfulness, these common threads of the urban experience can take on a whole new meaning. </p> <p>One urban poetic tradition that revels in that act of noticing is that of the <a href=\"http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2013/10/17/in-praise-of-the-flaneur/\">fl\u00e2neur, or the 19th-century wanderer</a>, personified by the French poet Charles Baudelaire, who once wistfully wrote: \u201cThe form of a city changes faster, alas, than the human heart.\u201d In her book about the subversive tradition of female fl\u00e2neurs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/25/flaneuse-women-walk-city-paris-new-york-tokyo-venice-london-review-lauren-elkin\">Flaneuse</a>, Lauren Elkin writes of the way Virginia Woolf practiced this art in her Bloomsbury neighbourhood:</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The form of a city changes faster, alas, than the human heart</p> <footer> <cite>Charles Baudelaire</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWoolf reminds us that there is something physically absorbing that keys us into the throb of the city, transformed by the quality of the light, of the air, of the road \u2026 The city, [Woolf] wrote in her diary in 1928, was forever \u2018attract[ing], stimulat[ing]\u2019 her, giving her \u2018a play and a story and a poem\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd13b5815ffa06482c3c4044fc47af72a0fdbae5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd13b5815ffa06482c3c4044fc47af72a0fdbae5/0_148_3300_1981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eminem rap battle 8 mile\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hip-hop lyrics are a distinct kind of urban poetry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ellams echoes this sentiment. \u201cSo much of the urban experience is going somewhere,\u201d he says. \u201cMeandering is not celebrated.\u201d By slowing down, we notice the kinds of poetic details that can help us transcend the normal thrum of daily life. </p> <p>The 18th-century poet Alexander Pope was a practitioner of a slightly more provocative kind of urban poetry \u2013 he gained notoriety for his habit of cussing and satirising his adversaries in verse.

Hip-hop lyrics are a distinctly urban kind of poetry that has exploded in the past 30 years, rising mainly from the experience of black Americans in cities but increasingly to be found in metropolises worldwide. Though the line between rap and poetry depends heavily on who you ask (linguist, literary critic, poet), and Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s declaration that TS Elliot <a href=\"http://gawker.com/an-old-white-man-invented-rap-claims-an-old-white-man-1601184355\">invented rap</a> is even more tin-eared than his music, it is not hard to see the same contemplative urban spirit in Eminem\u2019s film 8 Mile as in some of the best classic urban poetry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/22/female-rappers-mexico-city-violence-against-women\">Female rappers take a stand in Mexico's capital of violence against women</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another successful project similarly proves that urban poetry needn\u2019t be intimidating or elitist, but simply accessible: <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/culture-and-heritage/poems-on-the-underground\">Poems on the Underground</a>, a public art project funded by the Arts Council and now celebrating its 30th year, has seen 600 poems grace the inside carriages of the Tube and been emulated from New York to Shanghai. \u201cIt\u2019s a little embarrassing to have created a public art project that is so widely liked,\u201d says Judith Chernaik, co-creator and curator. </p> <p>\u201cThe tradition of poetry appearing in parks, in buildings \u2013 this has gone on a long time. There was nothing original about [our project] except that it was on the Tube,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, in such a commercialised world, I think there\u2019s a kind of implicit pleasure in the poems just being there, not doing anything to you, and not forcing you to do anything.

Without that it makes it more difficult for people to come back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be going back just to kill myself eating high table dinners at a college,\u201d he added. \u201cThe ERC made it much more attractive.\u201d</p> <p>Haldane called for scientists to be given a protected status for visas, although he told the Guardian that he did not share some scientists\u2019 broader fears about a potential future clampdown on immigration in Britain. \u201cThere is clearly a need to be able to attract the top scientists and it goes without saying that complicated paperwork is going to put people off,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A second scientist, Sir Fraser Stoddart, the Scottish chemist who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/05/nobel-prize-chemistry-2016-jean-pierre-sauvage-jean-pierre-sauvage-bernard-feringa-nano-machines\">awarded the Nobel prize on Wednesday</a>, said that government plans to crackdown on immigration could be a deterrent for the best British scientists as well as those from abroad. \u201cI am very disturbed by the talk coming out of the UK at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything that stops the free movement of people is a big negative for science.\u201d</p> <p>He said that he has even advised young scientists to consider looking outside the UK in the future, due to fears that British science may enter a period of decline.</p> <p>\u201cI would have a plan B if I was a young scientist in Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be good news for British science. There are a lot of things that, particularly as a Scottish person, you can\u2019t make your mind up about. But there\u2019s no doubt in my mind about this. I do feel very strongly about it.\u201d</p> <p>Haldane\u2019s move the US in the 1980s was prompted by the Thatcher government squeezing funding for curiousity-driven scientific research. \u201cThere was a depressing atmosphere in British science at the time because of stupid government ideas that one should do something \u2018useful\u2019,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThey wanted to fund research into turbulence in North Sea gas pipes - an idea that I found pretty depressing.\u201d</p> <p>Stoddart moved from Birmingham to the University of California Los Angeles in 1997, where he succeeded a past Nobel laureate, Donald Cram, in a prestigious chemistry professorship.</p> <p>In her conference speech in Birmingham on Wednesday, the prime minister cited Britain\u2019s Nobel successes in science as a source of national pride. \u201c[Britain is] a successful country - small in size but large in stature - that with less than 1% of the world\u2019s population boasts more Nobel laureates than any country outside the United States\u2026 with three more added again just yesterday \u2013 two of whom worked here in this great city.\u201d</p> <p>UK universities currently get about \u00a31.2 billion research funding a year from the EU. Switzerland and Israel both \u201cbuy in\u201d to allow their scientists access to ERC grants, but Swiss participation is in jeopardy because of proposals to limit free movement of EU citizens into the country.<br></p> <p>Stoddart said that in his own research group, at Northwestern University, Illinois, he had scientists and students from more than a dozen different countries. \u201cWe get on extremely well regardless of background,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have this unity based on shared pursuit of science.\u201d<br></p> <p>Stoddart said that early in his career, at Sheffield University, he faced some criticism for recruiting from abroad. \u201cI got colleagues saying \u2018Don\u2019t you know that our people are better?\u2019\u201d he said. But he argues that recruiting from a wider pool and bringing in talent from abroad raises everyone\u2019s standards - an approach that is now widely accepted in the scientific world.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you get people from Messina or Madrid moving to a cold place like Sheffield, they\u2019re serious about science,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s better for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Sir Martin Rees, emeritus professor of physics at the University of Cambridge, and the Astronomer Royal, said: \u201cThe UK scientific scene is now much stronger than it was [in the 1980s] - thanks in part of the strengthening of science on mainland Europe. But there is a serious risk, aggravated by the tone of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas\">Amber Rudd\u2019s deplorable speech on Tuesday</a>, that there will be a renewed surge of defections, weakening UK science and causing us to fail to recoup our investments over the last 20 years.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesman said: \u201cThis government has been clear that we will make a success of Brexit, including for our world class universities.<br><br>\u201cThe UK has a long established system that supports, and therefore attracts, the brightest minds, at all stages of their careers. We fund excellent research wherever it is found, and ensure there is the freedom to tackle important scientific questions. <br><br>\u201cLeaving the EU means we will be able to take our own decisions about how we deliver the policy objectives previously targeted by EU funding. Over the coming months we will consult closely with stakeholders to review all EU funding schemes, thereby ensuring that all funding commitments serve the UK\u2018s national interest.\u201d<br></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>The UK\u2019s productivity rate has returned to its pre-crisis level for the first time, but the country still lags well behind other major economies after years of sluggish growth.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/bulletins/labourproductivity/aprtojune2016\">output per hour increased</a> by 0.6% in the second quarter of this year and had at last recovered the ground lost after the 2008 downturn.<br></p> <p>However, underscoring the challenge faced by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who has vowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/philip-hammond-to-set-out-his-stall-for-balanced-budget-at-tory-conference\">improve Britain\u2019s lacklustre productivity</a>, ONS figures for 2015 showed that the gap between Britain the rest of the G7 group of leading economies <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/bulletins/internationalcomparisonsofproductivityfirstestimates/2015\">remained stubbornly wide</a>. At 18 percentage points in GDP per hour worked terms, the divide was unchanged on the 2014 level and economists warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/19/uk-business-confidence-at-four-year-low\">pressures on UK businesses</a> from the Brexit process could see the gap widen again over coming years.</p> <p>UK productivity was 27, 30 and 35 percentage points lower than in France, the US and Germany respectively.</p> <p>Experts have repeatedly highlighted Britain\u2019s poor productivity performance as a key factor in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/15/uk-living-standards-return-to-pre-financial-crash-levels\">squeeze on living standards</a> in the years after the financial crisis. In his speech to the Conservative party conference this week, Hammond said: \u201cIf we raised our productivity by just 1% every year, within a decade we would add \u00a3250bn to the size of our economy \u2013 \u00a39,000 for every household in Britain.\u201d</p> <p>The failure to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/25/growth-uk-productivity-crisis\">get UK productivity growing</a> again since the downturn is known as the \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d, with economists offering varying explanations, including an over-reliance on low-paid work, a lack of investment and the idea that productivity cannot rise at a high rate for ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/uk_productivity_chart/giv-14061BUVEu6K0GSp/\" data-alt=\"productivity\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/uk_productivity_chart/giv-14061BUVEu6K0GSp/\">productivity</a> </figure>  <p>The ONS noted that if pre-crisis trends had been sustained, output per hour in the UK would be 17.4% higher than it was in the second quarter. \u201cSince 2008, productivity as measured by output per hour has remained broadly flat, following a long upwards trend in prior decades,\u201d statisticians said.</p> <p>Britain was not alone in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/uk-productivity-gap-widens-to-worst-level-since-records-began\">taking a hit to productivity</a> from the financial crisis. Statisticians said output per hour was lower in all G7 countries in 2015 than it would have been had pre-downturn trends continued since 2007. </p> <p>The UK figures for the second quarter of this year, when the economy grew a relatively strong 0.7%, showed that output per worker was 0.2% higher and output per job was unchanged compared with the previous quarter.</p> <p>But average hours worked fell compared with the previous quarter, resulting in higher growth in output per hour of 0.6%, the fastest pace for a year.</p> <p>Output per hour in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/services-sector-growth-brexit-vote-uk\">services sector</a> rose by 0.6% on the previous quarter and 1.1% on the year before. Output per hour in manufacturing rose by 2.2% on the previous quarter and was 1% higher than a year earlier.<br></p> <p>John Philpott, the director of The Jobs Economist consultancy, said news of an increase in overall productivity growth was encouraging, but warned that the process of leaving the EU fuelled uncertainty about the UK\u2019s ability to climb the international productivity rankings.</p> <p>\u201cWhile likely curbs on unskilled migration may aid productivity by removing the drip feed of cheap EU labour to less efficient businesses, productivity could suffer if anti-migrant sentiment prevents the UK from attracting talent,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cFar more important, however, will be the impact of Brexit on business investment, which is almost certain to be adversely affected by short-run uncertainty, with longer run recovery critically dependent on the precise Brexit settlement the UK eventually reaches with the EU. Either way, there is little to suggest that the UK economy will any time soon begin to reverse its post-recession slide down the international productivity league table.\u201d</p> <p>Ian Brinkley of human resources trade group CIPD echoed this warning and said the onus was on Hammond to find ways to keep productivity growing.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>With the long-term challenges posed by Brexit and wider adverse global trends, it is imperative that we do not let this recovery slip away,\u201d he said. \u201cSecuring a sustained recovery can only come from increased investment in people and new technologies. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/philip-hammond-announces-autumn-budget-statement-for-23-november\">forthcoming autumn statement</a> needs to show how the government intends to support future productivity growth through investment in infrastructure, skills, and the science base.\u201d</p> <p>Others have urged the chancellor not to focus solely on high-value sectors, but look at productivity in the parts of the economy that employ low-paid workers. </p> <p>By broadening the industrial strategy to include low-paying sectors, the government could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/03/philip-hammond-urged-to-downgrade-autumn-statement\">make greater economic gains</a>, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said, and lift hundreds of thousands of people out of working poverty. </p> <p>The charity published an analysis this week showing that almost 1 million workers are trapped in working poverty in the retail, residential care, and hotels and catering sectors, in which productivity lags behind the economy as a whole. </p>",

But May insisted she would still seek \u201cto give British companies the maximum freedom to trade and operate in the single market\u201d.</p> <p>The report\u2019s stark warnings are likely to redouble demands from Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/may-on-collision-course-with-backbenchers-seeking-soft-brexit\">keeping single market membership</a> should be the UK\u2019s main priority after the June referendum\u2019s narrow vote to leave. </p> <p>The FAI\u2019s study for Holyrood\u2019s Europe committee forecasts that even in a best-case scenario, where the UK adopts Norwegian-style membership of the single market but remains outside the EU, the Scottish economy would lose up to \u00a35bn in value over 10 years.</p> <p>The institute, part of the University of Strathclyde, said its modelling suggested that up to 30,000 people in Scotland could lose their jobs while wages for those still in work would fall by about 3-4% or \u00a3800 to \u00a31,200 a year. </p> <p>Professor Graeme Roy, the thinktank\u2019s director, said its forecasts suggested the UK\u2019s economy would be even harder hit by Brexit because a far higher volume of its exports went into the EU, suggesting higher job losses and deeper cuts to GDP. </p> <p>Scotland\u2019s economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/04/scottish-economy-grows-far-more-slowly-than-uk-as-a-whole\">was weaker and more sluggish </a>than the UK\u2019s as a whole before the referendum, with public spending running a substantial \u00a315bn annual deficit, increasing its vulnerability. </p> <p>As Scotland\u2019s largest market remains the rest of the UK, with EU trade worth \u00a311.5bn versus \u00a348.5bn from the rest of the UK, a recession south of the border would add to the pressure on Scottish businesses. And unlike the 2008 banking crash, this impact would be long-term.</p> <p>Roy added that there were complex forces at play. Some industries with greater reliance on EU trade, such as transport and services, would be hit hardest. Under a hard Brexit scenario, 25,000 jobs would be lost from wholesale and retail, transport and warehousing sectors alone. Ministers could now start looking at strategies for supporting the most vulnerable sectors.</p> <p>But others with a wider global market may not be so hard hit. The Scotch whisky industry, which generates up to \u00a35bn a year in exports but supports relatively few jobs, could benefit from a lower pound and see sales grow in non-EU markets. </p> <p>Joan McAlpine MSP, the convener of the culture, tourism, Europe and external relations committee which commissioned the report, said it\u201cpaints a grim picture\u201d.If the UK government leads us into a hard Brexit the evidence presented in this report indicates that there could be disastrous consequences for jobs, exports and production,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour\u2019s economy spokeswoman, said: \u201cThis report shows the cost of the Tories\u2019 reckless Brexit gamble and how vital it is that Scotland, and indeed the whole UK, retains access to the single market. When Theresa May hinted at a hard Brexit earlier this week, sterling crashed to a 31-year low. Even the most blinkered of Brexiteers cannot ignore the huge risk this poses to our economy.\u201d</p> <p>A UK government spokeswoman said May and David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, had already made clear they were seeking a bespoke deal with the EU, to get the best outcome possible. \u201cAs the report itself recognises, we have not begun negotiating our exit from the EU, so it seems very premature to draw conclusions from some highly speculative models,\u201d she said. </p>",

  "<p>For Phil Thompson it is simply \u201cthat moment\u201d, and a little over 15 years on he can recollect it with crystal clarity. The build-up, the pressure, the atmosphere, the seconds ticking away, the set-up, the strike, the joy that followed and how ultimately he was delighted to have been proven wrong.</p> <p>It was towards the end of the 1999-00 season that G\u00e9rard Houllier, Liverpool\u2019s then manager, asked his assistant what he thought about signing Gary McAllister, a highly-skilled, much-respected midfielder but who by that stage was 35-years-old and had spent the past four campaigns as part of a Coventry City side that was locked in the bottom half of the table. \u201cI told Gerard that it may send the wrong message to the fans,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cWe were meant to be building a team around our talented set of youngsters so it didn\u2019t feel right to bring in someone of Gary\u2019s age. He was a top-quality player, of good footballing stock, but he was at the end of his career. I didn\u2019t see the logic in bringing him in.\u201d</p> <p>Houllier took on board what his assistant, and friend, said but went ahead and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/may/26/newsstory.sport2\">acquired McAllister in late May 2000 on a free transfer</a>. Less than 12 months later, the Frenchman\u2019s decision had been well and truly vindicated. \u201cIt proved to be a masterstroke,\u201d Thompson admits. \u201cGary cost nothing and within a season had became a Liverpool legend. It\u2019s hard to think of another player making such an impact in such a short space of time.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/30/golden-goal-ritchie-humphreys-sheffield-wednesday-leicester\">Golden Goal: Ritchie Humphreys for Sheffield Wednesday v Leicester (1996)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There have been others, at Anfield and elsewhere, who blew away expectations in a blink of an eye but few whose contribution was so tangible, in the short and long term. McAllister not only played a pivotal role in Liverpool\u2019s stunning success in the 2000-01 season \u2013 the club won three trophies and qualified for the Champions League for a first time \u2013 but also helped inspire that \u201ctalented set of youngsters\u201d on to greater things, most significantly a 20-year-old, cropped-haired midfielder called Steven Gerrard.</p> <p>Such was the span of McAllister\u2019s impact at Liverpool that it should be difficult to pick out a standout memory from his two years at the club, but Thompson can. For the 62-year-old boyhood Red it can only be what the Scot did to Everton in April 2001, that stunning stoppage-time winner in a stormy derby that not only silenced the majority of those watching on at Goodison Park but injected a surge of belief into a team that would go on to clean up.</p> <p>To fully appreciate what McAllister did against Everton, and went onto do during the final weeks of the 2000-01 season, it is worth remembering how testing the player\u2019s arrival at Anfield had been. Thompson wasn\u2019t the only one who had doubts over a club of Liverpool\u2019s standing and ambition acquiring someone who was in their mid-thirties, albeit a crucial member of the Leeds United team that had won the title eight years earlier and at Coventry had showed he still retained the ability to dictate the tempo of top-flight matches from central midfield. McAllister was a pass master but many felt he was past his best.</p> <p>Fortunately for McAllister, Houllier did not share that opinion and so targeted the softly-spoken son of Motherwell towards the end of what was his first full season in sole charge of Liverpool, one that would end with the club finishing fourth.</p> <p>Back then, that was not good enough for Champions League qualification \u2013 you had to finish at least third and Liverpool missed out to Leeds by two points. Ahead of the new campaign, a return to Europe\u2019s elite competition for the first time since 1985 was a must and Houllier, going against the scepticism and concerns of others, including his second-in-command, felt Coventry\u2019s No10 could help.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76dbfeb4327612f42b23109d07105cea899b4ae0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76dbfeb4327612f42b23109d07105cea899b4ae0/0_79_2834_1700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary McAllister poses with Liverpool\u2019s other summer signings, as well as Phil Thompson, bottom left, and Gerard Houllier ahead of the 2000-01 season\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">McAllister poses with Liverpool\u2019s other summer signings, as well as Phil Thompson, bottom left, and Gerard Houllier ahead of the 2000-01 season</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Regan/Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cGerard wanted to shake off the Spice Boys image at Liverpool,\u201d McAllister told the journalist Graham Hunter during a recent interview. \u201cI never really brought into that image \u2013 they were a good team, a team that should\u2019ve done better \u2013 but the Spice Boys thing hung around them and Gerard wanted a senior player who could bring something a wee bit different.</p> <p>\u201cHe told me: \u2018You won\u2019t be playing every game \u2013 we want to bring you in to lead by example\u2019.

The Scot took his lead from seeing how his compatriot Gordon Strachan had prepared himself prior to joining Leeds at a similar age in 1989 and the impact was as he intended: \u201cI got immediate respect,\u201d McAllister recalls of his early training sessions at Liverpool\u2019s Melwood base.</p> <p>On the pitch, life began less than smoothly for the oldest of Liverpool\u2019s six summer signings. Having come on as a 68th-minute substitute in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/Observer_Match_Report/0,,-28315,00.html\">opening day victory over Bradford City</a>, McAllister was picked from the start for the visit to Arsenal three days later. He only last 39 minutes of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/aug/21/newsstory.sport8\">2-0 defeat</a>, however, after being shown a straight red card by referee Graham Poll for a two-footed tackle on Patrick Vieira, who himself was later dismissed, as was Dietmar Hamann.</p> <p>McAllister didn\u2019t play again for Liverpool until the 4-0 victory at Derby County in mid-October but from there his influence on the team grew, so much so that Houllier trusted him to start in a number of high-profile games, including both legs of the Uefa Cup last-16 tie with Roma.</p> <p>In part, McAllister got his chances to impress due to the injuries Gerrard was collecting during a period of early-career growing pains for the tyro who would go on to become king, but that did not lead to resentment on his part. Quite the opposite, in fact, with Gerrard testifying to the importance of having McAllister in close proximity during his formative years.</p> <p>\u201cOn away trips I timed my run to the bus so I could sit next to McAllister, absorbing advice,\u201d Gerrard wrote in his 2006 autobiography. \u201cEvery journey was like a lesson, with me an awestruck pupil. Gary Mac definitely helped me, particularly with my passing. He was such a clever man in possession himself. Just watching Gary in training improved me. He was a master-class on legs.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7393ec34b0872c57877917a921de2e5cae63a071\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7393ec34b0872c57877917a921de2e5cae63a071/0_84_2793_1676/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steven Gerrard joins Gary McAllister in celebration. \u201cHe was a master-class on legs,\u201d said the future Liverpool captain of the Scott\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steven Gerrard joins McAllister in celebration. \u201cHe was a master-class on legs,\u201d said the future Liverpool captain of the Scot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony O'Brien/Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The like of Danny Murphy, Jamie Carragher and Michael Owen, who were 23, 22 and 20 respectively when McAllister joined them at Liverpool, have also spoken of the impact the Scot had on them. \u201cThere couldn\u2019t have been a finer role model for any young player,\u201d Carragher wrote in his own autobiography. \u201cSome older heads when they offer advice can sound preachy and make you want to switch off. Gary Mac wasn\u2019t like that. When he had something to tell you, it always made sense. I\u2019m sure the two years many of us spent working with him had a huge influence on our careers.\u201d</p> <p>Influencing games and influencing players around him, McAllister had firmly settled at Liverpool as the \u2018business end\u2019 of the 2000-01 season approached, but one thing he was struggling to do in a red shirt was score goals. By the spring there has only been one \u2013 the opener in a 4-1 victory over Coventry in November 2000, and the midfielder\u2019s record suggested he should be chipping in with more. Indeed, he got 13 during the 1999-00 campaign, finishing as Coventry\u2019s top-scorer, just ahead of Robbie Keane.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/19/golden-goal-david-beckham-manchester-united-wimbledon-1996-halfway-line\">Golden Goal: David Beckham for Manchester United against Wimbledon (1996)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A fair few of those 13 goals came from set pieces and in fairness to McAllister, he did not have similar responsibility for free-kicks and penalties at Liverpool. What he needed as the season moved towards its conclusion was a chance to show what he could do with a dead ball ...</p> <p>Liverpool travelled to Goodison Park on 16 April 2001 \u2013 Easter Monday \u2013 in stuttering form. A 1-1 draw with Derby the previous month saw them slip out of the top three and so the last thing they could afford was to drop points in their back-to-back games against Ipswich Town and Leeds, two of the teams they were competing with for a top-three finish. Liverpool drew with Ipswich and then, on Good Friday, lost to Leeds at Anfield. It was a blow and one that made the trip across Stanley Park even more significant. Sat in fifth with seven games remaining, Houllier\u2019s men simply had to win.</p> <p>Remarkably, Liverpool had not done that at Everton since 1990. The Blues, to put it mildly, were not the force they once were but they got themselves up for the derby. \u201cThe pressure was really on us going into the game,\u201d Thompson remembers. \u201cLeeds had beaten us a few days earlier and now we were facing a team who love nothing more than beating Liverpool. We knew it was going to be a battle\u201d.</p> <p>And that it was. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/apr/17/match.sport7\">Reporting for the Guardian</a>, Paul Walker described the 164th meeting of Merseyside\u2019s big two as \u201cchaotic\u201d and \u201cspiteful\u201d and for Liverpool, the hostilities began prior to kick-off when a minority of Everton fans failed to respect a minute\u2019s silence for the 96 victims of the Hillsborough disaster. During the game itself, there were 12 bookings, with two of those shown to Igor Biscan, Liverpool\u2019s right-winger on the day. The visitors also had to endure a missed penalty by Robbie Fowler and, most galling of all, two lost leads, with David Unsworth getting Everton back on level terms for a second time with just seven minutes remaining.</p> <p>Heading into the third minute of stoppage time, a 2-2 draw looked like being Liverpool\u2019s lot. That was unless someone could produce a late moment of magic.</p> <p>Cue \u201cthat moment.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YugvLIbUmQM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YugvLIbUmQM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Gary McAllister strikes at the death at Goodison Park.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>McAllister had not been having the best of games \u2013 the frantic nature of proceedings making a player of such refined skills a somewhat peripheral figure \u2013 and instead it was Hamann, the Scot\u2019s partner in central midfielder, who was the more influential of the two, with the German playing key passes in the build-up to Liverpool\u2019s first two goals, scored by Emile Heskey and Markus Babbel. But after Gregory Vignal was fouled by Niclas Alexandersson as he led a counter-attack into Everton\u2019s half, McAllister had no hesitation stepping up to take the free-kick.</p> <p>Liverpool\u2019s No21 was 44 yards away from goal but, as Evertonians are quick to point out, he did not stay that far out for long. \u201cThank God referees didn\u2019t have their sprays back then because Gary moved that free-kick forward by at least five yards!\u201d Thompson remembers with a hearty laugh.</p> <p>Positioned left of centre inside Everton\u2019s half, McAllister\u2019s intention appeared clear \u2013 to play a right-footed cross towards the back post. That certainly seemed to be how Liverpool\u2019s posse of four players inside the area read the situation, in particular Sami Hyypia, who having been by the penalty spot, jogged in that direction. McAllister raised his left arm and pointed towards where the centre-back was moving. His body was also facing that way. Everything seemed set for a deep, inswinging delivery.</p> <p>\u201cGary showed his experience and intelligence, and just how crafty he could be, because he saw the goalkeeper also move towards the back post and decided to give him the eyes,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cNormally you give the keeper the eyes from 10 yards, Gary did it from closer to 40.\u201d</p> <p>In front of McAllister was a two-man wall consisting of Alexandersson and Kevin Campbell. Had they stood firm the result, and history, may have been different. But they didn\u2019t. As McAllister ran towards the ball, Campbell edged towards his left, creating a gap which the midfilder\u2019s subsequent shot travelled through.</p> <p>Alongside a huge element of surprise, it had whip and bounce \u2013 one to be precise, just before the goaline and strong enough to take the ball past Everton\u2019s keeper Paul Gerrard as he made a despairing and ultimately futile dive back towards the near post.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jul/22/golden-goal-roberto-baggio-for-juventus-against-internazionale-1992\">Golden Goal: Roberto Baggio for Juventus against Internazionale (1992) | Rob Smyth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhat a goal by Gary McAllister!\u201d exclaimed Sky Sports commentator Alan Parry as the player ran in celebration towards the Liverpool bench. There stood Houllier, whose wide-eyed, wide-mouth expression was akin to that of a toddler who had just spotted his mummy at the nursery gates.</p> <p>\u201cIt was mayhem when the ball hit the back of the net,\u201d recollects Thompson. \u201cThe Liverpool fans over by the far side celebrated like we\u2019d won the FA Cup while all the staff went completely mad. I was all over the place and I\u2019ll never forget seeing Sammy Lee [Liverpool\u2019s assistant coach] jumping on the players as they charged over to us.\u201d</p> <p>Liverpool supporter and football writer Steven Scragg was at Goodison Park that evening and, like Thompson, will never forget the moment McAllister struck. \u201cThe Upper Bullens is one of the most aesthetically pleasing places for going nuts to an injury-time winning goal on derby day and it\u2019s fair to say the away section embraced bedlam when that ball hit the back of the Everton net,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a release of utter joy, an exorcising of anger and frustration. There was a sense of Everton getting away with something, but then McAllister obliterated it all with that swing of his right boot.\u201d</p> <p>The victory was dramatic but it did not lift Liverpool from fifth. Crucially, however, they were now only three points behind Leeds in fourth and six behind Ipswich in third with a game in hand on the former and two in hand on the latter. Given the nature of their triumph over Everton, there was also a sense of destiny swirling across Anfield.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc031268b6e65ed12756d84287cf0e3509beb871\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc031268b6e65ed12756d84287cf0e3509beb871/0_263_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Future Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina can only look on as McAllister seals Liverpool\u2019s victory over Barcelona in their Uefa Cup semi-final, second leg tie at Anfield\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Future Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina can only look on as McAllister seals Liverpool\u2019s victory over Barcelona in their Uefa Cup semi-final, second leg tie at Anfield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Odd Andersen/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I call Gary\u2019s goal \u2018that moment\u2019,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cIt not only won us the derby but gave us real belief that we could get into the Champions League and reestablish the club among the biggest and best in Europe. It was huge.\u201d</p> <p>And that is what Liverpool did \u2013 winning five and drawing one of their remaining six league games to pip Leeds to third. They also beat <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwE3h0iMjY8\">Arsenal in the FA Cup final</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/may/17/uefa.sport2\">Alaves in the Uefa Cup final</a> on the back of having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/feb/26/match.sport13\">triumphed over Birmingham City in February\u2019s League Cup final</a>. It was a remarkable achievement by one of English football\u2019s most underrated squads, one that combined ruggedness and resilience with craft and a killer edge.</p> <p>And central to their surge to glory, in position and contribution, was McAllister. Following his goal at Goodison Park, the Scot scored in each of his next four appearances, with each strike not only important but also reiterating the player\u2019s deadly accuracy from dead balls \u2013 a penalty that secured victory against Barcelona in the Uefa Cup semi-final, second leg at Anfield, the penalty which reestablished Liverpool\u2019s lead in their 3-1 league win against Tottenham Hotspur, the free-kick that sealed all three points against Coventry at Highfield Road, and another successful free-kick away to Bradford.</p> <p>And then there was the 41st-minute penalty and the free-kick in extra time that led to Delfi Geli\u2019s decisive own goal in the 5-4 win against Alaves. Amid the celebrations at Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Westfalenstadion, McAllister was presented with the man-of-the-match trophy by Johan Cruyff. Not surprisingly, the Scot describes that night as the best of his career.</p> <p>McAllister final season at Liverpool was a more muted affair \u2013 he made 38 appearances but scored just twice and not at all after 9 October 2001. But as far as the fans were concerned he had done enough, see by the fact he was given a standing ovation after coming on as an 82nd minute in his final appearance in a red shirt - the end-of-season <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/may/12/match.sport8\">5-0 victory over Ipswich at Anfield</a>.</p> <p>To this day, his name is still sung by the Liverpool faithful via the \u2018Gary Macca\u2019 song, which to the tune of Alouette celebrates \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_P_AIDtS2Y\">yer derby goal</a>\u201d. And from those who worked with McAllister have come the most resounding of tributes. Houllier hails him as his \u201cmost inspirational signing\u201d, while Thompson recalls the Scot being \u201cperfection in everything he did.\u201d</p> <p>And from Carragher comes perhaps the most profound and poignant piece of praise: \u201cIf ever a player was born to play for Liverpool it was him. He fitted the bill as someone the fans could relate to, classy and cultured on the off the pitch and reminding the club of the working-class Scottish heritage that has been so influential in our history.</p> <p>\u201cNo player has been at a club for such a short period but made such a lasting impression. It\u2019s a tragedy for Liverpool they didn\u2019t sign him 10 years earlier. The club would have won a lot more trophies during that time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1df0afb094a53eec1ef571b174f4c432551bce79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1df0afb094a53eec1ef571b174f4c432551bce79/0_64_1568_941/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary McAllister: a goalscoring hero for Liverpool in green as well as red\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary McAllister: a goalscoring hero for Liverpool in green as well as red.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary M.

  "<p>When it comes to the diverse range of people championing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/poetry\" title=\"\">poetry</a> in the UK, we seemingly have a lot to celebrate this National Poetry Day.

Writing and mentoring schemes such as <a href=\"http://slam.poetrysociety.org.uk/\" title=\"\">SLAMbassadors UK</a>, <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/education/young-people/young-poets\" title=\"\">Barbican Young Poets</a> and the<a href=\"http://www.roundhouse.org.uk/whats-on/2014/roundhouse-poetry-collective/\" title=\"\"> Roundhouse Poetry Collective</a> (as well as the Roundhouse\u2019s annual poetry slam) have become almost a rite of passage for young poets, a way for them to take their first guided steps into the poetry scene. The accessibility of the internet and the way it has revolutionised not just how poetry is shared but also what \u201ccounts\u201d as poetry shouldn\u2019t be underestimated either, with YouTube now host to thousands upon thousands of spoken-word videos from across the globe.</p> <p>Unlike a lot of other creative artforms, poetry has managed to diversify itself from the inside \u2013 up to a point. While it might be obvious that the future of poetry is diverse, many people fail to recognise that the present is too. Over the past year, Private Eye magazine has published cutting remarks about various women of colour in poetry \u2013 attributing half-Chinese Sarah Howe\u2019s win of the acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/11/ts-eliot-prize-poet-sarah-howe-wins-with-amazing-debut\" title=\"\">TS Eliot prize</a> to her good looks, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/sep/30/forward-prize-backward-reading-who-grumbles-if-white-writers-win-awards\" title=\"\">implying a kind of nepotism</a> because British-Caribbean poet Malika Booker was head of the panel that chose two Caribbean women as Forward prize recipients.

It's the cure for bigotry | Anjali Enjeti</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The poetry world is also not immune to the racism and sexism that is in the literary scene as a whole. Despite women and people of colour dominating the open mics and poetry slams that keep the scene alive, it is noticeable that you see more men and white people booked for paying gigs and festivals, and more still actually being published \u2013 and I don\u2019t accept that white men are simply better writers. Saying that, they are rarely working class, with classism also a huge but often forgotten problem in poetry. The literary establishment needs to not just encourage and promote more writing from working-class writers, young and old, but also move past assumptions that working-class young boys, for example, won\u2019t want to write poems. The seemingly endless debates about what counts as \u201cproper\u201d poetry and what is \u201cmerely spoken word\u201d are fuelled by a need to define and control the artform, and do little more than alienate the people who enjoy poems under, or identify with, this label.</p> <p>In the closing lines of <a href=\"http://www.poetryarchive.org/poem/my-country\" title=\"\">Jackie Kay\u2019s In My Country</a>, the poet is defiant about where she comes from: \u201c\u2018Here. These parts.\u2019\u201d Writers from all backgrounds deserve the right to feel as strongly about their place in British poetry, regardless of where we may appear to come from. Diversity is not a dirty word, and ensuring that female, working-class and non-white poets are both writing and performing can only serve to make an already wealthy scene even richer.</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May has signalled that she will use the Brexit vote as a mandate to break decisively with David Cameron\u2019s brand of Conservatism, pledging to intervene on behalf of working class voters and crack down on immigration.</p> <p>In a populist speech to her party\u2019s conference in Birmingham, the prime minister painted June\u2019s referendum result as a \u201cquiet revolution\u201d that should force politicians to tackle public concerns, repeatedly telling delegates that \u201cchange must come\u201d.</p> <p>May said she saw the referendum result as a political turning point, which legitimised a tougher line on immigration and more state intervention in the public\u2019s lives.

Sturgeon said May\u2019s speech and the policies she laid out were \u201cthe most disgraceful display of reactionary rightwing politics in living memory\u201d.</p> <p>Anticipating such criticism, May said in her speech that some people did not like to admit that British workers could \u201cfind themselves out of work or on lower wages because of low-skilled immigration\u201d.</p> <p>Business leaders also reacted angrily to a proposal the home secretary, Amber Rudd, made on Tuesday to force firms to reveal what proportion of their workforce are immigrants in a bid to \u201cname and shame\u201d businesses that fail to take on British staff.</p> <p>Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the CBI, said: \u201cWe have been a magnet for talent for many years.

  "<p>On a scorching afternoon, a small group of tourists are queuing on a pretty, wooded hillside to get their photo taken.

In the aftermath of the second world war, Vaals was a hotbed for smugglers. Packets of coffee and cigarettes were lobbed over border fences into a ruined Germany, as locals sought to cash in on shortages. By the 1970s the Dutch were driving across the border, car boots laden with undeclared West German hi-fis and cameras. \u201cVaals has always been a very plural place,\u201d Van Loo says, describing how 18th-century Catholics and Protestants of all denominations could worship in the town when it was forbidden elsewhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2016-08-25T12:41:15.html\" data-alt=\"Germany, Netherlands and Belgium meeting map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2016-08-25T12:41:15.html\">Germany, Netherlands and Belgium meeting map</a> </figure>  <p>Yet this dream of freedom to live and work anywhere in the European Union has been called into question like never before since the Brexit vote.

David Cameron thought he could persuade the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to grant him limits on EU migrants. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-29874392\"> He was wrong</a>: the former prime minister did get an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/07/david-camerons-emergency-brake-wins-fans-across-the-continent\">emergency brake</a> to ban EU migrants from getting immediate access to benefits, but this was dismissed as useless by Conservative backbenchers set on leaving the EU.<br></p> <p>Since Cameron\u2019s renegotiation, it has been clear the EU would not budge on free movement of people. Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, said last month that the EU\u2019s four freedoms \u2013 people, services, goods and capital \u2013 were inseparable, echoing a consensus among EU leaders that shows no sign of cracking. \u201cI refuse to imagine a Europe where lorries and hedge funds are free to cross borders but citizens are not,\u201d Schulz said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3c57db453e7bf55ee6ce0d906a963a224b2357d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3c57db453e7bf55ee6ce0d906a963a224b2357d/0_0_5150_3427/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers relax before departure at the cafe bar at Fryderyk Chopin Airport Warsaw.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers relax before departure at the cafe bar at Fryderyk Chopin Airport Warsaw.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Merkel on Wednesday made her clearest statement yet \u2013 saying full access to the single market could only come in exchange for signing up to the four freedoms. \u201cAnything else would amount to a systemic challenge for the entire European Union,\u201d she told the BGA trade association.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Free movement runs through many fundamental questions for the EU, says Andr\u00e9 Sapir, a professor at the Bruegel thinktank and influential former adviser to the European commission: the relationship between western and eastern Europe, how the EU manages an unprecedented influx of refugees, as well as attitudes to Turkey and its long-stalled hopes of joining the EU.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not simply making a deal with the UK. The number of dimensions here is endless,\u201d Sapir said. \u201cIf you start putting brakes on this now, in a sense, you are going back on the original EU project. It is one thing the UK leaving, it is another one to start tinkering with the EU as we know it.\u201d</p> <p>Free movement was part of the European idea from the start, when six countries embarked on integration nearly 60 years ago at the Conservatori palace in Rome. The Treaty of Rome and its four freedoms created the fledgling European Economic Community that became today\u2019s EU.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc6ae2c33849d810dcd7f2263a085947df5fd0ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc6ae2c33849d810dcd7f2263a085947df5fd0ec/0_235_2482_1489/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The signing of the Treaty of Rome in 25 March 1957.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The signing of the Treaty of Rome in 25 March 1957.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But free movement was not carved on stone tablets and initially was restricted to workers. Damian Chalmers, professor of EU law at the London School of Economics, describes the original provision as an afterthought tacked on to please the Italian government. Of the three biggest founding members, France had got farm subsidies and Germany had abolished tariffs for its industrial goods. The Italian government, grappling with the poor southern part of the country, wanted a payoff, says Chalmers, describing Italian workers who moved north as the \u201ccentral-eastern Europeans of the 1950s\u201d.</p> <p>Free movement of workers did not become free movement of citizens until 1993, following another treaty, signed at Maastricht, a city deep in EU heartland that is a short distance from Vaals.<br></p> <p>After Maastricht, Europeans could not only work abroad but study or retire in other EU countries. Amid the surge in optimism following the fall of the Berlin wall, Brussels hoped that citizenship would give the European project the mass appeal it had always lacked.</p> <p>\u201cThe people you talk to in Brussels see [free movement] as central to the dream of a people\u2019s Europe, that is not just about multinationals,\u201d said Chalmers.</p> <p>But still, not many people felt starry-eyed about the EU, or much inclined to live abroad. Few EU nationals chose to move to another country, a fact that caused handwringing in the Brussels beltway around the turn of the century. Policymakers, about to embark on a single currency, fretted that Europe could never match the United States for labour mobility if a person from Manchester wouldn\u2019t move to Munich.</p> <p>That all changed when10 central and eastern European countries joined the EU in two waves in 2004 and 2007 (as well as the Mediterranean islands of Malta and Cyprus). By 2014, around 5% of the EU\u2019s working-age population was born in another member state, compared with just 1% in 2000. In the UK, the figure was 7% of the working-age population. <br></p> <p>Post the Brexit vote, Britain now wants to stop Europeans arriving. May told her Polish counterpart that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/28/theresa-may-on-brexit-tour-of-eastern-europe\">Brexit vote was \u201ca very clear message\u201d</a> on demands to reduce EU migration \u2013 a message that has gone down badly in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The four central European countries, known as the Visegr\u00e1d 4, have vowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/17/eastern-bloc-countries-will-uphold-citizens-rights-to-live-in-uk\">block any future deal with the UK </a>that limits the free movement of their citizens. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f50ade4053de5e2db4fad47e050ebef58e0c578c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f50ade4053de5e2db4fad47e050ebef58e0c578c/0_1_5785_3473/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May addresses the Conservative party conference\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May tells the Conservative party Britain is \u2018not leaving the European Union only to give up control of immigration again\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But senior EU diplomats think the Visegr\u00e1d 4 will prioritise their compatriots already in the UK rather than future movers. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">\u201c</strong>Poland and Hungary will fight for their citizens already there, not for the future, because they could use the workforce back home,\u201d one senior European diplomat told the Guardian. </p> <p>The diplomat pointed out that central Europe was dependent on EU money to keep public works programmes going. \u201cI think they will be ready to make a concession,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are saying citizens\u2019 rights are important but behind the scenes <em tabindex=\"-1\">c\u2019est le fric </em>[it\u2019s the cash].\u201d</p> <p>The Brexit negotiations will turn on these kind of trade-offs, a complex haggle over soaring principle and sharp-elbowed self-interest involving 28 governments and three EU institutions.</p> <p>But this does not mean the British government will get the \u201cmaximum freedom\u201d to trade that May promised Conservative party activists.</p> <p>Sapir, the economist, is one of five high-powered policymakers who argued the EU should allow the UK generous access to the single market, without the fourth freedom. Unlimited free movement of people is not essential for economic integration, they <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bruegel.org/2016/08/europe-after-brexit-a-proposal-for-a-continental-partnership/\">wrote in a Bruegel paper</a>, rather it is the element that makes the single market a political project. Yet in Brussels, Paris and Berlin, the blueprint was almost regarded as heresy. It might make economic sense, but it is \u201cpolitically naive\u201d, one senior EU diplomat said.</p> <p>And once the herculean task of Brexit is done, one curiosity for historians will be how far British voters\u2019 discontent chimed with the anxieties of their neighbours. Brussels has recently acceded to France\u2019s demand for reform of EU labour laws to make it harder for companies to hire cheap workers from eastern Europe and undercut locally agreed minimum wages.</p> <p>French anxieties about cheap workers or German worries about integrating refugees do not exactly reflect the British rejection of migration, but there are common threads. \u201cIn the name of austerity we have cut holes in our safety net to such a degree that many feel that the open economy is to their detriment in the short term and offers no prospects in the long term,\u201d one senior EU official said.</p> <p>Even in the self-styled heart of the EU region, people feel anxious and detached from the EU. Van Loo, a self-described \u201cEurope-minded mayor\u201d, says the EU needs to change, become less bureaucratic and allow greater regional variation. Many Dutch people share the British view that \u201ceverything that is going wrong is because of membership of the European Union\u201d, he says, a stance that troubles him.<br></p> <p>Despite these doubts, he does not think these anti-EU forces ever will sweep away the free flow of people in his three-country neighbourhood. \u201cWe will always find a way to cross the borders.\u201d</p>",

Right now, the global bottled water industry is in one of those strange and energetic boom phases where every week, it seems, a new product finds its way on to the shelves. Not just another bland still or sparkling, but some entirely new definition of the element. It is a case of capitalism at its most hyperactive and brazenly inventive: take a freely available substance, dress it up in countless different costumes and then sell it as something new and capable of transforming body, mind, soul. Water is no longer simply water \u2013 it has become a commercial blank slate, a word on to which any possible ingredient or fantastical, life-enhancing promise can be attached.</p> <p>And it\u2019s working. Over the past two decades, bottled water has become the fastest-growing drinks market in the world. The global market was valued at $157bn in 2013, and is expected to reach $280bn by 2020. Last year, in the UK alone, consumption of water drinks grew by 8.2%, equating to a retail value of more than \u00a32.5bn. Sales of water are 100 times higher than in 1980.

According to James Salzman, the author of Drinking Water: A History, monks at holy wells produced special water flasks for pilgrims to take away as proof of their visit \u2013 a medieval example of the power of branding. For centuries, wealthy Europeans travelled to spa towns to sample the water in a bid to cure specific ailments. The spa visit was a signal of health, but also of status: somewhere to be seen, an association of liquid and individual that broadcasted social elevation \u2013 a distant precursor to Kim Kardashian clutching a bottle of Fiji, if you like. In 1740, the first commercial British bottled water was launched in Harrogate. By 1914 Harrogate Spring was, according to its website, the largest exporter of bottled water in the country, \u201cproudly keeping the troops hydrated from England to Bombay\u201d.</p> <p>In the early 20th century, however, a water revolution nearly killed the nascent business. After early attempts in Germany and Belgium to chlorinate municipal drinking water, a typhoid epidemic in Lincoln in 1905 prompted the public health crusader Alexander Cruickshank Houston to try out the first extended chlorination of a public water supply. His experiment worked, and soon, chlorination of municipal water had spread around the world. In 1908, Jersey City became the first US city to use full-scale water chlorination, and the practice quickly spread across the country.</p> <p>The bottled water industry almost collapsed as a result. In the past, buying clean water had been a necessity for the rich (the poor simply endured centuries of bad drinking water, and often died from the experience). Now it was freely available to all. Why would you continue to spend money on something that now came, miraculously, out of a tap in your kitchen?</p> <p>The answer arrived in 1977, in the form of what must be one of history\u2019s greatest pieces of television advertising narration. \u201cDeep below the plains of southern France,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qHv4yh4R9c\">rumbled Orson Welles</a> in a voice that sounded as if it were bubbling up from some unreachable subterranean cave, \u201cin a mysterious process begun millions of years ago, Nature herself adds life to the icy waters of a single spring: <em>Perrier</em>.\u201d As viewers watched the water descend into a glass, and admired the glistening green bottle, marketing history was made. The advert was part of a $5m campaign across America \u2013 the largest ever for a bottled water \u2013 and proved a major success. From 1975 to 1978, Perrier sales in the US increased from 2.5m bottles to more than 75m bottles.</p> <p>The Perrier triumph was part of \u201ca perfect confluence\u201d, Salzman told me, of a sudden craze for aerobics in the US, prompted, in part, by Jane Fonda releasing her first exercise video \u2013 Jane Fonda\u2019s Workout, the highest-selling video of all time \u2013 in 1982. There was a new drive not just to be healthy, but to be seen to be healthy. In 1985, Time magazine noted that \u201cwater snobbery has replaced wine snobbery as the latest noon-hour recreation. People order their <em>eau</em> by brand name, as they once did Scotch.\u201d</p> <p>Soon enough, rumours circulated of Madonna bathing in bottled water, and Jack Nicholson was photographed brandishing a bottle of Evian at the Oscars as if it were Cristal. There was also a key practical innovation: in 1977, plastic or PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles were introduced into the soft drink market. By 1990, they were being used for bottled water, making it as convenient and portable as a fizzy drink. The big soft drink brands, spotting the obvious commercial opportunity, soon launched their own waters: PepsiCo\u2019s Aquafina in 1994, Coca-Cola\u2019s Dasani in 1999, and Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Pure Life in 2002. Water was back.</p> <p>Water\u2019s glorious renaissance wasn\u2019t just about fashion or convenience. Bottled water can be marked up like no other substance on earth. The \u00a31 that a bottle of water often costs could pay for around 1,000 gallons of tap water. Some waters \u2013 Evian, Perrier, Highland Spring and Harrogate Spring \u2013 come from natural sources, so at least you feel you\u2019re paying for geography, for the fantasy of a shepherd sitting on a rock catching the icy flow in a glass jar specifically for your pleasure. But plenty of bottled waters are simply refashioned tap water.</p> <p>In February 2004, Coca-Cola attempted to launch Dasani in the UK. (\u201cDasani\u201d, by the way, means nothing.) Five weeks later, the company took all 500,000 bottles off the shelves after headlines such as the Daily Star\u2019s \u201cAre They Taking Us For Plonkers!\u201d Coca-Cola had followed its successful strategy in the US and purified tap water, added some mineral salts, and was selling it for 95p a bottle. The company hadn\u2019t, however, accounted for Britain\u2019s long memory for sitcom storylines \u2013 in this case, the episode of Only Fools and Horses when Del Boy and Rodney bottle tap water in their flat and sell it as Peckham Spring. Then there was the issue of a batch of minerals contaminating Dasani with a possibly carcinogenic bromate. In a little more than a month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/apr/18/foodanddrink\">Dasani was dead</a>.</p> <p>Ten years later, Coca-Cola launched a new bottled water in the UK. In the intervening decade, the industry, after a brief dip following the 2008 financial crash, had entered its hyperactive new phase. Vita Coco \u2013 one of the first of the \u201cnew\u201d waters \u2013 came to the UK in 2009, and in its wake soon appeared a flotilla of further <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/27/is-it-worth-it-coconut-water\">coconut waters</a> (the coconut water market is now worth \u00a3100m in the UK).</p> <p>The industry received a further boost this year from the former chancellor George Osborne, who announced a sugar tax on soft drinks in his final budget. As the \u201cplain\u201d bottled water market continued to expand, new inventions began to spring up. \u201cStrong established growth leads to offshoots,\u201d explained Richard Hall, chairman of Zenith International, a market research company that organises the annual and thrillingly named <a href=\"http://www.zenithinternational.com/events/205/13th%20Global%20Bottled%20Water%20Congress\">Global Bottled Water Congress</a>. Water had begun its reinvention: enter maple, birch, energy and even ocean.</p> <p>Coca-Cola\u2019s new water is called Glac\u00e9au Smartwater. The water, which comes from a spring in Morpeth, Northumberland, is \u201cvapour distilled\u201d, then injected with electrolytes. In other words, the water is evaporated and then condensed again, a process Coca-Cola describes as being \u201cinspired by the clouds\u201d.</p> <p>Ten years ago, this, surely, would have got the Peckham Spring treatment from the media. But we live in new times. Glac\u00e9au Smartwater is now worth \u00a321.9m, and, earlier this year, Coca-Cola announced an investment of \u00a315m to expand the factory where it is produced. At present, it turns out 56,000 bottles of water per hour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"79f6d67abf043635d0794b0e46dd0f65e1b3b5d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79f6d67abf043635d0794b0e46dd0f65e1b3b5d7/0_0_5016_3010/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It is no longer enough for water to simply be water: it must have special powers\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It is no longer enough for water to simply be water: it must have special powers\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Washburn/Getty Images/fStop</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>If the last decade witnessed water\u2019s great commercial expansion, 2016 could perhaps be defined as the year the market lost its mind. There now seems to be no limit on what a water can be, or what consumers are willing to buy. It is no longer enough for water to simply be water: it must have special powers.</p> <p>This summer alone saw the launch of Fl\u00f5 Essence Water, Omega Enhanced Health Water, BiPro Protein Water and Svalbar\u00f0i polar iceberg water. Other recent additions include blk. water (black water), FATwater (water containing \u201cquality fat\u201d) and deep ocean water harvested from off the coast of Hawaii (which allegedly hydrates you twice as fast as \u201cnormal\u201d water). In July, the Evening Standard ran an article that only semi-ironically described water as a \u201csuperdrink\u201d.</p> <p>Powering this proliferation of new brands is a new breed of start-upper: the water entrepreneur. I met one such man \u2013 a 27-year-old named Rahi Daneshmand \u2013 in Planet Organic on that hot August day, doling out samples of his new product, Virtue Energy Water. Virtue offers, in a 250ml can (\u00a31.35), a sugar-free sparkling water that contains \u201cyerba mat\u00e9\u201d, ginseng, citric acid, guarana and natural fruit flavours<strong>, </strong>and offers a \u201cnatural\u201d caffeine hit equivalent to a cup of coffee. It comes in two flavours, berries and lemon and lime. The response from the clientele was varied: \u201cMore fun than normal water!\u201d said one woman, taking a sip. \u201cIt\u2019s not too sweet,\u201d approved another. \u201cI\u2019m trying to avoid sweetness.\u201d Some were a little bemused. \u201cNatural caffeine? What\u2019s that?\u201d asked a younger customer. \u201cIs it for the 3pm slump or after clubbing? What\u2019s it <em>for</em>?\u201d</p> <p>Virtue is Daneshmand\u2019s big idea. In fact, it\u2019s his second big idea \u2013 after Virtue Iced Tea, which did quite well (it\u2019s stocked on Ocado). In his mind, iced tea has now been surpassed by the great hope of his new creation,<strong> </strong>which he claims is Britain\u2019s first ever naturally sugar-free energy water. Daneshmand is a committed, joyous entrepreneur. After a few childhood years in Iran, he moved back to England with his family, went to Newcastle University, and somewhere along the way picked up the look and accent of an indefatigably cheerful rugby player. He wears polo shirts, lives by mantras \u2013 \u201cnothing in life is worth getting stressed about\u201d \u2013 and is the kind of hyper-motivated person who reads two business books in a weekend. (In mid-August: Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organisation and Ego is the Enemy.)</p> <p>Daneshmand says he went into water because he wanted to make something pure. \u201cWater is something that everyone needs and something that everyone drinks,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe went with the term water because it has zero sugar.\u201d</p> <p>This, he pointed out, is not always the case. Many of the so-called \u201cwaters\u201d crowding the market are jammed with sugar. Coca-Cola\u2019s Glac\u00e9au Vitaminwater (\u201cvitamins. electrolytes. unstoppableness\u201d) used to contain 23g of sugar, until the public outcry forced the company to start swapping sugar for the sweetener stevia. (Then there was a subsequent outcry about the new taste, so it swapped back.)</p> <p>\u201cPeople are just trying to put water into everything,\u201d said Daneshmand, shaking his head. His water, from the mains supply, is subject to \u201cultra-filtration and reverse osmosis\u201d to remove minerals and make it \u201cclean\u201d. Its added ingredients are entirely natural. On this point, Daneshmand is evangelical: \u201cThat\u2019s what a water is and what a water should always be.\u201d</p> <p>One afternoon this summer, I watched Daneshmand pitch his water to Rahil Vora, managing director of the health food chain Revital. Things seemed to be going well. It was a fiercely hot day, which made any cold liquid seem appealing, and there was the happy synchrony that both Virtue and Revital had incorporated a leaf into their logo. Moreover, Vora was buying into the concept. \u201cI like the fact that it\u2019s an energy \u2018water\u2019 rather than an energy \u2018drink\u2019,\u201d he said. He liked the can, too \u2013 more environmentally friendly than a plastic bottle \u2013 and the natural ingredients, yerba mate in particular.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/gallery/2015/jul/09/where-does-your-bottled-water-come-from-in-pictures\">Where your favourite bottled water comes from \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou know about it?\u201d said Daneshmand, almost disappointed. \u201cIn south America they drink it religiously \u2013 it\u2019s their equivalent of tea.\u201d</p> <p>Vora didn\u2019t need schooling. \u201cIt\u2019s going to pick up as a trend,\u201d he said. \u201cGive it a year and you\u2019ll see it become not quite as big as green tea but \u2026 it\u2019s one of those ingredients.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d said Daneshmand. \u201cWe put the accent on the mat\u00e9 as I think people were reading it as yerba mate.\u201d</p> <p>New water samples were arriving on Vora\u2019s desk every week. \u201cIt\u2019s a fashion thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWater in a can was the craziest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Water in a can? \u201cLiterally. I got sent a box of samples. And it was just water. In a can.\u201d</p> <p>Vora shook his head in disbelief. No yerba mate, no aloe, nothing \u2013 330ml for 99p. Vora paused. \u201cFor <em>water</em>, though.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Water in a can, it turned out, was CanO water, launched by three young British entrepreneurs in January this year. I went to see them in their office in Stanmore, north London \u2013 one room, laptops, a mini basketball hoop on the wall. Ariel Booker, 24, and Perry Fielding, 29, sat opposite each other. (Their third cofounder, Josh White, was away.) Business was going well.</p> <p>Before they had formally launched, CanO had secured the right to supply London Fashion Week and a purchase order from Selfridges, which has banned all plastic bottles from its store as part of its environmental programme, Project Ocean.<strong> </strong>(CanO also managed to land a celebrity endorsement on Instagram from the model David Gandy: \u201cNo excuses not to be hydrated this summer\u201d.) By March, CanO was stocked in Whole Foods.</p> <p>I mentioned Vora\u2019s bewilderment at their product. \u201cWe have this problem on the phone,\u201d said Booker, the fast-talker, in a monochrome printed shirt and silver bracelet. \u201cWithout seeing it, it can be a bit mind-boggling! Why? What? How? When?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople just think of it as a Coke can filled with water,\u201d said Fielding, the creative, a sun tattoo on his arm and silver chain around his neck. \u201cIt seems very unexciting when you think of it like that.\u201d</p> <p>Everything changes, they believe, when you see CanO. The water, which comes from the foothills of the Austrian alps, is packaged in a minimalist black (sparkling) or white (still) can. \u201cThe visual aspect dictates everything we do,\u201d said Fielding. \u201cSo it\u2019s not just a product or a company or a drink, it\u2019s actually an aspirational brand that you\u2019d want to buy into.\u201d On the brand\u2019s Instagram feed, the cans pose sexily next to MacBook Airs, old-fashioned cameras, swimming pools and YSL handbags. Water just happens to be the thing inside.</p> <p>Fielding had the eureka moment last year while drinking a canned fizzy drink. \u201cIt just dawned on me, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be great to be able to drink water out of a <em>can</em>?\u2019\u201d The can, made of aluminium, is easily recyclable and has a resealable lid \u2013 a piece of German design that means you can put the can back in your bag without worrying about it leaking.</p> <p>\u201cI think some people look at this and think it\u2019s a gimmick,\u201d said Fielding. \u201cJust because we\u2019ve packaged it nicely doesn\u2019t actually make it a gimmick.\u201d</p> <p>The brand name, meanwhile, was their second choice. Fielding originally wanted to call the product \u201cWater\u201d, but lawyers informed him that you couldn\u2019t trademark the word that simply described the contents of the can.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4515a56908457e5888661c594714a6875cc9d5c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4515a56908457e5888661c594714a6875cc9d5c2/0_0_5016_3010/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Even those in the bottled water industry find some of the newer arrivals perplexing.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Even those in the bottled water industry find some of the newer arrivals perplexing.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Washburn/Getty Images/fStop</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The arrival of plain water in a pretty German-engineered can feels like some kind of apex, where the market\u2019s relentless demand for novelty has pushed a basic substance to its limit. We are surely only a small step from the unquestioned purchasing of emotions or air. (This, inevitably, is already happening: as Andrea Leadsom excitedly pointed out in her recent Tory party conference speech, a young British entrepreneur, Leo de Watts, now sells glass jars of Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, Welsh or Yorkshire air for \u00a380 each, mostly to the Chinese.)</p> <p>Even those in the bottled water industry find some of the newer arrivals perplexing. Everyone has their pet farce. For Ariel Booker of CanO, it was black water: \u201cWhat is the need to have water that\u2019s black?\u201d he said. \u201cThere is none.\u201d For Daneshmand, it was Rockstar, an American \u201cenergy water\u201d brand that had the same sugar volume as Red Bull (9g per 100ml). \u201cAbsolutely <em>mad</em>, that was.\u201d</p> <p>Martin Riese, whose website describes him as \u201cthe world\u2019s foremost expert on water\u201d, directs his disdain at Glac\u00e9au Smartwater: \u201cSorry, Smartwater, but you are not a premium product,\u201d he told me in his thick German accent. \u201cYou are a highly processed product and your water belongs in the trash can, nowhere else!\u201d For Riese, a purist, \u201cbottled water has to come from nature\u201d. Any kind of processing is, he believes, \u201cthe biggest scam on planet Earth!\u201d</p> <p>Riese really, really loves water. \u201cIt started for me as a very small child,\u201d he told me. \u201cI was four years old, on vacation with my parents, and I was blown away by the fact that the tap water in the city tasted differently.\u201d After school, he started working in restaurants in Germany, put together what was possibly the world\u2019s first water menu in 2005 for a Berlin bistro, and wrote a book: Die Welt des Wassers (The World of Waters). \u201cIt\u2019s a German book, so you\u2019ll have to learn to read German to read it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A bottle from the Luxury Collection Diamond Edition costs $100,000. It has a white gold cap set with over 850 diamonds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Over the years, Riese has become part of water history. After receiving his certificate as a mineral water sommelier from the German Mineral Water Trade Association, he moved to America in 2010 and became that country\u2019s first water sommelier. In 2013, he launched the longest water menu in Los Angeles at Ray\u2019s and Stark Bar, and cofounded his own brand of mineral water: Beverly Hills 90H20.</p> <p>This self-proclaimed \u201cchampagne of waters\u201d quickly won FoodBev Media\u2019s Beverage Innovation award for the \u201cWorld\u2019s Best Still or Sparkling Water\u201d. A case of 24 500ml bottles is $72, while a bottle from the \u201cLuxury Collection, Diamond Edition\u201d will cost you $100,000. It has a white gold cap set with more than 850 white and black diamonds and holds the profoundly questionable honour of being the world\u2019s most expensive bottle of water. If you buy it, Riese will present the bottle to you in person at a private water tasting anywhere in the world.</p> <p>At present, Riese sommeliers at Patina, a restaurant in the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. There, he guides the diners through his water menu, helping them to select the ideal water to accompany their meal.</p> <p>Riese talked me through his technique.</p> <p>First: \u201cDo you prefer sparkling or flat?\u201d</p> <p>Then: \u201cDo you prefer your bubbles a little bit more progressive, like very intense, or do you like your bubbles a little bit on the smaller side, like champagne bubbles, very tiny?\u201d</p> <p>Finally: \u201cDo you prefer something on the high mineral end, on the salty and bitter side, or do you prefer something on the smoother side, with a lower mineral composition, like maybe a little bit on the fruitier side?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople will tell you right away, then, what they want,\u201d said Riese. Perhaps the clientele at the Patina restaurant are better versed in the mineral composition and fruity or salty aspects of water than the rest of us. At a basic level, the taste of water varies according to the total dissolved solids (TDS) it contains. These solids can be any substance, but the key elements are sodium, magnesium and calcium. Any filtered or chemically treated tap water will usually contain fewer solids than a bottled water that still carries the minerals from the water\u2019s source, be it glacial, maple sap or spring.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2004/nov/04/water.g2\">Fiji water</a>, for example, contains 210mg/L TDS, including 18mg/L sodium, 13mg/L magnesium and 18mg/L calcium. (Fiji appears to have pulled off some fairly heavy-duty trademarking, including \u201cUntouched by man\u2122\u201d and \u201cEarth\u2019s finest water\u2122\u201d.) Compare those numbers to San Pellegrino, which contains quadruple the TDS, at 925mg/L, including 33.6mg/L sodium, 53.8mg/L magnesium and 178mg/L calcium. Fiji, with far fewer solids, tastes smoother, while the San Pellegrino is bolder, saltier and naturally fizzy.</p> <p>Nothing, however, compares to Riese\u2019s favourite water, the Slovenian spring water Roi. \u201cI\u2019m always calling it the Big Boy,\u201d said Riese. Roi has a TDS of 7,400mg/L, including more than 1,000mg/L of magnesium. For Riese, the experience of drinking this water is extraordinary, and emotional. He sits with a glass on its own \u2013 no mixer, no food, no distraction \u2013 as if he\u2019s drinking a rare cognac. \u201cThis is something very, <em>very</em> special.\u201d</p> <p>Riese knows how his obsession with water might be perceived. \u201cSome people think I\u2019m the biggest scam artist,\u201d he told me. He believes that he is simply applying the principle of wine to water \u2013<em> </em>terroir. The taste of natural water, just like wine, is affected by geography, earth, the rock it passes through. And Roi is the ultimate example: \u201cIt has way more electrolytes than Gatorade,\u201d Riese said, his voice climbing in ecstasy. \u201cThink about it! Way more electrolytes than Gatorade! But it\u2019s from Mother Nature!\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Take an investigation into the bottled water industry to its logical conclusion and you find yourself drinking melted icebergs. Last year, the Merchant hotel in Belfast launched its water menu to a global chorus of tabloid mockery. \u201cWould you pay \u00a326 for a bottle of water (even if it IS from a Canadian glacier)?\u201d ran the Daily Mail headline. Gavin Carroll, the Merchant\u2019s general manager, gave the whole episode its only possible name: Watergate. When I visited this summer to sample the menu, he still seemed a little puzzled by the reaction. \u201cWe\u2019re like, \u2018Really? It\u2019s just water.\u2019\u201d For \u00a326? \u201cWe\u2019re a five-star hotel. We have to offer our customers choice.\u201d</p> <p>The Merchant\u2019s executive chef, and the chief architect of the water menu, Patrick Leonard \u2013 a man so passionate about water that before every sip I took, I could sense him shuffling to the edge of his seat in anticipation \u2013 brought out the notorious \u00a326 bottle, called Iceberg. The water comes from the Canadian Arctic ice shelf in Newfoundland, frozen around 10,000 years ago. \u201cThey\u2019re not allowed to remove parts of icebergs,\u201d said Leonard, \u201cso they have to wait until they separate. They detach naturally, and then they\u2019re netted, brought on a boat to land and allowed to melt.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p>It\u2019s a beautiful thing, this bottle \u2013 more like a premium vodka bottle, made of thick glass, decorated with white snowflakes. Leonard poured a portion of the ancient iceberg into a tumbler. The pressure mounted; I was painfully aware that the glass of water in front of me was worth a tenner, and I still had my bottle of airport-purchased Boots\u2019 own brand on the table. I sipped, swallowed, felt the passage of liquid down my oesophagus \u2013 and couldn\u2019t taste anything at all. This was not a total failure of my unsophisticated palate. Melted iceberg essentially has no taste, having the lowest TDS (9mg/L) of any water on earth. It is like the ur-water, the water that pre-dates all other waters. \u201cThis is your starting point,\u201d said Leonard, gravely. \u201cYour baseline.\u201d</p> <p>We moved on to Whitehole Springs, a Somerset-sourced, calcium-rich still water that passes through Tufa rock; Vichy Catalan, a salty Spanish sparkler; and finally De L\u2019Aubier Sap Water, from Canada, a byproduct of the maple syrup manufacturing process.<strong> </strong>Along the way, Leonard explained the origin of his water preoccupation: a radio interview he heard with \u2013 who else? \u2013 Martin Riese: \u201cIt just got me hooked; that was it.\u201d For a chef already infatuated by taste, water was the natural extension. \u201cWe pay so much attention to food and wine, but we forget about the water,\u201d he said. His favourite? Vichy Catalan. \u201cI just had friends for dinner, and instead of bringing out the wine, I brought out three bottles of that.\u201d He looked absolutely delighted. \u201cIt was so much fun!\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to maintain cynicism in the face of a true enthusiast. Leonard loves water so much he has water parties. This is not to be mocked. And, I\u2019ll admit it, tasting this quartet of waters taught its own lesson. Pay attention, as with anything, and you notice more, appreciate more. These waters tasted dramatically different from each other, had their own peculiarities and characteristics. The maple sap water was sweet, earthy; Whitehole Springs thicker and chalky. And after the featureless purity of the melted iceberg, the Vichy Catalan was like snorting peppercorns.</p> <p>Of course, there is <a href=\"http://www.icebergwatereurope.com/home/#harvesting\">something deranged about the idea</a> of netting an iceberg and waiting for it to melt \u2013 apparently, applying heat would ruin the taste. There is also something disturbing about paying nearly \u00a330 for the experience of drinking the end result. But, for the connoisseur, all of this makes as much sense as buying a vintage claret instead of Jacob\u2019s Creek, a fillet steak instead of a Peperami.

What are we even looking for, in all these waters? The same thing, perhaps, that we are hoping to find when we buy quinoa crisps, or gluten-free seed bars: perfect health, moral relief, a sense of inner purity that somehow erases all the wine we drank last night. We want to be better people.</p> <p>The peak, however, is not in sight: for now, experts can only see growth steadily increasing in the bottled water market, at 5-6% across the industry over the next five years, according to Zenith\u2019s Richard Hall. The water entrepreneurs are yet to run out of ideas. There are waters that haven\u2019t even been thought of yet, niches still to be fully explored. Minor brands \u2013 the endless coconut waters \u2013 will fall away over time, said the water historian James Salzman, and \u201cyou\u2019ll be left with those who have survived, who will be purchased by the major players\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The water entrepreneurs are yet to run out of ideas.

Zenith have forecasted that the kids\u2019 water category is set to grow even faster than \u201cadult\u201d water. In August, Capri-Sun (owned by Coca-Cola) launched a range of juicy waters; last November, Volvic released its Star Wars collection, including bottles decorated with Chewbacca and Darth Vader; and in May this year, the first ever sparkling water for kids was launched in the US, called Tickle Water.</p> <p>According to Heather McDowell, CEO, Tickle Water was her son\u2019s idea. When he was two, he asked for a sip of her sparkling water, loved it, \u201cand the next day he was like, \u2018Mommy, I want tickle water!\u2019\u201d she told me enthusiastically. Tickle Water comes in a transparent plastic can with an aluminium lid. \u201cSo the kids can feel like they\u2019re drinking a soda because it looks like a soda can, but the parents feel good because they see that it\u2019s clear, plain, transparent water.\u201d</p> <p>For McDowell, if making water look like Coke means kids drink more water and less Coke, this can only be a good thing. True, undoubtedly, but somehow it feels like the final twist in water\u2019s elaborate rebrand, the last stop on a journey that starts with turning on a tap and marvelling that something clean, healthy and potable comes out, and then pauses \u2013 for years \u2013 to watch an iceberg melt very, very slowly, and ends with a child drinking \u201ccola\u201d water (one of Tickle Water\u2019s natural flavours), because he likes the style of the can.</p> <p>From element to commodity, we finally got there: welcome to the age of Water\u2122. </p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was corrected on 7 October and 8 November 2016.

The return of class politics is an opportunity for Labour \u2013 and also a looming existential crisis.</p> <p>Labour was founded to be the political arm of the working class. Social democracy across the western world existed to offer these wealth creators political representation, and to reorder societies otherwise run in the interests of industrialists and landlords. But the party emerged when working-class Britain toiled as steelworkers, miners, factory workers, personal servants. The workforce was dominated by men, and it was overwhelmingly white. Communities centred around places of work.</p> <p>The left in general had a clear message: the problems and insecurities you experience are byproducts of a society that puts profit ahead of your needs and ambitions. Those responsible for injustice are those with power. Injustice is a collective failing that needs a collective solution.</p> <p>It is all more complicated these days. The rise of the new right in the 1970s promoted individualism as the antidote to a supposedly suffocating collectivism. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/04/end-of-council-housing-bill-secure-tenancies-pay-to-stay\">mass sale of council housing</a> was intended to promote individual over collective identity: \u201cembourgeoisement\u201d \u2013 or becoming bourgeois \u2013 as Margaret Thatcher\u2019s \u201cmad monk\u201d Keith Joseph put it.</p> <p>Trade unions \u2013 which gave organised power to a large swath of working-class Britain \u2013 were battered by government policies, mass unemployment and industrial defeat. The old industrial working class gave way to a more fragmented service-sector workforce. University-educated public-sector workers and middle-class professionals grew in number: they abhorred the social conservatism of the Tories, but had a different set of values and priorities to traditional working-class Britain, introducing a new tension in Labour\u2019s electoral coalition.</p> <p>How the end of the cold war was spun \u2013 total victory for free-market capitalism \u2013 led to a collapse in the left\u2019s vision and confidence. Mass immigration diversified working-class Britain \u2013 indeed, it is working-class communities that tend to be the most ethnically mixed \u2013 but also led to unchecked resentment. New Labour\u2019s failure to undo the social dislocation of Thatcherism \u2013 for example, overseeing a continued collapse in manufacturing jobs, and improving existing housing but failing to build more \u2013 led to growing frustrations. The left had no clear, accessible explanation about growing social insecurities: anti-immigration resentment filled the vacuum.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyns-labour-conference-speech-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/553fe\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2758226\"            data-video-name=\"Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour conference speech - video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ebee65e4b01b56deffc4f8\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/28/160928corbyncongress_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/28/160928corbyncongress.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/28/160928corbyncongress_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyns-labour-conference-speech-video-highlights\"> \u2018Jeremy Corbyn toyed with progressive patriotism in his leader\u2019s speech; he should persist with that and he must be positive.\u2019 </a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s now clear that a return to class politics was inevitable. A financial elite plunged the country into its worst economic crisis since the 1930s, suppressing the living standards of millions who shared no blame for it. A Conservative government dominated by public school millionaires introduced policies that damaged the lives of those from strikingly less privileged backgrounds. Workers suffered the longest real fall in wages <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/27/uk-joins-greece-at-bottom-of-wage-growth-league-tuc-oecd\">since the 19th century</a>, while the richest 1,000 Britons experienced a doubling in wealth. And then the Brexit vote happened: who can credibly claim \u201cwe\u2019re all middle-class\u201d in its aftermath? Working-class Britain is not homogeneous, and millions of working-class people \u2013 particularly from black and minority ethnic backgrounds \u2013 voted to remain. But there is no escaping the fact that middle-class professionals were the only demographic with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/07/north-poor-brexit-myths\">majority support for remain</a>, or that those on lower incomes plumped decisively for Brexit.</p> <p>And here is the danger, one that has long caused me deep concern.</p> <p>Six years ago, in the book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/08/chavs-demonization-owen-jones-review\">Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class</a>, I wrote: \u201cThe danger is of a savvy new populist right emerging, one that is comfortable talking about class and offers reactionary solutions to working-class problems. It could denounce the demonisation of the working class and the trashing of its identity. It could claim that the traditional party of working-class people, the Labour party, has turned its back on them.</p> <p>\u201cRather than focusing on the deep-seated economic issues that really underpin the grievances of working-class people, it could train its populist guns on immigration and cultural issues. Immigrants could be blamed for economic woes; multiculturalism could be blasted for undermining \u2018white\u2019 working-class identity.\u201d It doesn\u2019t seem far between that and a populist prime minister who says: the enemies of working-class Britain are immigration and a metropolitan liberal elite with contempt for their patriotism and values.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/07/angry-remain-voter-working-class-division-britain\">Angry remain voter?

Theresa May knows this and, rhetorically at least, as she reinforced in her speech yesterday, she is abandoning support for it in favour of an active state. This could be lethally effective. It also underlines why the old New Labour approach \u2013 the wedding of economic and social liberalism \u2013 is irrelevant.</p> <p>That is of little comfort to today\u2019s Labour leadership. University-educated middle-class professionals may take to Twitter to vent, but it is their cultural distance from working-class communities that May seeks to exploit. Thatcherism attracted working-class support with carrots such as right-to-buy; today Mayism seeks to bind together an electoral coalition with resentment of immigration and metropolitan elites. May\u2019s government is seeking a harsh Brexit that is set to damage the living standards and security of working-class people. If Labour doesn\u2019t present a clear and compelling alternative vision, then frustration at the reality of Brexit will be funnelled into even more intense anti-immigration anger.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn toyed with progressive patriotism in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/29/jeremy-corbyn-conference-speech-labour-leader-panel\">leader\u2019s speech</a>; he should persist with that and he must be positive. For as Labour thinker Jon Cruddas has pointed out, the party wins when it presents an optimistic vision of national reconstruction.</p> <p>There is anti-establishment fury. It underpinned the Brexit result and Labour must tap into it. But unlike the Tories, it must direct this towards the correct targets, the vested interests who are really holding Britain back.</p> <p>Labour was born of class politics, whose re-emergence is an opportunity. But if Labour fails to grasp it, be sure that the populist right will.</p>",

Trump, who might be the most ostentatiously unqualified major-party candidate in the 227-year history of the American presidency.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton - the third recipient of the Atlantic\u2019s endorsement after Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson - \u201chas flaws (some legitimately troubling, some exaggerated by her opponents), but she is among the most prepared candidates ever to seek the presidency.\u201d Trump, on the other hand, \u201chas no record of public service and no qualifications for public office.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis affect is that of an infomercial huckster,\u201d the editorial seethes. \u201cHe traffics in conspiracy theories and racist invective; he is appallingly sexist; he is erratic, secretive, and xenophobic; he expresses admiration for authoritarian rulers, and evinces authoritarian tendencies himself. He is easily goaded, a poor quality for someone seeking control of America\u2019s nuclear arsenal. He is an enemy of fact-based discourse; he is ignorant of, and indifferent to, the Constitution; he appears not to read.\u201d</p> <p>In the Atlantic\u2019s mind, Trump disqualified himself for the presidency five years before he ever considered running for office, in his tight embrace of the so-called \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy that (baselessly) alleged that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States and was therefore constitutionally ineligible to serve as president:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trump made himself the face of the so-called birther movement, which had as its immediate goal the demonization of the country\u2019s first African American president. Trump\u2019s larger goal, it seemed, was to stoke fear among white Americans of dark-skinned foreigners. He succeeded wildly in this; the fear he has aroused has brought him one step away from the presidency.</p> </blockquote> <p>Trump, the editorial concludes, \u201cis not a man of ideas,\u201d but \u201ca demagogue, a xenophobe, a sexist, a know-nothing, and a liar. He is spectacularly unfit for office, and voters - the statesmen and thinkers of the ballot box - should act in defense of American democracy and elect his opponent.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f554cfe4b024298f91dba1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T19:31:57.962Z\">8.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back to Henderson, Nevada:</strong></p> <p>On the subject of Russian president Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump tells the crowd in Henderson that despite Virginia senator and Democratic running mate Tim Kaine\u2019s allegations last night - and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/trump-putin-senate-republicans-marco-rubio-john-mccain\">his own fawning comments</a> about the Russian strongman - he doesn\u2019t \u201clove\u201d Putin.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t love, I don\u2019t hate,\u201d Trump says. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it works - we\u2019ll see.

Founded in 1999 as a way to bolster the stuttering economy of the south-western New South Wales town, the muster has grown into a two-day, all-purpose celebration of rural and regional Australian culture that attracts tens of thousands of people each year over the NSW Labor day and Victoria AFL grand final eve long weekend.</p> <p>To get a proper feel of things, I\u2019d driven to the muster in a rented Toyota Hilux dual-cab ute \u2013 a monstrous thing that, like a surly horse, seemed to sense it was being handled by an amateur. </p> <p>Deniliquin, a 750km drive from Sydney, sits at the western edge of the Riverine Plain, one of the largest natural flats in the world. In the lead-up to the festival the plain was buffeted by remnants of the colossal storm that knocked out power across South Australia, and historically drought-stricken areas were utterly waterlogged. Every two-bit dried creek bed was swollen past bursting. Great sheets of water covered roads and fields, stands of trees rearing out of the floodwater like giant hydroponic experiments.<br></p> <p>As a result, the traditionally dust-dry grounds of the muster have become a swamp, acres of clotted, sucking mud that stretch for miles. Imagine the largest, wettest outdoor music festival you\u2019ve ever been to. Now put 10,000 large vehicles on top of it, many of them driven with the express purpose of churning up as much mud as possible, and you may have an accurate mental picture of the 2016 Deni Ute Muster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0270d83d7a9fb26b55b8423052619de621c5b49a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0270d83d7a9fb26b55b8423052619de621c5b49a/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dropped keys and wedding rings vanish instantly, swallowed by the lake of mud soup, but the crushed cans of beer and UDL will find their way to the surface by dint of their sheer number.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dropped keys and wedding rings vanish instantly, swallowed by the lake of mud soup, but the crushed cans of beer and UDL will find their way to the surface by dint of their sheer number.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zowie Crump</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it frequently does, the Ute Muster has put an impressive entertainment schedule together. Keith Urban, Australian Crawl\u2019s James Reyne and Troy Cassar-Daley are headlining. There are rodeo, woodchopping and whipcracking championships, a circus and rides for the kids, and a fireworks display on the closing night. The AFL grand final is broadcast on the main stage, and the yearly attempt to break the Guinness World Record for the most people wearing blue singlets in one place falls valiantly short of the 3,960 required.</p> <p>But the organisers couldn\u2019t have anticipated the severity of the mudbath. The mud creeps into sleeping bags and underwear, into mobile phones and food. Everywhere there are scenes of sodden carnage. A Mazda3 hatchback, cartoonishly outsized by the Brobdingnagian trucks around it, wallows helplessly in a mud pool, its engine bellowing like a dying buffalo. Dropped keys and wedding rings vanish instantly, swallowed by the lake of mud soup the fairground has become. </p> <p>The only objects that will ever be seen again, forced back to the surface world by their sheer number, are the crushed cans of beer and UDL that blanket the ground, mummified in mud like Pompeii relics.</p> <p>The heart of the festival rests with the thousands of utes arrayed on a vast stretch of ground adjacent to the festival area, appropriately called \u201cthe ute paddock\u201d. Separate campsites are set aside for families, campervans, trailers and four-wheel drives, but the ute paddock stands apart. Only utes are permitted inside and usually it is where the festival\u2019s serious business of inspecting, comparing and celebrating utes gets done.</p> <p>This year, though, things are a little different. The rain, the stomping of gumboots and the endless spinning of wheels has turned the ute paddock into a gunk-soaked slum, and sent its inhabitants slightly loopy. Giving in to the hopelessness of trying to stay clean, people embrace the filth with the enthusiasm of converts to some maddened new religion. People sleep next to their utes, or in them, or on them. They huddle around fires in oil drums like homeless men in cartoons. Men rub their heads furiously against the ground, lathering themselves in muck. Their mates roaring with approval, they scull beer from mud-caked gumboots.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"862ba776eceb6c858fa92d275d1a6a30b2183962\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/862ba776eceb6c858fa92d275d1a6a30b2183962/0_0_6206_4142/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two women battle it out with an inflatable dinghy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two women battle it out with an inflatable dinghy, \u2018maintaining a heroic grip on their drinks\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zowie Crump</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Driving through the ute paddock in an open buggy turns into a cross between a scene from Jurassic Park and one from Apocalypse Now. A knot of cheering punters surrounds us, trying to tie an inflatable dinghy on to the back of the buggy with a rope to hitch a free ride. Two women\u2019s efforts to sit in the dinghy turn into a pratfall routine that goes on for minutes. By the end they are invisible, capsized in the mud with the dinghy on top of them, somehow maintaining a heroic grip on their drinks. Seeing my camera, one young man demands I stop and film him chewing the top off a beer can. I obey, on some level glad I left my reading glasses in the car.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0ee582a40f18f5c8817cb16c4bdd5e6d318767ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ee582a40f18f5c8817cb16c4bdd5e6d318767ca/2067_637_4609_4275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The drum making up his head bears a flattened, unsettlingly specific likeness of a human face\u2019: the oil drum statue guarding the entrance of the entertainment area at Deni.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"928\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The drum making up his head bears a flattened, unsettlingly specific likeness of a human face\u2019: the oil drum statue guarding the entrance of the entertainment area at Deni.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zowie Crump</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The other half of the festival is slightly less surreal, though not for lack of trying. </p> <p>The entrance to the entertainment area is guarded by a giant statue made out of oil drums, a larger-than-life farmer in requisite blue singlet and cowboy hat. He is unremarkable except when, on closer inspection, you notice the drum making up his head bears a flattened, unsettlingly specific likeness of a human face. It looks as though someone\u2019s soul has been trapped inside the statue, like a golem, and is trying to get out. </p> <p>Also, someone has wedged a crushed beer can into the gap between his legs and his torso, giving him a vestigial metal penis.</p> <p>In a huge circular pit arena, ute drivers do what they came to do: make a lot of noise in their utes. One at a time utes enter, roar and skid across the mud like deranged ice skaters, and leave the way they came. This practice is called circle work, and it is highly regarded. The object is to drift around the arena making giant donuts and figure eights that can be judged, but due to the mud contestants are happy to make as much mess as possible while not getting stuck. Eventually the mud is declared victorious, and the circle work is prematurely shut down.<br></p> <p>By late afternoon on the second day the sun is out, and something resembling normality has begun to surface. Familiar scenes start to play out. On one of the side stages, a local covers band launches into Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again by the Angels. When they sing the chorus\u2019s single line the refrain comes back from the crowd, as inevitable as the tides: \u201cNo way, get fucked, fuck off!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9c0bbad5bc504e903a5d95a4b81b14828269ba79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c0bbad5bc504e903a5d95a4b81b14828269ba79/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Circle work at the Deni Ute Muster 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This practice is called circle work, and it is highly regarded\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zowie Crump</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But insanity will have the last say. Over at the main stage, as it becomes apparent the Western Bulldogs have won their first premiership flag in 62 years, the large crowd watching the AFL grand final descends into delirium. When the final siren goes men joyously dive face-first into the slop, wrap each other in bear hugs, fling handfuls of mud into the sky. A young man in a Bulldogs jersey and an Akubra hat who has been the picture of hyper-masculine bravado for two hours bends double with his face in his hands, quietly racked with sobs. </p> <p>As the sun goes down, the revellers return to their tents and their drinking, and wait for the music to start.</p>"
