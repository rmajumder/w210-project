Thanks very much for everyone who\u2019s read it and commented. It\u2019s hard to know which Dylan song to finish on, so I\u2019m going to choose the coruscating Idiot Wind from Blood on the Tracks, eight minutes of some of the most breathtaking musical vitriol ever recorded. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/our-favorite-dylan-lyrics?intcid=mod-latest\">The New Yorker has just published a great piece in which its writers discuss their favourite Dylan lyrics</a>. Rebecca Mead picks this song. She writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I\u2019m glad to say that it\u2019s been a while since I felt a personal identification with Idiot Wind, but the furious castigation and the reeling pain conveyed by that song have spoken for me more times than I care to recall. Critics will argue about Dylan\u2019s place in the canon, or about the rightness of bestowing a prize upon a writer whose celebration doesn\u2019t particularly help the publishing industry. But, for my money, anyone who can summon, as a bitter valediction to a lover, the line \u201cI can\u2019t even touch the books you\u2019ve read,\u201d knows\u2014and captures, and incarnates\u2014the power of literature.<br></p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/20729562\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/20729562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fff5dbe4b01ffb8ffcb6e9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T21:02:34.846Z\">10.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The legendary music journalist Everett True emails to say he has written some thoughts on Dylan\u2019s award.

He is not of those communities by origin, but he has embraced them so deeply and consistently through his six-decade career that he speaks on their behalf with clarity, conviction and authenticity.

So much of the pleasure I get from Dylan, on the other hand, derives from the voice singing those lyrics. He was never more moving than the decade when his larynx turned into a rusted carburetor; he sang like a carping vulture, and I loved it. <br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ffd450e4b047a4eaafc33f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T18:58:47.595Z\">7.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are plenty of music writers on Facebook debating Dylan\u2019s win. One of them is our Chicago-based country music writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mark-guarino\">Mark Guarino</a>, who has given me permission to quote from his post in defence of Dylan\u2019s win, which is being shared a lot. He writes:</p> <ol> <li>Lyrics are not meant to outlast the music. Dylan\u2019s do. His work fundamentally changed the art form. Today the marketing people would call him a \u201cdisrupter\u201d and a \u201cchange agent.\u201d His use of language is profound, playful and instinctual. Somehow he developed pop music that works well in the back of a bar, but at the same time you can disappear inside the songs and let them work their magic. As great poetry does.</li> <li>He has a body of work that stretches more than 50 years, which is much longer than most contemporary novelists, poets, painters. Even his so-called \u201cbad\u201d period in the 80s contained some of his most evocative writing (Oh Mercy). Joni Mitchell, Smokey Robinson and many others created great work but within very specific time periods. Dylan never stopped. Some of his late career work stands firmly up against Blonde on Blonde. More incredibly, despite great fame he was able to sit down again and again and write with a true eye, which isn\u2019t easy to do. Ask any number of your classic rockers who stopped decades ago.</li> <li>Dylan\u2019s songs live as both highbrow and lowbrow. His fans span truck drivers to Ivy League academics. His songs have meaning to people who heard them in the Woodstock era and to those who heard them during the first Iraq war. There are people who attend his concerts to pump their fists in the air and there are others who quietly count the syllables. For a body of work to be so pliable is the very definition of great literature.</li> <li>Shakespeare wrote plays that have been turned into music, movies, and are performed in garages to great halls. Are not songs simply internal monologues that are sung? Are some novels poetry and some chapbooks novels? Literature is ultimately about the language, not the genre.</li> <li>This prize is affirmation that pop culture can aspire to, and achieve, high art. People thought pop music was for children before Dylan and the Beatles showed up. He fused the folk revival with pop to steer things in a new direction. Now songwriters can aspire to greatness far outside the commercial realm. Indeed into one where so-called \u201cserious\u201d literature exists. \u201cHits\u201d have little to do with what he left behind.</li> <li>Dylan is a humanist. Like Tennessee Williams, he sees our folly. Dylan\u2019s lyrics reflect both deep nihilism about the human state of affairs and sometimes idealism about human encounters, one-on-one.

Could the subtext be that this is Sweden\u2019s way of marking the passing of David Bowie?</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Does BD really deserve the prize?<br><strong>Danius: </strong>Of course he does, he just got it. He is a great poet. He is a great poet in the English-speaking tradition and he is a wonderful sampler, a very original sampler, he embodies the tradition and for 55, 54 years now he\u2019s been at it and re-inventing himself constantly. Re-inventing himself creating a new identity.<strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Have you talked to him today?<br><strong>Danius: </strong>No, I haven\u2019t. I will afterwards.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> He\u2019s not a person who is nice and smiley when he gets awards. That doesn\u2019t worry you?<br><strong>Danius: </strong>No, I think I have a good message.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Do you have personal favourites among his songs?<br><strong>Danius: </strong>I think if you want to start listening, or reading, you may start with Blonde on Blonde, the album from 1966. You\u2019ve got many classics and it\u2019s an extraordinary example of his brilliant way of rhyming and putting together refrains and his pictorial thinking.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> He\u2019s not written novels, not poetry in the usual sense, you have widened the horizon.<br><strong>Danius: </strong>It may look that way but really we haven\u2019t in a way if you look back, far back, 2500 years or so, you discover Homer and Sappho and they wrote poetic texts that were meant to be listened to. They were meant to be performed, often together with instruments, and it\u2019s the same way with Bob Dylan. But we still read Homer and Sappho and we enjoyed it [sic], we enjoy it and the same thing with Bob Dylan he can be read and should be read and he is a great poet in the English tradition, in the grand English poetic tradition.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you think there will be criticism against this prize?<br><strong>Danius: </strong>I hope not [smiles]. </p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>When you were young and into pop rock music, which I guess you were, did you listen a lot to Bob Dylan?<br><strong>Danius: </strong>Not really, but he was always around, so I know the music. I\u2019ve started to appreciate him much more now than I did. I was a big David Bowie fan. Perhaps it is a question of generation, I don\u2019t know. But today I\u2019m a lover of Bob Dylan. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T15:11:57.874Z\">at 4.11pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ff9d9fe4b01ffb8ffcb548\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T14:46:16.978Z\">3.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Message to Bob, ring Sweden</h2> <p>Still no word from Bob Dylan himself.

Dylan is young, and admits it. He is naive and implies it at stations along his particular line.

The same was said of Pound, Auden and MacNeice; the same is true to day of poets like Christopher Logue, Adrian Mitchell and George MacBeth. The difference is that Dylan is not a readers\u2019 poet: some but by no means all of his verse is able to stand by itself but more commonly it needs musical backing and the strangely dry, bitter quality of his voice to supply the dimension that other poets derive from literal organisation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T14:39:40.041Z\">at 3.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ff9579e4b01ffb8ffcb511\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T14:15:24.065Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Joyce Carol Oates puts her voice behind Dylan:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoyceCarolOates/status/786565703411175430\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Asked about Nobel for Dylan: inspired &amp; original choice. his haunting music &amp; lyrics have always seemed, in the deepest sense, &quot;literary.&quot;</p>&mdash; Joyce Carol Oates (@JoyceCarolOates) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoyceCarolOates/status/786565703411175430\">October 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Meanwhile discussion is turning to which other songwriters might have merited a Nobel.

It has enraged the Scottish nationalists.

The delegates whooped at the announcement because many of them long for a rerun of the independence vote in September 2014, albeit with a different outcome, and perhaps even thought that was what the first minister had offered. But it is important to understand what Sturgeon didn\u2019t say to them, as well as what she did.</p> <p>Sturgeon did not fire the starting gun on a second independence referendum today. She doesn\u2019t want <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/02/scots-independence-referendum-brexit-nicola-sturgeon\" title=\"\">a second vote</a> unless she thinks she can win it. At the moment she can\u2019t do that. The current polling \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/14798246.Hard_Brexit_is_not_a_game_changer_for_SNP__new_poll_suggests/?commentSort=score\" title=\"\">the latest example was BMG\u2019s poll in the Herald on Friday</a> \u2013 all counsels caution. And, beneath the apparent bravado, caution is what the SNP leader offered.</p> <p>Her words tell that story for anyone who cares to read them carefully. \u201cI am determined,\u201d she said, \u201cthat Scotland will have the ability to reconsider the question of independence \u2013 and to do so before the UK leaves the EU \u2013 if that is necessary to protect our country\u2019s interests.\u201d Sturgeon gave herself more get-out-of-jail options in her speech than she would have had in an open&#xa0;prison.</p> <p>What she actually said elsewhere in her speech is important too. It\u2019s not often you hear a Scottish nationalist leader make an apparently serious offer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/nicola-sturgeon-to-reach-out-to-other-parties-to-fight-hard-brexit\" title=\"\">\u201ccoalition\u201d to Labour, Lib Dem and even moderate Tory leaders</a>. But that\u2019s not what Sturgeon did. She set out a list of Scottish aims, including devolved powers and access to the single market, that are predicated on remaining in the UK, not on breaking free of it, and which can only be achieved with support from others at Westminster. It\u2019s why she said: \u201cToday I want to concentrate on what we will do in the months ahead to protect the interests of Scotland and \u2013 in so far as we can \u2013 of the UK as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>This is in part a tactical stance too, of course. When Sturgeon says the ball is in May\u2019s court she is looking for, perhaps even hoping for, May to overreach again. The SNP are past masters at framing issues in such heads-we-win-tails-you-lose ways. But the pragmatic side of Sturgeon also sees the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/brexit-mps-david-davis-eu-exit-plan\" title=\"\">gathering pressure</a> this week for the UK parliament to shape the Brexit process as a chance to achieve serious gains for Scotland without the very real danger of a lost second referendum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/02/scots-independence-referendum-brexit-nicola-sturgeon\">How do Scots feel about having another independence referendum, post-Brexit? | David Torrance, Vonny Moyes and Mike Small</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One reason why Sturgeon needs to do this is because she is not now quite as popular these days as either her Scottish or her English admirers imagine. It\u2019s not just that Brexit has failed to generate the support for independence that many expected. It\u2019s also that Sturgeon\u2019s own satisfaction ratings among Scots have fallen sharply, <a href=\"https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3781/Brexit-does-not-trigger-significant-increase-in-support-for-independence.aspx\" title=\"\">down by 12 points since April</a>. She now trails the Tories\u2019 Ruth Davidson on satisfaction. The inference is that it is time for Sturgeon to deliver.</p> <p>It is easy to see why some people on both sides of the border have convinced themselves that England and Wales\u2019s Brexit vote might trigger Scotland\u2019s departure from the United Kingdom. Even now, it\u2019s not an outcome that can be wholly dismissed. But the claim is beginning to look seriously incompatible with the facts. Intriguingly, an opposite dynamic may now be the one to watch. Far from separating Scotland from Britain, Brexit may be drawing Scottish nationalism into the heart of British politics in a new&#xa0;and&#xa0;unexpected way.</p> <p>Much of this is down to May\u2019s determined embrace of Brexit and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/take-back-control-brexiteers-immigration-policy-johnson-davis-fox\" title=\"\">appointment of the Brexiteers</a> to key posts in the government. What seemed tactically adept <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/16/johnson-davis-fox-three-brexiteers\" title=\"\">in the summer</a> now seems more of a ball and chain, largely because of the studied vagueness of the government\u2019s strategy. But the real catalyst is the gradual dissolution of economic confidence across the UK.</p> <p>Those who said that the foreign exchange markets were the only real opposition to the May government may have had a point a week ago. But a lot has changed in a week. The continuing slide in the pound, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/11/hard-brexit-treasury-66bn-eu-single-market\" title=\"\">the \u00a366bn annual price tag for a hard Brexit</a>, and then the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/great-marmite-war-reality-brexit-bite\" title=\"\">temporary disappearance of Marmite from Tesco shelves</a> all added to the sense that the May government is fiddling while British business burns. Public opinion has not had remorse about the referendum result yet, but that may change, opening up some political space for&#xa0;opponents&#xa0;of&#xa0;Brexit.</p> <p>This presents a real rallying opportunity for pro-European and soft-Brexit forces alike. Sturgeon sniffs that opportunity. But the battle will be fought at Westminster, not Holyrood. This is uncomfortable from an SNP perspective; the party is always happiest haranguing from its home base at Holyrood, not wheeling and dealing at distant Westminster. But the votes and the power to change things are at Westminster and Whitehall. The election this week of the party\u2019s Westminster leader <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37640935\" title=\"\">Angus Robertson as Sturgeon\u2019s new deputy</a> is another reminder that the centre of gravity of Scottish politics has in some ways been shifting to London since 2015.</p> <p>The big question is whether the opposition parties and the moderate Tories at Westminster have the programme, as well as the votes, to change the May government\u2019s direction on Brexit. At this early stage, they have shown they have the power to put a divided government\u2019s nose out of joint. Now they have to agree some shared red lines and to mobilise to promote them at every turn. That will be harder. It will involve creativity, as well as give and take. But the phoney war on Brexit is over, and British politics has at long last got real&#xa0;once&#xa0;again.</p>",

  "<p>\u2018Black film properties may be to the 90s what the carphone was to the 80s; every studio executive has to have one,\u201d wrote the New York Times magazine in the summer of 1991. It\u2019s a comment that speaks volumes about both a cultural moment and its transience. The piece was titled They\u2019ve Gotta Have Us, referring to Spike Lee\u2019s 1986 breakthrough movie She\u2019s Gotta Have It. The group portrait on the cover brought together an impressive collection of young, black film-makers \u2013 what has been labelled \u201cthe class of 91\u201d. Lee was head boy, of course. By that time he was well into a creative blaze that would continue at the rate of practically a film a year: Do the Right Thing (1989), Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990), Jungle Fever (1991), Malcolm X (1992), Crooklyn (1994), Clockers (1995).</p> <p>There was also Lee\u2019s friend Ernest Dickerson, the cinematographer who made Do the Right Thing sizzle, and who was now directing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/13/hip-hop-cinema-dickerson-juice\">his own Harlem hood tale, Juice</a>. There was Mario Van Peebles, maker of first-rate gangster thriller New Jack City. There were the Hudlin brothers, Warrington and Reginald, makers of hit teen comedy House Party. There were Charles Lane and 20-year-old Matty Rich, whose debut movies had won prizes at Cannes and Sundance, respectively.</p> <p>And the breakout star of the moment was John Singleton, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/13/john-singleton-filmmaker-boyz-n-the-hood-special-screening-academy\">autobiographical Los Angeles drama Boyz N the Hood</a> had earned him a three-year studio deal, and would make him the first African-American, and the youngest-ever best director Oscar nominee. \u201cThe current crop is breaking new ground in their subject matter and their politics,\u201d the article observed. \u201cFor the studios, these are tales from a new world, presented with an often harrowing, if occasionally hyperbolic, realism.\u201d The film-makers themselves seemed sensibly cautious of being lumped into a moment. \u201cIf one black film-maker messes up,\u201d said Lee, \u201cthe rest of us will be made to feel it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/13/john-singleton-filmmaker-boyz-n-the-hood-special-screening-academy\">John Singleton reflects on Boyz N the Hood: 'I didn't know anything'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The caution was justified. Fast forward 25 years or so, and we\u2019re faced with a situation where, for the second year running, not a single actor of colour received an Oscar nomination; where African-Americans are still complaining of under-representation within film and television \u2013 when they\u2019re not taking to the streets to remind the country that their lives matter. Did someone mess up?</p> <p>One thing is for sure: looking back, the 90s was a golden age. The amount of black cinema breaking through at that time is astonishing. Hip-hop, and white audiences\u2019 interest in it, fed into the movement. Rappers and musicians seamlessly transitioned into film: Ice Cube, Ice-T, Tupac Shakur, Queen Latifah. It wasn\u2019t just youthful \u201chood dramas\u201d, however; there was quality work across the spectrum. Serious thrillers such as Devil in a Blue Dress and Deep Cover, appeared alongside arthouse-friendly fare from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Rebellion\">\u201cLA Rebellion\u201d group</a>. This film-schooled movement generated influential works such as Charles Burnett\u2019s To Sleep With Anger and Julie Dash\u2019s Daughters of the Dust, released in 1991, the first feature directed by an African-American woman to get theatrical distribution across the US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1269fb1c77f71aba83c69c78efe180431b766e22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1269fb1c77f71aba83c69c78efe180431b766e22/0_0_2742_1813/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ice Cube in Boyz N the Hood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ice Cube in Boyz N the Hood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Columbia/Sportsphoto/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On television, too, African-American content seemed to be crossing over. Will Smith figuratively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/17/the-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-when-the-mainstream-met-afrocentric-style\">sauntered into Hollywood in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air</a>, while Jamie Foxx cut his teeth on the Wayans brothers\u2019 sketch show, In Living Color. If you bothered to flick over from Friends or Seinfeld, you could find black-led series such as Moesha, A Different World, Family Matters, Kenan and Kel, Martin (as in Lawrence), Queen Latifah\u2019s Living Single, Sister Sister and Malcolm &amp; Eddie.</p> <p>For the first time, mainstream cinema and TV audiences were getting honest, intelligent portrayals of both modern African-American life and US history from a black perspective \u2013 the type of stories only black film-makers could tell. The revolution was being televised, dramatised, publicised and eulogised.</p> <p>It is worth remembering that it was only three years earlier, in 1987, that Robert Townsend had made the cult satire <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Shuffle\">Hollywood Shuffle</a>, which detailed the futile struggle of an aspiring black actor, and feels as if it is from a completely different era. \u201cThe only role they gonna let us do is a slave, a butler or some street hood,\u201d a fellow auditionee tells Townsend\u2019s character. White producers say they\u2019re looking for an \u201cEddie Murphy type\u201d, and ask him to \u201cbe more black\u201d. In his daydreams, Townsend fantasises about playing a film-noir sleuth, a Shakespearean king, a superhero, even a black Rambo. Instead, he wins the role of a stereotypical, jive-talking street hood, which only conjures visions of protesters picketing his house, accusing him of selling out. As an NAACP spokesman puts it: \u201cThey\u2019ll never play the Rambos until they stop playing the sambos.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb002bc31e483da3c3d07c76ab3dbec175ecbae6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb002bc31e483da3c3d07c76ab3dbec175ecbae6/0_0_4000_2727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jimmy Woodward and Robert Townsend in Hollywood Shuffle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jimmy Woodward and Robert Townsend in Hollywood Shuffle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But by the mid-90s, Townsend\u2019s wildest dreams had become reality. Now, you could be a black Shakespearean (Denzel Washington in <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1045992-much_ado_about_nothing/\">Much Ado About Nothing</a>), or a black superhero (Wesley Snipes in Blade), or, if not quite Rambo, at least a black action hero (Will Smith in Bad Boys).</p> <p>The fruit of that 90s creative flowering was a generation of African-American performers who gained real Hollywood power: the power to take leading roles, to win awards and, ultimately, to get movies greenlit. Most of them were men, which tells its own story, and most of them still wield that power today: Washington, Smith, Foxx, Samuel L Jackson. But it was also the era when Angela Bassett became the first black women in more than a decade to get a best actress Oscar nomination (for the Tina Turner biopic What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It?) and Whitney Houston powered hits such as The Bodyguard and (alongside Bassett) Waiting to Exhale.</p> <p>But did that success come at a cost? The actors were getting the roles, but their movies weren\u2019t necessarily \u201cblack\u201d stories. More often than not, they became token black faces in otherwise business-as-usual Hollywood movies \u2013 exceptions that proved the rule, you could say. One moment Will Smith might be Muhammad Ali, for example, but the next he would be \u201cmagical negro\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/feb/23/culture.peterbradshaw\">golf caddy Bagger Vance</a>. Meanwhile, the film-makers that had helped put them there seemed to get left behind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaaebe1b69df0583e55d670a47834bcc61b3abbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaaebe1b69df0583e55d670a47834bcc61b3abbf/0_0_2464_1677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tracy Camilla Johns and Spike Lee in She\u2019s Gotta Have It.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tracy Camilla Johns and Spike Lee in She\u2019s Gotta Have It.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Island/Everett/REX/Shutterstock/Island/Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s easy to forget just what a struggle they had had. Townsend had to max out credit cards and scavenge leftover film stock to cobble together Hollywood Shuffle. It took Lee four years to raise $175,000 to make She\u2019s Gotta Have It, in a brisk 12 days. Lee even encouraged his crew to save their drinks cans so he could cash them in for recycling. One upshot of these shoestring budgets was that these films became hugely profitable when they broke through. It was arguably that profitability, rather than any cultural mission, that caught Hollywood\u2019s attention.</p> <p>A big part of the problem, says Julie Dash, was that black cinema\u2019s ascent coincided with Hollywood\u2019s takeover of independent cinema as a whole. \u201cIt became a commodity that could be co-opted by the larger industry. We broke through, and once the curators of culture recognised that we were actively making films in our own way, it suddenly just slowed down to a halt. Funding ran out for pretty much everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Dash\u2019s Daughters of the Dust was one of the unsung highlights of this era. It deals with Dash\u2019s own <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullah\">Gullah community</a>, descended from slaves who settled on the coast of North Carolina, but it does so with a unique sensibility, weaving together three generations of female characters with music, dance, folk storytelling and lyrical imagery. She describes it as \u201chistory reframed, reimagined, redefined\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b65708eab90e24176444c5cc4501ed965d366d8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b65708eab90e24176444c5cc4501ed965d366d8c/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daughters of the Dust.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daughters of the Dust.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: null/BFI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The movie won widespread acclaim on its release, and played in one movie theatre for 36 weeks, but Dash never made another feature film. \u201cI\u2019d written many, many additional screenplays and pitched ideas and optioned screenplays \u2013 all of those wonderful things that one does after making a film that clearly had a wide audience. It didn\u2019t happen for me,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason given, but of course it\u2019s race and gender. Gender plays a huge part in all of this. I did not fit into the mould.\u201d</p> <p>As the New Yorker pointed out last year, Richard Linklater, who also released his debut, Slacker, in 1991, has gone on to make 15 features to date. \u201cSome of them are excellent,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/movie-week-daughters-dust\">wrote Richard Brody</a>, \u201cbut neither Slacker nor any of the others can hold a candle to the inventiveness of Daughters of the Dust.\u201d</p> <p>Many other black film-makers fell by the wayside after that initial burst. Wendell Harris\u2019s Sundance-winning Chameleon Street didn\u2019t get a cinema release. Matty Rich made one more movie after Straight Outta Brooklyn, then went into video games. Even those who did graduate into the mainstream found their work compromised. Charles Burnett, for example, followed up To Sleep With Anger with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Shield\">The Glass Shield</a>, a complex drama about a black cop in an institutionally racist LAPD. It was picked up by Harvey Weinstein\u2019s indie-devouring Miramax, which forced Burnett to change the ending and then attempted to market it as another Boyz N the Hood, giving prominence to Ice Cube in the promotional materials even though he was a peripheral character. It didn\u2019t find an audience, and Burnett never worked with Hollywood again.</p> <p>\u201cThat crossover into the mainstream, into an industry of big business and box office and expectations and formulas, reduced their ability to tell black-focused, \u2018authentic\u2019 stories,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/people/ashley-clark\">Ashley Clark</a>, writer and curator of the <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/black-star\">BFI\u2019s current Black Star celebration of black cinema in all its forms</a>, which includes many of those 90s classics. (It was a different story in the UK in the 1990s, incidentally. Or rather, a non-story. Just about the only British actor to figure in this era was, believe it or not, Lenny Henry. Disney gave him a three-picture deal in 1991, evidently attempting to position him as a new Eddie Murphy. They paired him with Charles Lane for True Identity, in which Henry played several roles including a white gangster. Its failure nipped both Henry\u2019s and Lane\u2019s Hollywood careers in the bud.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cce5da6af3d15eb674194c70a450fcb4540db736\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cce5da6af3d15eb674194c70a450fcb4540db736/0_0_2000_1355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delroy Lindo and Denzel Washington in Malcolm X.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delroy Lindo and Denzel Washington in Malcolm X.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Directors such as Singleton, Dickerson and Van Peebles also struggled to recapture the energy once they became Hollywood properties. Lee\u2019s career assumed the form of a continual battle. Clark points out that he had a terrible time making Malcolm X, for example. \u201cHe had to fight off competition from other studios to do it. Norman Jewison wanted to do it. His studio, Warner Bros, wouldn\u2019t expand the budget, so he had to do a crowdfunding campaign and get people like Prince, Michael Jackson and Oprah Winfrey to fund it.\u201d By the end of the decade, Lee\u2019s crossover audience had waned, even if the quality of his output hadn\u2019t. Films such as Crooklyn and Bamboozled flopped at the box office, and he wound up making journeyman genre fare such as 25th Hour.</p> <p>But what other options did Lee and co have? \u201cWhat people don\u2019t realise is, he gets tarred and feathered as this angry, political black man, but he\u2019s an artist, and he\u2019s constantly working,\u201d says Clark. \u201cHe works in documentary, he works in commercials, he never stops. And he has to do that. He can\u2019t, like other directors, just go away for eight years and come back and do something when he feels like it.\u201d</p> <p>By the new millennium, we had collectively fooled ourselves that we no longer needed a black cinema anyway. Washington and Halle Berry had won their Oscars, and nobody seemed to be that bothered that the new face of black cinema was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madea\">Tyler Perry dressed as a granny</a>. Actually, a lot of people were bothered by Perry \u2013 Lee dismissed him as \u201ccoonery buffoonery\u201d \u2013 but the assumption, particularly outside the African-American community, was that the battles had all been won. The notion was continually reinforced by self-congratulatory <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior_narrative_in_film\">white-saviour race movies</a> such as The Help, Freedom Writers, The Soloist and The Blind Side (it\u2019s still going on \u2013 see Matthew McConaughey\u2019s latest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/23/free-state-jones-review-matthew-mcconaughey-newton-knight\">The Free State of Jones</a>), or music biopics such as Ray, Dreamgirls and Get On Up, whose content was safely sealed off from the present-day black experience. Ghettoised, you could say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8bbb4e09789664d4917c6494b0c18ab61ffecd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8bbb4e09789664d4917c6494b0c18ab61ffecd1/0_0_2992_2354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sylvester Stallone and Michael B Jordan in Creed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"787\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sylvester Stallone and Michael B Jordan in Creed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>America\u2019s Obama-era post-racial vision has turned out to be an illusion. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/25/oscarssowhite-10-point-plan-hashtag-academy-awards-april-reign\">#OscarSoWhite debacle</a> highlighted ongoing discrimination and lack of opportunity within the industry. Outside of cinema, society is beginning to notice how little has changed. Boyz N the Hood began with an epigraph stating: \u201cOne out of every 21 black American males will be murdered in their lifetime.\u201d The figure is lower today, but black Americans are still eight times as likely as white ones to be homicide victims. Lee\u2019s Malcolm X began with a videotape of the brutal police beating of Rodney King, which sparked off the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In recent years, we\u2019ve seen a similar succession of police killings of unarmed African-Americans, captured on mobile phones, which have also sparked riots and civil unrest.</p> <p>A new generation of black film-makers is starting to respond to this reality, down the road those 90s pioneers paved. Witness Ryan Coogler, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/05/fruitvale-station-review-oscar-grant\">2013 Sundance-winner, Fruitvale Station</a>, sensitively dramatised the police shooting of Oscar Grant, an unarmed Oakland commuter. To his credit, Sylvester Stallone recruited Coogler to write and direct <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/14/creed-review-rocky-sequel-boxing-sylvester-stallone\">his latter-day Rocky vehicle Creed</a>, and allowed him to turn what could have been a creaky franchise instalment into a vibrant, nuanced portrait of an unstereotypical African-American (Michael B Jordan) in demographically altered modern-day Philadelphia. Coogler\u2019s next project is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/oct/29/marvel-black-panther-black-superhero-chadwick-boseman\">Marvel\u2019s Black Panther superhero movie</a>.</p> <p>Slavery has been put back on the agenda by 12 Years a Slave and Django Unchained, and it\u2019s being kept there by the Roots remake and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/oct/10/the-birth-of-a-nation-problems-nate-parker\">Nate Parker\u2019s Birth of a Nation</a> (the toast of this year\u2019s Sundance, until its maker\u2019s name was tarnished by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/30/nate-parker-birth-of-a-nation-rape-allegation-60-minutes-interview\">past rape allegations</a>). Justin Simien\u2019s Dear White People <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/25/justin-simien-im-black-im-a-man-im-gay-but-im-more-than-all-of-those-things\">smartly dissected modern campus politics</a>. Big things are anticipated for Barry Jenkins, whose artful gay black drama Moonlight comes out in the US this month. There\u2019s also (at last) an appreciable British black-cinema contingent feeding into this, both of directors (Steve McQueen, Amma Asante, Noel Clarke) and actors (David Oyelowo, Idris Elba, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Naomie Harris). Television is in good shape now, too, what with Donald Glover\u2019s Atlanta, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/12/insecure-review-issa-rae\">Issa Rae\u2019s Insecure</a>, Marvel\u2019s Luke Cage, Empire, Black-ish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3844fd6bf591a9442cbf8b8c22a2dc3ba27b91f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3844fd6bf591a9442cbf8b8c22a2dc3ba27b91f6/61_0_2834_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Straight Outta Compton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Straight Outta Compton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jaimie Trueblood/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And a force all of her own is Ava DuVernay, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/selma\">Selma</a> arguably made more of an impact for not getting enough Oscar respect than it would have done if it had. DuVernay has since turned out the powerful Netflix documentary 13th (on the incarceration of black men), the TV miniseries Queen Sugar, and her next project, Disney sci-fi A Wrinkle in Time, makes her the first black woman to command a $100m (\u00a381m) budget.</p> <p>We should be cautious before heralding a class of 2016, however, both in light of what happened last time round, but also because black cinema is a construct, just as \u201cblackness\u201d itself is a construct. The label can be limiting, says Clark. \u201cWhen a black film-maker makes films about black people, it\u2019s \u2018black cinema\u2019 rather than just cinema. You find yourself in that kind of bind, where today something like Moonlight \u2013 yes, it\u2019s being talked about in terms of black masculinity and it\u2019s very culturally specific, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s wonderful cinema. I think there\u2019s a misunderstanding that black cinema is in and of itself a genre, when in fact it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>The 90s golden age has become a cultural touchstone for the current generation. Ice Cube, for example, who has never been out of work since Boyz N the Hood, found his own life dramatised in last year\u2019s hit NWA biopic Straight Outta Compton. Cube\u2019s Boyz co-star Cuba Gooding Jr, meanwhile, just headed up another 90s-based nostalgia trip: The People Vs OJ Simpson, which won nine Emmys this year. John Singleton has just received the go-ahead for <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/john-singletons-snowfall-series-fx-1201874205/\">Snowfall, his new series on LA\u2019s 1980s crack cocaine epidemic</a> \u2013 almost a prequel to Boyz. And even Spike Lee seems to have got his mojo back. His latest, Chi-Raq, a confrontational take on south Chicago gun violence, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/25/chi-raq-review-spike-lees-urgent-angry-and-very-sexy-midlife-masterpiece\">brought him his best reviews in decades</a>, as well as reuniting him with original troupe members such as Angela Bassett, Wesley Snipes and Samuel L Jackson. Of course, he still struggled with the funding \u2013 turning to Kickstarter to finance it. But Lee also recently inked a deal with Netflix to produce and direct a comedy-drama series based on She\u2019s Gotta Have It.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e18349b881f0ee5e695284e7c27acc6457ac5d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e18349b881f0ee5e695284e7c27acc6457ac5d3/0_0_1280_722/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u2018visual album\u2019 Lemonade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u2018visual album\u2019 Lemonade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beyonce: Lemonade</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most heartening of all, perhaps, Julie Dash\u2019s Daughters of the Dust has found a new lease of life. It was selected for preservation by the Library of Congress in 2004, and a restored version is set for release in November, to mark its 25th anniversary. The film was also heavily appropriated by Beyonc\u00e9 in her lavish \u201cvisual album\u201d for Lemonade \u2013 which could turn out to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/25/beyonce-lemonade-jay-z-infidelity-emotional-project-depths\">one of the most significant pieces of black cinema of our time</a>. It\u2019s apt that a performer such as Beyonc\u00e9, in her newly politicised incarnation, would turn to a movie so concerned with cultural memory and reconnection to African-American history. That history has been reframed, redefined and reimagined once again. Dash herself is delighted. In addition, in the wake of the #OscarSoWhite debacle, Dash was one of the film-makers invited to join the new, more-inclusive Academy. Her original application, 25 years ago, was ignored. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are still a lot of people waiting at the gate, but things are moving forward.\u201d</p> <p><em>Black Star events are running nationwide until December, </em><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/black-star\"><em>bfi.org.uk/black-star</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

This is a commercial negotiation and, in the end, mutual self-interest will prevail. A deal will be done quietly. Tesco shoppers will have to pay more (but probably not 10% more) for their Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream, but supplies will be secure.</p> <p>Yet one has to admire Lewis\u2019s determination to fight to the point where stocks of Marmite and other goods are running low. It would be silly to deny Unilever\u2019s right to try to pass on some of the higher costs from commodities and dollar \u2013 and euro-denominated packaging \u2013 but an alleged 10% across-the-board price hike does indeed look too much, too soon.</p> <p>Lewis worked at Unilever for 27 years and will have a keen sense of when his former colleagues have overplayed their hand. Note how Unilever\u2019s finance director squirmed ineffectually as he refused to shed light on the 10% figure. Lewis will know that some level of price increase is inevitable, but a public row \u2013 and a little more focus on brand-owners\u2019 post-Brexit price demands \u2013 strengthens his negotiating hand. From a tactical point of view, he\u2019s played a blinder in positioning Tesco as a stout defender of UK consumers\u2019 interests.</p> <p>Yet memories are short. Lewis was hired to rescue Tesco from a crisis caused by his predecessors\u2019 willingness to bleed UK shoppers for years and years to fund their own adventures in the US, China and eastern Europe. Unlike Unilever\u2019s, Tesco\u2019s expansion wasn\u2019t merely lower-returning but a disgraceful waste of resources.</p>",
  "<p>Nigerian defence officials say they believe more schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram will be released in the coming weeks, raising the prospect of a swift end to one of the most high-profile kidnappings perpetrated by a terrorist group in recent years.</p> <p>Twenty-one of the 276 schoolgirls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/15/chibok-nigeria-200-kidnapped-schoolgirls-boko-haram\">taken from their hostel in a government boarding school in the town of Chibok</a> by the Islamic militant group in April 2014, were freed early on Thursday morning in a deal brokered by international mediators.</p> <p>The kidnapping of the girls led to the global campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/may/09/bringbackourgirls-power-of-social-media\">#BringBackOurGirls</a>, with public figures including the US first lady, Michelle Obama, taking part.</p> <p>Few details have emerged of the ordeal of the abducted girls, many of whom are believed to have been taken as wives by extremists and systematically raped. Others have reportedly been forced to carry out demanding physical tasks.</p> <p>About 190 girls from Chibok are still held by the militants.

A team of social workers, doctors and counsellors were awaiting their arrival. Many were reported to have babies with them, born in captivity. </p> <p>Earlier in the day, a spokesman for Muhammadu Buhari, the Nigerian president, confirmed that 21 of the missing girls were in the custody of the department of state services.</p> <p>\u201cThe release of the girls, in a limited number, is the outcome of negotiations between the administration and Boko Haram brokered by the International Red Cross and the Swiss government. The negotiations will continue,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe president welcomes the release of the girls but cautioned Nigerians to be mindful of the fact that more than 30,000 fellow citizens were killed via terrorism.\u201d</p> <p>The information minister, Lai Mohammed, denied reports that four Boko Haram prisoners were exchanged for the girls. \u201cThis is not a swap, but a release,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thecable.ng/breaking-fg-not-swap-boko-haram-prisoners-chibok-girls\">Mohammed said</a>.</p> <p>The release will be a boost to Buhari, who vowed to crush Boko Haram within a year when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/31/opposition-candidate-muhammadu-buhari-wins-nigerian-election\">took power in May 2015</a>. While government forces have taken back large amounts of territory from the group, it has remained active, killing hundreds of people in suicide bombings.</p> <p>The #BringBackOurGirls campaign group said Thursday\u2019s release was a \u201cwonderful development\u201d that confirmed \u201cwhat we have always known about the capacity of our government to rescue our #ChibokGirls\u201d.</p> <p>Prof Emma Shehu, a leader of the group, said she was relieved by the news.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been castigated by the past government, by the military and by the hardliners in the current administration for continuing with our advocacy and protests for the kidnapped girls. They\u2019ve treated us as though we were mad but we\u2019re happy that this is partly a vindication of our insanity. For the parents it\u2019s raised their hopes,\u201d Shehu said.</p> <p>The Chibok girls are among thousands of adults and children who have been abducted by Boko Haram during its seven-year insurgency. The group is short of manpower and has turned to abductions as recruitment has slowed.</p> <p>Negotiations with Nigerian government representatives for the release of the schoolgirls have been complicated by splits within Boko Haram. The movement has fractured into two, possibly three factions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/06/isis-al-qaida-turf-wars-africa-may-push-fragile-states-to-breaking-point\">over the issue of links with Islamic State</a>.</p> <p>Isis, of which the Nigerian group is still theoretically an affiliate, announced last month that Abu Musab al-Barnawi was the new leader of Boko Haram, replacing the erratic Abubakar Shekau. The decision may have been prompted by Shekau\u2019s use of female suicide bombers and targeting of Muslims.</p> <p>Shekau has continued to claim to be in control of the group. A video released of the Chibok girls in August seemed to have come from his camp somewhere in the sprawling Sambisa forest, in Borno. It showed about 50 of the girls and included a demand for the release of imprisoned militants in exchange for them.</p> <p>A suicide bomber in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State and birthplace of Boko Haram, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-security-idUSKCN12C0XM\">killed eight people on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p>British and US special forces have been assisting the Nigerian military in their campaign against Boko Haram. Support by soldiers from the neighbouring countries of Niger, Cameroon and Chad \u2013 was critical in pushing back the extremists, experts said.</p> <p>The previous Nigerian government, under Goodluck Jonathan, conducted high-level negotiations before realising it was talking to impostors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/muhammadu-buhari-nigeria-problems-boko-haram-corruption\">Muhammadu Buhari talked tough on Nigeria\u2019s problems.

They can only bomb locations now because they hold no territory and we are defeating them at each stage. The government is negotiating with Boko Haram, including prisoner swaps, but at the same time we the military are degrading them where we can. That is proving an effective way of defeating this group.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth Donnelly, an expert at London\u2019s Chatham House, said the release suggested \u201ca potential opening with the insurgents\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is still a question of why only this number [of girls has been released] but it shows that negotiations are possible and that is really important in trying to shift the nature of the conflict,\u201d Donnelly said.</p> <p>In the past year, the Nigerian army has retaken towns and villages in the north-east controlled by Boko Haram, and has freed hundreds of women and children held captive. However, many survivors face rejection or are stigmatised when they return to their families or are settled in refugee camps.</p> <p>In many areas of northern Nigeria, millions of victims of malnutrition, neglect and in some cases famine are surfacing, threatening a vast humanitarian crisis. Aid workers say hundreds of thousands of children are chronically malnourished.</p>",
  "<p>The owner of one of the UK\u2019s biggest restaurant groups has criticised the government\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\">hardline immigration stance</a> as \u201cretrograde\u201d and \u201cbonkers\u201d.</p> <p>David Loewi, co-owner of the group behind high-end London restaurants Le Pont de la Tour, Coq D\u2019Argent and Quaglino\u2019s, who is also chairman of the Restaurant Association trade body, said erecting barriers to the employment of workers from Europe would be \u201cextremely detrimental and would stop the growth of businesses\u201d.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Loewi said the Restaurant Association would be \u201clobbying hard\u201d against any block on employing talent from the EU and the government only had to look at the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/pound-drops-further-after-davis-hints-uk-could-leave-single-market\">fall in the value of the pound</a> in recent months to see how confidence in Britain was being affected by its stance. </p> <p>About 60% of workers at the London restaurants of Loewi\u2019s group, D&amp;D London, come from overseas, a similar proportion to other restaurant businesses in the capital. UK-wide, a fifth of workers in the accommodation and food services industries come from overseas. The majority of those workers come from the EU. </p> <p>Loewi said the anti-immigration stance taken by the government, combined with news reports of an increase in racist and xenophobic behaviour, had already made employing staff from abroad more difficult.</p> <p>\u201cThere are so many UK industries that would not be able to work without EU employees. We welcome English workers but we shouldn\u2019t be looking at where people come from if they can do a wonderful job. [Overseas workers] make London what it is and are important, certainly in the restaurant and hotel trades and the NHS,\u201d Loewi said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"723aab149e58cce24c586a64f081ff2abf7d2201\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/723aab149e58cce24c586a64f081ff2abf7d2201/428_0_5199_3121/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Des Gunewardena and David Loewi with some of the chefs who work for D&D group\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Des Gunewardena and David Loewi with some of the chefs who work for D&amp;D London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: D&amp;D London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His comments come as the government faces growing criticism over its immigration stance since the Conservative conference when the home secretary, Amber Rudd, said it was considering <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/amber-rudd-defends-proposal-to-make-firms-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers\">requiring companies to declare the proportion of international staff</a> in their workforce. Rudd later backtracked on the proposal, saying it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/amber-rudd-defends-proposal-to-make-firms-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers\">\u201cnot something we\u2019re definitely going to do\u201d</a>. <br></p> <p>At the Tory conference she also announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas\">crackdown on overseas students and work visas</a>, and pledged to prevent migrants \u201ctaking jobs British people could do\u201d.</p> <p>Loewi said Rudd\u2019s comments were \u201ccompletely bonkers, very negative and upsetting for a lot of fellow Europeans and people from all over the world who work in London and the rest of the UK. People will twice about coming here, paying their taxes.</p> <p>\u201cThe restaurant business in London pays very well and conditions are good. It\u2019s an exciting and fantastic career because you can move up and start your own business. But we can only grow and open more restaurants if we can find the staff. [Rudd\u2019s suggestions] are a retrograde and negative step.\u201d</p> <p>D&amp;D recently revealed a 3% rise in sales to \u00a3107.8m and 16% rise in underlying profits to \u00a313m. Last year it ditched plans for a London listing and saw its slowest sales growth in years as diners reined in their spending ahead of and immediately after the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Des Gunewardena, Loewi\u2019s fellow co-owner of D&amp;D, said the government needed to be \u201carmed very clearly with the positive impact of people coming from the EU on industries like ours and the NHS so they can negotiate rationally\u201d.</p> <p>He believes it is unlikely the government will ultimately block the hiring of skilled workers from the EU, although D&amp;D is already working to train more Britons to work in its kitchens and dining rooms.</p> <p>June, the month of the the EU referendum, was \u201crubbish\u201d but individuals had swiftly returned to dining out two weeks after the vote, he said.</p> <p>\u201cFor two weeks afterwards it was doom and gloom. But then the financial markets didn\u2019t collapse and everyone said: \u2018We\u2019re not going to lose our jobs tomorrow. We\u2019ve had the vote and going to Brexit, but we don\u2019t know what the shape of that is going to be for the next few years and so I\u2019m going back out to lunch and dinner.\u2019 Since then the business has been trading strongly.</p> <p>\u201cIndividual consumers are very positive. Going out to eat in a restaurant is a short-term decision not based on how things will be financially in three years\u2019 time. They are spending money and I think that\u2019s going to continue.\u201d</p> <p>D&amp;D, the vast majority of whose 34 restaurants are in London, is planning to power into the north of the UK with hopes of opening in Leeds, Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Birmingham.</p> <p>The company opened its first UK restaurants outside the capital \u2013 Angelica and Crafthouse \u2013 in the Trinity shopping centre in Leeds in 2013.</p> <p>Gunewardena said the Leeds sites had been much more successful than expected and two more restaurants would be opening in the city later this year in the Victoria Gate development. The group\u2019s first site in Manchester opens next year and it is seeking sites in other major UK cities.</p> <p> \u201cIn London there is lots of demand but lots of restaurants. There is not as much demand in Leeds or Manchester or Edinburgh but there aren\u2019t as many restaurants,\u201d Gunewardena said.</p>",
  "<p>In 2009 the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir on seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes. In 2010 it issued a further warrant on three counts of genocide. He is the only sitting head of state charged with committing genocide against his own people. In a majority Arab country, the ethnically African groups, especially those around the Darfur area, have long been politically marginalised. But since 2003 Bashir has been trying to systematically eliminate them, not least through his proxies, the hated Janjaweed (literally \u201cdevils on horseback\u201d) militia, notorious for their cruelty. To take one example out of many: in February 2004, the Janjaweed attacked a boarding school in Darfur, forcing 110 girls to strip at gunpoint before raping many of them and burning down their school. Little wonder tens of thousands have been fleeing for their lives.</p> <p>And it gets worse. Last month, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/09/chemical-weapons-attacks-darfur/\" title=\"\">Amnesty International released a report</a> with evidence that, earlier this year, Bashir\u2019s air force had been dropping chemical weapons on some of the remoter villages. It is hard to get the soil samples that would fully evidence such a claim \u2013 foreigners, even UN-African Union peacekeepers \u2013 are not allowed in the region. But the horrific photographs of children with blistered skin and bleeding eyes look very much like the effects of some version of mustard gas. No, it\u2019s not a competition, but as the world is rightly concerned with the plight of the people of Aleppo, there are others \u2013 in perhaps more out of the way places \u2013 who get far less of our attention.</p> <p>But why has the UK government given no official statement on the evidence of chemical weapons use? Could it be that it wants to play down the significance of these attacks because the Bashir regime has now become an EU partner in the management of African immigration to Europe?</p> <p>Last November, at a meeting in Malta, the EU came up with <a href=\"http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/international-summit/2015/11/11-12/\" title=\"\">the Khartoum process</a>. Desperate to respond to the migration \u201ccrisis\u201d, it signed an agreement for \u201cenhanced cooperation on migration and mobility\u201d, giving Sudan \u20ac100m over&#xa0;three years, with another \u20ac46m specifically allocated for border control, training border police and establishing holding centres. And it\u2019s often the Janjaweed that do the job of policing borders.</p> <p>Outrageous doesn\u2019t begin to cover it. Sudanese government officials are in London again this week for more \u201cstrategic dialogue\u201d on migration cooperation. It seems that, because European electorates are getting increasingly anxious about immigration, we are now prepared to make a deal with the devil, funding to the tune of many millions a man who would be arrested for genocide were he to step foot on our shores. And why? Because Bashir has promised to help the EU stop people fleeing to Europe at source. The fact that they are fleeing his death squads and chemical weapons attacks isn\u2019t being mentioned. We play down the genocide against his own people because he is now a valued \u201cpartner\u201d on immigration and at the centre of one of the established migration routes from the Horn of Africa.</p> <p>Not everyone is fleeing from Bashir\u2019s bombs. In South Sudan, for instance, a&#xa0;civil war has left tens of thousands on the very edge of starvation, living off goat bones and water lilies. In the capital, Juba, traders are now cutting their tomatoes in half because people can\u2019t afford to buy a whole one. To&#xa0;dismiss those who flee such horrors as mere \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d, as if all they want is some gilded consumer lifestyle of TVs and PlayStations, is wilfully blind and manifestly cruel.</p> <p>And, by the way, let\u2019s not blame any of this on Brexit. The shoddy Khartoum deal was an EU deal. And it took place over six months before we voted on EU membership. <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/eu-to-work-with-despot-in-sudan-to-keep-refugees-out-a-1092328.html\" title=\"\">Der Spiegel reported</a> that the 28 EU states had agreed to secrecy about the deal. \u201cUnder no circumstances\u201d should the public find out what was going on, the EU commission warned. Maybe that\u2019s why we are not hearing so much about Bashir dropping chemical weapons on his own people. Freaked by immigration, the EU is now prepared to do business with murderers.</p>",
  "<p>Hundreds of people have been wrongly refused bank accounts or had their driving licences revoked under the former home secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/10/immigration-bill-theresa-may-hostile-environment\">Theresa May\u2019s measures to \u201ccreate a hostile environment for illegal immigrants\u201d</a>, the immigration watchdog has revealed.</p> <p>David Bolt, the chief inspector of borders and immigration, said the Home Office had failed to appreciate the potential impact of such wrong decisions on those affected. </p> <p>His <a href=\"http://icinspector.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Hostile-environment-driving-licences-and-bank-accounts-January-to-July-2016.pdf\">report, published on Thursday</a>, shows that more than 250 people who had their driving licences revoked last year had been wrongfully identified as being in the UK illegally, as had 10% of those denied a bank or building society account.</p> <p>The chief inspector\u2019s first assessment of the initial 2014 phase of May\u2019s \u201chostile environment measures\u201d to deny public and private services to people with no legal right to be in the UK raises questions about whether ministers were justified in pressing ahead with phase two, due to come into effect next year. </p> <p>The second phase will create a new offence of driving unlawfully in Britain, and banks and building societies will be empowered to close the accounts of immigrants who are in the country illegally and freeze their assets.</p> <p>Bolt said there was insufficient hard evidence to determine whether the measures were achieving what the government intended, such as an increase in those voluntarily returning home. A proper evaluation was needed, he said, not least because of concerns about the potential damage of the measures to individuals and communities.</p> <p>In a separate report commissioned by May in January when she was home secretary, the chief inspector revealed that almost 200,000 foreign nationals had been arrested in 2014-15 in England and Wales. But the police asked the Home Office to carry out immigration status checks on only 30% of the foreign nationals arrested outside London. When the Metropolitan police force was included, the proportion whose immigration status was checked rose to just over 50%.</p> <p>The \u201chostile measures\u201d report reveals that 9,732 people had their driving licences revoked in 2015 after Home Office checks on their immigration status \u2013 close to the 10,000 a year target set by ministers. In total, 20,000 people have had their driving licences revoked since the measure was introduced in July 2014. </p> <p>Bolt said, however, that human error and poor quality Home Office data led to 259 people who were not in the country illegally having their driving licences revoked in 2015, and the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency had to reinstate them.</p> <p>\u201cWhile these cases amounted to a small percentage of the total numbers of revocations, the Home Office did not appear to appreciate the seriousness of such errors for the individuals affected,\u201d said the chief inspector.</p> <p>\u201cThis was particularly true where a licence had been revoked when the individual had departed the UK before their leave had expired.\u201d In such cases, if the person returned without knowing their licence had been revoked they faced being disqualified if they drove on British roads.</p> <p>He said only 583 of the 9,732 people who had their licences revoked in 2015 subsequently left the country. On top of that, only 475 revoked licences were actually returned to the DVLA in 2014-15.</p> <p>Bolt said it was not possible to say how many people were refused a bank or building society account on the grounds of being in the country illegally because the 2014 law does not require them to report customer refusals from immigration status checks.<br></p> <p>But, he said, a sample of 169 case files of those refused accounts showed that 17 (10%) should not have been listed as \u201cdisqualified persons\u201d on immigration grounds, despite the list being updated weekly.</p> <p> A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cAs the home secretary announced earlier this month, we will be introducing measures that will mean that banks will have to do regular checks to ensure that they are not providing banking services to illegal migrants. Furthermore, we are introducing a new power to search for and seize UK driving licences held by those living in the UK unlawfully. </p> <p> \u201cThe measures discussed in the independent chief inspector\u2019s report should not be seen in isolation, but as part of the wider action we are taking that has made it harder than ever before for illegal migrants to live in this country.\u201d</p>",

I still find it hard to believe to this day that the UK is heading out of the EU,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Like Michelle Heming, Smith has concerns about both work trips and family holidays, and the possibility of being separated from his wife and children at airports. </p> \n<p>Smith, who comes from Derbyshire, feared Brexit would make it more complicated for those like him still having to travel on a UK passport. </p> \n<p>\u201cWith an Irish passport I can travel freely on business anywhere around Europe. I am one of the unlucky ones as my ancestors emigrated in the 19th century to Australia and eventually returned to Britain. They were originally from Ireland but their roots are too far back for me to claim automatic citizenship. So there is only one route I have to take and that is to apply to become an Irish citizen.\u201d</p> \n<p>The process is not quick.

(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/13/boris-johnson-brexit-foreign-affairs-committee-quizzed-by-mps-over-brexit-as-pound-falls-again-politics-live?page=with:block-57ff6255e4b01ffb8ffcb3da#block-57ff6255e4b01ffb8ffcb3da\"> 11.33am.) </a>In some respects, this sounded more like a negotiating gambit than a statement of intent. As my colleague <strong>Severin Carrell </strong>points out (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/13/boris-johnson-brexit-foreign-affairs-committee-quizzed-by-mps-over-brexit-as-pound-falls-again-politics-live?page=with:block-57ff6ae1e4b047a4eaafc0e3#block-57ff6ae1e4b047a4eaafc0e3\">12.12pm), </a>there are still considerable obstacles to winning a second independence referendum. Sturgeon does not have the power to call a legally-binding independence referendum, and Theresa May has hinted that, unlike David Cameron in 2014,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-57f11d1ce4b015be63833667#block-57f11d1ce4b015be63833667\"> she would not facilitate such a poll. </a>Sturgeon also seems to be ignoring the promise she made last year, which was that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/oct/15/snp-conference-politics-live?page=with:block-561f77d9e4b0a565784b9ab1#block-561f77d9e4b0a565784b9ab1\">she would not call a second independence referendum unless there was \u201cstrong evidence that a significant number of those who voted No have changed their minds\u201d. </a>At the moment that evidence does not exist.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She made remaining in the single market Scotland\u2019s key priority.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister may have a mandate to take England and Wales out of the EU but she has no mandate whatsoever to remove any part of the UK from the single market.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she wanted Scotland to acquire extensive new powers.</strong> She explained that she would be developing a Brexit plan for Scotland and that, if Scotland were not to become independent, it needed to acquire new powers to ensure that it did not lose out from Brexit.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Scottish government will set out a plan for Scotland.</p> <p>We will seek to make this plan a key element of the UK\u2019s Article 50 negotiation.</p> <p>It will require substantial additional powers for the Scottish Parliament.</p> <p>All the powers in our areas of responsibility that currently lie with the EU - and significant new powers too.</p> <p>Powers to strike international deals.</p> <p>And greater powers over immigration. Powers not just to protect our economy, but also our values.</p> <p>UK ministers might believe it acceptable to order businesses to create lists of foreign workers.</p> <p>We do not.</p> </blockquote> <p>This passage suggests that, as an alternative to a second independence referendum, Sturgeon is demanding a new version of independence-lite.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She said a second independence referendum would not be a re-run of the last one.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is one final point I want to make. And it\u2019s an important one.</p> <p>When Scotland does come to take this decision again - whenever that might be - we must not take for granted how anyone will vote.<br></p> <p>It will be a new debate - not a rerun of 2014.</p> <p>We must not assume that people\u2019s views - yes or no - are the same today as they were two years ago.</p> <p>Instead we must engage the arguments with a fresh eye and an open mind.</p> <p>The case for independence will have to be made and won.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the SNP would vote against the proposed \u201cgreat repeal bill\u201d - the bill planned for the next session of parliament to repeal the European Communities Act 1972.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can confirm today that SNP MPs will vote against the Brexit bill when it come before the House of Commons next year.</p> <p>That Bill will repeal the legislation that enacted our EU membership. Scotland didn\u2019t vote for that and so neither will our MPs.</p> <p>But we will also work to persuade others - Labour, Liberals and moderate Tories - to join us in a coalition against a hard Brexit: not just for Scotland, but for the whole UK.</p> <p>In practice this is unlikely to make much difference because Labour is unlikely to vote against the bill at second reading. Many Labour MPs are opposed to a \u201chard\u201d Brexit, but most of them do not intend to right against the principle of the UK leaving the EU.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the Conservatives were pushing for a hard Brexit for which they had no mandate.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They are using the [referendum] result as cover for a hard Brexit for which they have no mandate - but which they are determined to impose, regardless of the ruinous consequences.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She accused the Conservatives of embracing Ukip-style xenophobia and said their views had \u201cno place in a civilised society\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Last week, in Birmingham, we heard an intolerance towards those from other countries that has no place in a modern, multicultural, civilised society.</p> <p>You know, on the day of the prime minister\u2019s speech to the Tory conference, the new leader of UKIP resigned.</p> <p>Perhaps she realized that her job and her party are now redundant.</p> <p>Last week, we saw the Tories adopt UKIP policy and Farage-style rhetoric - lock, stock and beer-barrel.</p> <p>It was a disgrace. It shames the Tory party and all who speak for it.</p> <p>But make no mistake - the right wing of the Tory party is now in the ascendancy and it is seeking to hijack the referendum result.</p> <p>Brexit has become Tory Brexit.</p> <p>The rampant right wing of the party are using it as license for the xenophobia that has long lain under the surface - but which is now in full, unlovely view.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She compared Theresa May to Margaret Thatcher. </strong>This was noteworthy because of Thatcher\u2019s continuing unpopularity in Scotland.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Sturgeon said that even though 1m Scots voted for Brexit, they did not vote for the hard Brexit now on offer from the Tories.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course, I know that one million of our fellow citizens voted to Leave. They did so for a range of legitimate reasons and as first minister, I have a duty to listen to, to understand and to respond to these reasons.</p> <p>But I suspect that many of those who voted to Leave, look now at the actions and rhetoric of the Tories and think \u2018that\u2019s not what I voted for\u2019.</p> <p>They may have voted to take back control.</p> <p>But I can\u2019t imagine many of them voted to hand control to the unholy trinity of Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox ...</p> <p>They didn\u2019t vote to throw economic rationality out of the window.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t vote to lower their own living standards or to sacrifice jobs and investment.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t vote for our businesses to face tariffs or for holiday-makers to need visas.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t vote for the scapegoating of foreigners.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sturgeon\u2019s language at this point in the speech is similar to what has been said by Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who has also been arguing that the referendum vote was not a vote for \u201chard\u201d Brexit.

Here is an extract from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a4e6bd4-84ae-11e6-8897-2359a58ac7a5\">a withering column about him that <strong>Philip Stephens </strong>published in the Financial Times (subscription) recently.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Word in Westminster has it that Boris Johnson would like to apologise personally to Barack Obama for raising his \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d ancestry when the US president backed the pro-Europeans during the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Brexit\">EU referendum</a>. Word in Washington is that the UK foreign secretary would do as well not to bother. Such slights are not easily forgotten by the first African-American president.</p> <p>Mr Johnson seems to have something of a problem with, well, foreigners. Fellow Europeans have not forgiven the mendacity of the EU \u201cout\u201d campaign. Some in Africa may recall his allusions, albeit some while ago, to \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d and \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d. He says such remarks have been taken out of context. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e356f76-84bd-11e6-a29c-6e7d9515ad15\">Visiting Ankara this week</a> he presumably told his hosts something similar about the Leave campaign\u2019s scaremongering about Turkish migrants.</p> <p>Foreign policy is a serious business, the more so in an age of global upheaval and rising disorder. Mr Johnson looks more comfortable in the role of court jester than thoughtful policymaker. He prefers the broad brush to irksome detail. His Italian opposite number Paolo Gentiloni was left baffled when Mr Johnson proposed a post-Brexit grand bargain: Italy would back open access to the EU for London\u2019s financial industry and Britain would continue to drink lots of Italian prosecco.</p> <p>Word in Berlin is that Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the intensely serious German foreign minister, can scarcely abide being in the same room as Mr Johnson. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b1a3c3e-81b7-11e6-8e50-8ec15fb462f4\">Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble</a>, Germany\u2019s finance minister, has mocked the foreign secretary\u2019s shallow grasp of the way the union works by offering to send him the Lisbon treaty. Finance ministers, he remarked waspishly, were \u201caccustomed to having a high degree of respect for foreign ministers\u201d. It might be added that Theresa May, the prime minister, is banking on Berlin\u2019s support to secure a good deal in the Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>Allies say that Mr Johnson is \u201ca quick read\u201d \u2014 when paying attention, he absorbs information easily. Whitehall no doubt has laid on crash seminars on the workings of the world. The foreign secretary does not help himself, though, by addressing fellow ministers in the manner of Bertie Wooster, the twittish toff from the pages of English humorist PG Wodehouse. The other day Mr Johnson sat down with the hard-bitten Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. An unkind observer might have imagined Wodehouse\u2019s Wooster meeting Machiavelli\u2019s Prince.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ff3822e4b01d9dd2c9074f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T08:03:14.594Z\">9.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Who\u2019d have guessed that Brexit would trigger a national Marmite shortage?

We don\u2019t think that, as a country, we can afford to let so much talent and ambition go to waste.\u201d</p> <p>The issue was at the centre of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/21/supreme-court-challenge-student-loan-rules-immigrants\">supreme court hearing</a> last year which resulted in new guidelines, but campaigners say many young people from a migrant background are still missing out. To qualify for a government loan, students from migrant backgrounds must be able to prove that they have lived in the UK for at least half their life and that they have had \u201clawful ordinary residence\u201d for a minimum of three years. </p> <p>The only way to become \u201clawfully ordinarily resident\u201d is by being granted limited or indefinite leave to remain by the Home Office, which can be a long and complicated process. After that, they face a three-year wait before being eligible for a student loan and before automatically qualifying for home student fees. Many young people from migrant backgrounds and their families do not realise until it is too late.</p> <p>King\u2019s College London has already established two <a href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/fees-and-funding/student-funding/scholarships-and-bursaries/scholarships/sanctuary-scholarship.aspx\">sanctuary scholarships </a>offering full tuition fee support and help with living costs to assist students who have sought sanctuary in the UK. Arkam Babar, 20, who has born in Pakistan, has just started a geography degree thanks to the scholarship and is hoping other universities will make similar funding available to others.</p> <p> \u201cBefore I was awarded the scholarship by King\u2019s College London, I had little hope of being able to study, which was devastating as my family has always placed a strong emphasis on education,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe King\u2019s scholarship has transformed my situation.

They can only bomb locations now because they hold no territory and we are defeating them at each stage.

She went on strike even though she was not part of a labor union.</p> <p> When Flores, a mother of five, walked out in February 2013, she was one of just eight janitors from stores in the Twin Cities to go on strike that day to demand better conditions.

On Thursday, they will announce that 600 janitors have won union recognition and will soon start collective bargaining in the hope of winning higher pay, health coverage and other improvements. </p> <p> \u201cI could have done nothing, but I chose to fight,\u201d Flores said. \u201cThis has been a long fight, but now I feel overjoyed. All the hard work has paid off.\u201d </p> <p> Flores hopes that her new union, Local 26 of the Service Employees International Union, will bring important gains when it bargains with the retailers\u2019 cleaning contractors. \u201cWe want fair work scheduling, health insurance, higher wages,\u201d Flores said in Spanish. \u201cAll these things would allow me to be more involved in the daily lives of my children and to have a better quality of life.\u201d</p> <p> This fight began seven years ago when an immigrant workers\u2019 center in Minneapolis \u2013 Centro Trabajadores Unidos en Lucha (United Workers Center in Struggle) \u2013 contacted janitors at retail stores in the Twin Cities area. That workers\u2019 center, known as CTUL, formed an organizing committee, led a three-mile protest march, held a 12-day hunger strike and sponsored a series of steadily expanding one-day strikes, which aimed to pressure retail powerhouses such as Target and Best Buy, both based in the Twin Cities, to give the janitors a voice at work.</p> <p> The effort grew more ambitious, with its focus turning towards getting Target to adopt a Responsible Contractor Policy. Target adopted such a policy in 2014, requiring its contractors to comply with labor and wage laws, and the janitors\u2019 focus then changed to forming a labor union, convinced that this was the best way to win better conditions. </p> <p>Labor experts say this is probably the most successful effort to unionize retail store janitors in the US. \u201cThe retail janitorial industry has been overwhelmingly non-union \u2013 it was viewed by most people as \u2018unorganizable\u2019,\u201d said Stephen Lerner, the former head of the SEIU\u2019s Justice for Janitors Campaign, which unionized tens of thousands of office building janitors nationwide.</p> <p>Javier Morillo, the president of Local 26, noted a disconnect in the way Target\u2019s janitors are treated. A unionized janitor \u201cwho cleans Target\u2019s corporate headquarters makes over $15 an hour and has health benefits\u201d, he said. \u201cBut if you clean inside a store, you make close to the minimum wage and have no health coverage or other benefits. It\u2019s strange. It\u2019s the same work.\u201d</p> <p>The campaign faced some major hurdles, among them that few janitors spoke English; that they were from many countries, from El Salvador to Somalia; and that many were undocumented. Veronica Mendez Moore, CTUL\u2019s co-director, said the effort faced two other big obstacles: employee isolation and the complex structure of the industry.<strong><br></strong></p> <p>Her group sought to contact janitors at 300 stores in the Twin Cities area, with many stores having just one or two janitors, who often worked after midnight. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated industry structure with all these retailers and contractors so it was hard to figure out strategy,\u201d Mendez said. \u201cAnd these workers felt very isolated. It\u2019s hard for them to feel there are other workers standing up with them. We did a lot of work to find ways to connect workers.\u201d Organizers arranged conference calls that connected dozens of janitors, who for the first time could hear other janitors speaking out. Often, individual organizers drove to stores after midnight and used their mobile phones to connect one or two janitors to a conference call.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem revolutionary, but workers haven\u2019t done anything like this,\u201d Mendez said. \u201cIt was very intense to connect workers this way. They\u2019re scattered all over the suburbs.\u201d</p> <p>The increasingly connected janitors grew more emboldened, holding several protests outside Target stores in Minneapolis. For Target these strikes became a headache. After the second strike, Target executives sat down with several CTUL leaders and janitors. Ultimately Target agreed to a Responsible Contractor Policy, which requires contractors not to break the law in fighting against unionization. The janitors also protested at a Best Buy shareholders meeting, helping to persuade that company to hire a new cleaning contractor that CTUL viewed as \u201cresponsible\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese strikes really helped, they really pressured the companies to do the right thing,\u201d said Pascual Tapia, a janitor at a Target in downtown Minneapolis. He told of a cleaning contractor who cheated him and his coworkers out of overtime by forcing them \u2013 when working more than 40 hours a week \u2013 to punch in under the name of a \u201cghost\u201d employee.</p> <p> CTUL and the janitors brought several lawsuits against such wage theft, winning settlements that totaled more than $1m in back pay and damages. As a result of the campaign, the area\u2019s retailers jettisoned some law-breaking contractors and hired better ones to replace them, helping to shrink the number of major contractors to four, from 20. </p> <p> The janitors are winning recognition from three cleaning contractors: IFS, Carlson Building Maintenance and Prestige Maintenance. The companies agreed to begin bargaining under a trigger mechanism \u2013 only once the janitors gained recognition from contractors that clean 60% of the area\u2019s roughly 300 big box stores.

Morillo, Local 26\u2019s president, noted that some labor leaders criticize worker centers for doing little to unionize workers.</p> <p> \u201cThe importance of this is that five years ago, this market looked unorganizable, in the way that many low-wage and contingent workers seem unorganizable for traditional collective bargaining,\u201d Morillo said. \u201cThat\u2019s the big innovation here.\u201d </p> <p> Mendez said worker centers in other cities have called CTUL for advice on how they, too, can mobilize and organize retail janitors. </p> <p> \u201cA lot has changed for us,\u201d said Maricela Flores, the janitor. \u201cThat first day I went on strike I was very afraid, afraid of getting fired.

It was used in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/mar/26/erol-incedal-case-secret-trial-terror\">Erol Incedal trial last year</a>.</p> <p>The legal means used to try to secure a conviction are now provoking concern about a lack of open justice and the way in which the media are restricted in reporting terrorism trials.</p> <p>In a judgment on whether the case could be heard in secret, which can now be reported, the judge, Richard Marks QC, said he considered the general problem in such cases. \u201cThe knowledge that having cooperated with a state agency, a witness from that agency had given chapter and verse in open court about the dealings they had had, would, in my judgment, be highly likely to act as a serious disincentive to others who might otherwise be contemplating rendering assistance.\u201d</p> <p>Abdalla hung his head as the jury found him guilty by a majority of 11 to one after deliberating for 19 hours and 30 minutes. He was remanded in custody to be sentenced at a later date. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>As he was being remanded Abdalla threw a plastic cup at a counter-terrorism officer and said: \u201cOne day we will be standing in a bigger court than this.\u201d </p> <p>Abdalla, 26, was born in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, in February 1989. He eventually settled in Birmingham, was granted leave to remain in the UK in 2011 and became a British passport holder but his academic career floundered.</p> <p>At Wolverhampton University, he failed five out of seven modules on an IT course and did not submit written assessments the following year. He was asked to leave in 2010. Short-term jobs followed.</p> <p>He came to the attention of the police when he was stopped carrying a computer belonging to Ahmed Diini, who was later imprisoned in Egypt. The court heard that Abdalla was repeatedly detained at airports and ferry terminals under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, known as a \u201cport stop\u201d; often he was questioned for so long that he missed his flight or ferry.</p> <p>Details of his interviews were passed to MI5. On one occasion Abdalla told officers: \u201cI wish I was in Somalia: better to be killed and know your enemy.\u201d</p> <p>Abdalla came to believe that interference from the security services meant his girlfriend left him, his bank card stopped working and he lost jobs, the court was told. His barrister, Rajiv Menon QC, told the jury: \u201cThis is the stuff of nightmares from which there is no escape. This is what happens when you are targeted by the security services and decline to cooperate.\u201d</p> <p>Abdalla denied the charge of preparing acts of terrorism. His lawyer said he had been planning to slip unnoticed out of the UK and move to Bulgaria, where his cousin was studying. <br></p> <p>He falsified his qualifications in some job applications, Menon said, because he was desperate to work. He had participated in a fraudulent cheque scheme, it was said, in order to raise money to leave the country. A bank spotted that the cheques had been altered. Abdalla, who had fled, was arrested in Germany, returned to the UK on a European extradition warrant, jailed for breaching his bail and convicted of fraud.</p> <p>After being released, he was called into Stechford police station in Birmingham so that his confiscated laptop could be returned in February 2013. It was a set-up, Abdalla said. Counter-terrorism officers escorted him upstairs to a green-carpeted room with cameras and recording devices on the wall.</p> <p>Two men were inside, Abdalla told the court. One, who gave his name as \u201cPhil\u201d, stood up, shook his hand, praised his skills and asked if he would like to work for the security services \u201cgathering intelligence on targets\u201d.</p> <p>Abdalla said he told them he did not want to work for MI5 \u201cunless they could convince me it was a noble cause\u201d. Their debate allegedly degenerated into a row over rendition, kidnap and torture.</p> <p>Phil, Abdalla said, \u201cacknowledged they did certain things wrong \u2026 and made mistakes \u2026 but that that did not mean everything [MI5] did was wrong \u2026 At times he would be very angry. He said: \u2018It\u2019s in your best interest to work for us.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Three days after leaving the station, Abdalla said, Phil called him hoping to arrange another meeting. Abdalla said he rejected the offer and hung up. Over the following 18 months, he claimed, he received hundreds more telephone calls from the same number; sometimes five or 10 calls a day. Abdalla normally ignored them. Once, he said, he answered and a woman said: \u201cPhil wants to speak to you.\u201d Abdalla turned the phone off. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>During an open session, the prosecution, led by Duncan Atkinson QC, challenged Abdalla\u2019s claim that he was fleeing from security force harassment and attempted to demonstrate that the difficulties in his life were due to other causes. The court was told that the defendant developed his reason for leaving the country long after his arrest.</p> <p>By 2015, Abdalla, who lived in Acocks Green, Birmingham, was one of the targets being investigated by an undercover officer, codename \u201cMuhamed\u201d, who had infiltrated alleged Isis supporters suspected of planning to smuggle themselves out of the UK to Syria, the court heard.</p> <p>One of the other men, Gabriel Rasmus, 29, from Lozells, Birmingham, has pleaded guilty to preparing acts of terrorism, the same offence under section 5(1) of the Terrorism Act 2006 with which Abdalla is charged.</p> <p>Abdalla and Rasmus, the prosecutor alleged, were planning to travel to Syria via Bulgaria and Turkey \u201cto join forces with so-called Islamic State and to offer their services, with their lives if necessary, to engage in acts of terrorism\u201d.</p> <p>His final, chaotic search for a lorry to smuggle him overseas was tracked by counter-terrorism officers. When he was detained at Dover, Abdalla held a valid UK passport and, like Rasmus, carried a rucksack containing an iPhone wrapped in foil, a second Nokia mobile, ID cards, \u00a3520 and \u20ac250 in cash, waterproof clothing, walking boots and a G-Shock watch. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>One of the other men detained from the lorry was Mahamuud Diini, Ahmed\u2019s brother. The court was told he had also been trying to leave the country covertly. Diini, however, had been prosecuted previously for seeking to travel to Syria but was acquitted.</p> <p>Menon pointed out that Abdalla had also been carrying a blazer. \u201cWhy take a blazer,\u201d he asked, \u201cif you are heading for the frontline?\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

I am now married, and with my second child my situation was very different and I was able to take 10 months off.</p> <p>I have regrets about having only three months off with my first child. I missed out on so much. For example, my son\u2019s first steps, the first time he rolled over on his own \u2013 there were lots of firsts I missed because I was at work. I also missed out on the friendships that new mums make when they take their children to baby and toddler activities. I didn\u2019t do any of that because I went out to work. I was a very lonely working single mum, and when my son started school we didn\u2019t have any of those important networks or friendships.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think there should be any hard and fast rules about maternity leave. I don\u2019t judge anyone on the basis of the amount of time they take, it is entirely up to them. I felt judged and guilty when I went to work when my son was only three months old, but I just did what was right for me at the time.</p> <h2>Meerat Kaur, 35, from London: \u2018I rushed back to work as parenthood was affecting my mental health\u2019</h2> <p>I was meant to take the full year off when my daughter was born. However, I rushed back to work after eight months because I found raising a baby incredibly difficult and it started affecting my mental health. I went from doing a job that I was great at to spending 24/7 looking after a baby and not really knowing what I was doing, feeling constantly stressed by everything. I felt a bit adrift and didn\u2019t know what to do when my baby wouldn\u2019t stop crying, for example. It was overwhelming and everyone was offering different advice on how to look after her.</p> <p>I tend to always know what I am doing, or can at least figure it out, so I found my new role as mother difficult. Even with a good and happy baby, albeit one that didn\u2019t sleep much, I struggled. I am not naturally good with babies (which I didn\u2019t realise until I had one). I felt, at times, like I was drowning on maternity leave, rather than staying afloat. I also found every day quite monotonous and there was no break. Even when you\u2019re ill you cannot really take a day off as a mum.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I felt like I was drowning on maternity leave rather than staying afloat</p> <footer> <cite>Meerat Kaur</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This all led to me feeling low, and it was a feeling that wouldn\u2019t go away. I was struggling and I missed my job. I\u2019ve always been used to having space to myself, which I didn\u2019t realise was a coping mechanism for any stress I was facing. Suddenly I didn\u2019t have that, and felt overwhelmed. Some mothers find looking after their children hard, but it\u2019s not always openly talked about.<br></p> <p>As a mother, society tends to expect me to stay at home with my child. The system was designed for that to happen, with me getting the statutory time off work. However, my husband would have been a much better carer for the baby than me. He is just much better with young children; patient, caring and understanding. He knows what to do when they won\u2019t stop crying and is, ironically, much more maternal than me. <br></p> <p>I am now much better with our girl as she turns six. We do lots of stuff together these days, such as going kayaking and having discussions about the state of the world. It would have been good to be able to sit down and talk about who looks after the children, based on who has the skills and desire to do so. This is more likely to happen due to the new rights introduced last year which allow <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32130481\">parents to share 50 weeks of leave between them \u2013 37 of those weeks paid</a>.

This meant that I was back at work barely a week into being a new father, and it wasn\u2019t long enough to adapt. I didn\u2019t know what to expect with a new baby, but at the time it was a bit of a shock that this tiny creature needed almost 24-hour care. Going into work after a week of no sleep and trying to concentrate on anything more than making a cup of tea was hard.</p> <p>The second time round, I booked a month off. I also booked six weeks of Fridays off. I\u2019m lucky to have an understanding employer. The time I got to spend with my youngest was precious. On Fridays I could take the baby to the park and sit on the grass with him. We would then collect my older son from school and take him for ice-cream. It gave my wife a few hours out. Sometimes he\u2019d sleep and I\u2019d read the paper and have a coffee \u2013 a rare treat. I\u2019d definitely recommend it to new dads.</p> <p>A month off was ideal. After that, I needed to get back to work, but it\u2019s different for everyone. Parents and employers need to be prepared to have a conversation about what works for both parties. It doesn\u2019t need to be off or not \u2013 a phased return, more working from home and reduced hours can all help make the transition run smoothly. .</p> <h2>Anonymous, 39, from Kent: \u2018It\u2019s not realistic to expect lots of time off\u2019</h2> <p>Two weeks is enough for the parent who is going back to work. It\u2019s necessary to be there, but the immediate melee has largely subsided by then. A month would be lovely, but someone has to pay for it.

  "<p>Last March, my 71-year-old grandmother, Betty, waited in line for three hours to caucus for Bernie Sanders. The wait to be able to cast her first-ever vote in a primary election was punishing, but nothing could have deterred her. Betty \u2013 a white woman who left school after ninth grade, had her first child at age 16 and spent much of her life in severe poverty \u2013 wanted to vote.</p> <p>So she waited with busted knees that once stood on factory lines. She waited with smoking-induced emphysema and the false teeth she\u2019s had since her late 20s \u2013 both markers of our class. She waited with a womb that in the 1960s, before Roe v Wade, she paid a stranger to thrust a wire hanger inside after she discovered she was pregnant by a man she\u2019d fled after he broke her jaw.</p> <p>Betty worked for many years as a probation officer for the state judicial system in Wichita, Kansas, keeping tabs on men who had murdered and raped. As a result, it\u2019s hard to faze her, but she has pronounced Republican candidate Donald Trump a sociopath \u201cwhose mouth overloads his ass\u201d.</p> <p>No one loathes Trump \u2013 who suggested women should be <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/us/politics/donald-trump-abortion.html\">punished</a> for having abortions, who said hateful things about groups of people she has loved and worked alongside since childhood, whose pomp and indecency offends her modest, midwestern sensibility \u2013 more than she.</p> <p>Yet, it is white working-class people like Betty who have become a particular fixation among the chattering class during this election: what is this angry beast, and why does it support Trump?<br></p> <h2>Not so poor: Trump voters are middle class</h2> <p>Hard numbers complicate, if not roundly dismiss, the oft-regurgitated theory that income or education levels predict Trump support, or that working-class whites support him disproportionately. Last month, <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2822059\">results of 87,000 interviews </a>conducted by Gallup showed that those who liked Trump were under no more economic distress or immigration-related anxiety than those who opposed him.</p> <p>According to the study, his supporters didn\u2019t have lower incomes or higher unemployment levels than other Americans. Income data misses a lot; those with healthy earnings might also have negative wealth or downward mobility. But respondents overall weren\u2019t clinging to jobs perceived to be endangered. \u201cSurprisingly\u201d, a Gallup researcher wrote, \u201cthere appears to be no link whatsoever between exposure to trade competition and support for nationalist policies in America, as embodied by the Trump campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, primary exit polls revealed that Trump voters were, in fact, more affluent than most Americans, with a <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/\">median household income of $72,000</a> \u2013 higher than that of Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders supporters. Forty-four percent of them had college degrees, well above the national average of 33% among whites or 29% overall. In January, political scientist Matthew MacWilliams <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/01/donald-trump-2016-authoritarian-213533\">reported</a> findings that a penchant for authoritarianism \u2013 not income, education, gender, age or race \u2013predicted Trump support.</p> <p>These facts haven\u2019t stopped pundits and journalists from pushing story after story about the white working class\u2019s giddy embrace of a bloviating demagogue.</p> <p>In seeking to explain Trump\u2019s appeal, proportionate media coverage would require more stories about the racism and misogyny among white Trump supporters in tony suburbs. Or, if we\u2019re examining economically driven bitterness among the working class, stories about the Democratic lawmakers who in recent decades ended welfare as we knew it, hopped in the sack with Wall Street and forgot American labor in their global trade agreements.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t need their analysis, and we sure don\u2019t need their tears. What we need is to have our stories told</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But, for national media outlets comprised largely of middle- and upper-class liberals, that would mean looking their own class in the face.</p> <p>The faces journalists do train the cameras on \u2013 hateful ones screaming sexist vitriol next to Confederate flags \u2013 must receive coverage but do not speak for the communities I know well. That the media industry ignored my home for so long left a vacuum of understanding in which the first glimpse of an economically downtrodden white is presumed to represent the whole.</p> <p>Part of the current glimpse is JD Vance, author of the bestselling new memoir <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-lives-of-poor-white-people\">Hillbilly Elegy</a>. A successful attorney who had a precariously middle-class upbringing in an Ohio steel town, Vance wrote of the chaos that can haunt a family with generational memory of deep poverty. A conservative who says he won\u2019t vote for Trump, Vance speculates about why working-class whites will: cultural anxiety that arises when opioid overdose kills your friends and the political establishment has proven it will throw you under the bus. While his theories may hold up in some corners, in interviews coastal media members have repeatedly asked Vance to speak for the entire white working class.</p> <p>His interviewers and reviewers often seem relieved to find someone with ownership on the topic whose ideas in large part confirm their own. The New York Times election podcast <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/podcasts/understanding-the-trump-voter.html?_r=0\">The Run-Up</a> said Vance\u2019s memoir \u201cdoubles as a cultural anthropology of the white underclass that has flocked to the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s candidacy\u201d. (The Times teased its review of the book with the tweet: \u201cWant to know more about the people who fueled the rise of Donald Trump?\u201d)</p> <p>While Vance happens to have roots in Kentucky mining country, most downtrodden whites are not conservative male Protestants from Appalachia. That sometimes seems the only concept of them that the American consciousness can contain: tucked away in a remote mountain shanty like a coal-dust-covered ghost, as though white poverty isn\u2019t always right in front of us, swiping our credit cards at a Target in Denver or asking for cash on a Los Angeles sidewalk.</p> <p>One-dimensional stereotypes fester where journalism fails to tread. The last time I saw my native class receive substantial focus, before now, was over 20 years ago \u2013 not in the news but on the television show <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseanne\">Roseanne</a>, the fictional storylines of which remain more accurate than the musings of comfortable commentators in New York studios.</p> <p>Countless images of working-class progressives, including women such as Betty, are thus rendered invisible by a ratings-fixated media that covers elections as horse races and seeks sensational b-roll. </p> <p>This media paradigm created the tale of a divided America \u2013 \u201cred\u201d v \u201cblue\u201d\u2013 in which the 42% of Kansans who voted for Barack Obama in 2008 are meaningless. </p> <p>This year, more Kansans <a href=\"http://usuncut.com/politics/bernie-sanders-wins-kansas/\">caucused for Bernie Sanders</a> than for Donald Trump \u2013 a newsworthy point I never saw noted in national press, who perhaps couldn\u2019t fathom that \u201cflyover country\u201d might contain millions of Americans more progressive than their Clinton strongholds. </p> <p>In lieu of such coverage, media makers cast the white working class as a monolith and imply an old, treacherous story convenient to capitalism: that the poor are dangerous idiots.</p> <h2>Poor whiteness and poor character</h2> <p>The two-fold myth about the white working class \u2013 that they are to blame for Trump\u2019s rise, and that those among them who support him for the worst reasons exemplify the rest \u2013 takes flight on the wings of moral superiority affluent Americans often pin upon themselves.</p> <p>I have never seen them flap so insistently as in today\u2019s election commentary, where notions of poor whiteness and poor character are routinely conflated. </p> <p>In an election piece last March in the National Review, writer Kevin Williamson\u2019s assessment of poor white voters \u2013 among whom mortality rates have sharply risen in recent decades \u2013 expressed what many conservatives and liberals alike may well believe when he observed that communities ravaged by oxycodone use \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/nrd/articles/432569/father-f-hrer\">deserve to die</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles,\u201d Williamson wrote. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s speeches make them feel good. So does OxyContin.\u201d</p> <p>For confirmation that this point is lost on most reporters, not just conservative provocateurs, look no further than a recent Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2016/08/31/opiods-and-anti-anxiety-medication-are-killing-white-american-women/\">series</a> that explored spiking <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/white-death/\">death rates</a> among rural white women by fixating on their smoking habits and graphically detailing the \u201chaggard face\u201d and embalming processes of their <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/life-lessons-from-a-small-town-undertaker-as-white-women-die-younger-in-america/2016/08/20/a1e64d76-60b6-11e6-af8e-54aa2e849447_story.html\">corpses</a>. Imagine wealthy white woman examined thusly after their deaths. The outrage among family and friends with the education, time, and agency to write letters to the editor would have been deafening.</p> <p>A sentiment that I care for even less than contempt or degradation is their tender cousin: pity.</p> <p>In a recent op-ed headlined <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/opinion/dignity-and-sadness-in-the-working-class.html\">Dignity and Sadness in the Working Class</a>, David Brooks told of a laid-off Kentucky metal worker he met. On his last day, the man left to rows of cheering coworkers \u2013 a moment I read as triumphant, but that Brooks declared pitiable. How hard the man worked for so little, how great his skills and how dwindling their value, Brooks pointed out, for people he said radiate \u201cthe residual sadness of the lonely heart\u201d.</p> <p>I\u2019m hard-pressed to think of a worse slight than the media figures who have disregarded the embattled white working class for decades now beseeching the country to have sympathy for them. We don\u2019t need their analysis, and we sure don\u2019t need their tears. What we need is to have our stories told, preferably by someone who can walk into a factory without his own guilt fogging his glasses.</p> <p>One such journalist, Alexander Zaitchik, spent several months on the road in six states getting to know white working-class people who do support Trump. His goal for the resulting new book, <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/books/gilded-rage-conversation-trump-supporter-will-surprise-you\">The Gilded Rage</a>, was to convey the human complexity that daily news misses. Zaitchik wrote that his mission arose from frustration with \u201c\u2018hot takes\u2019 written by people living several time zones and income brackets away from their subjects\u201d.</p> <p>Zaitchik wisely described those he met as a \u201cblue-collar middle class\u201d\u2013 mostly white people who have worked hard and lost a lot, whether in the market crash of 2008 or the manufacturing layoffs of recent decades. He found that their motivations overwhelmingly \u201cstarted with economics and ended with economics\u201d. The anger he observed was \u201cpointed up, not down\u201d at those who forgot them when global trade deals were negotiated, not at minority groups.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the racism and nationalism that surely exist among them also exist among Democrats and higher socioeconomic strata. A poll conducted last spring by Reuters <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-trump-idUSKBN0TQ2QT20151208\">found</a> that a third of questioned Democrats supported a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. In another, by YouGov, <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/news/2015/12/09/most-americans-dislike-islam/\">45%</a> of polled Democrats reported holding an unfavorable view of Islam, with almost no fluctuation based on household income. Those who won\u2019t vote for Trump are not necessarily paragons of virtue, while the rest are easily scapegoated as the country\u2019s moral scourge.</p> <p>When Hillary Clinton recently declared half of Trump supporters a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d, Zaitchik told another reporter, the language \u201ccould be read as another way of saying \u2018white-trash bin\u2019.\u201d Clinton quickly apologized for the comment, the context of which contained compassion for many Trump voters. But making such generalizations at a $6m fundraiser in downtown New York City, at which some attendees paid $50,000 for a seat, recalled for me scenes from the television political satire Veep in which powerful Washington figures discuss \u201cnormals\u201d with distaste behind closed doors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"debc21966234342f2a0bad89ca20f9386628f7bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/debc21966234342f2a0bad89ca20f9386628f7bd/0_0_2000_1488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The DeBruce Grain elevator.

Federal safety inspectors had not visited it for 16 years when an explosion ripped through the half-mile long structure, killing seven workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cliff Schiappa/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When we talked, Zaitchik mentioned HBO talk-show host Bill Maher, who he pointed out \u201cbasically makes eugenics-level arguments about anyone who votes for Donald Trump having congenital defects. You would never get away with talking that way about any other group of people and still have a TV show.\u201d</p> <p>Maher is, perhaps, the pinnacle of classist smugness. In the summer of 1998, when I was 17 and just out of high school, I worked at a grain elevator during the wheat harvest. An elevator 50 miles east in Haysville, Kansas, exploded (grain dust is highly combustible), <a href=\"http://www.kansas.com/news/article986253.html\">killing seven workers</a>. The accident rattled my community and reminded us about the physical dangers my family and I often faced as farmers.</p> <p>I kept going to work like everyone else and, after a long day weighing wheat trucks and hauling heavy sacks of feed in and out of the mill, liked to watch Politically Incorrect, the ABC show Maher hosted then. With the search for one of the killed workers\u2019 bodies still under way, Maher joked, as I recall, that the people should check their loaves of Wonder Bread.</p> <p>That moment was perhaps my first reckoning with the hard truth that, throughout my life, I would politically identify with the same people who often insult the place I am from.</p> <p>Such derision is so pervasive that it\u2019s often imperceptible to the economically privileged. Those who write, discuss, and publish newspapers, books, and magazines with best intentions sometimes offend with obliviousness.</p> <p>Many people recommended to me the bestselling new history book <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/22/books/review-white-trash-ruminates-on-an-american-underclass.html\">White Trash</a>, for instance, without registering that its title is a slur that refers to me and the people I love as garbage. My happy relief that someone set out to tell this ignored thread of our shared past was squashed by my wincing every time I saw it on my shelf, so much so that I finally took the book jacket off. Incredibly, promotional copy for the book commits precisely the elitist shaming Isenberg is out to expose: \u201c(the book) takes on our comforting myths about equality, uncovering the crucial legacy of the ever-present, always embarrassing \u2013 if occasionally entertaining \u2013poor white trash.\u201d </p> <p>The book itself is more sensitively wrought and imparts facts that one hopes would dismantle popular use of its titular term. But even Isenberg can\u2019t escape our classist frameworks.</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/americas-long-unaddressed-history-class/\">On the Media</a> host Brooke Gladstone asked Isenberg, earlier this year, to address long-held perceptions of poor whites as bigots, the author described a conundrum:\u201cThey do subscribe to certain views that are undoubtedly racist, and you can\u2019t mask it and pretend that it\u2019s not there. It is very much a part of their thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Entertain a parallel broad statement about any other disenfranchised group, and you might begin to see how rudimentary class discussion is for this relatively young country that long believed itself to be free of castes. Isenberg has sniffed out the hypocrisy in play, though.</p> <p>\u201cThe other problem is when people want to blame poor whites for being the only racist in the room,\u201d she told Gladstone. \u201c\u2026 as if they\u2019re more racist than everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>That problem is rooted in the notion that higher class means higher integrity. As journalist Lorraine Berry wrote last month, \u201cThe story remains that only the ignorant would be racist. Racism disappears with education we\u2019re told.\u201d As the first from my family to hold degrees, I assure you that none of us had to go to college to learn basic human decency.</p> <p>Berry points out that Ivy-League-minted Republicans shepherded the rise of the alt-right. Indeed, it was not poor whites \u2013 not even white Republicans \u2013 who passed legislation bent on preserving segregation, or who watched the Confederate flag raised outside state capitols for decades to come.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t poor whites who criminalized blackness by way of marijuana laws and the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d.</p> <p>Nor was it poor whites who conjured the specter of the black \u201cwelfare queen\u201d.</p> <p>These points should not minimize the horrors of racism at the lowest economic rungs of society, but remind us that those horrors reside at the top in different forms and with more terrible power.</p> <p>Among reporters and commentators this election cycle, then, a steady finger ought be pointed at whites with economic leverage: social conservatives who donate to Trump\u2019s campaign while being too civilized to attend a political rally and yell what they really believe.</p> <h2>Mainstream media is set up to fail the ordinary American</h2> <p>Based on Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric and available data, it appears that most of his voters this November will be people who are getting by well enough but who think of themselves as victims.</p> <p>One thing the media misses is that a great portion of the white working class would align with any sense before victimhood. Right now they are clocking in and out of work, sorting their grocery coupons, raising their children to respect others, and avoiding political news coverage.</p> <p>Barack Obama, a black man formed by the black experience, often cites his maternal lineage in the white working class. \u201cA lot of what\u2019s shaped me came from my grandparents who grew up on the prairie in Kansas,\u201d he <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/obama-thank-god-im-a-country-boy/article/2603608\">wrote</a> this month to mark a White House forum on rural issues. </p> <p>Last year, talking with author Marilynne Robinson for the New York Review of Books, Obama lamented common misconceptions of small-town middle America, for which he has a sort of reverence. \u201cThere\u2019s this huge gap between how folks go about their daily lives and how we talk about our common life and our political life,\u201d he said, naming one cause as \u201cthe filters that stand between ordinary people\u201d who are busy getting by and complicated policy debates. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very encouraged when I meet people in their environments,\u201d Obama told Robinson. \u201cSomehow it gets distilled at the national political level in ways that aren\u2019t always as encouraging.\u201d</p> <p>To be sure, one discouraging distillation \u2013 the caricature of the hate-spewing white male Trump voter with grease on his jeans \u2013 is a real person of sorts. There were one or two in my town: the good ol\u2019 boy who menaces those with less power than himself \u2013 running people of color out of town with the threat of violence, denigrating women, shooting BB guns at stray cats for fun. They are who Trump would be if he\u2019d been born where I was.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t need their analysis, and we sure don\u2019t need their tears. What we need is to have our stories told</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Media fascination with the hateful white Trump voter fuels the theory, now in fashion, that bigotry is the only explanation for supporting him. Certainly, financial struggle does not predict a soft spot for Trump, as cash-strapped people of color \u2013 who face the threat of his racism and xenophobia, and who resoundingly reject him, by all available measures \u2013 can attest. However, one imagines that elite white liberals who maintain an air of ethical grandness this election season would have a harder time thinking globally about trade and immigration if it were their factory job that was lost and their community that was decimated. </p> <p>Affluent analysts who oppose Trump, though, have a way of taking a systemic view when examining social woes but viewing their place on the political continuum as a triumph of individual character. Most of them presumably inherited their political bent, just like most of those in \u201cred\u201d America did. If you were handed liberalism, give yourself no pats on the back for your vote against Trump.</p> <p>Spare, too, the condescending argument that disaffected Democrats who joined Republican ranks in recent decades are \u201cvoting against their own best interests,\u201d undemocratic in its implication that a large swath of America isn\u2019t mentally fit to cast a ballot. </p> <p>Whoever remains on Trump\u2019s side as stories concerning his treatment of women, racism and other dangers continue to unfurl gets no pass from me for any reason. They are capable of voting, and they own their decisions. Let\u2019s be aware of our class biases, though, as we discern who \u201cthey\u201d are.</p> <h2>Journalist? Then the chances are you\u2019re not blue collar</h2> <p>A recent print-edition New York Times cutline <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/opinion/sunday/we-need-somebody-spectacular-views-from-trump-country.html\">described</a> a Kentucky man:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cMitch Hedges, who farms cattle and welds coal-mining equipment. He expects to lose his job in six months, but does not support Mr Trump, who he says is \u2018an idiot.\u2019\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>This made me cheer for the rare spotlight on a member of the white working class who doesn\u2019t support Trump. It also made me laugh \u2013 one can\u2019t \u201cfarm cattle\u201d. One farms crops, and one raises livestock. It\u2019s sometimes hard for a journalist who has done both to take the New York Times seriously.</p> <p>The main reason that national media outlets have a blind spot in matters of class is the lack of socioeconomic diversity within their ranks. Few people born to deprivation end up working in newsrooms or publishing books. So few, in fact, that this former laborer has found cause to shift her entire writing career to talk specifically about class in a wealth-privileged industry, much as journalists of color find themselves talking about race in a whiteness-privileged one.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t to say that one must reside among a given group or place to do it justice, of course, as good muckrakers and commentators have shown for the past century and beyond. See On the Media\u2019s fine new series on poverty, the second episode of which includes Gladstone\u2019s reflection that \u201cthe poor are no more monolithic than the rest of us.\u201d</p> <p>I know journalists to be hard-working people who want to get the story right, and I\u2019m resistant to rote condemnations of \u201cthe media\u201d. The classism of cable-news hosts merely reflects the classism of privileged America in general. It\u2019s everywhere, from tweets describing Trump voters as inbred hillbillies to a Democratic campaign platform that didn\u2019t bother with a specific anti-poverty platform until a month out from the general election.</p> <p>The economic trench between reporter and reported on has never been more hazardous than at this moment of historic wealth disparity, though, when stories focus more often on the stock market than on people who own no stocks. American journalism has been willfully obtuse about the grievances on Main Streets for decades \u2013 surely a factor in digging the hole of resentment that Trump\u2019s venom now fills. That the term \u201cpopulism\u201d has become a pejorative among prominent liberal commentators should give us great pause. A journalism that embodies the plutocracy it\u2019s supposed to critique has failed its watchdog duty and lost the respect of people who call bullshit when they see it. </p> <p>One such person was my late grandfather, Arnie. Men like Trump sometimes drove expensive vehicles up the gravel driveway of our Kansas farmhouse looking to do some sort of business. Grandpa would recognize them as liars and thieves, treat them kindly, and send them packing. If you shook their hands, after they left Grandpa would laugh and say, \u201cBetter count your fingers.\u201d</p> <p>In a world in which the Bettys and Arnies of the world have little voice, those who enjoy a platform from which to speak might examine their hearts and minds before stepping onto the soap box.</p> <p>If you would stereotype a group of people by presuming to guess their politics or deeming them inferior to yourself \u2013 say, the ones who worked third shift on a Boeing floor while others flew to Mexico during spring break; the ones who mopped a McDonald\u2019s bathroom while others argued about the minimum wage on Twitter; the ones who cleaned out their lockers at a defunct Pabst factory while others drank craft beer at trendy bars; the ones who came back from the Middle East in caskets while others wrote op-eds about foreign policy \u2013 then consider that you might have more in common with Trump than you would like to admit.</p>",
  "<h2>\u2018This scary clown thing is a huge distraction\u2019<br></h2> <p><strong>Peanut the clown, Leeds</strong><br></p> <p>I love my job! I have had 35 years of professional clowning. I consciously chose clowning when I could have become a teacher because of the creativity. I am dyslexic but I am a very good teacher so I developed my own system of teaching circus skills as an art form in schools. Over 7000 performances later I am able to work with the shyest children to get them on stage and in a circus show in two hours. It\u2019s not magic - it\u2019s just the class teacher comes with a lot of \u2018background\u2019 that I don\u2019t have. Being a clown, I get the children\u2019s attention and work with their imagination, which is the strongest part of a child\u2019s life until they get to secondary school.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Dxn9yxNmHc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_Dxn9yxNmHc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>I have been aware of the \u2018killer clown\u2019 nonsense for over twenty years - since the Stephen King movie in fact. But this is new. These qualities and the cleverness of the videos that are fueling this craze appeals to children. <br></p> <p> I am so concerned by what has been happening to children in relation to clowning that I am now teaching children mindfulness in schools so they can tell the difference between real and make believe and so learn how to be happy - despite the horrors in the world.</p> <p>I think children\u2019s innocence and safety are the real issue here.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018They\u2019re using the costume, but they\u2019re not professionals\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Porotto the Clown, Leon, Mexico<br></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44f00ad1512f69a8a0e680334a2ca1f1305bfa77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44f00ad1512f69a8a0e680334a2ca1f1305bfa77/0_48_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Porotto performing the goldfish story for kids in Mexico.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Porotto performing the goldfish story for kids in Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Porotto the clown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m from Leon city in Mexico. I studied neuropsychology, and currently work in a public library as a storyteller using clown craft. I like poetry, and adapt short stories as theatrical performances.. I look up to Slava Polunin, Rowan Atkinson, Marceau and Charlot among others. <br></p> <p>I like to read about theatrical theory and study to contextualize our work. Clowns work on human emotions: our body is poetry, and self-reflection - both for ourselves and the people who enjoy the show.. It\u2019s been said that \u201claughter is health\u201d - it\u2019s true, but a clown explores hate, fear, sadness, and certainly joy. </p> <p>There\u2019s a media culture in which clowns seem like monsters or worse. There is nothing good in Ronald McDonald, creepy films like \u201cThe Clown, or George Gaccy, the \u201cclown killer\u201d. <br></p> <p>There are peoplewho use a clown\u2019s costume, but they\u2019re not clowns. They\u2019re not professional.</p> <p>A clown isn\u2019t an actor. We\u2019re people, sharing our feelings with humor and our moods. Because the people are clowns too. Everybody should laugh at themselves.<br></p> <p>A clown is more than an artist. It\u2019s a way of life.</p> <h2>\u2018Clowns by their very nature are resilient\u2019<br></h2> <p><strong>Samantha Holdsworth<br></strong></p> <p>I am the Founder of Clowns Without Borders UK. Our clown work is unusual because we perform in crisis zones and for refugee children. We got back from performing in refugee camps in Greece last week. It\u2019s a joyful, often tough and humbling job. We have the privilege and responsibility of reminding children, in the worst of circumstances, that it\u2019s OK to be a child, we do this by making fools of ourselves. <br></p> <p>Some people might say we have no business being in crisis zones however, these moments of joy that are specifically created for children in crisis are vital and should be part of everyday life. But they are not. Every child deserves to be a child regardless of circumstances and that\u2019s why clowns are so important in this circumstances. Big NGO\u2019s call it psychosocial first aid, we call it \u2018laughter-aid\u2019.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"983ae7aa208039d06366c975525793119659ec57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/983ae7aa208039d06366c975525793119659ec57/0_27_810_486/500.jpg\" alt=\"Clowns without Borders on a tour to Greek refugee camps.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clowns without Borders on a tour to Greek refugee camps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cowns Without Borders</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a compliment when people think this work is easy, it means what we\u2019re doing looks effortless, when really we\u2019ve trained for years, rehearsed routines over and over again and most importantly we are skilled at listening to our audience. You can\u2019t just walk into a complex situation and start being crazy, that would be scary! It requires a certain sensitivity. <br></p> <p>You need a gentleness that speaks to children and practice is essential. Through our clowning we are saying to the children we are here for and we care about you. It\u2019s only through this approach, which really comes from the heart, that the children can trust us and therefore let go. When that happens, anything is possible, like pretending we are all chickens and laughing together. <br></p> <p>Coulrophobia, the fear of clowns, is real and needs to be respected. This [craze] is certainly not going to help. However, there\u2019s a big difference between an actual clown and men in scary masks. I think the British public are able to discern the difference.</p> <p>Clowns by their very nature are resilient, we bounce back! We\u2019ve been around for centuries; long after these bozos in silly masks are gone we\u2019ll still be here sharing laughter and happiness.<br></p>",

increases to offset rising costs were a normal part of doing business. \u201cWe are taking price increases in the UK. That is a normal devaluation-led cycle,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He said he was confident the dispute would be \u201cresolved pretty quickly\u201d.</p> \n<p>The UK accounts for less than 5% of Unilever\u2019s business, Pitkethly said, as the company announced better than expected quarterly results after pushing through price increases around the world. The company posted underlying sales growth of 3.2% for the past three months, ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations.</p> \n<p>UK consumers, however, have been told to brace themselves for price rises.

  "<p>Until a few months ago, Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez was a government health promoter in central El Salvador. His job was to visit poor families and ensure their children attended school and received health checks, in exchange for modest cash benefits.<br></p> <p>One day in March, on his way to visit a family in a neighbourhood controlled by the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) gang, Hern\u00e1ndez witnessed a beating by gang members.

So when he returned to visit the same family a month later, he took a different route and left his uniform at home in hope of going unnoticed. </p> <p>But he was spotted by gang informants, and the same four youngsters confronted Hern\u00e1ndez with baseball bats, accusing him of spying for a rival group. </p> <p>\u201cThey took down my address from my identity card, and threatened to kill my whole family if they ever saw me again.

Then Moses will be tested yet again.</p> <p>I note also that Moses was critical of the Guardian for failing to join Ipso, a position I have long supported.

We are Liberty students who are disappointed with President Falwell\u2019s endorsement and are tired of being associated with one of the worst presidential candidates in American history. Donald Trump does not represent our values and we want nothing to do with him.</p> <p>A majority of Liberty students, faculty, and staff feel as we do. Donald Trump received a pitiful 90 votes from Liberty students in Virginia\u2019s primary election, a colossal rejection of his campaign. Nevertheless, President Falwell eagerly uses his national platform to advocate for Donald Trump. While he occasionally clarifies that supporting Trump is not the official position of Liberty University, he knows it is his title of president of the largest Christian university in the world that gives him political credentials.</p> <p>Associating any politician with Christianity is damaging to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. But Donald Trump is not just any politician. He has made his name by maligning others and bragging about his sins. Not only is Donald Trump a bad candidate for president, he is actively promoting the very things that we as Christians ought to oppose.</p> <p>A recently uncovered tape revealed his comments bragging about sexually assaulting women. Any faculty or staff member at Liberty would be terminated for such comments, and yet when Donald Trump makes them, President Falwell rushes eagerly to his defense \u2013 taking the name \u201cLiberty University\u201d with him. \u201cWe\u2019re all sinners,\u201d Falwell told the media, as if sexual assault is a shoulder-shrugging issue rather than an atrocity which plagues college campuses across America, including our own.</p> <p>It is not enough to criticize these kinds of comments. We must make clear to the world that while everyone is a sinner and everyone can be forgiven, a man who constantly and proudly speaks evil does not deserve our support for the nation\u2019s highest office.</p> <p>Jesus tells a story in the Bible about a man who tries to remove a speck of dust from his brother\u2019s eye, while he has a log stuck in his own. \u201cYou hypocrite,\u201d Jesus says, \u201cfirst take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother\u2019s eye.\u201d</p> <p>We Liberty students are often told to support Donald Trump because the other leading candidate is a bad option. Perhaps this is true. But the only candidate who is directly associated with Liberty University is Donald Trump.</p> <p>Because our president has led the world to believe that Liberty University supports Donald Trump, we students must take it upon ourselves to make clear that Donald Trump is absolutely opposed to what we believe, and does not have our support.</p> <p>We are not proclaiming our opposition to Donald Trump out of bitterness, but out of a desire to regain the integrity of our school. While our president Jerry Falwell Jr. tours the country championing the log in his eye, we want the world to know how many students oppose him. We don\u2019t want to champion Donald Trump; we want only to be champions for Christ.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57feda24e4b03b22b4fb2c62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T00:50:44.194Z\">1.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Clinton campaign has responded to Trump campaign advisor Roger Stone\u2019s statements that he has had \u201cback-channel communications\u201d with Wikileaks, the organization that has released hacked documents and emails from the DNC and Clinton campaign.</p> <p>\u201cIt is disturbing that Roger Stone, a longtime Donald Trump confidante, has confirmed the fact that has \u2018back-channel communications\u2019 with Wikileaks, an organization that is working with the Russian government to affect the American presidential election,\u201d said Glen Caplin.</p> <p>\u201cIt is also now clear that the illegal hack of John Podesta\u2019s email is the work of the Russian government, according to the FBI.

You cherrypick what he says and you want to talk about it for days on end with a breaking news tag on it.

He sought to explain: \u201cSo I\u2019m standing at my podium by my chair. She walks across the room, she\u2019s standing in front of me right next to me ...

If we had a little help from our weak leadership, called our Republican leadership, we\u2019d be sailing like you\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d</p> <p>He also criticised the media for giving too little coverage to revelations from WikiLeaks. Pointing to journalists at the rally, he said: \u201cThese guys are so crooked \u2013 they\u2019re worse than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>.

I think if we got along with the Russians, that would be good, and frankly, if we got along with the Russians and knocked the hell out of Isis, that would be good. That would be smart \u2013 but we don\u2019t run government smart.\u201d</p> <p>In a bizarre aside, Trump even took on the NFL over its new regulations to limit concussions. \u201cA little ding in the head you can\u2019t play the rest of the season,\u201d he said mockingly.</p> <p>But the Democratic candidate remained his primary target. \u201cIt\u2019s a choice between the pessimism of Hillary Clinton and the optimism of a movement powered by millions of people all over the country... She shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run for president. Based on her crimes, she should not be allowed to run for president ...

If Clinton wins, meaning Vice-President Tim Kaine would hold the casting vote in the Senate, meaning the Democrats would only need to pick up four seats to control the upper chamber. The Republicans currently have 54 Senate seats, and the Democrats 44, along with two independents who caucus with them.</p> <p>In two tight Senate contests, Nevada and New Hampshire, GOP candidates on Saturday announced they could no longer stomach Trump, and called on him to withdraw. On Monday, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, fired another salvo at Trump by saying he would no longer campaign for him or defend him, and told members they should feel free to focus on their own survival.</p> <p>\u201cI think Republicans were feeling pretty good about the Congress a couple weeks ago, but this morning they\u2019re very worried,\u201d former representative Vin Weber told the Guardian on Monday. Weber has helped raise funds for a politically-active non-profit, the American Action Network, and an allied Super Pac, the Congressional Leadership Fund, that are trying to keep the GOP majority.

He won the Andy Kaufman award (given to those who \u201cdo not define themselves by the typical conventions of comedy\u201d) in 2011. \u201cA much more powerful canvas than subject matter about traffic or Starbucks, but still just a canvas. Comedians can be public intellectuals, but trying to be a public intellectual doesn\u2019t make you a comedian \u2026 Just because you\u2019re angry about whatever injustice is happening in society, just the mere fact you\u2019re talking about it doesn\u2019t make it comedy.\u201d<br></p> <p>Right now, he says, \u201cthe weekly cultural/national/global atrocity happens and everyone needs to put their two cents in on it. And you wade through page after page on your Facebook of comics trying to craft that perfect post that truly puts that week\u2019s injustice in perspective.\u201d</p> <p>Which touches on something the comedian <a href=\"http://www.brentweinbach.com/\">Brent Weinbach</a> said: it didn\u2019t matter if the artist was taking an explicitly innovative step or not \u2013 it was also about how they used the form. Larry Wilmore told jokes that had a borscht belt-styled echo to them, but he made The Nightly Show his own. Nina Conti does standup as a ventriloquist, but in a way that\u2019s unique to her. Stephen Colbert went from biting satire on The Colbert Report to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10154836314315329\">defending the form of the late-night monologue to Ben Smith</a>, saying: \u201cThe people who created this form weren\u2019t dummies or lazy.

Over the years, the party has advocated the repeal of gravity, that Canada\u2019s currency be changed to bubble gum so that it could be inflated and deflated \u201cat will\u201d, <a href=\"https://mononcqc.wordpress.com/2007/03/19/rhinoceros-party-of-canada-or-why-canada-used-to-own-politics/\">breeding a mosquito that would only hatch in January so that \u201cthe little buggers will freeze to death</a>\u201d, and more. <br> </p> <p>And people voted for this. So if people vote for a theoretical American Rhinoceros party, what would critics subsequently say about comedy\u2019s influence on politics? And why do these questions never seem to take into account the demonstrable seriousness of Al Franken, or J\u00f3n Gnarr, who served as the mayor of Reykjav\u00edk for four years? (Let alone the chaotic danger Beppe Grillo represents in Italy?)<br>  Comedians love to tap into the relationship between the promise of knowledge being power and power being meaningless. But comedy is comedy. And power is power. </p>",
  "<p>Earlier this year, George Saunders wrote <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/11/george-saunders-goes-to-trump-rallies\">an article for the New Yorker about Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign</a> in which he described an America \u201cintellectually and emotionally weakened by years of steadily degraded public discourse\u201d, divided into \u201ctwo separate ideological countries, LeftLand and RightLand, speaking different languages, the lines between us down. Not only do our two sub-countries reason differently; they draw upon non-intersecting data sets and access entirely different mythological systems.\u201d</p> <p>This riven America has always been Saunders\u2019s great subject: there is a reason why his first collection is called CivilWarLand in Bad Decline, with its title story set in a war re-enactment theme park; and it is the same reason why, 20 years later, his forthcoming first novel focuses on Abraham Lincoln in the early 1860s.

Aside from being one of the funniest writers around, it is difficult to think of anyone better than he is at describing how commercial imperatives deform individual lives. The powerlessness of the individual haunts his stories, the sense of citizens being to multinationals as flies to wanton boys. \u201c\u2018I pour my life\u2019s blood into this place,\u2019\u201d the narrator\u2019s father says in the early story Isabelle (1994), \u201c\u2018and you offer me half what I paid?\u2019 \u2018Market forces at work\u2019,\u201d the estate agent replies, a line that is virtually impossible to argue with, both within the confines of the story and without. Variants of it occur again and again in his work, expressing the idea, as he put it in 2001, \u201cthat our public institutions \u2013 our companies and our government and our media \u2013 absolutely affect our ability to exist gracefully in the world\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMarket forces at work.\u201d The words could be a top-line summary of Saunders\u2019s stories, whether their focus is demeaning wage slavery (stripping at a chain restaurant; inhabiting a lonely cave on the outskirts of a vast theme park), advertising (<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/01/27/jon\">the nightmarish marketing research facility of Jon</a>; the consumerist, Philip K Dickian society of My Flamboyant Grandson), the military (the angry, isolated veteran of Home), or drug testing (on chimps in the bleak lab report of 93990, and convicted felons in the more satirical <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmKKofJOyAE\">Escape from Spiderhead</a>). </p> <p>These stories are rife with euphemism, those phrases Saunders identifies as ways of enabling the unsayable to be spoken, and the unthinkable to be broached. Employers talk of \u201cstaff remixing\u201d, not layoffs, and urge their employees to \u201cTell the truth. Start generating frank and nonbiased assessments of [your] subpar colleague,\u201d while researchers who kill their human test subjects exonerate themselves by announcing they are merely obeying \u201cthe mandates of science\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2013/jul/05/george-saunders-rick-gekoski-podcast\">Guardian Books podcast: George Saunders and summer reading</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Saunders is often called a surrealist, a fabulist or an allegorist, but his work contains a lot of recognisable reality, often in the form of people worrying about how to balance insufficient income and excessive expenditure. This, from <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/10/15/the-semplica-girl-diaries\">The Semplica Girl Diaries</a> (2012), captures the rising panic of a father working every angle to move his family another rung up the social ladder: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Visa full. Also AmEx full and Discover nearly full. Called Discover: $200 avail. If we transfer $200 from checking (once paycheck comes in), would then have $400 avail. on Discover, could get cheetah. Although timing problematic. Currently, checking at zero. Paycheck must come, must put paycheck in checking pronto, hope paycheck clears quickly. And then, when doing bills, pick bills totalling $200 to not pay. To defer paying. </p> </blockquote> <p>The \u201cSGs\u201d themselves are economic migrants, who leave their families to decorate suburban American lawns (the girls are strung from their heads via a microline threaded though their brain that \u201cdoes no damage, causes no pain\u201d). They are a pungent symbol of the way the west exploits third-world poverty. For much of its length, the Semplica Girls inhabit its edges, just as for the narrator, whose diary we are reading, they are marginal presences crowded out by the status anxiety he feels for his children: \u201cLord, give us more. Give us enough. Help us not fall behind peers. Help us not, that is, to fall further behind peers. For kids\u2019 sake. Do not want them scarred by how far behind we are.\u201d</p> <p>This anxious father, barely tolerated by his children, is a stock character in Saunders\u2019s fiction. \u201cI\u2019ve done my best\u201d one screams in Bounty (1995). \u201cPitiful!\u201d his wife screams back. Bounty is the longest story in his first collection, and combines several of Saunders\u2019s key themes: not only the loser dad, but also a theme park patronised by the rich and staffed by the disenfranchised poor, and an apocalyptic US governed more by private companies than elected officials (\u201cour corporations\u201d, he writes in his Trump essay, \u201cthose new and powerful nation-states\u201d). Like the country his contemporary and friend David Foster Wallace created in Infinite Jest, Bounty is a vision of where millennial America might end up after another 25 years of bad decisions:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I sit on the deck of the barge with a semiautomatic. The water\u2019s brown. As prescribed by federal regs, all inflow pipes are clearly labelled. RAW SEWAGE, says one. VERY POSSIBLY THORIUM, says another. </p> </blockquote> <p>Humour is intrinsic to Saunders\u2019s project; it both sharpens and makes palatable his vision of humanity\u2019s tendency towards predation. But as the extract above indicates, it was more antic and farcical in his earlier collections. The jokes in CivilWarLand in Bad Decline (1996) are very funny, but arrive with a relentlessness that can become mechanical, whereas the comedy in Tenth of December (2013) is richer, arising more from character than situation. In his essay on Donald Barthelme, a writer whose style of absurdist humour is deeply imprinted on CivilWarLand (Barry Hannah being another discernible presence), Saunders writes that \u201c[s]ome part of art, certainly of Barthelme\u2019s art, involves the simple pleasure of watching someone be audacious\u201d, and there is a sense that this was enough for the younger Saunders, whose vision Joyce Carol Oates once described as \u201ccruel\u201d. </p> <p>From today\u2019s vantage, it is a strange word to read in relation to Saunders, someone who is often cited as continuing the project of working towards a moral fiction that David Foster Wallace once stated as his goal; a practising Buddhist who is cast as fighting the good fight against capitalism\u2019s cruellest excesses; a sage who, like Wallace before him, has had <a href=\"http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/george-saunderss-advice-to-graduates/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=2&amp;\">a speech to students packaged up as an inspirational tract</a>. But the early stories really do display cruelty, at least in part: much is made of disability, children are killed off at an alarming rate (this tendency, it so happens, has persisted: wherever you find yourself in Saunders\u2019s fiction, you are never many pages from a dead child), and characters are forced out of difficult situations into impossible, agonising ones. This soliloquy, from The 400-Pound CEO (1993), captures the world in which much of the early fiction plays out:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have a sense that God is unfair and preferentially punishes his weak, his dumb, his fat, his lazy. I believe he takes more pleasure in his perfect creatures, and cheers them on like a brainless dad as they run roughshod over the rest of us. He gives us a need for love, and no way to get any. He gives us a desire to be liked, and personal attributes that make us utterly unlikable. Having placed his flawed and needy children in a world of exacting specifications, he deducts the difference between what we have and what we need from our hearts and our self-esteem and our mental health. </p> </blockquote> <p>But if Saunders was more callous towards his characters in the past, he has always positioned them within a moral landscape. The world he describes may seem to be beyond repair, and yet the urge to repair it persists. In his introduction to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Saunders writes that Twain\u2019s novel \u201clocates itself squarely on our National Dilemma, which is: How can anyone be truly free in a country as violent and stupid as ours?\u201d Saunders returns to the same moral conundrum again and again. \u201cAs soon as I start writing\u201d, he told Ben Marcus in 2004, \u201cthings start to unfold around some central moral vector, and that\u2019s that\u201d. Inevitably, at some point in a Saunders story, an ethical decision has to be made. Like Flannery O\u2019Connor, a writer who had a moral vision of forbidding harshness, Saunders enjoys stripping things down to the basics and setting two characters on a collision course. Think of Morse and Cummings in The Falls, or the drowning boy and the suicidal old man Eber in Tenth of December. Two people with opposing views set on an intersecting path: a fundamentally dramatic situation, and also, often, a moral one. In The Falls, the stressed dad Morse and the poet manqu\u00e9 Cummings walk alongside a river, each absorbed in their own frustrations. When they see, from their alternate vantage points, two girls in a canoe heading for the falls, a clear moral question is being posed. It is Morse who replies, throwing himself to almost certain death in order to try and save the girls, who, we are told, \u201cwere basically dead\u201d already. The story\u2019s final line \u2013 \u201che kicked off his loafers and threw his long ugly body out across the water\u201d \u2013 resonates with a sense of the heroism that resides in the everyday, and the belief that it is what we attempt to do that defines us, rather than what we succeed in doing. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/dec/28/tenth-of-december-by-george-saunders-a-book-to-make-you-love-people-again\">Tenth of December by George Saunders \u2013 a book to make you love people again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Reading Saunders in quantity, you get the sense that if The Falls continued beyond its abrupt end, Morse might not be pointed to as a hero but derided as a fool. An aspect of morality that Saunders is particularly interested in is the pressure that one person doing the right thing exerts on the vast majority of regular people who prefer to bump along with the blinkers on, making immoral or at least amoral choices and not appreciating being made to think about it. Brad Carrigan, American, from Saunders\u2019s most overtly political collection, In Persuasion Nation (2006), is an ingenious study of the way morality breeds resentment. The story is a fantasy in which the main characters appear to be living inside a surreal sitcom. They hear music announcing commercial breaks, or to signify that the contents of their suburban back garden have \u201cmorphed again\u201d, and \u201cthe familiar Carrigan backyard is now a vast field of charred human remains\u201d. </p> <p>It so happens that these slaughtered tribespeople can still communicate (ghosts are another Saunders trope). Brad befriends them, and is saddened by the story they relate. He tries to help them, but only succeeds in alienating his wife and her lover, Chief Wayne. She tells him:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Oh, you break my heart. Why does everything have to be so sad to you? Why do you have so many negative opinions about things you don\u2019t know about, like foreign countries and diseases and everything? Why can\u2019t you be more like Chief Wayne? He has zero opinions. He\u2019s just upbeat.</p> </blockquote> <p>Unable to simultaneously maintain his ethical standpoint and function in his domestic environment, Brad is consigned to a grey space where misfits get \u201cWritten Out\u201d. Fittingly for someone whose compassion has made his existence untenable, his final utterance as he dissipates into nothingness is the repeated phrase: \u201cPoor things.\u201d The story is a masterpiece of Saundersian juxtaposition: satirical and absurd but heartfelt, and bleak but intensely funny. What better form for a critique of a divided country to take than a radical split between registers? </p> <p>To return to Twain (who also wrote about two Americas, and chose a fitting name to do it under), the things Saunders identifies most clearly in his predecessor\u2019s writing are also true of his own. Twain \u201cstarted his career being purely funny\u201d, Saunders explains, and \u201cdid not establish an agenda and carry it through, but wrote as the spirit moved him, in as improvisatory manner as ever writer ever did\u201d. Likewise, Saunders has often spoken of attending not to theme, or overall structure, but to the individual sentence: get that right, and the rest, he says, will fall into place. \u201cHuck Finn\u201d, he writes, \u201cis a great book because it tells the truth about the human condition in a way that delights us\u201d. Saunders\u2019s most successful stories work in the same way, leading us along new and surprising pathways to arrive at fundamental truths.</p>",
  "<p>Last night featured the NHL debut of heavily hyped Toronto Maple Leafs rookie Auston Matthews. It was a big moment for the franchise, which hasn\u2019t had an elite-level prospect in at least a generation or two. The buildup to the game was very exciting. It was also all very confusing for Maple Leaf fans, who aren\u2019t used to actually having something to feel optimistic about.</p> <p>How do I know? Because I am a Leafs fan, and have been for over 30 years. So I get where Leafs Nation is coming from on this one. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m also an unbiased sportswriter, and you can trust me to handle this assignment objectively.</p> <p>Anyway, Matthews finally made his long-awaited debut on Wednesday night. And in the very first game of the NHL regular-season schedule, on the road against a divisional rival in front of a national TV audience, Matthews went out and had what may well be the greatest debut game in the history of the NHL.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/12/auston-matthews-hat-trick-toronto-maple-leafs-nhl-debut\">Matthews becomes first in NHL's 100-year history to score four goals in debut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That sounds like hyperbole, but it\u2019s really not. Let\u2019s run through what we just witnessed, in handy Q&amp;A format.</p> <h2>OK, so what just happened?</h2> <p>Matthews didn\u2019t take long to get on the scoreboard, converting a slick setup in front to score his first career goal just eight minutes into the game. The goal came on his first career shot, matching the achievement of another first overall pick, Mario Lemieux. He was just getting started.</p> <p>Eight minutes later, Matthews picked the pocket of two-time Norris Trophy winner Erik Karlsson to score his second goal of the period. He finished the hat trick early in the second by ripping a wrist shot from the face-off circle. That made him one of only five players in modern NHL history to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FriedgeHNIC/status/786365050873274371\">record a hat trick in his first game</a>. </p> <p>At that point, sensing the need to build some suspense, Matthews went over 18 minutes before scoring again. His fourth of the night, on a nifty two-on-one feed from fellow rookie Willian Nylander, officially put him in uncharted territory as the first player since the advent of the forward pass to score four times in his first NHL game.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpWZoVXJZj0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tpWZoVXJZj0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Four shots, four goals: a debut for the ages.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Needless to say, this was all very exciting for long-suffering Maple Leafs fans. But again, I\u2019m an objective sportswriter, so I can handle it.</p> <h2>So who is Auston Matthews?</h2> <p>WHOEVER HE DAMN WELL WANTS TO BE! WHOOO! SUCK IT, 29 OTHER FAN BASES!</p> <h2>You OK, bud?</h2> <p>Sorry. Sorry, I can do this. Give me another try.</p> <h2>So who is Auston Matthews?</h2> <p>Matthews is a center from Arizona who cut his teeth with the US National Under-18 Team before heading to Switzerland last year to play his draft season against professionals. He\u2019d been the consensus top prospect in the 2016 draft for at least two seasons, and after winning the draft lottery in April, the Maple Leafs surprised nobody by taking him with the first overall pick. After an impressive showing as part of Team North America at the World Cup in September, he joined the Leafs at training camp and earned a spot on the opening night roster. He\u2019s big, plays a strong two-way game, has excellent vision and hockey sense, and a wrist shot that\u2019s been compared to Joe Sakic\u2019s.</p> <h2>Wait, did you just say Arizona? They make hockey players?</h2> <p>Not really, but here we are. Matthews actually has a <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/why-everyone-in-hockey-is-talking-about-auston-matthews-toronto-maple-leafs/article30508528/\">hell of an origin story</a>. He grew up playing baseball, but became a hockey fan after attending a Phoenix Coyotes game as a child. His parents had to struggle to support his development \u2013 just finding available ice time was a challenge in Arizona \u2013 but did what they could to support his dream. He eventually moved to Michigan to join the US national program, only to break his leg and miss three months. But by 2014, he was being <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/27/sports/though-ice-is-in-short-supply-arizona-warms-up-to-hockey.html\">described as a prodigy</a>, and was well on his way to becoming the top prospect in hockey.</p> <p>But it all started back with that Coyotes game. Canadian fans felt bad when the Winnipeg Jets moved to Arizona in 1996, but it turns out it was all totally worth it. Thanks Winnipeg! Sorry you <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peZEcmo3CsU&amp;t=8m19s\">came in second in the draft lottery</a>. </p> <h2>And then last night, he scored four goals in his first two periods?</h2> <p>He did indeed. That put him on pace to score six in regulation, which would have tied the modern NHL record. But he wisely decided to shut it down and not score any more goals for the rest of the night, because it\u2019s important to save something for game two.</p> <p>Also, his record-setting debut <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Buccigross/status/786371322444128257\">made his mom cry</a>, which was really sweet.</p> <h2>Just curious, but who ended up winning the game? </h2> <p>Literally nobody cares.</p> <h2>Do you have any ridiculous stats that don\u2019t really fit anywhere else in the story but which you can use this Q&amp;A format to wedge in anyway?</h2> <p>I sure do! Let\u2019s try this one: Heading into last night, there had been 666 rookie seasons in the century-long history of the Toronto Maple Leafs franchise. In one game, Matthews <a href=\"http://www.hockey-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;rookie=Y&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;franch_id=TOR&amp;pos=S&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;threshhold=5&amp;order_by=goals\">passed 483 of those</a> on the Leafs\u2019 all-time full-season rookie goal-scoring leaderboard.</p> <h2>So Maple Leafs fans must be planning the parade today, right?</h2> <p>Oh lord no. This is all going to end terribly. Every Maple Leafs fan knows that. Well, maybe not all of us \u2013 there are probably some very small children who haven\u2019t been at this very long and think things might actually end well and people might get to be happy. But the rest of us know that the hockey gods are setting us up for something terrible. Whether it\u2019s a career-ending injury, an alien abduction, or a sudden change of heart that he\u2019d really prefer baseball after all, this is all headed somewhere awful. </p> <p>The hockey gods are just setting us up right now. It\u2019s still the Maple Leafs. It all ends in tears.</p> <h2>Wow. You guys are depressing.</h2> <p>Yeah.</p> <h2>But for now \u2026</h2> <p>We all plan to be completely insufferable!</p> <p>Seriously, last night may have been the Maple Leafs\u2019 highlight of the last dozen years. That sounds completely pathetic, but it\u2019s probably true. The Leafs have only made the playoffs once since the 2004 lockout and that one ended, shall we say, <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/reliving-maple-leafs-devastating-game-7-collapse/\">sub-optimally</a>. Other than that, it\u2019s been the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2khZeQl0o_Q\">Mats Sundin 500th goal</a>, that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qdYul7Lo-8\">one win against the Habs</a>, a few Brian Burke one-liners, and a whole lot of hard liquor. Let us have this.</p> <p>And yes, it\u2019s all downhill from here. Matthews will hit his first slump, the dumber fans among us will turn on him, somebody in the media will create some fake controversy to get attention, and everyone will start look back at this night and point and laugh at us for getting our hopes up.</p> <p>But that\u2019s in the future. For now, Maple Leafs fans are feeling \u2026 I don\u2019t know, whatever that word is that means the opposite of sad. You\u2019re going to want to avoid us for the next few days. If you\u2019re at work today and you see a Maple Leaf fan walking or, let\u2019s be honest, cart-wheeling down the hall towards you, pull the fire alarm and run. </p> <p>We\u2019ll understand. And we won\u2019t care. We have Auston Matthews. We have the greatest rookie in NHL history, even if we know it won\u2019t last. For at least a few days, we finally get to feel good about ourselves. </p>",

range of goods by about 10%, blaming the falling value of the pound against the euro and the dollar.</p> \n<p>The row will be embarrassing for the supermarket\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, who previously held a senior role at Unilever. It also comes after Tesco made sweeping changes to the way its buyers deal with suppliers after strong criticism from the industry watchdog, the Grocery Code Adjudicator.</p> \n<p>A Tesco spokesperson said: \u201cWe are experiencing availability issues on a number of Unilever products. We always work to ensure customers get the best possible prices and we hope to have this issue resolved soon.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unilever is one of the UK\u2019s biggest suppliers of branded foods and household goods and the dispute could have serious consequences for both sides. </p> \n<p>In different areas of the country a number of Unilever brands have sold out. They include Persil, Surf, Dove, Comfort, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream, Elmlea, Colman\u2019s, Helmann\u2019s, Marmite, Knorr, Bertolli, Flora, Comfort and Pot Noodle. </p> \n<p>It is understood that Unilever has approached a number of the major retailers in an attempt to increase prices. One well-informed source said: \u201cUnilever is using Brexit as an excuse to raise prices, even on products that are made in the UK.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst at TCC Global, said Unilever\u2019s attempt to increase prices was not surprising and reflected attempts by a large number of supermarket suppliers to offset cost increases. He suggested there were likely to be more disputes between retailers and suppliers.</p> \n<p>\u201cA lot of suppliers are seeking to pass on price increases to retailers but in the current environment retailers are increasingly reluctant to take it. They want to keep prices as low as they can to increase their affordability against the competition.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/great-marmite-war-reality-brexit-bite\">With the great Marmite war, the reality of Brexit has started to bite | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It emerged earlier this week that confidence in the food and drink industry is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/food-industry-shaken-by-hard-brexit-prospects-survey-reveals\">increasingly fragile since the upheaval caused by the EU referendum result</a>.</p> \n<p>Ged Futter, a retail consultant at IR Solutions, which advises suppliers on how to negotiate with retailers, said the fall in the value of the pound was having a huge impact on those importing goods. \u201cA lot of suppliers have seen costs go up significantly because of currency. Some are covered until the end of the year but not beyond. Retailers are saying they can\u2019t pass cost increases on to their shoppers but that has to happen, or they are not going to have any suppliers left,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Details of the standoff between Tesco and Unilever emerged just a few hours after Justin King, a former boss of Sainsbury\u2019s, warned that supermarkets could not absorb cost increases caused by the falling pound and that price rises were inevitable.</p> \n<p>Serious disputes over price are not that unusual in the grocery sector. Roberts said it was usually the retailer who ended up backing down because shoppers demanded certain brands.</p> \n<p>In 2011, Tesco refused to stock a number of Premier Foods\u2019 brands, including Oxo and Ambrosia, after the supplier tried to pass on a 14% increase in costs. The two fell out the previous year over Hovis when Premier, citing soaring wheat prices, tried to raise the price of its loaves.</p> \n<p>Unilever declined to comment on the dispute with Tesco.</p>",

In question time, O\u2019Dwyer was asked a very detailed question about her portfolio, which she obviously could not answer. Labor then asked a series of questions, some of which were ruled out of order, which asked Turnbull why he wasn\u2019t sacking O\u2019Dwyer and justice minister Michael Keenan. Labor suggested the government lost their first vote when Keenan left parliament early and the second vote when Keenan was in the chamber. <br></strong></li> <li><strong>Barnaby Joyce suggested people shouldn\u2019t make threats when asked about interventions by George Christensen and Andrew Broad, suggesting they would take their bats home if the government allowed a free vote. But Joyce has also been very clear that if the plebiscite fails, it\u2019s all over for this term of government. <br></strong></li> <li><strong>Meanwhile the plebiscite bill is still in the house. Even though the bill was scheduled to go to be clear of the house on Tuesday and into the senate on Wednesday. As of close of business, there is now no chance for the plebiscite to go to the senate until the week of November 7 - given next week senate estimates. There has been a long list of speakers in the house, to the point of which there has been speculation as to whether there is a filibuster going on. This scenario would be slightly incomprehensible, unless it is a time buying exercise to gauge public reaction. <br></strong></li> <li><strong>NXT senator Stirling Griff gave his first speech. The SA senator called for</strong> <strong>government ownership of essential utilities including electricity, water and gas and the national broadband network.</strong></li> <li><strong>Andrew Wilkie and Cathy McGowan have flagged their motion calling for the Choppergate recommendations into politicians \u201centitlements\u201d be enforced. They want real time disclosure of spending, better information of the purpose of visits and to call it by its proper names - work expenses, no less. What is the world coming to?</strong></li> </ul> <p>Thanks for your company this week. Apologies for the fragmented afternoon but we had a little podcast to put together. Thanks to <strong>Gareth Hutchens, Paul Karp, Katharine Murphy</strong> and <strong>Mike Bowers for their contributions. </strong></p> <p>Tomorrow, we have Gunfight at the OK Corral, with <strong>George Brandis</strong> and <strong>Justin Gleeson</strong> appearing at the senate committee to explain their dispute. The schedule, formerly online, has been taken down. We hear Brandis is now appearing later at 12.30pm. Because the program is not online anymore, we don\u2019t know who else is appearing.</p> <p>As for politicslive, we will be back next week, for the house sitting and senate estimates where the job description is to keep eyes across the chamber and four or five different committee rooms.

In effect, it is a tax increase by stealth. For example, a person earning $79,000 who got a 2% wage rise to $80,580, goes from paying a marginal tax rate of 32.5% to 37%.</p> <p>But we need a bit of context. They would only be paying 37% tax for the $579 they earned above $80,001. The rest would be unchanged.</p> <p>The tax changes mean that now instead of going into a higher tax bracket, this person would remain with a tax rate of 32.5%. It makes a difference of $26 a year less in tax.</p> <p><strong>The biggest tax cut anyone will get is those who earn over $87,001 \u2013 they will get a cut of $315 a year, or $6 a week.</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T01:38:59.266Z\">at 2.38am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fed892e4b03b22b4fb2c5b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T00:46:05.660Z\">1.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> I told you there has been a storm of legislation.<br></p> <p>*1 <strong>MR PORTER</strong> <strong>:</strong> To present a bill for an act to amend the law relating to social security, and for related purposes.

The financial services minister, <strong>Kelly O\u2019Dwyer</strong>, was in the chair, which means she was in charge on the government side with the usual staffers.

He told <strong>Kieran Gilbert</strong> on Sky:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If it was an ordinary administrative error, it would have happened sometime in the last century.

  "<p>Love them or hate them, the Sharknado films have been a hugely successful franchise (in fact, the fourth Sharknado film yes that\u2019s right, the fourth, aired on the Syfy channel at the end of July). I couldn\u2019t possibly comment on their value as films, but as a shark scientist I can say that they inspire in me a feeling of regret that I failed to coin the word \u2018sharknado\u2019. Because in fact, a good few years before the first Sharknado hit our screens in 2013, I was investigating how sharks responded to extreme weather events as part of my PhD.</p> <p>It is with some sadness however, that I can confirm that neither my colleagues nor I managed to conjure up such a gem as \u2018sharknado\u2019 in describing our findings. Pop culture regrets aside, how do sharks respond to extreme weather events? Well, it all comes down to pressure and how they sense it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2016/sep/29/sharks-fascinate-us-but-are-we-prepared-to-protect-them-from-extinction\">Sharks fascinate us - but are we prepared to protect them from extinction?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pressure serves as an important cue within the marine environment. Since water is 1,000 times denser than air, every 10m of depth adds approximately one bar of hydrostatic pressure. The ability of animals to sense this pressure provides them with a reliable way of sensing depth, and allows them to respond behaviourally to hydrostatic pressure changes; for example, synchronising their activity to tidal cycles or regulating depth. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5190226910e035153a7a718ab02201ba8419a8be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5190226910e035153a7a718ab02201ba8419a8be/16_0_3551_2131/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A small-spotted catshark.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A small-spotted catshark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Picasa/Lauren Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My work into shark depth utilisation began in the shark researcher\u2019s paradise that is South Bimini, Bahamas. I was stationed at the world renowned <a href=\"http://www.biminisharklab.com/home\">Bimini Sharklab</a>, founded by Dr Samuel H. Gruber. The shallow coastal waters of the Bimini islands serve as ideal nursery grounds for a number of shark species, most notably the lemon shark (<em>Negaprion brevirostris</em>). Prior to heading out to Bimini I had been discussing juvenile shark responses to changes in barometric pressure with Dr Michelle Heupel. In 2003 Heupel <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236445520_Variable_response_of_coastal_sharks_to_severe_tropical_storms_Environmental_cues_and_changes_in_space_use\">published a paper</a> on juvenile blacktip sharks that were observed to move to deeper water in response to a lowering of barometric pressure associated with the approach of Tropical Storm Gabrielle. </p> <p>Coincidentally, after only about a week of being in Bimini, Tropical Storm Ernesto was set to hit the islands (cue the Sharknado theme tune) and we were forced to evacuate back to Florida, but not before I had excitedly deployed one of my data storage tags (recording time, depth and temperature) on a shark! As it turned out, the storm weakened in its intensity on its approach to South Bimini. This meant changes in barometric pressure were minimal, and no evidence could be found of a change in the shark\u2019s depth usage in relation to the storm, let alone said shark being projected into a nearby city and battling a chainsaw-wielding hero\u2026 (Sharknado theme fades away).</p> <p>After tagging more juvenile sharks and retrieving more data than I could cope with - which ultimately revealed that the sharks spent the majority of their time occupying very shallow water depths of 0-0.1m, showed a <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diel\">diel rhythm</a> when diving to deeper depths and preferred an average water temperature of 30\u00b0C (who doesn\u2019t?!) - I decided to do further research into the behavioural responses of animals to changing weather systems. Previous studies conducted on <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/animal/teleost\">teleost fish</a> (adult white/black crappie, palmetto bass, red snapper and sauger) have shown that they alter their movement patterns and depth utilisation in response to changes in weather patterns, specifically barometric pressure (Markham et al. 1991; Guy et al. 1992; Jones and Rogers 1998; Watterson et al. 1998; Jeffrey and Edds 1999). </p> <p>However, the problem with trying to study an animal\u2019s response to changing pressure alone during a storm, is all of the other potentially confounding factors that make a storm a storm: heavy rainfall and subsequent run-off resulting in salinity changes, storm surges, wind and low frequency sound. And so, upon my return to Aberdeen and following a few discussions and meetings, I was able to eliminate all of these additional factors by being the first person to do the obvious thing and place a shark tank inside a hypobaric chamber.</p> <p>By doing this I was able to observe swimming activity of the small-spotted catshark (<em>Scyliorhinus canicula</em>) in response to specific protocols of changing pressure. The pressure utilised were well within the normal range that this species of shark would experience in the wild, given its habitat usage, with the largest change in pressure being just less than the equivalent of swimming at a depth of 11m. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2016/jan/19/tourism-with-bite-swimming-with-the-great-white-shark\">Tourism with bite: swimming with the great white shark</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Interestingly, most swimming activity was observed in relation to decreasing pressure, as opposed to increasing pressure, with the sharks responding within 10-20 seconds of the pressure change being initiated. Some of the behavioural responses observed were remarkable, with swimming activity seen after a pressure decrease of only 0.005 bar. The results suggested a very sensitive mechanism indeed, so I began to investigate the physiological aspects underpinning the ability to sense pressure. </p> <p>Previous work investigating how marine organisms without swim bladders sense pressure identified the vestibular system as a site for pressure sensing in the crab and shark (Fraser and Macdonald 1994; Fraser and Shelmerdine 2002; Fraser et al. 2003). This work suggested that the hair cell (thread hair cell in crabs) acts as a mechanoreceptor by converting minute displacements into behaviourally relevant receptor potentials, thereby providing the basis for vestibular function.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"890cfacfc3b5901f33db95e55d55895c86aa5f76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/890cfacfc3b5901f33db95e55d55895c86aa5f76/0_235_1707_1024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharks sporting data storage tags.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharks sporting data storage tags.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lauren Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Physiological recordings have shown that the shark pressure sensor is clearly capable of responding to increasing as well as decreasing pressure (Fraser and Shelmerdine 2002). Yet my behavioural experiments in the hypobaric chamber showed no significant swimming activity occurring during increasing pressure. Heupel et al (2003) speculated that the behaviour shown by the juvenile blacktip sharks in response to the approach of Tropical Storm Gabrielle may have been an innate response based upon the synchronicity of departures and the sharks\u2019 young age (3-4 months). With shark nursery grounds typically thought to provide protection from predation and abundance of food, Heupel suggested that leaving the nursery in response to unusual or irregular changes in hydrostatic pressure may be a mechanism to prevent individuals from being trapped in a shallow area during an extreme storm event. Alternatively, it could be due to a disorientation of the pressure sensing mechanism, driving the animals to seek deeper water, although when considering the relatively small pressure changes involved this seems unlikely. </p> <p>Based upon the evidence I collated for this part of my PhD, it was clear that the pressure sensing mechanism and how it translates into a behavioural response by the animal is complex. It seems reasonable to speculate that the use of the pressure sensor in the wild would provide sharks with continuous depth information and would serve as a primary stimulus for a fast-acting innate safety response: movement of sharks from shallow turbulent water to deeper water during a storm.</p> <p>In other words, I can also conclude that it would take a heck of a storm to result in a Sharknado!</p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>Heupel, M.R., Simpfendorfer, C.A., Hueter, R.E.

  "<p>Hungary\u2019s democracy is in mortal danger \u2013 and whether it survives will help determine the future of our embattled continent. This weekend the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/09/protests-in-hungary-at-closure-of-main-leftwing-opposition-newspaper\" title=\"\">main opposition newspaper \u2013 think of it as a Hungarian Guardian \u2013 was closed down by its owners after six decades of existence</a>. Its digital archive vanished from the internet; its workers were shut out of their offices and left <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/hidv-gi-b-attila-alexandra-barcea/hungary-shock-tactics-against-press-freedoms\" title=\"\">unable to access emails</a>.</p> <p>Publicly, it is presented as a commercial decision: in Hungary\u2019s increasingly repressive society, there is widespread private cynicism about such a claim. Here was a newspaper that dared to challenge the government \u2013 whether on policy, corruption, or its onslaught against democracy.</p> <p>Authoritarian rightwing populism is sweeping the western world: Hungary is an acute example. We all know history turned a corner after the 2008 financial crisis: we are beginning to see how sharp that turn was. From the Scottish independence movement to Podemos in Spain, from Donald Trump to France\u2019s National Front and Hungary\u2019s far right, from the rise of Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn to Greece\u2019s Syriza: a painful struggle for the west\u2019s future has only just begun. Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n \u2013 whose rightwing party swept to victory in 2010 \u2013 recognises this. His chief lesson from 2008 is that \u201cliberal democratic states can\u2019t remain globally competitive\u201d. He has committed his government to building an \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d \u2013 and he is <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-28/orban-says-he-seeks-to-end-liberal-democracy-in-hungary\" title=\"\">remaining true to his word</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rather than being repelled, a new generation is being attracted to rightwing extremism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Others have harsher descriptions. Hungarian dissident G\u00e1spar Mikl\u00f3s Tam\u00e1s <a href=\"http://arbetet.se/global/2015/09/26/gaspar-miklos-tamas-this-is-post-fascism/\" title=\"\">accuses the government</a> of \u201cpissing on the liberal status quo\u201d in favour of \u201cpost-fascism\u201d.</p> <p>Hungarian-British poet George Szirtes knows all about repression. His mother was a photographer, his father a senior ministry official, and they fled after the Soviet Union crushed Hungary\u2019s revolution in 1956. \u201cHungarian democracy is imperilled,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019re moving towards a Putinesque situation.\u201d As Human Right Watch\u2019s Lydia Gall puts it: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in the last six years is essentially a continued undermining or deterioration of the rule of law and human rights protection.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010 and 2011, Hungary adopted a series of laws which were <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.eu/content/assets/Doc2011/Freedom_of_Expression_Under_Fire_-_Hungarian_Media_Law.pdf\" title=\"\">damned by Amnesty International</a> as \u201ca threat to the right to freedom of expression\u201d. Hungary\u2019s media outlets had to register with a national authority. The Klubr\u00e1di\u00f3 station \u2013 a persistent critic of the government \u2013 became one of its victims. At the end of 2011, the authority decided not to grant Klubr\u00e1di\u00f3 a licence to broadcast, forcing it into a <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2012/01/eu-must-press-hungary-respect-human-rights-norms/\" title=\"\">protracted battle</a> \u2013 though the station did eventually win.</p> <p>This authoritarian government has repeatedly amended the constitution: one change embedded discrimination against LGBT people by <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2012/01/eu-must-press-hungary-respect-human-rights-norms/\" title=\"\">defining the family as a unit</a> \u201cbased on the marriage of a man and a woman, or a linear blood relationship, or guardianship. Indeed, earlier this year Hungary <a href=\"http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/03/08/hungary-blocks-european-agreement-on-lgbt-rights/\" title=\"\">blocked an EU-wide agreement</a> to prevent discrimination against LGBT people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e66053af214f9246176c9283fef5c0e8d8a46210\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e66053af214f9246176c9283fef5c0e8d8a46210/0_0_3460_2307/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Youngsters at a concert by nationalist band Romantic Violence, which followed a rally by far-right sympathisers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Youngsters at a concert by nationalist band Romantic Violence, which followed a rally by far-right sympathisers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vadim Ghirda/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/09/18/hungary-constitutional-change-falls-short\" title=\"\">Other amendments</a> have attacked judicial independence and religious freedoms. Key public institutions, such as the office of the prosecutor general and the constitutional court, have been de facto taken over by the ruling party. \u201cThese are institutions that should be independent checks and balances on the government,\u201d says Gall. There is a growing atmosphere of intolerance in the country, with those who dissent being denounced as traitors and accomplices of terrorism. Worse still, one of the main opposition parties is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/26/leader-hungarian-jobbik-rally-london\" title=\"\">Jobbik</a>, an antisemitic neo-fascist party&#xa0;with a paramilitary wing.</p> <p>Hungary\u2019s role in Europe\u2019s refugee crisis has been appalling, prompting Luxembourg\u2019s foreign minister to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/expel-hungary-from-eu-for-hostility-to-refugees-says-luxembourg\" title=\"\">propose the country\u2019s expulsion</a> for treating refugees \u201cworse than wild animals\u201d. Last year, the country declared&#xa0;a <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/hungary/report-hungary/\" title=\"\">state of crisis</a> and built a fence with the intention of driving refugees back into Serbia.

Hungary is, after all, dependent on economic assistance from the union. Article 7 of the EU constitution exists to sanction member states in violation of its norms, including the suspension of voting rights. The European commission has made it progressively harder to invoke, and last year the European parliament <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-eu-news-article-7-vote-poland-rule-of-law/\" title=\"\">threw out a proposal</a> to invoke Article 7 \u2013 or even to activate a warning mechanism.</p> <p>When Hungary\u2019s government imposed the mass early retirement of veteran judges in favour of more pliant replacements, the EU did take action \u2013 but only on the <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-1112_en.htm\" title=\"\">grounds of age discrimination</a>. Hungary was fined and forced to pay financial compensation to those sacked \u2013 but it still achieved its goal. A recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/the-question-was-stupid-hungarians-on-the-refugee-referendum\" title=\"\">government-initiated referendum to oppose EU plans to settle refugees</a> failed because of insufficient turnout, but it stirred up inflammatory xenophobic and racist rhetoric.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/hungarian-right-does-not-want-to-leave-the-eu-it-wants-to-subvert-it\">Hungarian right does not want to leave the EU. It wants to subvert it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hungary\u2019s plight has disturbing echoes of Europe\u2019s past: but, horrifyingly, it could foreshadow our future too. Rather than being repelled, a new generation \u2013 including the university-educated \u2013 are <a href=\"http://dailynewshungary.com/jobbik-is-the-most-popular-among-university-students/\" title=\"\">increasingly attracted to rightwing extremism</a>. Poland too is in the grip of an authoritarian right which chips away at the country\u2019s hard-won democracy. With no meaningful consequences, such governments feel increasingly emboldened. In Austria, the far right moves ever closer to power; in France, it grows stronger; in Sweden and other countries too.</p> <p>The cure to such movements is a left that offers an inspiring alternative relevant to the insecurities and ambitions of the post-2008 world. We don\u2019t have that yet. But that\u2019s no excuse for inaction. And we in Britain cannot smugly condemn Hungary, of course: since the Brexit vote, xenophobic nationalism has marched defiantly. Our prime minister condemns her political opponents as having disdain for patriotism; this week, both the Daily&#xa0;Mail and the Daily Express printed&#xa0;chilling front pages calling for \u201cunpatriotic Bremoaners\u201d to be damned for a \u201cplot to subvert the will of the British people\u201d, and demanding \u201cEU exit whingers\u201d be silenced.</p> <p>It is increasingly common in modern Europe for political opponents to be portrayed as unpatriotic fifth columnists. The history of our continent tells us where this can lead. Hungary is perhaps the most extreme, undiluted form of what Europe is becoming. It is a warning we should heed.</p>",
