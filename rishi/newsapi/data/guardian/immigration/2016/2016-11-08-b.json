The Republican-controlled legislatures efforts to introduce one of the strictest forms of photo-ID requirements in the country has led to widespread confusion, Perez said.</p> <p>The coalition has found numerous cases of signs being posted on the walls of polling stations that incorrectly inform voters about Texas\u2019 photo-ID criteria.</p> <p>Many complaints have come in about alleged intimidation of voters outside polling stations from a number of states. \u201cWe\u2019ve certainly heard from voters complaining about this, though it\u2019s going to be very hard to tell how organized it was. It\u2019s too early to tell whether it was an individual action or something more planned.\u201d</p> <p>One development that Perez said would have to be reviewed after the dust has settled from this election was the proliferation of poll watchers. The 2016 election cycle, given the degree of suspicion around, had spawned the surreal phenomenon of poll watchers observing voters and then poll monitors watching them.</p> <p>\u201cWe are creating a culture of multiple layers of people observing each other, which produces it\u2019s own challenges.

She was born in January 1920, months before the final state ratified the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment, which granted women the right to vote. Now, the 96-year-old, who immigrated to America from Russia as a child, is looking forward to voting for a woman herself. \u201cI\u2019ve hoped for a long time that this day would come,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Diamond is just one of many women born before the 19<sup>th</sup>Amendment profiled on the website <a href=\"http://iwaited96years.com/\">iwaited96years.com</a>: different women from different backgrounds sharing the same excitement about this historic moment. In a lifetime they\u2019ve gone from being disenfranchised because of their sex to casting a vote for, potentially, the first female President of the United States.</p> <p>There\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.iwaited96years.com/eugenia\">Eugenia Perkins</a>, 102, in North Carolina: \u201cIt is about time there was a woman President!\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.iwaited96years.com/lung-hsin\">Lung Hsin Wu</a>, 98, in Oregon, by way of Beijing: \u201cMy vote means another step towards equity for women!\u201d</p> <p>And there\u2019s Diamond, who says: \u201cSince as long as I can remember\u2026I don\u2019t want to be better than men. I want to be equal to them. You\u2019re a second-class citizen if you\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>Women\u2019s rights have progressed a lot in Diamond\u2019s lifetime, but there\u2019s still a way to go. \u201cWhen you hear the difference in salaries between men and woman for the same job and the men get more than you do\u2026\u201d she shakes her head. \u201cMaybe Hillary can help.\u201d</p> <p>Diamond has been doing as much campaigning as she can for Clinton. When her assisted living facility had early voting a couple of weeks ago she got a placard of Hillary made up \u201csat 50 feet away from the voting booth\u201d doing last minute electioneering.</p> <p>Diamond thinks the final result will be close. But whether Clinton wins or not, \u201cshe\u2019s opened the door for future women to think about running and that\u2019s important. I\u2019m sure there will be others, maybe not in my lifetime.

I was pleasantly surprised to only wait about 15 minutes in line, and I am so grateful for the friendly attitudes and efficiency of the volunteers. The voting process went smoothly, and regardless of how long anyone has to wait in line, I encourage you to vote. Quite frankly, there is too much at stake in this election. My girlfriend and I are going to order takeout and watch the election results tonight... Regardless of which candidate wins Missouri this year, I\u2019m proud to say I cast my ballot to promote a better political future for myself as a young adult, and a better future for all Americans.</p> <p><strong>Steve Pearcy from Manassas, Virginia says his mom would have liked to have seen today:</strong></p> <p>When my mom and dad were born, a woman couldn\u2019t vote in the US. A black man theoretically could vote, but his right to do so was usually denied, usually, alas, by Democrats in the south. Folks from poor backgrounds like my folks didn\u2019t really have much chance of going to college to change their lot in life. If someone without money got seriously ill, they usually died, like my grand-uncle\u2019s young wife and their two-year old child in the flu epidemic of 1918.</p> <p>A little over 40 years later when I was born, a woman could vote in the US. Barriers to black folk voting would be torn down a few years later with the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts, laws pushed through by more visionary Democrats. A few years later Medicare and Medicaid programs were enacted by Democrats so people without means had access to health care. A woman and man of different races could not marry in many states of the US. My father, who grew up on a tenant farm in Missouri, went to college after World War II with the GI Bill. My brother would go to college a few years after I was born, my mother would get her degree 14 years after I was born, and from an early age I just assumed I\u2019d go to college. As a kid, my grandmother used to say with pride, \u201cI\u2019m a Baptist and a Democrat,\u201d and my parents took me to vote and see them vote for Democrats because the Democratic party tried to help all people, not just the rich.</p> <p>A little over 40 years after I was born, I sat with my parents and cheered and cried as we watched as Barack Obama, the son of a white woman and a black man, was nominated to be the Democratic candidate for president. Unfortunately there were and still are folk who try to keep people of color from voting, but such efforts have the boom-a-rang effect of making people more determined to vote. More and more people in the United States are getting the chance to go to college. The Affordable Care Act enacted by Democrats provides access to health care to millions who did not have access before. People of all races can marry anyone who they wish. The country continues to try to be better with every generation, to try to be a more perfect union.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T21:25:46.074Z\">at 9.25pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58222cd2e4b0eda0192fd8a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sam-thielman\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T19:52:43.099Z\">7.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Trump cited voting machine malfunctions on CNN on Tuesday afternoon when he again refused to say whether he would concede the election if he lost.

One of them was tied to a broom stick with blue rope and had a very length message on the front. It mostly discussed Trump\u2019s mental health. People are actually allowed to go into Trump Tower, if they were prepared to brave the sanitation trucks, metal barricades, and police.

It\u2019s election day, but we\u2019ll resist the temptation to wax dramatic. No reflections on the historical import of a day that could see the election of the first woman US president, or of Donald Trump. No musing about just how long these last 18 months have sometimes felt. No solicitations after your personal health, mental and physical, at this, the (apparent) end of our collective slog through a muddy field of base discourse, objectionable behavior and trampled bunting.</p> <p>There were some happy moments in there! We think. And we will recall them just as soon as the votes are counted. Which brings us to the main business of the day: bringing you the election results, as soon as they come in, from Maine to Alaska. That\u2019s the purpose of today\u2019s blog, and that\u2019s what you can expect as the polls begin to close, initial returns come back, state results are declared and the identity of the 45th president of the United States is revealed.</p> <p>When will we know who was elected president? In 2000, they didn\u2019t know until December. But that was exceptional. With any luck tonight, we\u2019ll know the identity of the next president before the clock ticks into Wednesday on the east coast. The first polls opened in New Hampshire at midnight - with three tiny towns allowing midnight voting and immediate results. </p> <p>Out of the 64 ballots cast in those three counties, Trump nabbed 32 votes, Clinton got 25 and three went to Libertarian Gary Johnson.</p> <p>The last polls, in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, aren\u2019t due to close until 1am ET.

In some cases voters have been denied a ballot. The justice department announced Monday that it planned to deploy in 28 states to ensure voting rights were respected, after Trump\u2019s claims that the vote would be rigged and exhortation to supporters to keep a vigilant eye in \u201ccertain areas\u201d.<br></p> <p>We\u2019ll also have the chance to gauge whether turnout appears to be up or down in a way that bodes well for either candidate.

John Higgins at consultancy Capital Economics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A victory for Hillary Clinton in the presidential race was heavily discounted on the day of the vote. So we doubt that there will be much of a response in the markets today if she has triumphed. But a win for Donald Trump could cause major upheaval.</p> <p>For example, a victory for Trump would probably send the dollar down sharply against other \u201cmajors\u201d, particularly the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen. We would expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to break below 100, compared to a current level of nearly 105. We would also anticipate a sharp rise in the dollar against some emerging market currencies. For example, the Mexican peso could hit 25/$, versus 19/$ or so now.</p> <p>In our view, a Trump win would also have large effects on equities. For example, we think the S&amp;P 500 would fall below 2,000, compared to a current level of around 2,130. And many stock market indices elsewhere would probably fare worse. The Nikkei 225 could be hit especially hard by accompanying strength in the yen \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it tumbled below 15,000, versus a current level of more than 17,000. And there would probably a broad-based rout in emerging markets.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a93ec2b8167d4198cafd8cfd932aa8bbbd8d631\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a93ec2b8167d4198cafd8cfd932aa8bbbd8d631/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the US votes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the US votes</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>We suspect that US Treasuries would rally if Trump won, with the 10-year yield falling to 1.5% from around 1.8%. Admittedly, he has talked about defaulting on the national debt, has a fiscal plan that includes unfunded tax cuts and has proposed trade tariffs that would boost inflation. But a plunge in risky asset prices would prompt a reassessment of the near-term outlook for Fed policy and boost the demand for safe havens.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the initial uncertainty following a victory for Trump would surely undermine the prices of industrial commodities, including oil and base metals, while gold would benefit from a renewed burst of safe-haven demand. In the short term, therefore, we would expect crude oil to fall to around $40 and gold to surge to at least $1,400. The impact of the dollar is a further wildcard. A big fall in the value of the US currency would limit the downside for the dollar prices of industrial commodities, while adding to the upside for gold. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5821ee7ae4b029b92ca46a78\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T15:31:34.879Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the presidential election, and if Hillary Clinton wins, it would give a green light to the Federal Reserve to raise US interest rates in December, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets have rushed to price in a rate hike from the Fed in recent days, the current implied probability of one 25 basis point hike next month is 82%, up from 68% a week ago.

There is nothing constructive to be said today on the political noise, so perhaps we should look to the challenges ahead.</li> <li>Prejudice is one of the biggest threats to economic and social stability. Prejudice is on the rise. Declaring a group in society to be \u201csecond class\u201d undermines their economic contribution \u2013 increasingly so in today\u2019s changing world. Politicians must tackle prejudice head-on; it is morally and economically the right thing to do.<br></li> <li>Global trade patterns are changing. Lengthening supply chains and outsourcing are outdated as localized production reintroduces the imperial trade model, and technology means that trade in services is increasingly important. Politicians need to stop living the trade of the past, and embrace the trade of the future.<br></li> <li>Jobs do not disappear; jobs become different.

  "<p>On Sunday, the capital city of one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies was effectively shut down in an emergency act. The reason was not terrorism, but air pollution. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/06/delhi-air-pollution-closes-schools-for-three-days\" title=\"\">threat to citizens from smog in Delhi</a> was judged so great that traffic was ratioined, coal-fired power stations closed and diesel generators suspended. This was a&#xa0;brave and sane decision in the world\u2019s largest democracy.</p> <p>Right now Delhi is the world\u2019s most polluted city. But air quality is at crisis levels in cities around the world. More than <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/media/media_92979.html\" title=\"\">300 million children live at the severest risk, Unicef declared last week</a>, and 2 billion in areas where outdoor pollution exceeds health guidelines. Half of Delhi\u2019s schoolchildren have permanently impaired lung capacity, thanks to the air they breathe.</p> <p>India\u2019s capital city is telling people to stay away or work from home, but offering no compensation to those who cannot, or whose livelihood suffers. This can only be a short-term solution; it hurts those who can least bear it. Although the prime minister Theresa May will have been sheltered from the worst of the choking smog <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/07/theresa-may-visa-offer-india-citizens-uk\" title=\"\">during her trip to India</a>, arriving in Delhi should have been a powerful warning about the effects of privileging growth over environmental concerns. Citizens of rich countries are sometimes too relaxed about such things when air pollution afflicts the richest cities as well as the poorest. That&#xa0;London has not yet been closed down in&#xa0;similar fashion to Delhi is only through lack&#xa0;of&#xa0;courage on the part of the government.</p> <p>Air quality in London has hit levels worse than those in Delhi and Beijing. Earlier this year, annual air pollution limits were breached in just a week. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/02/high-court-rules-uk-government-plans-to-tackle-air-pollution-are-illegal\" title=\"\">Earlier this month, in&#xa0;what may be one of the last chances to bring EU law to bear on the issue, the high court ruled that the government had knowingly failed to draw up plans to bring it within legal limits</a> and there must be immediate action, even if that means drastic measures to curtail traffic.</p> <p>The causes of air pollution differ around the world, from coal-fired power plants to agricultural burning. One constant is traffic. Older cars and diesel engines produce particulates that clog up the lungs and may enter brain tissue, and nitrogen oxides that affect breathing. Car manufacturers were forced to admit last year that they had flouted tests on their diesel emissions. But the bigger question is why in a shortsighted attempt to reduce greenhouse gases by a tiny amount (diesel cars do more miles to the gallon) the risks were ignored, and customers persuaded that diesel cars were actually greener.</p> <p>Now that the consequences for air quality are clear, it is time to rebalance taxation and regulation in favour of petrol, which is cleaner though producing more carbon, and urgently incentivise electric cars. In London Sadiq Khan, the new mayor, to his credit has taken a strong line on air pollution, in contrast to Boris Johnson\u2019s tactics which amounted to unconvincing denial and attempts to silence scientists. Mr Khan should move faster still on banning the most polluting vehicles \u2013 he would find public support in inner London.</p> <p>Air pollution shames us all. From Beijing to Los Angeles, <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.fr/20160621/pollution-in-france-kills-48000-people-each-year\" title=\"\">Marseille</a> to Manila, the air we breathe in cities has deteriorated so much that it is no longer safe for children. Adults who grew up breathing cleaner air are more resilient in the face of polution. But when a child\u2019s lungs are damaged, they are damaged for life. The next generation already carries the burden of our inaction. This is a problem we know how to solve. Cut down coal-fired power, cut out diesel in cities, encourage electric cars and public transport. India should follow the declaration of emergency with long-term action, not just this short-term fix. Richer cities, London foremost among them, should be ashamed that they, with all their resources, have failed their children for so long. The high court judges were right. The&#xa0;government can and must act&#xa0;now.</p>",
  "<p>The Home Office has been refused planning permission to build a rapid removal centre for asylum seekers near Glasgow airport after almost 300 objections were lodged with the local council.</p> <p>The planning application was overwhelmingly rejected by Renfrewshire council\u2019s planning board on Tuesday afternoon.</p> <p>Local politicians and campaigners had criticised plans for the new short-term facility to replace Dungavel immigration removal centre in Lanarkshire, raising concerns that vulnerable asylum seekers risked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/29/asylum-seekers-in-scotland-at-risk-of-being-funnelled-out-of-country\">being funnelled out of Scotland</a> and away from family, friends and legal representation. </p> <p>Robert Goodwill, the immigration minister, said at the beginning of September that Dungavel, which has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/08/dungavel-immigration-detention-centre-will-close-says-minister\">condemned as \u201cbarbaric and inhumane\u201d</a> and been the focus of numerous protests, will shut late next year. </p> <p>Kenny MacLaren, the deputy leader of Renfrewshire council\u2019s Scottish National party group and one of the local councillors for the proposed location of the new centre, told the Guardian there had been unanimous and cross-party opposition to the application. </p> <p>He said: \u201cThere were clear planning grounds to reject this application, never mind the moral case for rejecting this application.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA full list of objections will be prepared and given to the applicant including the negative economic impact this proposal would have on the airport and surrounding area. There was also no specific need for this site to be used as claimed by the applicant. Detainees weren\u2019t to be frogmarched to the airport, so vans or buses would be used, meaning that any site could be used.\u201d</p> <p>MacLaren, who had a number of constituents approach him with their concerns about the facility, said a total of 297 objections had been lodged by a combination of local residents and campaigning organisations such as <a href=\"http://www.paih.org/\">Positive Action in Housing</a>, an independent homelessness charity that supports people from refugee and migrant backgrounds.<br></p> <p>The Home Office can consider the reasons for refusal and appeal to the Scottish government, if it chooses to. </p> <p>A spokesperson said the department was \u201cconsidering our next steps\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe are disappointed by the decision of the planning committee. A new short-term holding facility in Scotland would provide a modern and secure facility for those with no right to be in the UK and would allow for the closure of Dungavel immigration removal centre,\u201d the spokesperson said. </p> <p>As the Home Office sought to build the short-term airport facility, where individuals could only be held for a limited period, groups including the Scottish Refugee Council, Amnesty International and Detention Action said they were worried it would result in asylum detainees being taken away from their support networks.</p> <p>There is no long-term centre north of Lincolnshire, so those removed from Scotland will be a number of hours\u2019 drive away from friends and family. They will also face jurisdictional difficulties as they find themselves under a different legal system. This means they may need to abandon any pending legal challenges in the Scottish courts and find new representation in England.</p> <p>Kate Alexander, the director of the charity <a href=\"http://sdv.org.uk/\">Scottish Detainee Visitors</a>, has previously told the Guardian there is little evidence to show that short-term facilities led to people being removed more quickly. The most recent figures for Larne House, Northern Ireland\u2019s short-term holding facility, showed 44% of inmates were moved to another detention centre.<br></p> <p>She added that, in contrast with longer-term facilities, short-term units operated with no equivalent rules regarding the protection of inmates, resulting in concerns about conditions and, in particular, the treatment of women.</p>",

Removing \u201cillegals\u201d from central America and banning immigration from any Muslim country can only amount to a program of racial cleansing in a country with the ethnic diversity of the US. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s swipes against Black Lives Matter and his raging about \u201cvoter fraud\u201d are coded appeals to a sense among some of his supporters that African Americans should be returned to the margins of the country\u2019s life. </p> <p>Australians like to look down on the spectacle and extremism of US politics but the fact is that our respective histories have strong parallels. Each was founded on forms of white nationalism, which bubble up in political life and everyday conversation. </p> <p>The white settlers of both countries dispossessed and slaughtered their native inhabitants. Later, each heavily restricted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Australia_policy\">non-white migration</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act\">especially from Asia</a>. </p> <p>White advantages (and white racism) have never disappeared in either country. But a more diverse migrant intake from the latter part of the 20th century has factored into complex politics of backlash and resentment. </p> <p>At first this was given expression by flash-in-the-pan demagogues in the 1990s, like One Nation here or David Duke in the US. Now, cynical conservatives have brought it into the heart of the political process in Australia, the US and other western democracies. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/08/in-the-game-of-fantasy-us-election-one-fifth-of-australians-would-vote-for-tru\">In the game of Fantasy US Election, one-fifth of Australians would vote for Trump | Peter Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When we look at Bernardi and Christensen\u2019s most prominent activities \u2013 halal food inquiries, 18C, or <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-19/george-christensen-addresses-extreme-islam-at-mackay-rally/6632006\">palling around with Reclaim Australia</a> \u2013 we see that they too embrace a politics that centres around white identity, and portrays its privileges as being at risk from threatening ethnic and cultural others. </p> <p>Their Trump support is, no doubt, partly about trolling for attention. </p> <p>But we are best to take it at face value.

What costs are you prepared to pay?\u2019 I\u2019ve been very clear about what\u2019s needed to be achieved.\u201d<br></p> <p>What CA are working to achieve, he says, is for cricket to become inclusive of all Australians. \u201cIf you believe in equality and respect and inclusion, you apply that across all human beings, irrespective of gender, race, sexuality, culture or background,\u201d says Almaliki. \u201cThat\u2019s been so important for cricket.\u201d</p> <p>On that front, CA have actually started walking the talk in Almaliki\u2019s time, having recently integrated their disability teams into the Australian cricket pathway system, ending the era of players paying their own way, while fully professionalising the game for the Southern Stars women\u2019s team and making great strides in the same direction at domestic level, where even the AFL\u2019s new women\u2019s league, to name one, lags in terms of player payments.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s getting on the bandwagon of female engagement, and that is great, but there is a massive gap between their passion for what is fashionable and what is right,\u201d Almaliki notes. \u201cWe can\u2019t be selective about equality and respect.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the sports industry at the moment is that too many people are trying to out-do each other in the context of what is in fashion rather than what is right and what makes sense on a business and a social front. Being a sport for all Australians is fundamental to cricket\u2019s viability.\u201d</p> <p>Which is a decent place to point out the commercial reality faced by cricket: it actually must appeal to a broader array of Australians, particularly the women it long ignored, in order to remain financially viable. </p> <p>To that end, it\u2019s also been Almaliki\u2019s task to increase cricket participation amongst under-represented communities the game\u2019s administrators so often neglected, and he believes participation is the key to the entire \u201ccricket economy\u201d. If it\u2019s not strong, the knock-on effects are significant. </p> <p>On Almaliki\u2019s watch, for instance, Indigenous participation has risen at a national level from 8,500 to 36,000. \u201cAutomatically, as a result, if we keep at it we\u2019re going to see kids rise through,\u201d he says of the challenge to produce more professional players of Indigenous backgrounds. \u201cThey\u2019re going to feel more comfortable to be proud of their Indigenous heritage through cricket.\u201d<br></p> <p>It also makes Almaliki and CA more focused in their attempt to commemorate 1866 Indigenous team during this year\u2019s Boxing Day Test, which will feature 150th anniversary celebrations of the trailblazing side that toured England and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/tom-wills-grave-restoration-project-reveals-footballs-heart-soul-and-history\">the contribution of Tom Wills</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you haven\u2019t got a culture of inclusion you forget these stories,\u201d Almaliki says. \u201cThe game has developed a conscience it didn\u2019t have for much of its existence, and therefore we didn\u2019t tell the stories of 1866 as well as we should have, or the story of Faith Thomas, the first Indigenous woman to play a Test for Australia.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou only pursue the possibilities you\u2019re aware of, and how many Indigenous young people are aware of the possibility of playing cricket? Where are the role models and the heroes that provide clear visibility of that kind of possibility? When you demonstrate possibilities you inspire dreams, and that\u2019s where the game is getting to with the likes of Ashleigh Gardner and Dan Christian.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1be6aad6ee8e496f4d4837febc839fd7e17d52ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1be6aad6ee8e496f4d4837febc839fd7e17d52ba/0_0_4469_2975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cricket Australia head of community engagement Sam Almaliki\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cricket Australia head of community engagement Sam Almaliki says cricket has been central to his identity as a migrant Australian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Walmsley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Almaliki was eight years old when he, his parents and two brothers arrived in Australia on fake passports provided by people smugglers. Then, in 1997, an Iraqi family like the Almalikis could still come by plane. They came via Thailand, and were fleeing persecution they\u2019d faced under the regime of Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>A few hours after landing in Sydney, before linking up with his father and eldest brother, Almaliki, his mother and middle brother declared asylum, setting the wheels in motion for a trying eight-month period of detention in Villawood.</p> <p>Almaliki\u2019s father, Khalaf, had been a political scientist before they fled, a job that played a major role in the family\u2019s decision to leave. \u201cHe was under constant surveillance and monitoring,\u201d Almaliki says. \u201cHe had one of his brothers and four of his cousins killed by the government. My two older teenage brothers were facing the prospect of conscription, so the situation was pretty bad.\u201d </p> <p>At Villawood Almaliki learned English from scratch and so quickly that within three months he was acting as an interpreter to the Arabic-speaking detainees, working alongside a legal aid barrister and developing an early passion for advocacy and the law. He didn\u2019t realise the significance at the time, but Villawood was also where he glimpsed cricket for the first time, watching Tamil asylum seekers play spirited games.</p> <p>Otherwise it was a traumatic period for the family. Almaliki\u2019s father suffered what were later revealed to be two heart attacks, for which he received no medical treatment. Worse for the families\u2019 nerves were the constant announcements over speakers in the cramped detention centre. So often was their name called, and so frequent were the rejections of their claim, that every time a voice came through the PA system they stood and prepared themselves, anticipating some new indignity. \u201cIt was this constant anxiety and panic,\u201d Almaliki says.</p> <p>Thankfully their final appeal, to then federal immigration minister Phillip Ruddock, was upheld, but relief was tempered by a serious heart operation to Almaliki\u2019s father in the months following and the harsh adjustment to their new life in Australia. Almaliki\u2019s mother Najat, a university academic, had to take work in a sweet shop and the family moved into the first of eight homes they\u2019ve lived in since migrating. </p> <p>Before that, even negotiating the local shopping centre in Campsie presented challenges. \u201cWe were so exhausted after a hundred metres because we hadn\u2019t walked that distance in eight months,\u201d Almaliki says. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s a feeling that many prisoners have.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was a character-defining period. And I think it\u2019s really made me dogged. I struggle with \u2018no\u2019 as an answer and always believe there\u2019s a way. Sometimes that\u2019s hopeful and optimistic, at other times it\u2019s naive.\u201d </p> <p>Perhaps naivety helped. How else to explain Almaliki\u2019s path from the \u201cESL\u201d kid at Punchbowl Primary school to the executive suites of Australia\u2019s national game? He says a teacher named Rowan Hall was the first in a long line of \u201ccricket people\u201d who sparked something in the youngster though the sport. \u201cVillawood gave me visibility of cricket,\u201d Almaliki says, \u201che inspired my interest in the game.\u201d </p> <p>Like all child refugees, he says he had to grow up fast, developing persistence, resilience and independence. \u201cI see very few young people of refugee background who don\u2019t inspire me to be a better person,\u201d he says. \u201cThe necessities of life see you develop in ways you otherwise wouldn\u2019t seek to.\u201d</p> <p>In this case, it was cricket that offered social mobility and a window of opportunity. Stubborn and independent, Almaliki walked by himself from the family\u2019s public housing estate to a registration trial of the local Beverley Hills Eagles Cricket Club, winning a premiership in his first year with the Under-14s, bowling leg spin. \u201cYou can\u2019t have that much life and not be a leggie,\u201d Almaliki jokes. \u201cUnfortunately I had the wrong temperament for a leggie. I had a fast bowler\u2019s temperament. I wanted to get batsmen out every ball.\u201d</p> <p>Within a few years some of the coaches and administrators he came across as a player were effectively Almaliki\u2019s underlings when he decided that Sydney needed a winter competition and started his own; three teams to start with but eventually 96 and recognition from state cricket officials who\u2019d snubbed him to start with. </p> <p>\u201cThen and there at 15, it was clear to me that my career as a cricketer was never going to go far,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there was a potential to become an administrator and get involved in the game that way.\u201d </p> <p>One criticism CA often face is that their leadership ranks are filled with people who have no feel for cricket, nor the people who play and administer it at grassroots level. Almaliki says that you can\u2019t always match up the professional requirements of high level administrative roles with a burning individual passion for the game, a knowledge gap that perhaps explains his own rise.</p> <p>\u201cI seek to continue to be not too far removed from the people who make cricket happen, day-in, day-out,\u201d he says. \u201cWe administer cricket on their behalf, rather than the other way around.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97292bdc37998be8fd4ae0e30bfc97ca743fa9ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97292bdc37998be8fd4ae0e30bfc97ca743fa9ee/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Usman Khawaja\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Role models such as Usman Khawaja are vital for the growth of cricket in Australia, says Almaliki.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Carson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s also important for the Australian game is the diversity of the current playing ranks at national and domestic level. \u201cUsman Khawaja is a classic example,\u201d Almaliki says. \u201cHe\u2019s a licensed pilot, he\u2019s finished university. He\u2019s batting at number three for Australia and he\u2019s captaining Queensland, one of the most parochial states when it comes to issues of multiculturalism, yet its cricket skipper is the first cricketer of Islamic faith to play for Australia. It goes to show that you can find a way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFundamentally it\u2019s about role models if we\u2019re really going to get people to believe that they can play for Australia, in either our women\u2019s or men\u2019s side. It\u2019s so important in allowing young people of all backgrounds to see themselves in the mirror, to see heroes they can relate to.\u201d</p> <p>When we return to the framing of the refugee debate in Australia, Almaliki says that \u201ccommon sense gets lost in the extremes,\u201d though adds that his own political aspirations are \u201cnon-existent\u201d. He can make greater societal impact through sport and business, he thinks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/sep/14/football-and-refugees-in-australia-the-important-role-the-game-can-still-play\">Football and refugees in Australia: the important role the game can still play</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI find on an individual level that most Australians are compassionate and fair,\u201d Almaliki says.

She will have to get used to it.</p> <p>EU leaders are planning a meeting in December to discuss Brexit without the British prime minister, the Guardian has learnt.</p> <p>Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, wants the EU\u2019s 27 remaining member states to discuss Brexit around the time of an EU summit scheduled for 15-16 December, according to two Brussels sources.</p> <p>The British prime minister would attend the EU summit, but would not be invited to separate Brexit talks, the third time the UK has been excluded from leaders\u2019 talks since it joined the bloc in 1973. EU leaders met without David Cameron soon after the Brexit vote and held the summit in Slovakia without Theresa May in September.</p> <p>The meeting is a sign the EU27 are intensifying preparations on Britain\u2019s EU exit ahead of article 50, which May has promised to trigger by the end of March.</p> <p>Once the UK fires the starting gun on talks, the EU will spend four to eight weeks drawing up detailed guidelines for negotiations, a list of red lines that could cover everything from the single market to the status of Gibraltar.</p> <p>That work hasn\u2019t started yet, but Tusk wants to start preparing the ground. One senior EU diplomat told the Guardian the guidelines would be a trade off between speed and precision: \u201cif the guidelines remain flexible they are easier to adopt, if they are very detailed, they are likely to take more time.\u201d</p> <p>Brussels diplomats are keenly following Brexit fallout in the UK.

He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are those who have deliberately chosen to misrepresent the facts to challenge the independence of the judiciary, one of the cornerstones of our democratic parliamentary system. The reporting of this judgment in some newspapers was frankly a disgrace and an insult to the good name of journalism.</p> <p>The democratic structure of the UK and indeed this assembly is built on a foundation of the rule of law and the independence of our judicial system. The tragic recent history of Europe is littered with examples of countries that overthrew the rule of law and undermined the independence of the courts. That road is not a democratic one and leads only in one direction. I would hope those who may have made comments and statements in haste, will want to reflect.</p> </blockquote> <p>Explaining to the assembly in Cardiff why he wants to appear in person at the supreme court hearing, Antoniw said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I consider that this case raises issues of profound importance not only in relation to the concept of parliamentary sovereignty but also in relation to the wider constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom and the legal framework for devolution.</p> <p>I think it is of paramount importance to emphasise at this point that despite the political furore surrounding it and the frankly alarming tone of much of the press coverage, as the high court itself said, this case involves a pure question of law. It is not concerned with the merits and demerits of leaving the European Union and the politics surrounding that.</p> <p>The sole legal question at issue is whether the UK Government can as a matter of constitutional law use the prerogative powers to give notice of withdrawal from the European Union. In seeking to intervene in any appeal, the Welsh government will seek to reinforce the importance of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law: core, established principles of British constitutional law.</p> </blockquote> <p>Antoniw emphasised that the Welsh government was not seeking to reverse the result of the referendum. He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having outlined what the case is about I should also make a comment on what it is not about. The first minister has made crystal clear and I repeat that sentiment now: the Welsh government respects the result of the referendum and this is absolutely not about overturning that decision.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5821fae1e4b07ceadb3a39c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T16:23:28.701Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The legal commentator <strong>Joshua Rozenberg </strong>has posted a good story <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JoshuaRozenbergQC/posts/222545208167403\">on his Facebook page.</a> He says that Liz Truss, the lord chancellor and justice secretary, is being sued by six high court judges for age discrimination.

Both were rolling targets that did not involve balancing the budget in a given year, but setting plans that involved balancing the current budget over a five-year, and then later a three-year, timetable. That may sound like cheating, but the IFS commends this approach.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Only two targets managed to be met consistently: that is the coalition government\u2019s initial target to aim for a cyclically-adjusted balance on the current budget five years out and its subsequent revised target to aim to achieve this three years out. It is perhaps not a coincidence that these two targets also had much to commend them. In contrast the other targets either had more thresholds that were more arbitrary (\u201cwhen did the cycle start and end?\u201d, \u201cwhy 40% of GDP?\u201d, \u201cwhy should debt definitely fall between two future points in time?\u201d, \u201cwhy should welfare spending definitely be below some fixed level?\u201d) and/or were not sufficiently flexible in the face of adverse fiscal shocks (\u201cwhy must there be an overall surplus in 2019\u201320?\u201d, \u201cwhy must borrowing in 2013\u201314 be no more than half what it was in 2009\u201310?\u201d). The weaknesses of these other targets often meant that their abandonment was preferable than trying slavishly to adhere to them. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5821f373e4b029b92ca46a93\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T15:56:12.758Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some more pictures from Theresa May\u2019s India tour today.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09d176b3adef39ae79e585ec2987b24bec5ccc00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09d176b3adef39ae79e585ec2987b24bec5ccc00/0_94_3390_2035/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May stands amidst Hindu priests after offering prayers to the Hindu deity Lord Shiva during a visit to Someshwara Temple in Bangalore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May stands amidst Hindu priests after offering prayers to the Hindu deity Lord Shiva during a visit to Someshwara Temple in Bangalore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manjunath Kiran/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"251caa6fb2448a24d14bdb9d5a5a440c5be45572\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/251caa6fb2448a24d14bdb9d5a5a440c5be45572/0_240_4716_2829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May at the Sri Someshwara Temple.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May at the Sri Someshwara Temple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"218aad3cbba35767c27daa88731119c5ca0ceda1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/218aad3cbba35767c27daa88731119c5ca0ceda1/0_240_4507_2705/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May at the Sri Someshwara Temple.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May at the Sri Someshwara Temple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a8fddb7a9257352c02f8eb4a75fbc86dcc47256\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a8fddb7a9257352c02f8eb4a75fbc86dcc47256/0_0_3092_5184/596.jpg\" alt=\"Hindu priests brief British Prime Minister Theresa May, center, during her visit to Someshwara.\" width=\"596\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hindu priests brief British Prime Minister Theresa May, center, during her visit to Someshwara.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aijaz Rahi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And this is what Number 10 said about the visit in a briefing note sent out in advance.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister will visit the Sri Someshwara Temple in the Ulsoor District of Bengaluru later today to pay her respects at this ancient Hindu place of worship.</p> <p>She will be welcomed by a guard of honour consisting of garlanders (who place a garland of fragrant flowers around the neck) and musicians playing drums and horns. </p> <p>She will then tour the temple, built by the Chola dynasty (300 BCE\u20131279 CE) and showcasing an impressive mixture of Chola, Hoysala and Vijayanagar architecture.</p> <p>Someshwara means \u201che who wears the moon on his head\u201d, and is another name for Lord Shiva, one of the principal deities in the Hindu triumvirate.</p> <p>The prime minister will conclude her visit by participating in a Hindu Aarti (blessing).

So we should all give a lot of thought to that when you\u2019re talking to your friends and neighbours and trying to influence them. The first thing this election is about is how to restore broad-based prosperity and growth to the American economy. And I hope in the next presidential debate she and Senator Sanders and the others will be able to talk about what the best way to do that is. Hillary says that you have to have a campaign that appeals to the struggling, the striving and the successful. We have to do this together. And Bernie says just go get the money from the millionaires. And it sounds good because there\u2019s \u2013 to a lot of people, if you look all over the world \u2013 the British Labor Party disposed of its most (inaudible) leader, David Miliband, because they were mad at him for being part of Tony Blair\u2019s government in the Iraq War. And they moved to the left and put his brother in as leader because the British labor movement wanted it. When David Cameron thumped him in the election, they reached the interesting conclusion that they lost because they hadn\u2019t moved far left enough, and so they went out and practically got a guy off the street to be the leader of the British Labor Party, who I saw in the press today said that he was really a British citizen and had real British (inaudible). (Laughter.) </p> <p>But what that is reflective of \u2013 the same thing happened in the Greek election \u2013 when people feel they\u2019ve been shafted and they don\u2019t expect anything to happen anyway, they just want the maddest person in the room to represent them. And that is perfectly psychologically understandable and predictable. Most people in America haven\u2019t had a raise in 15 years. 86 percent of the American people, adjusted for inflation, have an income today lower than it was the day before the crash. The median income of American families, adjusted for inflation, is lower than it was the day I left office. </p> <p>So this election, first of all, should be: how do we restore broad-based prosperity? We\u2019ve only had one period in 50 years, since the early 1960s, when all segments of the American economy grew together, and that was the eight years when I served. You have to work at that. It is not an accident. That\u2019s a matter of policy. It really does matter what you do. And I\u2019m really proud of the fact that we moved 100 times as many people out of poverty into the middle class through work as happened in the Reagan years. You had 16 million jobs almost; we had almost 23 million. But the most important thing was 100 times as many people moved into the middle class. That\u2019s policy. It\u2019s policy that led the bottom 20 percent of workers to increase their income in percentage terms as much as the top 5 percent. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5821cbe3e4b0d073c27d292e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/libbybrooks\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T13:02:51.137Z\">1.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sturgeon says Scottish government wants to join article 50 case to oppose UK government</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> has confirmed that the Scottish government will intervene in the article 50 legal case as the UK government prepares to appeal the decision at the supreme court.</p> <p>At a regular press briefing held at Bute House in Edinburgh, Sturgeon confirmed that the Lord Advocate will lodge a formal application to intervene in the UK government\u2019s supreme court appeal against last week\u2019s high court ruling that Theresa May\u2019s government must seek the permission of the Commons before it can trigger article 50 and begin the process of leaving the EU.</p> <p>The Lord Advocate \u2013 Scotland\u2019s most senior law officer \u2013 will lodge the application as soon as the UK government lodges its own appeal.</p> <p>Sturgeon added that the Scottish parliament should also be formally consulted on the decision.

Here is an extract from its conclusion.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Another reason for the chancellor to wait before implementing any further fiscal tightening is that there is even more economic uncertainty than usual. But building a plan for further austerity in the next parliament would be prudent. Indeed even if a balanced headline budget was delivered in 2020\u201321 and then maintained thereafter public sector net debt would not be on course to reach its pre-crisis level of 40% of national income until around the mid-2040s. Unfortunately if anything the \u00a325 billion estimated deterioration in the public finances in 2019\u201320 is likely to understate the increase in the longer-term challenge that has occurred since the March Budget. The OBR\u2019s previous long-run projections were based on an optimistic assumption about NHS productivity growth which they have recently said is likely to be revised down in their future projections. More fundamentally any reduction in future immigration, any reduction in longer-term growth or any increase in future interest rates would make the fiscal arithmetic harder still. </p> </blockquote> <p>This morning Nick Gibb, the education minister, and Lord O\u2019Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, are both giving evidence to select committees.

Yet almost everyone assumed Clinton would be squaring off against one of a pack of Republican politicians.</p> <p>It was hard to conceive that she might stumble on her way to this feminist showdown thanks to Bernie Sanders, a self-described socialist who nearly upended the Democratic party primary. Even more implausibly, Donald Trump, a television reality show host and property developer who was neither a politician nor, arguably, a Republican, would sweep all of his primary election rivals aside in a landslide.

But it was his fondness for authoritarianism and flair for demagoguery that led most to unflattering comparisons with the political landscape of the 1930s. Who could have guessed that with some deft mutations for the media age, this virus would come so close to overwhelming the world\u2019s most powerful democracy in the 21st century?

This unlikeliest of public servants began his political life as the anti-Obama candidate, seeking to ride the swinging pendulum away from a high point in racial equality and shifting into opposition to the equivalent moment in women\u2019s emancipation.</p> <p>It was a crowded field. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush was long seen as the Republican frontrunner and raised more money within weeks than his self-described billionaire opponent was ever to contribute to the presidential campaign. Yet Bush was to flop disastrously at the first brush with actual voters. His measly three delegates in the Republican primary election \u2013 0.2% of the total needed to secure the nomination \u2013 were to cost $50m a piece. Fifteen other candidates copied his ignominious exit from a one-sided Republican primary that felt like an election all of its own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e544c32e1e00112248a54e2042b7604b8fc87526\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e544c32e1e00112248a54e2042b7604b8fc87526/0_0_620_372/500.jpg\" alt=\"Eight of the Republican candidates \u2013 not even half the field.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eight of the Republican candidates \u2013 not even half the field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images and Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite failing against Barack Obama in 2008, Clinton\u2019s coronation as the Democratic nominee looked so preordained that some worried whether the party would ever find a serious candidate to run against her in the primary at all. Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren was petitioned by many on the left and resisted. Sanders, an independent Vermont senator, stepped forward instead \u2013 at first with little hope of winning much beyond his home state, but determined there should at least be a debate about a more progressive alternative to the centrism traditionally associated with the Clinton family.</p> <p>The 74-year-old was to win 22 states and ride a tidal wave of enthusiasm rarely seen in politics. Fueled by anger over economic inequality and corruption, this gruff outsider came close several times to achieving enough momentum to pull off a victory that would have made Trump\u2019s nomination look tame. Like the reeling Republicans, the Democratic party too was convulsed by a wave of populism it first seemed ill-equipped to recognise, let alone respond to.</p> <p>Though a generation of young white supporters \u201cfelt the Bern\u201d, his campaign nonetheless never reached escape velocity. Quite apart from its shocking radicalism (at least by modern American standards), it was held back by a lack of early media coverage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/02/bernie-sanders-revolution-white-african-american-voters\">limited support among African American voters</a> in the south and determined resistance from the party hierarchy. Despite conspiracy theories to the contrary, Clinton was to win nationally by a clear and convincing majority.</p> <p>But the long, and sometimes bitter, Democratic primary showed its eventual nominee\u2019s vulnerabilities just as much as it also helped shift her manifesto to the left in ways even Sanders could once only dream of. Most of all, it demonstrated the country\u2019s desire for change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/07/the-guardian-view-on-americas-choice-dont-vote-for-trump-elect-clinton\">The Guardian view on America\u2019s choice: Don\u2019t vote for Trump.

The highlights instead were the moments when it became apparent America had left the railing and was heading off into some entirely new and uncharted territory.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tjPZvxwgEk\">first descended the golden escalator</a> of his Manhattan skyscraper into a flock of reporters hungry for excitement.

An excited press pack chased her across the plains of Iowa in a bus they dubbed the \u201cScooby van\u201d, only to discover a tightly disciplined campaign nothing like the cartoon playing on the other channel.</p> <p>Trump also immediately showed a remarkable gift for offending people. In the same first speech, Mexican immigrants were dismissed as \u201crapists\u201d, bringing nothing but drugs and crime to the US. Within minutes it was clear this would be a shockingly divisive campaign.</p> <p>But it was a weapon he would wield effectively against Republican opponents. Bush was taunted as \u201clow energy\u201d during a series of debates that played to Trump\u2019s strengths as a TV performer but brought the Grand Old Party down to the level of a schoolyard bully. </p> <p>By the time New Jersey governor Chris Christie joined in by destroying another promising rival, Marco Rubio, it was clear Trump had re-created the brutal dynamic of his reality TV franchise, The Apprentice. Like many bullies, he also showed the thin skin \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/donald-trump-hand-display-madame-tussaud-wax-museum\">small hands</a> \u2013 that Clinton would later learn how to exploit in their own debates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/republicans-lose-election-day-donald-trump-civil-war\">Win or lose, Republicans are heading for civil war after election day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She showed early poise, too, in her debates against Sanders, helped by his determination to focus on their many policy disagreements. \u201cThe American people are sick of hearing about your damn emails,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/13/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-damn-email-server\">conceded</a>, rescuing his opponent from an early controversy over a private email server she had used while working as secretary of state.</p> <p>It was an issue that was to come back to haunt her again. Though many Democrats agreed with Sanders, the email controversy raised worrying questions about Clinton\u2019s penchant for privacy. Why should she evade rules designed to ensure classified information remained safely stored on government computers \u2013 measures that meant embarrassing transgressions might be subject to freedom of information requests? Meanwhile Republicans asked: what did she have to hide?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f15912430b9bd93ad742058561d7a039a8e0cae4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f15912430b9bd93ad742058561d7a039a8e0cae4/0_102_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Making up after a rough Democratic primary season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cj Gunther/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sanders would not avoid digital controversy either.

Hers was, without doubt, one of the most qualified candidacies of modern times.

Michigan was the biggest shock, pointing to the anger in the industrial midwest over trade policy. Wisconsin and Colorado were other states where Sanders would continue to raise the hopes of his supporters and the eye of Republican strategists come November.</p> <p>But Clinton also demonstrated her strength in diverse, prosperous, metropolitan America. Her wins in New York and California finally extinguished the Bern and showed the power of the multi-racial coalition built up by Democrats. Neither Green party candidate Jill Stein nor libertarian Gary Johnson would gain much traction against such a polarising pair of candidates in the months of bitter slogging that followed the primaries.</p> <p>When things looked bleakest for Trump, he would turn abroad for inspiration. He visited Britain the day after it voted to leave Europe to align himself with the mood of rebellion and invited UK Independence party leader Nigel Farage to campaign with him in Mississippi. He would travel to Mexico to try to prove statesmanship, and developed a bizarre affinity with Vladimir Putin that would lead some to suspect Republicans had nominated a modern-day <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/11/is-donald-trump-a-manchurian-candidate\">Manchurian candidate</a>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s authoritarian streak was most visible during the Orwellian-sounding Republican convention in Cleveland where he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/21/donald-trump-republican-national-convention-speech\">proclaimed himself the \u201claw and order candidate\u201d</a>.

Each authority retains some of the grant for central educational spending, and distributes the rest to individual schools according to a locally-calculated formula, subject to certain restrictions. They can also top up the grants to schools from their wider budget. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The last thing you want to do is bring in a new national funding formula at a time of funding crisis</p> <footer> <cite>Valentine Mulholland, NAHT</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Under this system, some authorities receive more funding-per-pupil than others. Inner-city authorities are the biggest beneficiaries: the 10 best-funded areas in England are <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11473308/School-funding-is-a-postcode-lottery-head-teachers-warn.html\">all in London</a>, with the City of London topping the table at \u00a38,595 per pupil. Nottingham, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool all do well while the worst-funded are rural and suburban authorities such as Wokingham (which receives \u00a34,158 per pupil), Poole and South Gloucestershire.</p> <h2>Starting over</h2> <p>In March, the government opened a <a href=\"https://consult.education.gov.uk/funding-policy-unit/schools-national-funding-formula/supporting_documents/Schools_NFF_consultation.pdf\">consultation</a> [pdf] on a proposed new national funding formula. Under this formula, which aims to iron out the inequalities in the current system, the funding each pupil attracts to the school will be determined nationally. The formula will allocate funds according to a number of factors categorised under four broad headings, or \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d (basic per-pupil funding, additional needs, school costs, and geographic costs), but we don\u2019t know yet what weighting will be given to each factor. <br></p> <p>The original plan was to introduce the new formula in April 2017. The disruption caused by the change of government, however, led to a decision to delay implementation until April 2018. The government plans to respond to the first consultation, and launch a second consultation, this autumn.</p> <p>The National Association of Headteachers (NAHT) believes that funding reform is overdue, but has concerns about the timing and the potential impact on inner-city schools. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/oct/05/why-school-funding-unfair\">Why is the school funding system so unfair? \u2013 explainer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Valentine Mulholland, the NAHT\u2019s head of policy, says: \u201cThe last thing you want to do is bring in a new national funding formula at a time of funding crisis.\u201d Schools are already struggling with extra costs and will be hit again by the <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/apprenticeships-how-the-levy-and-hiring-targets-will-affect-schools-and-multi-academy-trusts/\">apprenticeship levy</a> of 0.5% to be introduced in April 2017. </p> <p>An NAHT <a href=\"http://www.naht.org.uk/welcome/news-and-media/key-topics/funding/breaking-point/\">survey</a> last year found that half of headteachers have reduced the hours of teaching assistants, while nearly two-thirds are reducing investment in equipment. Secondary schools, Mulholland says, are \u201chaving to make really difficult decisions about whether they are going to offer drama, music and art GCSE, which are not part of the accountability regime.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s proposals have been met with dismay by those authorities and schools likely to lose out under the new formula. Rob Hull, vice-chair of the Islington Schools Forum, has several concerns. Local authorities\u2019 rich local knowledge, enabling them to use discretion in the allocation of funds, can\u2019t be emulated by national government, he argues. Islington, for example, has been able to give extra funds to help schools deal with a sudden influx of migrant students: \u201cThat group at this time needed help, but it wouldn\u2019t be a long-term need \u2013 they\u2019d have learnt the language and know their way around.\u201d</p> <p>In the new model, a portion of the per-pupil funding will be allocated according to deprivation. A pupil\u2019s degree of deprivation will be determined partly by postcode. While this will work well in parts of the country, Hull says they make no sense in an area such as Islington, where rich owner-occupiers live next door to people in social housing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Because living costs in the inner London boroughs are going up, it\u2019s harder and harder to recruit and retain teachers</p> <footer> <cite>Sue Macmillan, Hammersmith and Fulham council</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He also argues that, when it comes to extra funding for deprived pupils, the government may underestimate the effects of \u201cconcentrated deprivation\u201d, such as a higher number of pupils with English as an Additional Language (EAL). </p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got one child in a class from a deprived background, that child, through being with its peers, can cope better and needs less support than if you\u2019ve got a majority of such children in the classroom.\u201d</p> <p>There are concerns that the dramatic improvement in London schools\u2019 results in the past 15 years could be reversed if funding is cut. Sue Macmillan, cabinet member for children and education on Hammersmith and Fulham council, argues that it makes more sense to \u201clevel up the rest of the country than bring London down\u201d.</p> <p>In Hammersmith and Fulham, says Macmillan, heads are already making efficiency savings by collaborating with other schools, and some are expecting to cut staff numbers. In the meantime, they are also struggling with recruitment as the rising costs in the capital drive teachers away. </p> <p>Other inner-city authorities also face cuts. Councillor Nick Small, assistant mayor for education, employment and skills in Liverpool, says that modelling by the council shows the worst-case scenario is a <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/george-osbornes-20m-raid-liverpool-11657591\">cut of \u00a320m</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/nov/03/are-englands-teachers-being-paid-enough\">Are England's teachers being paid enough?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He says: \u201cOur schools are run really efficiently. There\u2019s not much scope \u2013 if any \u2013 to make these kinds of savings without it affecting the frontline and teaching and learning.\u201d </p> <h2>Unknown territory<br></h2> <p>At the moment, however, no one knows exactly how big the cuts will be or how schools will be helped to prepare for them. School budgets are currently protected by a minimum funding guarantee, which means that no school will lose more than 1.5% funding per pupil in a single year. The government has said the guarantee will continue, but not whether it will remain at 1.5%. </p> <p>This lack of clarity is making it hard for schools to plan ahead, says Natalie Perera, executive director of the thinktank CentreForum. She says: \u201cIf schools know what their end budget will be and how quickly they will lose that money, they will be able to plan for the redundancies they make, if any, and in the case of a secondary school whether they need to drop a subject or a department; but without knowing that, it becomes really difficult.\u201d</p> <p>It means that heads are operating in the dark, to some extent. Sarah Holmes-Carne, headteacher of Kenton School in Newcastle, says she is planning for the worst-case scenario. \u201cBecause Kenton is part of a multi-academy trust, our mantra is if a member of staff leaves we think once, twice, three times about replacing them,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Members of a multi-academy trust are able to share staff in key subject areas, as well as HR and finance, but Holmes-Carne is reluctant to employ staff on short-term contracts because of the potential impact on learning. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/oct/13/schools-new-sources-funding-parents-donations\">Plugging the gap: schools forced to find new sources of funding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Haylock says he may have to consider a narrower curriculum offer and reducing the number of cultural activities. \u201cIt\u2019s about modelling and looking at your capabilities, your student numbers, your staffing \u2013 not looking necessarily to make redundancies but to make savings where people have left and you can look to deploy their roles in a different way,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Sam White, head of William Ellis school in Camden, has always kept within budget and has even managed a surplus most years, but he\u2019s concerned about the impact of the changes on top of the extra costs he already faces. </p> <p>He said: \u201cI\u2019ve carried out three small reorganisations in the school in five years to try to make us more efficient, we\u2019ve got 10 fewer teachers than we had in 2011 and the senior staff is a fraction of the size it was before.\u201d</p> <p>White finds himself in a difficult position. His school has 125 in each year group, currently split into five classes. One option is to increase intake, but in the school\u2019s small classrooms, more than 25 children becomes a squeeze. His perception is that financial pressures are forcing families to move out of inner London into outer London, which would make it harder to attract a bigger intake. Currently, he says, morale at the school is good, and he is reluctant to do anything that will impact that, although he has made a small number of redundancies and almost all his new hires this year are on temporary one-year contracts. </p> <p>The government has pledged to open the second consultation this autumn. The concern among London heads and councils is that the dramatic improvement in results in the city will go into reverse if the new formula is applied. </p> <p>\u201cYou are going to be in a situation where you take away money from students that need it the most,\u201d said Haylock. \u201cAnd that shouldn\u2019t be the way you\u2019re running your education system.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>.

  "<p>A global \u201cgreening\u201d of the planet has significantly slowed the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since the start of the century, according to new research.</p> <p>More plants have been growing due to higher CO2 levels in the air and warming temperatures that cut the CO2 emitted by plants via respiration. The effects led the proportion of annual carbon emissions remaining in the air to fall from about 50% to 40% in the last decade.</p> <p>However, this greening is only offsetting a small amount of the billions of tonnes of CO2 emitted from fossil fuel burning and other human activities and will not halt dangerous global warming. \u201cUnfortunately, this increase is nowhere near enough to stop climate change,\u201d said Dr Trevor Keenan, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the US, who led the new work.</p> <p>The absolute level of CO2 in the atmosphere is continuing to rise, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/24/new-era-of-climate-change-reality-as-emissions-hit-symbolic-threshold\">breaking the milestone of 400 parts per million (ppm) in 2015</a>, and rising temperatures continue to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/17/shattered-records-climate-change-emergency-today-scientists-warn\">surpass records</a>.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://public.wmo.int/en\">World Meteorological Organisation</a> (WMO) warned on Tuesday that 2011-15 was the hottest five-year period ever recorded and that climate change had increased the risk of half of extreme weather events, with some heatwaves made 10 times more likely by global warming.</p> <p>The new study on global greening is <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/NCOMMS13428\">published in Nature Communications</a> by an international team of scientists who concluded cutting carbon emissions remains vital to preventing severe climate change. </p> <p>\u201cEnhanced carbon uptake by the biosphere to date has slowed the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 and our results [suggest] uptake has been especially strong recently,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWithout effective reduction of global CO2 emissions, however, future climate change remains a stark reality.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, director of the Tyndall Centre at the University of East Anglia, who was not part of the new research, said: \u201cNatural vegetation is a fantastic help in slowing down climate change by absorbing about a quarter of our carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. </p> <p>\u201cFundamentally though, this help is not enough to stop the planet warming \u2013 far from it \u2013 carbon emissions have to drop to almost zero to stop global warming.\u201d</p> <p>The scientists used extensive land, air and satellite data to assess how carbon uptake by plants has changed over recent decades and used modelling to help untangle the different factors underlying the changes. It has been unclear whether the fertilisation effect of higher CO2 levels for plants is outweighed by the harm caused to them by warming and droughts.</p> <p>The researchers found that between 1960 and 2000 the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere was increasing every year, but that after 2000 the rate slowed to about the same increase every year. They found that the main factor was the higher CO2 levels, which were just 290ppm at the start of the last century, compared to 400ppm today.</p> <p>Another factor was the slower rate of global temperature increase after 2000, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/nov/24/study-drives-a-sixth-nail-in-the-global-warming-pause-myth\">so-called \u201cpause\u201d</a> during which more of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases went into the oceans than the air. This meant the increasing respiration of plants driven by rising heat was curbed, trapping more carbon.</p> <p>Prof Chris Rapley, at University College London, said: \u201cThe researchers make it clear that this effect is almost certainly temporary. The \u2018greening\u2019 effect of CO2 will ultimately be overwhelmed by the plants\u2019 own respiration and decay, which will cause even more CO2 to be released.\u201d</p> <p>The research also shows the importance of preserving forests and other ecosystems that absorb carbon, said Prof Dave Reay, at the University of Edinburgh: \u201cThe land and oceans have been bailing us out of dangerous climate change for decades. Unless key carbon sinks such as forests are better protected, the delicate green veil that has saved our worst climate blushes will be in tatters.\u201d</p> <p>The WMO submitted its new report to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-22-un-climate-change-conference-marrakech\">UN climate change summit taking place in Morocco</a>. \u201cWe just had the hottest five-year period on record, with 2015 claiming the title of hottest individual year. Even that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/18/2016-locked-into-being-hottest-year-on-record-nasa-says\">record is likely to be beaten in 2016</a>,\u201d said WMO secretary-general, Petteri Taalas.</p> <p>\u201cThe effects of climate change have been consistently visible on the global scale since the 1980s: rising global temperature, both over land and in the ocean; sea-level rise; and the widespread melting of ice,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has increased the risks of extreme events such as heatwaves, drought, record rainfall and damaging floods.\u201d</p>",

Chants of \u201cI believe that she will win\u201d and \u201cMadame President\u201d broke out as the Clintons emerged after voting in the company of an eager herd of locals who appeared to forget their own ballots in the company of the former \u2013 and perhaps future \u2013 first couple.</p> \n<p>Clinton told reporters voting for herself was \u201cthe most humbling feeling\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI know how much responsibility goes with this and so many people are counting on the outcome of this election, what it means for our country,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I will do the very best I can if I\u2019m fortunate enough to win today.\u201d Clinton also confessed to thinking of her late mother, Dorothy Rodham, who she has described as one of her greatest inspirations.</p> \n<p>It was then a quiet afternoon for the Democratic nominee. She taped a series of radio interviews, and prepared for the night that will seal her fate from her home with a small group of confidantes. Clinton was set to watch the returns from The Peninsula, a luxury hotel that, incidentally, sits a block from Trump Tower on Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue. The mood within the campaign was cautiously optimistic, with few signs of a team bracing for the unexpected.</p> \n<p>New, but untested, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/votecastr_election_day_turnout_tracker.html?live=true\">projections of real time voting patterns</a> also appeared to support the Democratic party\u2019s belief that its voters were flocking to the polls, helping rally US stock markets for a second day running. But the Trump campaign reads the turnout signals in a different way, pointing out that the numbers of registered Republicans turning out to vote in battleground states were up on the level seen by Mitt Romney in 2012, while Democrats were seeing smaller turnout than for Obama.</p> \n<p>Some residents of Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side cast their vote in Trump Place, a residential development built by the Republican nominee in the 1990s. The polling station\u2019s name seemed to have no bearing on voting intentions for many of them. \u201cHe\u2019s a misogynist, and he\u2019s phobic of everyone who isn\u2019t like him,\u201d said Juliet Herman, a 52-year-old strategist.</p> \n<p>Slava Hazin, 50, was one of the few outside Trump Place who said they were voting for Trump. \u201cABC,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone but Clinton.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hazin said he \u201ccan\u2019t stand Trump\u201d, but as a Republican, he was voting for him anyway. \u201cIt was the worst lineup we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said of the original Republican candidates. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve voted for some Republican duds but this really takes the cake.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/hillary-clinton-voting-for-myself-was-the-most-humbling-feeling-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5b32v\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2875959\" data-video-name=\"Hillary Clinton: Voting for myself was the 'most humbling feeling' \u2013 video\" data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5821d9f7e4b029b92ca46a08\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/08/161108Clintonvotenew_desk.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/08/161108Clintonvotenew_V3.webm\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/08/161108Clintonvotenew.m3u8\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/hillary-clinton-voting-for-myself-was-the-most-humbling-feeling-video\">Hillary Clinton: Voting for myself was the \u2018most humbling feeling\u2019</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Before polls opened on Tuesday morning, more than 46 million people nationwide had already voted \u2013 compared with the 32.3 million people who voted early <a href=\"http://www.electproject.org/2012_early_vote\">in 2012</a>.

  "<p>Long before Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel prize in literature, pundits used to talk about \u201cDylan versus Keats\u201d, as if you had to choose, and as if Dylan\u2019s poetic transformations of folk song are really so different from what John Keats does in his eerie ballad <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/resources/learning/core-poems/detail/44475\">La Belle Dame sans Merci</a>. </p> <p>When it comes to Dylan\u2019s art, the dice fall differently. Dylan versus John Constable would make no sense, for when it comes to drawing and painting it\u2019s as plain as a Brooklyn ice cream parlour that Bob Dylan is a bluff old traditionalist.</p> <p>He draws and paints what he sees, although in <a href=\"http://www.halcyongallery.com/\">his latest, impressive show</a> at London\u2019s Halcyon Gallery you feel that what he sees is always subtly merging with an America in his mind. Sometimes that inner America seeps out. A crowd of midwesterners gawping at a fairground sideshow that offers a peep into a \u201cHarem\u201d \u2013 surely this has come from Dylan\u2019s dreams? Yet most of the time, with true observation and patient work, he records reality in all its strangeness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aae0fb42de17399166bb3e2865326a8528e0e30a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aae0fb42de17399166bb3e2865326a8528e0e30a/0_0_3277_2206/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manhattan Bridge, Downtown New York, 2015\u20132016 by Bob Dylan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manhattan Bridge, Downtown New York, 2015\u20132016 by Bob Dylan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Reich/Courtesy of Halcyon Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dylan comes along and sketches your car because he likes it parked there outside some fast food joint. He paints a knish and bagel shop, and the blue and yellow light inside it, and the graffiti along the street. He looks up and paints the vastness of skyscrapers, the glory of Manhattan Bridge, or a burning desert sky.</p> <p>This guy can look. His drawings are intricate, sincere, charged with curiosity. He has a living, loose line that stops them descending into mere pedantry. Life astounds him. Most of his sketches are of places on the edge of town or on run-down corners, the fading, interstitial essence of Americana: coffee shops, drive-ins, all-nite venues. Myth haunts these stage sets of American stories and songs, yet they are secretive, mysterious. They are seen from outside by an artist who does not try to learn more or less than his eyes tell him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"36e8a1a8d3ce9e75107f5401d1d7f7cfcdc5edb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36e8a1a8d3ce9e75107f5401d1d7f7cfcdc5edb6/0_0_1980_3208/617.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Dylan, Abandoned Motel, Eureka, 2015\u20132016.\" width=\"617\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Dylan, Abandoned Motel, Eureka, 2015\u20132016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Reich/Courtesy of Halcyon Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is it right to call Dylan an artist at all? The Halcyon Gallery, on New Bond Street among some of London\u2019s glossiest designer shops, is exactly the kind of glitzy joint you might expect to see some celebrity\u2019s self-indulgent art. Is Dylan doing any more than pursuing a hobby? Oddly enough, the night before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/oct/13/bob-dylan-wins-nobel-prize-for-literature-video-report\">his Nobel prize</a> was announced, I attended an event where a critic launched an unprovoked attack on Dylan\u2019s visual art, going on about how awful it supposedly is. In reality it is hard to see how anyone can dislike the evocative pictures of America in Dylan\u2019s new show \u2013 unless you loathe pictures, and think painting, that old thing, should be banned.</p> <p>If you dismiss David Hockney and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/24/robert-crumb-interview-art-and-beauty-exhibition\">Robert Crumb</a> and believe only avant garde conceptual art has value, you won\u2019t like Dylan\u2019s landscapes. Yet if you do admire either of those meticulous artists, there is no reason to look down on Bob Dylan just because he happens to be a rock star. He has a surprising amount in common with Hockney. His art looks more serious with every exhibition. He is turning into a hero for anyone who thinks drawing is a noble thing to do.</p> <p>What really sets his latest show alight, though, is when he expands his sketches into huge paintings in drunken abandon to the power of colour. Purple skies, lurid neons, wet greens and fierce reds \u2013 the colours of Dylan\u2019s landscape are subtle, rich, with just a hint of apocalypse.</p> <p>A real artist made these drawings and paintings. Their integrity is compelling. They demand to be looked at, for their awe and wonder at the beauty and grandeur of being alive. These are the pictures of a true poet.<br></p>",

Many refugees claim they have been harassed by police, who have used the crackdown as an opportunity to extort bribes. The campaign has undermined Pakistan\u2019s now-threadbare boasts about its generous hosting of one of the world\u2019s largest refugee populations.</p> <p>Gula, who appeared as the wide-eyed \u201cAfghan Girl\u201d on the front cover of National Geographic magazine in 1985, has been raising her four children alone after the death of her husband. She is in poor health and is being treated in a Peshawar hospital.</p> <p>At the time of the photograph, taken by Steve McCurry, she was living in one of the sprawling refugee camps that were home to Afghans who had fled to Pakistan to escape fighting between Islamist rebels and the Soviet Union-backed communist government in Kabul.</p> <p>She was found again in 2002 by National Geographic and given a stipend to live off, although there has been controversy in recent days over whether she received all of the money.</p> <p>News of her arrest drew sharp criticism from some Pakistani politicians, particularly from parties representing Pashtuns, the cross-border ethnic group to which Gula belongs.</p> <p>\u201cTargeting the most vulnerable refugee population has upset and embarrassed the people of Pakistan,\u201d said Bushra Gohar, from the Awami National party. \u201cSharbat Gula\u2019s case has exposed the poor treatment meted to the Afghan refugees in Pakistan.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday, the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), the province where Gula was living and was arrested, offered to cancel her deportation. But family members said she had rejected the offer after initial confusion over paperwork a KP government functionary had asked her to sign that she thought was a hospital discharge notice.</p> <p>\u201cIt was an oath and affidavit saying that she wanted to stay in Pakistan but we prepared a fresh application saying she can\u2019t wait to leave Pakistan,\u201d said Naimat Khan, a relative who has been staying by her bedside at Lady Reading hospital in Peshawar.</p> <p>\u201cShe was grabbed from home and sent to jail so obviously she does not wish to live here in Pakistan any more,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The family allege that she was targeted only after a local police officer learned she had money from selling her small house in Peshawar.</p> <p>A grand welcome is planned for her return to Afghanistan, where billboards with her photograph have been erected.</p> <p>After crossing into Afghanistan at the Torkham border post she is due to fly to Kabul for a meeting with Ghani. An Afghan government official said she will be given a house.</p> <p>Abubakar Siddique, a journalist from Radio Free Europe, said Gula\u2019s case had provoked deep anger in Afghanistan, a country where anti-Pakistan sentiment is already high. \u201cThis is an impoverished, vulnerable woman, treated harshly and detained after living in the country for 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was seen as violating the Afghan notion of honour.\u201d</p> <p>The crackdown on refugees has come at a time when relations between the two neighbouring countries are in a deep trough, with Afghanistan furious at Pakistan\u2019s refusal to crack down on the sanctuaries enjoyed by Taliban leaders inside its borders.</p> <p>Ghani has responded to Pakistan\u2019s pressure on refugees by encouraging them to cross the border with a \u201cgrass is green in my land\u201d public relations campaign.</p> <p>Despite the warm words there are serious doubts the Afghan government can cope with the huge influx of people, in addition to the large number of people displaced by fighting within the country.</p> <p>One-and-a-half million Afghans, many of them born in Pakistan, are expected to have moved to Afghanistan by the end of the year.

And if that sounds a little wistful, given that right now it\u2019s overlooking an empty car park surrounded by wire fencing, it has the underlying ring of truth.</p> <p>It\u2019s two decades since I was last in Hull, frozen in my memory as one long Saturday night \u2013 short skirts, hot chips, scuffles in taxi queues, excitement edged with nerves. Back then I was working just over the Humber Bridge in Grimsby, and Hull was the bright light across the water, home of gigs and cavernous nightclubs and all the exotic thrills small towns lack.

Over summer, thousands of locals stripped naked and had themselves painted blue for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/jul/09/sea-of-hull-by-spencer-tunick-in-pictures\">Spencer Tunick installation</a> celebrating the city\u2019s relationship with the sea; <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/turner-prize-2017-hull-announced\">the Turner prize</a> is coming here next year, plus a one-off gig from David Bowie\u2019s old backing band <a href=\"https://www.hull2017.co.uk/whatson/events/the-rise-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-the-spiders-from-mars/\">the Spiders from Mars</a>. \u201cGo on the terraces at Hull City football club, and one of the chants now is, \u2018You\u2019re only here for the culture\u2019,\u201d says Daren Hale, deputy leader of the city council.</p> <p>But this isn\u2019t just about rebranding Hull as a tourist destination \u2013 although it has made <a href=\"https://www.roughguides.com/best-places/2016/top-10-cities/#\">Rough Guide\u2019s list of top 10 world cities to visit this year</a> and a stroll through the old city\u2019s narrow cobbled streets, studded with cosy pubs, reveals a rather different place from the one outsiders imagine. City of Culture is really a shot at economic redemption, and if the idea of building a future on poetry and song feels hopelessly airy-fairy, beneath it is a hard-headed attempt to portray Hull as a feelgood city to which big employers might want to bring their staff. For it\u2019s jobs that will ultimately revive those pockets of the city tourists don\u2019t come to see, as Hale points out: \u201cOnce you come here you see there\u2019s a real creative buzz, and people say: \u2018This is the sort of place you could do business and you could settle\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>But that\u2019s no longer the only vision of Hull\u2019s future on the table. In June, despite warnings that Brexit risked its future as a port city that trades daily with the outside world, Hull voted to leave Europe. If it was already a city at a crossroads, in the words of filmmaker and opening ceremony curator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/20/a-syrian-love-story-review-microcosm-of-global-crisis\">Sean McAllister</a>, it\u2019s even more so now. One road harks back to bygone days when other countries sent their ships here, but not their people; the other evokes a bright, high-skilled future that nonetheless sounds uncertain to people who have heard such promises before. Of all the jaunty City of Culture slogans plastered across the city, the most evocative is a banner near the pierhead. \u201cWhere have you been all our lives?\u201d it asks, in a way that could be plaintive or mildly acerbic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"085f494d12b14d12d2db448ce5d7607a576c1531\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/085f494d12b14d12d2db448ce5d7607a576c1531/0_139_5478_3590/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sign of confidence on a Hull street.

It\u2019s friendly enough to tourists but as the Hull-born author and poet Russ Litten writes in My People Come From The Sea, there\u2019s a tendency to \u201cignore the rest of the country, face away/lips pursed, arms crossed\u201d.</p> <p>Yet there\u2019s a lot going on behind those masks. As the poem goes on, \u201cMy people come from deep waters/My people are deep waters/My people are in deep water.\u201d They are indeed \u2013 Hull was the third most deprived local authority in England last year, with household disposable income a third less than the national average \u2013 but suspicion of City of Culture\u2019s proffered lifebelt lingers. There have been complaints about local artists being overlooked in favour of famous outsiders, and scepticism about what commercial regeneration means for the kind of non-conformist city that remains proud of holding out for years against getting a Starbucks.</p> <p>Litten has long been a driving force on Hull\u2019s musical and literary scene, and while the 2017 programme excites him, he worries too little of it is created by or for locals. \u201cFor people inside the city, I hope it doesn\u2019t make us feel self-conscious,\u201d he says, when asked how he hopes people will feel by the year\u2019s end. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that people would feel empowered to create stuff rather than just consume stuff. And for people from the outside, to be perfectly honest, I couldn\u2019t care less. The minute you start to worry about what people think and how they view you, you\u2019ve had it.\u201d</p> <p>Litten grew up in the Hessle Road area, a working-class community ripped apart in the 1970s when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod_Wars\">territorial battles with Iceland</a> scuppered its fishing industry, and he\u2019s not alone in linking that history with Hull\u2019s flinty resilience. <a href=\"https://filthybroke.bandcamp.com/track/my-people-come-from-the-sea\">My People Come From The Sea</a>, improvised for a spoken word album with local musician Steve Cobby, is based on their grandfathers\u2019 stories. \u201cOur families lived close to death,\u201d he says simply. \u201cSix times more people died in fishing than in mining. Where I\u2019m from was like a village within a city and it bred a specific type of person, very stoic.\u201d When Sheffield and Hull both flooded a few years back, he says, TV crews descended on Sheffield to film stricken householders but Hull just cracked on, out of sight and mind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cde1c87bc87d22a6b49ca183fe9881232c190ab8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cde1c87bc87d22a6b49ca183fe9881232c190ab8/0_8_5175_3104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hull marina ... the business development alongside includes a hub for tech startups...

It has a quirky, almost eccentric side supporting a thriving artistic scene, and Litten argues that it\u2019s a great place to be creative; rents are cheap, geographical isolation fosters originality, and so does the landscape of sea to the east and rolling fields to the west. \u201cIt\u2019s flat, and artists like a horizon, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p> <p>But years of being laughed at by outsiders \u2013 famously, the book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/oct/02/britishidentity.regeneration\">Crap Towns</a> once called it Britain\u2019s \u201cworst place to live\u201d \u2013 has left its mark.</p> <p>\u201cCulturally and psychologically, because the city was run down by people outside for so long, it kind of bites,\u201d says Andrew Young, a strategic consultant to universities whose Twitter account <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hullbhoy\">@Hullbhoy</a> plugs all that\u2019s good about his home town. He sees City of Culture both as injecting new ideas and challenging those who knock Hull without ever having been: \u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic to have the spotlight on the city and big national players on the stage. We don\u2019t get the London Philharmonic here, but we\u2019ve got it in 2017.\u201d</p> <p>Yet he concedes the spotlight isn\u2019t comfortable for everyone. \u201cPeople in Hull can be quite timid in terms of shouting about what they do. If you go to Glasgow people aren\u2019t slow in coming forward and telling you what\u2019s going on. We don\u2019t do that so much.\u201d And that ingrained reticence can make Hull a hard city to help.</p> <p>Diana Johnson, MP for Hull North, says the city was \u201clate to the party\u201d in the boom years for urban regeneration, hesitating to hustle for funding when rivals such as Newcastle and Liverpool were doing so. And now it\u2019s finally at the front of the queue, the party is winding down. Few envisage Conservative ministers spending more now on rundown estates than Labour did during a boom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81cf4e69115fef6f1457287e8095e0dc3e972b86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81cf4e69115fef6f1457287e8095e0dc3e972b86/0_156_4932_2960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seagoing heritage ...

Alan Johnson, MP for Hull West and Hessle, has argued offshore wind could do for the city what oil did for Aberdeen, and if that was a cheerier analogy before the oil price crashed, it\u2019s still a breakthrough for a city that\u2019s struggled in the past to woo inward investors. The city\u2019s luck seemed to be turning, which in some ways makes the decisive backing for Brexit more surprising. </p> <p>Hale puts it down to a now familiar mix of anti-establishment feeling, longstanding anger at the EU\u2019s treatment of the fishing industry, but above all immigration.</p> <p>For decades Hull had experienced relatively little, but then eastern Europeans started coming to work on the outlying farms as well as in the city. Drive north of the centre, past the leafy university quarter, and you soon find a scruffier landscape of pound shops and cut-price carwashes, many of the latter immigrant-owned. In the mid-90s the biggest ethnic minority group in town was Chinese, according to Hale, constituting about 1% of the population; now, he reckons anywhere up to 15% are from immigrant backgrounds. \u201cIt\u2019s been massively good for the city in lots of ways but it\u2019s a massive change in the culture.\u201d</p> <p>The incomers have, he says, helped reverse inner-city decline by bringing empty shops and homes into use: \u201cPeople hark back to the day of the butcher, baker and candlestick maker but those shops had gone. The eastern Europeans were opening up boarded-up, empty shops.\u201d</p> <p>But Ukip, now second behind Labour in Hull\u2019s three parliamentary seats, is finding a ready audience for its message here. The vote, Johnson thinks, was a protest not just against immigration but \u201cthe fact that Hull hasn\u2019t done as well in recent years, people feel their wages don\u2019t go up as fast as prices\u201d. And then there were those who, like some of Litten\u2019s friends on the left, voted Leave for radical socialist reasons. \u201cIt was a \u2018fuck you\u2019 to the establishment, saying don\u2019t tell us what to do,\u201d he explains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cb6fcea1b941f2a74705e705684661f90f4f8cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cb6fcea1b941f2a74705e705684661f90f4f8cd/0_180_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Deep ...

But it had ultimately hoped to export turbines made here across Europe, and local politicians are worried about the longterm prospects for investment given uncertainty over life outside a single market. If the worst fears about a hard Brexit are realised, Hull may just have voted to shoot itself in the foot. </p> <p>Walking to a meeting in the city, I cross its last foiled attempt at regeneration. The innovative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jul/28/scale-lane-bridge-hull-review\">Scale Lane Bridge</a> over the river Hull, which swings aside for shipping, is where Tunick assembled his naked blue people but it\u2019s more than just a landmark. It was originally conceived to link the picturesque old city on the west bank with a largely derelict industrial site on the east, which would then be turned into a swanky waterside development complete with new hotel. The hotel was built but the banking crash killed off everything else, leaving just an unusually spectacular approach to a marooned Premier Inn, and a reminder of Hull\u2019s vulnerability to forces beyond its control.</p> <p>The optimist\u2019s view is that if hard times are coming again, they could at least foster creative revival. \u201cAll great art is born out of struggle, and the need for survival,\u201d says Litten. \u201cLook at punk, reggae, acid house.\u201d</p> <p>If new artforms are to emerge in Hull, however, they may come from the development around the marina, which includes a spanking new hub for tech startups. It\u2019s not Shoreditch, but you could live here far more cheaply than in London while trying to get a business off the ground \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/hull-50-best-urban-places-live-list-8211-sunday/story-26126697-detail/story.html\">Hull made the Sunday Times top 10 urban places to live last year</a> partly for its affordable housing \u2013 and the idea is to encourage computer science students from the University of Hull to stay around after graduation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f584c57606e017843532bf4526f95d4387a811ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f584c57606e017843532bf4526f95d4387a811ef/0_291_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beneath the city\u2019s tough outer skin there\u2019s an offbeat charm ...

Hull may never quite be Liverpool, reinvented as a sexy weekend destination with its Beatles Museum and its Tate and its thriving bars. But there\u2019s an offbeat charm beneath this city\u2019s tough outer skin and if nothing else, it deserves respect for trying. This is a bold roll of the dice, from a city that doesn\u2019t necessarily have a plan B. What\u2019s the worst that could happen if you gave it an evening or a weekend of your free time?</p> <p>Walking back later towards the bridge, I pass a karaoke bar where men are downing cut-price pints while someone belts out a song I\u2019ve not heard for decades: the Beautiful South\u2019s Perfect 10. \u201cI love her body, especially the lies/Time takes its toll, but not on the eyes.\u201d Time has taken its toll on Hull, but the bones of what it was and could be remain. Change is happening, all right. Hopefully for the better.</p>",

We were on a family holiday in Jaipur and my father had gone into another one of his viciously violent rages the day before. We had all had a sleepless night. It wasn\u2019t the first time: we had gone through this so many times before. I don\u2019t know why it was this time that made me snap. Something about the pink city of royals triggered a desperation in me that I didn\u2019t know existed.</p> <p>I found a quiet moment with my mother. Sobbing, I implored her to find me a way out of that life. I don\u2019t think she knew about the times I cut myself. My own physical pain was the only thing that helped drown the screaming, crying and sounds of violence. I never told her. I don\u2019t know why, but she heard me that day. She spent the next few months researching undergraduate schools in the US that offered scholarships to international students. I got here through the sheer determination of a mother trying to find her daughter a better future. </p> <p>I went to undergraduate and graduate school in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York. On a chilly day in October, I saw snow for the first time. I was in my first year seminar class. A friend from Pakistan and I begged our professor to have the rest of the class outside when the first fluffy flakes began to fall. It was exactly as I had seen in the movies. The world felt like a snow globe. Each snowflake was so luscious and soft; all I wanted to do was eat it. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/01/uk-class-identity-america-customs-socioeconomic-divide\">In the UK, I am working-class.

As my wet hair, teary eyelashes and dripping nose froze, the only thought in my cold brain was Titanic\u2019s Rose and Jack freezing in the Atlantic Ocean. <br></p> <p>Like most international students, I had my fair share of \u201cwhen did you learn English\u201d type of questions. My favorite was: is it comfortable for me to wear shoes in the US? It took me a while to figure out that they thought Indians didn\u2019t wear shoes. I was also asked whether my parents would pick me up at the airport on a camel or an elephant. I wish! That would be so much grander than a dinky car. At the peak of the Iraq invasion, a man in his 40s drinking alone at a bar told me to go back to Iraq. Angrily, I retorted that it wasn\u2019t \u201ceye-rack\u201d and that he should first learn to pronounce the name of a country before passing judgments. <br></p> <p>Years later, in a garage in San Francisco\u2019s Japantown, a lady yelled at me to go back to my country.

I wanted to tell her that if immigrants went back to \u201ctheir\u201d countries, she wouldn\u2019t have fruits and vegetables in her grocery store, doctors in her healthcare facility, a computer to track her social media on. Hell, even she wouldn\u2019t be here. Instead, I screeched an expletive in my highest-pitched raging voice. I think I felt threatened that someone had assumed, just by looking at me, that I didn\u2019t belong, that this was not my home. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/25/vietnam-boat-people-refugees-america-reunited\">My family fled Vietnam for America.

  "<p>The 2016 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/mar/25/us-election-2016-delegate-tracker-trump-cruz-kasich-sanders-clinton\">Republican primary</a> was supposed to be an embarrassment of riches for the GOP. </p> <p>In contrast to 2012, the Republican party was set to feature a slew of young, articulate conservative superstars fighting it out for the nomination. The only question was whether it would be the year of a tough-as-nails union-busting Wisconsin governor (Scott Walker), an inspiring Florida senator (Marco Rubio), an ideological Texas firebrand (Ted Cruz), or perhaps an Oxford-educated policy wonk from the Bayou (former governor Bobby Jindal). Or, maybe, one of the more seasoned former conservative governors would win the day, such as Florida\u2019s Jeb Bush or Texas\u2019s Rick Perry.</p> <p>But such hopes were dashed on 16 June 2015 when one Donald J Trump took what he now calls the \u201cfamous escalator ride\u201d down Trump Tower to announce his candidacy. The establishment immediately mocked him. But he went on to shock them.</p> <p>Over the next 11 months, the ideologically malleable alleged billionaire browbeat his way to the Republican nomination. He tagged his opponents as too low energy (Bush), too dishonest (Cruz) and too little and sweaty (Rubio) for the Oval Office. He would allow nothing to stand in his way \u2013 certainly not the truth \u2013 in his quest for the Republican nomination. </p> <p>To evangelicals, the thrice-married New Yorker with a potty mouth that made even Howard Stern blush pretended to be a committed Christian, even declaring that the reason the IRS was auditing his tax returns was probably because of his religious devotion. To immigration hawks, he pledged to deport each and every illegal immigrant in the country, even though he said after the 2012 election that the reason Mitt Romney lost was because of his harsh stand on immigration. </p> <p>But Trump didn\u2019t win the Republican nomination because of his policy positions. He won because of his personality and brand. For nearly four decades, he painted himself as the world\u2019s greatest businessman. Trump\u2019s lifelong marketing scheme got a boost from Hollywood in 2004 when he was cast as the star of the NBC reality TV show The Apprentice, where he flaunted his executive authority each week in front of millions.</p> <p>Trump was at his best when he wasn\u2019t talking specifics. He promised to make all America\u2019s problems go away, to make America great again, if Americans just put their faith in him. He was the strongman who was going to make everything OK if you just trusted him and didn\u2019t ask questions.</p> <p>And it worked in the Republican primary. But the nomination fight revealed much more about Trump\u2019s Republican opponents and the Republican electorate than it did about Trump. To those who cared to look, it was well known before Trump ever entered the presidential race that he was a dishonest lout whose business success was far less than claimed. </p> <p>But Trump\u2019s presence in the race revealed that the supposed GOP superstars were too weak to stand up to the charlatan in their midst. As for the Republican primary electorate, we learned that perhaps they don\u2019t care so much about conservative principles after all \u2013 that the conservative movement may be nothing more than a collection of magazine offices and think tanks in Manhattan and Washington, DC. No true believer in conservative principles could ever get behind Donald Trump. </p> <p>In winning the Republican nomination, Donald Trump may have destroyed the Republican party and drastically set back the conservative movement. His anti-immigrant vitriol, his mainstreaming of conspiracy theories, his portrayal of American exceptionalism as an arrogant concept, his anti-women invective and, yes, his occasional racism will taint the Republican party for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Well, it will taint the Republican party if it lasts. But that remains an open question. The odds are Hillary Clinton will win, and the question will then be: what will become of the Republican party? Will the #NeverTrump wing and the Always Trump forces come together? Or will a civil war break out, ultimately tearing the party it apart? </p> <p>The GOP should have been ascendant this election cycle. Instead, it lies in ruins, all thanks to Donald Trump. He\u2019s the man of the hour, exactly as he would want it to be. </p>",
  "<p>Almost as staggering as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/nov/23/cities-in-numbers-how-patterns-of-urban-growth-change-the-world\">current enormous influx into cities across the globe</a> is the dramatic slowdown in urbanisation that will follow it. The world is literally going to town on urbanisation \u2013 but it is a project that is both immense and historically fleeting. </p> <p>In less than 100 years, the world\u2019s urban population is expected to double to 8 or 9 billion \u2013 accounting for the bulk of a <a href=\"https://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/Publications/Files/WUP2014-Highlights.pdf\">projected global population of around 11 billion</a>. Yet in all the centuries that follow this one, cities may add, at most, another billion to their ranks. So if this century is the most urbanising in history, it will also mark the end of humankind\u2019s \u201cgreat urbanisation\u201d era.<br></p> <p>Thus the next few decades will be hugely influential in determining the patterns of production, behaviour and governance that humanity locks into, and the innovative efficiency with which it utilises the earth\u2019s resources. The future of the world\u2019s urban population will mostly be built in our lifetimes. </p> <p>The consequences of bad government and inaction over planning and urban design will last decades or centuries. Once the urban population is stable, and road, rail and utility networks have been laid down, it will be much harder to undertake reform or retrofit urban infrastructure. This is why the subject deserves the urgent attention of policymakers, academics and business entrepreneurs worldwide.<br></p> <p>This week, global leaders are meeting in Marrakech for the 22nd UN climate summit (<a href=\"http://cop22.ma/en\">Cop22</a>). They are discussing how to limit greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently to hold global warming well below 2\u00b0C, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points\">as was agreed a year ago in Paris</a>.

A <a href=\"http://newclimateeconomy.report/\">recent study</a> by the World Resources Institute put the health impacts in China of PM2.5 exposure (including premature deaths) at a shocking 10-13% of the country\u2019s annual GDP.</p> <p>Thus, air pollution is one key reason why the <a href=\"http://newclimateeconomy.report/2014\">Global Commission on the Economy and Climate</a> found that more than half of the reduction in global emissions required to meet an ambitious climate target could generate net benefits to the economy.</p> <p>Implementing policy action to reduce emissions is often easiest at the city level. This means increased effort is required to devolve administration to the urban level and empower cities through greater fiscal autonomy. Things like recycling schemes, energy from waste, broadband networks, integrated public transport systems, \u201csmart\u201d buildings and biking networks are easy to appreciate and can come with popular local support.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Corruption stifles incentives to work and innovate \u2026 and risks rendering cities dysfunctional</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Local accountability is also a vital part of good governance.

Corruption stifles incentives to work and innovate, undermining property rights and threatening to usurp the returns to productive activities. This offsets many of the benefits of urban clustering, and risks rendering cities dysfunctional.<br></p> <p>The tragedy is that some of the poorest cities in the world are also the fastest growing \u2013 and they lack the resources and capacity to prevent locking into structures that are inefficient, unreliable and polluting.<br></p> <p>New mechanisms to finance investments in urban infrastructure and smart technology need to be developed. These may include: greater use of land-value capture mechanisms, where the construction of new transit infrastructure is financed with the profits generated by the increase in land value stimulated by the presence of that infrastructure; municipal bonds such as Johannesburg\u2019s recently issued $136m (\u00a3110m) green bond; and the creation of dedicated national, regional or city-level investment platforms as mechanisms for aggregating smaller infrastructure projects and attracting private investment at scale.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/nov/17/cities-climate-change-problems-solution\">Climate change and cities: a prime source of problems, yet key to a solution</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But successful urbanisation is not just about infrastructure; it\u2019s also about skills.

We can question his sincerity, but the gestures are there. He even briefly tempered his tone regarding Mexicans during a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-mexico-visit-20160831-snap-story.html\">quickly arranged visit</a> to President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico City last August. </p> <p>His daughter <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3063963/behind-the-brand/ivanka-trump-doesnt-flinch\">Ivanka</a> and wife <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/17/politics/melania-trump-interview/\">Melania</a> have defended him for his unforgivable behavior toward women, and Ivanka also <a href=\"http://time.com/4515709/ivanka-trump-campaign-ad-women/\">recorded</a> an official campaign television advertisement openly courting women voters for her father. Trump denies the charge he mocked a disabled reporter, and despite a bevy of antisemitic <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/donald-trump-anti-semitism-young-jews-214314\">incidents</a> involving Trump and his supporters over the past months, he has also <a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/florida-jewish-journal/news/broward/fl-jjbs-candidates-1102-20161101-story.html\">directly</a> sought Jewish American support. Such is his style of leadership: he may insult you, but he still wants your vote. </p> <p>Not so with the Muslims. A tiny handful of Muslim Americans may, bizarrely, be Trump supporters, but that doesn\u2019t diminish the fact that, while attempting to engage every other constituency, Trump\u2019s campaign has made essentially zero public outreach to the Muslim electorate. It\u2019s as if Muslim citizens already don\u2019t exist in Trump\u2019s America.</p> <p>The irony is that Trump\u2019s willful blindness to Muslim voters may lead to his defeat. Muslims may only account for a small part of the American population, but a concerted <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/a/us-election-muslim-voters/3576727.html\">push</a> by Muslim Americans during this season has meant that there are now over a million registered Muslim voters, more than double the number in 2012. And Muslims tend to live in key battleground states such as Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia. </p> <p>But Hillary Clinton may not be able to count on all of those votes either. Many Muslim Americans have long been uncomfortable with her hawkish foreign policy record and her superficially inclusive rhetoric. \u201cWe need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our frontlines,\u201d is a standard Clinton refrain, and with it we hear the suggestion that our communities live on some kind of \u201cfrontline\u201d of warfare. </p> <p>This is so not true: the front line of Costco, maybe. Most Muslim Americans are boring, middle-class folk. Clinton also seems to see Muslim Americans as separate from her idea of \u201cwe\u201d (\u201cwe\u201d need \u201cthem\u201d to be part of \u201cus\u201d) and to believe that we, as a group, carry some insider knowledge about evildoers that we may \u2013 or may not! \u2013 be willing to trade in exchange for equal treatment in the United States. </p> <p>This is offensive to our citizenship, and Muslim Americans must be afforded the same rights and protections as everyone else without precondition. But what this campaign has really shown is how contested and precarious the place is for Muslim Americans today. That won\u2019t change after 8 November, regardless of who wins. </p> <p>Even with a Clinton victory, Trump and his \u201cmovement\u201d, which is how he refers to his campaign, will not simply vanish. And the suggestion that Trump is merely using the election as a platform from which to start a new media empire is hardly comforting, as if there has never been a connection between mass media and far-right politics. So how prepared are we, as a nation, to deal with Trumpism after Tuesday?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/11/911-15-anniversary-united-states-lessons\">How we learned all the wrong lessons from 9/11 | Moustafa Bayoumi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If there\u2019s any good news to come out of this election, it\u2019s that the country now recognizes the potent political force that is Islamophobia.

What do these stops tell us about the race?</p> <p>Typically, last-minute campaign decisions are based on internal campaign polling not available to the public. Such polling explains why Al Gore campaigned at 2am in Florida on election day in 2000, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stuartpstevens/status/795685460953677826\">as confusing as that move was</a> for the opposition at the time.</p> <p>The late moves of the 2016 campaign may be trickier to decode, in part because of the drunken-ninja style of the Donald Trump campaign, which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/795722142159605760\">reportedly</a> ceased conducting its own polling last week or even two weeks ago.</p> <p>The action in Michigan, visited twice by Clinton and four times by Trump, may be most interesting. The Great Lakes state emerged as an object of interest relatively late in the race, with both campaigns having dispensed with other, more central fights, and with the Trump campaign sensing opportunity with the state\u2019s white blue-collar voters. The Clinton campaign hopes the state\u2019s Democratic voting record since 1988 will be good for 16 electoral votes Tuesday night.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/clinton-trump-final-campaign-stops-election-what-it-means\">The last-minute map: how to read each presidential candidate\u2019s final stops</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58214bdae4b029b92ca467a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T03:56:06.278Z\">3.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Shares in Asian markets \u2013 where it\u2019s Tuesday already \u2013 have edged up as the prospect of a Clinton win looks more likely, Reuters reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Most Asian stock markets rose on Tuesday ahead of the election, with investors optimistic but cautious over improving prospects for a win by Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>The Mexican peso, which strengthens as the perceived chances of an election victory by Donald Trump fall, retained its strong gains from Monday.</p> <p>The dollar, which also advanced on Monday, edged slightly lower. </p> <p>Boosting Clinton\u2019s chances of winning, and markets globally, was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-criminal-james-comey\">statement by the FBI on Sunday</a> standing by its July finding that Clinton was not guilty of criminal wrongdoing in her use of a private email server. </p> <p>That came after the FBI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">announced on 28 October</a> it was reviewing additional emails relating to the server while Clinton was secretary of state, sending markets around the world tumbling. </p> <p>Clinton is seen by investors as offering greater certainty and stability, and, until last week\u2019s stumble, had been seen as the likely victor in Tuesday\u2019s presidential vote. </p> <p>But investors remained wary, noting Britain\u2019s shock vote in June to leave the European Union had defied most polls and bookmakers\u2019 odds. <br></p> <p>\u201cAs markets head into the U.S. election, a final recalibration of risk is in train,\u201d Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, wrote in a note. <br></p> <p>\u201cAsia-Pacific markets were the first to adjust to the political shift, and may trade more modestly today after roaring back to life yesterday.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on markets in Asia and beyond as the votes are totted up on Tuesday (or Wednesday as it\u2019s known in some parts of the globe).</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58214ad7e4b029b92ca467a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T03:48:25.836Z\">3.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Miami Herald op-ed page is keeping it simple tomorrow:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PatriciaMazzei/status/795819819090186240\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Prediction: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeraldOpEd\">@HeraldOpEd</a> gonna get a *few* emails about this one.

Brady was suspended for four games at the start of the 2016 season for his role in the Deflategate scandal.<br></p> <p>Speaking in Manchester, New Hampshire, the Republican nominee told the cheering crowd that Brady called him earlier on Monday to say: \u201cDonald, I support you. You\u2019re my friend and I voted for you.\u201d</p> <p>The quarterback was photographed in 2015 with a Make America Great Again hat in his locker. Brady <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/12/15/tom-brady-donald-trump-is-a-good-friend-and-i-support-my-friends/\">also said</a> in an interview in December 2015: \u201cDonald is a good friend of mine.

The famously taciturn and obsessive coach has won four Super Bowls with Brady as his quarterback and is considered one of the greatest coaches in NFL history. Belichick\u2019s girlfriend <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/bill-belichick-donald-trump-new-england-patriots-presidential-candidate-030616\">posted a picture</a> on Instagram of Trump and the NFL coach in the spring, describing the Republican nominee as \u201cour good friend\u201d.</p> <p>Trump announced after the Brady endorsement that Belichick \u201cwrote me the most beautiful letter\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Congratulations on a tremendous campaign. You have dealt with an unbelievable slanted and negative media and come out beautifully. You have proved to be the ultimate competitor and fighter.

The judge slammed the local Democratic party for \u201cbelated, inflammatory allegations<strong> </strong>that<strong> </strong>appear intended to generate only heat, not light\u201d.</p> <p>The supreme court on Monday also denied a request to restore a sweeping temporary restraining order issued by a federal judge in Ohio last week, which had briefly enjoined the Trump campaign, Stone, and Stop the Steal, as well as the Clinton campaign, from engaging in a variety of voter intimidation behaviors.

The familiar syntax was not lost on us Latinos, who have been told to \u201cgo back\u201d for as long as we\u2019ve been in the United States, whether we were born here or not.</p> <p>Before he was forcibly removed, Ramos was criticizing Trump for effectively saying he would deport 11 million undocumented people and build a 1,900-mile border wall. Well, Trump skirted those specifics, but that was the reality of what he was proposing. We Latinos were put in a familiar place \u2013 where we are merely numbers or parasites to the economy, seen not for our worth as human beings but for our worth as laborers.</p> <p><em>Al mal tiempo, buena cara, </em>goes an old Mexican proverb. \u201cTo the bad times, good face.\u201d When I first delved into the world of activism, I used to hold the saying in contempt. It seemed to feed into the bottomless humility of the Mexican American in the face of oppression, the immigrant family, the Chicano who doesn\u2019t want to make a fuss. It painted us, I thought, as a people who merely stood by while bad things happened to us.</p> <p>Watching the Trump campaign, being its first scapegoats, I felt we were in that helpless place where our only option was to endure. The slogan Make America Great Again encapsulated exactly how we are seen in this country. We are the unclean other, our culture dilutes the purity of America\u2019s white citizens who must be protected from us. Make America great again \u2013 by kicking us out.</p> <p>Violence <a href=\"http://americasvoice.org/trumphatemap/\">against Latinos surged</a>, at Trump rallies and across the country. Xenophobia and racism were whipped into a fever pitch by the demagogue\u2019s rants, his constant attacks on our families and our neighbors. \u201cSend them back\u201d was a phrase I heard more in those months than I ever had in my life. \u201cYou have to go back\u201d became a common response to everything I wrote. Something had changed.</p> <p>It was Trump\u2019s attack on US district court judge Gonzalo P Curiel, born in Indiana and of Mexican descent, that saw our worst fears begin to take shape in reality.

They are, in fact, widespread and even predicted by some local officials.</p> <p>Since 2000, the popularity of early voting has increased from 12% of the electorate to an anticipated 40% this year, according to a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/early-voting-2016-election/\">CBS report of the AP Election Research Group</a>. During that same time though, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-love-early-voting-and-it-might-help-clinton/\">Republican-led</a> legislatures have pushed back against early voting in Ohio, Arizona and Nebraska. </p> <p>Why?</p> <p>In-person early voting tends to benefit Democrats. In North Carolina, for example, 60% of black voters \u2013 a reliably Democratic group \u2013 cast early ballots, as opposed to 44% of white voters, according to the <a href=\"https://www.facingsouth.org/2016/09/why-early-voting-matters\">Institute for Southern Studies</a>.</p> <p>Following the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html\">US Supreme Court\u2019s dismantling</a> of the Voting Rights Act, which required some southern states to get pre-approval of election law changes from the federal government, North Carolinian state representatives passed a law that <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/07/29/fourth_circuit_strikes_down_north_carolina_voting_restrictions.html\">eliminated early voting on one Sunday</a>. In part, that move was designed to impact \u201csouls to the polls\u201d day, a powerful program that brings black churchgoers to vote after Sunday service.</p> <p>A judge struck down that state law in July, finding that it targeted African Americans \u201c<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/07/29/fourth_circuit_strikes_down_north_carolina_voting_restrictions.html\">with almost surgical precision</a>\u201d. Nevertheless, <a href=\"https://www.facingsouth.org/2016/09/why-early-voting-matters\">three North Carolina counties</a> still managed to limit early voting the Sunday before election day.</p> <p>Research from the Brennan Center for Justice on three states with the longest lines in 2012, Florida, Maryland and South Carolina, found that voters in urban areas tended to have fewer machines, less poll workers or both. More research cited by the center backs up findings that voters in <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2016/10/11/democrats-maintain-edge-as-party-more-concerned-for-latinos-but-views-similar-to-2012/\">Latino</a> and African American districts tend to wait the longest (both constituencies lean Democratic).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9e33d07f2741447a79ff6aa2b190503a8dc2a67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9e33d07f2741447a79ff6aa2b190503a8dc2a67/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A line of early voters waits outside the Franklin County Board of Elections, Monday, Nov. 7, 2016, in Columbus, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A line of early voters waits outside the Franklin County Board of Elections, Monday, Nov. 7, 2016, in Columbus, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Minchillo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just this spring, lines were so long in Arizona that voters of both parties were <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/03/25/471891525/arizona-polling-places-overwhelmed-with-long-lines-on-primary-day\">livid</a>. Why? Republican state officials cut budgets for county officials, who in turn demanded cheap elections, which cut polling places. Democratic leaders tended to blame Republicans, who cut budgets. Arizona was another state that used to be required to seek pre-approval of election law changes under the Voting Rights Act.</p> <p>If politicians wanted to end long lines, experts say some simple recommendations could make a big impact. A January 2014 report called The American Voting Experience looked at ways that officials could predict and plan for voter turnout, after Floridians waited <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/no-one-in-america-should-have-to-wait-7-hours-to-vote/264506/\">seven hours</a> to vote for Barack Obama in 2012.</p> <p>They found that expanding early voting, online registration, new technologies and efficient polling place management could all help reduce and eliminate long wait times. </p> <p>So if you\u2019re waiting in a long line, congratulate your fellow voters, and consider a letter to you local election commission. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5820cee2e4b07ceadb3a34c6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T19:00:40.062Z\">7.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Obama picks up on report that aides confiscated Trump's Twitter</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Don\u2019t miss this from the New York Times: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/us/politics/donald-trump-presidential-race.html\">Inside Donald Trump\u2019s Last Stand: An Anxious Nominee Seeks Assurance</a>. <br></p> <p>Among the juicy details: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Aides to Mr. Trump have finally wrested away <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/\">the Twitter account</a> that he used to colorfully \u2014 and often counterproductively \u2014 savage his rivals.

It was about whether a woman could be the president of the US.</p> <p>How did it even start? I was no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/feminism\">feminist</a> prodigy, just a shy kid who preferred reading to talking; politics weren\u2019t my destiny. Probably, I was trying to work out what was possible for my category of person \u2013 legally, logistically \u2013 as one might ask which kinds of terrain are navigable for a newly purchased bicycle. Up until then, gender hadn\u2019t darkened my mental doorway as I followed my older brother into our daily adventures wearing hand-me-down jeans.</p> <p>But in adolescence it dawned on me I\u2019d be spending my future as a woman, and when I looked around, alarm bells rang. My mother was a capable, intelligent, deeply unhappy woman who aspired to fulfilment as a housewife but clearly disliked the job. I saw most of my friends\u2019 mothers packed into that same dreary boat. My father was a country physician, admired and rewarded for work he loved. In my primordial search for a life coach, he was the natural choice.</p> <p>I probably started by asking him if girls could go to college, have jobs, be doctors, tentatively working my way up the ladder. His answers grew more equivocal until finally we faced off, Dad saying, \u201cNo\u201d and me saying, \u201cBut why not?\u201d A female president would be dangerous. His reasons vaguely referenced menstruation and emotional instability, innate female attraction to maternity and aversion to power, and a general implied ickyness that was beneath polite conversation.</p> <p>I ended that evening curled in bed with my fingernails digging into my palms and a silent howl tearing through me that lasted hours and left me numb. The next day I saw life at a remove, as if my skull had been jarred. What changed for me was not a dashing of specific hopes, but an understanding of what my father \u2013 the person whose respect I craved \u2013 really saw when he looked at me. I was tainted. I would grow up to be a lesser person, confined to an obliquely shameful life.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the full piece here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/06/hillary-clinton-white-house-donald-trump-bullying-barbara-kingsolver\">End this misogynistic horror show.

(In 2012, the state did not report results until four days after election day.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/794215432135864320\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Giving the high early vote totals in both FL and NC, we&#39;re going to know fairly early on whether Clinton has won or Trump still has a shot.</p>&mdash; (((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/794215432135864320\">November 3, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Steve Schale is a Democratic analyst who ran Florida operations for Obama in 2008. He<strong> <a href=\"http://steveschale.com/\">sees low-propensity Hispanic voters</a> </strong>\u2013 meaning voters who weren\u2019t judged especially likely to turn out \u2013 <strong>pushing the election in Clinton\u2019s direction:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But two things emerged last week. One, this low propensity Hispanic thing became a thing. While Trump folks argued that Trump would turn out low propensity voters, we\u2019d see slight edges for Democrats in this category. What became clear over days last week, this was a Hispanic deal, and as week 2 of early voting took hold, so did this surge. As of Saturday, Democrats had an edge of more than 175K low propensity voters.</p> </blockquote> <p>Schale also sees <a href=\"http://steveschale.com/\">serious strength</a> for <strong>Clinton in Miami-Dade:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dade is at 11.9% of all votes cast so far (should be 10.3%), and Broward is at 9.55%, where I had it pegged at 8.75%. The media market is a full two points bigger than it should be. If the Miami market finishes at 21.8% of all votes, this thing is cooked, and we will know it before 8:00 (assuming Miami decides to count all these ballots)</p> </blockquote> <p>Schale sees <strong>Clinton \u201cunder-performing\u201d in Palm Beach county,</strong> two counties north of Miami:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The red flag for Dems: Palm Beach. It is at 62% of its 2012 total, and it is also the county most \u201cunder-performing.\u201d It should be about 7% of the state vote, but today it is about 5.9%. Of all the data points right now, this is the only one that concerns me. While Miami is more than making up for it, for HRC, win path is much easier with a more robust Palm Beach.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a51b3fa0aebea1a11c2e7e8618af8dd2a7fb7f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a51b3fa0aebea1a11c2e7e8618af8dd2a7fb7f4/0_0_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Recording artist Stevie Wonder performing prior to President Obama coming on stage at a Clinton rally at Osceola County Stadium, Kissimmee, Florida, November 6, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recording artist Stevie Wonder performing prior to President Obama coming on stage at a Clinton rally at Osceola County Stadium, Kissimmee, Florida, November 6, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://steveschale.com/\">Here\u2019s Schales conclusion:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am going to write a wrap tomorrow for E-Day, but two questions I get a lot.</p> <p>What am I worried about for HRC?</p> <p>Really, almost nothing. I\u2019ve mentioned the Palm Beach thing a few times, but right now, the diversity mix is rounding nicely into shape, and our best counties are way out-performing the state. Right now, she needs the organization on the ground to get this done on Tuesday</p> <p>Could there be a Trump surge on Tuesday? It is possible, because the counties most under-performing right now are Trump counties. His problem, most of them are very small, part of what Jonathan Martin called the Gingrich Counties (where Newt beat Romney)-- those rural places in-between all the big counties.</p> <p>All in all, the I-10 markets are way below where they should be, maybe as much as 3% below where its share should be. If that comes in tomorrow, it will tighten the race considerably.</p> <p>Tomorrow\u2019s memo will also lay out some things you watch for. If she wins by 3, we will know pretty well, probably before the Panhandle returns come back after 8. If it is close, prepare for a long night.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209c4ce4b07ceadb3a33c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:26:50.731Z\">3.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>She was 9 or 10 years old (depending on whether she falls in Aquarius-Leo or in Virgo-Capricorn) when the 19th amendment giving women the right to vote was ratified. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/1199SEIUFlorida/status/795367927285485569\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Desiline Victor, at 106 years old, is the oldest voter in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MiamiDade?src=hash\">#MiamiDade</a> arrives at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NorthMiami?src=hash\">#NorthMiami</a> to cast her vote <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeCareWeVote?src=hash\">#WeCareWeVote</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MobilizeFlorida?src=hash\">#MobilizeFlorida</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/PfPo7aeGRx\">pic.twitter.com/PfPo7aeGRx</a></p>&mdash; 1199SEIUFlorida (@1199SEIUFlorida) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1199SEIUFlorida/status/795367927285485569\">November 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209ab8e4b029b92ca464f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:18:06.012Z\">3.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hi Grandma, what are you doing today? </p> <p>Hillary Clinton has a granddaughter who just turned two, and a grandson who\u2019s five months. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"clinton\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:58.9932126697% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BMg3PI8AH2J/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hillary Clinton Facetimes with her granddaughter Charlotte on final morning of the campaign trail.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Sabrina Siddiqui (@sabrinasiddiqui) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-11-07T15:11:20+00:00&quot;&gt;Nov 7, 2016 at 7:11am PST&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209989e4b07ceadb3a33b1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:14:43.720Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Philly transit strike ends</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If voters in Philadelphia, prime Democratic territory, don\u2019t turn up at the polls tomorrow, they will not have a weeklong public transit strike to blame.

  "<p>To become the 45th president of the United States, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump has to win 270 electoral college votes. The candidates have spent what feels like 100 years locked in mortal combat, but in the next few hours there will finally be a victor. (Well, probably. If there\u2019s a 269-vote tie, or a mandatory recount, prepare for constitutional chaos.)</p> <h2>So remind me how the electoral college works again? </h2> <p>Each state is assigned a certain number of electoral votes, ultimately based on its population. California has the most, with 55. Seven states \u2013 Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming \u2013 have just three electoral votes. Washington DC gets three too.</p> <p>While there are 50 states in the US, most of these are \u201csafely\u201d Republican or Democrat. They vote the same way every time going back at least six elections. So the presidential election boils down to just a handful of \u201cswing states\u201d \u2013 the 10 or 11 states that have a recent history of selecting both Republicans and Democrats. </p> <p>This is why voters in places such as Ohio, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, Colorado and New Hampshire are subjected to a barrage of television advertising and campaign stops. It\u2019s also why you have not seen Clinton and Trump holding rallies in Louisiana (safely Republican) or Washington (safely Democratic).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59yvc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2849673\"            data-video-name=\"How does the US electoral college work? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian/Getty Images\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58136bc4e4b08d944ba4ba7a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028elect1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028elect1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028elect1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\">How does the US electoral college work?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Trump faces a much more difficult path to victory. He needs to win almost all of these swing states to become the next president, whereas if Clinton wins two or three, she wins the race. </p> <p>This is because Democrats start from a stronger position. There are 18 states plus DC that have voted for a Democrat for president in every election since 1992. That batch amounts to 242 electoral votes. There are only 13 states that have voted for a Republican in every election since 1992. Those states carry just 102 electoral votes.</p> <p>If Clinton simply wins all the states that have voted for her predecessors in the recent past, then adds Florida (which has 29 electoral votes), she is the next president. If she loses Florida but wins, say, Virginia and North Carolina, she will be the next president.</p> <p>Trump needs to hold on to all the historically Republican states, win states such as Georgia and Arizona \u2013 which are usually Republican but where he has struggled in the polls \u2013 and then win enough swing states to tip him over 270.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/poll-closings/\" data-alt=\"Poll closing times\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/poll-closings/\">Poll closing times</a> </figure>  <p><em>(For our international readers following along across Europe and beyond, a little light math for you ... in the UK, Ireland, Iceland and Portugal, add five hours to ET; anywhere else from Poland west, add six hours; in eastern Europe, add seven hours; Australia add 16 hours; and so on.) </em></p> <h2>6pm ET (5pm CT, 4pm MT, 3pm PT, 11pm GMT) \u2013 let\u2019s go!<br></h2> <p>Buckle in because now the real fun begins: polls close in eastern Kentucky and most of Indiana.

But Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have to worry about the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency. A nice way to toast \u2013 and mock, if you were minded to do so \u2013 the 70-year-old builder might be to mix up a <a href=\"http://www.liquor.com/articles/presidential-election-cocktails/\">\u201cThe Donald\u201d</a> cocktail as you settle in for the night.

Trump likes the Rolling Stones and played this song at his rallies. The Rolling Stones do not like Donald Trump, and asked him to stop. He didn\u2019t.</p> <h2>7pm ET (6pm CT, 5pm MT, 4pm PT, 12am GMT)</h2> <p>Voting ends in three key swing states: Virginia, Florida and New Hampshire (where a minimal number of polling stations may stay open until 8pm ET).<br></p> <p>Florida\u2019s 29 electoral college <a href=\" http://dos.myflorida.com/elections/for-voters/voting/election-day-voting/\">votes</a> have proved crucial in the recent past. Al Gore can tell you that. He narrowly lost the state \u2013 some still believe he actually won \u2013 and the election to George W Bush, despite winning the national popular vote. </p> <p>Away from the top of the ticket, Florida senator and one-time Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio is up for re-election. He has been running a bit ahead of Democrat Patrick Murphy in the polls. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who resigned as chair of the Democratic National Committee in July after leaked emails showed the party favoring Clinton\u2019s campaign, is expected to comfortably win re-election to Congress.</p> <p>Virginia was a reliably Republican state until Obama won there in 2008 and again in 2012. The state\u2019s mix of less-educated, rural voters; wealthy suburbanites; federal government employees and military families; academics; jet-setters and so on make it difficult to read, but Clinton has been decisively ahead this year. </p> <p>New Hampshire has been won by a Democrat in five of the past six presidential elections. But the Granite State gave Trump his first big primary win, and recent polling here has shown a tight race.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d26348a1118b4b39b2fd0263b5f76c785aaa2311\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d26348a1118b4b39b2fd0263b5f76c785aaa2311/0_0_1472_5321/277.png\" alt=\"Spicy Hot Sauce\" width=\"277\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spice things up</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erickson Photography/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other states closing at 7pm ET include South Carolina and Vermont \u2013 Bernie Sanders\u2019 home state.

Expect the result from West Virginia very quickly \u2013 Trump should win easily. </p> <p>North Carolina and Ohio are swing states and will take longer. Ohio has been seen as a reliable bellwether state, voting for the presidential winner in every election since 1964. That run might be coming to an end, however, either <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/political_commentary/commentary_by_kyle_kondik/why_trump_will_do_better_in_ohio_than_he_does_nationally\">because of the state\u2019s changing demographics</a> or because of the strangeness of the current contest, in terms of the unfavorability of both candidates. </p> <p>While its demographics are complicated \u2013 a mix of Rust Belt, big cities, Appalachia, farmland and more \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/us/politics/ohio-campaign-trump-clinton.html\">Ohio electorate</a> has grown more white and less educated than the national mean. That trend appears to account in part for Trump\u2019s strength in the Buckeye State this year.</p> <p><strong>Election soundtrack: </strong>The Pretenders, Message of Love. Because Chrissie Hynde is was born in Akron, Ohio. You could also make a point about spreading a message of love. Or of someone pretending to spread a message of love. Not that we\u2019re questioning, in any way at all, how much politicians love the voters.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>8pm ET (7pm CT, 6pm MT, 5pm PT, 1am GMT)</h2> <p>In 2012, the Associated Press called the Indiana result just before 8pm. Vigo County, which borders Illinois in west Indiana, is seen as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/portrait-bellwether-indiana-county-has-history-picking-presidents#slide1\">the ultimate bellwether</a>. It has voted for the winner of every presidential election in 30 of the past 32 elections \u2013 dating back to 1888. Keep an eye out for its result.</p> <p>A big swing state closes its polls at 8pm: Pennsylvania.</p> <p>Republicans have long dreamed of winning Pennsylvania\u2019s 20 electoral college votes, based on growing support among once flourishing manufacturing and mining sectors in the south-western and north-eastern corners of the state. But Clinton has been creaming Trump in polls in Philadelphia and its suburbs, which is where most of the people live, and she has been comfortably ahead in statewide polls for months. </p> <p>Pennsylvania will also be under scrutiny on election day because of Trump\u2019s controversial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/donald-trump-rigged-election-poll-giuliani-gingrich-pence\">claims</a> that there has been voter fraud in Philadelphia in the past and his calls for \u201cvolunteer election monitors\u201d.</p> <p>The results in non-swing states will start to come in thick and fast. Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey and Rhode Island all close at 8pm ET, and we can expect AP to call all these states pretty much immediately.</p> <p>Maine\u2019s polls also close at 8pm. It is one of only two states \u2013 the other is Nebraska, where voting finishes at 9pm \u2013 that splits its electoral votes <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/22/politics/electoral-college-split-votes-maine-nebraska-proportional/\">according to congressional district</a>.</p> <p>The state as a whole is likely to vote Democrat, but Trump may steal an electoral vote in Maine\u2019s second district, which is made up of more rural voters.</p> <p><strong>Election fuel:</strong> There\u2019s a whole \u201cChefs for Hillary\u201d page <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?rs=ac&amp;len=2&amp;q=chefs%20for%20hillary&amp;etslf=4171&amp;eq=chefs%20for%20hilla&amp;term_meta[]=chefs%20for%20hillary%7Cautocomplete%7C\">on Pinterest</a>, a tribute to Clinton\u2019s attempts to win the foodie vote. <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/554716879086195985/\">One of the recipes is provided by John Podesta</a>, the chairman of Clinton\u2019s campaign.

In the 2012 election, Mitt Romney was declared the winner just before 8.30pm. A Democratic candidate hasn\u2019t won in Georgia since proper southern boy Bill Clinton in 1992, but strong support for Hillary Clinton in Georgia counties with a high African American population, and in Atlanta, have made her a threat to Trump. </p> <p>If Clinton wins Georgia, Trump might as well concede. (Don\u2019t hold your breath.)</p> <p><strong>Election tunes: </strong>Marvin Gaye, Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler). The African American vote is in, and Trump gets a big 1%.</p> <h2>9pm ET (8pm CT, 7pm MT, 6pm PT, 2am GMT)</h2> <p>Polls close in two traditional swing states: Wisconsin and Colorado, and in Arizona, which is usually firmly Republican but is swingy this year.<br></p> <p>An increasingly influential Hispanic bloc and Mormons who can\u2019t stand Trump \u2013 not to mention a superior Democratic ground game \u2013 mean that Clinton has a decent chance of becoming the first Democrat to win Arizona since her husband in 1996.</p> <p>When the polls close in New York, at 9pm ET, they will have been open for 15 hours \u2013 the longest polling window of any state. Barring an almighty upset, Clinton will quickly be declared the winner.</p> <p>Wyoming, Louisiana, North and South Dakota, Kansas and Texas all close at 9pm too. The networks should swiftly call these for Trump \u2026 unless loose talk of Clinton taking Texas, which last went Democratic in the Watergate era, comes true? If it\u2019s that kind of night, water the horses and go to town.</p> <p>Nebraska, which like Maine splits its electoral votes by <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/22/politics/electoral-college-split-votes-maine-nebraska-proportional/\">congressional district</a>, shuts its polls at 9pm ET. Barack Obama won Nebraska\u2019s second district \u2013 Omaha \u2013 in 2008. Clinton could do the same this year, thanks to a well-financed get-out-the-vote effort spearheaded by Susan Buffett, daughter of Warren. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8edfd50af2c072354a729c7babe3cd48a3ecacea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8edfd50af2c072354a729c7babe3cd48a3ecacea/0_0_2261_2097/1000.png\" alt=\"Slice of plain cheesecake\" width=\"1000\" height=\"927\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Election fuel:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.food.com/recipe/new-york-cheesecake-57025\">New York cheesecake</a>. Hillary Clinton was born in Chicago but was a senator from New York for eight years. Donald Trump was born in Queens, New York, before inheriting his father\u2019s successful real estate business. In January, Trump claimed his popularity was such that he could \u201cstand in the middle of Fifth Avenue [in New York City] and shoot somebody\u201d without losing voters. Trump <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ny/new_york_trump_vs_clinton-5792.html\">has been trailing</a> Clinton by 20% in New York.</p> <p><strong>Election soundtrack:</strong> Fleetwood Mac, Silver Springs. \u201cI know I could\u2019ve loved you, but you would not let me,\u201d laments Arizona\u2019s Stevie Nicks. Might Trump be thinking the same thing when the Grand Canyon State\u2019s results come in?</p> <h2>10pm ET (9pm CT, 8pm MT, 7pm PT, 3am GMT)</h2> <p>Given Clinton\u2019s apparent strength in Pennsylvania, we may see the state called for her by 10pm (or, in a deeply troubling upset for her, Trump may win). The New Hampshire result should also come in around this time. They will offer one of the first concrete indications of how the night is going.</p> <p>Nevada and Iowa are the final swing states to close their polls. In the past two elections, Iowa was called quickly for Obama. Montana and Utah also close at 10pm; both are traditionally safe Republican states, but Trump\u2019s unpopularity means <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-24/mormon-support-could-push-mcmullin-over-the-top-in-utah\">independent Evan McMullin</a>, who\u2019s from Utah, has a strong chance of becoming the first non-Republican or Democrat to win electoral college votes since 1968. </p> <p>Utah has been called soon after the polls close in the recent past. If McMullin is declared the winner, it\u2019s a good sign that the night is truly in uncharted territory, terra incognita, in the most exciting way. Former congressional staffer Evan McMullin: buckle up, America.</p> <p><strong>More election drinking:</strong> Yuengling brewery \u2013 the oldest brewery in the US \u2013 is based in Pennsylvania. Its owner <a href=\"http://www.phillyvoice.com/beer-drinkers-disavow-yuengling-after-owner-shows-support-for-trump/\">came out in support of Trump</a> in October, a move which has seen some drinkers boycotting the beer. You could however source some craft ale from the <a href=\"http://www.victorybeer.com/\">Victory Brewing Company</a>, also based in Pennsylvania.

These are all safe Democrat states that are unlikely to unexpectedly impact the outcome. </p> <p>Back in 2012, the Associated Press called the swing states of Colorado, Iowa, North Carolina and Ohio \u2013 worth a combined 48 electoral votes \u2013 in the space of 30 minutes at around 11pm, then declared Obama\u2019s re-election at 11.38pm. </p> <p>In 2008, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73ksUPU0Nbo\">networks announced</a> Obama had won just after 11pm.</p> <p>We might know the outcome sooner this time. Or we might not know for a while.</p> <p>If Clinton\u2019s lead in opinion polls translates to the actual polls, then we may see states called for her earlier, on the back of strong early voting results. If enough swing states are called quickly, we could find out the result before 11pm ET. Or, if Trump proves the polls wrong, the race could as quickly run to him.</p> <p>Separately, there are some individual states to look out for.</p> <p>Ohio is one. Some polling experts believe that if Trump doesn\u2019t win there, it is effectively game over. <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/if-trump-wins-heres-how-the-map-might-look/?ex_cid=538twitter\">Fivethirtyeight.com gave him</a> less than a 1% chance of winning the presidency if he fails to take the Buckeye State.</p> <p>Likewise, if Trump loses North Carolina or Pennsylvania or Florida, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/most-routes-to-270-blocked-for-trump-needs-last-ditch-surge/2016/10/30/b3cf409a-9ede-11e6-8864-6f892cad0865_story.html\">it also becomes very difficult</a> for him to win.</p> <p>And beyond that, if Clinton can win Georgia \u2013 remember, these are usually solidly Republican \u2013 it would suggest she is in for a blowout victory that could see the election called for her very early.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"100102cda2684f749441d7cb80e7b29f4e29d579\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/100102cda2684f749441d7cb80e7b29f4e29d579/0_0_1197_3576/335.png\" alt=\"Queen Latifah\" width=\"335\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queen Latifah</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Toth/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2012, Virginia was only called for Obama after midnight and Florida was not called for four days.

We may see the first female president, following a campaign marked by sexism and inappropriate behaviour towards women. Queen Latifah called out the disrespectful treatment of women in this 1994 hit.</p> <p><strong>Election fuel: </strong><a href=\"http://www.chowhound.com/recipes/cuban-sandwiches-30428\">Cuban sandwich</a>. Florida\u2019s signature dish is said to have originated in Cuba or in Key West, part of the Florida Keys archipelago. It\u2019s got ham, swiss cheese, mustard and pickles in it, and might be a good way to soak up the booze.</p> <h2>Time for the the speeches?</h2> <p>In the early hours, we would expect a victory speech and a concession speech \u2013though Trump has spoken of a threat that the election could be rigged and refused to say that if he loses he will accept the result. </p> <p>If elected, Clinton would be the first woman to be elected US president. She has <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-glass-ceiling_us_579827fee4b0d3568f85272e\">repeatedly spoken</a> about breaking the \u201cglass ceiling\u201d in politics, and has chosen to hold her election night party at New York City\u2019s Javits Center, which <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/26/politics/hillary-clinton-election-night-javits-center-irpt/\">actually has a glass ceiling</a>.</p> <p>If Trump is elected, he will be the first person with his own vodka line to be elected president, and <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/252557-how-often-do-americans-elect-political-outsiders-to\">only the fifth</a> president to have never held elected office. </p> <p>The winner will have 73 days to set up a new government before they are sworn into office on 20 January 2017.</p> <p>But if you\u2019re concerned about post-election withdrawal symptoms, don\u2019t worry: the midterm elections, sometimes seen as a referendum on the president, will take place in November 2018. All 435 members of the House of Representatives will be up for re-election, along with a third of the Senate and more than half the governors.</p> <p>And then, in summer 2019, a whole new cast of hopefuls will announce their presidential campaigns, and the whole thing starts over again.

  "<p>Frank Archambault is not going to vote for president. </p> <p>In mid-July, the 45-year-old member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe packed up all of his belongs and his family \u2013 five children and a grandson \u2013 to travel from Little Eagle, South Dakota, to Cannon Ball, North Dakota, to join the movement of \u201cwater protecters\u201d facing off against the federal government and the oil industry.

Generations of war, massacres, broken treaties, discrimination, police harassment, and poverty have resulted in a general feeling of distrust, disillusion, and disinterest in mainstream politics among the Native Americans gathered at Standing Rock. And historical traumas have only been compounded by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/dakota-access-pipeline-native-american-protesters\">militarized police response</a> to unarmed protesters, who have been met with Mace, rubber bullets, Tasers and sound weapons. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3da547d142a32bae22dd8397c0441c90ab55e8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3da547d142a32bae22dd8397c0441c90ab55e8b/0_115_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Archambault: \u2018I don\u2019t have faith in government, so I don\u2019t want to have a say.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Archambault: \u2018I don\u2019t have faith in government, so I don\u2019t want to have a say.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julia Carrie Wong/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone here votes,\u201d said Julie Richards, an Oglala Lakota from Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. \u201cWe\u2019re all like, fuck the government, fuck voting, and fuck the people running.\u201d </p> <p>The rest of the nation may be glued to cable news and the latest polls, anxious for the uncertain future of an unusual election.

  "<p>In the moments that Infinite Warfare has the courage of its convictions, when its various systems sync-up sufficiently, we get a tantalising taste of its true potential.</p> <p>These moments usually come when the protagonist, Nick Reyes, leaves terra firma and zips about in zero-gravity, course-correcting with boosters and engaging enemy soldiers against the backdrop of gargantuan spaceships smashing into one another. In between precision shots from his Ghostbusters-like energy weapon, he grapples on to a grunt and pulls the pin on his grenade before kicking him towards two buddies, who look on helplessly as he greets them with an explosion. That taken care of, Reyes grapples to his waiting Jackal space fighter and boosts off to begin dogfighting with enemy craft. </p> <p>Needless to say, Call of Duty\u2019s production values ensure such episodes look spectacular. They may not be perfect in execution \u2013 rotation can become disorientating and enemy AI remains erratic \u2013 but they at least attempt to jolt this long-running series off its sometimes derided rails. Disappointingly though, Infinity Ward\u2019s latest offering is mostly the familiar CoD routine of boots-on-the-ground combat in long corridors of choreographed action. It\u2019s just that here, those boots are rocket-boosted and wall-run-capable. Even this concept is a pale imitation of Titanfall at its finest, boasting similar fundamentals but not the conviction to make them integral. While traversing these familiar sci-fi environments \u2013 futuristic cityscape, ice planet, rock planet, space station \u2013 parkour is mostly unnecessary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"766a8f0af0e9fdb986a0f00af8de02120ce8d85a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/766a8f0af0e9fdb986a0f00af8de02120ce8d85a/242_0_3598_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Developer Infinity Ward really wants us to care about its characters but doesn\u2019t give us enough narrative ammo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Developer Infinity Ward really wants us to care about its characters but doesn\u2019t give us enough narrative ammo</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Activision</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The old problem of this game\u2019s key narrative delivery technique remains: you have to follow computer-controlled characters who yell orders and exposition at you, but often they move too slow and it gets frustrating \u2013 like attempting to navigate Oxford Street on a particularly chaotic festive shopping day. The sheer number of times the game strips control away from you remains extraordinary \u2013 after a while, even the most impressive cinematic moments become a deadening intrusion. The first time you\u2019re blasted out of an airlock it\u2019s inarguably impressive and it even feels appropriate that you\u2019re helpless. The second time is simply irritating. The third time, you just want to drift away forever like Frank Poole in 2001: A Space Odyssey. </p> <p>But even in space, you lack freedom. Attempts to flank the enemy are thwarted by a curt prompt to return to the \u201ccombat zone\u201d or be booted. The space craft combat sequences are a mess. The physics lack heft and movement feels erratic. Opposing fighters are simple to lock on to but the game then wrests control away to track them. Occasionally, when you kill an enemy, a playing card will pop up to tell you he was a big cheese (in an imitation of the American ploy towards rogue Ba\u2019athists in 2003), but since you only find this out after killing them it renders the whole scheme somewhat pointless. You shot them just the same as all the others; that\u2019s all you do in CoD.</p> <p>Much is made of the fact you\u2019re a captain but you can\u2019t issue orders in the field and, despite a Mass Effect-like galaxy map to navigate on your ship\u2019s bridge, you cannot shape the campaign\u2019s outcome. You can select two types of side-mission \u2013 ship-infiltration or ship-to-ship combat \u2013 but the benefit of them is merely upgraded equipment. It\u2019s certainly no Mass Effect in this respect \u2013 and while that comparison is harsh, it\u2019s conditioned by the developer\u2019s flagrant desire for you to care about your mission and crew; the message about prioritising one over the other crowbarred into every conversation.</p> <p>The setting at least allows the game to sidestep CoD\u2019s traditionally problematic politics, even if the opening sneak-attack on Geneva subtly nods towards Pearl Harbour and 9/11. Not being offensive shouldn\u2019t be praiseworthy, however, and the Martian secessionists led by Salen Kotch (a space-scenery-chewing Kit Harington) are so comically evil, and your means for defeating them so silly, they undermine any questions about military service the game attempts to tackle.</p> <p>The defeat of the villain is woefully anticlimactic, whereas the finale has dramatic deaths for minor crew members you\u2019d barely noticed hitherto. While the credits roll you can listen to letters from the fallen, meant to sum up the series\u2019 earnest move away from \u201cpress x to show respects\u201d miss-steps. Instead, they bring to mind the deliberately ridiculous barbecue dream of BJ Blazkowicz in the last Wolfenstein. The characters here lack the script to justify you caring. The damning irony is only wisecracking robot Ethan sounds remotely human.</p> <p>For all these flaws, CoD\u2019s core shooting mechanics, refined over countless iterations, still make for a fine corridor and multiplayer shooter. Every weapon comes with alternative fire modes and being creative in your kills is part of the appeal. Innovations such as anti-grav grenades and spider bots (which scuttle over to enemies before discharging) spice things up, not least when they\u2019re deployed against you. One of the most enjoyable new tactics in the campaign is the ability to take direct control of enemy bots by hacking them, unleashing rounds on their bewildered allies before detonating to take as many with you as you can.</p> <p>After completing the game, you can replay the whole thing in modes like Yolo, which offers a challenging permadeath mechanic that encourages a whole different approach (ie a lot of hiding).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a3f272c412c77bddbbfe203e9ff0ef2d6e6e3e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a3f272c412c77bddbbfe203e9ff0ef2d6e6e3e8/0_0_3598_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Infinite Warfare really comes into its own as a multiplayer experience\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Infinite Warfare really comes into its own as a multiplayer experience</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Activision</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The online multiplayer modes are the best thing. The campaign\u2019s traversal mechanics come out of hiding and the wealth of options become apparent. Whether you\u2019re angling for nuts and bolts deathmatch on a lunch break, or something more substantial, CoD remains a silly, slick and intuitive shooter that sucks you in and keeps you there. The ready-built combat rigs cater to different play styles so you can instantly pick the right loadout, whether you like to snipe or stab.</p> <p>For the first time there\u2019s weapon crafting, too, and a conscious effort to reward players for attempting different match-types, not to mention a neat 1980s theme park reboot of zombie survival. Prototype weapons are the strongest in the game \u2013 graded common to epic \u2013 and you obtain them by earning salvage as you play or completing challenges with one of four mission teams. The holy grail is a gun that provides a nuclear blast if you can string together 25 kills.</p> <p>Crucially, such objectives are optional and there\u2019s no chance of the camera being yanked-away as you complete them. Infinite Warfare improves online because the game doesn\u2019t dictate your experiences precisely as the developers intended. In many ways the campaign feels like a wrestling match between your game and theirs, perhaps a mirroring of their attempt to innovate within the constraints of the CoD franchise behemoth. But this doesn\u2019t excuse a forgettable plot or inferior fighting to its triple-A peers. Infinite Warfare could have been much more than a passable single-player movie attached to a super fast, super confident multiplayer infrastructure. As such, and with those moments of tantalising potential in mind, it feels like a wasted opportunity.</p> <p><strong>Activision; PC/PS4/Xbox One (version tested); \u00a350; Pegi rating: 18+</strong></p>",
  "<p>Many of us have been stuck in a Brexistential crisis since June. Uncertainty over if, whether and how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article-50\">article 50 will be triggered</a> only sharpens our distrust of political leaders, and ever more hyperbolic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/04/labour-condemns-newspaper-attacks-on-judges-after-brexit-ruling\">rabble-rousing headlines</a> appear now on a daily basis. We face another looming worry: the possibility of a Donald Trump victory in the US. Like Princess Diana\u2019s death or 9/11, these are world events that we struggle to compute. They are absolutely real yet seem strangely unreal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/07/what-happens-after-clinton-trump-win-election-progressive\">Whether Trump or Clinton wins the US election, what follows is up to us | Rebecca Solnit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both Brexit and the US election raise questions about borders and identity, which trigger primitive and personal anxieties about the breaching of the boundary between inside and outside, provoking associations with the body. For example, there\u2019s the idea that the national border, our collective \u201cskin\u201d, might collapse, and that we might face annihilation. Or that we have something so precious that others wish to take us over, to invade us and steal this. A leader who promises to protect the boundary of inside and outside can thus have a special allure, as history shows. Hence the appeal of a Trump, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/07/donald-trump-presidency-america-endure-latinos-experience\">his Mexico-US wall</a> and his evocation of the \u201cTrojan horse\u201d of immigration. These images might seem laughable to many, but they touch on people\u2019s basic anxieties about boundaries.</p> <p>The supreme certitude and confidence of such leaders gains a particular power when the world feels so tenuous, fragile and uncertain. Our changing relationship to expertise, evidence and traditional hierarchical structures leaves a dreadful vacuum. We haven\u2019t really established any new forms of political organisation in their place. This is partly because new forms of organisation are quickly ridiculed as we struggle between old and new. And partly because at some level we take for granted that things can\u2019t and won\u2019t change.</p> <p>Yet, ambivalent as we so often are, we also yearn for change. The presumption that we wish to maintain the status quo forecloses our perhaps more covert desire to shake things up, turn over the apple cart, to see what happens. When these sometimes destructive whims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/meriden-brexit-leave-regret-doubts-linger-eu-referendum\">turn into a reality</a> it can be all the more unsettling, as seen in the numbers of Bregrexit voters who didn\u2019t think their vote would really count, or people who secretly want a Trump victory to see what happens. Even the philosopher Slavoj Zi\u017eek says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/794232437337247744\">he would vote for Trump</a> for precisely this reason.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-650-million-people-week-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5a5j5\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2858198\"            data-video-name=\"Trump: Clinton would let 650 million people into US in one week \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Pool\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58171544e4b08d944ba4c889\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/31/161031TrumpImmigrationClaim2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/31/161031TrumpImmigrationClaim2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/31/161031TrumpImmigrationClaim2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-650-million-people-week-video\">Trump: Clinton would let 650 million people into US in one week</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>We like to ridicule such voters to assure ourselves that we act rationally, that we want the sensible, fair solution. But of course we all vote from a transitional space between reality and fantasy, influenced by pulls and pushes based on our background, and the histories of generations before us that have been transmitted to us both consciously and unconsciously.</p> <p>The reaction to this year\u2019s votes show a fundamental lack of curiosity, an increasing intolerance for other people\u2019s attitudes and ideals. People who vote for Clinton, Trump, leave, remain all believe in their position, and most will have constructed an internal logic to justify it. We must make the effort here to humanise the other by trying to find out, gently, about this logic, or we become ourselves the creators of Trump\u2019s dividing wall.</p> <p>In the face of such uncertainty, it is perhaps no surprise that experts are brought in to instruct us on how to cope. The advice tends to be quite simple. Limit your social media. Meditate. Connect with friends. Go out into nature. And, as the American Psychological Association (APA) recommends, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2016/10/presidential-election-stress.aspx\">avoid catastrophising, and maintain a balanced perspective</a>\u201d. These suggestions are both vaguely useful and patently ridiculous, and they serve to depoliticise our situation. In their own way, they reinforce a split between inside and outside, as if it were sane to focus on inner peace when Rome is burning.</p> <p>We need instead to remember the transformative potential of emotion. Uncertainty and fear can be a means to recognise the intimate, mutual relationship between our inner lives and outer political realities. Rather than aiming to stay calm, is it not time to remember that emotion has always been the fuel for collective action, social justice movements and political change? Advice on how to cope through techniques of self-management, here, can interfere dangerously with what our bodies are cueing us to do.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps we can find inspiration instead in those who suffered trauma and tried to do something with it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps we can find inspiration instead in those who suffered trauma and tried to do something with it. I spent last weekend at a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MHWelfareReform?src=hash\">welfare reform</a> conference where we were greeted by a banner with the names of those who had died as a result of benefits sanctions carefully embroidered on it. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/22magoo\">Maggie Zolobajluk</a> and her allies had put love, grief, tears and passion into this creation.</p> <p>My heroes are not politicians but exceptional people such as Zolobajluk who, when a tragedy has occurred, manage to find the political drive to create something new, to try to make sure that nothing similar ever happens again.</p> <p>Here Zi\u017eek has a point. If Clinton wins, if things seem to be stabilising, we risk becoming complacent again, and losing the transformative potential of the emotions we now feel. We must resist this false calm, for it would reduce us to being subject once more to the forces that have created the current crises. Rather, we must surely use our feelings to charge us to create forms of organisation and resistance that, like Zolobajluk\u2019s banner, bear crucial messages. A breakdown, after all, always carries within it the seeds of a breakthrough if we take it seriously, and act accordingly.</p>",

  "<p>Jeremy Clarkson has described plans to make the BBC reveal the pay of stars who earn more than \u00a3150,000 as disgusting, saying management should be trusted to pay enough to keep them from joining commercial rivals.</p> <p>Asked about his earnings from new Amazon show The Grand Tour, which reportedly cost \u00a3160m for three series, Clarkson lashed out at those he said were \u201cobsessed with money\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTake the business of BBC talent. What country are we living in when we want to know how much people are paid? It\u2019s disgusting,\u201d he told the Radio Times.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tony Hall\u2019s job, as the director general [of the BBC], to say, \u2018We\u2019re going to pay that person that much,\u2019 and if we trust Tony Hall, and we must, because he\u2019s the director general, then you trust him to be doing a good job. You can\u2019t be saying to him, \u2018Why are you paying him that?\u2019 Because if you don\u2019t, he\u2019ll go to ITV. It\u2019s absolutely ludicrous.\u201d</p> <p>Until he was dropped last year from Top Gear after allegedly assaulting a producer, Clarkson was on one of the largest salaries at the BBC, thought to be around \u00a31m a year. </p> <p>He had also earned millions in dividends from Bedder 6, the company he formed with long-time production partner Andy Wilman, which exploited the Top Gear brand globally. In 2014 the pair sold their stakes in the company to existing shareholder BBC Worldwide, the corporation\u2019s commercial arm, taking Clarkson\u2019s total earnings for the year to more than \u00a314m.</p> <p>His short-lived replacement on the last series of Top Gear, Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans, is thought to be one of those stars who will have their pay revealed from next year. The government originally said the threshold would be set at \u00a3450,000, but shortly after taking over as culture secretary this summer, Karen Bradley said the figure should be lower.</p> <p>Clarkson said he wished the BBC would occasionally tell its critics to \u201ceff-off\u201d, adding: \u201cI will do it on their behalf if they like.\u201d However, he renewed his attacks on the former BBC director of TV whom he appears to blame for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/25/jeremy-clarkson-top-gear-contract-bbc\">departure from Top Gear</a>, Danny Cohen.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody thinks that the BBC was a bloody nightmare. It wasn\u2019t. Cohen was,\u201d said Clarkson. \u201cThe BBC was brilliant to work for until the arrival of Mr Cohen. They never really interfered at all. But he was a bloody nuisance and caused me an enormous amount of stress.\u201d</p> <p>Cohen, whose credits during his BBC career include Call the Midwife, Poldark and Happy Valley, left the BBC in November last year and is now head of media investment company Access Entertainment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I look back at Top Gear Wikipedia section marked 'controversy', Mexico is the one where we definitely got it wrong</p> <footer> <cite>Jeremy Clarkson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clarkson has been bullish in defending himself from accusations of bigotry. However, he said an incident when he and Top Gear co-stars Richard Hammond and James May made a series of remarks about Mexicans was one \u201cwhere we definitely got it wrong\u201d. </p> <p>He said that following the segment on Top Gear that included Hammond calling Mexicans \u201cfeckless, flatulent and lazy\u201d and a suggestion the Mexican ambassador would be too lazy to complain, the trio had apologised. </p> <p>\u201cGenuinely, if I look back at all the Top Gear Wikipedia section marked \u2018controversy\u2019, then Mexico is the one where we definitely got it wrong. I went to see the Mexican ambassador and apologised to him. I didn\u2019t have to, the Beeb didn\u2019t tell me to, but it was out of order. </p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re writing thousands and thousands of words and doing hours and hours of television, then occasionally you will tread on a landmine. So we went down and said we were really sorry and got absolutely paralytic on tequila with him. That was a good day.\u201d</p> <p>Clarkson and co have also been accused of homophobia, sexism and other forms of racism, including one incident where Clarkson used the derogatory term \u201cslope\u201d about an Asian man during a segment filmed in Burma and another when he appeared to use the n-word during a rhyme in un-broadcast footage, which prompted the final warning from Cohen.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/damilola-taylor\">Damilola Taylor</a> would be 26 now. Doing what, I wonder? Playing for Manchester United perhaps, as he once told his father he would.

Then Damilola himself is begging his dad, Richard, to go, sulking one minute, showing off his knowledge of Great Britain the next. And we the viewer are begging his father not to let him go, as if it is somehow possible to change what happened. Come on, Mr Taylor, are you going to cave to your 10-year-old child?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/07/our-loved-boy-damilola-taylor-murder-bbc\">Damilola, Our Loved Boy \u2013 the 16 years of agony behind one boy's shocking death</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And what about immigration \u2013 are they just going to let them in?

Oh God, the coat, the silver one, from the haunting CCTV footage. Is it really 16 years ago? I remember it so clearly. Here the coat takes on extra significance and poignancy; it confirms the worst for Gloria, desperately searching the North Peckham estate when her boy hasn\u2019t come home, accompanied by the wail of police sirens. The victim, she overhears on a police radio, was wearing school uniform and a silver jacket. Later it will become a pawn in the blame game; Richard reprimands his wife for buying such a bright, visible, ostentatious coat.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/07/our-loved-boy-damilola-taylor-murder-bbc\">Levi David Addai\u2019s quietly powerful, affecting drama</a> doesn\u2019t dwell on Damilola\u2019s death. The film leaves him, at the point of that CCTV image, skipping home from computer club at Peckham library in his silver coat, on that November afternoon. Richard, when he arrives, wants to see the bleak concrete stairwell his boy managed to struggle to before collapsing. \u201cIs this where my son died?\u201d he shouts.</p> <p>Then it\u2019s about the Taylors\u2019 search, and fight, for justice \u2013 and what happens to a family when the unthinkable happens. (Perhaps selfishly, it makes you think about how your own family would, or wouldn\u2019t, come through something like this.) It\u2019s beautifully performed: by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2148911/\">Wunmi Mosaku</a> as Gloria, quietly torn to pieces inside. By <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm8339076/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\">Juwon Adedokun</a> as Damilola\u2019s elder brother, Tunde, beating himself up for not being there to pick up his little brother and bring him home safely. And especially by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1959501/\">Babou Ceesay</a> as Richard Taylor, a complex character, righteous disciplinarian and family man. He blames everyone: Tunde, Gloria, the coat, Peckham, the country, and \u2013 eventually \u2013 himself. The real Richard Taylor was involved with and consulted over the film, but that doesn\u2019t mean he gets an easy ride. A memorable performance and portrait of a difficult, proud man consumed by anger and grief.</p> <p>It\u2019s desperately, desperately sad, of course. I was choked up pretty much throughout. And it\u2019s hard not to feel some sense of national shame that this senseless tragedy happened to a lovely, cheeky boy, with a big smile and some silky soccer skills, before he reached his 11th birthday (shout-out, too, to newcomer and <a href=\"http://filmfixer.co.uk/2016/10/31/lambeth-star-lewisham-writer-southwarks-painful-story/\">Lambeth schoolboy Sammy Kamara</a>, who plays Damilola).</p> <p>There is some sort of consolation. Manslaughter convictions, eventually; graduation for Tunde; the family somehow remains together, until Gloria\u2019s death. And Richard continues to work with young people, campaigning against violence in the name of his son.</p>",

But without the numbers, the Greens amendment will not pass.</p> <p>So the Greens will support the crossbench/Labor amendment for a 10.5% backpacker tax.</p> <p>The treasurer, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, has said if the bill is amended, the government will knock it off in the lower house.</p> <p>Which means it will be status quo. Or will it?</p> <p>Morrison says in the absence of the changes, the default tax will be 32.5% \u2013 which was what the Abbott government originally proposed in 2015 (where it all started).</p> <p>Whish-Wilson was claiming the win, no matter what happens.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Greens have led on this issue. We were the first party to oppose the backpacker tax. We were the only one to take a costed policy to the election. We were the ones who discovered legislation was required and that the automatic default is not 32.5%.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now the default position of the tax is complicated. The key thing to remember is that though the Abbott government originally proposed the tax in 2015, this has been argued about ever since. No backpacker legislation has passed the house since then.</p> <p>That means there is no change to the existing position. </p> <p>Which means some backpackers will continue to qualify as residents for tax purposes, getting a lesser rate. And some will continue to qualify as non-residents, getting a higher rate.</p> <p>Whish-Wilson:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Barnaby Joyce</strong> is talking bulldust that a default rate of 32.5% will start on January 1 2017. The only thing due to come in on January 1 was the government\u2019s law if their legislation passed both houses of parliament. If the legislation fails to pass then the status quo remains unchanged, that is some backpackers are treated as residents, and some are not.</p> <p>Tasmanian farmers, at an individual level, have told me they want this bill dead. They will never trust the government again. Barnaby Joyce did not even visit Tasmania during this debate. He has done nothing to fix the mess his government created.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T06:14:25.729Z\">at 6.14am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58215a92e4b029b92ca467c6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T04:55:48.708Z\">4.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>No props. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57b67cb75c0881dd91c5a70460f48f1d5be95ad9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57b67cb75c0881dd91c5a70460f48f1d5be95ad9/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Opposition deputy leader Tanya Plibersek leads a visual taunt with members holding up a photograph of former senator Bob Day with education minister Simon Birmingham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Opposition deputy leader Tanya Plibersek leads a visual taunt with members holding up a photograph of former senator Bob Day with education minister Simon Birmingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Labor loses the right to ask a question by using props.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58215879e4b07ceadb3a367d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T04:53:33.353Z\">4.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Just to keep you going ... the Senate committee report into the attorney general <strong>George Brandis\u2019s </strong>legal direction to the solicitor general <strong>Justin Gleeson</strong> will be tabled tonight about 5pm.</p> <p>That was the committee that saw fiery exchanges between Gleeson and the LNP senator <strong>Ian Macdonald </strong>and in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/14/gleeson-says-he-ignored-invalid-direction-from-brandis-to-seek-consent\">Gleeson admitted he considered the Brandis direction invalid</a>.

Xenophon says he has told the government the NXT bloc will look at the <strong>forever ban proposal</strong> but this is a \u201cconscience issue\u201d for his parliamentarians. By this he means the <strong>NXT bloc may split on this issue</strong>. In any case, they are not yet set in stone about which way to go. Xenophon is sounding relaxed about his people voting in different ways on this proposal.</p> <p>In terms of Labor\u2019s decision this morning to reject the proposal, here\u2019s a <strong>couple of quick analytical thoughts</strong>.</p> <p>It\u2019s been obvious for a little while that the government\u2019s drive-by attacks on Labor on the boats don\u2019t resonate politically quite as much as they used to. It could be because the boats have stopped, voters are no longer so fixated on unauthorised arrivals making their way south.</p> <p>This trajectory did happen during the Howard years, voters were fixated on the problem (aided by a government telling them constantly it was a problem), but once the \u201cproblem\u201d was \u201cfixed\u201d, it was actually an electoral plus for <strong>Kevin Rudd </strong>in 2007, when he went to the election promising to wind back the punitive \u201cPacific solution\u201d.<br></p> <p>So perhaps it\u2019s just a case of the politics being moderately less toxic. Labor is certainly less worried than it used to be about standing up to the government on border protection, and the new shadow immigration spokesman, <strong>Shayne Neumann</strong>, has set quite a different tone in the portfolio to his predecessor, <strong>Richard Marles</strong>.</p> <p>But I also think there was <strong>no way on God\u2019s earth that the left faction would have supported this latest policy foray by the government</strong>. I suspect Shorten, the leadership group, and the shadow cabinet knew that. It would have been fraught if Shorten had insisted on exercising a bit of \u201cme too-ism\u201d on the government\u2019s proposal. Hence today\u2019s result.

A few months later he was transferred to Nauru via Darwin, and has since been granted refugee status.</p> <p>The government argues its offshore processing policy \u2013 which has seen a dramatic reduction in asylum seekers vessels reaching Australia \u2013 discourages people from making dangerous journeys, and undermines the business model of people smugglers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an illegal boat,\u201d he told Guardian Australia from Nauru. \u201cYou can\u2019t get on a cruise ship if you don\u2019t have a visa. It is a legal boat.</p> <p>\u201cI came here because I have a problem,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He has since returned to Australia on three occasions for medical treatment, each time sent back without warning, but he said Friday\u2019s deportation was the worst instance, as he was restrained and prevented from contacting his lawyer.<br></p> <p>\u201cPunishing a man who arrived on a cruise ship exposes the lie that the government\u2019s policies are some sort of humanitarian crusade,\u201d said Daniel Webb of the Human Rights Law Centre.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf this was really about safety, then the government would focus on developing safe and orderly paths to protection for people seeking asylum instead of needless punishing them.\u201d</p> <p>The man said he was woken when officials came into his room at about 1am on Friday morning and restrained him, without allowing him to dress.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThey said, \u2018come on come on\u2019, I said, \u2018Why?

I have her mobile number, it\u2019s in my diary. I can go to my room and get my diary and call her. They said we are going to transfer you to Nauru.\u201d</p> <p>Webb said the Australian government had a legal duty to facilitate a person\u2019s access to legal assistance, and \u201ccalling a switchboard at 3am before bundling a terrified man on to a chartered plane doesn\u2019t cut it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cA government confident its actions are decent and lawful doesn\u2019t secretively deport people on chartered jets in the middle of the night without any meaningful chance to speak to their lawyers\u201d.</p> <p>The man told Guardian Australia he was confused and scared for his life during the deportation. No one told him why he was being deported and he said he remained restrained and shirtless for the whole journey from Melbourne to Nauru.</p> <p>He and a number of guards were the only people on the charter flight, he said, estimating the plane could have seated more than 100 people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/08/government-to-launch-free-speech-inquiry-into-section-18c-of-the-racial-discrimination-act\">Government to launch 'free speech' inquiry into section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The shadow immigration minister, Shayne Neumann, said he was not aware of the specifics of the case but the man\u2019s claims were \u201ctroubling and concerning\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s concerning is the manner in which he was treated, if that\u2019s true.

But the government said it would appeal to the supreme court, which will hear the case in early December and could deliver a verdict in early January. The government said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/brexit-ruling-will-not-derail-article-50-timetable-says-no-10\">its Brexit timetable would not be affected</a> and it still intends to begin divorce proceedings before the end of March. </p> <p>The decision was about how, not whether, Brexit would happen: while many suggested parliament could \u2013 and perhaps should \u2013 now try to push for a soft Brexit with enhanced single-market access, it is highly unlikely to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/07/keir-starmer-labour-will-not-block-article-50-but-must-know-plan\">block Brexit altogether</a>.</p> <p>That did not stop a ferocious reaction to the decision in some quarters \u2013 despite sovereignty of the British parliament, and the right of British judges to rule on British matters, being what much of the leave campaign was about. Ukip\u2019s interim leader, Nigel Farage, said he feared the worst:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I worry that a betrayal may be near at hand \u2026 I now fear that every attempt will be made to block or delay the triggering of article 50.

Both she and May, on a plane to India for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/06/india-warns-uk-immigration-policy-wreck-post-brexit-trade-deal\">difficult talks</a> on a potential new trade deal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/06/truss-and-may-forced-to-stand-up-for-article-50-judges-after-tabloid-abuse\">refused to criticise the newspapers\u2019 attacks</a>. May said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe in and value the independence of our judiciary. I also value the freedom of our press. These both underpin our democracy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Addressing parliament on Monday, the Brexit secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/07/david-davis-parliament-will-not-dictate-brexit-talks\">David Davis, said little we did not already know</a>. He repeated that one reason the government did not want parliament involved too much was so as not to reveal its hand, and accused MPs calling for parliamentary control of the process of wanting to derail Brexit:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s a balance between consulting parliament, and not undermining the government\u2019s negotiating position ... If parliament insists on setting out a detailed minimum negotiating position, that will quickly become the maximum possible offer from the negotiating partners ... In other words, the whole approach is designed to wreck the negotiation.</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s still far too early to say what the decision will end up meaning for Brexit. Among the possibilities, the government could: a. win its appeal; b. fast-track a simple article 50 resolution through parliament; c. get bogged down in endless amendments; or d. decide to call a snap election (see below). </p> <p>Whichever way you cut it, though, it was a heavy blow for May, whose stock \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/22/brexit-means-brexit-when-is-big-question\">Brexit means Brexit</a>\u201d and \u201cno running commentary\u201d bromides may now prove very difficult to maintain. </p> <h2>The view from Europe</h2> <p>While there was little official reaction from EU governments or the Brussels institutions, European capitals will certainly now worry that the Brexit process \u2013 which all would like to be over as quickly as possible, and certainly before the 2019 European elections \u2013 could get complicated. </p> <p>The Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-03/brexit-court-ruling-will-lead-to-uncertainty-dijsselbloem-says\">explained to Bloomberg</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I hope this doesn\u2019t cause even more vagueness and more of a delay, because that\u2019s bad for the UK as well as for the EU ... One of the biggest risks of this process is that it will lead to a very long period of uncertainty. </p> </blockquote> <p>Privately, several EU diplomats echoed the sentiment. One said the most important thing now was \u201cthat we keep on track with the timetable\u201d; another added, with admirable frankness: \u201cWe all know that involving parliaments in complicated, detailed, negotiations is not the smoothest way to go.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af610755b7c165fe50b88620359743ef903bd76c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af610755b7c165fe50b88620359743ef903bd76c/0_195_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeroen Dijsselbloem in Brussels\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeroen Dijsselbloem in Brussels on Monday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The European press was harsh. <a href=\"https://www.welt.de/debatte/kommentare/article159246795/Der-Triumph-ueber-die-eigenmaechtige-Exekutive.html\">Die Welt declared</a> the high court decision a \u201ctriumph over an unauthorised executive\u201d, saying the \u201cobstinacy with which parliamentarians will now seek clarity\u201d over the government\u2019s Brexit plans is \u201cexactly what the prime minister had hoped to avoid\u201d.</p> <p>Separately, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/06/european-commission-examine-terms-uk-deal-nissan\">the commission said it would examine the secret deal Britain struck with Nissan</a> to make sure whatever induced the Japanese carmaker to stay in Britain and build its next two models in Sunderland did not infringe state aid laws.

And what better to encourage that than a snap general election?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/07/2017-election-tories-theresa-may-brexit\">A 2017 general election?

She must face the likelihood that both the Commons and the Lords will focus on securing single market access in ways that could split the cabinet and provoke resignations. The courts have left May little alternative but to change course on the most important issue of her premiership.</p> </blockquote> <p>Polly Toynbee goes further, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/03/brexit-parliament-article-50-mps\">calling for a full-scale parliamentary rebellion</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are times when MPs need to rise above their party interests, their own interests and the views of their constituents. That may risk being voted out, but they may earn more respect by standing up for the national interest as best they can determine: that\u2019s what representative democracy is for. Brexit is the greatest threat to national wellbeing since the war, and this will test the mettle not just of individual MPs, but of the nature and purpose of a representative democratic system.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the Financial Times (paywall), <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a1bd2ae-9f7e-11e6-86d5-4e36b35c3550\">Tony Barber argues that Brexit raises the stakes for the rest of the EU</a>, which he describes \u2013 citing an University of Athens professor \u2013 as resembling \u201can unhappy marriage held together by fear of incalculable divorce costs\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In March EU leaders will commemorate the 60th anniversary of the bloc\u2019s founding treaty of Rome. The 27 will pay tribute to the ideal of integration that has given Europe its longest era of peace and prosperity in history. They will affirm that the EU does not imprison or weaken nations but multiplies their strengths when they act together. Above all, they will pledge to save their marriage because they regard the alternative as unbearably worse.</p> </blockquote> <p>Back at the Guardian, Zoe Williams looks forward, saying that while she has \u201cso far found it extremely difficult to engage with what a post-Brexit Britain should look like\u201d, regretful remainers and sane leavers now need to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/06/ignore-leavers-tantrums-build-brexit-britain-eu\">concentrate not on the Brexiter tantrums but on what needs to be achieved post-Brexit</a> \u2013 because no one is going to stop it:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No technicality will be found to stop Brexit, nobody will snap their fingers and wake us up. It\u2019s not enough to point to looming catastrophes and say what we don\u2019t want; it\u2019s not enough to concentrate on what we might lose. We need to consider what could be better, in a Brexited Britain.

  "<p>For the past month, while the attention of the world has been fixed on every dramatic twist in the US presidential election, the renewal of armed conflict between India and Pakistan has barely touched the headlines. In the past few weeks, the two nuclear states have, between them, killed two dozen civilians and injured scores of others in exchanges of artillery fire across the disputed border \u2013 known as the \u201cline of control\u201d \u2013 that divides Kashmir into parts controlled by India and Pakistan.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/29/pakistani-soldiers-killed-surgical-strikes-kashmir-india\">latest flare-up</a> in the long-running war of attrition between the two countries comes on the heels of a bloody summer of protest and repression in Kashmir that has now been erased from memory by the banging of war drums in Delhi and Islamabad. Since July, when the killing of a young militant leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/11/kashmir-death-toll-23-protests-shooting-burhan-wani-independence-violence\">sparked a furious civilian uprising</a> across the Kashmir valley, the Indian state has responded with singular ruthlessness, killing more than 90 people. Most shocking of all has been the breaking up of demonstrations with \u201cnon-lethal\u201d pellet ammunition, which has blinded hundreds of Kashmiri civilians.</p> <p>In four months, 17,000 adults and children have been injured, nearly five thousand have been arrested, and an entire population spent the summer under the longest curfew in the history of curfews in Kashmir.</p> <p>All this has been quickly forgotten in the past two months. On 18 September, a small group of jihadi fighters, widely believed to have come from Pakistan, staged a commando raid on an Indian army camp near the northern Kashmir town of Uri, killing 19 Indian soldiers \u2013 the deadliest attack on Indian security forces in Kashmir in two decades. Indian politicians quickly blamed Pakistan, which the country\u2019s home minister described as a \u201cterrorist state\u201d, while Pakistani leaders made the implausible claim that India had staged the attack itself to distract from the protests in Kashmir.</p> <p>The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, who came into office promising to take a harder line with Pakistan, announced that \u201cthose behind this despicable attack will not go unpunished\u201d. At the end of September, India retaliated with what it called a \u201csurgical strike\u201d against alleged militant camps in Pakistan-controlled territory, which, according to an army statement, \u201ccaused significant damage to terrorists\u201d. Pakistan denied the attack ever took place \u2013 claiming that there had been nothing more than the usual exchange of fire across the border. Meanwhile, an ugly war of words continued to escalate in TV news studios, some of which were refurbished as pop-up war rooms.</p> <p>Since then, the relationship between the two countries, which is at the best of times characterised by varying degrees of hate \u2013 depending upon the political temperature in Kashmir \u2013 has soured to the point where both are now suddenly finding spies in each others\u2019 diplomatic missions. A tit-for-tat nearly every day, on TV, on social media, in ambassadorial corps \u2013 even in the realm of culture, where India has effectively banned Pakistani actors from working in Bollywood, and Pakistan has banned the screening of Indian films in cinemas. According to recent reports, civilians caught in the crossfire have been evacuated, hundreds of schools shut, and local residents pressed into service to ferry supplies to troops stationed high in the Himalayas<strong>.</strong> As always, the victims of the artillery duels have been the civilians living on either side of a border that did not exist until the middle of the 20th century.</p> <p>In the war of words that has followed the bloodshed in Uri, the brutal oppression of protest in Kashmir has been largely ignored. Indeed, the Indian state, aided by a near-militaristic TV news media, has used the Uri attack and its aftermath to cover up a surge of killings, maimings and blindings in one of the longest-running conflicts in the world. This is the story of the bloody summer that Kashmiris have endured \u2013 and of why they will not forget it.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On 8 July, a militant rebel leader, Burhan Wani,<strong> </strong>was shot dead by Indian armed forces and police in a remote Kashmir village. The killing sparked a series of spontaneous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/10/kashmir-death-toll-rises-as-protesters-defy-curfew\">demonstrations and protests</a>, which, in a matter of days, turned into a reinvigorated popular revolt against India\u2019s dominion over this disputed state.</p> <p>Wani\u2019s path to militancy began in another one of Kashmir\u2019s bloody summers \u2013 back in 2010, when Indian security forces killed 120 protesters. Wani, who was then 15 years old, is said to have joined a small group of homegrown militants after he and his brother were humiliated and abused by Indian soldiers. Over the next few years, he became Kashmir\u2019s most famous militant commander, and acquired something of a cult following among young Kashmiris, who saw him as a symbol of resistance against Indian occupation. Wani was a new breed of militant: unlike the first generation of Kashmir separatist fighters in the early 1990s, he did not cross over into Pakistan; he didn\u2019t use a nom de guerre, and he amassed a huge following on social media, where he issued brazen challenges to the Indian state. It was therefore no surprise that thousands attended Wani\u2019s funeral in his hometown of Tral \u2013 or that those who could not get there organised their own funeral services across the Kashmir valley.</p> <p>As Kashmiris took to the streets, police and paramilitaries were deployed in large numbers across the region. Thousands of young protesters charged at the armed forces with stones and slogans demanding freedom. Indian forces responded with lethal effect, firing bullets, CS gas, and metal pellets into the crowds. In less than four days, nearly 50 people were killed and thousands injured. More people took to the streets to protest against these killings, and the Indian forces and Kashmiri police killed and injured more of them. A cycle of protests connected to the funerals of those protesters were, in turn, fired upon, resulting in yet more killings and blindings. By the end of July, India was faced with a full-scale popular revolt in Kashmir.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"77f92c07beee9be688ba8e66092e7e795cfb8a59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77f92c07beee9be688ba8e66092e7e795cfb8a59/0_0_1536_2560/600.jpg\" alt=\"An Indian policeman aims a pellet gun towards Kashmiri protesters in Srinagar in July.\" width=\"600\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Indian policeman aims a pellet gun towards Kashmiri protesters in Srinagar in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Syed Shahriyar/Syed Shahriyar/NurPhoto via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most recent figures put the number of dead at 94, including a young Kashmiri academic who was <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/soldiers-raid-village-indian-kashmir-one-dead-082540745.html\">battered to death</a> by Indian soldiers, and an <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/protests-in-kashmir-valley-after-body-of-11-year-old-found-with-pellets-3036803/\">11-year-old boy</a>, whose body, riddled with hundreds of pellets, was found on the outskirts of Srinagar, the joint capital of Kashmir, in mid-September. Shockingly, more than 500 people, most of them young, were shot in the face with the pump-action \u201cpellet guns\u201d that the Indian forces routinely use to suppress protests. These weapons discharge hundreds of small metal pellets, or birdshot, capable of piercing the eye.</p> <p>As the uprising continued, the armed forces, by their own admission, fired nearly 4,000 cartridges at stone-throwing demonstrators, crowds protesting against police brutality, and even onlookers. This means that they sent, by one recent estimate, 1.3m metal balls hurtling towards public gatherings predominantly made up of young unarmed people.</p> <p>Children as young as four and five now have multiple pellets in their retinas, blinding them partially, or fully, for life. At the start of September, doctors at Kashmir\u2019s main hospital reported that on average, one person had their eyes ruptured by pellets every other hour since 9 July. \u201cIt means <a href=\"http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/front-page/every-2nd-hour-lethal-pellets-rupture-an-eye-in-kashmir/227294.html\">12 eye surgeries per day</a>,\u201d one doctor told a local newspaper. \u201cIt is shocking.\u201d</p> <p>On 12 July, the fourth day of the protests, the state government, which is run by a controversial coalition between Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and a local ally, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), finally issued its first official statement on the use of the so-called \u201cnon-lethal\u201d pellet guns.<strong> </strong>A spokesperson for the government, representing the PDP, described its position to the media: \u201cWe disapprove of it \u2026 But we will have to persist with this necessary evil till we find a non-lethal alternative.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is no recorded instance of a modern democracy systematically and willfully shooting at people to blind them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At first, the statement appeared as a typical soundbite, the sort of thing that officials must compose and recite with studied ambiguity for the press \u2013 the \u201cgovernment version\u201d, as its known.

There is no other recorded instance of a modern democracy systematically and wilfully shooting at people to blind them. At the end of August, according to data obtained by one of India\u2019s national newspapers, nearly 6,000 civilians had been injured<strong>, </strong>and at least 972 of them had suffered injuries to their eyes.</p> <p>According to official records at SMHS, the main hospital in Srinagar, 570 people sought treatment after their eyeballs were ruptured by metal pellets. Ophthalmologists at the hospital performed more surgeries in three days \u2013 from 10 to 12 July \u2013 than they had in the past three years. Many of the wounded were protesters, but not all. Not one of them deserved to be robbed of their sight.</p> <p>By 14 August, as India prepared to celebrate its Independence Day, Kashmir was under a near total blackout. I briefly lost touch with my parents, as the state cut off all telephones and the internet. I was reminded, once again, of the lines of the late Kashmiri-American poet Agha Shahid Ali, which still echo 20 years after he wrote them: \u201cThe city from where no news can come / is now so visible in its curfewed night / that the worst is precise.\u201d Just before the shutdown, I had talked to my youngest sister over WhatsApp \u2013 she was a little girl in the 90s, when Kashmir witnessed the first rebellion against Indian rule. \u201cI\u2019d never imagined my [three-year-old] child would see everything that I saw as a child,\u201d she told me.</p> <p>Rebellion against India\u2019s rule over Kashmir is neither new nor surprising \u2013 and the brutality of the state\u2019s response is equally familiar. In the 1990s, India came down hard on a widespread uprising in the Kashmir valley \u2013 killing, torturing, disappearing, and imprisoning thousands. Some estimates put the number of people killed since<strong> </strong>1989<strong> </strong>at 70,000. Some 8,000 non-combatants are thought to have been disappeared, and 6,000 are believed to have been buried in mass graves. Human rights reports have identified thousands of cases of torture, including shocking techniques such as \u201csimulated drowning, striping flesh with razor blades and piping petrol into anuses\u201d. According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/09/mass-graves-of-kashmir\">a 2012 report in the Guardian</a>, government documents revealed that one group of security agents had \u201clopped off the limbs of suspects and fed prisoners with their own flesh\u201d.<strong> </strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In southern Kashmir, four girls, aged between 13 and 18, were shot in their faces as recently as last week</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Years later, very little has changed in the Indian state\u2019s response to the demand for self-determination from the people of Kashmir. In a matter of four to five weeks this summer, Indian troops, with a clear mandate to be unsparing, wounded over 10,000 people. One of the youngest \u2013 five-year old Zohra \u2013 was admitted to a hospital in Srinagar with <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/kashmir-violence-what-are-pellet-guns-and-why-are-they-so-lethal-2913917/\">lacerations to her abdomen and legs</a>. Fourteen-year-old Insha was in the family kitchen when a <a href=\"http://thewire.in/51740/kashmir-young-paying-governments-lack-vision/\">swarm of pellets pierced her face</a>. She has lost vision in both eyes. In southern Kashmir, four girls, aged between 13 and 18, were shot in their faces last week. The prognosis for the youngest of these, <a href=\"http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/pellets-continue-to-blind-kashmiri-kids-but-it-has-stopped-making-news-1478345066.html\">13-year-old Ifra Jan</a>, \u201cis not good\u201d, a doctor said. It is doubtful that these little girls posed a threat to the military force \u2013 estimated at 700,000 soldiers and police \u2013 stationed in Kashmir.</p> <p>As the showers of metal pellets were unleashed upon protesters, bystanders and homebound schoolchildren, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/25/opinion/kashmir-and-the-inheritance-of-loss.html?_r=0\">hospitals in Kashmir</a> began to resemble scenes from the great wars of the 20th century. Rows of beds with blindfolded boys and girls on them, parents waiting anxiously, doctors and paramedics in attendance around the clock. On occasion, police and spies also infiltrated the wards to compile profiles of the injured, in order to place them under surveillance after their release. The wounded were brought in by the dozen, like birds in the hunting season.</p> <p>All of this was incomprehensible, even to longtime observers of violence in Kashmir. One of the largest military forces on the planet could not be waging a war against seeing.<strong> </strong>Perhaps a few aberrations, a crowd-control tactic gone woefully wrong \u2013 one hoped so, but the numbers kept piling up, eye after mutilated eye popping up on the screens of phones and computers, as journalists began to publish their reports.</p> <p>As none of the powerful men who run Kashmir from Delhi expressed qualms about the blinding of children, it became clear that in its hubris the Indian state had decided that snatching vision from a few hundred young people was a fair price to pay for keeping Kashmir in check. Perhaps itself blinded by a strain of arrogance peculiar to occupying powers, it continued to pummel a subject population into submission.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The phrase Raqs-e-Bismil,<strong> </strong>used in mystic Persian poetry to denote the passion of the devoted, translates as the \u201cdance of the wounded\u201d. In the slaughterhouse of the Kashmir valley, even the grievously injured \u2013 with pellet-scarred eyes or broken limbs \u2013 have remained defiant. \u201cWe have even got some patients whose guts are perforated and they are asking when they can go back and join the protests,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/08/kashmir-story-defiance-grief-160821113602572.html\">one doctor reported</a>.</p> <p>Two-and-a-half decades of rebellion in Kashmir have hardened the indifference of India\u2019s political and intellectual classes to the human cost of the country\u2019s repressive tactics in the valley. Amid rising nationalist fervour, any sense of the basic rights of a suffering population has been eroded or vanished entirely. The hostility now appears to be total, unbridgeable, and for those on the receiving end, unbearable. Powerful TV studios urge the state to be more aggressively macho, while actively <a href=\"http://www.asianage.com/india/scribe-quits-tv-channel-over-bias-539\">suppressing or distorting news</a> from Kashmir. One prominent newspaper ran an online poll about the continued use of the pellets that had wounded and blinded so many Kashmiris \u2013 a clear majority voted in support. Eminent columnists speak calmly of the need for \u201charsh love\u201d toward civilian protesters to rationalise<strong> </strong>the state\u2019s ruthless response. And the Twitter account for a government initiative, Digital India, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/digital-india-twitter-handle-poem-to-kill-kashmiri-by-indian-army-deleted-shankar-pradad-3021298/\">posted a poem</a> calling for the army to murder Kashmiris until they surrender.</p> <p>As images from Kashmir began to circulate on the internet \u2013 despite frequent attempts to block communications, including at least one midnight raid on the offices of a local newspaper, and a blanket ban on one English daily, the Kashmir Reader \u2013 pictures of the wounded emerged by the dozen, many of them looking as though they had ruptured fruits where their eyes should have been. On the second day of the protests, more than 50 people were admitted to the main hospital in Srinagar. Medics and parents were desperate to save vision in at least one eye for those who had been shot, attempting to extract the jagged and irregular pellets. \u201cThis only happens in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-36822567\">a war-like situation</a>,\u201d a surgeon sent from Delhi later said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9ab063d714870483d86b81e29ce26509b6334778\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ab063d714870483d86b81e29ce26509b6334778/0_256_3900_2341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Kashmiri protester who was shot by Indian security forces in Srinagar, in July 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Kashmiri protester who was shot by Indian security forces in Srinagar, in July 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tauseef Mustafa/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The protocol for the use of these crowd control weapons is to aim at the legs to disperse demonstrators. But it seems that the paramilitaries and the police have been deliberately firing into faces. Some may only have minor wounds, some will suffer limited loss of vision, some will lose one eye, some both, and some will be impaired for life, but the pitiless assault on protesting adolescents forces us to ask one question: is the Indian state happy to blind a generation?</p> <p>It is inconceivable that policy mandarins in Delhi or their advisers in Kashmir could be unaware of the destructive power of \u201cnon-lethal weapons\u201d. Earlier this year, the International Network of Civil Liberties Organisations and Physicians for Human Rights published a report titled \u201c<a href=\"http://www.iccl.ie/international-network-of-civil-liberties-organizations-launch-report-on-crowd-control-weapons.html\">Lethal in Disguise</a>\u201d. \u201cPellet rounds\u201d, it stated, \u201ccause an indiscriminate spray of ammunition that spreads widely and cannot be aimed ...\u201d They, therefore, \u201care not only likely to be lethal at close range, but are likely to be inaccurate and indiscriminate at longer ranges, even those recommended by manufacturers for safety\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Many countries have banned police from using ammunition meant for hunting animals. The multidirectional spray of pellets was designed to catch prey in flight. But many countries have continued to use them as a means of force to control civilian demonstrators.</p> <p>In Israel, security forces often deploy lethal and \u201cnon-lethal\u201d ammunition against Palestinian protesters, and crowd-control weapons have blinded at least five young Palestinians in the last two years. The use of rubber bullets by police was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/apr/30/rubber-bullets-banned-catalonia-spain-video\">banned in the Spanish region of Catalonia</a> in 2014, after at least seven people were blinded by them on the streets of Barcelona.</p> <p>In 2011, months after the uprising in Tahrir Square that toppled an Egyptian dictator, a young police lieutenant, Mohamed el-Shenawy, became infamous for firing pellets into the eyes of protesters against Egypt\u2019s military government. His exemplary skill at blinding civilians earned him the nickname the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/mar/06/eye-sniper-tahrir-egypt-jailed\">Eye Sniper</a>\u201d, and his notoriety as a symbol of ongoing state brutality eventually led to a three-year jail sentence.</p> <p>Will India prosecute its own eye snipers? Or outlaw the use of these weapons?</p> <p>In the country\u2019s present hypernationalist mood, every kind of other is a suspicious figure, a ready-made scapegoat for any failure that befalls the politicians determined to make India great again: the secessionist Kashmiri, the impure Dalit, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/03/inside-bishari-indian-village-where-mob-killed-man-for-eating-beef\">traitorous beef-eating Muslim</a>, the woman who speaks her mind, the anti-national journalist, the dissenting writer. Any voices who might call for a ban on these \u201cnon-lethal\u201d guns are certain to be ignored. To the contrary, ministers and police, and their demagogues and cheerleaders, have continued to advocate the use of both pellets and bullets against protesting crowds in Kashmir: unruly cattle must be reined in at any cost.</p> <p>Because Kashmiris have become accustomed to the violence inflicted on them \u2013 as they are to the indifference of the world \u2013 when pellets were first sprayed at protesters in the heated summer of 2010, most people processed this as nothing more than a new misfortune; just another element of the war in Kashmir. If one were to draw a diagram of the assaults inflicted on Kashmiri bodies over the decades, hardly a single part would remain unmarked: in the 1990s, when the violence was at its worst, the eyes were spared; now they seem to have become a favourite target.<strong> </strong>The victims of such tactics, consciously and not, cultivate reserves of tolerance for pain, but also a capacity to remember.</p> <p>I remember, too. I grew up amid the darkness of the late 80s and early 90s. I remember that most of us teenagers innately understood that being abused, slapped, or beaten with batons and rifle butts by an Indian trooper was a bit of a joke when compared to the horrors that others endured in the dungeons of Kashmir. (One of the most notorious torture centres, Papa II \u2013 a colonial-era building on the banks of Dal Lake in Srinagar \u2013 was refurbished and redecorated, and served as the stately residence of the late pro-India politician Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. His daughter, as the current chief minister, now presides over the brutalisation of another generation of Kashmiri youth.)</p> <p>I remember that the war in those years taught us to treat corpses and shrouds as reminders of passing time, which was measured for the young in massacres and assassinations. I recall, too, the tragic rupture in the Kashmiri body politic when an atmosphere of fear and loathing forced out the Kashmiri Pandits \u2013 a Hindu minority that had cohabited with Muslim Kashmiris for centuries \u2013 in an almost overnight exodus<strong>, </strong>many of them targeted and killed by separatist militants. Sanjay Tickoo, who runs an organisation for the welfare of Kashmiri Hindus, says: \u201cOver the past 20 years, we estimate that <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/kashmirtheforgottenconflict/2011/07/201176134818984961.html\">650 Pandits were killed</a> in the valley.\u201d I don\u2019t know what happened to Sunil and Rajesh, my childhood mates from the primary school we all attended near an idyllic river bend in Verinag in south Kashmir.</p> <p>Growing up, I experienced a brutal, bleak time, as India\u2019s response to the uprising included the grotesque policy of \u201ccatch and kill\u201d, under which combatants and non-combatants alike were dispatched in summary executions or tortured to death. And yet, I don\u2019t remember such a vengeful assault on ordinary people as we are seeing now. Buoyed by a belligerent nationalist at the helm in Delhi, the security forces on the ground perhaps feel emboldened to unleash a more widespread cruelty.</p> <p>In 2013, an affecting <a href=\"http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/casualties-of-kashmirs-unrest-live-in-the-dark/\">photo essay</a> by journalist Zahid Rafiq in the New York Times documented a few of the stories of those who had been blinded by pellets. It remains a grim testament to the darkness in Kashmir <strong>\u2013 </strong>even though the blindings at that time, amid hundreds dead, did not attract too much notice. At the time, hardly any Indian civil society group or human rights organisation thought fit to speak up about such a wicked crime. The wanton demonisation of the Kashmiri Muslim, a project that some media organisations in India take particular pleasure in, was perhaps fully realised even then. It certainly is now, when thousands<strong>, </strong>fed on a daily diet of nationalist fury, take to social media to celebrate the killing, maiming, and blinding of young Kashmiris.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>That the government in Kashmir<strong> </strong>\u2013 a collection of local elites comprising career politicians, technocrats, and chancers loyal to India \u2013 considers pellet guns a \u201cnecessary evil\u201d, might make us feel grateful. At least they acknowledge the \u201cevil\u201d part<strong> \u2013 </strong>perhaps to address their own guilty consciences.</p> <p>A few days into this summer\u2019s uprising<strong>,</strong> the Kashmir Observer, a local English-language daily, reported that the local government had deployed a fleet of brand new ambulances to securely <a href=\"https://kashmirobserver.net/2016/local-news/amid-bloodbath-streetsgovt-using-ambulances-ferry-vip-guests-picnicking-8686\">ferry visiting VIPs</a> to picnic spots in the valley. This was while protesters were being killed, maimed and blinded \u2013 and while the ambulances carrying them to hospitals were coming under fire from security forces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8b93e0246bc9206eeb55ba4c70583f22282ca528\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b93e0246bc9206eeb55ba4c70583f22282ca528/0_97_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victims of police shooting who have been blinded in one or both eyes in hospital in Srinagar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victims of police shooting who have been blinded in one or both eyes in hospital in Srinagar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yawar Nazir/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An ophthalmologist at the main hospital in Kashmir told the Indian Express in July: \u201cFor the first time the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/kashmir-protests-non-lethal-weapon-pellets-causing-more-damage-to-eyes-doctors-2918249/\">foreign bodies are irregular edged</a>, which causes more damage once it strikes the eye.\u201d Irregular, sharp edges? I had assumed that the pellets fired at protesters \u2013 like rubber or plastic bullets, were round discoid things. It turns out that there exist different kinds of pellets, and in 2016, some Indian forces are using the jagged variety \u2013 which inflict greater damage to flesh and eyes alike, and which doctors say is far more difficult to remove.</p> <p>How did India get here? How is it all right for a constitutionally democratic and secular, modern nation to blind scores of civilians in a region it controls? Not an authoritarian state, not a crackpot dictatorship, not a rogue nation or warlord outside of legal and ethical commitments to international statutes, but a democratic country, a member of the comity of nations. How are India\u2019s leaders, thinkers and its thundering televised custodians of public and private morality, all untroubled by the sight of a child whose <a href=\"http://kashmirreader.com/2016/07/21/first-patient-to-have-pellets-in-heart-is-13-years-old/\">heart has been penetrated by metal pellets</a>? This is the kind of cruelty we expect from Assad\u2019s Syria, not the world\u2019s largest democracy.</p> <p>Historically, such an inhuman response to an uprising \u2013 to mass dissent \u2013 has been the province of empires and tyrants. A modern democratic nation rarely unleashes such violence, except upon victims whom it does not regard as its own people. It is quite clear that for India and its rulers, Kashmiris have been subjects and not citizens for as long as Kashmiris have refused Indian rule. You do not shower projectiles that target eyes and viscera on a people you consider your own. In snatching away the vision of Kashmiri children, the Indian state has decisively announced that it has only one message: <em>you must be servile and submissive, and if you refuse, we will unleash our fury</em><strong>.</strong></p> <p>With a hubris derived from its might and military dominion over Kashmir, the state convinces itself that it has the power to inflict blindness. In no time, then, it blinds itself too \u2013 to the <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/unrest-in-kashmir-threat-to-the-idea-of-india/story-2uVkjCgSGdsXOEzKHVWIPK.html\">character of democracy</a> that is its central founding principle. The harsh repression of Kashmiri protests, the Nobel prize-winning Indian economist Amartya Sen declared in July, is \u201cthe <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/amartya-sen-kashmir-situation-democracy-raghuram-rajan/1/717959.html\">biggest blot on India\u2019s democracy</a>\u201d.</p> <p>It is hard not to see this mood of brutality connected, at the very least in its tenor, to the larger register of extreme violence, by both state and non-state actors, that has come to be normalised over the last couple of decades.</p> <p>There has been some dissent in India. Journalists, activists, even <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/opinion/over-40-days-curfew-in-kashmir-shows-how-wrong-we-have-got-it-1446756\">some politicians</a>, have written elegiac <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/opinion/what-burhan-wanis-death-exposes-for-kashmir-and-delhi-1430050\">columns and essays</a> on the savage response to the rebellion in Kashmir. They have implored their government to cease the brutality, to be kind, and to <a href=\"http://thewire.in/61373/framework-peace-kashmir/\">talk to Kashmiris</a>. But it appears that the Indian government, clouded by a newfound chauvinism and a hunger for votes, is in no mood to listen to the nation\u2019s voices of sanity. In August, only a few days after Indian forces in Srinagar murdered a <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/kashmir-21-year-old-killed-by-pellets-case-registered-against-security-personnel-2951122/\">21-year-old cash-machine watchman</a> by firing 300 pellets into his body from close range, the Indian prime minister used a <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/full-text-of-pm-narendra-modi-speech-pakistan-forgets-that-it-bombs-its-own-citizens/\">speech on Kashmir</a> to taunt Pakistan over its own atrocities against separatists in the province of Balochistan, where the Pakistani army has inflicted forced disappearances and summary executions on the Baloch people. \u201cPakistan forgets that it bombs its own citizens using fighter planes,\u201d he said. But Modi chose to forget that his own forces had, by then, killed scores of young Kashmiris.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>We need to interrogate the circumstances that have led to the deliberate blinding of hundreds of young people at the hands of armed forces in Kashmir, before this too is forgotten. As some of the wounded have begun to heal, some accounts have suggested that the damage may have been less severe than initially feared \u2013 that perhaps many of those who underwent eye surgery will regain \u201csome vision\u201d in at least one eye. This might make one feel better<strong> </strong>\u2013 relieved that its not worse \u2013 but there is something wrong with that kind of moral reckoning, akin to the Indian security officials who continue to maintain that pellet guns must be used because the alternative would be worse. One security official told an Indian news website that pellet guns had actually \u201c<a href=\"http://thewire.in/51740/kashmir-young-paying-governments-lack-vision/\">saved lives</a>\u201d: \u201cIt is unfortunate that there have been eye injuries but the pellets are less lethal than getting hit by bullets.\u201d</p> <p>So we might ask: what if the armed forces stationed in Kashmir had fired live bullets instead? <em>Imagine the death toll!</em> But this doesn\u2019t compute: in 2016, the security forces have already killed nearly 100 civilians. Is that an acceptable number?</p> <p>In a year or two, as India, and Pakistan, continue to harp on their territorialist positions, there will arrive a season of surface calm \u2013 a \u201creturn to normalcy\u201d \u2013 in Kashmir. People will shop, marry off their children, and celebrate an uncurfewed Eid. They will also welcome tourists in their blighted land.</p> <p>But when this new generation of freedom-seekers grows up into blinded, maimed, adulthood, they will carry our guilt-ridden consciences for us. They will remember more than they have seen. They will certainly remember the country that did this to them.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",

industrial agreements with employees.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the union alleges FWBC rejected the Appselec Qld draft agreement on the basis it infringed an aspirational objective, not a hard requirement, in the code.</p> <p>The objective states that agreements should promote \u201cfair, cooperative and productive workplace relations in the building and construction industry\u201d.</p> <p>The regulator claimed that clauses allowing employees to attend union meetings unpaid for up to four hours a week and requiring consultation before a company hired labour or contractors infringed that objective.</p> <p>FWBC also objected to a clause requiring that head contractors \u201cpay the difference\u201d between their rates of pay for their regular employees and the employees of subcontractors. </p> <p>The clause is common in the building industry and ensures workers are paid the same regardless of contracting arrangements, providing job security by decreasing the incentive to contract out work.</p> <p>In its assessment of the deal, the regulator said such a clause constituted an \u201cunregistered agreement\u201d, which is also banned by the code.</p> <p>The case is the first time a union has challenged decisions made by FWBC since the minister of employment transferred the power to assess deals from the employment department to the building industry regulator in May. </p> <p>The ETU is angry that clauses of the type rejected are contained in dozens of agreements in the electrical contracting industry and many more in the building industry, including ones that passed the test when it was applied by the department.</p> <p>The ETU national secretary, Allen Hicks, said FWBC had \u201cabused its power and disrupted the rule of law within the industry by using spurious grounds to disqualify perfectly legal agreements\u201d.</p> <p>Hicks accused FWBC of \u201chaphazard\u201d intervention in collective bargaining and \u201cignoring the legal parameters of their role\u201d.</p>

We want certainty in the parliament this week.</p> <p>\u201cWe need all parties to come together, to claim that bipartisanship that they say so strongly they support, to support Australian farmers ... to deliver certainty.\u201d</p> <p>The fight over the backpacker tax has been going on for 18 months.</p> <p>It started with the former Abbott government\u2019s 2015 budget, which proposed raising the income tax on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/12/budget-savings-hit-surprising-targets-backpackers-and-fly-in-fly-out-workers\">working holidaymakers from 13% to 32.5%</a>.</p> <p>The idea was dormant for over a year before Malcolm Turnbull announced a review of the tax in the leadup to this year\u2019s election.</p> <p>In September, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/27/backpacker-tax-scott-morrison-announces-cut-from-325-to-19\">announced a 19% tax rate</a>, with a $5 increase in the passenger movement charge to $60. To balance the package, the government also proposed to reduce the visa application charge by $50, increase the working holiday visa age from 30 to 35, and increase the time backpackers could work for one employer from six to 12 months.</p> <p> Uncertainty over the tax rate for backpackers has angered the agricultural industry, with farmers saying it has made it much harder to attract workers.</p> <p>Joyce said if Labor did not support the government\u2019s proposal to cut the backpacker tax from 32.5% to 19%, the tax would remain at 32.5% from 1 January, 2017.</p> <p>But Whish-Wilson said there was no reason why that should be the case, according to advice from the parliamentary library and answers from Treasury and the tax office.</p> <p>\u201cLet me tell you, Barnaby standing up here and saying that the default is going to be 32.5% is absolutely bullshit, it\u2019s not the case,\u201d Whish-Wilson said.</p> <p>\u201cSome backpackers will be legally entitled to pay no tax for their first $18,200 [earned], depending on their residency.</p> <p>\u201cThe only way this [current 32.5% tax] could become the default rate is if the Australian Tax Office decides to crack down on this issue of residency, do audits, and actually seek the revenue.\u201d</p> <p>The Labor Senator Chris Ketter, who was deputy chair of the <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/BackpackerTaxBill2016\">Senate committee that investigated the backpacker tax</a>, said Labor\u2019s proposal would be a win for farmers and tourism operators.<br></p> <p>\u201cI participated in a number of hearings on the backpacker tax and it was clear to me that the government had failed to properly consult with stakeholders,\u201d he said. \u201cThey even failed to consult Treasury with regards to economic forecasting.</p> <p>\u201cThe original rate of 32.5% was clearly too much and their alternative proposal of 19% was rushed,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The committee will deliver its report on the backpacker tax on Wednesday.</p> <p>But Nationals MP Andrew Broad, a strong critic of the 32.5% tax rate, criticised Labor\u2019s proposal to cut the rate to 10.5%, saying it would give foreign workers a better deal than Australian workers.</p> <p>He said Joel Fitzgibbon, the Shadow Agriculture Minister, would not be taken seriously by the sector after Tuesday\u2019s announcement because he was clearly playing politics with the issue.</p> <p>Broad said no Nationals MP would vote for Labor\u2019s amendments if they made it to the lower house.</p> <p><strong><br></strong></p>",
