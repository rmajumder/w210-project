  "<p>The impetus for Maxine Beneba Clarke\u2019s memoir came from a torrent of racial abuse. At the time, she was pushing a stroller and walking to pick her son up from school. A young man in a passing ute unleashed a torrent of expletives, telling her to drown her five-month-old daughter and \u201cgo the fuck back to where you came from.\u201d</p> <p> Clarke, a poet and author of Afro-Caribbean descent, had initially planned on writing a memoir tracing her family history back to West Africa, from where her ancestors were forced to leave as part of the slave trade. The ute driver\u2019s hateful invective prompted further reflection on race relations in Australia, and the insidious attitudes and injustices that culminate in overtly racist attacks. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t understand casual racism,\u201d says Clarke.</p> <p> Instead of tracing her ancestry, she began working on what could become The Hate Race. The memoir chronicles her childhood in Australia as well as the indelible effects of schoolyard bullying. The cumulative effect of racist remarks is \u201clike a poison,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt eats away the very essence of your being.\u201d</p> <p> Born in Sydney to a mathematician father and actress mother, Clarke grew up in predominantly white suburbia in the 80s and 90s. She was first made aware of her race in preschool, when a girl singled out her skin colour. In the years that followed, there came relentless taunts, spitballs, malicious letters and cartoons, and teachers and counsellors ill-equipped to confront racist behaviour or who dismissed it as just \u201ca little bit of teasing\u201d. The horrific name-calling infected Clarke\u2019s self-perception. \u201cI knew exactly what I was,\u201d she writes. Coon. Blackie. Golliwog. Monkey Girl. The persistent bullying was crushing:</p> <p> <em>Somewhere along the line, we just give in.</em></p> <p> <em>Somewhere along the line, we stop reporting.</em></p> <p> <em>Somewhere along the line, we die a little.</em></p> <p> Clarke\u2019s longing for acceptance, to be one of the popular girls with \u201csun-kissed skin and wavy blonde hair\u201d, was physically manifested. At nights she unconsciously scratched at her face, trying \u201cto claw my way out of my skin\u201d. Earlier, as a seven-year-old, she rejoiced when a light patch appeared on her cheek, because she had fantasised about her skin turning white. </p> <p>\u201cThe metamorphosis was starting; the ugly duckling becoming a swan,\u201d she writes. It turned out to be vitiligo, a pigmentation disorder, which later resolved.</p> <p> For Clarke, whose short-story collection Foreign Soil won an Australian Book Industry Award last year, the bullying fuelled a desire to succeed. She was academically gifted and excelled at debating and public speaking \u2013 presaging her later success as a spoken word poet. The bullying has shaped her adult self, Clarke admits, but she is wary of her story being held up as an example of triumph over adversity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/21/if-i-could-peel-back-my-brown-skin-youd-see-the-aussie-bogan-on-the-inside\">If I could peel back my brown skin, you'd see the Aussie bogan on the inside | Rana Hussain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFor every one of me there\u2019s probably a thousand other kids who have anxiety issues or whose experiences have snowballed into a negative adulthood or depression,\u201d she says. Bullying by no means \u201cmakes kids tougher and more wanting to succeed. I think often it just crushes people.\u201d</p> <p>The resurgence of xenophobia in Australia troubles Clarke. She sees an \u201cawful synchronicity\u201d between past and present. Her parents left England in the 70s, soon after Enoch Powell\u2019s infamous \u201cRivers of Blood\u201d speech, which decried black immigrants and predicted that foreign children would overcrowd hospitals and schools. Two decades later, Clarke watched Pauline Hanson\u2019s entr\u00e9e into politics with a shockingly similar maiden speech, accompanied by a shift in public sentiment around race and immigration. Unsurprisingly, she is not optimistic about Hanson\u2019s return, the rise of One Nation and Islamophobic rhetoric.</p> <p> \u201cI feel as if there is really a global post-colonial situation at the moment,\u201d which especially victimises children, Clarke says. \u201cThere are children\u2019s bodies being brutalised or being washed up on beaches. We see brown children being locked up on Nauru and in Villawood Detention Centre. We see things like Don Dale and Indigenous communities having their funding cut.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a0b1febda7b9afde2ed28bcf45b3b63022cd8f15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0b1febda7b9afde2ed28bcf45b3b63022cd8f15/0_0_2145_3279/654.jpg\" alt=\"the hate race book cover\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> But Clarke does see hope in Australia\u2019s young people. \u201cI look at my kids\u2019 generation, and their outlook and the way they behave towards each other is different from anything I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime,\u201d she says. The cultural makeup of Australia has changed since Clarke\u2019s childhood, and diversity in books, television, and online media have played a major role. Sharing stories breeds tolerance through understanding, Clarke believes. \u201cIt\u2019s a wide big world and that there are lots of different kinds of people in it,\u201d she says. \u201cThe best thing [a child] could possibly do is to learn to get along with everybody, because that\u2019s just part of life.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Hate Race is published by Hachette.

  "<p>Russell Simmons, the American entrepreneur and founder of Def Jam Records, recalled a time when he was Donald Trump\u2019s close friend. They spent nearly every weekend together at Trump\u2019s Florida resort Mar-a-Lago, and was even present for Trump\u2019s first date with wife Melania and later attended their wedding.</p> <p>But the version of Trump he now sees on the campaign trail is someone Simmons no longer recognizes. Appearing on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2016/aug/09/russell-simmons-black-lives-matter-clinton-trump-politics-for-humans\">new episode of Politics for Humans</a>, a podcast hosted by Guardian US political reporter Sabrina Siddiqui, Simmons criticized the Republican presidential nominee as preying on ignorance to fuel a campaign \u201cof hate\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s scary \u2013 you don\u2019t want him to be president, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Simmons said, adding that Trump was \u201ca grudge carrier\u201d and the two no longer speak.</p> <p>\u201cHe don\u2019t talk to me after I said I\u2019d rather Kim Kardashian be president.\u201d</p> <p>Simmons, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/26/straight-outta-compton-will-smith-russell-simmons-alternative-oscars\">music industry mogul</a> who has also emerged as a prominent activist, has taken particular issue with Trump\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric against Muslims. Trump has repeatedly campaigned on banning all Muslim immigration to the US, called for shutting down mosques in America and most recently picked a fight with the Muslim parents of a fallen Iraq War hero.</p> <p>But years ago, Simmons said Trump accompanied him to a meeting with Muslim leaders at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York, the city\u2019s largest mosque, and was amenable to engaging with the community.</p> <p>\u201cHe was very kind and that was the end of it,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cBut years later, this fire has come up.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s fuelled a lot of hate and a lot of people are ignorant, and he\u2019s helped to promote that ignorance.\u201d </p> <p>Simmons recently launched a campaign, Muslims Speaking Out, which aims to counter Islamophobia in the US by drawing a distinction between terrorists and the greater Muslim community. Simmons formed the initiative through The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, a not-for-profit organization he chairs that seeks to improve relations between ethnic and religious communities. </p> <p>In the Politics for Humans podcast, which examines the Black Lives Matter movement and social justice, Simmons also reflected on his experience as a black male and encounters with law enforcement.</p> <p>\u201cAs a young person, I was always afraid of the police, and I have had experiences of being mistreated and yelled at and talked down to,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been afraid when I see them coming.\u201d</p> <p>Even in recent years, Simmons said, he has been pulled over for routine traffic stops and was verbally abused by one police officer who did not immediately recognize him. The cop changed his demeanor when he saw Simmons\u2019 license, but the producer noted that other people of color who are not public figures lack the means to push back against discrimination.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re powerless and you\u2019re black, you don\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Simmons said.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, 60 or 70 kids [are] getting shot in Chicago this weekend, and if one little girl in Brooklyn is missing named Becky, they\u2019ll look for her for six months on TV.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo black lives don\u2019t matter.

Hillary Clinton paid a visit earlier to a health clinic in Miami, the epicenter of the Zika outbreak in the US, and appealed to Republican leaders to convene an emergency session of Congress to pass funding to combat the mosquito-borne virus, <em>reports <strong>Sabrina Siddiqui </strong>in Washington</em>.</p> <p>The Democratic nominee used the bully pulpit of the presidential campaign to voice her frustration with lawmakers in Washington, who left town last month for a summer recess without meeting the federal government\u2019s request for funds to fight the spread of the Zika virus.</p> <p>\u201cI am very disappointed that the Congress went on recess before actually agreeing on what they would do to put the resources into this fight,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd I really am hoping that they will pay attention.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton delivered her remarks following a tour of the Borinquen Health Care Center, a community clinic in Miami\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood, which has borne the brunt of Florida\u2019s Zika outbreak. The state of Florida, a key battleground in November\u2019s presidential race, has been the most severely hit by the virus, which poses the greatest threat to pregnant women due to its cause of birth defects such as microcephaly.</p> <p>Clinton said she first learned of Zika in December through her daughter Chelsea, who was pregnant at the time with her second child. </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to wake up in a year and read so many more stories about babies like the little girl who just died in Houston,\u201d Clinton said, citing a fatal case of Zika-related microcephaly reported out of Texas on Tuesday. </p> <p>\u201cThat is just not something we should tolerate in our country.\u201d</p> <p>The Obama administration requested a $1.9bn spending package several months ago, basing its figure on the needs of public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p> <p>The request quickly devolved into partisan politics on Capitol Hill, as House Republicans instead passed a measure that included riders to overturn certain clean water regulations, restricted money for Planned Parenthood and undermined the health care law. Senate Democrats twice filibustered the House-passed proposal, which Barack Obama has also said he would veto.</p> <p>Republicans have in turn accused Democrats of blocking the necessary funding and on Tuesday took aim at Tim Kaine, the Virginia senator and Clinton\u2019s vice presidential running mate, for voting against their Zika bill. Clinton urged lawmakers to put aside politics and advance a separate bipartisan agreement that cleared the Senate in June and would allocate $1.1bn in funding with no strings attached.</p> <p>She also took aim at Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has ignored the Zika virus all together and told a local television station in Florida he did not need to opine on the issue because the state\u2019s governor, Rick Scott, had it \u201cunder control\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI disagree with those who say that Zika is an insignificant issue,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThis is something we need to take seriously.\u201d</p> <p>Contrary to Trump\u2019s claims, Scott, a Republican who has endorsed the nominee, has sounded repeated alarms over the Zika outbreak. He, too, implored US lawmakers to return to Washington and address the funding gap.</p> <p>\u201cThe federal government must stop playing politics and Congress needs to immediately come back to session to resolve this,\u201d Scott said on Tuesday, as Florida\u2019s health department identified four more individuals who likely contracted Zika through a mosquito bite.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/zika-virus-could-be-linked-with-whole-spectrum-of-disorders\">Zika virus could be linked with 'whole spectrum' of disorders</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T17:45:41.031Z\">at 6.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57aa43e0e4b03b51a99e18f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T20:58:24.267Z\">9.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Salman Rushdie, himself no stranger to threats of assassination, has delivered his verdict on the nature of Donald Trump\u2019s remarks:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SalmanRushdie/status/763114271039451136\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Of course the Trump flacks are now trying to confuse the issue, but Senator Murphy is clear about what Trump meant. <a href=\"https://t.co/7fDmDyCSjw\">https://t.co/7fDmDyCSjw</a></p>&mdash; Salman Rushdie (@SalmanRushdie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SalmanRushdie/status/763114271039451136\">August 9, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa41c6e4b0f5d064841f0b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T20:49:25.772Z\">9.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>US Secret Service, on Donald Trump\u2019s comments:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Secret Service is aware of the comment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa40e3e4b0f5d064841f07\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T20:49:03.610Z\">9.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The NRA might have changed the channel a little early.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NRA/status/763110521889402880\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@RealDonaldTrump</a> is right.

So, in the interest of providing as much information as possible to American readers and voters, here are Trump\u2019s full comments regarding the Second Amendment today:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hillary wants to abolish, essentially, the Second Amendment. By the way, if she gets to pick, if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I dunno. But I tell you what, that will be a horrible day. If Hillary gets to put her judges in, right now we\u2019re tied. You see what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re tied \u2018cause Scalia, this was not supposed to happen. Justice Scalia was going to be around for ten more years, at least, and this is what happened. That was a horrible thing, So now look at it. So Hillary essentially wants to abolish the second amendment.</p> <p>Now speaking to the NRA folks, who are great: when you, when you, and I tell you, so they endorsed me. They endorsed me very early. My sons are members. I\u2019m a member. If you, we can add, I think the National Rifle Association, we can add the Second Amendment to the justices, they almost go, in a certain way, hand and hand. Now the justices are going to do things that are so important. And we have such great justices. You saw my list of eleven that have been vetted and respected and have gotten great, and they, a little bit, equate.</p> <p>But if you don\u2019t do what\u2019s the right thing, you\u2019re not going to have - either you\u2019re not going to have a Second Amendment or you\u2019re not going to have much of it left. And you\u2019re not going to be able to protect yourselves, which you need. Which you need! When the bad guys burst into your hours, they\u2019re not looking about Second Amendments and \u2018do I have the right to do this.\u2019 The bad guys aren\u2019t going to be giving up their weapons. But the good people will say, \u2018oh, well, that\u2019s the law.\u2019 No, no. Not going to happen. We can\u2019t let it happen. We can\u2019t let it happen.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa3d44e4b0f5d064841ef4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T20:30:29.384Z\">9.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Video: </strong>Donald Trump implying that the use of firearms might be adequate response to Hillary Clinton\u2019s selection of supreme court justices.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/09/trump-clinton-second-amendment-people-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q7nk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2643266\"            data-video-name=\"Trump suggests 'second amendment people' could stop Clinton \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57aa3839e4b03b51a99e18bf\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/09/080916trumpsecond_KP-28685879_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/09/080916trumpsecond_KP-28685879.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/09/080916trumpsecond_KP-28685879_V4.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/09/trump-clinton-second-amendment-people-video\">Trump suggests \u2018second amendment people\u2019 could stop Clinton</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa3cf6e4b03b51a99e18d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T20:29:27.584Z\">9.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Roger Stone, an informal adviser to the Trump campaign, <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/07/29/roger-stone-milo-show-trump-can-fight-voter-fraud/\">implied last month</a> to internet agitator Milo Yiannopoulos that the notion of discrediting the election as \u201cillegitimate\u201d is part of Trump\u2019s campaign strategy.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have widespread voter fraud, but the first thing that Trump needs to do is begin talking about it constantly,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe needs to say for example, today would be a perfect example: \u2018I am leading in Florida.

With boats carrying asylum seekers arriving consistently \u2013 as they have on and off since the mid-1970s \u2013 and with immigration proving a divisive, possibly critical issue in a federal election campaign, the MV Tampa provided the conservative Coalition government with a catalyst for action.

Most were resettled, and mostly in Australia. The Nauru detention regime ended in farce, with Australia at one point paying for the massive bureaucracy of an entire incarceration centre housing just two Iraqi men, both of whom were found to be refugees and were resettled.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/10/i-want-death-nauru-files-chronicle-despair-of-asylum-seeker-children\">\u2018I want death\u2019: Nauru files chronicle despair of asylum seeker children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nauru\u2019s second iteration as an isle of detention, instituted by a Labor government and carried on with unswerving determination by the current Liberal-National Coalition government, began in 2012.

They set out every reportable \u201cincident\u201d on the island. Such events include attempts at self-harm, sexual assaults, child abuse, hunger strikes, assaults and injuries. While some of these cases have been reported by the Guardian and other news organisations, the logs set out in detail the totality of harm caused by prolonged detention in Australia\u2019s notorious offshore detention camps. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive\">The Nauru files: the lives of asylum seekers in detention detailed in a unique database \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like many other countries around the world, Australia has privatised its immigration detention centres. But Australia has gone a step beyond other countries: it has exported its detention centres offshore \u2013 to Nauru and to Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Any asylum seeker who arrives by boat in Australia is immediately placed in one of these facilities and told they will never be resettled in Australia. The policy is a hardline deterrent established to \u201cstop the boats\u201d \u2013 a familiar slogan in Australian politics.</p> <h2>What information does the interactive contain?</h2> <p>The Guardian\u2019s interactive holds the detailed incident reports as well as a \u201csummary log\u201d of each report. All of these have been written by detention centre staff. The data has been grouped by month and year, by incident category and by risk rating. You can explore individual incidents, or search by type or timeframe. When you select an individual incident you can also share it across social networks.</p> <p>The summary logs that appear when you click on the coloured squares are the staff\u2019s truncated versions of the detailed incident reports. Click \u201cSee original report\u201d to view the incident reports themselves.</p> <h2>What is an incident report?</h2> <p>An incident report is a short summary of an event in the Nauru detention centre written by staff there. Some of the details in the files may distress some readers. They can range from an observation of a threat of self-harm, to abuse of a child, or a more mundane incident such as a child falling over when playing soccer. These reports form part of the contractual requirements set down by the Australian government in order to document and keep records of what is happening inside the detention system. </p> <h2>Who writes these reports?</h2> <p>Scores of staff from a number of private companies have written them. The Australian government has privatised its immigration detention system, outsourcing the services within it. Broadspectrum (formerly known as Transfield Services) manages the detention centre and subcontracts security services to Wilson Security. International Health and Medical Services provides medical care. Save the Children provided welfare and childcare services until the end of 2015.</p> <h2>When is an incident reportable and how are they rated and categorised?</h2> <p>Incidents are reportable when they fall into one of the categories that have been set out in Transfield Services\u2019 contract with Australia\u2019s immigration department. These reports are given a \u201crisk rating\u201d in three distinct categories: critical, major and minor.</p> <p>Critical incidents must be reported verbally within 30 minutes and in writing within three hours. Major incidents must be reported verbally within an hour and in writing within six hours. Minor incidents don\u2019t require a verbal report. A written report only needs to be filed within 24 hours. Timeframes for reporting incidents to the department are extremely important because failures to meet these deadlines can trigger financial penalties.</p> <p>There is also a fourth rating that appears frequently in the logs: information reports. These types of reports do not appear to have any basis in the contract with Australia\u2019s immigration department but they are extremely common.</p> <p>Separately from the risk rating, the reports are also broken down into classifications; for instance \u201cconcern for minor raised\u201d and \u201cself-harm threat\u201d are discrete incident categories.</p> <p>Transfield Services outlined how reports should be categorised in its <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/316586058/Transfield-Incident-Reporting-Guidelines\">incident management framework of June 2013</a>. <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/08/nu-files/pdfs/matrix.pdf\">An incident reporting matrix from 2014</a><strong> </strong>provides similar guidance.</p> <h2>How accurate are the incident reports and their categorisation?</h2> <p>The way incidents are categorised should be treated with some caution. The private companies that manage the detention centre have extremely poor data handling practices. Some incidents have also been deliberately downgraded in their seriousness. This means that the way incidents are categorised should be examined carefully. There are examples of severe incidents categorised as \u201cinformation\u201d. </p> <p>The risk ratings are applied inconsistently, if at all. Some of the ways the information has been categorised has changed over time, leading to further inconsistencies in counting the data.</p> <p>To present a useful summary of the incident database the Guardian has combined several similar categories, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive\">the original details also preserved in our database</a>. These categories have been clearly marked in our publication of the database. The original incident reports can also be viewed individually and disclose how the information was initially reported.</p> <h2>Has any of the data been changed?</h2> <p><br>The Guardian has redacted personal information in the files it has published. It has also sought to more clearly categorise some types of incident reports by grouping similar types of incidents when the reporting categories have changed over time. For instance, suicidal ideation has been grouped with threatened self-harm. All of the original incident reporting categories have been preserved in the files though, and this grouping has been clearly marked.</p> <h2>What information has been redacted?</h2> <p>The Nauru files contain a large amount of personal information about asylum seekers and detention centre staff. The Guardian has adopted a stringent approach to redacting the documents, including several layers of editorial and technical checks of the data. The general approach we have taken is to remove:<br>\u2022 The names of all asylum seekers and staff<br>\u2022 Personal identification numbers of asylum seekers (their six-digit \u201cboat arrival numbers\u201d)<br>\u2022 Ages of the asylum seekers named in reports<br>\u2022 Signatures of detention staff<br>\u2022 Nationalities with small population groups<br>\u2022 Residential tent numbers<br>\u2022 In some cases further identifying information has been removed</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/10/how-to-contact-the-nauru-files-reporters-securely-and-confidentially\">How to contact the Nauru files reporters securely and confidentially</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This approach to redacting the identities of asylum seekers and staff is consistent with the methodology taken by the former integrity commissioner Philip Moss in his review of sexual assault allegations at the centre.</p> <h2>What common terms and acronyms appear in the files?</h2> <p><strong>NRPC</strong> This acronym refers to the Nauru regional processing centre (the detention centre).</p> <p><strong>SCA</strong> Save the Children Australia, contracted by the Australian government to provide welfare services on the island.</p> <p><strong>IHMS</strong> International Health and Medical Services, contracted to provide health services to asylum seekers.</p> <p><strong>TSA</strong> Transfield Services Australia, contracted to manage the Nauru detention centre.</p> <p><strong>DIBP </strong>Department of Immigration and Border Protection, the Australian government department responsible for overseeing the Nauru detention centre.</p> <p><strong>TIS</strong> Translating and Interpreting Service, a part of the immigration department that provides specialist translation services.</p> <p><strong>CPSW</strong> A Save the Children staff member who is a child protection and support worker</p> <p><strong>CW</strong> A Save the Children caseworker.</p> <p><strong>CM</strong> A Save the Children case manager.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">The Nauru files: 2,000 leaked reports reveal scale of abuse of children in Australian offshore detention</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>CSO</strong> Client services officer.

  "<p>After three days of rancorous competition Olympic swimming needed a good news story. On Tuesday morning it got one. Rami Anis, a 25-year-old from Syria who marched behind the flag of the IOC\u2019s Refugee Team at the opening ceremony, recorded a personal best of 54.25sec in the heats of the 100m freestyle.</p> <p>So for those few minutes at least no one at the Aquatics Centre had a reason to boo and there was something more important to think about than the rights and wrongs of Russian swimming and the way the sport is being run. The previous night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/olympic-swimming-yulia-efimova-fina-fallout\">Yulia Efimova, second in the 100m breaststroke, had said</a> that \u201cusually during the Olympic Games all wars stop\u201d, and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/yuilia-efimova-olympics-critics-cold-war-swimming-lilly-king-rio\">compared her own experience </a>here to a \u201cnew cold war\u201d. Perhaps she should seek out Anis and ask him how he feels about all that.</p> <p>Anis grew up in Aleppo and was always a keen swimmer. He was taught the rudiments by his uncle, Majad, who used to compete for Syria, and he learned more by studying YouTube videos of Michael Phelps.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/05/helplessness-rio-hope-olympic-refugee-team\">From helplessness to hope: inspirational tales of the Refugee Olympic Team</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like Majad Anis grew up to be one of the best swimmers in the country and was bound to be picked for the Syrian team at London 2012. But as the civil war escalated late in 2011, his family decided that he should leave the city to join his elder brother in Istanbul. He did not know then that he would not be coming back, so he packed only a small bag with two jackets, two pairs of trousers, and a couple of T-shirts. \u201cI thought I would be in Turkey for just a couple of months,\u201d he said. He ended up staying for almost four years.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/10/rami-anis-of-refugee-olympic-team-competes-in-swimming-heats-at-rio-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4qbhv\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2646000\"            data-video-name=\"Rami Anis of Refugee Olympic Team competes in swimming heats at Rio \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57aba190e4b024cdec3d65a6\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/10/160810RefugeeSwimming_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/10/160810RefugeeSwimming.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/10/160810RefugeeSwimming_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/10/rami-anis-of-refugee-olympic-team-competes-in-swimming-heats-at-rio-video\">Rami Anis of Refugee Olympic Team competes in swimming heats at Rio</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In Istanbul, Anis would practice at the Galatasaray Sports Club. But because he did not have Turkish citizenship, he was not able to compete in the big events. \u201cIt was like someone who is studying, studying, studying and he can\u2019t take the exam,\u201d he said. When his coach quit, Anis decided he had to move on too. His father had gone on to Belgium, where he was living in a refugee camp. Anis and his younger brother decided to join him there, though it meant they would be leaving their mother and elder brother behind. The journey started with a night-time dinghy trip to the Greek island of Samos in the eastern Aegean, across the Mycale Strait from the Turkish shore. Anis wore his swimming trunks, just in case.</p> <p>Out at sea, the dinghy\u2019s motor broke in the heavy swell. There were 40 people in that dinghy and Anis tried to persuade them all to sing to keep their spirits up. After they finally made it to the shore they stopped for an hour and then started the long trip across the continent. After 10 days of travelling by bus and train they fetched up in Ghent. Anis soon found a new coach, Carine Verbauwen, at the Royal Ghent Swimming Club. She had competed at the Olympics twice herself, in 1976 and 1980. When he decided to try to qualify for the Refugee Team, she worked him mercilessly hard, 17 hours a week, because he had fallen out of shape. It was worth it.</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2016/07/16/the-boats-motor-gave-up-anis-got-ready-to-swim-he-looked-from-ch/\">Anis was selected by the IOC in June</a>, Verbauwen told the press that \u201cif he stayed in Syria, if there was no war, he would have been in the Olympic Games. I think it is justice that he goes.\u201d He was unlikely to get through to the semi-finals, she said, so his aim should be to set a personal best. Eight weeks later he has done exactly that. After the race he was sporting the broadest smile and was delighted with what he had achieved. And he has already been thinking about the next Olympic Games. \u201cIn 2020,\u201d he said, \u201cI hope I will be able to swim under my own flag.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Welcome, then, to the Future (Arena) for a glimpse into the direction global sport is heading. A complex brew of politics, globalisation, sport and money has been distilled and poured into a hastily built and brightly coloured&#xa0;bowl.</p> <p>A Qatar handball team constructed at great expense by importing players from around the world as part of the Gulf state\u2019s ambitious vault on to the world sporting stage is playing a French outfit that are aiming for their third Olympic gold in a row.</p> <p>In the stands, half empty at this early hour, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/09/rio-olympics-2016-day-four-drug-cheat-ban-live\" title=\"\">a sizeable contingent of French fans</a> are waving Tricolours and chanting: \u201c<em>Allez Les Bleus</em>\u201d. Down on the court, the league of nations Qatar squad \u2013 containing only three players born there \u2013 is lustily singing the national anthem.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/17/qatar-world-cup-football-team-migrant-workers\" title=\"\">The majority of them have taken advantage</a> of the lax interpretation of nationality laws in handball to become naturalised in double quick time having been signed to play for Qatari clubs. One of the Qatar players, Bertrand Roine, won a world championship medal with France in 2011 before switching to Doha to play for a club side, Lekhwiya Sports.</p> <p>Meanwhile five of the France squad, including the brilliant Luc Abalo who resembled Plastic Man as he twisted and turned to score seven goals, play for Paris Saint-Germain \u2013 owned, like their footballing cousin, by Qatar Sports Investments. That deal was part of a growing <em>entente cordiale</em> between the interests of the two countries.</p> <p>Missing, according to his goalkeeper Danijel Saric (born in Bosnia-Herzegovina), due to a \u201csmall injury\u201d Roine had to watch as Qatar, who won their opening match against Croatia and were runners-up when they hosted the world championships in 2015, were blown away in the second half.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/09/rio-olympics-2016-day-four-drug-cheat-ban-live\">Rio 2016 Olympics: women's 10m synchro diving final, tennis, football and more \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For some of the French players \u2013 who demonstrated stunning speed, agility and vision to prevail 35-20 after a tightly fought first half \u2013 there is clear resentment at the moneybags approach taken by Qatar. \u201cEvery time we play Qatar, that\u2019s not the vision we have. They can do it, it\u2019s allowed.</p> <p>\u201cBut we take great enjoyment from beating this team, especially in the Olympic Games where you come to represent your country in that spirit,\u201d said Valentin Porte, a 25-year-old right-back who plays his club handball for Montpellier.</p> <p>\u201cThe handball fans are happy when Qatar are beaten because they have that spirit. We play for the love of the game; they play for the money. Everyone has their own view of it.\u201d</p> <p>Others are a bit more reticent, preferring to let their hands do the talking. France\u2019s captain and goalkeeper Vincent Gerard said afterwards: \u201cWe concentrate on the players we\u2019re playing against. That\u2019s how the rules are.\u201d</p> <p>There is a multitude of wider issues at play here that would take a whole book to unpack.</p> <p>But in purely sporting terms the gut-feel test is often a surprisingly effective one. Along the continuum of nationality laws, football sits at one end and sports such as volleyball and handball at the other.</p> <p>Qatar would not be able to do what they have done in handball for the 2022 football World Cup, hence their much longer-term plan involving the Aspire Academy to, they claim, develop their own talent.</p> <p>It is never going to be a black and white debate, as the so-called \u201cPlastic Brits\u201d row before the last Olympics proved. The table tennis competition here is stacked full of Chinese players who have taken up citizenship elsewhere, while the track and field competition next week will throw up more troubling examples.</p> <p>But when almost an entire team is made up of naturalised players, questions are bound to be asked about why a federation is effectively encouraging the practice of switching nations for cash.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s bizarre handball world championships in Doha might provide part of the answer.</p> <p>There Qatar stormed to the final amid a string of controversial refereeing decisions. From the stands they were cheered on by a contingent of Spanish handball fans who had enjoyed an all-expenses paid jaunt to Doha on condition that they backed the home team.</p> <p>It was just one event in a jaw-dropping run of international sporting events across almost every Olympic sport that has characterised Qatar\u2019s dash for success.</p> <p>Yann Hildwein, a journalist for L\u2019Equipe who specialises in handball and volleyball, feels uncomfortable about Qatar\u2019s brazen shopping spree but says the situation is more complex than it might first appear. \u201cThere is respect for the players on the court and the coaches. But this is not the national team. I don\u2019t think the international federation care about that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For Roine, though, he points out that when he moved to Qatar in 2013 he could not get a contract in the French first division. \u201cFor him, it has worked out. I can see why he did it. Of course it will be strange during the anthems,\u201d Hildwein says.</p> <p>The squad, all of whom play their club handball in Qatar, hail variously from Bosnia, Montenegro, Croatia and Cuba. Many have previously played for other nations. All make a far better living in the Gulf than they might at home.</p> <p>Some, such as the Egypt-born pivot Hassen Mabrouk, have even played in the Olympics before for other countries.</p> <p>Some of the other players on the Qatar side are from countries perhaps unlikely to ever qualify a handball team for the Olympics. Ameen Zakkar, for example, is from Syria.</p> <p>\u201cNobody thinks about naturalisation. This is a question for journalists. But we want to play handball, nothing else,\u201d said Saric, the former Barcelona goalkeeper who now faces a crucial match against Tunisia on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cWhat can you get in Europe that you can\u2019t get in Qatar? It\u2019s sunny all the time,\u201d he added, perhaps a touch defensively. Roine told French journalists afterwards that it was a \u201cdream\u201d to play in the Olympics and that he was very happy to be there. But pulling away afterwards on the team bus, he looked a little sad.</p>",
  "<p>Thank you, Zoe Williams, for having the guts to challenge the already solidifying myth about the post-industrial, deprived north being responsible for the Brexit vote (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/07/north-poor-brexit-myths\" title=\"\">Think the north and the poor caused Brexit? Think again</a>, 8 August). A&#xa0;simple analysis of the population geography would show that communities such as Sunderland, Hartlepool and areas of Wales and Lincolnshire are sparsely populated and account for only a small minority of the electorate.</p> <p>It was the towns and counties of the south and south-east with their high turnout of elderly voters who swung the vote. Many Labour MPs think they have to go along with what they think are the anti-immigrant views of their so-called \u201ccore voters\u201d if they are to survive. That is a mistaken perception, fed by the never-ending \u201cvox pop\u201d interviews featured on TV programmes by lazy news reporters. Listen to intelligent journalists like Zoe Williams, and reclaim the debate about how to deal with the impact of immigration on wages, services and working conditions. <br><strong>Richard Crook</strong> <br><em>Brighton</em></p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is partially wrong in her analysis. A wedge of the home counties voted by a majority to remain as well as the big cities. Here in Gloucestershire the more affluent, metropolitan or liberal areas of Cotswolds, Cheltenham and Stroud voted remain while the poorer and more deprived areas of Gloucester, Forest and Tewkesbury voted leave. But margins in all of these places were small. While the Ashcroft exit polls are much quoted in their analysis of voting by age, education and tenure, little exposure has been given to voting figures by socioeconomic group.</p> <p>While those in groups A and B voted in the majority to remain, C1 was evenly divided, C2 D and E \u2013 the working class and approximately half the working population \u2013 when they voted 64% voted leave.

It was a good match.\u201d However, his attention was swiftly drawn to the slightly vexed situation over the mixed doubles. Asked how it was decided that he and Heather Watson would pair up, giving them only a slim chance of playing as they are two outside the cut while his brother, Jamie, and Johanna Konta are guaranteed a start, he said: \u201cThe plan was always that Jamie was going to play with Jo. That was it. Jamie\u2019s a way more experienced doubles player than me. Jo\u2019s playing well too, so I think they have a good chance of winning a medal \u2013 and there is an outside shot that me and Heather could potentially get in as well. But I\u2019ve played a lot of tennis. It\u2019s been really hard to prepare, after the French and Wimbledon. I hadn\u2019t played a match on hard court for five months, and playing every day, two matches in a row every day is not easy on this surface in these conditions. That made the most sense.\u201d</p> <p>He said his early exit from the doubles with Jamie had no bearing on his campaign to win the singles. \u201cIt was a very tough loss. You\u2019ve just got to take it, move on and try your best the next day. I certainly didn\u2019t use it as fuel [for the singles].\u201d</p> <p>Asked again about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/novak-djokovic-rio-2016-juan-martin-del-potro\" title=\"\">Novak Djokovic\u2019s shock defeat</a> by Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, he said: \u201cIt was surprising.

He has pulled out of the Cincinnati Masters without explanation and, having been in line for a calendar slam before losing early at Wimbledon, goes to New York at the end of the month underdone. The Scot struck first against M\u00f3naco. He broke after eight minutes, the Argentinian dropping to his knees and clutching his lower back when wrong-footed by a sharp Murray forehand to the deuce corner. There was no damage \u2013 except to his ego.</p> <p>Holding to love for 3-0, Murray was playing like a man keen to get out of the heat. They swapped breaks in the fifth and sixth games as the world No2 briefly lost focus against an opponent he has beaten three times out of five on the Tour.</p> <p>Up 40-love in the seventh game, Murray double-faulted for a second time before holding and pressing on to take the set in 40 minutes with his fourth ace.</p> <p>The match disintegrated as a contest within a quarter of an hour as Murray broke twice for 4-0, then forged on to the finish line without fuss.</p> <p>Murray entertained the crowd by belting a few balls into the seats, about two-thirds of the 10,000 available being occupied. Much has been made of the tennis being a sellout; if so, there were quite a few people with tickets outside licking ice cream.</p> <p>As he left the court Murray engaged in an extended chat with a young boy who had secured his autograph. The player explained: \u201cI\u2019d taken his pen, so he wanted it back \u2013 and I gave it to him.\u201d In the long history of odd incidents in Murray\u2019s life, that one does probably not make the top 20 \u2013 but he did give the pen back.</p> <p>In the women\u2019s event, Jo Konta beat Svetlana Kuznetsova, the eighth seed, 3-6, 7-5, 7-5 in a struggle of constantly ebbing fortunes to reach the Olympic quarter-finals. The Russian saved match point in the ninth game of the third set and had Konta on the ropes again in the 11th game, before the British No1 held with an ace that kissed the line. Serving to stay in the tournament at 5-6 after three hours, Kuznetsova gave another two match points when she pushed a forehand wide. Again, Konta wasted the chances, also failing to put away a sitter at the net. They fought through four deuce points and another two match points before Konta steadied her nerves to finish the job with a forehand that forced a final wayward response from the Russian. It was not one of Konta\u2019s most fluid performances but it was one of her most impressive in terms of persistence and nerve \u2013 at least at the very end.</p>",

Their nets lie idle, as the quotas for fish have been used up or sold off. Half the fishing boats here won\u2019t be used to fish again. The trade has been forced into other catches. The \u201cquota cops\u201d, with their body-mounted cameras recording everything, oblige the men to account for the crabs and lobsters caught in pots deposited on the sea bed just outside the harbour. As the crustaceans are counted into a leather-bound register, the exasperated fishermen complain of harassment. These may be the men from the British government ministry, but in post-Brexit Britain, perception is everything. In the eyes of Arthur Mole, the inspectors are as much a product of Brussels as a fruit beer or a sprout. The EU is to blame. \u201cWe\u2019ve been like this for 30 years now. On a downward decline.

With that position came lifelong employment and job certainty. I ask if he thinks leaving the EU might bring back the shipyards and the pits: \u201cWe\u2019d like to think so.\u201d He says he knows not one person among the 39% who voted remain.

The promise to save the NHS, migration and trust in Boris Johnson. I meet a former social worker, Shirley Bain, who says that her family\u2019s personal reliance on the NHS meant she was very influenced by the promises to divert EU funding. \u201cIt hit home with me because I\u2019m using the NHS quite a lot at the minute. My son is really, really poorly in hospital and has been in and out since May.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s had a liver transplant and it went wrong, stuff like that \u2013 and where would I have been if I\u2019d had to pay upfront for that? I know I\u2019ve paid with my taxes because I\u2019ve worked all my life. I just think that some of the money we are putting into the EU for other things could be put back into our own NHS.\u201d</p> <p>Shirley invites me to a community centre where she volunteers, which recently had its funding for youth services cut. The \u00a3350m a week could also help reopen them, she says.</p> <p>Fellow volunteer Peta McDowall, a remain voter, suggests to her the figure was a lie. Peta considers herself a product of Europe \u2013 her parents arrived during the Spanish civil war and she attended university in Europe.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was about politics. I think the people who are in Brexit are idiots. I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean you, Shirley, I mean the head people. When I found out who was our minister for world affairs [Boris Johnson], it\u2019s a joke.\u201d Shirley seems genuinely worried that the \u00a3350m number might not be true. She resolves to charter a bus with Peta from the north-east to meet the new foreign secretary. \u201cI would go mad if this money doesn\u2019t go into the NHS, I will go mad.

They thought this is a chance for them to hear our voice,\u201d he says. His wife, Theresa, says that council cutbacks played a big part. John is a rare thing in this city \u2013 a Conservative. But on this occasion, his vote mattered.</p> <p>On the night, when the presumption had been that remain would win, Conservative cabinet ministers started to report a similar phenomenon. \u201cLabour\u201d wards in Tory safe seats, where no party would bother to visit during a general election, were seeing massive turnout. Overall, 2.8m more votes were cast on 23 June than at the general election last year. Turnout spiked particularly in strongly leave areas. In the north-east, Hartlepool (70% leave) saw turnout up by 9%, as did Sunderland. Middlesborough (66% leave) saw turnout up by 12%.</p> <p>Just under 20,000 of those new voters were in Sunderland. One of them, Melanie Jordison, a travel agent, was in the Colliery. \u201cIt was something very real. A choice to stay or leave \u2013 and both had impacts, whereas in general elections there is no impact, so I thought it a good opportunity to make Britain great again,\u201d she says. She is expecting cheaper food, gas and oil, and wants to close down the borders \u201ca little bit\u201d because \u201cfar too many immigrants [are] coming in taking our resources. We can\u2019t afford to feed our own.\u201d</p> <p>The main story on the leave side has been of a left-behind Britain of ignored white middle-class voters who wanted control over borders back and were inured to David Cameron\u2019s \u201cProject Fear\u201d economic scaremongering. On the remain side, Sunderland became the symbol of a Labour heartland encouraged to shoot itself in the foot, with a gun handed to them by Conservative cabinet ministers and loaded with lies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/jul/06/sunderland-echo-wrong-to-demand-an-apology-from-the-new-york-times\">Sunderland Echo wrong to demand an apology from the New York Times</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Politics defies simple narratives most of the time, and spectacularly so right now. I meet leavers completely relaxed about immigration. Car workers who voted out. Fishing industry workers who voted remain.</p> <p>If politics was done solely by numbers, there should have been no contest in the north-east. The region is the most dependent on EU funding of any English region \u2013 from the new aquatics centre on the old colliery site, to the university near the old shipyards, and the very fish quay building from where the fisherman lament the EU. The leave campaign promised the funding will be maintained, saying it is merely rerouted UK taxpayer funds, but the dependence will move to Westminster to continue this funding.</p> <p>On the signature issue of the Leave campaign \u2013 immigration \u2013 the north-east is the region with the smallest proportion of non-British residents: 3%. Figures from 2014 estimated there to be 40,000 European Union migrants and 42,000 non-EU migrants in the region, out of a total population of 2.5 million.</p> <p>If you concentrate on a place such as Sunderland, the migration crisis is rather stark. At the last census, Sunderland had the fastest rate of depopulation of any UK city. Since the 1980s, 8% of its population has gone. The success of the university in attracting international students has helped stabilise the decline in recent years, but its business model is built on increasing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/uk-population-grew-half-million-net-migration-ons\">net migration numbers</a> that the government found so difficult to defend.</p> <p>At the very least, it is difficult to see how places such as Sunderland will be greatly affected by less EU migration, when the numbers are very small by the standards of a British city. On the other hand, any risk to the terms of trade between the UK and the remaining EU will hit the north-east first: in per-capita terms, it does more trade with the EU than any other English region. The north-east appears to be shouldering a disproportionate amount of the economic risk of a badly negotiated Brexit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb5f9ad59614c6a05ead3c60aabef28b6fdd9605\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb5f9ad59614c6a05ead3c60aabef28b6fdd9605/0_154_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On the production line at the Nissan plant in Sunderland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018That Nissan plant is never, ever going to leave Sunderland,\u2019 says one Leave voter \u2013 but Nissan have said its future depends on how Brexit plays out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But politics is not done by numbers these days, still less by experts. For starters, there was little perception of any <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/05/nissan-warns-sunderland-uk-car-plant-hinges-brexit-talks\">risk to the Nissan plant</a>. Back at the fishing quay, the trader buying all the crabs and lobsters, Alan McLaughlan, asserts: \u201cThat Nissan plant is never, ever going to leave Sunderland. They\u2019ll never, ever get a workforce like they\u2019ve got in Sunderland, never ever.\u201d But perhaps the best example of this are the workers in local supply chains for the industry who voted to leave. James Thoroughgood, a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, voted out despite job concerns, because the EU \u201cneeds to be transparent\u201d. Before the vote, David Cameron had told me directly that Brexit could cause job losses at Nissan and that it would be a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d. Thoroughgood says such warnings were ignored: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got nothing at all, and you are offered to stay where we are because we don\u2019t know what is around the corner, people with nothing will go around the corner every time. What have they got to lose? I think there are lot of people in this area like that.\u201d</p> <p>Vote Leave felt sufficiently confident that it even put Nissan\u2019s logo on its leaflets, despite the threat of court action. But the risk is apparent. The history of the plant is difficult to escape. It only exists because <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8253169.stm\">Margaret Thatcher went to Japan in 1982</a> and visited the Nissan chiefs, personally assuring them of access for their cars to an embryonic British invention \u2013 Europe\u2019s single market. She then went into battle for Nissan against French and Italian attempts to block tariff-free exports of the Sunderland-produced Nissan Bluebird. She helped establish the Nissan as a European car, designed for export into Europe and getting around strict quotas for Japanese imports in the face of French opposition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/05/nissan-warns-sunderland-uk-car-plant-hinges-brexit-talks\">Nissan warns future of UK car plant hinges on Brexit talks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the most influential businessmen in the city\u2019s history will only talk to me off the record.

They have to if they want full immigration controls. And yet the impact of that extra border control will probably be mainly felt in London and the bigger cities \u2013 and, mainly, those places did not vote for it.</p> <p>He points me to a song about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/the-northerner/2015/nov/06/jarrow-march-unemployed-1936\">Jarrow Crusade march</a> for jobs, down the road. \u201cIf they don\u2019t give you a decent job, then with my blessing, burn them down.\u201d That was a song from the Geordie side of the Newcastle/Sunderland divide. \u201cThe \u2018them\u2019 here is \u2018London Town\u2019, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done with the leave vote,\u201d he tells me.</p> <p>The common thread among everyone I spoke to was that this was a revolt against London, or perhaps, more specifically, the rest of the country becoming like London.

But all other lines of inquiry remain open \u2013 including possible links to the beauty pageant \u2013 according to the Sinaloa\u2019s chief prosecutor. </p> <p>The attack took place in the state capital, Culiacan, just hours after Castellanos awarded Melissa Carolina Liz\u00e1rraga the Miss Sinaloa crown. </p> <p>Beauty pageants in Mexico have long been connected to the criminal underworld.

It was alleged that Flores, who was the reigning Miss Woman Sinaloa at the time, was the girlfriend of a cartel leader.</p> <p>In 2007, Guzm\u00e1n, leader of the notorious Sinaloa cartel, married Emma Coronel, winner of a small-town pageant in the Sinaloan Mountains, on her 18th birthday. </p> <p>The relationship between the drugs trade and Mexico\u2019s beauty contests was dramatized in a critically acclaimed 2011 Mexican film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/144135/miss-bala\">Miss Bala</a>, which told the story of a young woman competing for Miss Baja California who becomes an unwilling accomplice in a drug-running ring and is eventually arrested.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/27/mexico-beauty-queen-shot-drugs\">Mexican beauty queen killed in drugs shootout</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Violence has soared in the north-west state of Sinaloa since Guzm\u00e1n was recaptured in January, six months after his audacious escape from a high security prison through a tunnel. </p> <p>The escalation in violence has been attributed to a turf war as rival cartels try to wrest control of the region from the Sinaloa cartel. </p> <p>In June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/16/el-chapo-mother-house-looted-gunmen-drug-cartel\">dozens of heavily armed men stormed Guzman\u2019s hometown, La Tuna</a>, and looted the house of his 86-year-old mother, sparking speculation that his authority was plummeting. </p> <p>So far there is no evidence that Castellanos\u2019s murder was linked to organised crime. </p> <p>He moved to Mexico\u2019s second-biggest city, Guadalajara, from his hometown of Tampico, Tamaulipas, as a teenager <a href=\"http://aristeguinoticias.com/0908/mexico/quien-era-el-director-de-miss-world-mexico-asesinado-en-culiacan/ \">to pursue a modelling career</a>.

  "<p>The shadow home secretary, Andy Burnham, has said he would not be afraid of \u201cchallenging or contradicting\u201d national Labour policy if he were elected mayor of Greater Manchester in May 2017.</p> <p>Speaking after he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/andy-burnham-selected-labours-candidate-manchester-mayor\">declared the party\u2019s candidate</a> for the role, the MP for Leigh said he would not hesitate to take different policy positions to the Labour leader if it was the right thing for people living in the region.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d always be respectful of the position of the leader of the party, but my primary job will be to represent the people of Greater Manchester and to make their voices heard on the national stage even if that means at times challenging or contradicting national Labour policy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Burnham won 51% of a vote from party members in the region, beating the area\u2019s police and crime commissioner and interim mayor, Tony Lloyd (29%), and the MP for Bury South, Ivan Lewis, who was a government minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown (19.8%). Burnham won the contest with 3,792 votes to Lloyd\u2019s 2,163 and Lewis\u2019s 1,472, on a turnout of 65.3%.</p> <p>The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, congratulated Burnham on his victory, saying the mayoral race would be an opportunity for Labour to take its message of social justice to the region\u2019s 2 million voters in next year\u2019s election. </p> <p>The shadow home secretary said he would stand down as an MP at the \u201cfirst and earliest opportunity\u201d if he won the race to become mayor next May, as appears likely given that almost all of Manchester\u2019s council seats are filled by Labour.</p> <p>Asked during a press conference after the announcement whether he would resign from the shadow cabinet, Burnham said: \u201cNext month there will be a decision on the leadership of our party going forward and it will then be for the leader of the party to decide whether or not I remain in the shadow cabinet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think Labour does need to break out of its Westminster-centric mode,\u201d Burnham later told the Guardian. \u201cI\u2019m standing in this to give Labour a stronger northern identity, to stop our voice being drowned out by Scotland \u2013 which is what I perceive to have been happening in recent times \u2013 and to put Labour back in touch with the voters that we\u2019ve lost here.</p> <p>\u201cI see this as a crucial part of Labour\u2019s rejuvenation in the long term going back to the grass roots, because I don\u2019t see Westminster Labour coming up with the solutions any time soon.\u201d</p> <p>The shadow home secretary said the \u201cLondon perspective on life\u201d dominated British political debate and had left many people feeling abandoned. </p> <p>\u201cPeople voted leave [in the EU referendum] for a whole complicated set of reasons, with that being one of them. Mainstream political parties will not get many chances to respond to what people are saying before they look elsewhere.\u201d <br></p> <p>Despite having been an MP for 15 years, and a frontbencher for about eight of those years, Burnham denied that he was part of the Westminster bubble he claimed to oppose. \u201cIn the cabinet pre-2010, I was speaking about the failure to respond to legitimate concerns on immigration,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cI stood in 2010 for the leadership complaining about a London-centric Labour party and I did it again last year. I don\u2019t think people can accuse me of always being part of the club \u2026 I\u2019ve always criticised it and challenged it.\u201d</p> <p>If he were to win in May and relocate from Westminster, the mayoral hopeful said he would miss his many friends and the power parliament affords to effect change quickly. \u201cBut I won\u2019t miss the slight snobbery of the place, the slight dislike of accents, the old-school ways of doing things, the Oxbridge and public school atmosphere,\u201d Burnham added.</p> <p>The creation of elected mayors is a condition of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/03/the-guardian-view-on-english-devolution-grab-the-chance\">series of devolution arrangements</a> agreed by the former chancellor George Osborne and a series of \u201cmetro\u201d regions, including the West Midlands, Greater Manchester, the Liverpool and Sheffield city regions, the Tees valley, the north-east, and Greater Lincolnshire.</p> <p>The mayor of Greater Manchester, a city region with a population of 3.5 million which covers Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan, will have control over a portfolio of public services and a \u00a3900m, 30-year investment fund, and will sit on a board that oversees a devolved \u00a36bn health and social care budget.</p> <p>Voting to select Labour\u2019s candidates in Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and the Liverpool city region closed at 12pm on Friday. To be eligible to vote, Labour members were required to live in the relevant city region and have been a member of the party before 19 July 2015, a rule that has excluded a high proportion of the party\u2019s new membership. The poll was conducted using the alternative vote system, and votes were cast by post and online.</p>",

  "<p>A sectarian dispute in Pakistan was played out in Glasgow when Bradford taxi driver Tanveer Ahmed stabbed shopkeeper Asad Shah to death in a religiously motivated murder.</p> <p>Simmering hatred towards Britain\u2019s Ahmadiyya Muslim community spilled over into violence the day before Good Friday this year when Shah was murdered in his shop by Ahmed, who remained defiant even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/tanveer-ahmed-jailed-for-murder-glasgow-shopkeeper-in-sectarian-attack\">as he was sentenced on Tuesday</a>. </p> <p>Ahmed, a Sunni Muslim, was offended by Shah\u2019s religious proclamations on social media. On Wednesday morning, as Ahmed was being taken down to the cells after being jailed for a minimum of 27 years, there were chants from his supporters in the public gallery, and he shouted: \u201cMuhammad is the prophet, he is the only one.\u201d</p> <p>Shah, whose final Facebook update, posted a few hours before his death, had offered Easter greetings \u201cto my beloved Christian nation\u201d, was a member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community. This minority group faces persecution \u2013 most recently in Pakistan and Indonesia \u2013 and is treated with open hostility by many orthodox Muslims because it differs from their belief that Muhammad is the final prophet.</p> <p>Some who identified themselves as friends or extended family of Shah\u2019s 32-year-old murderer Ahmed, whom the Guardian spoke to in Bradford, refused to condemn the killing and claimed that he was driven to commit it by events unfolding thousands of miles away in his home country of Pakistan. </p> <p>The father of three, who came to Britain on a marriage visa more than a decade ago, was a staunch supporter of Islamic fundamentalist Mumtaz Qadri.</p> <p>Qadri, a policeman and bodyguard, was hanged in Pakistan for the murder of Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab, who campaigned against its blasphemy laws as well as Ahmadi persecution.<br></p> <p>The 2011 murder of Taseer was one of Pakistan\u2019s most high-profile assassinations. The prominent liberal politician was an outspoken critic of the country\u2019s harsh blasphemy laws, arguing that they discriminated against religious minorities, and sought liberal reforms. He had called for a pardon for Asia Bibi, a Christian woman who was sentenced to death in 2010 for insulting the prophet Muhammad.<br></p> <p>Taseer claimed Pakistan\u2019s blasphemy laws were used primarily to terrorise and exact revenge on religious minorities there: from Shias and Ahmadis to Hindus and Sikhs. Yet, for some living in the UK, Taseer was a divisive figure and after his murder some hailed his killer Qadri as a hero. Ahmed was among this tranche of supporters. <br></p> <p>Friends said Ahmed became increasingly vocal about his support of Qadri. Living with his wife, Razia, and three children in the Gurlington area of Bradford, Ahmed would preach to friends about those he believed were committing blasphemy.</p> <p>Ahmed, who does not speak fluent English, is understood to have become aware of Shah online after the shopkeeper posted what he believed to be contentious comments. Just before murdering Shah it is understood Ahmed was offended by a remark Shah made where he allegedly purported to be a prophet of Islam.<br></p> <p>In a chilling turn of events Ahmed called Shah in the days before he murdered him. Ahmed\u2019s friends said the two men had a heated discussion with Ahmed asking Shah to take back his assertion that he was a prophet. The pair also discussed the recent events in Pakistan.<br></p> <p>The night before Good Friday, Ahmed travelled more than 200 miles to Glasgow and stabbed Shah to death.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the killing pockets of support were identified for Ahmed with a Facebook group set up. The page has since been taken down but when the Guardian visited Ahmed\u2019s home city some members of the community still supported his actions. </p> <p>One person, who refused to be named, claimed the shopkeeper \u201cshould not have been able to get away with\u201d his actions. </p> <p>In a highly unusual move, following his second court appearance in April, Ahmed released a statement through his lawyer claiming that he had killed Shah because he disrespected Islam, stating: \u201cThis all happened for one reason and no other issues and no other intentions. Asad Shah disrespected the messenger of Islam, the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.\u201d</p> <p>A friend of Ahmed, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said: \u201cThey rang Shah to discuss what he had been saying about the prophet. They told him what he said was wrong and told him to take his words back. It is a big sin to say the things he did and they talked about this dream he had about being a prophet and told him it was wrong.\u201d<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cWe didn\u2019t think Tanveer would do this but you will find that many people have a lot of sympathy for him over here.\u201d<br></p> <p>It has been claimed that hate preaching against the UK\u2019s Ahmadi community is an increasing concern. </p> <p>Lawyer Farooq Aftab told the Guardian earlier this year: \u201cIt is a growing phenomenon: shops boycotted, women assaulted, even my friends who are educated won\u2019t eat with me now. The simple answer: it\u2019s because you\u2019re not a Muslim. We\u2019ve gone through university together, we ate together, prayed together ...\u201d <br></p>",

And he can thank the freak show that is Donald Trump\u2019s Republican party for restoring his stature as a unifying, national leader with a moderated and mature approach to a complex and unstable world.</p> <p>Eight years ago, Obama represented an existential threat to the Republican party, and not just because he was going to lead the Democratic party to win the White House and Congress by large margins.</p> <p>No, Obama\u2019s biggest threat was that he could realign American politics, shifting it fundamentally towards progressives for a generation. He and his campaign aides talked privately of being the Reagan of the left: a transformative figure who would leave an indelible legislative mark at home and restore America\u2019s position on the world stage.</p> <p>With his appeal to independents and moderate Republicans, Obama could break the Republican party as a national force. With his appeal to minority voters \u2013 a rapidly emerging majority across the country \u2013 he could lock in the fastest growing demographics that could turn red states blue.</p> <p>So the GOP leadership chose to make Obama unacceptable, unpalatable and un-American. On the night of his first inauguration, House Republican leaders met at a Washington steakhouse to plot their path back to power. They would not reform their policies or consider the root cause of their defeat. Instead, they would oppose Obama on everything, well before he tried to pass a giant stimulus bill or healthcare reform.</p> <p>They needed to deny him a reputation for bipartisanship and mainstream politics, and they succeeded. He wasn\u2019t reasonable; he was an ideologue. His vision of healthcare reform wasn\u2019t a free-market system based on Republican plans; it was a socialist takeover that would destroy the American way of life. He was inviting terrorist attacks on the homeland, not hunting down Osama bin Laden. He was acting in unconstitutional ways because he wasn\u2019t really American at all.</p> <p>The party of Sarah Palin, Herman Cain, Michele Bachmann and Roger Ailes had turned him into their own kind of freak.</p> <p>Before he finished his second year in office, Obama was such an object of Republican loathing that the Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell could say \u2013 with impunity \u2013 that \u201cthe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\u201d</p> <p>If your political priorities are the total defeat of a single politician \u2013 not the advancement of your own policies through debate or legislation \u2013 then you are already in pretty desperate shape.

Republican candidates are saying they will not vote for their presidential nominee, and the party\u2019s national security officials are lining up to condemn Trump as a reckless danger to the Republic. How could the incumbent not look like a statesman compared to a man who apparently can\u2019t be trusted with <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/31/politics/trump-elevator-rescue/\">the elevator button</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/national-security-gop-donald-trump.html?_r=0\">never mind a nuclear one</a>?</p> <p>Inside the White House, Obama\u2019s aides talk about a president liberated from previous constraint. On the trail, and at the podium, he seems to love campaigning against his orange nemesis. His party\u2019s candidates can\u2019t get enough of him, and his potential successor \u2013 instead of putting distance between them \u2013 believes Obama doesn\u2019t get enough credit for his economic achievements.</p> <p>This one-term president is having an unusually successful end to his second term, and for that he can thank the Republicans who were so determined to destroy him.</p>",

It would shift the balance, which is not necessarily in Norway\u2019s interests.\u201d </p> <p>She also confirmed that the UK could only join if there were unanimous agreement, thereby providing Norway with a veto. Aspaker said she did not know the UK\u2019s plans.</p> <p>EEA membership requires the four EU freedoms: free movement of persons, services, goods and capital. Norway, in need of extra labour, does not oppose free movement, though the issue of asylum seekers and refugees is controversial.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/future-eu/news/bratislava-to-host-first-summit-on-eus-future/\">EU special summit</a> in Bratislava in September and the Conservative party conference in October may provide greater clarity on the British government\u2019s thinking, Aspaker said.<br></p> <p>One concern is that Norway, through Efta, has signed trade agreements with 38 countries, including Mexico, Canada, Colombia, Morocco, Kuwait and Qatar.

A source joked that the country might lose its superpower status in Efta, were this to occur. The combined population of current Efta nations is 14 million, compared with the UK population of 65 million.</p> <p>Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, the leader of Norway\u2019s Centre party, has accused the government of dawdling in responding to the Brexit vote, saying it needs to be proactive in defending Norwegian interests.</p> <p>Audun Lysbakken, the leader of Norway\u2019s Socialist Left party, has argued that the EEA agreement should be renegotiated with the UK\u2019s help, saying countries \u201coutside need a better model for cooperation with the EU than the current EEA agreement\u201d. </p> <p>He said he was amazed that his government did not want to have an open debate about a new relationship with the EU. \u201cThroughout the spring, the government has been adamant that the EEA is not a good model and it is not something they would recommend to the British.

The film\u2019s most apt comparison is probably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/31/guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-marvel-superheroes\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>, because both comic-book properties were little known to broad audiences until their respective owners, Warner/DC and Disney/Marvel, announced movie adaptations.

A case in point is Finding Dory, which debuted a week ago with \u00a38.12m and added another \u00a33.98m at the weekend. The film\u2019s cumulative total is \u00a320.25m, which means it grossed \u00a38.15m during the Monday-to-Thursday period. Over its first 10 days, the daily average gross is an impressive \u00a32.03m.</p> <p>Among Pixar films, only Toy Story 3 reached \u00a320m at a quicker pace. In fact, Finding Dory has already exceeded the lifetime grosses of the three Pixar titles (Cars, Cars 2 and The Good Dinosaur), and is closing in on Brave (\u00a322.2m), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/18/animation\">WALL-E</a> (\u00a322.9m) and Ratatouille (\u00a324.8m).</p> <p>Universal/Illumination\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/23/secret-life-pets-film-review-family-animation-new-york\">The Secret Life of Pets</a> remains the biggest-grossing animated film of 2016 so far, with \u00a332.1m.

Cinema programmers now have their hopes pinned on a quartet of wide new releases, beginning on Wednesday with the comedy Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates, starring Zac Efron, Adam DeVine, Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza. Teen-skewing thriller Nerve (which may lose some of its potential audience due to a 15 rating) follows on Thursday. On Friday arrives shark-peril thriller The Shallows, starring Blake Lively, and Disney remake Pete\u2019s Dragon. Indie cinemas, which are crying out for an indie hit, and many of which are currently playing wall-to-wall summer blockbusters \u2013 will be welcoming Todd Solondz comedy Wiener-Dog.

  "<p>Researchers have discovered the wreck of a pioneering British steamship that sank in the Russian Arctic in 1878.</p> <p>The Thames was a 120-tonne steamship captained by decorated explorer Joseph Wiggins during his attempts to open a trade route between the UK and Siberia through the Arctic Ocean. Two researchers from the <a href=\"https://www.rgo.ru/ru/article/gde-temza-vstrechaetsya-s-eniseem\">Russian Geographical Society,</a> which is chaired by President Vladimir Putin, found its wreck in shallow waters on the Yenisei river near the village of Goroshikha just south of the Arctic Circle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/sep/16/climatechange\">Arctic thaw opens fabled trade route</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ship was the first ocean vessel to enter the Yenisei, the largest river flowing into the Arctic, and one of the first to navigate the North-east Passage shipping route.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99d413b8182c4780af4aab7fd704dab8f4c1b4e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99d413b8182c4780af4aab7fd704dab8f4c1b4e5/0_109_720_432/500.jpg\" alt=\"Captain Joseph Wiggins was an early believer in the possibilities of sea trade with Siberia.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Captain Joseph Wiggins was an early believer in the possibilities of sea trade with Siberia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Siberian State Aerospace University</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say how well the steamship was preserved.

As climate change rapidly warms the Arctic, Russia has been staking its claim to the region\u2019s trade routes and oil and gas reserves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/shipwreck-zip/giv-31075oi13IJdKblQ5\" data-alt=\"Map of the discovery of The Thames in Siberia\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/shipwreck-zip/giv-31075oi13IJdKblQ5\">Map of the discovery of The Thames in Siberia</a> </figure>  <p>Wiggins was an early believer in the possibilities of sea trade with Siberia, which was rich in timber, furs, coal and even mammoth bones. Going against the conventional wisdom that ice cover made the Arctic route unnavigable, the merchant captain self-financed an expedition to the Gulf of Ob in 1874, proving the Kara Sea was passable. Journalist-explorer Henry Morton Stanley, who was already famous for finding missionary David Livingstone in eastern Africa, had sought to <a href=\"http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic47-4-405.pdf\">accompany this expedition</a> but was refused permission by his employer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19441698bb32b215da1e593b4bca67567aff20a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19441698bb32b215da1e593b4bca67567aff20a4/0_0_1280_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the expedition in their catamaran.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the expedition in their catamaran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julia Komissarenko/RGO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Undeterred by a failed mission in 1875 and backed by new investors, Wiggins reached the Yenisei in The Thames in 1876 and left the ship to winter on the river. According to the Russian Geographical Society, he tried to <a href=\"https://www.rgo.ru/ru/article/gde-temza-vstrechaetsya-s-eniseem\">continue</a> upriver the next year but the ship ran aground and froze to the bottom. He was forced to sell it for parts and return to Britain overland, and The Thames sank during the spring thaw in 1878.</p> <p>Later that year, Wiggins sailed to the Gulf of Ob and brought back a shipment of wheat, the first Siberian produce to be transported to Britain through the Kara Sea. Although development of Arctic sea trade with Russia was hindered by shipwrecks, Wiggins was honoured by Emperor Alexander III in St Petersburg after he transported rails for the Trans-Siberian railway up the Yenisei in 1893. The Royal Geographical Society recognised his work to open the Kara Sea route with the 1894 Murchison award.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"db15118e5fcad9a9b2b465a144ac2de2d2351676\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db15118e5fcad9a9b2b465a144ac2de2d2351676/121_165_1651_2063/800.jpg\" alt=\"Journalist-explorer Sir Henry Morton Stanley was refused permission to accompany Wiggins.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Journalist-explorer Sir Henry Morton Stanley was refused permission to accompany Wiggins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Russian Geographical Society researchers also discovered what they believe to be the wreck of the Russian schooner Northern Lights when a storm forced their motorised catamaran on to the largest of the Brekhovsky islands in the Yenisei Gulf. Four of six crew members died of scurvy after the ship was forced to winter there in 1876, and it was wrecked during the spring thaw. Its remains are a rare example of Siberian shipbuilding of the era, Goncharov said.</p>",

In the UK there is no available data, but Gerrard tells me that, anecdotally, more women are asking for their children to be present at birth.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big thing in the UK, and it probably isn\u2019t something midwives encouraged in the last 20 years,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it is on the increase.

  "<p>Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan held a clear-the-air summit in St Petersburg on Tuesday, the first time the pair have met since they fell out over the Russian fighter jet downed by the Turkish air force last November. After more than three hours of talks, the two leaders promised to return their economic relations to \u201cpre-crisis\u201d levels and attempt to put the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/08/putin-and-erdogan-to-have-first-meeting-since-jet-downing\">bad blood</a> of the past nine months behind them.</p> <p>The visit was also Erdo\u011fan\u2019s first trip abroad since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/turkey-coup-attempt-president-declares-his-government-remains-in-charge\">failed coup</a> attempt in Turkey last month, and in his opening remarks he thanked Putin for his support. \u201cYour call straight after the coup was very pleasing for me and our leadership and our people,\u201d said the Turkish president, who referred to Putin as \u201cmy dear friend\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is our principled position,\u201d Putin said, in regard to the coup attempt. \u201cWe are always categorically opposed to any attempts at anti-constitutional activity. I want to express the hope that under your leadership the Turkish people will deal with this, and justice and legality will prevail.\u201d</p> <p>Western leaders have criticised Turkey for the crackdown in the aftermath of the coup, and for suggestions by Erdo\u011fan that the death penalty could be reintroduced. Erdo\u011fan has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/02/the-west-is-supporting-terrorism-against-turkey-claims-erdogan\">strongly critical</a> of the EU and US response to the coup attempt, and there is a sense that Putin may have seen an opportunity to provide a supportive shoulder for the Turkish leader, despite the rancour of the past months.</p> <p>In November, Turkey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/24/turkey-shoots-down-jet-near-border-with-syria\">shot down</a> a Russian Su-24 fighter jet, after what it said were multiple warnings to leave Turkish airspace. Russia insisted the plane remained inside Syrian airspace, where it was flying missions in support of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime. One of the pilots died, as well as a marine who was part of a rescue mission. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/nov/24/russian-fighter-jet-shot-down-near-turkey-syria-border-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4ef95\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2412509\"            data-video-name=\"Russian fighter jet shot down near Turkey-Syria border \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Anadolu Agency\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56542d23e4b0877f6541edc9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/11/24/151124TurkeySyria2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/11/24/151124TurkeySyria2_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/11/24/151124TurkeySyria2_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/11/24/151124TurkeySyria2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/11/24/151124TurkeySyria2_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/nov/24/russian-fighter-jet-shot-down-near-turkey-syria-border-video\">Russian fighter jet shot down near Turkey-Syria border</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In the aftermath of the incident, Russia imposed economic sanctions on Turkey, a number of Turks were deported, and charter flights between the two countries stopped. Millions of Russians had been used to going on holiday to Turkey, and the frost in relations came as a huge blow to the country\u2019s tourist industry. <br></p> <p>Russia\u2019s minister for economic development, Alexey Ulyukayev, said bilateral trade could reach the same levels as before the sanctions \u201cwithin a year\u201d. Putin also promised the gradual easing of sanctions, the resumption of charter flights, and possibly the lifting of visas, imposed for Turkish citizens after the incident.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan and Putin, both strong leaders who have portrayed their rule as a time of national renaissance, previously had a very good personal relationship. While it is unlikely they will immediately return to business as usual, both appeared keen to put the plane incident behind them, after Erdo\u011fan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/27/kremlin-says-erdogan-apologises-russian-jet-turkish\">wrote a letter</a> to the Russian president in June in which he expressed regret for the incident.<br></p> <p>The plane was mentioned on Tuesday but kept in the background. Erdo\u011fan spoke of the \u201cwell-known incident last year\u201d, while Putin referred to \u201cthe tragic incident involving the death of our servicemen\u201d during his opening remarks, a far cry from his words in the immediate aftermath, when he called the downing \u201ca stab in the back, carried out by the accomplices of terrorists\u201d.</p> <p>An aide to Erdo\u011fan told Turkey\u2019s H\u00fcrriyet newspaper that the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, and a Turkish businessman with major interests in Russia had played go-between roles to smooth over the bad feelings after the plane incident.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis visit seems to me a new milestone in bilateral relations, beginning with a clean slate, and I personally, with all my heart and on behalf of the Turkish nation salute Mr Putin and all Russians,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said in an interview with Russian state media on the eve of his visit.</p> <p>The rapprochement between Erdo\u011fan and Putin has jangled nerves in Brussels. MEPs recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/20/turkeys-long-road-to-eu-membership-just-got-longer\">warned about the Putinisation of Turkey</a>, amid concern over the sweeping crackdown on suspected coup plotters in the civil service and judiciary.<br></p> <p>But Turkey\u2019s ambassador to the EU, Selim Yenel, said he was \u201csurprised by the worry I see in many western countries\u201d over the St Petersburg visit. \u201cTurn back the clock one year, we had even stronger relations with Russia at that time,\u201d he told the Guardian. It was unrealistic to think Turkey would turn against western countries or Nato, he said.<br></p> <p>Erdo\u011fan has vowed Turkey will reject a key EU demand of rewriting its terrorism laws in return for visa-free travel to Europe \u2013 leaving the migration pact between the EU and Turkey hanging by a thread. Despite this warning, senior EU and Turkish officials have continued to search for agreement on visa-free travel, and the ambassador voiced optimism that pact would hold.<br></p>",

I am paler than most lily-white Americans, I live in a leafy suburb, and my English is better than my Spanish. There\u2019s also the small detail that I do not remember my own immigration. </p> <p> I came to the US shortly after my first birthday, on an American Airlines flight from El Dorado airport in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, to Dulles international airport in the suburbs of Washington DC, in 1999. My parents were both professionals with graduate degrees. My father was moving from a job in a management consultancy in Bogot\u00e1 to one near Washington. I had been born in Bogot\u00e1 to a Colombian mother, from the Caribbean city of Barranquilla, and a Colombian American father whose early life acted as a mirror to mine. While I was born in Bogot\u00e1 and raised in Washington DC, he was born in Washington DC and raised in Bogot\u00e1. </p> <p> My grandparents were part of the politically active professional class of Colombia, and both my parents went to university in the US. Before I was born, they had lived in Paris for three years before moving back to Colombia for my father\u2019s job. It was there that I was born. </p> <p> Colombia at the time was not the Colombia of today. It was not a country to which you would see package vacations advertised in the New York Times. Violence due to drug cartels, fascist paramilitaries and communist guerrillas was still rife. My parents must have known that, but they had been away from the country for a while. My father thought that a normal life in Colombia, as they had lived in Paris, was possible. But when my mother heard that blue corneas had a market value, she decided that Colombia was not the place to raise her blue-eyed son. It was at her insistence that my parents moved, with me, to Washington. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/26/muslim-doctor-christian-patient-pakistan\">I am a Muslim doctor.

I never experienced the struggle of learning a new language or fitting into a new culture. My mother became a US citizen in 2004 in order to vote for John Kerry, and apart from occasional trips to visit relatives in Colombia, we were as American a family as any of our white, mainly Wasp neighbors. </p> <p> It was only in high school that I fully understood what it meant when I said that I was from Colombia. Before then, those who asked me tended to be my peers, who had no pre-formed notions of what a Colombian should be, or adults who knew my parents. But adolescence awakens adulthood, and it was in high school that I became conscious that I was an immigrant. People began to say: \u201cYou don\u2019t look Colombian\u201d or \u201cYou don\u2019t look Hispanic.\u201d They did not mean any harm, and didn\u2019t cause any either. </p> <p> It was also in high school that I met immigrants who remembered their home countries. People from Colombia who spoke with accents utterly distinct to my bland mid-Atlantic English, who could roll their Rs, and who knew the neighborhoods of the city where I had always said I was from. </p> <p>Most of my friendship group did not include these newcomers. I had friends from middle school, and as high school progressed I stayed in the same, mainly white, milieu. I took SAT prep courses, fencing, advanced classes \u2013 in short, everything you would expect from a teen from upper middle-class American suburbia who is aiming for the Ivies. Not that I have no Hispanic friends; I do. They just tend to be as highly assimilated as I am. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/19/immigrant-who-chose-be-wrong-kind-doctor-academic\">I was an immigrant who chose to be the wrong kind of doctor: an academic | Mita Choudhury</a> </p> </aside>  <p> I am an immigrant.

  "<p>For much of his long acting career on television and in movies, David Huddle- ston, who has died aged 85, was one of those outstanding know-the-face-not-the-name character actors. However, for many cinephiles, his name had already come into focus by the time his career reached its apogee with the Coen brothers\u2019 film The Big Lebowski (1998), in which Huddleston played the title role.</p> <p>Lebowski was the millionaire phil- anthropist who shares his name with Jeff Lebowski, an ageing hippy known as \u201cthe Dude\u201d, played by Jeff Bridges. This leads to confusion when the Dude is mistaken for his namesake by two heavies who urinate on his threadbare carpet, an action that ignites the plot. As the Dude explains to the Big Lebowski when he visits the plutocrat\u2019s mansion to seek compensation, the rug \u201creally tied the room together\u201d.</p> <p>The interplay between the two vastly contrasting characters, the burly, rich, narrow-minded Big Lebowski and the laidback, anti-establishment softly spoken Dude, is among the major delights of the film. The Big Lebowski asks the Dude: \u201cWhat makes a man, Mr Lebowski?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, sir.\u201d \u201cIs it being prepared to do the right thing, whatever the cost?

Well, we didn\u2019t give up then, and by gum, we\u2019re not going to give up now!\u201d Huddleston later recalled of making the film: \u201cIt was probably the most fun I ever had on a set.\u201d</p> <p>He was born in Vinton, Virginia, son of Ismay, a teacher, and Lewis, an ironworker hit by the Depression.

I agree that the health of the media is at risk. Much of what I value was encapsulated by Malcolm X when he said that what African Americans needed was not training but education, and that the former was equivalent of teaching a dog a circus trick, while the latter taught people how to think.</p> <p>Thinking requires time. It is not consistent with a five-second attention span. If we have no ability to comprehend that truth ought to have priority over lies, then we are in deep trouble.</p> <p>If we fail to understand the difference between learning how to think for ourselves and obeying orders, between reading a considered piece of journalism and relying on the latest Facebook offering, will we be able to discern the difference between fact and fantasy?</p> <p>We do need expert and honest witnesses who speak truth to power without fear or favour. We also need thinking citizenry, not well-trained circus dogs. We need time to think. We need these things to be able to protect our democracies. We need them to be fully human.</p> <p>If we value democracy and the rights of citizens to have opinions and individual rights, and if we value the difference between fact and fiction, we must support our media so that it can continue to speak truth to power on our behalf, and do its best to keep us informed.<br><strong>Lavinia Moore</strong><br>Aldgate, South Australia</p> <h2><strong>Exploitation is the culprit</strong><br></h2> <p>No it is not globalisation that causes \u201cless affluent, less educated, mainly white people\u201d to feel themselves marginalised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/21/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-show-trial-republican-convention-built-on-anger\" title=\"\">(29 July)</a>. Poor whites feel marginalised because they are poor and marginalised, not by globalisation but by the exploitative economy that drives it at whatever human cost.</p> <p>The beggar-your-neighbour system that its friends and foes call capitalism enables those with wealth to buy up whatever human and other resources they can turn to profit, and drop them when they can\u2019t. Dead simple: buy cheap, sell dear, keep the difference and do the same again.</p> <p>Capitalism may be globalised but it\u2019s a very British disease. Fourteenth-century peasants revolted against serfdom, only to find themselves marginalised by sheep and enclosures. Luddites smashed the machines that made their manual skills redundant. Rebecca rioters in Wales attacked new toll gates rather than pay to use old rights of way.</p> <p>Scapegoating of foreigners and immigrants is nothing new either; it\u2019s sometimes prompted by those who might otherwise feel the heat themselves.</p> <p>High talk of globalisation helps fuel fears of immigration.

Use of the term project suggests a reasonable and achievable objective. The idea that a series of landmasses the size of New Zealand can be cleared of widespread populations of highly resilient species should be consigned to the realms of fantasy and myth. We New Zealanders indeed have a penchant for hobbits, trolls, <em>taniwha </em>(Maori mystical beings) and other such fantasies.</p> <p>However, the reality that a meaningful eradication attempt would take no less than martial law to override landowners\u2019 rights and poison every inch of the countryside, including sensitive areas such as organic farms and school grounds, despite huge safety concerns and organised opposition, puts the Pest Free NZ initiative firmly in the realms of fairytale.</p> <p>Considering the fact that the ecocidal poisons employed may kill some of the very species that they are being used to protect, we soon leave the realms of fantasy and have commenced a journey into horror. <br><strong>Tobi Muir</strong><br>Auckland, New Zealand</p> <p>\u2022 Will the New Zealand government\u2019s plans \u201cto exterminate all introduced predators\u201d include killing all the trout in its lakes and rivers?

Statues commemorating the endeavours of men and women whose contributions to the life and wellbeing of the community are by no means \u201ckitsch, idiotic and ineffective\u201d: rather they can be affectionate mementoes of men and women whose works, artistic, social or political, have benefited the local populace enormously, and deserve more than oblivion.</p> <p>I don\u2019t mean great granite monstrosities stuck on inscribed plinths getting covered daily in guano, such as Jones is probably referring to, but treated delicately, humanely and affectionately, they can bring fond memories to the populace, and be genuine works of art in their own right.</p> <p>We could take a leaf from the Hungarian style: Imre Nagy, the leader who led the tragically failed revolt against Soviet oppression, is seen, inconspicuously in everyday dress and his typical trilby, standing on a little humped bridge in Budapest. It can\u2019t fail to affect you emotionally. There are similar statues in many towns around Hungary.</p> <p>Think of the possibilities: Dylan Thomas in Swansea, TS Eliot at Margate, George Orwell at Wigan. You could go on and on.

  "<p>The most-ordered cocktail in the United States is the margarita. But during the run of the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which continues until 21 August, it may be supplanted by another south-of-the-border classic: the caipirinha.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to dig too deeply into Brazilian drinking habits before you bump into the caipirinha. It\u2019s the national cocktail and is made with Brazil\u2019s most common and popular indigenous spirit: cacha\u00e7a, a rum-like distillate. (Don\u2019t call it \u201cBrazilian rum\u201d unless you want to start an argument. The country lobbied hard to get to the American government to recognize the spirit as a distinct product native to Brazil.)</p> <p>The caipirinha isn\u2019t too far removed from its warm-weather drinking buddies, the margarita and daiquiri. All share the tropical trinity of sugar, lime juice and spirit. In the caipirinha\u2019s case, half of a lime, cut into wedges, is muddled with sugar at the bottom of a rocks glass and then topped with cacha\u00e7a and ice. It\u2019s a simple drink, even if it does require a little elbow grease to make.</p> <p>Americans first began to see the caipirinha pop up at bars in the 1990s, hot off the heels of the mojito craze, another equatorial drink that involves muddling \u2013 in the mojito\u2019s case, mint.</p> <p>\u201cA caipirinha is right on par with a mojito as a classic, refreshing, summertime drink,\u201d said mixologist Ivy Mix, an owner of the Brooklyn bar Leyenda, which specializes in drinks made with Latin spirits. </p> <p>The caipirinha remains the cocktail most closely associated with cacha\u00e7a . However, cacha\u00e7a\u2019s fortunes in the States have changed significantly since the dawn of the new century. </p> <p>\u201cBefore, most of the cacha\u00e7a exported from Brazil used to be industrial cacha\u00e7a,\u201d said Thiago Carmosina, co-founder of Yaguara Cacha\u00e7a, and a fifth-generation member of a cacha\u00e7a-producing family. \u201cIt was column-distilled. Lately, you have a bunch of artisanal brands who have begun to export abroad.\u201d</p> <p> Most white, unaged cacha\u00e7as are made with a column still, which produces a clean but less complex spirit. Recently, they have had to share space on American liquor store shelves with cacha\u00e7as made from an old fashioned pot still, which produce a more funky, flavorful spirit, and the aged versions of the spirit that are more commonly drunk in Brazil \u2013 often straight. According to Carmosina, cacha\u00e7a can be aged in barrels made from any of twenty kinds of wood, many of them native to the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1af1b0598adfd4706cdcbd8baace5a613988909d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1af1b0598adfd4706cdcbd8baace5a613988909d/0_199_3159_1895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bottles of Cacha\u00e7a at a shop in Rio, Brazil.

Mix, who carries four different versions of the Novo Fogo brand, thinks so: \u201cIt all tastes totally different.\u201d </p> <p>The Tanager expression, for instance, which is aged in both oak and arariba (Brazilian zebrawood) barrels, \u201ctastes like cinnamon nut crunch\u201d.</p> <p>Novo Fogo also sells single-barrel cacha\u00e7as, imitating the popular proprietary practice pioneered by the bourbon industry. Bars are able to sample and select a specific cask of liquid. Novo Fogo then bottles the barrel\u2019s contents and ships it to the bar, which sells it exclusively. </p> <p>In this brave new world of wide cacha\u00e7a choice, the tried and true caipirinha can been seen as both a boon and a burden. </p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a positive to start with,\u201d said Carmosina. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice way to open doors so they explore the cacha\u00e7a world. Then again, if they only know the caipirinha, they\u2019re only going to drink that. In the long term, it hurts us. In the short term, it helps us a lot.\u201d</p> <p>You can get a caipirinha at Leyenda, but don\u2019t expect to see it on the menu. \u201cWe don\u2019t really make that many caipirinhas,\u201d said Mix. \u201cI like to make cacha\u00e7a drinks that aren\u2019t so pigeonholed.\u201d</p> <h2>Caipirinha recipe </h2> <p><strong>\u00bd lime, cut into quarters</strong></p> <p><strong>Barspoon of sugar</strong></p> <p><strong>2 ounces unaged cacha\u00e7a</strong></p> <p>Place lime wedges and sugar in a heavy-bottomed rocks glass.

That\u2019s just as it should be, and in this latest piece they take the risk of trying to get us to contemplate the unimaginable: a world in which every human has vanished. <strong>LG</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/07/world-without-us-edinburgh-festival-review-ontroerend-goed\">Read the full three-star review</a></p> <h2>Once \u2026</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/once\">11.30am, Assembly George Square </a>(until 29 August)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"632ea10369c45036127340c0197b702ab195ad11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/632ea10369c45036127340c0197b702ab195ad11/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Once by Derevo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fairytale for adults \u2026 Once by Derevo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Love makes fools of everyone in this clowning show from the Russian company <a href=\"http://www.derevo.org/\">Derevo</a>, who swept the board with awards when it was seen in Edinburgh in 1998. Even Cupid gets it wrong in this fantastical tale: a ragged old man falls in love with a beautiful waitress in what is effectively a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlequinade\">Harlequin and Columbine</a> story. It\u2019s cute as hell, and often quite kitsch, but it would be a frozen heart that didn\u2019t respond to the sweet openness and pain of this fairytale for adults \u2013 or admire the skill with which it is executed. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>Fabric<br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/fabric\">11.55am, Underbelly Cowgate</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p>Nancy Sullivan is completely engaging and utterly heart-breaking as Leah who grew up dreaming of marriage and who thought she had found her prince in Ben. Abi Zakarian\u2019s script for this one-woman piece is beautifully observed and funny too. What initially seems to be a whip-smart contemporary version of an Alan Bennett Talking Head turns into something far darker as romance gives way to reality and Leah\u2019s life is stained in many different ways. Clever set and sound design, too, in a show that brings dirty little male secrets out into the light. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Josie Long and Martin Williams: Investigations</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/josie-long-and-martin-williams-investigations\">12pm, Stand Comedy Club</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p>Comedy on the fringe can take many forms: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/19/the-wrestling-at-edinburgh-festival-review-pleasance-grand-max-and-ivan\">wrestling</a>, therapy, <a href=\"http://www.chortle.co.uk/shows/edinburgh_fringe_2012/s/20066/simon_munnerys_la_concepta\">fine dining</a>. So why not investigative journalism? The well-loved DIY standup Josie Long teams up with Guardian writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-williams\">Williams</a> on a show that fuses comedy with politics, exposing truth, and muck-raking beneath and beyond the news headlines. Based on a version I saw in London last year, it will be informative, outspoken, amusing and unlike anything else. <strong>BL</strong></p> <h2>Binari</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/binari\">12pm, Assembly Hall</a> (until 29 August)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bfffa8134338662ab4aafc7536d82f8a2c6158f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bfffa8134338662ab4aafc7536d82f8a2c6158f/127_1011_7161_4295/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Binari\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unexpected charmer \u2026 Binari</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When a traditional dance form is uprooted from its local culture it runs the risk of losing its integrity or its life. But Binari, an unexpected charmer of a show that\u2019s based on the songs and dances of Korean funeral rites, makes the journey to the western stage with real grace. On paper it sounds forbiddingly austere, its narrative essentially the rite of passage by which the soul of a dead woman is released into the afterlife. Yet Binari is choreographed with such a satisfying fusion of dance, music and imagery that the work feels anything but remote. <strong>JM</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/18/binari-at-edinburgh-festival-review-assembly-hall-korean-funeral-rites\">Read the full three-star review</a></p> <h2>AFTERNOON</h2> <h2>Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons<br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/lemons-lemons-lemons-lemons-lemons\">12.10pm, Roundabout @ Summerhall</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/15/lemons-lemons-lemons-lemons-lemons-review-edinburgh-festival-southside-walrus-theatre\">Last year</a>, playwright Sam Steiner\u2019s debut show was in the hottest room on the fringe, but it (and the audience) will have room to breathe now that it is staged in Paines Plough\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.roundaboutpp.com/\">Roundabout</a> tent. This smartly conceived, pared-back love story imagines a world in which everyone is only allowed an allocation of 140 words a day.

It weaves stories of space exploration with accounts of those who risk their lives on leaky boats to make the perilous journey between Africa and Europe. Last Dream (on Earth) may feature live music but it\u2019s not a piece with bells and whistles \u2013 rather, it takes audiences on a quietly rewarding journey of their own. <strong>LG</strong><br></p> <h2>Austentatious<br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/austentatious-an-improvised-jane-austen-novel\">1.30pm, Underbelly, George Square</a> (until 21 August)</p> <p>When I reviewed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/aug/14/austentatious-edinburgh-festival-review\">Austentatious: An Improvised Jane Austen Novel</a> a few years back, I was happy to help spread the word about a very funny long-form improv show making hay with the conventions of Regency-era period drama. I didn\u2019t know then that Austentatious would also become a production line for eminent solo comics: in the years since, musical act <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/aug/16/rachel-parris-edinburgh-2013-review\">Rachel Parris</a> and multimedia innovator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/13/desert-island-discs-kirsty-young-joseph-morpurgo-soothing-sounds-for-baby-invisible-dot\">Joseph Morpurgo</a> have joined co-star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/07/cariad-lloyd-comedy-standup-solo-shows-edinburgh\">Cariad Lloyd</a> as acclaimed performers in their own right.

So it proves for the unhappily named Valentine, son of a Polish taxidermist, and Ashley, daughter of Mr Tutti-Frutti, a debt-ridden ice-cream salesman in a town where it\u2019s too cold to eat ice-cream. Alan Harris spins a piece of very funny popular theatre about the need for dreams, seizing the initiative when all seems lost and bringing people together. <strong>LG<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/08/love-lies-and-taxidermy-edinburgh-festival-review-stupidly-lovely-romcom-wins-against-the-odds\">Read the full four-star review</a></p> <h2>Letters to Windsor House</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/letters-to-windsor-house\">1.35pm, Summerhall</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p>London\u2019s housing crisis and its effects upon relationships is explored with beady-eyed sharpness and a large dollop of humour in the latest from Sh!t Theatre. It\u2019s deceptively rackety stuff, but it gets to the heart of a situation in which the social cleansing of London\u2019s poor is taking place almost without comment, and people\u2019s lives are becoming dominated by the need to find somewhere affordable to live. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>Goggles</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/goggles\">2pm, Pleasance Courtyard</a> (until 29 August)</p> <p>Edinburgh is full of young companies making fluffy, whimsical theatre, and at first sight This Egg\u2019s two-hander about love, friendship and breaking free seems to be just one more. But there are hidden depths in a hugely enjoyable story in which the performers also play two goldfish, and where the metaphor for escaping the fish bowl of a suffocating relationship is handled with humour and a lightness of touch. Lots of fun. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>One Hundred Homes</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/one-hundred-homes\">2.05pm, Summerhall</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p>You go into a shed in the Summerhall courtyard and are offered tea and biscuits. Then Yinka Kuitenbrouwer delves into her archive, and tells you about her encounters with some of the 100-plus people she has visited in the places where they live, and asked what home means to them. It\u2019s as simple as that. But it\u2019s quietly heartwarming and thoughtful too, as it makes unexpected connections, raises questions about expectation and privilege, knocks back assumptions and probes whether home is a place or a state of mind. Just lovely. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>Giants</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/giants\">3.15pm, Pleasance Courtyard</a> (until 28 August)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abb29e67b2e87972ffb3ff82cc2e554eebfc7f91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abb29e67b2e87972ffb3ff82cc2e554eebfc7f91/0_4324_4912_2947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Engaging \u2026 Giants\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Engaging \u2026 Giants</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born two days apart, apparently, and \u2013 if their show is to be believed \u2013 boon companions in infancy, Barney Fishwick and Will Hislop (son of Ian) now debut in Edinburgh with their double-act Giants. Former Oxford Revue presidents, there\u2019s a sense here of a duo still working out their USP, in a show that brings nothing blazingly new or distinctive to the sketch world. But they\u2019re engaging and watchable hosts, whose charm offsets the weaker sketches, and who have enough strong alternatives (including the one where Fishwick amusingly misplaces his cup of coffee) to make this maiden set worth a visit. <strong>BL</strong></p> <h2><strong>Smother</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/smother\">3.20, Zoo Southside</a> (until 27 August)</p> <p>Hip-hop has progressed a long way beyond its old macho image, but still it\u2019s a surprise to encounter a dance work like Smother, which places a story of gay love and gay relationships at its heart \u2026 While Smother has the dramatic texture of a play, it is unequivocally a dance piece: and with performers of terrific strength and personality, it takes hip-hop into thrillingly new terrain. <strong>JM</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/18/smother-edinburgh-festival-review-street-dance-gay-romance\">Read the full four-star review</a></p> <h2>Lucy, Lucy and Lucy Barfield<br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/lucy-lucy-and-lucy-barfield\">3.30pm, Pleasance Courtyard</a> (until 29 August)</p> <p>I love the fringe because it throws up small, thoughtful, moving and unassuming shows such as this one in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/01/lion-witch-lucy-lucy-and-lucy-barfield-edinburgh-festival-cs-lewis\">Lucy Grace sets out in search of Lucy Barfield</a>, the girl to whom CS Lewis dedicated The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. A piece about growing up and discovering that you are locked out of Narnia forever \u2013 and about trying to make a future when the magic is lost \u2013 it may not be very sophisticated but it has an unaffected grace (in more ways than one) as it unravels the mystery. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>Bilal Zafar: Cakes<br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/bilal-zafar-cakes\">3.40pm, Just the Tonic at the Mash House</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p>Bilal Zafar won the prestigious <a href=\"http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2016/01/31/24073/bilal_zafar_is_top_of_the_bill\">New Act of the Year award</a> earlier this year, after which you might expect he\u2019d hit Edinburgh eager to show off his acclaimed standup chops. Instead, he makes his debut with a gentle PowerPoint show, telling the story \u2013 illustrated by screengrabs from Twitter \u2013 of how a fake identity he adopted online attracted the ire of the far right. The show\u2019s charms arrive in a fairly low key: the Islamophobic e-kerfuffle he kicks up is a minor one, and there are no great surprises in the revelation that Twitter is permanently manned by idiots. But Zafar\u2019s wry circumspection is well-judged, and the material cribbed from his online persecutors duly delivers some big laughs. <strong>BL</strong></p> <h2>The Interference</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/interference\">3.45pm, C Chambers</a> (until 16 August)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"494b98d7d7ef5d504616845470559e433029d250\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/494b98d7d7ef5d504616845470559e433029d250/0_193_1407_844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gripping \u2026 The Interference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gripping \u2026 The Interference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brittney Rivera</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In American football, an interference is when one player obstructs another using his body.

Will the police take her seriously? How will the university deal with the matter? Everyone has got an opinion on the internet, and soon Karen finds that it\u2019s Smith who is being cast as the victim. There\u2019s a questing intelligence to a gripping drama that doesn\u2019t shirk the complexities of the case and cleverly uses a fragmented style to reflect the noisiness of a connected media and online world where all the chatter interferes with justice. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>Ada/Ava</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/ada-ava-by-manual-cinema\">4pm, Underbelly Potterrow</a> (until 29 August)</p> <p>If you love the work of Paper Cinema you will also fall for this macabre little charmer by the Chicago company <a href=\"http://manualcinema.com/\">Manual Cinema</a>, who hand-craft a movie in front of your eyes using puppetry, live music and action. It\u2019s got a real black-and-white, silent-film retro appeal as it tells the story of an elderly woman learning to cope alone when her identical twin unexpectedly dies. Full of loving detail, skill and ingenuity, the show takes grief very seriously as it plays with mirror images to clever effect. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>Radio Active</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/radio-active\">4.20pm, Pleasance Courtyard</a><strong> </strong>(until 28 August)</p> <p>Inspired by the staging of old <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-32189443\">Hancock\u2019s Half Hour</a> scripts on the Fringe last year, Angus Deayton is now doing the same with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00c7zvk/episodes/guide\">Radio Active</a>, his commercial-broadcasting spoof, co-written with the late Geoffrey Perkins, that ran for seven years in the 1980s on Radio 4.

Bea Roberts, who wrote the terrific <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/08/and-then-come-the-nightjars-review-touching-tale-of-love-and-loss-on-the-farm\">And Then Come the Nightjars</a>, reimagines Madame Bovary for the 21st century without actors but with considerable help from two screens, a TV monitor, an overhead projector and a sound deck. Our heroine is no French provincial housewife but an admin assistant in a Plymouth plumbers with a ruinous Asos habit and a marriage long gone stale. Imagine Bridget Jones meets The Office meets 19th-century realist fiction. Even with technical difficulties at the performance I saw, this original show proved painfully funny and oddly moving. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>Katy Brand: I Was a Teenage Christian</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/katy-brand-i-was-a-teenage-christian\">4.45pm, Pleasance Courtyard</a> (until 29 August)</p> <p>Katy Brand has a fine story to tell of her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/04/katy-brand-teenage-christian-comedy-interview\">youthful obsession with revivalist Christianity</a>. In the telling, it lacks dramatic shape or climax. But what it loses in artfulness, it gains in honesty: Brand feels the cringe and does it anyway, parading her teenage egotism and delusion to diverting, if not uproarious, comic effect. It\u2019s an entertaining account of a teenager\u2019s search for herself and of the impulses that drive some of us into religion\u2019s comforting embrace. <strong>BL</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/07/katy-brand-at-edinburgh-festival-review-teenage-christian\">Read the full three-star review</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2016/jun/08/edinburgh-festival-2016-what-to-see-and-where-to-go\">Edinburgh festival 2016: what to see and where to go</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>How (Not) to Live in Suburbia</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/how-not-to-live-in-suburbia\">4.50pm, Summerhall</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p>Annie Siddons turns personal disaster into art with witty, engaging satire that sends up both herself and the inhabitants of Twickenham as she succumbs to fiscal failure and professional paralysis in the leafy suburbs. Of course it\u2019s not really about suburbia but about a corrosive, creeping loneliness and depression. It\u2019s dark, but it\u2019s also playful and inventive with a lovely Jane Austen-style leave-taking spoof and a brilliant scene in which she is evicted from the book club for making everyone else feel stupid. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>Dancer</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/dancer\">5pm, Dance Base</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p>An exquisite two-hander created by Gary Gardiner and Ian Johnston with the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/24/adrian-howells\">Adrian Howells</a>. Howells\u2019 mantra that \u201cit\u2019s all allowed\u201d underpins a simple but moving piece in which the learning disabled Johnston tells us about who is and isn\u2019t allowed to dance, and in the process offers up his sharpest moves. It celebrates the sheer joy of losing yourself on the dance floor and challenges preconceptions and expectations. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>Barrowland Ballet: Whiteout</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/whiteout\">5pm, Zoo Southside</a> (until 27 August)</p> <p>Natasha Gilmore has a warm, witty and poetic eye for the nuances of ordinary life. In her previous fringe hit, Carmel, she assembled a vividly assorted cast (ranging from an 18-month-old baby to an 82-year-old dancer) to explore the dynamics of family life. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/may/01/whiteout-barrowlands-ballet-review\">Whiteout</a> she uses her own marriage to a West African as the springboard to probe the possibilities and the problems of falling in love in a multi-racial society. Set to a soundtrack by Luke Sutherland, Gilmore\u2019s work promises a rich choreographic mix, layered with her acute observation of everyday human behaviour. <strong>Judith Mackrell</strong></p> <h2>Daphne\u2019s Second Show</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/daphne-s-second-show\">5.45pm, Pleasance Courtyard</a> (until 28 August)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcb0b5dc26b8241aa09c037d91c2489f9b105fee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcb0b5dc26b8241aa09c037d91c2489f9b105fee/0_2336_4912_3905/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uneven charm \u2026 Daphne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"795\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uneven charm \u2026 Daphne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Crockett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They were the buzziest new sketch troupe in the run-up to last year\u2019s fringe, and Daphne (Phil Wang, George Fouracres and Jason Forbes) duly delivered with their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/09/daphne-edinburgh-festival-review-pleasance-phil-wang-jason-forbes-george-fouracres\">seductively off-beam debut</a>.

And yet, here was a trio that didn\u2019t quite work like other sketch troupes. Their unevenness was part of their considerable charm.

She\u2019s a whirlwind of comic energy, with a confidence and ability you seldom see in rookie standups. In her first fringe outing, ostensibly themed around her own funeral, she doesn\u2019t quite sustain that steamroller force: she\u2019s out of breath for much of its second half. But this is still a stellar debut: silly, charismatic, and packed with great gags about mortality, clothes shopping and the Jamaican dancehall king Sean Paul. <strong>BL </strong></p> <h2><strong>EVENING</strong></h2> <h2>Kiri Pritchard-McLean: Hysterical Woman</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/kiri-pritchard-mclean-hysterical-woman\">6pm, Pleasance Courtyard</a> (until 29 August)</p> <p>In this bold solo debut, Kiri Pritchard-McLean \u2013 director of sketch troupe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/09/edinburgh-festival-2014-review-geins-family-giftshop\">Gein\u2019s Family Giftshop</a> \u2013 explains how women seldom get to appear alongside other women in comedy clubs, and how all-female bills get called \u201cParalympic nights\u201d.

Reece brings a bit of it with him to Edinburgh, recreating his parents\u2019 front room in the Pleasance Bunker.

This year, one third of that trio, Joe Barnes, doubles up with Henry Perryment in another excellent \u2013 if not quite so eye-catching \u2013 sketch hour. The conceit finds Barnes and Parryment presenting \u201ca selection of characters and occurrences from around the world on a single day in 2016\u201d.

(It helped, of course, that award-winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/aug/25/comedy.edinburgh2006\">The Naked Racist</a> was a great show too.) A decade on, Nichol\u2019s still coming, and this year celebrates 20 years\u2019 of solo comedy shows on the fringe.

Even if his shows didn\u2019t sell out in minutes, that\u2019d be a hot ticket. In this new solo play, Kitson portrays William, a lonely writer cooped up in his \u201cwarehouse\u201d office, 12 years into creating a story about a woman and a communicative rodent. Kitson interrupts the action to narrate, in flashback, the events that led William to this point.

Whether they\u2019re playing self-peeling potatoes, movement-theatre maestros or a chanteuse constructed from all three of their bodies, Laura Trenerry, Lucy Fox and Ell Sachs pitch everything they do right at the audience.

Racism can\u2019t be fixed until white people acknowledge their identity and its advantages, he contends \u2013 offering his mainly pale-skinned audience a head start with routines about gentrification, cultural appropriation and, er, bestiality.

Car manufacturer Nissan, which employs 6,700 people in Sunderland (where 60% voted leave), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/05/nissan-warns-sunderland-uk-car-plant-hinges-brexit-talks\">said any future investment decisions</a> \u201cwill depend on the outcome of Brexit negotiations\u201d. <br></p> <p>And merchant bank Goldman Sachs, which has 6,000 staff in Britain, joined a string of international banks who have said they may pull some of their EU business out of London once Britain leaves, announcing that Brexit may force it to restructure some of its UK activities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7b5819ffdce3148a3cff56ca82826a819f38cd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7b5819ffdce3148a3cff56ca82826a819f38cd4/0_267_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A worker at the Nissan car plant in Sunderland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A worker at the Nissan car plant in Sunderland.

Switzerland voted narrowly in a 2014 referendum to cap EU immigration and is now faced with a constitutional obligation to apply the vote. </p> <p>The problem, as both <a href=\"https://infacts.org/swiss-send-message-alps-pennines/\">InFacts</a> and <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/swiss-could-become-brexits-latest-casualty-european-union-migration/\">Politico</a> observed last week, is that curbing immigration would violate the EU\u2019s fundamental principle linking free movement to single market access, jeopardising a raft of vital bilateral deals between the Swiss and the union \u2013 their largest trading partner. Sound familiar? </p> <p>So far, Brussels has made it clear to Bern that free movement is strictly non-negotiable, and Switzerland \u2013 caught between the rock of its referendum result and the hard place of EU principles \u2013 has admitted Brexit makes things tricky. It may well be that a second referendum is the only way out: watch this space.</p> <h2>Meanwhile, back in Westminster</h2> <p>With parliament on its hols there is little of consequence in SW1, but the row over David Cameron\u2019s resignation honours list rumbles on.

In the UK, it\u2019s echoed by a rabidly right-wing press, and unchallenged by a flaccid establishment media.

She and Batman then have sex in the wake of their stormy argument, something that never happened in the comics and which completely undermines Batgirl as a potent force in her own right. </p> <p>While this double dose of misogyny may just be the result of poor timing, these are the kind of errors we cannot imagine happening at DC\u2019s rival Marvel, whose worst mistakes regarding its treatment of women <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/17/marvel-axed-female-villain-from-iron-man-3-after-fears-of-poor-toy-sales-says-director\">seem to revolve around poor merchandise judgments</a>. </p> <p>There\u2019s a strong possibility, if the DCEU can survive Suicide Squad\u2019s critical bashing, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/17/margot-robbie-harley-quinn-suicide-squad-dc-marvel-comic-book-films\">Harley and Batgirl might even find themselves appearing together in an upcoming spin-off</a> featuring many of the key female stars of the Bat-verse, from Birds of Prey to Poison Ivy, Katana and Bumblebee. According to reports, the new film \u2013 Robbie herself has pitched the concept to Warner Bros \u2013 is being considered due to the popularity of the DC Super Hero Girls line of comics and related products, which have been successfully aimed at a burgeoning female readership. </p> <p>But if DC and its studio partners really want to start making movies that empower women, they\u2019re going a very funny way about it.</p>",
  "<p>This weekend saw good and bad news for Warner Bros, a studio desperately in need of the former.

The dreaded cinematic universe</h2> <p>Ever since the Avengers assembled across multiple movies, every other studio has been eagerly brainstorming ways to turn a linear franchise into a criss-crossing \u201ccinematic universe\u201d. Those two words have been attached to everything from the Fast &amp; Furious series to Hasbro\u2019s films. This year has seen Warners\u2019 DC masterplan start to collapse, with their attempt to replicate Marvel\u2019s impressive handiwork feeling laboured. While Captain America, Iron Man and their cohorts zipped around effortlessly from film to film, Batman and Superman have sluggishly stomped between efforts, grimly smashing everything in their sights.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/20/dc-comics-cinematic-universe-struggles\">What can DC do to save its struggling comic book cinematic universe?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not exactly breaking news that studios are eager for cash, but cinematic universes have made them blind, deaf and dumb with greed. The sharp drop-offs for both Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad show that anticipation and brand awareness will only get you so far, and that audiences, savvy enough to understand what\u2019s being constructed beyond the framework of the film they\u2019re watching, need something more to maintain their interest. Everything now hinges on next year for Warners, with Wonder Woman and Justice League testing both the loyalty of their fanbase and the studio\u2019s ability to learn from their mistakes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88a2f4698779562717c66e2dc0201b24bc65b785\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88a2f4698779562717c66e2dc0201b24bc65b785/0_0_4919_2952/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the many China-based scenes in Now You See Me 2.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the many China-based scenes in Now You See Me 2.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2. Eastern promises</h2> <p>The growing importance of the Chinese market, and studios\u2019 pandering to overseas audiences to ensure added profits, have never been more noticeable than during this year\u2019s set of blockbusters. Independence Day: Resurgence crowbarred in two Chinese characters, lines of dialogue in Chinese and prominent placement of the Chinese drink Moon Milk, while around one-third of Now You See Me 2 was set in Macau.</p> <p>Now, adding some internationality to the often dull uniformity of American blockbusters is no bad thing, but these decisions aren\u2019t led by creative impulses. A blockbuster that feels like a commercial product is hardly a unicorn, but the Chinese influence is making movies feel more mechanical than ever before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8951d5ac149c936f7f92a8eee6a22ba86c82f9c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8951d5ac149c936f7f92a8eee6a22ba86c82f9c8/0_60_3444_2068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paula Patton in Warcraft: The Beginning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paula Patton in Warcraft: The Beginning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3. Franchise non-starters</h2> <p>The only thing a studio wants more than a successful sequel is a film so successful that it will need a sequel of its own. This summer, Universal, coming off a record year, hoped that its ambitiously titled video-game adaptation Warcraft: The Beginning would launch a new set of related films, but the $160m adventure was a washout in the US, making less than $50m. It might have clawed back some cash in China, but local interest has been so poor that a sequel is unlikely.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/29/the-legend-of-tarzan-flaws-africa-colonialism\">King of the bungle: why Tarzan will never be OK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Warners was also hoping that an umpteenth Tarzan film would lead to further adventures, but current box office suggests otherwise. A $335m global total is no disaster but with a $180m budget attached, making more jungle-set capers would be a risky decision. The Nice Guys was also given one of the most blatantly open endings of the season but, despite strong reviews, it failed to catch on with audiences so more instalments seem unlikely. The original films that have secured sequels this season are The Secret Life of Pets and Lights Out, showing that animation and horror are still the most reliable genres in the business.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7670092a5ab9ce81c24be7e4a1ce2502fa41d25c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7670092a5ab9ce81c24be7e4a1ce2502fa41d25c/591_0_3271_1963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied by LMK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4. Franchise fatigue</h2> <p>While audiences and critics were happy to see a sequel to Finding Nemo (Finding Dory has become the biggest animated film of all time in the US), they\u2019ve been less impressed with most other sequels offered up this summer. Globally, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows made less than half of the original\u2019s surprise $493m take; Alice Through the Looking Glass made less than a third of Alice in Wonderland\u2019s $1bn total; and The Huntsman: Winter\u2019s War made just $164m in comparison to the $396m that Snow White brought in.</p> <p>The first Alice and Snow White films worked because of the awareness that their title characters brought with them, but audiences were less familiar with anything that came after (the Huntsman plot was an entirely new invention), while a Ninja Turtles sequel was hardly at the top of anyone\u2019s wish-list. Even no-brainers under-performed, such as X-Men: Apocalypse ($534m to Future Past\u2019s $747m) and Ice Age: Collision Course ($288m to Continental Drift\u2019s $877m), suggesting a general franchise boredom. But all of these films had one other thing in common ...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"605893726e333075b06b505cd0881b4e20b801dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/605893726e333075b06b505cd0881b4e20b801dc/371_155_1660_997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Lawrence in X-Men: Apocalypse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennifer Lawrence in X-Men: Apocalypse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20TH CENTURY FOX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5. Bad reviews</h2> <p>It\u2019s the most obvious point to be making but one of the major problems this season is that Hollywood just isn\u2019t making good films. The battle to lure audiences away from Netflix was temporarily won last year thanks to event movies that were loved by fans and critics (Star Wars: The Force Awakens; Jurassic World; Inside Out; The Martian) but this year\u2019s crop has seen a major dip in quality. Angry DC fans tried to shut down Rotten Tomatoes last week after the negative Suicide Squad reviews, but the film\u2019s sharp drop-off shows the reviews were representative of the film\u2019s general lousiness.</p> <p>With audiences tweeting their reactions, good word of mouth is even more important, which explains why the films that have succeeded this summer have been the ones that have benefited from critical support. The season\u2019s biggest hit, Finding Dory, has a 94% Rotten Tomatoes rating, Captain America: Civil War boasts 90%, while surprise smash The Secret Life of Pets is up to 75%. That two of these three hits are animated, along with Zootropolis\u2019 huge $1bn take in March (a film which had a 98% rating), also indicate that children remain the most reliable demographic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d96c98969bbaa66e9f2ba37da2ea0cd70e0d4f01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d96c98969bbaa66e9f2ba37da2ea0cd70e0d4f01/0_1191_7854_4715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zootopia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zootopia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Disney</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The success of Zootropolis, along with pre-summer 2016 hits The Jungle Book, The Revenant and Deadpool, also shows that seasons have shifted at the box office. The summer months and the Christmas period are no longer the only times when studios unleash their major releases. Audiences are no longer saving up until June but are splashing out on Imax and 3D surcharges all year round. </p> <p>This summer might have been a disappointment, but this spring definitely wasn\u2019t, and this autumn and winter, bringing along new Star Wars and Harry Potter spin-offs, is unlikely to be either ...</p>",
  "<p>Why would a writer seek to be homeless? For George Orwell, it was \u201ca feeling of relief, almost of pleasure, at knowing yourself at last genuinely down and out. You have talked so often of going to the dogs \u2013 and well, here are the dogs, and you have reached them, and you can stand it. It takes off a lot of anxiety.\u201d Authors and poets have long traded the comforts of home for the hardships of the road and produced great work as a result. Among them are some of literature\u2019s more complicated and daring figures: the likes of Orwell, Thomas De Quincey, Jack London and John Clare.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"72ab0f91ace4676b7f6dcebab1804c237407c2ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72ab0f91ace4676b7f6dcebab1804c237407c2ea/26_0_2716_3394/800.jpg\" alt=\"English \u2018nature\u2019 poet John Clare (1793-1864), who spent much of his life destitute, and died in Northampton General Asylum.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">English \u2018nature\u2019 poet John Clare (1793-1864), who spent much of his life destitute, and died in Northampton General Asylum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edward Gooch/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.clarecottage.org/\">Clare is remembered as the Northampton \u201cpeasant poet\u201d</a>, a prolific walker who wrote more than 3,500 poems over the course of a tumultuous life. Born in Helpston in 1793 and raised on the land, he was deeply frustrated by the enclosures of common land gathering momentum during his time, which disrupted his freedom to roam the countryside that defined his youth and informed much of his work. By 1841, the poet had spent five years at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/02/the-quickening-maze\">Dr Matthew Allen\u2019s private asylum</a> in Epping Forest. On 20 July, he walked out of the trees and tramped home to Northborough \u2013 more than 80 miles in four days \u2013 looking for his deceased childhood sweetheart, Mary Joyce.</p> <p>Immediately after his gruelling expedition, Clare wrote the extraordinary <a href=\"https://dawnpiper.wordpress.com/john-clares-walk-1841/\">Recollections of Journey from Essex</a>, a fevered prose account of the trek, which, he explains, involved sleeping on the stone floor of a porch and eating handfuls of grass \u2013 which tasted \u201csomething like bread\u201d \u2013 from the roadside. His biographer Jonathan Bate has said the piece \u201cbrings us closer than anything else to his immediate experience\u201d, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/oct/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview3\">Iain Sinclair rehearsed the terrible journey</a> for his 2005 book Edge of the Orison \u2013 and more recently for his friend and collaborator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/01/by-our-selves-review-john-clare-andrew-kotting-toby-jones\">Andrew K\u00f6tting\u2019s haunting documentary By Our Selves</a>. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Clare\u2019s experience of poverty was, for the most part, authentic. Unlike, for example, William Wordsworth, who \u2013 as Matthew Beaumont explains in his excellent book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/20/nightwalking-matthew-beaumont-review-london-after-dark-chaucer-dickens\">Nightwalking: A Nocturnal History of London</a> \u2013 observed vagrancy with detached fascination and sympathy along the country road, Clare was born into hardship.</p> <p>Thomas De Quincey, however, falls somewhere in between the vagrant and the observer. In his celebrated essay Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, he describes a \u201cmost painful affection of the stomach\u201d, which he attributes to the extreme bouts of hunger he experienced as a youth traversing north Wales. He goes on to relay the additional agony of his largely self-inflicted indigence in London, which he spent roaming the streets with a \u201cnoble minded\u201d prostitute called Ann; and later his opium-fuelled Saturday nights, walking \u201cwithout much regarding the direction or the distance, to all the markets, and other parts of London, to which the poor resort\u201d. But De Quincey\u2019s attitudes towards the poor were complex; reportedly a lifelong conservative, his depictions were sometimes compassionate, occasionally contemptuous, and more generally inconsistent \u2013 surprising, considering his own often precarious circumstances.</p> <p>At the turn of the 20th century, American novelist Jack London, as a kind of precursor to Orwell, came to the English capital and immersed himself in the degradations of the East End, from which experience he penned his unflinching portrayal of <a href=\"http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/PeopleOfTheAbyss/preface.html\">The People of the Abyss</a>. He describes, in passionate journalistic prose, the dire conditions in which the poor clung to life, kipping in \u201cthe spike\u201d (the workhouse), sipping \u201cskilly\u201d (a foul concoction comprised of \u201cthree quarts of oatmeal stirred into three-buckets-and-a-half of hot water\u201d) and dining on rank hospital leftovers. He also reflects on the absurd role of the police, who would forcibly prevent the homeless from sleeping at night, and goes some way to anatomising an appalling system: \u201cHere then we have the construction of the Abyss. Throughout the whole industrial fabric a constant elimination is going on. The inefficient are weeded out and flung downward.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f9cf0fb894f28910070c5799359dafbccb41422\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f9cf0fb894f28910070c5799359dafbccb41422/0_0_1667_2082/801.jpg\" alt=\"George Orwell, writer, 1940s Photo By CSU Archv/Everett / Rex Features\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Orwell: \u2018The stars are a free show; it don\u2019t cost anything to use your eyes.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CSU Archv/Everett / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then in 1933, Victor Gollancz brought to print George Orwell\u2019s Down and Out in Paris and London, perhaps the most famous text of its kind. This is a very well known story, but there is also his Hop-Picking Diary, an account of a journey to Kent. Here, as in London, he spent time with itinerant companions working the fields, earning just enough to scrape by. It\u2019s a frank account that begins with the writer meaning to sleep at St Martin\u2019s church and ends with a glossary of new words picked up along the way: \u201cscrump\u201d (to steal), \u201ctoby\u201d (on the tramp), \u201cdidecai\u201d (a gypsy) and \u201csprowsie\u201d (sixpence).</p> <p>Since Orwell\u2019s seminal work with the poor and destitute, many more writers have sought out similar experiences. Take <a href=\"http://londonist.com/2013/06/an-insight-into-having-no-fixed-abode-in-london\">Charlie Carroll\u2019s 2013 book No Fixed Abode</a> as a fine example. The out-of-work teacher decided \u2013 with no small nod to his predecessors \u2013 to up and leave his home in Cornwall and tramp all the way to London, meeting an array of singular characters on the road. Recently in print for the first time, blogger Craig Stone\u2019s bizarrely titled debut, <a href=\"http://guyportman.com/reviews/the-squirrel-that-dreamt-of-madness/\">The Squirrel That Dreamt of Madness</a>, was written while he lived in a north London park. He\u2019d quit his job in the City and, unable to pay the rent on his flat, was determined to make something worthwhile of his newfound dereliction.</p> <p>So what is the attraction of being down and out? For some, the prospect of real, hard-hitting subject matter has proved irresistible, while for others the route to the streets has been paved with anguish. Historically, those who have deliberately flung themselves downwards, as London might have put it, have tended to come from middle-class backgrounds and been almost exclusively male \u2013 a privileged position from which to explore the abyss, before rising again into comfort and security. For me, writers who have felt compelled to draw attention to the poor\u2019s lot have produced the best work. Many more will no doubt follow suit; there\u2019s something essential, vital, about understanding a little of what it is to be without a roof. </p>",

So it\u2019s important to have a full discussion, see where we are, and look at possibilities for further cooperation.\u201d</p> <p>Ushakov said the fact that Erdo\u011fan was making the effort to travel to St Petersburg despite the current internal situation in Turkey was evidence that the Turkish side was serious about a resumption of good relations between the countries.</p> <p>However, it is unlikely they will immediately return to their previous level, given the amount of angry rhetoric exchanged in recent months. Ushakov said the issue of compensation over the plane would be raised. Erdo\u011fan is also likely to ask Putin to temper Russian support for Kurds in Syria.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>There were already signs of the thaw on Monday, as Turkish authorities unblocked the website of the Sputnik news agency, a Kremlin-funded news service.

  "<p>Susan Collins announced she would not vote for Donald Trump on Monday, joining the few other Republican senators to repudiate the party\u2019s nominee for president.</p> <p>\u201cI will not be voting for Donald Trump for president,\u201d the senator from Maine wrote <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/gop-senator-why-i-cannot-support-trump/2016/08/08/821095be-5d7e-11e6-9d2f-b1a3564181a1_story.html\">in an op-ed published in the Washington Post</a> on Monday night. \u201cThis is not a decision I make lightly, for I am a lifelong Republican. But Donald Trump does not reflect historical Republican values nor the inclusive approach to governing that is critical to healing the divisions in our country.\u201d<br></p> <p>Senators Lindsey Graham, Mark Kirk, Ben Sasse, Dean Heller and Jeff Flake have all said they would either not vote for Trump or adamantly voiced their resistance to the notion. Senator Ted Cruz, who was defeated by Trump in the primary race, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/ted-cruz-speech-republican-national-convention-trump-endorsement\">urged conservatives to \u201cvote your conscience\u201d at the Republican national convention</a>.</p> <p>Two Republican representatives, Virginia\u2019s Scott Rigell and New York\u2019s Richard Hanna, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/06/republican-votes-libertarian-donald-trump-gary-johnson\">publicly rejected Trump</a> in the past week. On Saturday, Rigell told the New York Times he would vote for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, and earlier last week Hanna said he would vote for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Both Rigell and Hanna have said they intend to retire after this term, and Collins does not face re-election this fall. She has consistently criticized Trump\u2019s racially charged and offensive comments throughout the primary and had refused to say whether she would vote for Trump.</p> <p>Other Republican senators put in difficult positions by Trump include John McCain, running for re-election in an increasingly Hispanic Arizona, and Kelly Ayotte, running for re-election in moderate New Hampshire. Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-endorses-paul-ryan-wisconsin-rally\">awkwardly endorsed both senators</a> last week after initially refusing to do so.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s \u201cconstant stream of cruel comments\u201d disturbed Collins throughout the primary and through the Republican convention, she wrote, \u201cbut it was his attacks directed at people who could not respond on an equal footing \u2013 either because they do not share his power or stature or because professional responsibility precluded them from engaging at such a level \u2013 that revealed Mr Trump as unworthy of being our president\u201d.</p> <p>In particular, Collins cited Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/26/donald-trump-mock-new-york-times-reporter-disability\">mockery of a disabled reporter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/19/donald-trump-john-mccain-vietnam-prisoner-of-war\">of Senator McCain\u2019s war service</a> last year, his insistence that a federal judge from Indiana <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/05/donald-trump-muslim-judges-face-the-nation\">had racial bias because his parents were from Mexico</a>, and finally his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-muslim-father-khizr-khan-democratic-convention-speech\">criticism of two gold star parents</a>, Khizr and Ghazala Khan, whose son Humayun was a US army captain killed in Iraq protecting other soldiers.</p> <p>\u201cRather than honoring their sacrifice and recognizing their pain, Mr Trump disparaged the religion of the family of an American hero,\u201d Collins wrote. \u201cAnd once again, he proved incapable of apologizing, of saying he was wrong.\u201d</p> <p>The senator also described Trump as a threat to world security, saying his \u201clack of self-restraint and his barrage of ill-informed comments would make an already perilous world even more so. It is reckless for a presidential candidate to publicly raise doubts about honoring treaty commitments with our allies.\u201d</p> <p>Collins also responded to assurances from Trump\u2019s campaign and some Republican leaders that Trump would soften his tone in the general election, and cease criticizing party members and minorities. \u201cThere will be no \u2018new\u2019 Donald Trump,\u201d she wrote, \u201cjust the same candidate who will slash and burn and trample anything and anyone he perceives as being in his way or an easy scapegoat.\u201d</p> <p>Maine\u2019s Republican governor, Paul LePage, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/may/14/who-supports-donald-trump-the-new-republican-center-of-gravity\">endorsed Trump</a>, and the candidate himself <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft9oujWos64\">held a rally in Portland</a>, Maine, last week, despite the state\u2019s long history of voting Democratic in general elections. Collins is more moderate than some of her peers in the Senate, and penned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/gun-control-bipartisan-bill-congress-senate-house\">a compromise bill on gun control</a> earlier this year that has failed to gain traction. She was also the first Republican senator who <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/susan-collins-supports-same-sex-marriage-108339\">supports same-sex marriage</a> and won re-election in 2014.</p> <p>She maintained that she will help campaign for other Republicans, but not Trump.</p> <p>\u201cI revere the history of my party, most particularly the value it has always placed on the worth and dignity of the individual,\u201d she wrote, concluding: \u201cIt is because of Mr Trump\u2019s inability and unwillingness to honor that legacy that I am unable to support his candidacy.\u201d</p>",

He even doesn\u2019t resent being knocked down by Erislandy Savon, a Cuban heavyweight in the fine tradition and a nephew of the great Felix. On Monday night Okolie went over again, having been stopped in a round by Savon before the tournament, but got up and gave a decent account of himself to go the distance.<br></p> <p><br>\u201cIt was good and bad,\u201d he said, as a psychology student might. \u201cBad because I didn\u2019t get the decision, good because I\u2019ve progressed since our last fight. This time I went the three rounds. The knockdown took a lot of the momentum that I was trying to build.\u201d<br>His seemingly modest effort has to be put in context: Savon has had more than 250 amateur bouts; Okolie has now had 26 - and he would fight the Cuban again tomorrow if he could. He reckons he could be among the top four amateur heavyweights in the world, and says he is learning new tricks in every fight. Good place to learn them: at the Olympics against a Cuban.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking knowing there\u2019s someone better than me out there but it can\u2019t stay that way much longer.\u201d<br><br>Okolie said he took a call before the fight from the world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua, who took a close decision against Savon in London four years ago. \u201cHe told me to just relax,\u201d Okolie said. But not to the point of going on the canvas, he might have added.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a91c2ee4b0f5d064841a40\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T23:56:33.400Z\">12.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>And that\u2019s game, set and match for Serena Williams</strong> as she beats Alize Cornet in two sets (7-6, 6-2.)

Australia can add the Olympic title to their recent World Series triumph, and they are the undisputed queens of rugby sevens. The final score: 24-17. A brilliant achievement by these women. There are some pretty despondent faces in the Kiwi huddle at full-time, but it should be noted that New Zealand have also enjoyed a wonderful tournament and silver is a fantastic achievement. They bid goodbye to Rio with a tearful haka. There is nothing but joy in the Australian ranks though after a golden tournament and they will return home to a hero\u2019s welcome.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0c8a711515524c9be93fd01f33322c1fbb667cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0c8a711515524c9be93fd01f33322c1fbb667cc/0_0_3655_2424/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australia celebrate victory after winning gold.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australia celebrate victory after winning gold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Kolbe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T23:42:41.331Z\">at 12.42am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57a908f1e4b03b51a99e13bc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T22:37:28.459Z\">11.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to tennis and Cornet is really doing everything she can to make it hard for Williams, who looks extremely frustrated thus far.

It was always a tough draw, with the Frenchwoman ranked world No3 to Davis\u2019s 12, but the 23-year-old from London was determined to dwell on the positives, even in defeat.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the strongest I\u2019ve ever been. I came prepared today and you can have a hard draw and that\u2019s just judo. You get beaten on the day, that\u2019s just the way it is. You\u2019ve got to come back stronger, fitter. I 100% believe my day will come. I know I will be world champion, European champion and hopefully Olympic champion one day,\u201d she said. Tokyo 2020 will be her time, she vowed.</p> <p>She said she was mentally stronger than any of her opponents, largely because of her background. She was brought up by a single mother on a west London council estate and said the hard knocks toughened her up:</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have everything as a kid growing up. I didn\u2019t have a lot of materialistic things. My mum didn\u2019t have a lot of money. So dealing with those things, and my mum had quite a tough upbringing in life, she came over here from Jamaica with me to give us a better life. She always taught me not to take things for granted and anything you do get in life you\u2019ve got to work hard for. I think that\u2019s where my mental strength and toughness comes from, my mum being a single mum and how hard she struggled. I knew that I would have to put the work in in life to make something of myself and not be poor. So it really comes from that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ada8a8d1254c66fa49117500b04b6d022628d8ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ada8a8d1254c66fa49117500b04b6d022628d8ed/0_0_3500_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The women\u2019s sabre individual quarter-finals continues at the Carioca Arena.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"571\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The women\u2019s sabre individual quarter-finals continues at the Carioca Arena.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nacho Doce/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T16:20:58.265Z\">at 5.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57a8ade0e4b03b51a99e120c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T16:07:05.322Z\">5.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Paul Drinkhall is in table tennis action now against Andrej Gacina of Croatia in round four</strong>.

  "<p>Cardiff may be talked-up as one of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-30847525\" rel=\"nofollow\">UK\u2019s fastest growing cities</a> with a global outlook in film and TV (the BBC and Pinewood have large bases here), but locals extol Cardiff\u2019s sense of camaraderie. Grassroots cultural activity is increasing but often with assistance from established arts centres, such as the excellent <a href=\"http://www.chapter.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chapter</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s collegiate,\u201d says Kate Wasserberg, artistic director at pub theatre, the <a href=\"http://www.otherroomtheatre.com/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Other Room</a>. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t an organisation in Wales that didn\u2019t lend us something.\u201d</p> <p>That mutual assistance is particularly important for Cardiff\u2019s music scene, which, critics argue, gets little political support. In recent years, the city has lost several venues, including the Coal Exchange and the Point, due to a familiar mixture of noise complaints, business pressures and redevelopment. The 1,000-capacity <a href=\"http://tramshedcardiff.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tramshed</a> is a new addition but, says John Rostron, creator of <a href=\"http://swnfest.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">S\u0175n festival</a> (October 21 \u2013 23), music is still undervalued locally. There is certainly no shortage of musical talent or energy. Beyond cult Cardiff exports such as Gwenno and Joanna Gruesome, taste-makers flag-up a raft of emerging acts: Junior Bill\u2019s indie-ska; singer-songwriter Dan Bettridge; experimental pop crackpots Islet; Darkhouse Family and their adventures in bass music. Such creativity is supported by a network of small labels (Bubblewrap, Jealous Lovers Club, Flower of Phong), festivals such as HUB and Shape Records\u2019 From Now On, and a host of DIY promoters from club outfits <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bluehoneycardiff\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blue Honey</a> and City Bass to the Joy Collective, which pushes queer/feminist punk and experimental music.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3A1158800571%3Aplaylist%3A018ELEg8tR55oYDFXWbcLB\"> <iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:1158800571:playlist:018ELEg8tR55oYDFXWbcLB\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"http://thejoycollective.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joy Collective</a> is part of a group currently fundraising to open a DIY gig and art space, Hotel de Marl. \u201cIf we band together we can make something tangible,\u201d says member Claire Vaughan. \u201cThe city keeps growing and big business threatens spaces that two years ago would have been affordable.\u201d</p> <p>That pressure may explain why so much of the best stuff in indie food and drink is happening not in the city centre, but out in the suburbs of Canton or studenty Cathays.

Well, he didn\u2019t disappoint, telling every mainstream audience there was \u201cno empirical evidence to show that carbon dioxide affects the climate in any way\u201d. <br></p> <p>I\u2019ve written several stories over the years about Roberts and the Galileo Movement \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.desmogblog.com/denial-down-under-galileo-movement\">climate science denial group founded in 2011</a> with radio personality Alan \u201cclimate change is witchcraft\u201d Jones as its patron. </p> <p>Three years ago I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2013/aug/16/climate-change-denial-science-politics-australia-one-nation\">pointed out how One Nation was taking its cues on climate science from Roberts</a>. Last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2016/jul/05/pauline-hansons-one-nation-to-bring-climate-science-denial-to-the-senate\">I suggested that, if elected,</a> Roberts would bring an extreme form of climate science denial to the Senate.</p> <p>But for those paying close attention to climate science denial \u2013 such as the string of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2016/jul/12/us-senators-detail-a-climate-science-web-of-denial-but-the-impacts-go-well-beyond-their-borders\">US senators who spent hours talking about it only last month</a> \u2013 Roberts sounds like a broken record. In Roberts\u2019 case, the needle has been stuck for about six years. </p> <p>What about his conspiracy theories (he says they\u2019re not conspiracies, just facts) that climate change is a scam pushed by global banks looking for cash and the UN on the hunt for global domination? Roberts didn\u2019t disappoint there either. <br></p> <p>On <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/774-abc-melbourne/one-nation-senator-elect-malcolm-roberts-with-raf-epstein\">ABC Melbourne</a>, host Rafael Epstein asked Roberts: \u201cDo you think the UN\u2019s trying to impose some sort of global government through climate change policy?\u201d </p> <p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d replied Roberts. \u201cReally?\u201d checked Epstein. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d confirmed Roberts. </p> <p>For years, Roberts has been writing to politicians, government agencies, universities and scientists making the same claim that there is \u201cno empirical evidence\u201d to show fossil fuel burning causes climate change.</p> <p>You can go and read all that <a href=\"http://www.climate.conscious.com.au/\">material on his website</a> \u2013 I\u2019ll see you in six months once you\u2019ve read it all.</p> <h2>Empirical evidence?</h2> <p>So what does Roberts mean by \u201cempirical evidence\u201d? According to him, decisions should be based on \u201cobservations in the real world \u2026 it\u2019s measured, real world data\u201d and nothing else counts. </p> <p>There are two very obvious problems with Roberts\u2019 argument. </p> <p>The \u201creal world data\u201d is sending a clear message that the Earth is gaining heat at a rapid rate and that this is a long-term trend. Whether you look at global air temperatures measured in the real world by thermometers or derived from satellites, or the temperature of the oceans at multiple depths, or the increasing frequency of extreme temperatures, or the rising sea levels, the melting ice sheets, the disappearing Arctic sea ice, the increasing risk of bushfires \u2026 we could go on and on with a parade of \u201cempirical evidence\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Anyone can claim there is no evidence if they refuse to look at it.</p> <footer> <cite>Professor Steven Sherwood, UNSW</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the same time, humans are adding CO2 to the atmosphere and oceans at a rate that groups like the Geological Society say are unprecedented \u201ceven in comparison with the massive injections of carbon to the atmosphere at the Palaeocene-Eocene boundary, which led to a major thermal event 55m years ago\u201d.</p> <p>Roberts\u2019 argument that science is only about \u201cempirical evidence\u201d might sound all sciencey to his interviewees and the lay audience. But it\u2019s bunk. </p> <p>If all you rely on is \u201cempirical evidence\u201d, and reject modelling and analysis that uses that data, then you basically throw out large swathes of modern scientific endeavours. </p> <p>Prof Steven Sherwood, director of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, told me: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The argument is specious.</p> <p>Anyone can claim there is no evidence if they refuse to look at it. In Galileo\u2019s time, some people refused to look into his telescope and then claimed there was no evidence to support what he was saying. Same thing today.</p> <p>The problem is that evidence does not stand up by itself and announce the answer to any given question. Evidence must be interpreted by humans. Scientists have all interpreted the evidence, going back decades, and unanimously agree that it proves beyond a reasonable doubt that (a) humans are increasing CO2 and (b) this is causing warming. There is not a single respectable atmospheric scientist in the world whom I know of, who disagrees with either of these conclusions (there are a handful who challenge the magnitude of the effect but that\u2019s a different question).</p> <p>It is impossible to make a prediction based on data alone. Only a model can make a prediction of anything that has not happened yet.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Denial suite</h2> <p>Roberts has built a whole suite of well-rehearsed arguments to enable him to reject any assertions put to him.</p> <p>They go like this, and I\u2019m paraphrasing here. Climate scientists only say it\u2019s warming because if they didn\u2019t their grants would dry up. The Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO have corrupted climate science and are thus guilty of corruption. Government agencies are politicised, which means anything they produce cannot be trusted. You can\u2019t trust climate models, so anything that comes from them should be chucked out.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>[Roberts] has no understanding of how science works.</p> <footer> <cite>Professor Peter Doherty, Nobel winner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of Australia\u2019s most famous and celebrated scientists is Prof Peter Doherty, who, in 1996, was jointly awarded a Nobel prize for his research into the immune system. </p> <p>Doherty told me he had sent Roberts \u201cplenty of reports and material\u201d but Roberts had ignored it.</p> <p>So Doherty has first-hand experience with Roberts and also knows a bit about the scientific method. He told me: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve never used the term \u2018empirical evidence\u2019, or heard any other working scientist say it. [Roberts] has no understanding of how science works.</p> <p>Discoveries in science stem from a mix of hypothesis, experiment, data generation, data analysis, insight and even a bit of guesswork. Telling the story of what\u2019s happening in something as complex as climate science further depends on integrating information from a diverse spectrum of fields, then designing to see if the conclusions are valid or false. There\u2019s a constant process of correction and further interpretation that then has to be supported by measurement.</p> <p>You can tell a genuine sceptic from a denier (as I discuss in <a href=\"https://www.mup.com.au/items/160807\">The Knowledge Wars</a>) because the sceptic will want to look at new data and conclusions and, like any real scientist, will modify their conclusions accordingly. The denier remains \u2018locked in\u2019 to a sort of \u2018<a href=\"http://www.d.umn.edu/~jfitzake/Lectures/DMED/MotorControl/SupraspinalControl/DecerebrateRigidity.html\">decerebrate rigidity</a>\u2019.</p> <p>All good scientists are sceptical, not least about their own data and conclusions. Further data show that we\u2019re wrong, and we prefer not to be wrong, so people change their positions with new evidence. And, if you want to understand very complex, interactive systems, you have to use modelling approaches.</p> <p>With climate science, data is coming in from a very broad spectrum of scientific disciplines that no one person can pull together ... thus the IPCC.</p> </blockquote> <p>So how should journalists react when a newly-minted senator makes claims that run against science academies across the planet while suggesting institutions and governments the world over \u2013 from the <a href=\"http://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/612710\">US military</a> to the UN \u2013 are either part of, or have been hoodwinked by, a conspiracy that only he can and a few other people on the internet are able to see?</p> <p>Deference? Respect? Polite engagement?</p> <p>According to Doherty \u201cyou have to respect the institutions of our democracy, including the Australian Senate, but that does not mean you have to respect the viewpoints held by individual senators\u201d.</p> <p>So there is another approach journalists could take.</p> <p>In 2013, Roberts sent one of his voluminous reports to Ben Cubby, then the environment editor at the Sydney Morning Herald. I\u2019ll leave you with <a href=\"http://www.desmogblog.com/2013/02/28/climate-change-conspiracy-theorist-s-report-pile-horse-shit-writes-environment-editor\">Cubby\u2019s response</a>. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In considering your request that I identify errors in the report you sent to me \u2013 <em>CSIROh!

  "<p>Australia\u2019s offshore camps are a house of cards. They\u2019re unsustainable and liable to collapse amid increasing corporate aversion to complicity in abuse, legal uncertainty and human despair. <br></p> <p> The arrangements rest precariously on four pillars: corporate complicity in abuse; legal and regulatory frameworks that allow innocent people to be warehoused indefinitely; the public\u2019s willingness to accept deliberate cruelty to innocent people; and bipartisan political support. </p> <p>After years of uncertainty, hopelessness and abuse in the camps, only the final pillar holds strong and even the collusion of our major parties can\u2019t avert the looming chaos. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/05/refugees-dont-self-harm-because-of-me-peter-dutton-they-self-harm-because-of-you\">Refugees don't self-harm because of me Peter Dutton, they self-harm because of you | Sarah Smith</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Confronted with mounting risks and liabilities, Ferrovial, the Spanish multinational that runs the camps on Nauru and Manus, has committed not to retender when its current contract expires. The contract was to end in February next year, but the Australian government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/08/detention-centre-operators-contract-extended-despite-owners-objection\">recently extended it for a further eight months</a>. Now Ferrovial must either exit the camps, or become mired in material risk \u2013 including operational uncertainty, exposure to legal action and the devastation of its reputation \u2013 until October 2017. </p> <p> Ferrovial\u2019s financial stakeholders have also come under fire. A recent <a href=\"http://hrlc.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Association_with_Abuse.pdf\">report</a> released by the Human Rights Law Centre and GetUp\u2019s No Business in Abuse campaign reveals the global banks and corporate investors linked to the offshore camps through their relationship with Ferrovial, and calls on them to take immediate action to end the business relationships that associate them with gross human rights abuse. </p> <p> Already the Norwegian Central Bank, which holds a stake in Ferrovial, has acknowledged the potential for an ethical problem and referred the issue to Norway\u2019s Council on Ethics for an independent judgment. This response will sound a warning to Ferrovial\u2019s prospective successors: business in abuse will hurt you. </p> <p> Ferrovial\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/30/new-manus-and-nauru-operator-signals-plans-to-quit-detention-centre-business\">decision to walk away</a> ought to deter any company considering profiting from human suffering. The government\u2019s decision to unilaterally extend the offshore contract despite Ferrovial\u2019s clear indication that it does not want to continue its work in the camps certainly suggests that the market is not crowded with contractors eager to step into Ferrovial\u2019s shoes. </p> <p> Cracks are also appearing in the legal framework underpinning the arrangements. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/26/papua-new-guinea-court-rules-detention-asylum-seekers-manus-unconstitutional\">highest court in PNG recently ruled that the Manus centre is illegal</a> and PNG prime minister Peter O\u2019Neill has conceded it must end. It took retrospective legal changes and a last minute opening of the gates to fend off a similar <a href=\"http://hrlc.org.au/high-court-set-to-hear-challenge-to-offshore-detention-on-nauru-nauru-announces-transition-to-open-centre/\">legal challenge</a> we made to the detention facility on Nauru. </p> <p> The PNG supreme court is currently considering exactly how it will enforce its own orders. It has demanded answers from the Australian and PNG governments about resettlement plans for the 900 men still languishing in limbo. Our government will pretend that everything is fine but something has clearly got to give. PNG sovereignty, so often used as a shield by successive Australian governments to deflect criticism of the Manus camp, is poised to become the sword, striking a blow to the core of the current detention arrangements.</p> <p> Finally, slowly but surely, public opinion is shifting. During the recent <a href=\"http://hrlc.org.au/letthemstay/\">#LetThemStay</a> campaign we saw the faces of 37 babies born in Australia but facing deportation to Nauru. These kids have never set foot on a boat but are classified by our laws as if they arrived on one, meaning they face mandatory deportation to a tiny island. Also at risk were men violently beaten on Manus, women who had been sexually assaulted on Nauru and over 50 children, many of whom had been going to Australian schools and were beginning to rebuild their lives in our communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/08/detention-centre-operators-contract-extended-despite-owners-objection\">Detention centre operator's contract extended despite new owner's objection</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The response to their plight was phenomenal.

So the trajectory of public opinion is clear. People are realising that the status quo is unsustainable, cruel and fundamentally wrong. </p> <p> Pressure is clearly building. Rather than waiting for the current system to collapse the Turnbull government must look at innovative, humane policy alternatives. And they do exist \u2013 instead of using costly and cruel measures to close unsafe pathways, we could look at smart ways of opening up new ones. Measures which improve conditions in transit countries and re-allocate skilled migration places to skilled people who are also seeking asylum should be considered. </p> <p> The Manus and Nauru camps are dead ends, not long-term solutions.

Even more remarkable is that top neoconservatives in the party are all taking the Democrat\u2019s side: Clinton has said Trump \u201cshouldn\u2019t have his finger on the button\u201d of our nuclear arsenal. It looks like even Republican top brass agrees.</p> <p>On Thursday <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/08/politics/republican-national-security-letter-donald-trump-election-2016/\">a long list of GOP national security hands wrote a letter</a> saying Trump would be \u201cthe most reckless president in American history\u201d and that electing him in November would but the nation\u2019s security at risk. Some of the 50 signatories said they\u2019d vote for Clinton while others deemed it better to abstain from voting entirely. But all were in fundamental agreement on one main point: \u201cTrump is not qualified and would be dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>This comes after Evan McMullin, a former CIA official who recently worked for the House Republican conference, filed papers to run for president as an independent candidate. He doesn\u2019t support Clinton, and having missed the ballot-access deadlines in most states, the move is expected to have little effect on the race other than to help the former secretary of state by cutting into Trump\u2019s margins.

It was the latest sign of traditional Republicans, usually a fractious group, striking at Trump while the nominee reels under signs of cratering poll numbers and self-inflicted political wounds.</p> <p>Many of the signatories have made their doubts known before. A March letter published at the online national-security salon<a href=\"http://warontherocks.com/2016/03/open-letter-on-donald-trump-from-gop-national-security-leaders/\"> War on The Rocks</a> sounded warnings on Trump\u2019s character, policies and fitness for office. It included many who signed the current letter, including George W Bush\u2019s homeland-security secretary Michael Chertoff; ex-Pentagon undersecretary for policy and ambassador to Turkey Eric Edelman; Condoleezza Rice aide Philip Zelikow; John McCain advisers Richard Fontaine and Kori Schake; and former US ambassador to Iraq Robert Blackwill.</p> <p>But the previous letter was penned in the midst of the Republican primary, when several other candidates remained competitive in the race. For dozens of high-profile intelligence officials to rebuke their own party\u2019s nominee with the general election officially underway is yet another indication of the unprecedented nature of Trump\u2019s candidacy.</p> <p>The new letter also arrives amid heightened concerns over Trump posture toward Russia -- the former reality TV star has lavished unusual praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin, while his campaign manager Paul Manafort has been scrutinized for holding ties to Russian politicians. Former CIA acting director Michael Morrell, who endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton this weekend, has insinuated that Putin is manipulating an unwitting Trump.</p> <p>Signing the new letter are former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden, who has let his antipathy to Trump be highly public in recent months, and John Negroponte, a senior official in the Reagan, George HW Bush and Clinton administrations and George W Bush\u2019s first director of national intelligence. So did George W Bush\u2019s White House Iraq and Afghanistan adviser, Meghan O\u2019Sullivan, who is held in high esteem amongst congressional Republican internationalists.</p> <p>The new letter also contains harsher language than the old. While the March letter compared Trump to a \u201cracketeer,\u201d the new one flatly says Trump \u201clacks the temperament to be President.\u201d It also calls into question his fitness to wield \u201ccommand of the US nuclear arsenal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnlike previous Presidents who had limited experience in foreign affairs, Mr. Trump has shown no interest in educating himself,\u201d the letter states. \u201cHe continues to display an alarming ignorance of basic facts of contemporary international politics.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton campaign has also sought to cast a spotlight on Trump\u2019s competence to be commander-in-chief as voters grow increasingly alarmed over national security. The Democratic National Convention featured a cadre of generals, admirals and former officials from Republican administrations making the case against Trump in primetime, honing in on his erratic behavior and wayward statements on US foreign policy.</p> <p>The Clinton campaign also released a video stringing together clips of both national security officials and former Republican presidential candidates, from Mitt Romney to Marco Rubio, stating that Trump was fundamentally unqualified to be president and should not have access to the nuclear codes.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a8ed45e4b0f5d06484198a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T20:36:39.628Z\">9.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Video: </strong>Donald Trump sought to regain momentum with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">an economic speech</a> in which he floated new tax breaks and cuts to regulation, as protesters repeatedly interrupted him.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-outlines-economic-plan-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q3zq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2640383\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump outlines his economic plan \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a8d83ee4b0f5d064841920\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/08/160808economy_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-outlines-economic-plan-video\">Donald Trump outlines his economic plan</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>He told the Detroit Economic Club, a traditional venue for political candidates to discuss their economic vision, that his plan would include imposing a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations, and reducing rates for income and corporate taxes.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a8dbd7e4b03b51a99e12f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/amber-jamieson\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T20:21:09.058Z\">9.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Currently the <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=mobilebar&amp;v=1#now\">New York Time\u2019s Fiverthirtyeight blog</a> has Clinton\u2019s odds of winning the election - if it was held today - at 94%.
