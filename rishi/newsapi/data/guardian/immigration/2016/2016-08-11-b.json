  "<p>Another victim of college sexual assault has released a statement on the trauma of the attack and ensuing trial, offering a powerful depiction of rape culture and victim-blaming that echoes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/06/stanford-sexual-assault-case-victim-impact-statement-in-full\">viral letter</a> of the woman at the center of the high-profile Stanford sexual assault case.</p> <p>Austin James Wilkerson, a 22-year-old former University of Colorado student, was convicted of sexually assaulting a \u201chelpless\u201d and \u201chalf-conscious\u201d first-year student after he told friends he would take care of her. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/university-of-colorado-sexual-assault-austin-wilkerson\">Prosecutors say</a> Wilkerson repeatedly tried to cover up the crime and lied under oath about the full extent of the assault against the vulnerable woman.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/university-of-colorado-sexual-assault-austin-wilkerson\">No prison for Colorado college student who \u2018raped a helpless young woman'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite the guilty verdict by a jury, Judge Patrick Butler decided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/university-of-colorado-sexual-assault-austin-wilkerson\">not to send Wilkerson to prison</a> this week with a ruling that closely resembles the lenient sentencing of former <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/02/stanford-swimmer-sexual-assault-brock-allen-turner-palo-alto\">Stanford swimmer Brock Turner</a>. </p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian on Thursday, the victim said that she was motivated to share her story and impact statement after seeing other survivors of sexual assault come forward:</p> <p>\u201cAlthough I did have to re-live the trauma multiple times, I would go through this process all over again. Our goal has been to have the rapist not perpetrate again, which hopefully won\u2019t happen even with the light sentence. We get to put a face to the 1-in-4 statistics. Surprisingly, this whole ordeal has been therapeutic. I get to tell my story and not keep it bottled up.\u201d </p> <p>She continued, \u201cOther brave survivors\u2019 eerily familiar stories have inspired me to share my story that rape isn\u2019t always a stranger in the bushes.\u201d </p> <p>Here is the 21-year-old woman\u2019s full statement to the court: </p> <p><em>\u201cHis life is ruined.\u201d Oh yeah, and it\u2019s not like my life isn\u2019t ruined or anything. It\u2019s always been about the rapist since the assault. As the victim of this sexual assault, my life has been ruined socially, psychologically, academically, and financially. </em></p> <p><em>To begin with, this sexual assault has ruined me socially. I don\u2019t go to CU football games anymore. I don\u2019t drink at parties anymore. I don\u2019t even go out anymore. This is partially because I\u2019m too scared to be in situations that remind me of the sexual assault. But it\u2019s also in part because of all the victim-blaming that I have internalized. Instead of having the typical fun 21<sup>st</sup> birthday celebration, I was saying that I couldn\u2019t go to the bars with everyone because I had too much homework. In reality, I was too scared of my friends\u2019 friends because the rapist was a friend of a friend. Another instance of being afraid of my friends\u2019 friends was my living situation for the 2015-2016 school year. My friend and I were going to live with our group of friends. However, during the contract negotiation, my supposed friends sprung a new roommate on us. I was fine with this for the most part, until my \u201cfriends\u201d had the new roommate share a bathroom and floor with us girls. These were not the terms I consented to. Everyone thought I was being irrational for not wanting to share a bathroom and be on the same floor level as their friend, who was a guy I had met only twice. I feel like those dogs who become afraid or don\u2019t like being around certain people. In my case, I\u2019m afraid of acquaintances, since this sexual assault was an acquaintance rape. Safety is my #1 priority, even if it means jeopardizing relationships. </em></p> <p><em>\u201cOh boo hoo,\u201d you might say. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t get to go out and party and have fun. Big deal.\u201d But it\u2019s not just socially, it\u2019s psychologically. It\u2019s the anxiety. When I started filing this sexual assault case with CU back in the fall of 2014, I had a horrible nightmare that the rapist was going to retaliate against me. He was going to kill me with a bomb. I tried to tell the authorities, but they wouldn\u2019t listen. I woke up from this nightmare crying. I immediately called my mom and told her I couldn\u2019t go to class because the rapist was on campus. She reassured me that he wouldn\u2019t retaliate against me because there would be consequences. I reluctantly agreed to go to class, but in the back of my mind I thought about how the rapist had committed this horrific crime knowing that there would be consequences. So what would stop him from retaliating? On campus I was on high alert, constantly checking over my shoulder. Keep in mind that CU didn\u2019t have a Criminal Protection Order. All CU said was that if we crossed paths, he would have to turn and go the other way. However, this didn\u2019t happen. After the trial conviction, the rapist was in the waiting area. Instead of him turning around and going the other way \u2013 like everyone had reassured me he would do \u2013 the rapist stayed there. I was the one who was going the other way. The flight part of my fight-or-flight instincts kicked into overdrive. I practically ran the other way so I wouldn\u2019t have to be anywhere near him. Even with the Criminal Protection Order and the court not allowing weapons, I did not feel safe around the rapist. And I never will. </em></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I\u2019m not having nightmares of rape, retaliation, or retrial that goes awry, I\u2019m having panic attacks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>When I\u2019m not having nightmares of rape, retaliation, or retrial that goes awry, I\u2019m having panic attacks. Like the nightmares, these started after the sexual assault. Prior to the assault, I never had a panic attack in my life. At first, I thought these panic attacks were random, but the more of them I had, the more a pattern emerged that aligned with the sexual assault: I would be peacefully sleeping when all of the sudden I would be jolted awake by this horrible thing happening to me. There wasn\u2019t much I could do except try to breathe through it \u2013 just try to survive \u2013 and wait for the horrible thing to be over with. Just. Like. The assault. One of the most vivid panic attacks I remember was again when I was filing this sexual assault case with CU in the fall of 2014. I was peacefully sleeping. Then I woke up to the horrible feeling that I was dying. I was so scared and confused that it felt like I was going crazy; it didn\u2019t feel real. When I could actually sit up and move \u2013 not frozen lying down \u2013 I asked my roommate to take me to the hospital. Of course once I got to the hospital they told me everything was fine. After going to the hospital another time, my parents told me that I had to stop going to the hospital. If something was wrong, I was to call my mom because she is a medical doctor and would be able to help. In the spring of 2015 I had yet another panic attack. I was peacefully sleeping when I was jolted awake. This time it felt like I was having a heart attack. It was a sharp, jabbing attack on my heart. About half an hour later it passed but I was still shaken. Instead of going to the hospital, I called my mom at four or five in the morning crying. Between uncontrollable sobs I told her that I had just had a heart attack. I told her my symptoms and she told me that the symptoms were not that of a heart attack. Even after her reassurance, I couldn\u2019t fall back asleep; I was too afraid to wake up to the horrible thing again.</em></p> <p><em>It\u2019s the depression. About a month after the assault, I tried to kill myself because of the impact of the sexual assault. Some days I can\u2019t even get out of bed, let alone do four readings, projects, and study for tests. And no wonder. The rapist made pleasurable things of sex, sleep, and going out traumatic. So it\u2019s no surprise that less pleasurable things like studying are 100 times more difficult. </em></p> <p><em>It really was a snowball effect: the rape affected me socially and psychologically, which in turn affected me academically. Every time I would try to put this trauma out of my mind, I would be reminded of it again and again with new updates, hearing dates, and trial dates. Like, \u201cHey, remember that traumatic thing that happened to you? Yeah you\u2019re gonna have to relive that in your retelling to CU-Boulder investigators; the DA\u2019s office; a detective; your therapist; your psychologist; your psychiatrist; your Office of Victim Assistance counselor; a judge; a jury; the rapist\u2019s family, affiliates, and legal team; your loved ones; and many others! Hope that doesn\u2019t put a damper on your school thing!\u201d Everything is a reminder. I can\u2019t escape the rapist figuratively or literally. For example, earlier this year my team and I went to New Mexico for a tournament. Back in Colorado, I returned to the unsettling news that the rapist was going to New Mexico the weekend after I went. What if he was there when I was? Would he supposedly turn around and go the other way? We\u2019ve seen how well that has worked\u2026</em></p> <p><em>Finally, financially. $250,000. $127,582 lost of future wages because I\u2019ll still be in school instead of working. Lower starting income because I\u2019ll only have an undergraduate degree instead of a master\u2019s degree: $14,698. Hospital bills from panic attacks: $5,000. Bills for antidepressants: $100. MESA trauma class: $90. Money spent on textbooks and material for failed and withdrawn classes: $10,000. Money lost on failed and withdrawn classes: $15,000. Money lost on having to do extra undergraduate years (which includes housing and living expenses): $20,000. Bills from suicide attempt resulting in MIP, hospitalization, and BASICS classes: $4,000. $52,900 for my parents\u2019 time, my time, and gas spent for meetings and trial. The $250,000 doesn\u2019t even include a lifetime of future expenses of therapy, antidepressants, etc. as a result of this sexual assault. But it\u2019s only the rapist\u2019s life that has been ruined, right? It\u2019s not like I had hopes and dreams or academic and career goals. </em></p> <p><em>But worst of all is the victim-blaming. Freshman year, one of my roommates, who you met at trial, was victim-blaming. At the end of April 2014, our floor was talking about how we saw this girl throwing up outside of our Williams Village dorm, Darley North. A few days after that, we received an email saying that a girl had reported a rape to the police. The rape was perpetrated after a party in a WillVill dorm by someone she knew. Some people on our floor speculated that maybe the girl we saw throwing up outside our dorm was the one who was raped. My roommate chimed in, \u201cWell, if she was that drunk, then she deserved to get raped.\u201d I was livid and vehemently defended the victim, and this was before I had even processed the sexual assault perpetrated against me. But my roommate wasn\u2019t the only one who was victim-blaming; it was a person (or persons) in the jury. Following my breaking down and crying and getting ridiculed about the sexual assault, someone in the jury had the audacity to ask me why I didn\u2019t say, \u201cNo.\u201d The real question is, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the rapist get my consent?!\u201d It would be like if someone robbed you and they said, \u201cWell you didn\u2019t say no!\u201d Does a lack of a \u201cno\u201d make the robbery okay? Of course not! Even my own mother was victim-blaming. She told me that if I hadn\u2019t been drunk, this wouldn\u2019t have happened. Yet, it was excusable for him to rape me because he was drunk. After all I\u2019ve endured emotionally, physically, psychologically, and financially, the burden of the blame still crashes down on my shoulders. </em></p> <p><em>Therefore, it\u2019s my contention that the maximum sentence would be the most suitable. I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about running into the rapist at CU football games or on campus or even in New Mexico. The best reassurance \u2013 not CU\u2019s, \u201cOh he\u2019ll just go the other way!\u201d \u2013 would be to know that the rapist cannot physically get to me. Please don\u2019t be like CU\u2019s director of student conduct, who had total disregard for my safety and the safety of others by allowing the rapist to go to an on-campus comedy show after he was found guilty of multiple counts of sexual assault. Please don\u2019t be like CU\u2019s director of student conduct, who suspended the rapist from CU for just over a year, meaning that he would be allowed back on campus while I was still attending. Basically, please don\u2019t be like CU\u2019s director of student conduct, who sacrificed the safety of the community in favor of the rapist\u2019s pleasure. Knowing that the rapist cannot physically get to anyone would give the community and me a peace of mind \u2013 well, at least for a little while out of my lifelong suffering. Have as much mercy for the rapist as he did for me the night of the sexual assault, which was none. </em></p> <p><em>In conclusion, the rapist CHOSE to ruin his life. But like the sexual assault itself, my life has been ruined without my consent. </em></p>",

Cycling road races turn on the whims of the peloton or the mechanical sturdiness of one\u2019s bike. Any of the top 15 fencers can medal on a given day.<br></p> <p>This is not one of those events. The all-around is akin to weightlifting, in which only a handful of athletes will even attempt a medal-winning performance. Difficulty is a big part of the scoring, so if you\u2019re only the 12th-best gymnast in the world, you have to hit all your own routines while hoping the seven to eight people trying more difficult routines flop on the mat.</p> <p>The top non-American gymnast in qualifying was from the home country \u2013 Brazil\u2019s Rebeca Andrade. She\u2019ll have a legitimate shot at the podium, but the two Russians behind her, Seda Tutkhalian and Aliya Mustafina, are capable as well. </p> <p>But this is, in the most literal sense, the Americans\u2019 event to lose. Consider the qualifying score: Simone Biles 62.366, Aly Raisman 60.607, Andrade 58.732. Those are larger margins than they appear \u2013 the gap from third to 30th was smaller than gap from first to third. </p> <p>If you\u2019re in the United States and don\u2019t want the results spoiled before you see them on NBC tonight, you\u2019ll have to stop reading now. Better yet, just open up the live stream in another browser window. Choose the general \u201cwomen\u2019s all-around final\u201d stream to get the lively commentary \u2013 not the same stuff you\u2019ll hear tonight on NBC, but some entertaining and informative former Olympians Jonathan Horton and Courtney Kupets Carter.

In the meantime, read why Simone Biles is making us think again:</em></p> <p>The Biles back story is an uplifting tale of a fostered child brought up in modest circumstances by a grandfather who indulged her drive to succeed. In terms of her impact on the sport, she represents something else: a return of the quest for perfection.</p> <p>This is the aspect that lifts gymnastics from the sweaty floormats into the philosophical \u2013 the search for the perfect routine, balanced between artistry and athletic achievement. In athletics, the four-minute mile and the 10-second 100 metres sprint were once the equivalent ultimate goals. In clock-timed sports, the difference of a split second makes scoring easier. Ice-skating allows for individual differences between judges (older readers will remember the East German judge jokes for giving low scores to any other nations). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gymnastics\">Gymnastics</a> aggregates scores between the judges on two separate panels to come to final result, often with a fair bit of arguing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/11/simone-biles-olympics-rio-2016-ideal-perfection-gymnastics\">Simone Biles makes us rethink the ideal of perfection in sport | Anne McElvoy</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

Smith says he does not need to be a mind reader because Corbyn had opposed the EU for 30 years.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>During the referendum you seemed to have undergone a Damascene conversion.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Gender equality</h2> <p>Labour have just selected four men as candidates for regional mayoral elections next May and both candidates were quizzed on what the party could do to ensure greater gender equality. </p> <p>Particularly, both were asked if there should have been some all women shortlists for the mayoral selection processes. </p> <p>Corbyn says he believes it was not the leader\u2019s job to decide on AWS for regional mayors, which should be up to the local party.</p> <p>Smith, however, said he as party leader would have insisted on at least one all women shortlist. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The party leader should have insist on one of those [mayoralties], at least, being an all woman shortlist.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Leadership</h2> <p>Smith\u2019s key argument in areas where both men seemed to agree in principle was about leadership and the electibility of the party. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All of the policies we want to put in place all of the principles we hold dear are worth nought because we will not be able to translate any of that into power.</p> </blockquote> <p>Corbyn, whose team have launched a rebuttal website this evening to challenge claims he is not successful electorally, said Smith was ignoring the huge surge in membership under his leadership. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Owen, our party is a strong party, our party is a big party, our campaigning abilities are immense if we work together on those campaign.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Smith said the current tactics were reminiscent of the time the party was out of power for 18 years. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve had mass rallies, we\u2019ve had a big party and we\u2019ve lost successive elections. We know how this one ends, Jeremy, and it doesn\u2019t end well for the working people of Britain. It\u2019s not about the t-shirts we wear and the badges on our lapels.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI think people should wear the t-shirs they want to,\u201d responded Corbyn, calmly.</p> <h2>Defence</h2> <p>Corbyn says we must have a foreign policy \u201cbased on human rights, international law, so we become known as a force that is determined to make sure the universal declaration is enforced in all places\u201d.</p> <p>He says he would aim to eventually lower defence spending, below the 2% of GDP that Nato asks its members to spend. Later, in a discussion about whether he would ever support military action, Corbyn said he would never rule out the possibility, but said there had to be better checks and balances.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Chilcott report makes pretty sobering reading.. how we ended up in a war we knew was questionably legal.. We have to have a different, less aggressive foreign policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Smith says he would maintain 2%. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We live in a more volatile world... when I see the prospect of Donald Trump in power in America, when I see Vladimir Putin in charge in Russia, I don\u2019t think now is a time for Britain to shirk its responsibilities.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s all from me tonight, thank you for reading and for your comments. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57acdc48e4b0fe7550974ec5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/frances-perraudin\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-11T20:17:45.525Z\">9.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague Frances Perraudin has been chatting to supporters and audience members both before and after the debate.

A commentary issued by China\u2019s state news agency warned on Thursday of<a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-08/11/c_135587086.htm\" title=\"\"> the dangers of \u201cChina-phobia\u201d</a>, and in truth, a strain of lurking Yellow Perilism can sometimes be discerned indiscussions, as if business activity was not being conducted to make money, but as a front for some more sinister purpose.</p> <p>Acknowledging such prejudices does not mean ignoring the fact that China and western countries have different values and beliefs about the rules by which companies and countries play. China\u2019s conception of national security extends far into industrial and even cultural realms. The line between state and commercial actors and interests is&#xa0;blurred; no company can defy authorities on a significant issue. And foreign businesses&#xa0;in China complain of an increasingly hostile atmosphere.</p> <p>It is only right and sensible to seek engagement with the world\u2019s second largest economy, and its cooperation and investment brings considerable benefits \u2013 especially evident in light of the vote to leave the EU. It is also sensible to scrutinise and manage foreign investments carefully, as experts such&#xa0;as <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/en/persons/nigel-s-inkster\" title=\"\">Nigel Inkster</a>, formerly of MI6, advocate, acknowledging the challenges they pose not only in infrastructure but also in areas such as the tech sector, which may provide the future innovation that will drive the UK economy. Some deals may not be appropriate; others may need to be structured and monitored carefully. The question is not whether to do business with&#xa0;China, but when and how to do it.</p>",

I even bought a T-shirt.

The answer involves 80 years of arcane history, and&#xa0;a baffling soup of splinter groups and cliques, from the International Marxist Group and the Workers Revolutionary party, to the Socialist Workers party and&#xa0;the Revolutionary Socialist League.&#xa0;We have not space to list them all here; neither would most people have the mental appetite.</p> <p>Suffice to say that a great deal of the current fuss goes back to <a href=\"http://www.militant.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Militant</a> \u2013 aka the Militant tendency \u2013 which initially took root in Merseyside, and whose people began to join the Labour party in the early 1960s. Twenty or so years later, buoyed by the fact that many local Labour parties were moribund and inward-looking and some people wanted a much more energetic politics, they had a lot going for them: their own newspaper, a clandestine organisation inside Labour, and two MPs, as well as control of Liverpool city council (whose most vocal figurehead was the legendary <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DegsyHatton\" title=\"\">Derek Hatton</a>, a man who eventually became involved in <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/fameandfortune/3129837/Fame-and-Fortune-Derek-Hatton-the-militant-capitalist.html\" title=\"\">the great proletarian pastime of property development</a>). Most of this was secured via \u201centryism\u201d, which goes back to one of Trotsky\u2019s tactical feints in the 1930s, whereby he <a href=\"http://www.bolshevik.org/1917/no9/no09frnt.html\" title=\"\">urged his followers in France</a> to cease operating as a separate political unit, and quietly crowd into the mainstream Socialist party.</p> <p>The practice of Trotskyist politics has long been built around the idea of the \u201ctransitional demand\u201d, a rather cynical manoeuvre whereby you encourage people to agitate for this or that \u2013 a hugely increased minimum wage, perhaps, or the end of all immigration controls \u2013 knowing full well it is unattainable within the current order of things, but that when the impossibility becomes apparent, the workers will belatedly wake up. In other words, the herd gets whipped up into a frenzy about something you know it won\u2019t get, while you smugly sit things out, hoping that if everything aligns correctly, another crack will appear in the great bourgeois edifice. For non-Trots, what this kind of game entails is obvious: in tandem with the aforementioned entryism, it means you never know quite what you are dealing with.</p> <p>I know this feeling well. Back in 1986, brimming with the socialist passions I had partly soaked up from such musicians as Billy Bragg and Paul Weller, I co-founded a branch of the Labour party\u2019s youth wing in the well-known socialist hotbed of Tatton \u2013 then represented by the soon to be disgraced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/10/neil-hamilton-disgraced-mp-celebrity-political-comeback-ukip\" title=\"\">MP Neil Hamilton</a>, and these days the adopted home turf of George Osborne. But the Labour Party Young Socialists, as it was known, was then controlled by Militant, and soon enough a few of their troops popped up in the constituency, quickly gaining control of the branch and the two seats it was granted on the local Labour general management committee. God knows what they were thinking: today Wilmslow, Knutsford and Northwich; tomorrow the world?</p> <p>What happened to me in the interim was grim: repeatedly being accused of \u201cnot knowing my history\u201d (true: I was 16) and becoming so miserable about a mixture of unpleasant behaviour and ulterior motives that one night I got home from yet another meeting and burst into tears. That was me done: after a last blast of activism in a nearby constituency where Militant was apparently not active, I jacked in the Labour party for the best part of 15 years.</p> <p>Such was a very small manifestation of a brief but grim phase of Labour history. But if it\u2019s all once again relevant, so might be one of its subplots: the fact that while the party leadership was rounding on Militant (who would eventually reappear as the Socialist party), among the people who opposed its chasing-out was Corbyn.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m50rq6BgQg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5m50rq6BgQg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The Labour party moves against Militant, 1985</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The details are in a freshly published edition of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/28/militant-michael-crick-review-jeremy-corbyn-labour-party\" title=\"\">Michael Crick\u2019s book Militant</a>: the fact that as expulsions began, Corbyn struck a loud note of common cause from his part of the Labour left (\u201cIf expulsions are in order for Militant, they should apply to us too\u201d), and was even the \u201cprovisional convenor\u201d of something called the Defeat the Witch-Hunt campaign. His stance reflected the position of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/15/jeremy-corbyn-world-supporters-mentors-influences\" title=\"\">his guru Tony Benn</a>, who cleaved to the old maxim \u201cNo&#xa0;enemies on the left\u201d. Beyond an official insistence that the Socialist party remains a \u201cproscribed organisation\u201d, the extent to which the Labour leader still believes in such things is rather unclear: we may soon see, I suppose.</p> <p>There is something noble about the fact that the Trotskyists are still here. They may even have gone through their own New Labour-esque process of revision and reform: the Militants I knew always assured me that their revolutionary plan was based on nothing less than the nationalisation of the top 200 companies, but I see from the <a href=\"http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/main/Home\" title=\"\">Socialist party website </a>that this has now been reduced to a modest 150.</p> <p>Aside from all that, the Militant founder and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/leader-expelled-leftwing-group-militant-peter-taaffe-readmission-labour-corbyn\" title=\"\">big cheese Peter Taaffe reckons</a> not just that he has a good chance of soon <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/leader-expelled-leftwing-group-militant-peter-taaffe-readmission-labour-corbyn\" title=\"\">being readmitted to the party</a> that chucked him out all those years ago, but that when it comes to the Corbyn insurgency, \u201cThe lava of this revolution is still hot\u201d (tssss!) and that the new leader\u2019s adversaries will not \u201cstop the winds of history as they\u2019re developing at the moment\u201d.

  "<p>Donald Trump refused to back down from his false claim that Barack Obama was \u201cthe founder of Isis\u201d on Thursday, insisting: \u201cHe was the founder ... The way he got out of Iraq was the founding of Isis.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate was speaking to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, who had attempted to reframe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/donald-trump-calls-barack-obama-the-founder-of-isis\">his remark</a>, telling him: \u201cI know what you meant \u2013 you meant that he created the vacuum, he lost the peace.\u201d </p> <p>But Trump disagreed. \u201cNo, I meant that he\u2019s the founder of Isis, I do,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was the most valuable player \u2013 I gave him the most valuable player award. I give her too, by the way,\u201d he added of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>Trump did acknowledge that the root of his argument was that if Obama \u201chad done things properly, you wouldn\u2019t have had Isis\u201d, but he repeated: \u201cTherefore, he was the founder of Isis.\u201d </p> <p>And he doggedly pursued that line of thought in a later speech to homebuilders in Miami on Thursday, now suggesting it was Clinton who would be given \u201cthe most valuable player award\u201d by Islamic State. \u201cHer only competition is Barack Obama,\u201d he said, adding of Clinton: \u201cOh boy, is Isis hoping for her.\u201d </p> <p>Trump\u2019s remarks about Isis came while he is still dealing with backlash from his hint that gun rights supporters might attack Clinton, something that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/trump-assassination-remark-clinton-second-amendment\">seemed to cause genuine shock</a> in a country that has grown used to Trump pushing the boundaries of appropriate political discourse.

The Democratic candidate is 7.9 points ahead in the latest polling average <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">compiled by Real Clear Politics</a>.</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href=\"http://time.com/4447527/donald-trump-republican-national-committee/\">Time magazine claimed</a> that Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus had told Trump that if he did not manage to right his campaign, the party might abandon support for his presidential bid and focus instead on Republicans running for Congress elsewhere in the country.</p> <p>Quoting two anonymous party officials familiar with the conversation, Time said Priebus had told Trump that internal polling suggested he was on track to lose the election and that he would have been better off heading to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for a break than hitting the trail after the convention.</p> <p>Trump dismissed the story. \u201cReince Priebus is a terrific guy,\u201d he told Time. \u201cHe never said that.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton was attempting to shift the focus to the economy on Thursday with a speech in Detroit. She intended to try to make the case that Trump\u2019s policies would benefit him and his wealthy friends, and to characterize his plans as an update of \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d. </p> <p>Her speech was in part a response to one given by Trump in the beleaguered Rust Belt city <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">on Monday</a>, when he proposed dramatically slashing taxes, reducing income tax brackets from seven levels to three \u2013 of 12%, 25% and 33% \u2013 and eliminating income taxes for individuals who earn less than $25,000 annually, or $50,000 for a married couple. </p> <p>That speech had been intended to reboot his flagging campaign, but was soon overtaken by the controversy over his \u201csecond amendment people\u201d comments, which in turn gave way to Wednesday\u2019s remarks about Obama and Isis. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> have long sought to blame the turmoil in the Middle East on the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy, often criticizing the president for underestimating the threat Isis poses. But Trump has routinely gone a step further by stating directly that Obama is sympathetic to terrorists. Immediately after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/18/orlando-nightlcub-shooting-pulse-florida-attack-timeline\">12 June mass shooting</a> at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which left 49 dead and 53 injured, Trump said cryptically that Obama \u201cdoesn\u2019t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands\u201d. </p> <p>In his speech on Wednesday, the former reality TV star pointedly chose several times to repeat the president\u2019s full name, Barack Hussein Obama.</p> <p>The origins of Isis trace back to the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. The group has been deemed an offshoot of al-Qaida, which carried out the attacks on 9/11. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant terrorist viewed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/10/how-isis-crippled-al-qaida\">the founder of Isis</a>, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/08/iraq.alqaida\">killed in a US airstrike</a> in Baghdad in 2006.</p> <p>Although Isis has expanded rapidly during Obama\u2019s tenure, seizing in particular on the Syrian civil war, the administration has also made gains in its military campaign against the extremist group. US army Lt Gen Sean MacFarland said on Wednesday an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/isis-ranks-dwindle-to-15000-amid-retreat-on-all-fronts-claims-pentagon\">estimated 45,000 fighters</a> linked to Isis had been killed in the two years since the US-led military coalition against the network was launched.</p> <p>Trump has not articulated a clear strategy against Isis, other than to threaten a ruthless bombing campaign and continuously push his proposal to ban Muslim immigration from the US.</p>",
  "<p>Refugees moving to Germany may in future have to give police permission to search their social media accounts for suspicious posts, the interior minister has announced.<br></p> <p>Presenting a raft of anti-terror measures at a press conference on Thursday, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re announced that border police would pilot a scheme whereby refugees resettled in Germany under the deal between Turkey and the EU would have to hand over their smartphones for security checks if they did not have passports.</p> <p>\u201cIf you want to come to Germany, we have to make safety checks on you. And to make safety checks, we will ask you to show us your Facebook contacts from the last few months, which are public in principle anyway,\u201d he said. However, De Maizi\u00e8re admitted that it remained to be seen whether the time and cost would justify the effort.</p> <p>The scheme points to a growing frustration with traditional means of establishing a person\u2019s identity at border crossings. \u201cWe frequently encounter cases where refugees often don\u2019t carry identity documents, but do nearly all carry their smartphones,\u201d the minister said.</p> <p>The system whereby refugees are fingerprinted upon registering in the EU has also proven fallible, De Maizi\u00e8re said. In the case of the 16-year-old who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/about-20-people-injured-in-axe-attack-on-train-in-germany\">attacked a group of people</a> on a train near W\u00fcrzburg, a fingerprint had been taken, but it could not be matched with the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/asylum/identification-of-applicants/index_en.htm\">Europe-wide Eurodac database</a>.</p> <p>Smartphones, by contrast, are valuable tools for many refugees, allowing them to stay in touch with friends and relatives, and gather potentially lifesaving information.</p> <p>Earlier this week, German police arrested a Syrian asylum seeker suspected of planning to carry out an attack at the start of the Bundesliga football season. According to S\u00fcdwestrundfunk radio channel, photos showing fighting in Syria had been found on the suspect\u2019s phone and computer, although it was unclear whether he had taken them himself.</p> <p>Authorities in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands routinely take and examine mobile phones to help establish a refugee\u2019s identity if they have no formal documents with them when they enter the country. </p> <p>Danish immigration law authorises officials to temporarily confiscate phones if the devices are \u201cpresumed to be of importance in establishing a foreigner\u2019s identity\u201d. The provision predates a raft of tougher immigration controls introduced in Denmark earlier this year, including one that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/denmark-to-force-refugees-to-give-up-valuables-under-proposed-asylum-law\">allows police to seize</a> migrants\u2019 cash and some valuables to help pay for their accommodation. </p> <p><a href=\"http://politiken.dk/udland/fokus_int/Flygtningestroem/ECE3069835/politiet-tager-asylboerns-mobiler-ved-ankomst/\">Speaking to Politiken newspaper</a>, Richard Osterlund la Cour, a police spokesman, said: \u201cIf you come to the country and say you are from Syria, but have nothing but your face to prove it, your mobile phone is the best way to determine if you are telling the truth.\u201d</p> <p>The Danish practice made headlines earlier this year when a <a href=\"http://politiken.dk/udland/fokus_int/Flygtningestroem/ECE3069891/15-aarig-jeg-vil-bare-gerne-i-kontakt-med-min-familie/\">Politiken investigation revealed</a> that immigration officers had confiscated the mobile phones of 55 unaccompanied migrant children, with many having to wait up to a month for them to be returned. <br></p> <p>The pilot scheme is one of a number of anti-terror measures that De Maizi\u00e8re proposed after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/26/germany-bavaria-police-attacks-munich-ansbach-wurzburg\">spate of violent attacks</a> in southern Germany at the start of August, which have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/29/one-eye-on-the-emergency-exit-the-anxious-mood-in-germany-and-france\">raised security fears</a> in the country.</p> <p>Other measures include increasing the number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/25/germany-boosts-police-presence-warns-acts-of-terror-ansbach\">police and surveillance staff</a>, speeding up the deportation of foreign criminals and revoking German citizenship from dual nationals if they have been found fighting for militant groups abroad.

  "<p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2016/aug/04/how-legitimate-marriages-have-become-home-office-honey-traps\" title=\"\">in this column</a>, I recounted James\u2019s story. Preparing to get married at my church, and having received a letter from the register office to the effect that it accepted it wasn\u2019t a sham marriage, he had nonetheless been taken from his bed early one morning by the Home Office. James (not his real name) having got into the system through his marriage licence application, the Home Office\u2019s wedding gift was to lock him up&#xa0;for overstaying his visa. And when it unceremoniously grabbed him, it didn\u2019t say where it was taking him \u2013 it turned out to be the Verne immigration removal centre, in Portland, Dorset. On Wednesday, I went to see him.</p> <p>This, in itself, is unusual. On average, detainees receive about two visits a month in immigration removal centres. In the Verne, the average is 0.2 visits a month. The place is so far away from the cities from which many of the inmates have been taken, and from which their family, friends and solicitors have to travel, it has been dubbed Britain\u2019s loneliest migrant centre. From London, it\u2019s a three-hour train journey, then about an hour on the bus to the Isle of Portland, then a marathon climb, rising nearly 500ft to the imposing stone gate, built by convict labour in the 19th century. Thomas Hardy called Portland \u201cthe Gibraltar of Wessex\u201d. The view from the top of the road is magnificent. The glorious Chesil beach stretches out beneath you. The sun glistens off Weymouth bay. It was in these waters that Ben Ainslie won Olympic gold for sailing back in 2012. The whole place is full of pink staycation Brits with rubber rings and fish and chips.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2016/aug/04/how-legitimate-marriages-have-become-home-office-honey-traps\">How legitimate marriages have become Home Office honey traps | Giles Fraser | Loose canon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But James has never seen the view, not once. Despite the fact that the Verne is the highest thing for miles, the windows look out onto more walls and barbed wire. In here you could be anywhere, and nowhere. We meet in the visitors\u2019 centre. Some couples stare at each other, not knowing what to say. Others make do without privacy to touch each other as best they can. Kids scribble in their colouring books. There is a broken table-football game and a vending machine. There were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/04/suicide-attempts-uk-immigration-removal-centres-all-time-high-home-office-figures\" title=\"\">393&#xa0;recorded suicide attempts at immigration removal centres</a> in 2015, up 11% from the year before. On average, more than one a day.</p> <p>I could tell that the shy and softly spoken James was frightened by the place. Some of the inmates are considerably more boisterous than he is. Some have histories of violence. For all his time in this country, since he came here as a student, James has never troubled the law. He is ridiculously out of place in what is, to all intents and purposes, a prison. And a prison with indefinite detention. He hasn\u2019t been sleeping well, he&#xa0;says, but the guards are nice.</p> <p>I find visiting difficult and am not always very good at it. When in hospital myself, I generally hate people coming to see me, staying too long, inventing small talk, me not being able to get away from them. I think I\u2019d shrivel up and die if a well-intentioned chaplain popped by for a cheery word. But the only thing worse than people coming to see you is them not coming to see you.</p> <p>James and I speak a bit about his legal case, but we could have done that on the phone (the policy is to take away their mobile phones and replace them with the prison\u2019s own, which do not have in-built cameras). I agree to post surety for him when he goes to court. We discuss the wedding plans \u2013 what a place to be choosing hymns. At least it doesn\u2019t look like he is being bundled onto a plane, thank God. We have a hug.</p> <p>The real challenge with visiting is having the antennae sensitive enough to pick up what the other person wants from you. Sometimes they want an emissary from home with a bit of gentle gossip. Sometimes they want that conversation everyone has been avoiding. Sometimes they want another person to pray with. It can feel very exposed going to see someone empty handed, without particular things to discuss. But mostly, people just want someone else to be there, listening, giving a damn. That easy. That hard.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/giles_fraser\" title=\"\">@giles_fraser</a></p>",

Los Angeles Times sports columnist Bill Plaschke spoke for a certain segment of the Olympic-watching public <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/la-sp-oly-national-anthem-plaschke-20160810-snap-story.html\">when he said on Wednesday</a>, \u201cThe next time Gabby Douglas stands on a podium for the national anthem, she can forget the words, disagree with them, protest them.

Of course, that is patently absurd, especially when considering that the athlete in question is an African American woman \u2014 a rough demographic to be in if you want our most outwardly patriotic citizens to respect you. Plaschke points to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/oct/14/olympicsandthemedia-athletics\">John Carlos and Tommie Smith</a>, Olympians who became infamous for raising gloved black power fists at the 1968 Games in Mexico City. If only Douglas had offered such a \u201cworthy explanation,\u201d as Plaschke puts it, for her podium behavior, she\u2019d get a pass from the imaginary monoculture that deems behavior appropriate or inappropriate. </p> <p>But would she? Today, Carlos and Smith are seen as ahead of their time and politically progressive by those on the left. But in 1968, an article in <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900397,00.html\">Time magazine described</a> their protest as a \u201cpublic display of petulance\u201d that \u201cturned the high drama of the games into theater of the absurd.\u201d I dare say that the modern party of Trump would classify similar behavior in 2016 similarly or worse.</p> <p>It\u2019s not surprising to me that someone of Plaschke\u2019s age would harken back to days of yore to spin tales of \u201chow it should be done,\u201d ignoring the very real response such actions received in their time.

The most common conviction was for drunk driving, followed by miscellaneous assaults and simple traffic offenses.</p> \n<p>This comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) claims it has narrowed the criteria it used under a started in 2008 called Secure Communities that contributed to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/23/democrats-call-on-obama-to-end-deportation-raids-on-women-and-children\">record number of deportations under Barack Obama</a>. Under the program, federal officials ask local jails to hold undocumented immigrants they arrest in custody so that they can be transferred to federal immigration detention centers. </p> \n<p>In November 2014, Homeland Security director Jeh Johnson said a new program called the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) would focus on \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d convicted of felonies or several misdemeanor offenses. In fact, the most recent data shows ICE now targets people with no criminal record at a slightly higher rate than before.</p> \n<p>ICE said it could not comment on an analysis performed by an external organization. But spokeswoman Sarah Rodriquez said the agency \u201ccontinues to make significant strides \u2026 through PEP to ensure a common-sense approach that focuses enforcement resources on convicted criminals and individuals who threaten public safety and national security\u201d.</p> \n<p>The agency says it also tries to consider \u201cimportant community policing needs\u201d. But here too, it may be be falling short. </p> \n<p>\u201cThe policies they are implementing are not keeping anyone secure,\u201d said Maria Sotomayor, an undocumented immigrant who lives in Philadelphia, and who met with Johnson in May when he tried unsuccessfully to convince the city to implement the PEP program, which would have ended its \u201csanctuary city\u201d policy that keeps ICE and police separate. </p> \n<p>\u201cI told him that because of these detainers, an immigrant who is a victim of a crime will think many times before calling the police to make a report because we could get picked up too,\u201d recalled Sotomayor.</p> \n<p>Before PEP was officially implemented last year, at least 377 local law enforcement agencies were refusing to honor some or all requests to hold immigrants in detention from ICE. The agency says 17 of the 25 jurisdictions with the highest number of declined detainers are now participating in the program.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5a66255a-cc79-416b-9f19-99ad578f5f5a\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   -\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Meanwhile, immigration advocates have sued to obtain more details how the PEP program actually differs from its predecessor. </p> \n<p>\u201cWe suspect this PEP program was just a name change,\u201d said Jessica Bansel, legal director of the National Day Laborers Organizing Network. </p> \n<p>For example, while ICE can now ask local jails to simply inform them when an immigrant is in custody, not to detain them, Bansel noted the agency also has two new detainer forms that are specifically designed to request custody of a person who recently entered the country illegally, but has not been convicted of a crime and is not a security risk. </p> \n<p>\u201cThis sort of makes the whole thing a joke,\u201d said Bansel.</p>",

Inadvertently, it has also created a huge obstacle to animals freely moving across the border in a wildlife rich corner of Europe.</p> <p>But even though the human migration crisis has dramatically eased, Slovenia\u2019s interior ministry is seeking a change in the law to prevent environmental factors from slowing the barrier\u2019s extension.</p> <p> A government spokesperson said that while refugee numbers were falling, \u201cthere are still more than 57,000 migrants in Greece. The situation in Turkey remains very uncertain after the military coup. There is a political crisis in Macedonia, and an increasing number of migrants are gathering in Serbia, which lacks sufficient accommodation capacities. Also, the number of people travelling the migrant route across the Mediterranean to Italy has increased again.\u201d</p> <p>While the fence is supposed to be a temporary measure, fears that the crisis could be prolonged were heightened when the government <a href=\"http://svet24.si/clanek/novice/slovenija/56b907d375320/razkrivami-vlada-tajno-kopici-nove-zaloge-rezilne-zice\">signalled its intent</a> to fence its entire 670km border with Croatia in December. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/migrant_fence_construction/giv-31075nIzY9ZYGDh2C/\" data-alt=\"Border fence location\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/migrant_fence_construction/giv-31075nIzY9ZYGDh2C/\">Border fence location</a> </figure>  <p> Researchers from the University of Ljubljana report of several tonnes of razor wire being stockpiled in the open at military barracks near the Croatian border, ready to be unfurled at short notice. </p> <p>Its deployment could be fast-tracked by an amendment to the state border control law that is currently being debated. The proposal, which the Guardian has seen, would exempt fence-related construction from \u201cregulations governing environmental protection, nature conservation, and water\u201d. </p> <p> With Turkey <a href=\"http://m.dw.com/en/turkey-out-of-migrant-deal-if-eu-fails-on-visa-free-travel-cavusoglu/a-19440628\">threatening to rip up a refugee deal with the EU</a> that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/19/turkish-border-guards-kill-eight-syrian-refugees-reports\">relocated the refugees crisis</a> within its borders, alarm bells are ringing in university faculties around the Balkans. </p> <p> Geographical isolation would throw the continued survival of the region\u2019s 10 wolf packs into doubt, disrupting centuries-old mating migration routes, according to a <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002483\">peer-reviewed paper</a> published in the journal PLOS Biology.</p> <p> Other carnivores could fare even worse. \u201cFor the Dinaric lynx, the construction of the razor wire fence may just be the last push for the population to spiral down the extinction vortex,\u201d the study\u2019s authors said.</p> <p> The mountain cat was only reintroduced to the Dinaric mountain chain in 1973, after human activity wiped it out. </p> <p> Most of the animals killed by the razor wire so far have been roe and red deer, but it is yet to reach key forest areas. Stretches of the barrier are already covered by vegetation or seasonally submerged by the 292 km-long Kolpa river, which straddles the two countries\u2019 border.</p> <p> Many of the deer are thought to have strayed into the fence while foraging. Once snagged, they propel themselves further into the concertina wire in a bid to escape, only tangling themselves further before eventually dying from blood loss, or exhaustion. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19dad072edfb341f038bd1e5e375608eaf250d34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19dad072edfb341f038bd1e5e375608eaf250d34/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dead deer on a campsite in Radenci in Slovenia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dead deer snagged on the fence in Radenci in Slovenia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Martin Lindic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Zrinka Domazetovi\u0107, head of biodiversity in Croatia\u2019s environment ministry, said that: \u201cwhen an animal is tangled in wire, you see it right away. Other impacts, which can have an even more detrimental impact on wildlife, cannot be so easily seen.\u201d</p> <p> Conservation scientists say that the greatest threat to wildlife comes from two-metre-high panel fences which are increasingly being used along the barrier\u2019s route to mollify public opposition to the razor wire.</p> <p>New and as yet unpublished research by Slaven Reljic, one of the PLOS Biology paper\u2019s authors, suggests that hemming in the region\u2019s 1,500 bears for longer than a decade would assure their irreversible decline.</p> <p>\u201cIn Croatia the annual bear-hunting quota is set at 10-15% [of the entire population] and in Slovenia it can reach almost 20%,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the two populations are closed in, neither will be sustainable.\u201d</p> <p>The picture is further darkened by a \u201ctrophy-hunting\u201d trend towards killing the largest bears \u2013 older males which command the highest prices. That results in a disruptive competition between juvenile bears which struggle to take their place, Reljic says.</p> <p>But hunters\u2019 associations in both countries may play an important role in conserving the bear populations they depend upon, according to regional academics. As well as monitoring the animals, many hunters detain poachers, build gates in the border fence and even lure animals back from the razor wire with food dispersals.</p> <p>This is vital work because, as Domazetovi\u0107 puts it, \u201cbears and wolves don\u2019t understand political borders\u201d. One collared bear, named after Slaven Reljic, crossed the national boundary three times last year in a six month period.</p> <p></p> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3b9f6802369b084138fbce4f149d9835c24da6b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b9f6802369b084138fbce4f149d9835c24da6b5/0_307_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zdenka \u0160tucin, a judge from Ljubljana who opposes the fence\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zdenka \u0160tucin, a judge from Ljubljana who opposes the fence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arthur Neslen/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hostility to the fence is widespread in the Upper Kolpa valley where the rampart snakes through.

It is peppered with gaping holes and absent tracts, where the fence is not yet built, or already removed by public opposition. </p> <p> \u201cThe barrier was just a psychological trick to signal to our Croatian partners that something was being done,\u201d said Dr Bo\u0161tjan Pokorny, an assistant professor at Slovenia\u2019s national forestry institute.</p> <p> Local theories explain it as a riposte to <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/tiny-slovenia-struggles-with-new-role-in-refugee-crisis-1.2399328\">Croatian mass transfer of refugees</a> in 2015, or a Slovenian bid to create a defacto southern border for the EU, <a href=\"http://www.total-croatia-news.com/item/12791-croatia-hopes-to-enter-schengen-area-after-2018\">two years before Croatia joins the Schengen club</a>. </p> <p>A Croatian government spokesman said the barrier was a \u201cpanic reaction\u201d by Slovenia that had caused \u201cgreat damage\u201d to political relations and local livelihoods.</p> <p>\u201cFor the wild animals with habitats in the border area, this razor wire is an impassable obstacle which causes many of them to be mortally hurt every day,\u201d the official told the Guardian. \u201cIf the fence lasts for 10 years or more, the long-term negative effects will be seen in the worsening genetic codes of the animals.\u201d</p> <p> The upper Kolpa valley was scarcely affected by last year\u2019s refugee flows, and many Croats instinctively feel sympathy for the refugees, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/24/world/yugoslav-refugee-crisis-europe-s-worst-since-40-s.html\">having faced a similar plight within living memory</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ccada8750a25b6b11e40c8ef1f14c1be7b8b1f95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccada8750a25b6b11e40c8ef1f14c1be7b8b1f95/0_0_3500_2403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A migrant carries a child as they continue their journey in Dobova, Slovenia October 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A migrant carries a child as they continue their journey in Dobova, Slovenia October 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Srdjan Zivulovic/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe refugee crisis was a personal affair for me as I was a refugee myself during the war in Croatia,\u201d said Aleksandra Majic, who manages the University of Ljubljana\u2019s bear and wolf conservation projects. As a high-school student, she was evacuated during the Balkan wars, first to Zagreb and then to Canada.</p> <p> \u201cI have to actively forget about my beliefs of how people should be treated because I want to be seen as objective when we talk about this fence\u2019s effect on wildlife,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is a huge challenge.\u201d</p> <p> One of the fence\u2019s few vocal supporters in the Upper Kolpa valley cited the police capture of a group of Syrian migrants in nearby Osilnica the day before. Peter Madronic, a young campsite worker, said the refugees were too \u201cculturally different\u201d from Croats to be integrated.</p> <p> \u201cMost people think that the fence is useless or senseless but I have a lot of contact with the police and they told me that migrants trying to cross the border here can be returned if we have a fence,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout it, they cannot.\u201d</p> <p>Another Croatian campsite owner, Martin Lindi\u0107, whose land in Radenci borders the fence, said that the structure was absurd, as humans could bypass it by crossing a local bridge.</p> <p> \u201cWhen the military forces came here and began fixing the fence, it felt like some kind of military occupation was starting,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople got organised and we cut the concertina wire during a demonstration against the fence.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"86c2042977b458dd8324c52125cbb67e4135779c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86c2042977b458dd8324c52125cbb67e4135779c/240_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A deer that had been caught in the fence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A deer that had been caught in the fence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Martin Lindic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The authorities removed sections of the razor wire in the protest\u2019s aftermath. More fencing was removed after a Croatian complaint to Brussels that it breached the birds and habitats directive.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the European commission said that the Slovenian government\u2019s activities were being \u201cmonitored closely\u201d. A European court case could follow. </p> <p>Since the days of the former Yugoslavia, the beautiful hilly landscape has been a popular tourist site for rafting, canoeing, kayaking and fishing. Dragan Arih, a ranger in Croatia\u2019s Risnjak national park, said that extending the barrier to his forest would be \u201cterrible, awful, catastrophic\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cThe animal migrations would be stopped and when the Kolpa floods \u2013 as it did last year \u2013 the wire would be claimed by the river and then you have another problem for the fish \u2013 and for the tourists.\u201d</p> <p> The president of the Fara tourist authority, Dr Stanko Nikolic, an 85-year-old physician from Belgrade who moved to Slovenia half a century ago, said that there had been a 50% decline in regional tourism revenues since the wall was built.</p> <p> The valley was once a borderless frontier for rural Croats and Slovenes who felt more in common with each other than with their capital cities.</p> <p> \u201cThere are still a lot of contacts between people on both sides of the river,\u201d Nikolic said. \u201cThey want to remove this \u2018temporary\u2019 fence. If it becomes permanent, I\u2019m afraid that our common life will collapse into two fragments.\u201d</p> <p> The fence had already caused the deaths of \u201cseveral dozens\u201d of local animals, he added. Such estimates though, are contested. A new survey by the Slovenian hunting association, the Slovenian government\u2019s accredited monitor, will say that only around 15 animals, have died on the wire so far, mostly red deer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56017eac1586e6328600a7c03696609d163fa36d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56017eac1586e6328600a7c03696609d163fa36d/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Croatian and Slovenian people protest against the border fence in December 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Croatian and Slovenian people protest against the border fence in December 2015.

Igor Barbara, secretary of the Croatian hunting lodge, said that seven red deer had been killed in the 10km stretch of fence bordering his hunting ground alone. He had found others with razor lacerations, floating dead in the river.</p> <p> Lindi\u0107 cited another 10 deer killed on his small section of the barrier. He also claimed to have seen several retreats by animals which had become enmeshed in razor snarls. A bear had also been entangled before escaping, he said. </p> <p> \u201cI think that about 100 animals have died from entanglement on the fence,\u201d Lindi\u0107 told the Guardian.</p>",

He said: \u201cYes, you will see some price increases but in the last three years you didn\u2019t see price increases.\u201d</p> <p>Joussen noted that 60% of holidays sold in Britain were packages.</p> <p>Tui has sold 89% of its summer holidays in the UK, beating last year\u2019s figures.

Sales dropped 5.7% to \u20ac4.6bn, as demand dropped following the attempted coup and terrorist attacks in Turkey and a spate of other attacks in Europe.</p> <p>Like its rival Thomas Cook, Tui has switched holiday packages from the eastern to the western Mediterranean. Joussen said about 2 million customers had altered their travel plans, with bookings to Turkey down 40%. Egypt has also suffered while UK tour operators stopped offering package holidays to Tunisia for summer 2016.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you have a lot of incidents, that affects the industry,\u201d Joussen said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a rollercoaster, up and down,\u201d pointing to the failed coup attempt in Turkey and attacks in Nice, Paris and Brussels. However, he insisted that people were still travelling, albeit to other destinations.</p> <p>He was confident that customer numbers would be up from last year, and that Tui was on track to deliver at least 10% growth in underlying EBITA this year. Tui launched two cruise ships this summer and opened five hotels, with a further cruise ship due to join its UK fleet next summer.</p> <p>Thomas Cook has been hit more by the slump in travel to Turkey. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/thomas-cook-profit-warning-terror-attacks-turkey-egypt-tunisia\">The company lowered its full-year profit forecast</a> last month, when it revealed a \u00a325m pretax loss on operations in the three months to June.</p>",

The solenodon is a rabbit-sized, shrew-like mammal that is only found on two Caribbean islands: Cuba and Hispaniola (the Dominican Republic and Haiti). </p> <p>There are a whole slew of reasons why the solenodon\u2019s star should rise, including the facts that it\u2019s one of the only venomous mammals and David Attenborough really <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/nov/10/attenboroughs-ark-tv-review\">likes it</a>. But, most of all, the solenodon should be famous because it somehow survived the asteroid collision that killed off the dinosaurs, not to mention the next 66 million years of other catastrophes, from Ice Ages to the rise of bipedal destroyers named Homo Sapiens. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s truly remarkable that the solenodons survived this direct hit, whilst global ecosystems collapsed around them.</p> <footer> <cite>Samuel Turvey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe solenodon lineage diverged from other placental mammals circa 78 million years ago. That means [it] has existed since the Cretaceous period,\u201d said Adam Brandt, lead author of a recent study that took the first look at the solenodon\u2019s mitochondrial DNA. </p> <p>But Brandt\u2019s research was actually the third study to find that solendons very likely scuttled under the feet of dinosaurs.</p> <p>\u201cWe can be fairly confident because each of these studies have utilized different genes and phylogenetic analysis methods,\u201d Brandt said, noting that with each study the \u201cresult becomes increasingly reliable.\u201d </p> <p>Researchers aren\u2019t entirely sure where the various solenodon populations were located when the asteroid hit \u2013 whether they were already on the landmasses that would become modern-day Cuba and Hispaniola or on the mainland \u2013 but they think the populations were close to ground zero of the asteroid\u2019s impact in Chicxulub, Mexico. </p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s truly remarkable that the solenodons survived this direct hit, whilst global ecosystems collapsed around them \u2013 we have no idea how they did it,\u201d Samuel Turvey, an expert on modern day extinctions and a Senior Research Fellow with the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), said.</p> <h2>Hello, Solenodon</h2> <p>There is really nothing on the planet like the solenodon. There are just two surviving species today, one found on Cuba and the other, more well known, on Hispaniola. But these two species alone are so distinct from any other mammal that they represent an entire biological family: Solenodontidae. To put that in perspective every single species of mice and rat \u2013 from the African pygmy mouse to the Northern Luzon giant cloud rat \u2013 also represent a single family of 700-plus species. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"159fde3ec1c5c39913f139f44e7f2e4a8e16d9f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/159fde3ec1c5c39913f139f44e7f2e4a8e16d9f5/63_130_1955_1172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Hispaniolan solenodon is caught on camera trap leaving its burrow at night in the Dominican Republic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Hispaniolan solenodon is caught on camera trap leaving its burrow at night in the Dominican Republic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grupo Jaragua</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Solenodons sport a number of weird attributes. They can squeeze venomous saliva out of their incisors. They have evolved a ball and socket joint in their snout to give it extra-special maneuverability. They likely use echolocation to locate prey. Their eyes are tiny, their claws are in need of a trim, and they waddle when they walk as if they\u2019d spent too much time at the pub. </p> <p>Natural History Museum geneticist, Selina Brace, who recently co-authored a paper on the Hispaniolan solenodon with Turvey, called solenodons a \u201cfabulously quirky creature\u201d and said she was \u201cinstantly hooked\u201d after seeing a picture of this oddity. </p> <p>Nocturnal mammals, solenodons live in burrows and come out at night to eat grubs and insects, probably just as they did 78 million years ago, only now they don\u2019t have to worry about being stepped on by a sauropod or waking a sleep-deprived tyrannosaur. Instead, these species must worry about having their forests chopped down by people or being eaten by a dog or a mongoose. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I cannot explain what I felt the first time I touched it.</p> <footer> <cite>Norvis Henandez</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Currently the Hispaniola solenodon is considered endangered by the IUCN Red List \u2013 though two of its subspecies may be close to extinction. The Cuban solenodon is in an even more precarious position. Also considered endangered, the species has been feared extinct more than once. The ZSL\u2019s <a href=\"http://edgeofexistence.org/index.php\">EDGE Programme</a>, which categorizes animals based on their threatened status and evolutionary distinctness, lists the pair of solenodons as number seven in the <a href=\"http://edgeofexistence.org/mammals/top_100.php\">top 100 mammals</a>. <br></p> <p>Turvey said the fact that the solenodon survived so many upheavals \u201cmakes it even more tragic that these \u2018living fossil\u2019 survivors are now in danger of extinction due to human activities.\u201d</p> <h2>Cuba\u2019s star</h2> <p>Norvis Hernandez, a Cuban biologist, is one of the few people on planet Earth who has seen a living, wild Cuban solenodon. Smaller than its Hispaniola cousin, the Cuban solenodon is easily distinguished by its black-and-white hair. </p> <p>\u201cThis experience of watching this ancient species [was] wonderful, it was for a short time because I do not like to feel that this species[was] stressed,\u201d said Hernandez who caught a female solenodon in Alejandro Humboldt National Park for brief study before releasing it again. \u201cI cannot explain what I felt the first time I touched it.\u201d</p> <p>It took Hernandez and her colleagues 12 days of searching in the field to finally catch a Cuban solenodon, known locally as the almiqui. <br></p> <p>She said that the Cuban solenodon\u2019s keen senses of smell and hearing make it almost impossible to capture with conventional methods. The species not only avoids human contact but, according to Hernandez, is never tricked by the mechanical traps scientists commonly use to catch small mammals. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/oct/20/the-four-horsemen-of-the-sixth-mass-extinction\">How humans are driving the sixth mass extinction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First described in 1861, scientist lost track of the Cuban solenodon near the end of the 19th Century. No one had saw it for almost a hundred years \u2013 and many assumed it was extinct \u2013 until researchers spotted a few in the mid-1970s. And then no one saw it again until 2003. <br></p> <p>Today, scientists have confirmed there is a small population hanging on in Alejandro Humboldt National Park. But no one knows how many or if its range extends beyond the park\u2019s borders. <br></p> <p>Hernandez, whose current work is funded through the <a href=\"http://www.speciesconservation.org/\">Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Foundation</a>, said research of this endangered species has suffered due to a lack of money, including for non-invasive observation tools like camera traps.</p> <p>\u201cI think a lot remains to be done to preserve the species,\u201d she said, adding that many local people don\u2019t even know it exists or erroneously believe it is extinct. </p> <h2>Three-in-one solenodons</h2> <p>Even as scientists try and find out basic data on the Cuban solenodon, researchers are discovering surprises regarding the better-known Hispaniolan species. Surveying the species\u2019 various populations, Samuel Turvey and his team recently discovered that the Hispaniolan species is actually three distinct subspecies. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d25c1d57c3761c145ca93f7116059d3c2c1c52c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d25c1d57c3761c145ca93f7116059d3c2c1c52c/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A female Hispaniolan solenodon caught for research near the Sierra de Bahoruco and re-released.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A female Hispaniolan solenodon caught for research near the Sierra de Bahoruco and re-released.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tiffany Roufs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201c[These] evolved as a result of local isolation in the island\u2019s geologically complex landscapes,\u201d Turvey said, who noted the subspecies can be told apart both through DNA and physical attributes. <br></p> <p>One subspecies is found in a single forest in Haiti and may be perilously close to extinction. Another is found throughout the bulk of the northern Dominican Republic, but is lesser known. The third is located across the southern Dominican mountain range \u2013 Sierra de Bahoruco \u2013 that includes several parks and is the best protected of the subspecies. </p> <p>However, the discovery complicates conservation of the species as the southern subspecies show very little genetic diversity, while the northern subspecies survives in a highly fragmented landscape. According to <a href=\"http://www.globalforestwatch.org/\">Global Forest Watch</a>, the Dominican Republic lost more than 200,000 hectares of forest between 2001 and 2014.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2ced90b7895c5251ce8fdc55e1c2d4bff60a1b87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ced90b7895c5251ce8fdc55e1c2d4bff60a1b87/0_0_1425_2138/667.jpg\" alt=\"A female Hispaniola solenodon with a radio collar attached so researchers could track its movements.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A female Hispaniola solenodon with a radio collar attached so researchers could track its movements.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tiffany Roufs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite having the largest range, Ernst Rupp, a Dominican Republic biologist with the local NGO Grupo Jaragua, said the northern subspecies \u201chas never really been investigated.\u201d However, recent surveys have proved the northern subspecies does still occurs in at least four protected areas, as well as in several areas outside protection.</p> <p>The plight of the solenodon in Haiti may be the most dire of all. Haiti\u2019s forests have been decimated over centuries and the solenodon survives only in the Massif de la Hotte region, the impoverished nation\u2019s last significant stand of cloud forest. </p> <p>\u201cThe Massif de la Hotte is a spectacular mountainous area in the far south-west of Haiti, where one of the few remnants of good quality forest in the country can be found,\u201d said Rosalind Kennerley with Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWCT). </p> <p>But, the region remains under intense pressure for the charcoal trade, which has resulted in almost total deforestation in Haiti. Even the national park \u2013 Macaya National Park \u2013 is commonly infiltrated by charcoal producers. </p> <p>Kennerley is leading a team attempting to get baseline information on the how the Haitian subspecies if faring, a project also supported by the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, which often gives grants to lesser-known species. Not only do solenodons face environment deterioration in Haiti, but locals will also kill them and eat them when they are found. </p> <h2>The perils of anonymity</h2> <p>Fame or the lack of it really does make a difference when it comes to conservation.</p> <p>In 2009, a number of conservation groups \u2013 DWCT, ZSL\u2019s the EDGE programme, La Sociedad Ornitol\u00f3gica de la Hispaniola (SOH) and the Dominican Republic\u2019s Ministry for Environment and Natural Resources \u2013 kick-started a three-year research and conservation programme on the Hispaniola solenodon called The Last Survivors (the program also included the Hispaniola hutia, a tree-dwelling rodent). While it resulted in researchers learning more about the solenodon than ever before, the conservation impacts have been negligible, according to Rupp. </p> <p>\u201c[The programme] drew a lot of international attention to the Hispaniolan solenodon,\u201d Rupp said. \u201cSome of this attention actually spilled over into the Dominican press which published a few articles on the species.\u201d </p> <p>But the press has dissipated since the program ended in 2012 after a two-day stakeholder meeting. Worse still, few of the project\u2019s conservation recommendations have come to pass. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60364986a4c6d542fd48d5e0844a93e7f1120fb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60364986a4c6d542fd48d5e0844a93e7f1120fb8/0_0_5324_3924/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An asteroid strikes Earth as flying reptiles look on.

As a result, the species will likely be downlisted by the IUCN Red List in the future. The programme\u2019s work has also led to a new focus \u2013 and concern \u2013 for the nearly extinct subspecies in Haiti. <br></p> <p>\u201cProtection of the native-forest habitat remains a priority for this species, as it is for other species on Hispaniola,\u201d Turvey said. </p> <p>But there remains little pride or even knowledge of the species in his home country, according to Rupp, despite it being one of only two endemic land mammals across the entirety of Hispaniola and the fact that it actually walked with dinosaurs.</p> <p>Sure, fame isn\u2019t everything. In fact, for human beings fame may well be <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Healthday/story?id=7658253&amp;page=1\">detrimental</a> for well-being. But for species, unfortunately, fame can mean the difference between extinction and survival. Famous species rake in far more funding and attention than the millions that live out of the limelight. While hopefully one day we\u2019ll focus more on other attributes for species conservation \u2013 extinction risk, evolutionary distinctness, or ecological roles \u2013 solenodons may not have much time, especially the Haitian subspecies and the Cuban species. </p> <p>Sure, solenodons survived the dinosaurs, the asteroid, several invasions of humans, and the arrival of novel predators \u2013 but can they survive obscurity in the Anthropocene? </p>",

These were supposed to be filled in by athletes and include anthropometric information (e.g. measurements of the body) as well as details of athletes\u2019 families, background, basic medical history, and so on.

Added to this was the sudden death of Wolffe in 1967, which seems to have put an end to the project. Although athletes were studied physiologically at the Mexico City Games, no mention was made of the OMA scheme in the official report of the Games.</p> <h2>The secrets of sporting success</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre\">tragedy at the 1972 Munich Games</a>, with the kidnap and murder of eleven members of the Israeli team, led to a tightening of security at subsequent Olympic events; this meant restrictions on the personnel that could travel with teams, and made it much harder for scientists to attend as part of a study or survey project. Distrust had always been a problem for the physiological surveys (not all countries had participated even in the yellow/blue card scheme). In 1980, although the Moscow organising committee set up a \u201cphysiological testing station\u201d, British athletes were warned via their official handbook not to attend without checking with their team doctor first. The dream of gathering data to benefit \u201cthe whole of mankind\u201d as part of a collaborative, shared, scientific project, got lost in the reality of international sports; too expensive, too time consuming, and too open.</p> <p><em>Vanessa Heggie is the author of <a href=\"http://www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/9780719091285/\">A History of British Sports Medicine</a>, published by Manchester University Press (hardback 2011, paperback 2013).</em><br></p>",

Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant terrorist viewed as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/10/how-isis-crippled-al-qaida\">the founder of Isis</a>, was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/08/iraq.alqaida\">killed in a US airstrike</a> in Baghdad in 2006.</p> <p>Although Isis has expanded rapidly during Obama\u2019s tenure, seizing in particular on the Syrian civil war, the administration has also made gains in its military campaign against the extremist group. US army lieutenant general Sean MacFarland said on Wednesday an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/isis-ranks-dwindle-to-15000-amid-retreat-on-all-fronts-claims-pentagon\">estimated 45,000 fighters</a> linked to Isis had been killed in the two years since the US-led military coalition against the network was launched. </p> <p>Trump has not articulated a clear strategy against Isis, other than to threaten a ruthless bombing campaign and continuously push his proposal to ban Muslim immigration from the US. </p> <p>He has also seized on recent terrorist attacks to revive conspiracies about Obama\u2019s birthplace and religion. <br></p> <p>Immediately after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/18/orlando-nightlcub-shooting-pulse-florida-attack-timeline\">12 June mass shooting</a> at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which left 49 dead and 53 more injured, Trump said Obama \u201cdoesn\u2019t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands\u201d. <br></p> <p>In addition to insinuating that Obama, a Christian, is secretly a Muslim, Trump has also falsely stated the president was born in Kenya when he was, in fact, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/27/barack-obama-birth-certificate-released\">born in Hawaii.</a></p>",

Which leads us to the evening\u2019s main event: Brazil v Denmark.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s been desperate stuff so far from the hosts: two draws and no goals from their first two matches (against Iraq and South Africa) and the team\u2019s captain and star Neymar looking a shadow of the player who has been thrilling fans in Europe with Barcelona. After the humiliation of the Sele\u00e7ao\u2019s 7-1 thrashing by Germany in the World Cup semi-final two years ago, this was meant to be a chance to restore some pride in the national team. Amazingly, Brazil are still in second place in Group A but a much-improved performance will be required against Denmark in Salvador to guarantee progress to the quarter-finals, with South Africa facing Iraq in S\u00e3o Paulo.</p> <p>Nothing can be taken for granted, though.

Let that sentence sink in. Let it envelop you like Matthew Dellavedova\u2019s spider-limbs as he tries to chew on your face, remove the ball from your hands and throw up an alley-oop at the same time. The Boomers lost by 10 points as things dissolved late, yes. But they let the NBA all-stars know that if they\u2019re able to leverage this undeniable team spirit and manic intensity into a gold medal game appearance, it\u2019s going to be a bar fight.</p> <p>There will be joyless individuals out there who tell you that even this was only possible because the US team arrived without the three best players in the world and just had an off night. Those same people will also probably scold you for playing Pokemon Go and enjoying Fast and Furious films. But how about this: this US team <em>does</em> have 12 of the best 15 players in the world. Australia have a guy who played for the West Sydney Razorbacks. They also have David Anderson, who might actually be 57 years old. Nobody is sure.<br></p> <p>To witness the Boomers match it with the best today was to watch Frankston\u2019s own Ryan Broekhoff being professionally fouled by NBA star DeAndre Jordan. He had to. Australia had a run on. Andrew Bogut comes from Endeavour Hills, Matthew Dellevedova from Maryborough \u2013 towns where the local McDonalds is the hub of social activity for kids. Once they were places where childhood sporting dreams simply didn\u2019t flourish into brain-rattling moments like this. Now, they\u2019re places where kids are saying, \u201che\u2019s doing it, why the hell can\u2019t I?\u201d Six Australians have now won NBA championship rings. Australian basketball had already arrived, but today it put its feet up on the desk and eyeballed Team USA. It\u2019s almost enough to make you tear up. </p> <p>At the conclusion of the game, Australian star Andrew Bogut stops by for a few terse words. \u201cWe still lost the game, it doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d he says bluntly. \u201cThere\u2019s no small victories.\u201d <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-11T00:02:26.229Z\">at 1.02am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57abbefbe4b0f231200d9b64\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T23:57:39.317Z\">12.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sun flare-up spoils Instagram posts! \u2013 or something like that.

It is pure focus with no shred of strain \u2013 a moment seized from the jaws of gravity.</p> <p>I watch this with the prickle of envy and excitement of a former gymnast (though hardly one who was a threat to Soviet-bloc dominance in my day). When I was bashing away at free cartwheels and back-flips, gymnastics was undergoing radical change from the rise of the elfin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jul/06/50-stunning-olympic-moments-olga-korbut\">Olga Korbut</a> at the Munich games in 1972 and the classicism of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMsWKy5CbJA\">Ludmilla Tourischeva</a>.

Just as the \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_crisis\">Sputnik shock</a>\u201d in the space race had earlier spurred the US\u2019s technological advancement, the other sports superpower was galvanised to produce a stream of winners. Paradoxically, the US star-makers hailed from the heart of the old eastern bloc: B\u00e9la and M\u00e1rta K\u00e1rolyi, Com\u0103neci\u2019s coaches from Romania, have trained a string of American gold medallists since the Atlanta breakthrough of 1996. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sSuTdsjxTI\">Mary Lou Retton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwa5Bf656As\">Kerri Strug</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Gabby+Douglas&amp;oq=Gabby+Douglas&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.443j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#mie=oly%2C%5B%22%2Fm%2F0h64f0w%22%2C2%2C%22o%22%2C1%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2C0%5D\">Gabby Douglas</a> \u2013 all were tough get-outta-my-way girls with fire and drive. Biles is the natural progression to an outlier.</p> <p>Some things have been gained and some lost along the way. The focus on hair and glittery makeup for women, such as Biles\u2019s Swarovski <a href=\"http://www.refinery29.com/2016/08/118932/simone-biles-gymnastics-leotard-olympics-2016\">crystal-strewn leotard</a>. Routines now are punishing, super-fast accumulations of elements to pounding music.</p> <p>The Biles back story is an uplifting tale of a fostered child brought up in modest circumstances by a grandfather who indulged her drive to succeed. In terms of her impact on the sport, she represents something else: a return of the quest for perfection.</p> <p>This is the aspect that lifts gymnastics from the sweaty floormats into the philosophical \u2013 the search for the perfect routine, balanced between artistry and athletic achievement. In athletics, the four-minute mile and the 10-second 100 metres sprint were once the equivalent ultimate goals. In clock-timed sports, the difference of a split second makes scoring easier. Ice-skating allows for individual differences between judges (older readers will remember the East German judge jokes for giving low scores to any other nations). Gymnastics aggregates scores between the judges on two separate panels to come to final result, often with a fair bit of arguing.</p> <p>But once the perfect 10 had been granted to Com\u0103neci in 1976, others followed, so what could supersede it? Attempts to resolve this drew the sport\u2019s authorities into a madly overcomplicated scoring system of minuscule decimal differences.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/03/simone-biles-gymnastics-america-rio-2016\">The extraordinary Simone Biles, the best athlete in America today</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m kinda hoping one falls over so I can work out who\u2019s lost,\u201d muttered the man behind me at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012\">London Olympics</a>. One helpful commentary on the \u201ccode of points\u201d seeks to sort out the ratings for difficulty thus: \u201cThere is now an \u2018H\u2019 value for a skill being worth eight tenths. The double double tuck is an \u201cH\u201d skill. There is also 0.3CV (difficulty rating for a linking move).\u201d For example a C + E (Double salto) indirect will give a gymnast 0.3CV</p> <p>Biles has cut through this arcane muddle by being so much better than the pack that she is regarded in the same way that athletes regard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/09/samba-dancing-usain-bolt-says-hes-relaxed-before-olympic-showdown-video\">Usain Bolt</a> or tennis player <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/26/tennis-rio-olympic-games-roger-federer-out-knee-injury\">Roger Federer</a> at his peak. Other participants joke that the only competition is for second place, so obviously superior is Biles. Her 15.933 on the vault in effect makes a 16 score the new 10. Where does this new leap forward leave the old perfection quest? It always was a glorious impossibility \u2013 human movement is never without flaws, even at its peak.</p> <p>Pedants will do the same for Biles, or search for the missing .067 points. But the complexity of her routines and the sheer reliability of her results banishes quibbles. As in the days of Com\u0103neci, you will hear people say that there are only so many twisting turns and revolutions that a body is capable of in space and time, however concentrated the training. (Biles has a gym routine that would have exhausted Mike Tyson, leaving legs so sore they are treated with a suit of compressed air.)</p> <p>I\u2019m not convinced of these limits, for the same reason that human progress is so often underestimated. That is why the perfect 10 is now de facto the perfect 16, and before I have done my last wobbly handstand in the garden, it will be something else and something more. Such is the enchanted essence of gymnastics. It gets closer and closer to something perfect \u2013 just before perfect moves on again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/marathon-promo-full/\" data-alt=\"RioRun\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/marathon-promo-full/\">RioRun</a> </figure>",

Regular monitoring is not possible in a vast country that lacks an authority responsible for coordinating data from the centre and states; the nature, frequency and extent of causes of internal displacement in India are so varied that it would be a herculean task to record them; and political sensitivities at state level prevent the release of information on the exact nature and extent of displacement.</p> <p>\u201cI cannot access government programmes like [the] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/05/india-rural-employment-funding-cuts-mgnrega\">rural employment guarantee scheme</a> because I don\u2019t have any government identity documents,\u201d says Deva. \u201cSo I work in brick kilns or the construction sector and get half of what locals are paid.

  "<p>When Guardian Australia launched, just over three years ago, we decided to put the country\u2019s immigration system at the heart of our coverage.

  "<p>There is no accounting for taste, but here\u2019s a grumpy man\u2019s guide to the food you are probably seeing a lot of on Instagram.</p> <h2><strong>1. Gourmet doughnuts</strong></h2> <p>I could forgive the silly flavours, the exorbitant prices and the tendency to stuff them full of inedible amounts of caramel, but gourmet doughnuts\u2019 greatest crime is their willful blindness to the fact that a deep-fried doughnut is best when freshly cooked. Letting them sit out for hours to go stale, sweat and weep sugar before an Instagrammer decides to throw their cash away is not doing them any favours. I\u2019ve never had a fancy, gourmet, eight-dollar doughnut that could hold a candle to an old-fashioned freshly cooked cinnamon-and-sugar number.</p> <h2><strong>2. Korean fried chicken</strong></h2> <p>Over the past decade, Korean fried chicken has taken the world by storm and I could not be more baffled. Every time I\u2019ve tried it \u2013 even in Korea \u2013 it\u2019s tasted cloyingly sweet and over-battered, like something out of a bad Chinese buffet bain-marie. It\u2019s not awful, but neither is it worth the hype.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/oct/15/adam-liaw-five-simple-dishes-and-the-mistakes-youre-making-with-them\">Adam Liaw: five simple dishes, and the mistakes you\u2019re making with them</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>3. Chocolate cake</strong></h2> <p>Chocolate cake is what you get if you start with a delicious block of chocolate and take away all the good parts \u2013 the sharp crack as you bite into it, the satin texture as it melts in your mouth and the bittersweet creaminess it leaves behind. Ninety per cent of chocolate cakes are dry and crumbly, and those that aren\u2019t are either overwhelmed with butter or undercooked to the point of raw flour. Just because you like something doesn\u2019t mean you should make a cake out of it.</p> <h2><strong>4. Barbecue brisket</strong></h2> <p>Here\u2019s a tip for barbecue goers \u2013 don\u2019t rave about the brisket at a particular restaurant just because you think that brisket is what \u2019cue professionals rave about. The reason the quality of the brisket is considered the make-or-break of a good barbecue is that it\u2019s dry and ropey more often than not. Chances are the gastro pub, faux-barbecue brisket you\u2019re raving about is the former.</p> <h2><strong>5. \u2018Cool\u2019 Tacos</strong></h2> <p>The western world owes Mexico an enormous apology for everything it has done to tacos over the past 80 years. The hard-shelled abominations of the 20th century, stuffed with minced beef, jarred salsa, processed cheese and wilted lettuce may be excused as the follies of not knowing any better, but instead of righting our wrongs we doubled down, creating a suite of uniformly terrible modern tacos that are now everywhere from hipster bistros in Portland to pubs in outback Australia. Half-hearted pulled pork with sickly sweet pineapple salsa? Deep-fried fish with mango? A few strips of sad \u201ccarne asada\u201d with avocado, the wonder drug of the western middle-class? Mexico, we are sorry.</p> <h2><strong>6. Authentic Peking duck</strong></h2> <p>To really experience authentic Peking duck, you\u2019ve got to head to China, and you\u2019ve also got to prepare to be sorely disappointed. It all starts with glassy shards of near-tasteless but potato-chip crispy duck skin dipped in sugar. YES, SUGAR. Maybe 800 years ago this might have been considered a rare treat, like the Tudors eating their jellied peacocks, but food has evolved a lot since then. Modern Peking duck that skips the sugar debacle and jumps straight to pancakes of meat and flavourful skin together is definitely an improvement. Authentic is not always best.</p> <h2><strong>7. Every \u2018famous\u2019 sandwich</strong></h2> <p>If you\u2019ve ever been to New York, there\u2019s a decent chance that you\u2019ve been to Katz\u2019s Deli for the authentic New York experience of lining up 10-deep with a hundred other tourists for the Reuben sandwich from the film When Harry Met Sally. Maybe you raved about it to your friends. Maybe you complained about it on TripAdvisor. Either way, secretly inside you were probably a little disappointed it was just an ordinary sandwich. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s bad, but the US has a track record of turning pretty boring foods into icons. If you don\u2019t believe me, just ask any American about \u201cgrilled cheese\u201d (hint: it\u2019s two pieces of bread with cheese in the middle).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/sep/30/adam-liaws-10-dishes-you-should-be-able-to-cook-by-the-time-youre-30\">Adam Liaw's 10 dishes you should be able to cook by the time you\u2019re 30</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>8. Bircher muesli</strong></h2> <p>How did soggy muesli ever become a thing? Pouring fruit juice all over your muesli sounds more like a terrible accident than a recipe. Part of Bircher muesli\u2019s appeal is its history as a health food, but then again that\u2019s how corn flakes got started. I\u2019m not sure nutritionists today would agree with the many recipes for Bircher muesli that involve spiking your grains with enough sugary juice to increase the calorie content of a single bowl to around the same as eating a cheeseburger.</p> <h2><strong>9. Bacon</strong></h2> <p>There is no doubt bacon is delicious, if you\u2019re into that sort of thing, but to hear some people bang on about it you\u2019d think Jesus was born wrapped in it. None of us are immune to the appeal of marketing but follow the cultural deification of bacon alongside a graph of the money that was able to be made on pork belly commodity markets from the 1960s to the 90s and you might conclude that your love for bacon is driven more by Wall Street wallets than the tastebuds on your tongue.</p>",

But days later, when he failed to wake up in intensive care, and the ventilator was turned off, there was no end to my self-reproach and moral distress, which grew worse when the thoughtful surgeon said he would never have gone ahead if I\u2019d flagged the problem. </p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d he rued.</p> <p>I later wrote about the experience in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1212410\">New England Journal of Medicine</a> and something interesting happened when the piece was published. Doctors wrote in from all over the world, sharing their own stories, and thanking me for \u201ccourageously\u201d illuminating an issue that also nagged at them. But since the essay was widely circulated, many non-doctors read it too and their response could be summarised by the excoriating words of one correspondent: \u201cYou were gutless to not speak up for your patient and I would never, ever want someone like you as my doctor.\u201d</p> <p>This stinging (and I thought, deserved) rebuke highlighted the extraordinary gap between how doctors and patients perceive the same set of events. And I couldn\u2019t help but think of this as I read the damning reports of errors that recently came to light within the New South Wales public hospital system. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/25/baby-dies-and-another-critical-after-they-were-given-nitrous-oxide-at-sydney-hospital\">One baby died and another suffered serious brain damage</a> when nitrous oxide, instead of oxygen, was administered at birth.

From arrival to discharge, the average patient encounters a march-past of doctors, each responsible for a tiny fraction of care. How to tell the difference between honesty and evasion? How to gauge if one is receiving adequate care?</p> <p>Most hospitalised patients have no idea whose care they are under; frustratingly, their doctors may not know either. Increasingly, in modern medicine, there is no such thing as the patient\u2019s doctor \u2013 it\u2019s the patient\u2019s pulmonologist, oncologist, thoracic surgeon, psychiatrist and cardiologist. This fragmentation of care has deep consequences for decision-making and healthcare spending but there is another growing problem \u2013 the diffusion of accountability.</p> <p>If you are one of five doctors tending a patient, it can be tricky to specify your personal responsibility.</p> <p>If the person\u2019s cancer is in remission but she has persistent abdominal pain, how much should you intervene? None, according to the gastroenterologist who told me to mind my own business until I could see a cancer on the scan. Imagine you are the infectious diseases consultant called to give an opinion on a last-ditch antibiotic for a transplant patient and the patient\u2019s son correctly fears that his father is dying but no one will tell him. What should you do? Counsel the son, find the transplant physician, or just chart the drug, when past experience tells you that your role is viewed as antibiotic selection, not patient prognostication?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hospitals ... should celebrate doctors who model outstanding behaviour and demonstrate personal integrity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is by now a familiar array of reasons given for the mismatch between what the public expects and what doctors deliver. It appears that in New South Wales, like in other places, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/26/i-wasnt-surprised-by-four-corners-bullying-in-medicine-is-as-old-as-the-profession\">bullying is endemic</a>, hierarchies persist, and those who speak up risk losing not just their sleep but possibly their livelihood.</p> <p>Witnessing such incidents disheartens doctors who feel that their diligent work is undone by poor institutional culture. They are particularly detrimental to medical students and young doctors who imbibe the message that their ethical actions won\u2019t budge the status quo.</p> <p>We drill into all doctors the idea of professional integrity \u2013 behaving in accordance with the norms of a hallowed profession. At corporate-style workshops held at enormous cost, institutions love to posit, \u201cWhat kind of doctor do we want you to be?\u201d </p> <p>Implicit in this question is the message that a doctor\u2019s conduct can be shaped by institutional expectation. So being a certain kind of doctor, say the kind that is a \u201cteam player\u201d, or a \u201cconsensus builder\u201d, you might avoid the bumps. But as countless unfortunate incidents show, a smooth, uncontroversial career for a doctor has little bearing on patient outcomes. Doctors whose highest aim is to keep the executive happy have different goals to the ones whose duty is to patients.</p> <p>So, while professional integrity is necessary, I think the question we ought to periodically ask all doctors is actually a far simpler one. \u201cWhat kind of a <em>person </em>do you want to be?\u201d </p> <p>Implied in <em>this</em> question is an appeal to our better selves, a reminder to care about our patients as people and treat them with respect, compassion and understanding. If you see yourself as an upright, fair and considerate individual then you will treat the patient in a manner consistent with this and more importantly, do it fearlessly. After all, personal integrity does not need the imprimatur of the institution.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/10/doctors-as-an-arm-of-border-protection-thats-a-step-too-far\">Doctors as an arm of border protection?

Along the way, we grapple with fundamental beliefs about what it means to be a doctor and how we will live up to many of our own high expectations.</p> <p>In the same way as hospitals flaunt their most innovative researchers, adept surgeons and grant-winning physicians, they should celebrate doctors who model outstanding behaviour and demonstrate personal integrity because their impact is enduring.</p> <p>The imbalance of information and power in the doctor-patient relationship is enormous and the temptation to take shortcuts is human and ever-present. This is why it helps to stop and ask, \u201cWhat kind of a person do I want to be?\u201d</p> <p>Doctors lose count of the exhortations about how to be a better doctor because the institutional guidance regrettably seems like corporate advice. Patients are not clients, consumers or customers \u2013 they are people. People who are sick and afraid and vulnerable, who need doctors armed not only with skills but a sense of our shared humanity.</p> <p>Someone once told me that personal integrity is how you behave when no one else is looking.

  "<p>No matter how impressive the evidence of benefits, or how weak the evidence of serious side effects or how badly a strategy is needed, new harm reduction strategies are always greeted the same way: with relentless hostility.</p> <p>Debates about harm reduction always follow the same pattern. Hysterical fears are confidently asserted as if proven beyond doubt while potential benefits, often based on considerable research and experience, are dismissed or ignored. </p> <p>Many harm reduction interventions are eventually approved, usually too little and too late, and then turn out to be far more successful than had been hoped.

Then the opposition takes many years to slowly die away.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/02/australias-drugs-policy-led-the-world-30-years-ago-now-politics-holds-us-back\">Australia's drug policy led the world 30 years ago. Now politics holds us back | Alex Wodak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Harm reduction is usually associated with illicit drugs. But long before there was harm reduction for illicit drugs, there was already harm reduction for alcohol. Alcohol policy wonks in the 1970s used to speak of \u201cmaking the world safe for drunks\u201d. They knew that, like the poor, some hopelessly intoxicated people in public places would always be with us. The idea behind this slogan was, for example, separating drunken pedestrians from speeding traffic. Of course energetic efforts to reduce the frequency and severity of public drunkenness still continued.</p> <p>In 1970, the Victorian parliament made the wearing of seat belts compulsory for drivers and front-seat passengers, the first such legislation in the world. Concerns about the high proportion of road crashes due to drunk driving and the difficulties of reducing such deaths prompted the introduction of this legislation. Seat belt critics argued that drivers would inevitably compensate for their increased safety by just driving faster and more recklessly. Studies showed that the net reduction in crashes, deaths, serious injuries and financial savings was huge.</p> <p>As a young doctor, I quickly became converted to public health harm reduction interventions when shown a scale model of a new wing being constructed at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne in 1971. The wing had been designed before seat belt legislation had been approved and was being built after seat belts were compulsory. Many beds initially reserved for treating people with complex fractured skulls had now been made redundant and were now available for treating other conditions. I remember the vigorous debate about the introduction of car seat belts.</p> <p>Much like other harm reduction debates, the conflict continued after seat belts had been introduced, eventually dying away long after studies showed clearly the huge savings in deaths, injuries, hospital beds and health care costs.</p> <p>The idea of risk compensation runs through every debate about harm reduction. The notion is that all of us accept a certain amount of risk. If our exposure to risk is decreased, the risk compensation hypothesis suggests that we then increase our risky behaviour to return our overall risk level back to an equilibrium position. Sometimes we actually do increase an unwanted and risky behavior because of a reduced risk exposure. For this reason, it is very important that harm reduction policies are always carefully evaluated after being introduced to make sure that the benefits exceed the negatives.</p> <p>In the 1980s, my colleagues and I were desperate to establish a pilot needle syringe program. Our concern was that Australia was at risk of severe health, social and economic costs from spread of HIV among and from people who inject drugs ending up with a possible generalized epidemic. This concern was widely shared. But all sorts of groundless concerns were raised about needle syringe programs. Could we prove that this wouldn\u2019t send the wrong message? Would drug use start earlier, become more frequent or last longer? Would the sky fall in? </p> <p>My colleagues and I had to resort to civil disobedience \u2013 starting the pilot program ourselves \u2013 to ensure that a needle and syringe policy was implemented before a generalised HIV epidemic occurred. An independent study commissioned by the commonwealth department of health a quarter century later found that between 2000 and 2009, needle syringe programs in Australia had cost $243m but had prevented an estimated 32,050 HIV and 96,667 hepatitis C new infections and saved the economy between $2.48 and $5.85bn.</p> <p>In the 1999, my colleagues and I again had to resort to civil disobedience to ensure that a medically supervised injecting centre was established in Kings Cross \u2013 we started an illegal medically supervised injecting centre in the Wayside Chapel. </p> <p>That year, 1,116 young Australians died of a heroin overdose with 10% of these deaths occurring within 2km of Kings Cross. A dozen independent evaluations of the centre have been strongly positive and found nothing more than insignificant negatives. When he retired, NSW premier Bob Carr said that establishing the centre was one of his ten proudest achievements. Yet fifteen years later, it\u2019s still the only Drug Consumption Room (DCR) in the country. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/01/if-we-want-to-stop-drug-related-deaths-at-festivals-we-need-a-new-strategy\">If we want to stop drug-related deaths at festivals, we need a new strategy | Bill O'Loughlin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When we suggest that future DCRs should adapt to the changed patterns of drug use and be able to accommodate people who inhale ice, the criticism starts all over again.</p> <p>We follow the same pattern with all the other debates about harm reduction including medicinal cannabis, pill testing, regulation of recreational cannabis, and e-cigarettes: evidence of benefits is minimised while harms and risks are exaggerated.</p> <p>A senate committee in 1977 referred to the \u201cdrug problem problem\u201d, meaning the lamentable quality of the debate about drug policy.
