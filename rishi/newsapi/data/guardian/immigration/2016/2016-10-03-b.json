  "<p>Police, prosecutors and the courts in Britain are \u201cfiltering out\u201d racial elements in hate crime cases, half of reported hate crime is not prosecuted and judges are underusing heavier sentences for hate crime, say Council of Europe anti-racism experts.</p> <p>The European commission against racism and intolerance (Ecri) says racial aspects of hate crime cases are often being filtered out through a combination of an unwillingness to recognise racist motivation, reclassifying racist attacks as disputes or other forms of hostility, and an over-strict interpretation of the legal provisions on racist motivation.</p> <p>The report of experts from 47 European countries, published on Tuesday, also says that about half the hate crime recorded by British police \u2013 including on social media \u2013 goes unpunished because no suspects are identified.</p> <p>The fifth Council of Europe report on racism in the UK highlights concerns over the \u201cconsiderable intolerant element\u201d in the public political debate in Britain, particularly on immigration. </p> <p>The experts say that hate speech continues to be a serious problem in tabloid newspapers, and online hate speech against Muslim people has soared since 2013. They say this is particularly evident in the targeting of Muslim women online on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. </p> <p>\u201cIt is no coincidence that racist violence is on the rise in the UK at the same time as we see worrying examples of intolerance and hate speech in newspapers, online and even among politicians,\u201d said the Ecri chair, Christian Ahlund.</p> <p>\u201cThe Brexit referendum seems to have led to a further rise in \u2018anti-foreigner\u2019 sentiment, making it even more important that the British authorities take the steps outlined in our report as a matter of priority.\u201d</p> <p>Police hate crime figures showed there was a sustained surge in reported hate crime incidents, with a first spike immediately after the 23 June referendum and a second spike at the end of July. Reported hate crime incidents continued to 15-20% higher than the previous 12 months until early September, when weekly figures were no longer released.</p> <p>The Ecri report says Home Office figures show police recorded 52,528 hate-motivated criminal offences in 2014/15, including hate speech and violence covering religious, race and sexual orientation hate crimes.</p> <p> But the Crown Prosecution Service said that 49% of all recorded offences went unprosecuted because no suspect had been identified and the case was closed. \u201cThis means a very large amount of hate crime goes unpunished,\u201d says the report.</p> <p>The anti-racism experts say that heavier \u201cenhanced\u201d sentences are one of the clearest indicators that the police, crown prosecutors and courts have all recognised the hate motivation in a case but say no data is available to show how often they are imposed. This has given rise to speculation that the provision in the 2003 Criminal Justice Act for enhanced sentences is underused.</p> <p>The report also highlights concerns that the process of accepting guilty pleas sometimes leads to the \u201caggravating\u201d race or religious crime element being dropped. The CPS told the commission that it is not policy to accept pleas to lesser offences or to minimise admissible evidence of racial or religious aggravation for the sake of expediency, but guilty pleas can benefit victims and witnesses who then do not have to attend court to give evidence and can substantially reduce costs.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, in light of the considerable evidence that hate crime is more traumatising to victims that other types of crime, the failure to acknowledge the hate motivation is emotionally damaging to victims as it does not recognise the specific harm suffered by them,\u201d says the report.</p> <p>The experts say that the CPS has already taken steps in response to community concerns to reinforce its policy to ensure that the racial aggravation element is not dropped in hate crime cases. But they recommend that data should be recorded when \u201cenhanced sentences\u201d are imposed, including on the criminal record of the offender. Steps also need to be taken to close the 50% gap between hate crime recorded by the police and cases referred for prosecution.</p> <p>The report also praises progress in Britain, including the development by the government and police of a hate crime action plan and a new policy to improve opportunities for black and minority ethnic communities and substantial efforts to promote lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights.</p>",
  "<p>A federal appeals court has issued a stinging ruling dismissing as \u201cnightmare speculation\u201d Indiana governor Mike Pence\u2019s attempt to deter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/refugees-drc-congo-us-syria\">Syrian refugees</a> from settling in the state because of terrorism fears.</p> <p>The decision by the seventh circuit on Monday was the latest legal setback to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/01/indiana-syrian-refugees-resettlement-blocked\">efforts launched by Donald Trump\u2019s running mate</a> in the wake of last November\u2019s Paris terrorist attacks to stop Syrian refugees from coming to Indiana by denying them aid.</p> <p>Like many other states, Indiana receives money from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement and contracts with humanitarian groups to provide local welfare services to refugees. Under federal law, such help must be provided \u201cwithout regard to race, religion, nationality, sex, or political opinion\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/connecticut-welcomes-syrian-refugee-family-indiana-governor-says-no\">Connecticut welcomes Syrian refugee family after Indiana governor says no</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Republican vice-presidential candidate, though, specifically attempted to exclude refugees originating from Syria on the basis that they might be terrorists. He ordered the state not to reimburse groups for the costs of providing aid to Syrians. According to the court, 174 Syrian refugees came to Indiana in the past fiscal year.</p> <p>While this hardline stance may have chimed with the views of Trump, whose immigration policies have included proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US, it was rejected by the three-judge appeals court panel in a six-page ruling that echoed a lower court\u2019s decision earlier this year.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor of Indiana believes, though without evidence, that some of these persons were sent to Syria by ISIS to engage in terrorism and now wish to infiltrate the United States in order to commit terrorist acts here. No evidence of this belief has been presented, however; it is nightmare speculation,\u201d Judge Richard Posner wrote in the <a href=\"http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2016/D10-03/C:16-1509:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1838881:S:0\">opinion</a>.</p> <p>\u201c[Pence] provides no evidence that Syrian terrorists are posing as refugees or that Syrian refugees have ever committed acts of terrorism in the United States. Indeed, as far as can be determined from public sources, no Syrian refugees have been arrested or prosecuted for terrorist acts or attempts in the United States. And if Syrian refugees do pose a terrorist threat, implementation of the governor\u2019s policy would simply increase the risk of terrorism in whatever states Syrian refugees were shunted to.\u201d</p> <p>The opinion adds that Pence\u2019s claim that he is not discriminating based on nationality but purely acting based on safety concerns is \u201cthe equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they\u2019re black but because he\u2019s afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive he isn\u2019t discriminating. But that of course would be racial discrimination, just as his targeting Syrian refugees is discrimination on the basis of nationality.\u201d</p> <p>The outcome was expected after Indiana\u2019s plan was received less than warmly in court during oral arguments last month. Courthouse News reported that Judge Frank Easterbrook <a href=\"http://www.courthousenews.com/2016/09/14/indiana-ban-on-syrian-refugees-draws-mockery-from-7th-circuit.htm\">said</a>: \u201cWhen a state makes an argument that\u2019s saying we\u2019re differentiating according to whether somebody is from Syria, but that has nothing to do with national origin, all it produces is a broad smile.\u201d Posner asked: \u201cAre Syrians the only Muslims that Indiana fears?\u201d</p> <p>Ken Falk, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, said in a statement: \u201cThe Court of Appeals\u2019 decision underscores what we have said throughout this litigation \u2026 Governor Pence may not constitutionally or legally discriminate against a particular nationality of refugees that are extensively vetted by the federal government.\u201d The ACLU represented Exodus Refugee Immigration, a not-for-profit agency that brought the lawsuit.</p> <p>With immigration and battling Isis key issues in the forthcoming presidential election, leading Republican politicians have accused the federal government of failing to adequately screen refugees and several states have tried to exert more control over who is resettled inside their borders, though immigration is a federal matter.</p> <p>Last Friday, Texas became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/texas-withdraws-federal-refugee-resettlement-program-syrians\">latest state</a> to opt out of the federal refugee resettlement programme, following New Jersey and Kansas earlier this year.</p> <p>But the move will not stop the arrival of refugees from Syria or anywhere else in the Lone Star state. The federal government and aid agencies will instead work to formulate an arrangement that circumvents the state\u2019s administration of the process.</p> <p>The Obama administration has pledged to increase the number of refugees arriving in the US from Syria and other nations. The president <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/a/us-narrowly-misses-refugee-limit-for-2016/3533782.html\">announced last month</a> that the US would accept 110,000 in fiscal year 2017 \u2013 up from 85,000 in 2016, of which more than 12,500 were Syrian.</p> <p>Pence faces off against Tim Kaine, his Democratic opponent, in the vice-presidential debate in Virginia on Tuesday.</p>",

This is admirable. But the conference\u2019s post-referendum delirium feels depressing; much of the time like stumbling into a Ukip event. Speeches from the podium talk of taking back control from Europe and imply that other nations will do exactly as Britain tells them, while in fringe meetings they discuss how to stop migration and bring back grammar schools. All that is missing are the purple and yellow ties.</p> <p>Brexit has impacted inevitably on political discourse in both main parties, especially on immigration. A book by Gary Gibbon, the Channel 4 News political editor, suggests the Australian points system was only pushed by leave campaigners to send a <a href=\"http://mogaznews.com/en/World-News/187939.html\">dog-whistle signal to white voters</a> since that nation is seen as overwhelmingly white.

Those of us who think it a disastrous idea need to stop being so stunned by this self-harming decision and start forging a sensible response to protect the economy and liberal values. Not least since May has interpreted the referendum result as first and foremost a vote to curb immigration, so will sacrifice single-market membership to impose restrictions on free movement.</p> <p>Clearly the prime minister is adopting a negotiating stance ahead of tough talks over terms of departure. But it was noticeable that she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\">singled out food labelling</a> when discussing sovereignty in her Sunday speech, since this ultimately comes under World Trade Organisation deals that will still be binding post Brexit. This underscores spurious claims of \u201ctaking back control\u201d in such an interlocked world. Meanwhile one cabinet minister said that economic corrosion caused by Brexit may slow down flows of migrants moving here for work.</p> <p>But most dismaying is the mixture of naivety, arrogance and rank hypocrisy found behind the Brexit bravura. No one seems to have a clue as to what sort of agreement can be achieved with our closest trading partners in Europe. The Brexit ministry is still scrabbling to find skilled negotiators, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">article 50 is being triggered within five months</a>. Then Britain will have just two years to sort a trade deal with a bloc of 27 nations that does not want to undermine a union based on free markets and free movement. Yes, they have concerns over migration \u2013 but that is from outside, not within, the EU. At the same time, those new negotiators must do bilateral deals with dozens more nations whose EU agreements will no longer apply to us.</p> <p>Ministers admit they may have to use billions saved from Brussels to bail out firms suffering Brexit fallout, while Downing Street has offered indemnities to alarmed trading partners. Bear in mind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/brexit-canada-trade-deal-eu-model-next-steps\">Canada has taken seven years to sort an EU trade deal</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/02/article-50-trade-eu-deals-globalisation\">Switzerland took 17 years</a> to sign one insurance agreement.<a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/opinion/dont-look-to-norway-brexiteers/\"> Norway lost 20,000 jobs</a> and chunks of its fish-processing industry to Denmark and Poland because of having to accept EU tariffs, underlining how duties can distort markets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad02b45538725413636f3f5ae61ab60f9eceabd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad02b45538725413636f3f5ae61ab60f9eceabd0/0_162_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delegates at the Conservative conference in Birmingham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delegates at the Conservative conference in Birmingham: \u2018all that is missing are the purple and yellow ties\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When pressed about the outcome, a key minister kept repeating to me \u201cthe best possible deal\u201d before finally confessing that Britain would end up accepting the imposition of some tariffs. Another talked airily of deals with Australia, which represents less than 2% of our trade. A third cheerily insisted that City financiers would not wish to move to Frankfurt. A fourth repeated the tired mantra that Europe will give in to British demands because of the size of our economy.</p> <p>We hear brave talk of Britain\u2019s new role in the world, exemplified by <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/02/boris-johnson-bbc-is-infuriatingly-anti-brexit-but-remains-singl/\">Boris Johnson\u2019s speech on soft-power strength</a>. But we also learn of fresh limits on foreign students, despite the global success of our universities, and on foreign workers, who fuel growth in so many sectors (and prop up public services). Already the tightening of visas, plus exorbitant costs, is undermining the ability and desire of many in Africa and Asia to trade with Britain. Incidentally the foreign secretary should remember that <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/uk/361393-boris-johnson-africa-country/\">Africa is not one country</a> \u2013 a slip in his speech that spoke volumes about attitudes.</p> <p>Polling indicates that despite the Brexit vote most voters are unwilling to see their own income fall to reduce immigration.

European ambitions that were entertained just two decades ago seem to have shrivelled, opening up a Pandora\u2019s box of grievances. Of course, the 2008 financial crisis hasn\u2019t helped, but economic statistics often fail to measure the gap between what citizens expected their lives to be like and what they feel they have ended up with.</p> <p>A Czech friend of mine who recently returned to Prague after spending 15 years working in Asia told me how impressed he was by the improvement in living standards since the 90s, and yet how depressing it was to see that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/15/milos-zeman-czech-republic-president-populists-post-communist\" title=\"\">populist agenda</a> had now taken hold.</p> <p>A nation that spent decades behind the iron curtain is today a full-blown member of the European club, enjoying consumerism, better housing, better everything, its citizens no longer in the grip of a repressive police state or waiting in endless queues at food shops. Yet despite these changes there is deep frustration \u2013 which illiberal politicians are fast capitalising on.</p> <p>People are obsessed with fears stoked by politicians and much of the media about the supposed threat of Muslim migrants swarming into the country. Czech president Milo\u0161 Zeman is notorious for fanning conspiracy theories about a radical Islamic takeover of Europe. None of this bears any relation to reality. But the very notion of refugees has been conflated with video images of Islamic State militants chopping off heads.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Just 131 people were granted asylum in the Czech Republic in the first half of this year \u2013 64 of them Chinese Christians</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bewildered by this, my friend checked some facts: it turns out that just 131 people were granted asylum in the Czech Republic in the first half of this year \u2013 64 of them Chinese Christians fleeing persecution.</p> <p>Paranoia about refugees is now spread widely throughout the west. But something distinct seems to be at play in central Europe, and it can\u2019t just be explained by the fact that these countries have historically had little or no experience, historically, of immigration from the global south.</p> <p>The need to find scapegoats in countries that have hardly taken in any refugees draws from a particular frustration that has grown over time \u2013 that of comparing one\u2019s life with the life enjoyed by western neighbours, not with what it was like a generation ago.</p> <p>In the Czech Republic, although living standards have risen, wages and GDP per capita remain well below those of neighbouring Germany. When Czechs joined the EU in 2004, the general feeling was that the country had finally \u201cmade it\u201d. But prosperity didn\u2019t follow at the speed many hoped for, and people seem to think they\u2019re still second-tier members of the EU club.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Europe too, it\u2019s not that real problems don\u2019t exist (unemployment, corruption, growing inequalities); it\u2019s that they are compounded by the way many people compare their current lives with what they felt entitled to expect. Paradoxically, criticism of the EU institutions sits side by side with a genuine attachment to the union. The latest <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/eurobarometre/2016/attentes/eb85_1_synthesis_perceptions_wishes_terrorism_en.pdf\" title=\"\">Eurobarometer poll</a>, published in June, shows 75% of Czechs believe that \u201cwhat brings the the citizens of the different EU member states together is more important than what separates them\u201d.</p> <p>I thought about this when reading another completely different study, carried out among French Muslims. It pointed to a perhaps comparable phenomenon of frustration. The reasons why some French Muslims feel disenfranchised are too long to list here, but the Paris-based Institut Montaigne\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.institutmontaigne.org/fr/publications/un-islam-francais-est-possible\" title=\"\">recent survey</a> also highlighted a generational gap. What first-generation migrants expected from life in France, when they moved there for work in the 1960s and 70s, is something second and third generations no longer accept as anything close to satisfying.</p> <p>Half of the 28% of French Muslims who say they dislike the republican model of integration are between 15 and 24 years old. This is the group, says the institute, that turns to \u201crigorist\u201d Islam as a way of expressing a generational revolt.

The young tend to see what they don\u2019t have (German wages, equal opportunities), whereas previous generations felt, to a degree, that they had \u201cmade it\u201d (joining the EU, or establishing themselves in the developed world).</p> <p>It\u2019s as if, in today\u2019s Europe, it has become much harder to cross social and economic boundaries than it was once to break out from behind the iron curtain, or get a migrant\u2019s residence permit.

(One wonders how many suburban pubs Kelly has visited lately.)</p> <p>More perfidy and error comes from the direction of those Kelly refers to only as \u201cconservative ideologues\u201d. (We might wonder if he doesn\u2019t offer names because he shares a Holt Street lunchroom with some of them.) These people are accused of \u201cpumping her up as part of their fanatical campaign to destroy Malcolm Turnbull\u201d. </p> <p>With more contortions than usual, Kelly attempted to nominate a position between these two extremes. We must realise, he wrote, that the polling reflects a rejection of Islamic extremist ideology, and that \u201cmutual respect is vital but it needs to rest on a firm foundation that rejects both Hanson\u2019s prejudice and progressive denial of reality\u201d. </p> <p>It\u2019s the same boring routine with the same stock characters \u2013 the out-of-touch left and the extremist right \u2013 acting as foils to Kelly\u2019s own, allegedly pragmatic, centre-right position. </p> <p>In this instance, though, Kelly whitewashes the real lesson of recent Australian history: that conservatives \u2013 including a number of Kelly\u2019s colleagues \u2013 have mainstreamed ideas, resentments and prejudices that Hanson first introduced from the fringes of the far right. </p> <p>One artefact illuminates this point quite well. In 1997 \u2013 somewhere between the formation of One Nation that April and <a href=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2014/11/21/guess-whos-back-top-10-moments-of-pauline-hanson/\">Hanson\u2019s \u201cassassination\u201d video</a> \u2013 a book was published called Pauline Hanson: The Truth. </p> <p>Issued under the authorship of one George J Merritt, its first half was a compilation of Hanson speeches and press releases through 1996. Its second half was a collection of essays by members of the Pauline Hanson Support Movement in defence of Hanson. </p> <p>Both halves show us the degree to which conservatives with mainstream credentials and prominent platforms have come to resemble the Hansonists of the 1990s, and the extent to which mainstream conservatism as a whole has moved in a Hansonist direction over the past two decades.</p> <p>One example is Hansonist anti-intellectualism which was fertilised during the Howard years, and has now ripened into an increasingly mainstream conservative appetite for conspiracy theory. </p> <p>Pauline Hanson: The Truth reprints a speech Hanson made to the far-right, pro-gun Australian Reform party in 1996, where she nominates a range of people who exist to \u201cdenigrate Australian culture\u201d \u2013 \u201csome of these people are leaders of ethnic groups, some are what I call academic snobs, some are in parliament, and some come from the media\u201d. </p> <p>In the second half of the book, a more conspiratorial note is struck on intellectuals by one of her supporters writing on \u201cThe New Class\u201d, described as a \u201cruling elite that controls, not only by armed force and money, but also by ideas\u201d. </p> <p>The New Class are \u201ccoercive utopians\u201d, who constitute a \u201ccognitive elite \u2026 primarily created by the university system\u201d. They are the \u201cradicals of the 1960s who have now become the liberal-left establishment\u201d. </p> <p>They promote a \u201cnew religion of internationalism \u2013 of anti-white racism, multiculturalism, feminism and Asianisation\u201d.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://books.google.com.au/books?id=-DtPBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT9&amp;lpg=PT9&amp;dq=david+marr+howard+government+attacks+critics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qv4UCi391r&amp;sig=IWh4dkwCfWxG6E7j87P6VF9n1KY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20marr%20howard%20government%20attacks%20critics&amp;f=false\">increasing hostility to intellectuals</a> on the part of mainstream conservatives was borne out in Howard government attacks on universities, and eventually on any credentialled experts who spoke out against it. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hanson\u2019s conspiracy-tinged contempt for intellectuals is now regularly expressed on the pages of the national broadsheet</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More strikingly, though, Hansonist attacks on intellectuals came to be voiced by mainstream conservative commentators in the vocabulary of the far right. </p> <p>Kelly\u2019s colleague at the Australian, Nick Cater, disparaged what he called a \u201cnew class\u201d of \u201ctertiary-educated, middle-class professionals\u201d which \u201cpresumes to possess superior insights and manners to the broad mass of people\u201d and \u201celevates its own status by devaluing that of others\u201d.</p> <p>Soon enough, <a href=\"http://www.luckyculture.com.au/media-library/making-friends-with-the-fright-bats/\">Cater was putting this argument</a> in the vocabulary of \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/22/chris-uhlmann-should-mind-his-language-on-cultural-marxism\">a conspiracy theory</a> which itself originated and still flourishes on the far right. Cater said Bill Shorten\u2019s expressed wish to help more women to become MPs was derived from ideas which were a \u201clegacy of the thuggish, subversive world of West German political activism\u201d in the 1960s.</p> <p>This theme has since been taken up by others on the centre right including <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/there-was-a-time-when-journalists-backed-free-speech/news-story/4704bea05341f9f674cb526470260601\">Chris Uhlmann, who explained</a> criticism of Tony Abbott\u2019s speaking engagements as an outcome of cultural Marxism. </p> <p>Hanson\u2019s conspiracy-tinged contempt for intellectuals is now regularly expressed on the pages of the national broadsheet by mainstream centre-right journalists. </p> <p>A second example is offered by the Hansonist approach to Indigenous Australians. Pauline Hanson: The Truth reproduces a long press release detailing the myriad benefits she alleged that Indigenous Australians then received and that white Australians did not \u2013 what she called \u201cinequalities between black and white Australians\u201d. </p> <p>This theme \u2013 resentment towards a dispossessed people \u2013 is not only repeated throughout the book.

We are leaving the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">European Union</a>. But it is equally clear to me that the British people did not vote on 23 June to become poorer or less secure.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cOur task is clear: repatriate our sovereignty, control our borders and seize the opportunities that the wider world has to offer \u2026 but do all of this while protecting our economy, our jobs and our living standards.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking in the wake of May\u2019s address to the conference, which <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/may-on-collision-course-with-backbenchers-seeking-soft-brexit\">appeared to hint that the government</a> was pursuing a hard Brexit without full access to the EU\u2019s single market, Hammond noted that many businesses were unsure about what lay ahead.</p> <p>The pound was down sharply against the euro on Sunday as traders digested the implications of May\u2019s speech, falling as low as \u20ac1.1434 at one point, the weakest since the summer of 2013. Sterling was also down more than 1% against the US dollar, to as low as $1.2818, just a fifth of a cent off its 31-year low in early July.</p> <p>Experts said sterling had lost value on expectations a hard Brexit would damage the UK\u2019s trading position and depress overseas investment in the UK. Such fears have been central in investors\u2019 minds after car company Nissan warned last week that its future in Britain was not assured in the event of a hard Brexit.</p> <p>The prospect of a hard Brexit would have \u201cprofound consequences across larger swaths of the UK economy\u201d, said economists at the bank Daiwa. \u201cOverseas firms invest here precisely because of the UK\u2019s access to the single market ... No doubt those firms that were putting in contingency plans to move some of their operations to other EU locations, so as to be able to continue doing business in the world\u2019s largest single market after the UK has left, will now step up those efforts,\u201d they added.</p> <p>Sterling\u2019s weakness contrasted with a rally on stock markets, where share prices were lifted by a combination of near-term economic optimism, relief over May providing some certainty on Brexit timing and the effects of a weak pound, which flatters the earnings of UK-listed firms reporting in dollars. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares rose more than 1.2% to a 16-month high of 6,983.52.</p> <p>In his speech, Hammond promised to pay down the deficit, but to do so at a slower and more flexible pace. He will set out new spending plans \u2013 and revised economic forecasts \u2013 in his autumn statement in November.</p> <p>The scale of the challenge facing the government in resetting Britain\u2019s trading relationships became clear when Alexander Downer, the Australian high commissioner to the UK, spoke up from the audience at a fringe event to warn that his country would be unable to contemplate a trade deal with Britain unless it leaves the single market and customs union.</p> <p>\u201cFor us, there is a huge outstanding issue about membership of the single market and customs union. I don\u2019t think everyone understands this but it will not be possible to negotiate a free trade agreement with Australia, the US or others [if the UK stays in them] \u2026 If the UK remains in the single market and customs union, we will negotiate just with Brussels,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Theresa Villiers, a former cabinet minister and MEP, said he was absolutely right and the UK would need to come out of both.</p>",

A lot more.</p> <p>Instead of which, we have Hammond. Taken seriously, all the announcements of the past two days boil down to four words: Hard Brexit, Softer Austerity. In her speech on Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\" title=\"\">Theresa May made it clear</a> that bringing down immigration is more important than maintaining a place in the single market. Come next spring, Britain will be heading out of Europe entirely. Hammond clearly believes that will produce a big hit to our national income \u2013 not in one go, but over a number of years.</p> <p>He has good reason to think so. Look, for instance, at the <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/agentssummary/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Bank of England\u2019s agent reports</a>. This is the stuff Carney and the monetary policy committee pore over when setting interest rates: a regular summary of discussions with around 700 businesses from all sectors across the entire country. For months, the agents\u2019 scores of business intentions to invest have been flatlining \u2013 while the indices for willingness to take on new staff are now negative. Meanwhile, in the press <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/its-blackmail-really-nissan-employees-on-the-brexit-compensation-demand\" title=\"\">big employers such as Nissan</a> are now effectively demanding danger money to keep investing in Britain. For the past few months, the press has been playing a lovely parlour game of \u201cwhere\u2019s the Brexit crash?\u201d, when they ought to have been looking out for the Brexit slowdown.</p> <p>A smart man, Hammond gets this. Yet he does little to mitigate the coming pain. The big policy of his speech is that he will dump George Osborne\u2019s debt targets \u2013 which he would in any case have missed. The big spending commitment is an extra \u00a33bn towards housebuilding (plus \u00a32bn for an \u201caccelerated construction\u201d scheme) of which, by the Tories\u2019 own admission, the majority is old funds re-labelled. That is after three months on the job. By comparison, within three weeks of moving into No 11 in May 2010, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8699522.stm\" title=\"\">Osborne had already found over \u00a36bn of spending cuts</a>.</p> <p>Come his autumn statement, my bet is that Hammond will do a bit more tweaking \u2013 perhaps to capital allowances or business rates. Such policies will be cocktail umbrellas in the face of the gale that the chancellor himself is expecting. As the former Bank of England rate-setter David Blanchflower says: \u201cMark Carney is now the only adult left in the room.\u201d Except with interest rates at 0.1% and hundreds of billions already pumped into financial markets, Threadneedle Street is nearly tapped out. The only other lever policymakers are allowed to pull is to permit the pound to tank, to provide some succour to exporters.</p> <p>Under Osborne and Cameron, failed austerity could always be excused by the shadow bankers who had bankrolled their general election campaigns and got the tax cuts they wanted. Then there was big business, scared of Red Ed and his promises to tackle predatory capitalism. But this policy crisis comes on top of a structural crisis of Conservatism. Cameron and May have just held and bungled a referendum that their backers in Big Business and Big Finance never wanted. To stave off Ukip, the Tories must inevitably attack the very interest groups that have for years kept them in power. The only thing keeping them in power is the assurance, spread loyally by the press, that things really would be so much worse if Labour were in charge.</p>",

She is not a criminal,\u201d her publisher, Sandro Ferri, told La Repubblica, saying she was being treated like a member of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/30/italian-police-find-van-goghs-stolen-in-amsterdam-gallery-heist\">Camorra</a>, the ruthless Neapolitan mafia. From Erri De Luca to Loredana Lipperini (who writes under a pseudonym), the consensus among top Italian writers was that the alleged outing of Ferrante was a dark day for journalism and that her work ought to speak for itself. One Roman paper questioned whether Gatti had pursued Ferrante with a \u201cfury that was worthy of a better cause\u201d.<br></p> <p>Readers have also questioned whether Ferrante\u2019s alleged unmasking \u2013 from the pursuit of the story to the publication of the news by the New York Review of Books, among others \u2013 was linked to sexism: a determination to undermine the desire of a feminist writer to be left out of the public eye.</p> <p>But even as Gatti\u2019s journalistic tactics and motivation have faced scrutiny, some are also curious about the news that he allegedly revealed, and the way details about Raja\u2019s life may contrast with the image Ferrante\u2019s readers had built in their minds about one of the most celebrated writers of our time.</p> <p>The allegation that the woman behind the critically acclaimed My Brilliant Friend and the rest of the Neapolitan series is a Rome-based translator and Germanophile has shattered some illusions about the writer\u2019s biography, including details she herself put forward in a book called La Frantumaglia. As Gatti said, Ferrante\u2019s suggestion that she was the daughter of a seamstress who spoke in Neapolitan dialect, and grew up in a home with few books, seems very distinct from the alleged reality. He has seized on the potential discrepancies as a justification for his investigation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"05501597afee2848b4602870af8868a0c12dec04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05501597afee2848b4602870af8868a0c12dec04/0_31_1591_955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anita Raja a Rome-based translator, possibly the real identity of author Elena Ferrante.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anita Raja.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: http://www.nybooks.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI would like to stress that Elena Ferrante (with the help of her publishers) was the very first person to violate Elena Ferrante\u2019s privacy.

The Neapolitan seamstress mother, the three sisters, her life in Naples. They were all lies,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>But fans have insisted this is a perverse misunderstanding of both Ferrante and literary technique. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/02/unmastered-desire-katherine-angel-review\">Katherine Angel</a>, an academic, told BBC Radio 4: \u201cShe\u2019s a woman writer who has written very eloquently in many interviews about the reasons for this anonymity, which is that she did not want to have her work biographically reduced and didn\u2019t want to have to be involved in the sort of circus of the personality, the celebrity author.\u201d Ferrante has openly said she would be willing to bend the truth if asked to talk about her life.</p> <p>Raja, Gatti reported, is the daugher of a German-born Jewish woman named Golda Frieda Petzenbaum who escaped the Holocaust to Milan with her family, before fleeing to Switzerland. Petzenbaum was a refugee for two years before she was reunited with her family in Naples, where they eventually settled.</p> <p> Raja\u2019s father was a Neapolitan magistrate, and they moved to Rome when she was three. Such is the nature of Ferrante\u2019s writing that many fans have assumed her novels must have been born out of a tough Neapolitan childhood, where, like her protagonist Elena, she would have suffered under the claustrophobia of living in an impoverished neighbourhood and witnessed the savagery of the Camorra before escaping and finding success as a writer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/03/elena-ferrante-in-her-own-words-to-relinquish-my-anonymity-would-be-very-painful\">Elena Ferrante in her own words: \u2018To relinquish my anonymity would be very painful\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead, the woman who is alleged to be the real Ferrante grew up in Rome, probably not under the same financial stresses that Ferrante has described.

But in one full-page spread that led the culture section of Il Messaggero, a reporter suggested that the news had created a new desire to understand Ferrante\u2019s demand for anonymity.</p> <p>Was it really, as Ferrante has steadfastly said, rooted in a decision to reject the culture of self-promotion, shield her privacy and give her the freedom to let her work speak for itself?

Therefore, it is important to consider the combined effect of the full package of our policy measures when assessing the impact of our monetary policy action on banks. </p> <p>Low rates put pressure on banks\u2019 profitability, particularly on banks which are very reliant on net interest income. Analysts forecast that negative interest rates will significantly reduce banks\u2019 profitability over the next five years, with the return on equity in some cases falling from 6.5% to 2%. </p> <p>Obviously, our monetary policy package consists of other measures as well and ECB staff estimates show that the <strong>overall</strong> impact on bank profitability of recent monetary policy actions is net positive, compared with a scenario with no monetary policy action<sup>[<a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2016/html/sp161003.en.html#footnote.2\">2</a>]</sup>. But we cannot ignore such analyses. And yet, one also has to ask if a bank that cannot weather headwinds over a few years still has a sufficiently robust business model to stay in the market.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mersh added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Interest rates have to stay low until the economic recovery in the euro area has gained sufficient momentum to lift the inflation rate to a level in line with our definition of price stability. This is, however, taking longer than we had hoped, mainly because the necessary political changes to make economies more competitive and flexible are lagging behind. The sooner these reforms are implemented, the stronger and more sustainable the recovery will be. </p> <p>Although the notion of a \u201czero lower bound\u201d no longer stands, there is a limit to how low interest rates can go \u2013 the point at which the costs of lower rates incurred by the banking sector outweigh the benefits. Many consider that we have reached the \u201ceffective lower bound\u201d or that it might be not that far from the current deposit facility rate of -0.4%. </p> <p>This level I would still deem to be \u201cmildly negative\u201d \u2013 but I would shy away from moving into \u201cwildly negative\u201d territory.

Along with confirmation that the Government will trigger Article 50 by next March, this may have increased concerns over the ultimate economic impact of the vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>But there are a number of reasons not to be concerned about the currency\u2019s depreciation. For a start, it is far from clear that further indications of a move towards a hard Brexit should necessarily be strongly negative for the economy or the pound. They may, after all, reflect increased confidence that the UK can negotiate favourable trading arrangements with the EU without the conditions that a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d might imply.</p> <p>Second, the key driver of sterling\u2019s depreciation (against the US dollar at least) has continued to be relative changes in expectations for UK and US interest rates. As such, there are few signs of a general \u201cBrexit premium\u201d being attached to the currency which might prompt a more disorderly depreciation.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>And finally, regardless of its causes, the drop in sterling has already had a substantial effect in cushioning the economic impact of the Brexit vote. Monday\u2019s Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI survey revealed a further rise in the export orders sub-index to a level consistent with a rapid acceleration in the growth of actual exports in the coming months.</p> <p>Admittedly, the economy may currently be in a \u201csweet spot\u201d in which the beneficial effects of the pound\u2019s drop have been felt before the adverse effects on real incomes of the consequent rise in inflation. But provided that the pound\u2019s fall remains relatively orderly \u2013 our forecast is that it will fall from around $1.28 now to $1.20 next year \u2013 we expect the inflationary effects to be fairly limited and short-lived, allowing the policymakers to continue to support growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f266bde4b0ff53b531bbb3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T14:40:16.310Z\">3.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek pensioner protests overshadow budget unveiling</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to Greece where pictures of police firing tear gas at pensioners peacefully demonstrating against further cuts has caused deep embarrassment to the government \u2013 just as it tables next year\u2019s budget in parliament. Helena Smith reports from Athens </p> <blockquote> <p>The sight of protesting pensioners having pepper spray fired at them by police overzealously protecting the road on which his office stands, could not have come on a worse day for prime minister Alexis Tsipras. The leader, like all leftists in the ruling Syriza party, is painfully aware that it is pensioners who to date have paid the heaviest price for the austerity meted out in return for bailout funds. As I was told by many attending today\u2019s (otherwise low-key) rally, the latest cut was the twelfth they have been forced to endure since the beginning of the debt crisis in late 2009. To make matters worse, Tsipras\u2019 poll ratings are fading fast. In the most scathing survey to be published since he first assumed power in January 2015 \u2013 and in the newspaper of Avgi, the mouthpiece of his ruling Syriza party no less - the leader was found by the Public Issue polling company to be trailing Kyriakos Mitsotakis, chief of main opposition New Democracy, by 19 points in terms of suitability in the role of prime minister (42 percent against 23 percent). A whopping 36 percent of Greeks said they would prefer to see New Democracy in power compared to 14 percent for Syriza and its junior right wing partner, Anel. </p> <p>Which explains why Tsipras, who was otherwise focusing on what he hoped would be an optimistic draft budget forecasting growth and debt decline, personally called the pubic order minister in fury that the tear gas was used at all. In an unprecedented statement the ministry announced: \u201cAfter today\u2019s incident the order was given to forbid any use of tear gas at demonstrations of workers and pensioners.\u201d </p> <p>That notwithstanding, the episode duly eclipsed any talk of the draft budget - which foresees growth of 2.7 per cent n 2017, debt dropping from 180 to 174.8 per cent of GDP and unemployment falling from 23 to 22.4 percent next year \u2013 being tabled and debated in parliament. Greek media have not been slow to pick up on the fact that it also projects an extra \u20ac1.8bn worth of revenues in taxes \u2013 prompting many to say that yet more punitive belt-tightening measures are on the way. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fad7952f9f110336c6737afe6ab1ad11cbd6f9b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fad7952f9f110336c6737afe6ab1ad11cbd6f9b7/0_0_4826_3205/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors clash with police in Athens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protestors clash with police in Athens</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ZUMA W/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f269d8e4b0328d7eb88c9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T14:25:39.387Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland will pay Connecticut $120m to resolve a mortgage bond probe, </strong>according to Reuters.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as investors await news about whether the $14bn fine on Deutsche Bank demanded by the US Department of Justice will be reduced, the bank\u2019s US shares have now dropped by around 2.5%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f2682ce4b0ff53b531bbbc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T14:17:42.344Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The ISM report could also signal a reasonable non-farm payrolls number on Friday, says James Knightley at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Looking to Friday\u2019s payrolls figure, the ISM employment component has offered encouragement to us regarding our above consensus 210,000 prediction for job creation.

With populism gaining traction in many countries, the risk of political shocks adversely affecting the outlook for private investment has increased. At the same time, the capacity of central banks to engender stronger growth appears to be diminishing...</p> <p>With eurozone growth looking likely to have peaked in early 2016 and no significant changes to Fitch\u2019s UK and Japanese growth forecasts - despite significant monetary policy moves - the outlook for the advanced countries is best described as a low-growth, muddle-through path. Advanced country growth over 2016 to 2018 will be hardly any better than the lacklustre 1.5% annual average growth rate seen over 2011 to 2015. Moreover, downside risks to advanced country growth have increased.</p> <p>\u201cThe rise in populism seen in many advanced countries could be a precursor to increased trade-protectionism and growing fragmentary tensions in the eurozone, both of which would increase uncertainty and damage prospects for private sector investment,\u201d added [Fitch chief economist Brian] Coulton.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the US in particular it says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fitch has revised down its forecast for US growth in 2016 to 1.4% in today\u2019s Global Economic Outlook from 1.8% in the July [report].</p> <p>\u201cThis year is likely to see the lowest annual growth rate for US GDP since 2009 as oil sector adjustments, weak external demand and the earlier appreciation of the dollar take their toll on industrial demand,\u201d said [Coulton].</p> </blockquote> <p>Fitch also believes central banks may be running out of ammunition:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Meanwhile, the capacity of central banks to counter adverse growth shocks may be falling. The implications of low and negative interest rates for bank profitability, the increasing complexity of central bank easing announcements, reductions in interest income for savers and market distortions are complicating the transmission of unconventional monetary easing to the economy. Furthermore, the historically unprecedented nature of negative nominal interest rates may be limiting the benefits of central bank easing announcements on inflation expectations.</p> <p>Rising political pressures and concerns about the effectiveness of monetary easing have contributed to growing support among policy makers for fiscal stimulus as a means of restoring growth. A wider shift to fiscal easing is increasingly apparent in the numbers and while its effectiveness may be hindered in some countries by high and rising public debt levels, a co-ordinated fiscal reflation is likely to have growth benefits, at least in the short term.</p> <p> The Fed is likely to be the only major central bank tightening monetary policy in the near term as it lays the groundwork for a December rate rise. With unit labour costs and core inflation measures suggesting underlying inflation close to the Fed\u2019s target and the labour market holding up, the conditions look to be in place for a continuation of gradual normalisation in the Federal Funds Rate. The ECB is expected to extend its quantitative easing programme beyond its current scheduled end-date of March 2017, and will likely need to adjust the limits on bond purchases. The new monetary policy approach adopted by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) opens the door for further cuts in the policy rate, taking it deeper into negative territory. This will allow the BOJ to steepen the yield curve while it varies its asset purchases to hold 10-year JGB yields flat at around 0%. We now forecast the BOJ policy rate will fall to -0.5% by end-2017. </p> <p>In the UK, the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) aggressive easing package in early August has had a positive impact on sentiment. With recent UK data slightly better than expected, the BoE is unlikely to follow through on forward guidance to cut rates again before year-end.</p> </blockquote> <p>In emerging markets, Fitch sees signs of improvement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Most importantly, China\u2019s efforts to stabilise growth in the face of a sharp slowdown in exports and private-sector investment look to have gained traction. Russia\u2019s economy looks to be stabilising after massive import compression, real wage adjustment and fiscal tightening saw domestic demand plummet in 2015. In Brazil, the impeachment of President Rousseff and installation of a new leadership team have renewed focus on fiscal reforms, which should support confidence and help the economy stabilise by year-end. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f23db1e4b05962fdf4a67d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:39:15.161Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary: Factories fly, but pound slides</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Time for a catch-up, as City traders scoff down a quick sandwich before facing another volley of economic data from across the Atlantic.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/03/pound-falls-hard-brexit-deutsche-bank-manufacturing-data-business-live?page=with:block-57f21706e4b0ab00630875ae#block-57f21706e4b0ab00630875ae\">Activity in Britain\u2019s factory sector has grown at its fastest pace since June 2014, bolstering hopes that the EU referendum won\u2019t trigger a recession</a>.</strong></p> <p>Exports, new orders and staffing levels all increased in September, as the weak pound helps firms sell overseas.</p> <p>Economists broadly agree that UK manufacturing appears to be in decent health right now, and helped the economy grow in the last quarter.</p> <p>Capital Economics, for example, say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI for September showed that both the domestic and export-facing parts of the manufacturing sector are weathering the Brexit vote well.

Much of what he said was similar to what he said in a speech last week, making the case for free trade, but there were some new arguments in it. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Fox said globalisation offered great opportunities to the UK.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The phenomenon that we have come to know since the mid-1990s as globalisation represents an acceleration of the trend in which the world is increasingly compressed economically, culturally and politically. </p> <p>It brings with it an increasing interdependence that means we cannot insulate ourselves from instability in far-flung parts of the global economy. </p> <p>But it has also brought the chance to share prosperity, liberty and empowerment with millions of our fellow human beings across the world who had only ever known poverty, hopelessness and oppression.</p> <p>The ability to trade every minute and everywhere means that we have the opportunity to increase our links with those trading partners and markets who are functionally like us but not necessarily geographically close to us.</p> <p>Technological advances are dissolving away the barriers of time and distance. </p> <p>I have often said that if Francis Fukuyama had called his book \u201cthe end of geography\u201d rather than \u201cthe end of history\u201d then he would have been more accurate about the world in which we now find ourselves. </p> <p>I think the term globalisation could almost have been written with Britain in mind. It is an era where we have a tremendous opportunity to help shape the world around us for the benefit of all.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government should help those at risk of losing out from globalisation by focusing on improving people\u2019s skills.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said \u201cisolationism and protectionism never end well\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He confirmed that Britain could not negotiate trade deals while it remained a member of the EU.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While we remain inside the European Union we are bound by its rules not to negotiate any new trade agreements, although we are able to discuss the impediments that we might wish to eliminate ahead of agreements we might reach with other countries when we leave.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is worth pointing out that this is quite different from what <strong>David Davis</strong> said <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2016/07/david-davis-trade-deals-tax-cuts-and-taking-time-before-triggering-article-50-a-brexit-economic-strategy-for-britain.html\">in a ConservativeHome article in July about the Brexit strategy. </a>Writing shortly before he became Brexit secretary Davis said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So be under no doubt: we can do deals with our trading partners, and we can do them quickly. I would expect the new prime minister on September 9th to immediately trigger a large round of global trade deals with all our most favoured trade partners.

As well as abandoning their own fiscal charter, this was full of the same empty promises George Osborne made, only with worse gags.</p> <p>The chancellor should apologise today for the failed Tory approach that has meant he has had to abandon the failed economic agenda of the last six years, an approach which has seen them dragging their heels on tax avoidance, an increase in child poverty and housebuilding falling to its lowest peacetime rate since the 1920s. The dangerous divide in society the chancellor mentioned has come about as a direct result of the policies he has voted for since 2010.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"850dd61407c2752e4ca2c2e3cbab71a66c309b8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/850dd61407c2752e4ca2c2e3cbab71a66c309b8a/0_112_5256_3154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John McDonnell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John McDonnell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T12:41:42.826Z\">at 1.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f24f66e4b05962fdf4a6db\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T12:32:00.187Z\">1.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance</strong> has criticised Philip Hammond\u2019s speech.

Under Gordon Brown and George Osborne, this speech was always a highly charged event, combining forceful rhetoric with surprise policy statements that would set the agenda for days, weeks or even longer. Alistair Darling was less of a showman, but for most of his time as chancellor, the UK was facing a severe economic crisis, which gave anything he had to say an edge. Ken Clarke was less given to stunts, but at least he knew how to perform. Hammond, by comparison, had less fizz than a low-energy lightbulb.</p> <p>In news terms, the main point was what he had to say about abandoning deficit elimination by 2020 as a target. But if you listened to him on the Today programme this morning, he explained his thinking just as clearly, if not better, there than he did in his speech. Hammond did say that he might have to revise \u201cfiscal policy\u201d to help the UK cope with Brexit-related turbulance (increase spending or cut taxes), but he offered no clues as to his thinking and we are going to have to wait until the autumn statement to find out what he has in mind. The only other announcement in the speech was a guarantee that projects that receive multi-year EU funding will continue to get cash from the Treasury after the UK leaves.</p> <p>The rest of it was an upbeat assessment of the UK\u2019s economic prospects and a brave (but unsuccessful) attempt to make the productivity challenge sound interesting.</p> <p>Still, one senses that Theresa May does not approve of meretricious conference grandstanding. Being a bit pedestrian was probably what helped Hammond get the job of chancellor, and there is a lot to be said for avoiding the kind of flash policy announcements that can fall apart within hours. If you take the view that dull and boring is good in policymaking, then I suppose this was a triumph.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T12:44:35.870Z\">at 1.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f23e3ee4b0ab0063087689\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:17:35.106Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hammond is on his peroration.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When future generations look back on our decision in 2016\u2026</p> <p>\u2026they will see not the end of an era\u2026</p> <p>\u2026but the beginning of a new age...</p> <p>\u2026not a country turning inward\u2026</p> <p>\u2026but a nation reaching out\u2026</p> <p>\u2026decisively, confidently to grasp new opportunities.</p> <p>A bigger, better, Greater Britain.</p> <p>Truly, a country that works for everyone.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f23e17e4b05962fdf4a682\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:16:51.014Z\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>He says the Tories must \u201cresolve to tackle the challenges we face at home with renewed vigour\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T12:45:01.836Z\">at 1.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f23df5e4b05962fdf4a681\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:16:14.993Z\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hammond is back on Brexit.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are going to leave the European Union.</p> <p>To repatriate our laws.</p> <p>To assert the supremacy of our courts.</p> <p>To control our borders.</p> <p>But we are not going to turn our backs on the nations of Europe.</p> <p>Let us resolve that as we leave their Union\u2026</p> <p>\u2026we will remain the best of neighbours\u2026</p> <p>\u2026the closest of trade associates\u2026</p> <p>\u2026the strongest of security partners.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f23d99e4b05962fdf4a67c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:15:23.284Z\">12.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>But Hammond says he is also promoting a similar initiative for the Midlands - the Midlands engine.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Midlands Engine, with its hub here in Birmingham, powers 11.7 million lives\u2026</p> <p>\u2026generates \u00a3220 billion of Added Value to the economy\u2026.</p> <p>\u2026.produces 18 percent of UK goods exports\u2026.</p> <p>\u2026.and more than a fifth of UK manufacturing output.</p> <p>In this great region, there are 320,000 more people in work than there were in 2010.</p> <p>But both productivity and economic growth have lagged behind the UK average.</p> <p>So we have developed our Long Term Economic Plan for the Midlands.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f23d4be4b05962fdf4a67b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:13:58.260Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hammond says he remains committed to the northern powerhouse, Osborne\u2019s initiative to revive the economy around Manchester.

But in this morning\u2019s interview she did not go as far as she did in the summer, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-uk-leaves-the-eu-36940775\">when she suggested the House of Lords should block Brexit legislation.</a></p> <p>Wheatcroft\u2019s summer interview prompted this outburst from the Open Democracy founder <strong>Anthony Barnett. </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Everything that is disgustingly cosy, self-regarding, privileged, corrupt and unaccountable about the way Britain is governed is represented by the House of Lords. The idea that it should claim a right to override the <em>hoi polloi</em>, shows a complete failure to understand what has happened.</p> </blockquote> <p>Barnett\u2019s Blimey, it could be Brexit! was one of the best accounts of the EU referendum and now <a href=\"https://unbound.com/books/brexit\">he is crowdfunding a follow up called What Next.</a> The Wheatcroft quote is from <a href=\"https://unbound.com/books/brexit/excerpt\">the introduction that he has already published.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f209e3e4b05962fdf4a572\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T08:17:37.093Z\">9.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hammond's morning interviews - Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Philip Hammond</strong>, the chancellor, has given a series of interviews this morning. </p> <p>Often at party conference it is the job of the chancellor, or shadow chancellor, to deliver the bad news. This morning Hammond duly obliged.</p> <p>Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Hammond said the economy would go through a period of \u201cturbulence\u201d during the Brexit negotiation process.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We must expect some turbulence as we go through this negotiating process. There will be a period of a couple of years or perhaps even longer when businesses are uncertain about the final state of our relationship with the European Union ...</p> <p>We have to expect a period when confidence will go up and down - perhaps on a bit of a rollercoaster - until we get to a final agreement, where businesses and consumers can understand what the future relationship between Britain and the European Union will be.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that, although the economy was doing well at the moment, there was a danger that business uncertainty would lead to investment drying up.</strong> Asked to rate the state of the economy on a scale of one to 10, and when it was put to him that the UK might deserve a five or a six, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Oh, I think we are better than that. From the data we\u2019ve seen from the first half of this year, this economy is running at eight out of 10, with high employment, strong growth, robust fundamentals.</p> </blockquote> <p>But he said that there was some evidence that trouble was looming.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Anecdotally we hear of businesses postponing investment decisions. And if we don\u2019t do something, if we don\u2019t intervene to counteract that effect, in time that would have an impact on jobs and growth. And it is to make sure that we can intervene to deal with that situation that we need to push back the target for fiscal balance.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he was abandoning the plan to get the budget in surplus by 2019-20 because he had to be ready to spend more to support the economy during this period of uncertainty.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As we go into a period when inevitably there will be more uncertainty in the British economy, we need to have the space to be able to support the economy through that period. But we need to do that within a context that makes very clear that we will balance that budget, we will get back to a position of fiscal sustainability.</p> </blockquote> <p>There was a case for \u201ctargeted, high-value investment in our economic infrastructure\u201d, he said. He said investment in infrastructure would create jobs in the short term, and make Britain more efficient in the long term.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He rejected claims that he was now adopting Labour\u2019s approach. </strong>He claimed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s economic policies were \u201cludicrous\u201d.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve heard some very irresponsible proposals from Labour and we heard last week some ludicrous suggestions about borrowing vast amounts of money. And we know from experience that the Labour party, if it were ever entrusted with government, would not be spending this money on the most productive forms of investment.</p> </blockquote> <p>When it was put to him that, although he might not be adopting Corbyn\u2019s policies, he was echoing what Ed Balls was saying before the general election, he also rejected that claim - although less convincingly. Told he sounded like Balls, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I hope I\u2019m sounding like a Conservative pragmatist faced with a challenge of uncertainty in the economy, wanting to ensure that we support the British economy through that period.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government was still accepted the assumption that Brexit would lower growth.</strong> Asked about an Institute for Fiscal Studies prediction that it would lower growth by 4%, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That is, despite the good economic data that we have had, still the central prediction of economic forecasters, that overall leaving the European Union will have a negative effect on economic growth ... That\u2019s the central prediction of economic forecasters and we have to take what they say seriously. </p> </blockquote> <p>But the prediction did not involve a \u201cone-off hit\u201d to the economy, he said. It was a forecast for what might happen over 15 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b68d26b724fddd956438272795eede1928cea7da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b68d26b724fddd956438272795eede1928cea7da/0_162_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Hammond and his wife Susan Williams-Walker at the Conservative conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Hammond and his wife Susan Williams-Walker at the Conservative conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f207f5e4b05962fdf4a568\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/graemewearden\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T07:26:30.719Z\">8.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pound falls as City faces up to hard Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Brexit worries have pushed the pound back towards the 31-year lows plumbed in the aftermath of June\u2019s referendum.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling\">Sterling</a> has lost over half a cent in early trading, dropping to \u00a31.2902 against the US dollar.

She looked more eager than most to be on her journey to Europe, as a transparent raincoat fell over her face.</p> <p>A photograph of the girl, one of the most striking to come out of the refugee crisis, won a <a href=\"http://www.worldpressphoto.org/\" title=\"\">World Press Photo</a> award in the People category. However, its creator, Matic Zorman \u2013 a Slovenian photographer \u2013 didn\u2019t make a note of her name. And now he wants to find her.</p> <p>\u201cI did not want to disrupt her so I did not talk to her,\u201d he says. \u201c[I didn\u2019t notice] the raincoat which fell over and covered her face as I pressed the shutter, I just walked further to the entrance of the registration centre to get a wider image of the area.\u201d It was only later that he noticed that she was \u201cseemingly suffocating\u201d and that the image symbolised the struggle endured by so many refugees.</p> <p>Mr Zorman has covered the refugee crisis since 2014, spending months at a time on the road, but this image always haunts him. \u201cI always return to the main question \u2013 what is her name and where is she?\u201d he says.</p> <p>Now, the 29 year old is appealing to the Serbian authorities and NGOs working on the border that day to come forward and help him in his search. He acknowledges that her family \u201cmight not be happy with the exposure\u201d, but feels that it\u2019s wrong to leave the image as a \u201cpassive document of the refugee crisis\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe World Press Photo award changed my life,\u201d says Zorman, \u201cbut frankly, what about hers? Where is she now? I want to channel the attention the image received, into an opportunity to give her a voice of her own that could speak louder than the image.\u201d</p> <p>So far, his appeal has been fruitless. Zorman says he will keep looking. \u201cThe end of each story depends on where you stop it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I hope for is to do a positive story about her current situation. After all she has gone through, I think I owe here that.\u201d</p> <p><em>Can you help find the girl?

  "<p>The pound has sunk to a three-year low against the euro on worries over the UK\u2019s prospects outside the EU, after the government set a timetable for Brexit negotiations and fanned fears it would go for a deal that leaves Britain excluded from the single market.</p> <p>Sterling came under pressure on Monday after Theresa May used her weekend speech at the Conservative party conference to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">pledge to trigger article 50 before the end of March</a>. The prime minister raised the possibility of a hard Brexit as she spelled out that greater border controls would trump any attempt to remain a member of the single market.</p> <p>That pushed the pound down sharply against the euro single currency to \u20ac1.1438 in afternoon trading, a drop of 0.9% on the day. The pound was also down more than 1% against the US dollar to $1.2835, not far off a 31-year low hit in the wake of June\u2019s shock referendum result.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-03T13:00:14/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-03T13:00:14/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Sterling\u2019s weakness contrasted with a rally on stock markets where share prices were lifted by a combination of near-term economic optimism, relief over May providing some certainty on Brexit timing and the effects of a weak pound, which flatters the earnings of UK-listed firms reporting in dollars.</p> <p>\u201cBrexit continues to be the word of the day, with the markets somewhat caught between the future consequences of Britain\u2019s separation from the EU and the lack of discernible impact in the past few months,\u201d said Connor Campbell, analyst at the financial spread betting firm Spreadex.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the FTSE is celebrating the UK\u2019s recent, and unexpected, economic sturdiness, the pound has its eye on a time when Britain officially no longer belongs to the European Union.\u201d</p> <p>The FTSE 100 index of bluechip shares rose more than 1% to a 16-month high of 6,996.</p> <p></p> <p>The more domestically focused FTSE 250 was also up, by 1.6% at 18,152, boosted by a surge in the shares of Henderson, the fund manager, which announced a merger with the asset manager Janus. Henderson shares were up 17% at 271p.</p> <p>The mood was further bolstered by a poll of manufacturers that suggested factory activity expanded at the fastest pace for more than two years in September, helped by stronger export orders on the back of the pound\u2019s fall after the EU referendum.

The Finding of Moses has not been displayed in the UK for more than a century, and the portrait of L\u00f6wenstam, which had remained with the engraver\u2019s descendants, has never been in a public exhibition.</p> <p>The show opens in the artist\u2019s native city of Leeuwarden, the capital of Friesland, which will take over the title of European capital of culture in 2018. The city\u2019s spectacular new museum has an important collection of his work, including many donations from his family, but because so much of it was sold in the US and the UK, he is almost unknown there.</p> <p>The London exhibition, from July 2017, will be in the studio home of his friend and fellow artist Lord Leighton, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/subsites/museums/leightonhousemuseum1.asp\">which is now a museum</a>. Its spectacular Arab-inspired interiors were rivalled by the sumptuous London homes Alma-Tadema created with his second wife, the artist Laura Epps. They fell in love when she was 17 and he was 34. He settled permanently in London from 1870, and was knighted by Queen Victoria. The couple\u2019s first home was destroyed when a barge full of sugar and gunpowder blew up on the nearby Regent\u2019s canal \u2013 a scene of devastation <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/arts/pictures/image/0,8543,-10104514616,00.html\">recorded in a photograph</a>  \u2013 but they moved to an even larger house, where his agent grumbled that Alma-Tadema spent too much time on interior decorating rather than painting.</p> <p>Even at the height of his fame, his temples, palaces and Roman maidens lolling on marble benches were not to every taste: the critic John Ruskin, a passionate advocate of the very different work of JMW Turner, described Alma-Tadema as \u201cthe worst painter of the 19th century\u201d. </p> <p>He died in 1912, and fell so out of fashion that in the 1960s The Finding of Moses was cut out and rolled up when a gallery could only find a buyer for the elaborate frame. But he was revered by generations of filmmakers and designers \u2013 the exhibition traces his influence from the first silent movies up to Ridley Scott\u2019s 2000 film Gladiator. Scott\u2019s production designer, Arthur Max, who attended the exhibition opening, recalled that the team worked with a sheaf of reproductions of Alma-Tadema paintings.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c0c8330672d162d485d9b78c6f60df3a3ce3e15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c0c8330672d162d485d9b78c6f60df3a3ce3e15/515_598_2767_1660/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alma-Tadema\u2019s painting of his engraver Leopold L\u00f6wenstam at the Fries Museum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alma-Tadema\u2019s painting of his engraver Leopold L\u00f6wenstam at the Fries Museum.

The wealthy English and American buyers loved his work because they saw themselves as the new Romans \u2013 but they missed the fact that he also portrayed the darkness and corruption of that world.\u201d</p> <p>His auction prices had been rising steadily, but jaws dropped in 2010 when The Finding of Moses went for $35.9m (\u00a322m) \u2013 seven times the highest pre-sale estimate \u2013 at a Sotheby\u2019s sale in New York.

Afghans constituted the second-largest group of asylum seekers in Europe, with <a href=\"https://www.easo.europa.eu/sites/default/files/public/EN_%20Annual%20Report%202015_1.pdf\">196,170 applying</a> last year.</p> <p>While the text stipulates a maximum of 50 non-voluntary deportees per chartered flight in the first six months after the agreement, there is no limit to the number of daily deportation flights European governments can charter to Kabul.</p> <p>With tens of thousands set to be deported, both sides will also consider building a terminal dedicated to deportation flights at Kabul international airport.</p> <p>The agreement, Joint Way Forward, also opens up the deportation of women and children, which at the moment almost exclusively happens from Norway: \u201cSpecial measures will ensure that such vulnerable groups receive adequate protection, assistance and care throughout the whole process.\u201d</p> <p>If family members in Afghanistan cannot be located, unaccompanied children can be returned only with \u201cadequate reception and care-taking arrangement having been put in place in Afghanistan\u201d, the text says.</p> <p>The EU has negotiated the agreement with the Afghan government as part of the run-up to this week\u2019s Brussels donor conference, where international donors will pledge aid for Afghanistan for the coming four years. Some Afghan officials seem to have felt strong-armed.

She added that there had been little transparency in the negotiation process.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been no oversight, no consultation, and hardly any mention of it to any of the migrant organisations or rights organisations [in Europe]. There was no chance to mount resistance against it,\u201d Schuster said.</p> <p>The large exodus of Afghans last year seemed partly triggered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/08/refugee-crisis-germany-creaks-under-strain-of-open-door-policy\">Angela Merkel opening Germany\u2019s doors to almost a million migrants</a>, but it also coincided with a deteriorating security situation, which has not improved since.</p> <p>On Sunday, the Taliban mounted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/taliban-launches-major-assault-on-afghan-city-of-kunduz\">strong assault</a> on the northern city of Kunduz, while attacks have also increased in many other parts of the country.</p> <p>To prevent a migrant flow of the size experienced last year, the deal commits the EU to help fund public awareness campaigns in Afghanistan warning against the dangers of migrating.</p> <p>However, not all Afghan asylum seekers arrive to Europe from Afghanistan. An unknown number were born or grew up in Iran or Pakistan. If sent to Afghanistan, many are likely to struggle without the social networks that are often a prerequisite to getting work, even for the well-educated. According to Schuster, who has authored a <a href=\"http://migration.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/05/08/migration.mns011\">paper on post-deportation experience</a>, destitute people, who do not choose to leave Afghanistan again immediately after deportation, could be ripe targets for recruitment not only by the Taliban but local strongmen commanding militias.

For that reason he was clear the referendum vote regained control over Britain\u2019s borders and courts, but could not be a deterministic influence on immigration. <br></p> <p>He also explained that Brexit meant abandoning Osborne\u2019s pursuit of a balanced budget by 2020.

But this is a false distinction; women who are already on the move are often just as vulnerable, just as entitled to protection, as those in refugee camps far away.</p> <p>Obviously the wider crises in which these women are caught up need bigger shifts in resources and interventions than the UK government can manage alone. But that is not to say that our leaders can\u2019t play some constructive part in building a safer world.</p> <p>Our prime minister and our home secretary, uniquely in our country\u2019s history, are both women. If they could find it in their hearts to listen to what women on the other side of fortune are passing through right now, they might understand why current policy is so unworkable and inhumane.</p> <p>It\u2019s unworkable because it places an impossible burden on the countries where people enter Europe, and leads to chaos at the borders. It\u2019s inhumane because by refusing to set up any safe routes for women like these, our policy leaves them and their children in a twilight world. Destitution and danger become commonplace, and violence against them goes unpunished. The legacy of that violence can be heard in the stories of every woman I\u2019ve spoken to in Calais.</p> <p>Observers are often puzzled why these women are not claiming asylum in France rather than living in limbo, hoping to cross to the UK. For many women there, it is because the only family members they have \u2013 the fathers of their children, in some cases, or brothers, sisters, parents \u2013 are in the UK. One woman I met has lived in Calais for months with her four-year-old daughter, because her husband is in the UK and she cannot give up hope of reuniting the family.</p> <p>At the end of the day, are we really so scared of these women, that we would block their attempts to seek safety here, and deny them any help in rebuilding their lives? Helen, the woman who made it through the Sahara and Libya, did in the end make it out of Calais and into the UK by climbing into a lorry at night. She has now claimed asylum, and if she is successful in settling here, she wants to become a nurse. I dearly hope that she is able to fulfil her dreams, and that we can find ways to help more women like her to rebuild their lives and reclaim their dignity.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Names have been changed</em></p>",

  "<p>I started out working as a restaurant kitchen-hand when I was a teenager, before getting trained up as a chef on the job. So by the time I arrived at uni, I had a score of recipes in my back pocket. </p> <p>My flatmates would generally rip into me for doing slightly cheffy things, such as cooking salmon with fresh parsley \u2013 but they\u2019d change their tune when they wanted a Christmas dinner. </p> <p>If you\u2019re a bit ropey in the kitchen, it\u2019s worth practising before you have too much coursework, so here are a few tips guaranteed to keep you alive until your January exams:</p> <h2><strong>Keep it simple</strong></h2> <p>Let\u2019s face it, you\u2019ll never use a slow cooker. Or a hand blender. Or an electric whisk. Dispense with gizmos the weight of pavement slabs; they\u2019re all pointless for the average undergrad. As Megan Webb, who studies teaching at Bath Spa University, puts it: \u201cThe piece of kitchen equipment I used the most was a pair of scissors, to open all the packaging on my many new appliances.\u201d</p> <p>You\u2019ll be better off stocking up on the basics, like one or two pots and pans \u2013 plus food staples such as tinned tomatoes, frozen veg, rice and pasta \u2013 rather than loads of cumbersome equipment.</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t bother with books</strong></h2> <p>This hardly needs saying, but it\u2019s 2016: the sensible ports of call for your culinary inspiration are places like <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/\">BBC Good Food</a>, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.jamieoliver.com/\">jamieoliver.com</a>, and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://uk.pinterest.com/\">Pinterest</a>. </p> <p>Housemates, especially international housemates, can be another great source of interesting recipes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/30/vegetarian-chilli-recipe-beans-pulses-anna-jones-the-modern-cook-student\">Anna Jones\u2019 quick and easy recipes for beans and pulses | The modern cook</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>The freezer is your friend</strong></h2> <p>In my first year I lived with a housemate who would bulk-buy vacuum-packed chicken breasts on the internet at a huge discount, only to end up throwing a third of them away because they wouldn\u2019t all fit in his drawer in the communal freezer. </p> <p>It was a good idea, poorly executed \u2013 but I was inspired. Thinking forward in chunks of a week to 10 days is the best way to ensure you don\u2019t waste food and money. </p> <p>Amy Donaghy, a psychology student at York, can testify to that. \u201cAfter a long day of lectures, the last thing I ever wanted to do was start cooking from scratch. You\u2019ll be thankful for those extra portions you froze last week,\u201d she says.</p> <h2>Vitamins aren\u2019t expensive</h2> <p>It\u2019s true that you can live very cheaply on a diet of processed, orangey-beige food. But it\u2019s equally easy to keep costs low and have a more nutritional diet. Rachel Cou\u00e9, who studies sociology at the University of Chester, says: \u201cCinnamon rolls might be \u00a32 but bananas are \u00a31.70. Eating healthy keeps your mum and your bank account happy \u2013 which is a double bonus if they\u2019re the same thing.\u201d</p> <p>Think about which ingredients will go a long way. A punnet of mushrooms or a bag of red peppers might seem like a bit of a waste of your money and time when you can choose from aisles of two-for-one ready meals, but if you make healthy ingredients go far \u2013 a bolognese becomes a chilli, a fajita filling tomorrow\u2019s curry \u2013 the cost levels out.</p> <h2><strong>Experiment and enjoy</strong></h2> <p>Want to try making an authentic chicken fried rice in the early hours? No-one\u2019s going to stop you, except maybe the person whose room backs on to the extractor fan. But ignore them. Trying new tastes while cooking for yourself is the best way to stop your meals becoming a chore.</p> <p>Washing-up in a shared kitchen is, on the other hand, less fun. Wash up as you go along, and cook using as few pans as possible.</p> <h2><strong>My easy veg curry recipe</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f672ede4ff6ee4b56d93a1381b0021922712eafe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f672ede4ff6ee4b56d93a1381b0021922712eafe/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"My six-ingredient, six-step fruity tikka masala with basmati rice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">My six-ingredient, six-step fruity tikka masala with basmati rice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Owen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This vegetarian curry couldn\u2019t get much simpler, and it\u2019s full of healthy ingredients that make for a flavoursome and balanced meal.

  "<p> A bid to give the highest level of international legal protection to all African elephants was defeated on Monday at a global wildlife summit. </p> <p>The EU played a pivotal role in blocking the proposal, which was fought over by rival groups of African nations.</p> <p> But the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), meeting this week in Johannesburg, passed other new measures for elephants that conservationists say will add vital protection. </p> <p> All 182 nations agreed for the first time that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/02/worlds-nations-agree-elephant-ivory-markets-must-close\">legal ivory markets within nations must be closed</a>. Separately, a process that could <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37479072\">allow one-off sales of ivory stockpiles was killed</a> and tougher measures to deal with nations failing to control poached ivory were agreed. </p> <p> More than 140,000 of Africa\u2019s savannah elephants were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/12/elephants-on-the-path-to-extinction-the-facts\">killed for their ivory</a> between 2007 and 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/poaching-drives-huge-30-decline-in-africas-savannah-elephants\">wiping out almost a third of their population</a>, and one elephant is still being killed by poachers every 15 minutes on average. The price of ivory has soared threefold since 2009, leading conservationists to fear the survival of the species is at risk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/poaching-drives-huge-30-decline-in-africas-savannah-elephants\">Poaching drives huge 30% decline in Africa's savannah elephants</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The acrimonious debate over elephant poaching has split African countries. Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, which host about a third of all remaining elephants, have stable or increasing populations. They argue passionately that elephant numbers are also suffering from loss of habitat and killings by farmers and that they can only be protected by making money from ivory sales and trophy hunting.</p> <p> However, a <a href=\"https://www.africanelephantcoalition.org/\">group of 29 African nations</a>, which host about 40% of all elephants and are led by Kenya and Benin, have smaller and plummeting populations and countered that poaching and the illegal trade in ivory is the greatest threat.</p> <p> Most African elephants already have the highest level of international legal protection \u2013 a Cites \u201cappendix 1\u201d listing \u2013 which bans all trade. But the elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana, are listed on \u201cappendix 2\u201d, a lower level of protection. On Monday a proposal to add the elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana to appendix 1 was defeated. </p> <p> Critics said the proposal would do little to protect elephants as all international trade is already banned, but proponents argued it was a crucial signal to poachers and criminals of a global crackdown on the illegal ivory trade. Botswana has the world\u2019s largest elephant population, about a third of all elephants, and it is growing. But it broke ranks with Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe and argued vehemently for appendix 1 protection.</p> <p>Tshekedi Khama, Botswana\u2019s minister of environment, said: \u201cThere is concerning evidence that elephant poaching is moving south. The criminal networks that facilitate much of this trade are highly organised and fluid, operating over several regions in the continent. Therefore no population should be considered secure. Put simply, a threat to elephants anywhere is a threat to elephants everywhere.\u201d</p> <p> The Cote D\u2019Ivoire delegate said it was absurd to have some elephants on appendix 1 and some on appendix 2: \u201cAn elephant that crosses a border may have protection on one side and not on the other. Elephants do not have passports.\u201d</p> <p>Lee White, the British-born director of Gabon\u2019s national parks and Cites delegate, said poachers were now shooting on sight at his rangers. The upgrading of all elephants to the highest protection would have sent \u201ca signal that we will come down as hard on poaching as we do on the trafficking of drugs, arms and people\u201d.</p> <p> However, Namibia\u2019s delegate threatened to withdraw entirely from Cites protections for elephants if the all populations were upgraded the highest levels. \u201cIt is completely fallacious that legal ivory trade covers illegal trade,\u201d he said, a statement flatly rejected by other nations. </p> <p>South Africa\u2019s environment minister, Edna Molewa, said rural communities must benefit from elephants if they are to tolerate the damage caused to crops and the lives sometimes lost. \u201cWe dare not ignore their voices,\u201d she said. \u201cTrophy hunting is the best return on investment [in elephant protection] with the least impact.\u201d</p> <p>The EU, which with 28 votes is a powerful force at Cites, also opposed the upgrade to appendix 1. It said that Cites rules meant the highest level protection is reserved for populations that are in steep decline, and that this did not apply to the elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana. </p> <p>Some scientific and conservation groups agreed with this, including WWF, Traffic and the Zoological Society of London, arguing the integrity of the Cites was at risk.</p> <p> The EU delegate to Cites said: \u201cThe proposal does not meet the biological criteria. [But] this does not mean in any way we are not concerned about the decline of elephants across the continent.\u201d Several nations said cutting the demand for ivory, through education, and better enforcement against poachers were key. </p> <p> The issue was forced to a vote and was defeated, leaving the southern African elephants on appendix 2. Earlier on Monday, Namibia and Zimbabwe had attempted to legalise the trade in ivory from those countries.</p> <p> Namibia said its elephant population had doubled to 20,000 in the last 15 years. Charles Jonga, from the Campfire Programme, a rural development group in Zimbabwe, told the Cites summit: \u201cThe people in my community say: \u2018These elephants they eat our crops, they damage our houses, what benefit do we get?\u2019 If they get benefits, they will protect and not poach.\u201d </p> <p> But Patrick Omondi, Kenya\u2019s delegate, said: \u201cPoaching levels and trafficking in ivory are at their highest peak. History has shown the ivory trade cannot be controlled. We are reaching a tipping point and need to give elephants time to recover.\u201d</p> <p> Both Namibia\u2019s and Zimbabwe\u2019s proposals, supported by Japan but opposed by the EU and US, were soundly defeated. Observers believe Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa did not expect to unpick the ban on the ivory trade at this summit, but wanted to keep the debate open, in the hope of future success. Another proposal, from Swaziland, to legalise the trade in its rhino horn was heavily defeated. </p> <p>Many conservation groups wanted all elephants to get the highest protection, but Tom Milliken, an elephant expert from wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic, said<strong tabindex=\"-1\">: </strong>\u201cWhere elephants fall on the Cites appendices is inconsequential to their survival. All the paper protection in the world is not going to compensate for poor law enforcement, rampant corruption and ineffective management.\u201d </p> <p>He said the real success of the summit were measures to crack down on countries failing to halt illegal trade.</p> <p>But Kelvin Alie, at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said the failure to put all elephants on appendix one was a disaster: \u201cThis is a tragedy for elephants. At a time when we are seeing such a dramatic increase in the slaughter of elephants for ivory, now was the time for the global community to step up and say no more.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A suspected drug smuggler plunged to his death from the mast of a yacht as it was being searched by border force officers in the Isles of Scilly, an inquest has heard.</p> <p>Christiaan Woestenburg, whose boat had been towed into harbour by lifeboat charity the RNLI, told officers he was going to fetch some equipment to open a locked hatch on the yacht, Windrose. </p> <p>But Dutch-born Woestenburg, 62, climbed up the 12-metre-high (40ft) mast of the yacht before apparently jumping onto the granite quay of St Mary\u2019s harbour. </p> <p>An inquest jury in Plymouth in Devon was told the 11-metre (36ft) Windrose was in the Atlantic heading to Holland when it suffered problems with its rigging and mast 16 miles off Scilly. </p> <p>Woestenburg called out the St Mary\u2019s lifeboat on Sunday 16 June 2013 after three days without sleep. When the border force heard where the vessel was they sent a cutter to St Mary\u2019s and boarded the yacht searching for hidden drugs. </p> <p>Woestenburg\u2019s younger brother, Otto, said his sibling was an experienced sailor who had made several transatlantic voyages. He said he had bought the yacht in Turkey in 2009 and had sailed to South America and the Dutch Caribbean several times.</p> <p>He said he had seen reports that a \u201cvery large\u201d amount of drugs was found on the boat, but he said: \u201cI cannot believe that he would have tried to smuggle drugs. His friends are in shock and disbelief. He was, in fact, anti-drugs.\u201d He said Woestenburg lived frugally and gave generously to charity. </p> <p> St Mary\u2019s assistant harbour master, Alan Hartwell, told the jury the skipper had been at sea for 15 days and away from home for four years. Hartwell said: \u201cHe looked completely shattered. He said it was the worst trip he had.\u201d</p> <p>Home Office forensic pathologist Dr Russell Delaney said Woestenburg had been sailing from Portugal and was believed to be heading to Holland.</p> <p>He said: \u201cHe was towed to the Isles of Scilly by the RNLI. The boat was tied to a mooring in the harbour. Border Force received some intelligence and the boat was boarded and searched.\u201d</p> <p>Delaney said there was a secured hatch down below and the yachtsman passed officers to go to the deck to fetch hydraulic equipment to open it.</p> <p>Once on deck he climbed the mast. \u201cHe then jumped off the top and landed on the solid granite harbourside,\u201d said Delaney. The pathologist said he landed on the quayside. An off-duty paramedic came to his aid and he was airlifted to Truro on the mainland where he was declared dead. </p> <p>Delaney said his postmortem revealed the yachtsman died from head, chest and pelvic injuries that were consistent with a fall from height.</p> <p>He added: \u201cHe was immediately unconscious and unaware of what happened. The head injury was unsurviveable.\u201d There was no evidence he had been forcefully restrained. </p> <p>Blood tests showed Woestenburg was slightly over the drink-drive limit and the pathologist said this may have \u201caffected his decision-making but he was not incapacitated by it\u201d. <br></p> <p>The jurors were told that a \u201clarge quantity of class A drugs\u201d was found on board.

  "<p>For Jamie Oliver, a man used to politicians beating a path to his door, it must have been a rude awakening. Not only did Theresa May\u2019s new administration<strong> </strong>delete all the juiciest bits from the child obesity strategy<strong> </strong>he had championed, but when the celebrity chef protested, the door unceremoniously shut in his face. \u201cHer people have locked down all communications,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-09-23/jamie-oliver-ive-nothing-nice-to-say-to-theresa-may\">Oliver plaintively told the Radio Times</a>.</p> <p>If it is any consolation, much of Westminster knows the feeling. There are, says one regular visitor, \u201csome seriously good people in there\u201d, but the new No 10 operation is rolling down the shutters.</p> <p>The days of kitchen suppers, old-school ties and being godparents to each other\u2019s children are over, with Downing Street briskly emptied of Cameron\u2019s \u201cchums\u201d. But May is building an inner circle in some ways equally closed to those who don\u2019t have the prime minister\u2019s trust. It is just that, in May\u2019s case, trust tends to be forged professionally, whereas, for Cameron, it often stemmed from friendships dating back to Eton or Oxford. That may have seemed normal to Cameron, having grown up in the kind of upper-middle-class English circle where everyone seemingly knows everyone, but it certainly isn\u2019t to May\u2019s people.</p> <p>The new tribe is more practical, more provincial \u2013 rooted in Birmingham and Bexley, not Notting Hill and Chipping Norton \u2013 and markedly less posh, bonding as beleaguered young party workers in the Tory wilderness years rather than at jolly country house weddings. (Even their salaries are said to have been capped at relatively frugal levels, and far from looking forward to OBEs, one insider jokes that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/06/why-has-david-camerons-honours-list-caused-such-a-fuss\">the fuss over Cameron\u2019s resignation honours list</a> means they will probably be \u201clucky to get a cup of tea and a biscuit\u201d when they leave.) The overall vibe is distinctively more \u201cdoers\u201d than schmoozers. What is intriguing is how far their personal experiences overlap with May\u2019s political agenda of focusing on what she calls the \u201cjust managing\u201d \u2013 people who are working but not wealthy, who know how it feels to be on the outside of well-connected and comfortable elites, and are drawn to meritocratic ideas.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.totalpolitics.com/articles/news/pr-boss-katie-perrior-theresa-mays-top-spin-doctor\">Katie Perrior</a>, Downing Street\u2019s new director of communications, is a case in point. When she began working as May\u2019s press officer in the early 00s, Tory offices were still filled with faintly Sloaney \u201cgirls in pearls\u201d; with her south London accent and down-to-earth manner, Perrior stood out from the start. But though she may have orgnised raucous karaoke nights at party conferences, woe betide anyone who understimates her serious side. She served as a Tory councillor in suburban south London in her spare time, and nine years ago started up her own PR business with fellow Tory aide Jo Tanner. (Ignoring warnings from male rivals in a cut-throat industry that \u201cyou girls\u201d would flounder, they promptly bagged a contract for Boris Johnson\u2019s 2008 mayoral campaign, giving her a useful inside track to the now foreign secretary).</p> <p>Perrior\u2019s appointment is a sign of May\u2019s emphasis on proven practical skills but, crucially, also on loyalty, given that she is one of several longstanding allies who dropped everything at short notice in June to help with May\u2019s leadership campaign. But it is the very devotion of the prime minister\u2019s inner circle that makes some uneasy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3967db7218e3049ad20aafde0479ab66068d9ad9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3967db7218e3049ad20aafde0479ab66068d9ad9/0_0_2123_1428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiona Hill, joint chief of staff, seemingly a key confidante when May has to make a decision.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fiona Hill, joint chief of staff, seemingly a key confidante when May has to make a decision.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Back/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Power in the new regime is centralised in the hands of May\u2019s formidable joint chiefs of staff, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/15/may-appoints-former-advisers-as-joint-chiefs-of-staff\">Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill</a>, both famed for being, as one ex-colleague puts it, \u201chard as nails\u201d in ensuring her writ runs across Whitehall. Everything is funnelled through them and directions then come back down from the top, a change from Cameron\u2019s more open style, according to one former staffer: \u201cHe\u2019d ask us for ideas. He\u2019d say to the policy unit: \u2018This is the problem. What are we going to do?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The pair are also overseeing a systematic review of policy decisions across government, methodically stripping everything back to the bones. \u201cWhat people in government are saying is that it\u2019s almost like a change of government, having to go back to basics and take people through stuff,\u201d says Jill Rutter, programme director at the thinktank <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/\">Institute for Government</a>. \u201cEverything is being radically re-examined from first principles.\u201d</p> <p>It is the way May has always operated \u2013 Timothy and Hill were meticulous in spotting potential elephant traps at the Home Office, where they both worked for her, along with their deputy Jo Penn and deputy head of the policy unit Will Tanner \u2013 and arguably closer to the way things worked under Thatcher and Major. But there are ripples of alarm about the power it places in Timothy\u2019s hands particularly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c707f38c8cf62b5fca9f8314b6dca2d125454c84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c707f38c8cf62b5fca9f8314b6dca2d125454c84/0_167_1908_1144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joint chief of staff Nick Timothy, the primer mover in bringing back the 11-plus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joint chief of staff Nick Timothy, the primer mover in bringing back the 11-plus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nicknamed \u201cRasputin\u201d, the bearded steelworker\u2019s son has been identified as the prime mover in decisions from pausing the Hinkley Point power plant deal to bringing back the 11-plus. (A grammar school boy from Birmingham, he joined the Tories as a teenager after realising Labour opposed selection.) Crucially, he was also for leave in the EU referendum and, along with press secretary Lizzie Loudon \u2013 a former special adviser to Iain Duncan Smith, who joined No 10 from the leave campaign \u2013 brings an understanding of outers to discussions about Brexit.</p> <p>Hill, a serious-minded and ferociously hardworking ex-Sky News producer who grew up in Scotland, attracts less controversy, but her fingerprints were also evident in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/19/theresa-may-resists-calls-uk-accept-syrian-refugees-aid\">May\u2019s speech earlier this month on modern slavery</a>; Hill encouraged May to take up the issue at the Home Office, and then produced her own report on the issue for thinktank Centre for Social Justice before coming into Downing Street.</p> <p>The word in Whitehall is that May won\u2019t make decisions in front of officials but, instead, says one source, \u201cgoes away for an hour with Nick and Fiona and \u2013 boing! \u2013 a decision is made. Which is exactly like Gordon Brown. He\u2019d go away, and we all assumed Ed [Balls] then told him what to do.\u201d That may not be strictly fair, but the relationship between the three of them is certainly critical to everything May does.</p> <p>The other change that has set tongues wagging is the diminished influence of the Treasury. Only one key member of George Osborne\u2019s camp, special adviser Neil O\u2019Brien, made the leap to the new Downing Street team and, unlike Osborne, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, isn\u2019t invited to the agenda-setting daily morning meeting in No 10. As Rutter, herself a former Downing Street civil servant, points out, that is arguably just a return to the historic norm after years of unusually equal partnership between Cameron and Osborne.</p> <p>But May\u2019s preference for smaller, tighter, more formal circles of decision-making perhaps also reflects her personality. Cameron was a social animal, happy mixing personal with professional, and liked to chew both over with Osborne at the beginning and end of his working day. Tony Blair was relaxed enough to take briefings as he was changing between engagements, hopping around in his underpants while his aides reeled off bullet points.</p> <p>May, however, is reserved to the point of shyness, and likes to keep things businesslike. The nearest thing she has to an old chum in cabinet is the work and pensions secretary Damian Green, an Oxford contemporary whose wife Alicia was her student supervision partner, but even he had to earn his cabinet job on merit. Education secretary Justine Greening and home secretary Amber Rudd are both also personal allies, but that didn\u2019t stop May putting Greening \u2013 a proud comprehensive schoolgirl, leading a Department for Education that has until now been highly resistant to selection \u2013 in a difficult position over grammar schools. There is a brisk professionalism to this regime that comes from the top.</p> <p>Crucially, it\u2019s also a team forged in adversity. Hill, Timothy, Perrior and several other No 10 advisers earned their spurs as junior staffers under Duncan Smith at a time of civil war within the party; John Godfrey, the new director of the policy unit, was an unsuccessful parliamentary candidate in Scotland in the early 90s, hardly the easiest time or place to be a Tory. While many of Cameron\u2019s staff came on board in sunnier times, this lot are battle-hardened and their interests tend towards the gritty.</p> <p>Timothy\u2019s passion is industrial strategy, Godfrey specialises in pensions, housing and longterm care \u2013 while one of few survivors from the Cameron era, special adviser Sheridan Westlake, who famously persuaded Eric Pickles to focus on the unglamorous issues that suburban voters cared about, such as <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2395167/Eric-Pickles-calls-spaces-stop-wheelie-bins-cluttering-streets.html\">the Daily Mail obsession with wheelie bins</a>.</p> <p>While the Cameroons\u2019 house journal was the comfortably establishment Times, anxious Mail readers \u2013 more suburban than urban, less financially comfortable, more anxious and insecure about the future \u2013 are now setting the agenda.</p> <p>May gets on well personally with the paper\u2019s editor-in-chief, Paul Dacre, and often chooses the Mail on Sunday\u2019s political editor, Simon Walters, for interviews; she took Liz Sanderson, a former Mail on Sunday features writer turned special adviser, into No 10 where her job is to promote the prime minister\u2019s agenda via features pages and magazines not read by political junkies. That won\u2019t, however, mean opening up her jealously guarded private life. Unlike Samantha Cameron, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/12/philip-may-theresa-may-quiet-husband-city-experience\">May\u2019s financier husband, Philip</a>, is still working full time, and will be a supportive but largely invisible background presence. There is little chance of cameras being allowed into their private Downing Street flat \u2013 as happened when <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/samantha-cameron-s-dream-kitchen-is-the-lure-at-flat-next-door-to-no-10-a3293781.html\">Angela Merkel and Michelle Obama were photographed on Cameron\u2019s mustard-yellow sofa</a> \u2013 and the new regime is generally warier of the media. While Cameron counted journalists among his personal friends, May keeps them firmly at arm\u2019s length and expects her intimates to do the same. Even the celebrity count at No 10 functions or dinners at Chequers is likely to be lower, with a beady eye on the cost to taxpayers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"914ed61fe36ccc5810097814f5a54c79026bc7a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/914ed61fe36ccc5810097814f5a54c79026bc7a3/0_228_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Obama was invited for tea with Samantha Cameron No 11 \u2013 not the sort of photo opportunity that Theresa May is likely to repeat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michelle Obama was invited for tea with Samantha Cameron at No 11 \u2013 not the sort of photo opportunity that Theresa May is likely to repeat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And if the new Downing Street doesn\u2019t exactly sound like a barrel of laughs \u2013 well, as Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said when backing May for leader, these are serious times for serious people. Or to put it another way, the party\u2019s over, and that big black door is once again slowly clanging shut.</p> <h2>What has happened to the Cameroons?</h2> <p>Every cloud has a silver lining, and for sacked male politicians, it is no longer having to shave for the cameras. But after a summer of rebelliously cultivating beards (yes, that means you, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/aug/17/stylewatch-michael-gove-beard\">Michael Gove</a> and Ed Vaizey) and licking their wounds, the defeated Cameroons are starting to get back down to business.</p> <p>For some, that simply means getting their side of the story out. First, and suspiciously fast, off the blocks was former No 10 spin doctor Craig Oliver, with a book accusing Theresa May of repeatedly finding so many excuses to get out of campaigning publicly for remain that in Downing Street she was known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/brexit-books-david-cameron-theresa-may-party-split\">\u201csubmarine May\u201d</a>. Cameroon fingerprints are also evident in Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman\u2019s All Out War, in which unnamed sources accuse \u201clily-livered\u201d May of having privately counselled against pushing for tougher curbs on EU immigration at the last minute, claims denied by her camp. Ken Clarke, who sparred memorably and sometimes publicly with May in cabinet, also has a potentially awkward memoir out shortly \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/20/david-cameron-perfect-political-memoir-more-indiscretion-less-spin\">while Cameron is still negotiating a deal for his</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f876f311134f0ab9f5096e3c82905d10ffe4def\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f876f311134f0ab9f5096e3c82905d10ffe4def/0_376_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Clarke, whose potentially awkward memoir will be out shortly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ken Clarke, whose potentially awkward memoir will be out shortly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it is in parliament, not publishing, that the real battle looms. May\u2019s strategy of methodically reviewing almost every big decision made by Cameron, suggesting she plans a cleaner break with the past than expected, has galvanised his old set to defend what they see as his legacy.</p> <p>If nothing else, the referendum seems to have taught Cameroons of the importance of trying to build \u2013 or at least appear to build \u2013 popular grassroots movements behind them. Hence <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/15/george-osborne-launches-northern-powerhouse-thinktank-with-suppo/\">the thinktank George Osborne has just launched</a>, devoted to galvanising public support for his \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, a project viewed with some scepticism in the May camp. (Westminster is watching with interest the relationship between Downing Street special adviser Neil O\u2019Brien \u2013 a former aide to Osborne who helped devise the initiative \u2013 and May\u2019s chief of staff Nick Timothy, also keen to grow the economy beyond London but said to have doubts about focusing everything on the northwest).</p> <p>The former chancellor\u2019s speech in Chicago last week, warning that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/george-osborne-brexit-won-majority-hard-brexit-did-not\">Britain voted for Brexit but not for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d</a> \u2013 in other words, that there\u2019s no mandate for leaving the single market \u2013 was another warning shot. Tory remainers are grimly determined not to let leavers sidle away too easily from campaign promises that Britain could have its cake and eat it, somehow enjoying the benefits of single-market membership while refusing freedom of movement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74d6343a7e3c38eb639d0599239442a4c5ad9183\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74d6343a7e3c38eb639d0599239442a4c5ad9183/0_225_3500_2366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former education secretary Nicky Morgan will fight plans for new grammar schools\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former education secretary Nicky Morgan will fight plans for new grammar schools.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Ansell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Former education secretaries Gove and Nicky Morgan will focus on <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/09/theresa-may-every-school-in-england-will-be-given-opportunity-to/\">fighting back against planned new grammar schools</a> in parliament and the media.

They may no longer wield power. But influence? The impeccably connected, frantically networking Cameroons were always good at that.</p>",
  "<p>To understand why, despite the recent funeral orations, liberalism is very much alive, you have to go back to the 1860s and the abolition of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/slavery\" title=\"\">slavery</a> in two key countries. To be precise, 1863, when \u2013 in one of the great coincidences of history \u2013 the proclamations of liberty for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/01/emancipation-proclamation-self-liberation\" title=\"\">American slaves</a> and the Russian serfs came just five weeks apart.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/15/brexit-liberalism-post-liberal-age\">Brexit was a revolt against liberalism. We\u2019ve entered a new political era | Martin Kettle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both liberations were great victories for anti-slavery campaigners, more than half a century after the first successes of the campaign against the slave trade. But they were also great disappointments for radicals. Because, in both cases, the slaves and the serfs were catapulted from bondage into poverty.</p> <p>In the US, slavery was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/dec/09/obama-abolition-slavery-anniversary-bigotry\" title=\"\">replaced by peonage and debt bondage</a>. In Russia, the land was valued at three and a half times its market value, and the impoverished serfs had to pay this to their former owners over a period of 49 years. It became clear that it wasn\u2019t enough to release the slaves \u2013 you had to release them from debt, monopoly and the economic tyranny that replaced it.</p> <p>By then, the basic tenets of free trade had been set out by economists, but it was liberalism that turned it into a political objective. Richard Cobden, Liberal MP for Rochdale \u2013 the man most responsible for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1846/jun/27/mainsection.fromthearchive\" title=\"\">repeal of the corn laws</a> in 1846, allowing the price of bread to fall \u2013 knew that if you just set slaves free, they could then potentially be bound just as firmly by controlling where they could buy what they needed, or by putting them in debt.</p> <p>So the original idea of free trade was not a simple licence to do whatever you wanted, if you were rich and powerful enough. It was designed as a means of liberation \u2013 so that the small could challenge the big, the poor could challenge the rich with the power of a new approach, an alternative provider, an imaginative, liberating shift. It was an antidote to the old pattern that employers could control not just what you were paid, but also what you paid for the things you needed to live.</p> <p>But recent decades have seen this central liberal economic doctrine become its own opposite \u2013 permission for the rich to ride roughshod over the poor, an apologia for monopoly and an extractive discipline that prevents the all-important challenge from below. It became instead a potential tool of enslavement.</p> <p>Why? Because of what happened in the US as a result of Friedrich Hayek\u2019s 1944 attack on scientific central planning and his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_Serfdom\" title=\"\">manifesto for economic liberalism, The Road to Serfdom</a>, a hymn of praise to the idea that people needed to buy what they wanted, where they wanted \u2013 and that anything else was a recipe for tyranny.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57b42e0e3c173fee40d134c730313a07ab706253\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57b42e0e3c173fee40d134c730313a07ab706253/0_96_3664_2199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milton Friedman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milton Friedman\u2019s book Capitalism and Freedom marked the break between liberalism and neoliberalism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Rose/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The book was praised by John Maynard Keynes and George Orwell, yet its message \u2013 and Hayek\u2019s alliance with the doyen of American liberalism, Henry Simons at Chicago University \u2013 led, in a few short decades, to something known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot\" title=\"\">neoliberalism</a>.</p> <p>Simons killed himself in 1946 but not before he and Hayek had raised the money, from a furniture manufacturer, to write a version of his book for a US audience. Two economists failed to finish it. It wasn\u2019t until 1962 that it was completed, by Simons\u2019s pupil Milton Friedman, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism_and_Freedom\" title=\"\">who published it as Capitalism and Freedom</a>. This also marked the break between liberalism and neoliberalism, as I explain in my new book <a href=\"http://radix.org.uk/work/death-liberal-democracy/\" title=\"\">The Death of Liberal Democracy?</a>. Friedman argued that intellectual property was a kind of property, and must be defended as such, rather than \u2013 as it actually is \u2013 a temporary suspension of free trade to encourage innovation. That is why draft agreements such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which purport to be about free trade, are actually about defending investments and trademarks.</p> <p>Even more seriously, Friedman argued that monopoly didn\u2019t matter, and \u2013 if it did happen \u2013 it was the fault of the government for over-regulating.</p> <p>The first error led to the great heresy of neoliberalism, that corporations should be treated like human beings in legal terms. The second was a rejection of the most fundamental element in liberal economics, a defence against the over-concentration of market power. It was the very opposite of liberal free trade.</p> <p>It explains why the dead hand of neoliberal orthodoxy has ignored monopolies as a problem as they grow in power over our lives, as we fall into the tyrannical clutches of companies we are virtually forced to buy from, such as Visa, Google or Amazon, or some toxic future merger, say TescoVirginWalmart.</p> <p>So when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/15/brexit-liberalism-post-liberal-age\" title=\"\">Martin Kettle says that the era of post-liberalism is at hand</a>, he is not talking about political liberalism \u2013 which is suddenly a relevant critique of monopoly power \u2013 he is talking about a liberal heresy called neoliberalism, which means almost precisely the opposite. And when John McDonnell hails the same post-liberalism (which actually sounds more like pre-liberalism) <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/09/full-speech-john-mcdonnell-labour-conference/\" title=\"\">in his Labour conference speech</a> \u2013 a vision of rival nations propping up their own steel industries (precisely the kind of waste that free trade was supposed to tackle), forced to pay more and more as the rivals pay more and more \u2013 he is missing the point.</p> <p>In fact, liberalism is alive and well and awaiting a champion for diverse economies.

Since Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death in February, the nine-seat court has had only eight members, while Senate Republicans have refused to consider Barack Obama\u2019s pick, Judge Merrick Garland.</p> <p>Having only eight members of the court means that, theoretically, any and every case could result in a tie between the court\u2019s four remaining conservative members and the liberals, even in those cases expected to resolve disparities in lower courts\u2019 rulings. </p> <p>Renee Cramer, a professor of law, politics and society at Drake University, cautioned that the effects of the eight-member court on the law \u2013 at least at the beginning of this term \u2013 are likely to be minimal. \u201cThe political implications are probably greater than the judicial implications,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe four-four split wasn\u2019t changing decisions incredibly\u201d in the wake of Scalia\u2019s death, she explained. \u201cBut it was maybe changing the way that those decisions were communicated.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jun/24/us-supreme-court-split-decision-barack-obama-immigration\">Split happens: deadlocks rarely occur in the supreme court.

During the penalty phase of his trial, Buck\u2019s defense attorney \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2016/08/13/texas-lawyer-never-won-capital-murder-case-calls-quits-defending-worst-clients\">called</a> one of the worst defense lawyers in capital cases in the country \u2013 brought to the stand an expert witness intended to demonstrate to the jury that Buck was not a continuing threat to the community, a key standard for imposing the death penalty. Instead, the defense introduced the testimony of Dr Walter Quijano, who wrote that, statistically speaking, Buck was more likely to commit crimes in the future because he is black. </p> <p>He was sentenced to death, and appealed on the grounds that his counsel had been ineffective, though not because his lawyer introduced Quijano\u2019s testimony.</p> <p>The state of Texas later admitted before the supreme court that Quijano\u2019s testimony was prejudicial. But the state objected to the challenge of Buck\u2019s death sentence because his own lawyer introduced the evidence, and because prosecutors do not believe that the circumstances of Buck\u2019s sentencing rise to the level of extraordinary circumstances.</p> <p>The court may decide the case on either question.</p> <h2>Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez v Colorado</h2> <p>Miguel Angel Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez was convicted on three misdemeanor counts of sexually harassing two teenage girls. But after the trial ended, it emerged that one of the jurors \u2013 a former police officer \u2013 had made several racist comments about Mexicans during deliberations. Among other things, he told his fellow jurors that Mexican men were more inclined to commit sexual offenses against women than white Americans.</p> <p>Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez challenged his conviction, arguing that he has a right to an impartial jury under the sixth amendment. But he\u2019s been stymied by laws that prohibit jurors from talking about what happens during deliberations. </p> <p>The court is expected to hear arguments on 11 October that Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez\u2019s right to a jury free of racial prejudice ought to trump laws that prohibit jurors from testifying about their own lack of impartiality.</p> <h2>Manuel v City of Joliet</h2> <p>Elijah Manuel attempted to sue the city of Joliet, Illinois, in federal court after he was arrested for possession of ecstasy based on evidence falsified by the police and was held for nearly two months. He claimed the city had violated his constitutional right against illegal search and seizure under the fourth amendment.</p> <p>The federal judge who heard his case dismissed it: in the federal courts in the district that covers the state of Illinois, lawsuits against the authorities for false arrest or false imprisonment have to be heard in state courts, where plaintiffs have more difficulty winning. (In most other federal districts, these suits can be heard in federal court first.)</p> <p>Manuel appealed, and the appeals court judges ruled again that he should have filed in state court and added that he should have filed within two years of his arrest, instead of within two years of his release \u2013 a standard which would make it even more difficult to sue.</p> <p>If the supreme court sides with Manuel, it would become easier for everyone in Illinois \u2013 including in the city of Chicago, which faces a variety of allegations of police misconduct \u2013 to sue for relief in federal court.</p> <h2>Samsung v Apple</h2> <p>In what may be the final chapter of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/28/apple-samsung-patent-infringement-payout\">expensive</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/31/apple-sues-samsung-for-2bn\">long-running</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/06/apple-samsung-drop-patent-lawsuits-outside-usa\">international</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/22/apple-samsung-patent-dispute\">patent war</a> between the two smartphone behemoths, Samsung is asking the supreme court to decide the appropriate amount of damages for an alleged violation of Apple\u2019s design patents. Oral arguments are scheduled for 11 October.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jul/04/supreme-court-justice-anthony-kennedy-conservative-liberal-legacy\">How the supreme court's tilt to the left rests on conservative Anthony Kennedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To recap: in 2012, a jury decided Samsung had infringed upon three of Apple\u2019s iPhone design patents, which are awarded on the basis of the uniqueness of a product\u2019s aesthetics, not its function. In the penalty phase, based on an 1886 law, Apple was awarded $1.2bn \u2013 the entirety of Samsung\u2019s profits on the allegedly infringing phones \u2013 though the award was reduced to $584m on appeal.<br></p> <p>Samsung argues the majority of a smartphone\u2019s value is in its utility, not in its design (in this case, its bevelled corners and black back side), and thus awarding all its profits on the sales of the phones to Apple based on a design infringement on only three components is a misreading of the law. The court is being asked to decided whether the violation of a design patent on a complex product should trigger an award for the entire value of the product.</p> <h2>Bank of America v City of Miami and Wells Fargo v City of Miami</h2> <p>The city of Miami attempted to sue Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup (which did not pursue the supreme court appeal) for violations of the Fair Housing Act. </p> <p>The city claims the lenders drove a wave of foreclosures that cost the city, by engaging in predatory lending to minority borrowers and offering worse refinancing rates to minorities. </p> <p>The banks successfully argued in federal district trial court that the city could not sue because it was not immediately harmed by the banks\u2019 actions, but the city won on appeal. The supreme court will hear arguments on 8 November (Election Day) to decide whether a city can serve as a valid plaintiff in a discriminatory lending case. </p> <h2>Lynch v Morales-Santana</h2> <p>On 9 November \u2013 immediately after the presidential election \u2013 the court will hear arguments about whether the laws that govern citizenship discriminate based on the gender of the parent.</p> <p>At issue is the citizenship of Luis Morales-Santana, who was born in the Dominican Republic to a father born in the US and a mother who was a non-US citizen. Under the laws at the time of his birth (prior to 1986), children born to unmarried parents outside the US would get citizenship if their mothers had lived in the US for a year. But they would not get citizenship via fathers born in the US unless the father had lived there for 10years, including and five years after the age of 14. (After 1986, the standard became five years for fathers, two after the age of 14.) Morales-Santana\u2019s father was 20 days shy of the limit when he moved to the Dominican Republica, and the government is attempting to deport Morales-Santana.</p> <p>The court has been asked to decide whether the citizenship laws are a violation of the fifth amendment\u2019s equal protection clauses because they differ based on gender. It\u2019s also being asked to decide whether the appeals court had the right to grant Morales-Santana citizenship at all. </p>",

Despite their enthusiam for a new political heroine, they were just as concerned about how she will realise her (and their) ambitions.</p> <p>The Telegraph, while moved by May\u2019s \u201cstirring and patriotic speech\u201d wondered how she will rise to \u201cthe political challenge that lies ahead.\u201d It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cMrs May said she wanted the \u2018right deal\u2019 for Britain. But there are fundamental differences of opinion over what that constitutes, not just in parliament but in her own party...</p> <p>The deep divisions exposed by the referendum are reflected among Conservatives just as they are in the country at large. </p> <p>Mrs May\u2019s task is to chart a course between the two extremes and find a way through that both holds her party together and benefits the country, while retaining a good relationship with Europe. It is a monumental task that has only just begun.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The Times thought May \u201cshort on specifics\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/no-soft-option-n97ztr02w\">demonstrating \u201cthe risk at the heart of negotiations for Brexit\u201d.</a> It urged the prime minister to \u201cacknowledge that many of the regulations that currently apply as a result of membership are helpful for commerce\u201d and EU membership \u201cconfers economic benefits.\u201d</p> <p>It was unimpressed with her \u201cso-called Great Repeal Act\u201d, arguing that \u201cit is simply not correct for Mrs May to have claimed that this legislation will make Britain a \u2018sovereign and independent country\u2019 again.\u201d</p> <p>The paper also said: \u201cThe idea that there are no costs at all in Brexit and that the benefits of membership may be retained is... false and irresponsible.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian was, if anything, slightly softer on the prime minister. It noted that May has still failed to detail what Brexit means, but argued that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-tories-and-brexit-may-still-does-not-know-her-goal\">\u201cshe did enough to be going on with.\u201d</a></p> <p>While accepting that \u201cthis is still a largely symbolic stage of the process\u201d, the paper thought it \u201ca very dispiriting spectacle to anyone who wants the terms of Britain\u2019s departure from the EU to contain some recognition that 48% of the electorate rejected the proposition altogether.\u201d </p> <p>The Independent believed May\u2019s speech indicated <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/theresa-may-s-timetable-for-article-50-won-t-allay-brexit-concerns-a7341636.html\">\u201cshe may be preparing for a hard Brexit\u201d</a> and, if so, \u201cjitters will run through the Europhile wing of the Conservative party quicker than you can say Liam Fox.\u201d</p> <p>It said: \u201cIt is incumbent on the prime minister therefore to provide a clearer sense of what Brexit will look like... Only then can the British people work out whether the government is exceeding the mandate it was given.\u201d</p> <p>The Financial Times was encouraged by May having <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9968043e-88c3-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731\">\u201cprovided much-needed clarity.\u201d </a>Even so, her \u201cspeech still leaves plenty of options open\u201d which \u201cmay not please business, which has been desperate for [Brexit] details\u201d.</p> <p>But the FT is clearly worried: \u201cSignificant questions... remain about the economic impact... Her speech was predictably heavy on patriotic emotion and light on strategy.\u201d</p> <p>The Mail wasn\u2019t so concerned about that, praising May for giving \u201cBritain a date with destiny\u201d and \u201claying out an inspiring vision of Britain\u2019s future after we become an independent sovereign country once more.\u201d</p> <p>It said: \u201cThere is to be no backsliding, no quibbling and no shabby \u2018Brexit-lite\u2019 sellout.\u201d But it also realise that May \u201cshould be under no illusion about the vast scale of the task ahead\u201d, not least from \u201cmany embittered Remainers who still want to subvert the will of the people.\u201d The Mail continued:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThese contemptible wreckers are in total denial about the referendum result. They claim to be standing up for democracy but in fact they are flouting it.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The Sun referred to remainers as \u201cremoaners\u201d and, while conceding that We should \u201cthe road ahead will be tough\u201d believed \u201cthe PM has shown us she\u2019s ready to fight and she believes she can win.\u201d It concluded:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cShe won\u2019t compromise on restoring British sovereignty, cutting immigration or our ability to forge new trade deals \u2014 exactly as the Sun demanded.</p> <p>A confident, capable female Prime Minister we can be proud of on the world stage.

There are also pieces linked to the films The Martian and Suicide Squad. For sports fans there is content from the Williams F1 team, cyclists from Team Sky, boxer Anthony Joshua and several pieces from David Beckham.</p> <p>Perhaps the most interesting pieces, however, will be Sky\u2019s use of 360-degree videos in news, including a documentary on the refugee crisis called Calais: The Jungle, and coverage of the US elections and a piece called Tutankhamun\u2019s Tomb \u2013 The Search for Nefertiti. Sky will also put out a re-imagining of English National Ballet\u2019s production of Giselle for VR and a piece featuring Paul McCartney guiding viewers through the creation of his song Dance Tonight and its music video.</p> <p>Gary Davey, managing director for content at Sky, said: \u201cInterest in VR content is building, generating more excitement every day. We are just at the beginning of our VR journey at Sky, launching Sky VR studios earlier this year and we are already breaking new ground. Now comes the creative challenge of deploying this immersive experience with engaging story-telling.\u201d<br></p> <p>The app will be available on most mid-range and higher-end smartphones through Google\u2019s Cardboard and Samsung\u2019s Gear VR, as well as through dedicated VR headsets from Facebook\u2019s Oculus. It will also be viewable in 2D without a headset.</p> <p>Sky is not the only company producing 360-degree content. Facebook, Google and others are also pushing the new form of immersive content, but the UK broadcaster has one crucial edge for mainstream viewers: its content partnerships with big-name and popular brands, shows and sports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6759be603ee54bf98c126d69257ed1e99ea84acb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6759be603ee54bf98c126d69257ed1e99ea84acb/0_0_2133_969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Team Sky - VR shot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"454\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Team Sky - VR shot</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Interest in VR following the launch of headsets from HTC and Oculus, Samsung and Google\u2019s Cardboard has increased, but the available content for mainstream viewers beyond games has been minimal, with only a few pieces primarily centred around promotion of products or movies being widely available.</p> <p>As with 3D, Sky has been an early adopter of new content technologies, and as with 3D, a broadcaster the size of Sky jumping on board feels like a turning point. </p> <p>Whether 360-degree and VR video is the new big thing, or just another fad like 3D remains to be seen, however.

Over the last two years, companies including American Prison Data Systems, Edovo and JPay have begun to distribute basic tablet computers to thousands of inmates, offering educational and entertainment content which, they say, can help improve behavior and reduce the chances of recidivism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"14968519167a7017187281c439b4cbd3d7c49f7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14968519167a7017187281c439b4cbd3d7c49f7a/0_0_2762_1932/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The JPay tablet, used in some US prisons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The JPay tablet, used in some US prisons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JPay</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>JPay has distributed 80,000 of its JP5S tablets to US prisons, and claims an immediate \u201cimprovement in prison culture and a drop in recidivism\u201d. A modified 7in Android tablet, the JP5S looks like a less colorful version of a tablet designed for preschoolers, but with a clear case that prevents inmates from hiding contraband materials inside. It is preloaded with 20 apps including email, an ebook reader, music player, games, tutorials on how to develop job skills and handle money and a selection of educational videos. </p> <p>At North Dakota state penitentiary, a maximum security facility for men, nearly 700 inmates use tablets made by Florida-based JPay for communication, entertainment or education, says deputy warden Troy Schulz. Inmates plug their tablets into one of the prison\u2019s 14 kiosks to update their messages, music and games. They are limited to 15 minutes, though the prison offers extended access as a reward for good behavior, says Schulz. </p> <h2>Bridging \u2018the digital moat\u2019</h2> <p>At the Five Keys charter school inside the San Francisco county jail, more than 200 adult inmates acquire skills and earn high school credits using tablets provided by <a href=\"http://apdscorporate.com/\">American Prison Data Systems</a>. </p> <p>Since the program launched in October 2014, more than 1,000 inmates have used the specially modified Samsung tablets, which offer access to educational material from a dozen sources including Kahn Academy, Brain Pop and TED Talks. The tablets connect to a secure private network, are monitored remotely 24/7 and can be immediately shut down at the request of prison officials, says Chris Grewe, CEO of American Prison Data Systems (APDS).</p> <p>\u201cUntil recently, correctional institutions were surrounded by a digital moat, isolating the people inside,\u201d says Grewe. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build a bridge across that moat. But first we had to convince prison officials we\u2019d developed a safe and secure platform that could let the good parts of the internet in while excluding the bad things.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6094bc5cf096222ff13427eb6350d5e94d5298b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6094bc5cf096222ff13427eb6350d5e94d5298b5/0_0_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A tablet from American Prison Data Systems.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tablet from American Prison Data Systems.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: American Prison Data Systems</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Edovo\u2019s tablets, secured and encased versions of the 7or 8in Samsung Galaxy Tabs, are used in a dozen states across the country, says CEO Brian Hill.

We spend our own money to deploy that infrastructure and conduct ongoing maintenance, therefore there are fees associated with using our products and services.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Steve Good, director of the Five Keys charter school, estimates that the APDS tablet program costs from $85,000 to $100,000 a year, funded largely by grants from the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.calwellness.org/\">California Wellness Foundation</a>. APDS is a for-profit Public Benefit Corporation, requiring it to weigh the social impact of its actions against its potential profits. </p> <p>Edovo leases its tablets to municipalities for $1.25 to $1.75 a day, with fees often paid through the facility\u2019s inmate welfare fund. \u201cAll of society benefits hugely from investing in educating the incarcerated,\u201d says Hill. \u201cDigital education is safe, cheap, effective, and one of the few things we can do that will both make us safer and save taxpayer dollars.\u201d</p> <h2>21st century communications</h2> <p>The problem is that many prison officials are wary of technology and risk averse, says Edovo\u2019s Hill. \u201cEvery prison should be connected,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if prisons gave unfettered internet access to inmates today, I fear they wouldn\u2019t know how to secure it properly. Then all you need is one inmate to send an improper email or Facebook message to a victim. When that story makes the front pages, the prisons will use that data point to make sure no one ever gets connected again.\u201d</p> <p>And that leaves millions of Americans not only incarcerated in a cell but also frozen in a pre-internet world, says EFF\u2019s Dave Maass. </p> <p>\u201cThis is how people communicate in 2016,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re making fewer calls, and do most of our communications through instant messaging, Facebook and other types of social media.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a> has announced her plans for Brexit, insisting that controlling immigration and withdrawing from the jurisdiction of the European court of justice would be her priorities during European Union (EU) exit. She says Article 50 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/may-on-collision-course-with-backbenchers-seeking-soft-brexit\">will be triggered before March</a>. </p> <p>So, with our departure from the EU now in sight, how do those who made the decision to leave or remain feel now?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/100-days-since-the-brexit-vote-how-do-you-feel-now\">We asked our readers about this to mark 100 days since Britain voted to leave the EU, and we received over 1,000 responses</a>.<br></p> <p>We had responses from people who had backed each of the opposing camps, and some people who didn\u2019t vote at all. 95% of them said that they did not regret their decision.</p> <p>How do you feel about the vote now, especially after May\u2019s latest announcement? Below, five people explain what it has meant to them. Share your thoughts in the comments.<br></p> <h2>Leavers</h2> <h2>Ed, 23, from Amersham: \u2018The only regrets I have is the way the referendum was won\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a24cee8c75f561d866fe54b2de7b3343edff9442\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a24cee8c75f561d866fe54b2de7b3343edff9442/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"edmund bannister\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I voted Leave for several reasons. Firstly, the EU\u2019s involvement in other countries can be meddling. Also, there wasn\u2019t much sympathy for Greece and the union left them to limp along while imposing further austerity measures. The migrant crisis has been handled badly as well, and Merkel\u2019s stance of open doors isn\u2019t realistic for every country.<br></p> <p>Federalisation works in America but Europe has history and attempting to unify a continent as diverse as it creates tensions.<br></p> <p>Nothing has really changed so far so it\u2019s hard to tell whether I see the benefits having been reaped. I doubt there will be serious long-term effects for our economy. We had the wrong government in place to deal with Brexit (I contemplated voting stay for this reason) but it felt like it was once in a lifetime opportunity. I know there wouldn\u2019t be another chance to vote leave.<br></p> <p>The only regrets and concerns I have is the way the referendum was won \u2013 for example claims that \u00a3350m would be given to the NHS. I think leaving, however, was the best idea. If we are now allowed to limit immigration to skilled workers then that would be very beneficial. I do have some objections to importing a workforce of unskilled workers. This creates more tensions. I don\u2019t think the EU is the force for peace it brands itself. I am glad that Article 50 will invoked in 2017. </p> <h2>Alka Sehgal Cuthbert, 54, from London: \u2018I am very pleased with my decision\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c07a0ef5ad119bf2b82550fb62b546db67c2429c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c07a0ef5ad119bf2b82550fb62b546db67c2429c/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Alka Sehgal Cuthbert\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I voted Leave and I am very pleased with my decision. I\u2019m glad that after years of politics being technocratic, soul-destroying and tedious, people in Britain experienced an inkling of what politics has been \u2013 and could \u2013 be again. The lack of a plan for every economic and political eventuality is not a problem, it is something that is a chance for everyone to consider how he or she would like to re-vivify public political culture. Let\u2019s face it our political and economic situation was pretty poor to start with, so why not ask bigger questions, or start from a different point? The only real impact of Brexit on my life has been that my family holiday was more expensive, and some of our savings for children\u2019s education may have been adversely affected.</p> <h2>Remainers </h2> <h2> Allan Collins, 85, from Scotland: \u2018Since the vote I have seen chaos and muddled thinking\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dd0126b1321e303d619f859b3bbd112526a26a92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd0126b1321e303d619f859b3bbd112526a26a92/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Allan Collins\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> I voted Remain. I feel even more certain now, that like most of my fellow Scots, I voted correctly. At my age I lived through the dark days of a divided Europe. I saw the human wrecks caused by the first world war, and the devastation of the second. All because of a divided Europe.<br></p> <p>Over the last few years I have enjoyed the pleasure of travelling freely to European countries, and I have seen the improvement to infrastructure in the Highland and Islands. I have felt very much part of the family of Europe. I have felt the security of being part of that great united family. <br></p> <p>Since the vote I have seen chaos and muddled thinking. There seems to be no strategy or plan to move forward. Government ministers seem to be completely divided and we are becoming a laughing stock. We talk about getting the right terms, but what do we have to bargain with? <br> </p> <p>At this early stage, the result hasn\u2019t affected my life or finances but I am certain it will. And not in a good way. <br></p> <h2>Helen Quenet, 56 from Hatfield: \u2018I hate what the UK has become in these 100 days\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"632c885bcb967b6a14e5061e602ee2d71994af1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/632c885bcb967b6a14e5061e602ee2d71994af1e/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Helen Quenet\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I voted Remain and am still shocked and angry at what happened. I\u2019m hoping some way will be found to stop it. I believe it is a huge self-inflicted wound that will damage the county irreparably.</p> <p> I\u2019m especially disgusted with the racism and abuse that the result has provoked. I have a Belgian name because I married someone who was \u201conly\u201d fourth generation British. My youngest son risks missing out on Erasmus and my 85-year-old mum risks losing all the lovely carers she has from Europe. I hate what the UK has become in these 100 days. <br></p> <p>If I could get a European passport I would leave the country. Unfortunately that isn\u2019t an option available for me. </p> <h2>Smiley, 31 from London: \u2018It is the slow dissolution of Britain as a tolerant safe society\u2019<br></h2> <p>I voted to Remain and am now thinking of moving to Canada. The result of the vote is the slow dissolution of Britain as a tolerant safe society with rights blinking out like stars on a cloudy night and violent thugs feeling enabled to harass and murder in the street. The economic future potential of this nation will be occulted for years and I don\u2019t think anything can be done to stop unemployment rising and the standard of living from falling.<br></p> <p>Because the company where I work has a lot of EU funded projects and relies to a greater than average degree on a predictable model of population and economic growth, all predicted models have been thrown into chaos and there\u2019s a general air of uncertainty and dread which is the background of all conversations on future plans.</p> <p>I\u2019m not married and don\u2019t have children so I don\u2019t have as many emotional ties as some. Besides look at the way things are going. If Article 50 is enacted then I can look forward to a future of xenophobia, reduced ability to work and travel, and my rights left unprotected by EU Human Rights Legislation. If I had children, this isn\u2019t a country I would want to bring them up in.</p>",
  "<p>Philip Hammond has confirmed he will jettison George Osborne\u2019s economic targets, although the chancellor remains set on achieving a balanced budget.</p> <p>He will use his party conference speech on Monday \u2013 just weeks before his first autumn statement \u2013 to say the UK needs a new plan for post-Brexit times.</p> <p>Hammond also signalled an intention to borrow more to invest in infrastructure projects as companies are being more cautious about spending after the vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>He said there was a \u201cdistinction in my mind between investing in things that will make Britain\u2019s economy more efficient in the future, transport systems, communications systems \u2026 and simply spending more on the day-to-day business of government\u201d. He said there was a case for \u201ctargeted high-value investment in economic infrastructure\u201d to support the economy and make Britain more productive.</p> <p>Told he sounded more like former shadow chancellor Ed Balls than his predecessor, Osborne, Hammond said he hoped he sounded like a \u201cConservative pragmatist\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOur circumstances have changed. The exit vote, the slowing of the world economy creates a new set of circumstances. And as we go into a period where inevitably there will be more uncertainty, we need to have the space to be able to support the economy through that,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.</p> <p>The chancellor said he remained determined to achieve a balanced budget, while reiterating that this would happen in a \u201cpragmatic\u201d way without the need for a surplus this parliament. He said there needed to be a general framework to reassure the financial markets that there is a credible plan for reducing the UK\u2019s deficit, which remains \u201cunsustainable\u201d.</p> <p>The more rigorous austerity measures set out by Osborne \u201cwere the right ones for that time\u201d, Hammond will say in his speech. \u201cBut when times change, we must change with them. So we will no longer target a surplus at the end of this parliament.\u201d</p> <p>But Hammond will stress that the general aim of a balanced budget remains, saying: \u201cMake no mistake: the task of fiscal consolidation must continue. It must happen within the context of a clear, credible fiscal framework that will anchor expectations, control day-to-day public spending, deliver value for money and get us back to living within our means.\u201d</p> <p>The chancellor said the economy was in robust form but the government needed to make sure it was prepared for Brexit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71e93fdc2a363c5a25c33e6da4ec602ef8c7bd15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71e93fdc2a363c5a25c33e6da4ec602ef8c7bd15/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Housing construction work\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The construction scheme aims to speed up homebuilding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, Labour said the prime minister\u2019s drive for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d \u2013 pulling the UK out of the single market to achieve her immigration controls \u2013 would undermine the decision to borrow to invest.</p> <p>John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said this kind of model for leaving the EU could cause a \u00a339bn hit to the public finances by 2019/20.</p> <p>\u201cAll the signs are that after all our campaigning Philip Hammond is about to perform a sizeable U-turn on investment spending, but this will be undermined by Liam Fox and Boris Johnson\u2019s hard Brexit strategy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe Tories are fighting among themselves and while Phillip Hammond tries to make his mind up Liam Fox is ideologically pushing for a \u2018Hard Tory Brexit\u2019, and writing cheques he wants working people in Britain to balance.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot be forced into a \u2018Hard Tory Brexit\u2019 because the chancellor won\u2019t stand up to his fellow cabinet colleagues.

Grimaldo, a Spain youth international and free-kick wizard, only joined from Barcelona in January but is hot property \u2013 although there is a cool \u00a351m buy-out clause to navigate around. <strong>Valencia, Juventus</strong> and, yes, <strong>Middlesbrough</strong> are also keeping tabs.</p> <p>Another hot young Spaniard is going absolutely nowhere.

A fitting tribute to Arnold Palmer, who will hopefully be looking down on Hazeltine from the great clubhouse in the sky.</p> <p><strong>Europe meanwhile will scuttle off and lick their wounds. </strong>Darren Clarke\u2019s side were soundly beaten, but they can be proud of Rory McIlroy, who came of age as a senior figure in the team, and have blooded a real gem in Thomas Pieters. They\u2019ll go again at Le Golf National in Paris in 2018. Jordan Spieth\u2019s already been on TV saying the US team have victory in their sights; it\u2019s going to be another wonderful brouhaha!

Have you ever thought that it\u2019s surely only a matter of time before a professional soccer star, celebrating a goal in the athletic style, mistimes his slide along the turf and splinters his kneecaps into a million bony shards? Similarly, pro golfers in the Ryder Cup really do go overboard with the high fives sometimes, don\u2019t they? There they are, slapping each other\u2019s hands, the tools of their trade, with feeling and a force that is surely excessive. Well, Patrick Reed and Jordan Spieth were certainly highly excited when Reed eagled 6 yesterday afternoon. Gimme five, partner! Don\u2019t leave me hangin\u2019! Problem is, it would seem Reed seriously jarred Spieth\u2019s finger during the throes of their ecstasy. That would explain Spieth\u2019s uncharacteristically dismal form for the remainder of that match; it also raises the question of his ability to compete properly in the singles today.</p> <p><strong>Word right now is, Spieth will be OK to face Henrik Stenson on the first tee at 11.15am. </strong>Phew. If he pulls out before, Darren Clarke will have to present his Special Envelope containing the name of the European player who\u2019d also drop out in such a circumstance. That player would be paired in the draw with Spieth, and their match would be marked down as a half. Henrik Stenson, instead of facing Spieth as originally planned, would move to play whoever the unlucky European was drawn to face. Perhaps Stenson\u2019s in the Special Envelope? Who knows. Anyway, that hopefully won\u2019t be necessary. Here\u2019s to Spieth being hale, hearty, and able to start and finish his match; if he tees off but has to withdraw hurt, Europe will win that one by default.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f0edfee4b05962fdf4a170\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T11:22:44.776Z\">12.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There haven\u2019t been many better individual performances in the entire history of the Ryder Cup than the one served up by Patrick Reed yesterday afternoon. </strong>Consider the context. The United States of America had gotten off to a dream start in the 41st Ryder Cup, 4-0 in the opening series, but by 5pm on Saturday had been hauled back to parity by a rugged European comeback. Reed and his playing partner Jordan Spieth had thrown away a four-hole lead and half-a-point in the morning; in the afternoon, they\u2019d let slip another dominant position, a three-hole lead against Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson frittered down to one. All of a sudden Europe had a realistic chance of getting something from two of the remaining three matches still out on the course. It was all in the balance.</p> <p><strong>But Reed is made of the right stuff. </strong>With Spieth strangely out of sorts, Reed had built the initial American lead in the match all by himself: three birdies and an eagle between holes 5 and 8. Now he put the foot to the floor again, with bang-bang birdies at 14 and 15, an immediate response to danger that catapulted US to dormie. They\u2019d tie up the match soon after. \u201cHe\u2019s Captain America for us,\u201d Jordan Spieth enthused. \u201cWhat a front nine he had with five birdies and an eagle on his own! Then on the back nine he came through on 14 and 15. He really birdied 16 as well and probably would have birdied 17 if he had to.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Good luck, then, to Reed\u2019s opponent in today\u2019s singles!</strong> Roaring Rory McIlroy has without question been Europe\u2019s answer to Reed, a force of nature raging against the dying of the European light. He\u2019s won three of Europe\u2019s six-and-a-half points, the high-water mark being that eagle at 16 on Friday, though he has done quite a lot of shouting too. His poor vocal cords must look like Harry Nilsson\u2019s after the Pussy Cats sessions. (Just throwing in a cutting-edge pop reference to keep the kids interested.) Rory has been a rare success story for Europe this week, the first name on a short list that also includes the rookies Thomas Pieters, Rafa Cabrera Bello and Chris Wood, and signally omits experienced wild-card picks Martin Kaymer and Lee Stadler-Westwood. His mano-a-mano duel with Reed promises fireworks. Can\u2019t wait!</p> <p><strong>Rory will need to put some blue on the board early if Europe are to have any chance of retaining their trophy. </strong>Problem for Darren Clarke\u2019s team is, even if he does that, their chances are slim: the USA only need five points from the 12 singles rubbers to win, and they\u2019ve been by far the better team this week. Their 9\u00bd-6\u00bd lead is thoroughly deserved. Lightning can strike twice, but the problem there is, we\u2019re not in Medinah any more. Still, you never know, and that\u2019s why we all love sport. Whatever happens, there are some sensational matches taking place this afternoon. It\u2019s going to be a hell of a ride, as the USA look to put an end to eight years of hurt, and reclaim the trophy they first won in 1927, and on 24 glorious occasions since.

  "<p>You learn early on that you\u2019re not going to make everything all right. Lots of kids just have very tough lives, whether one of their parents has a drink or drug problem, their dad\u2019s just died, or they are seeing a lot of fighting going on. Sometimes social services do something about it. Mostly, they don\u2019t because they simply can\u2019t.</p> <p>A lack of therapeutic intervention by social services is quite common in austerity Britain, and it was one of the big surprises when I started my career, working on the frontline of child mental health in schools. Indeed my local social services describe themselves as an \u201cemergency service\u201d, and increasingly seem to manage levels of risk, rather than help situations or people improve. In many parts of the country, Camhs \u2013 child and adolescent mental health services \u2013 is similarly stretched.</p> <p>When I did my training, I thought we would be taught how the human mind works \u2013 and how to fix it. I imagined we would be given a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/25/colouring-in-classic-car-books-motoring-haynes\" title=\"\">Haynes care maintenance manual</a>, if you like. I was 35: probably too young, definitely too naive. I\u2019m 50 now, and understand less than ever about the complexities of emotions and thoughts that are inevitably ensnared in the kids I work with, and that\u2019s probably not so bad. After all, the last thing kids want is to be told what is good for them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/ng-interactive/2014/aug/26/social-care-careers-an-interactive-guide\">Social care careers: an interactive guide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Take one eight-year-old boy I worked with. The police had to step over needles and a stash of guns to find him cowering under a bed. He was taken into care and moved to a new school miles away, where I met him. But the social worker hadn\u2019t really explained to him why he\u2019d had to leave his dad. As a result he was deeply confused, and very untrusting.</p> <p>He would dive under the table as soon as our counselling sessions came to an end and growl like a dog, refusing to move. Reflecting on this with my supervisor, we wondered if it was where he felt safe, and in control. All behaviour is communication, as the saying goes. The last thing he wanted was to be dragged off somewhere new again by strangers. So we acted out the story of a hurt, distrustful puppy being placed with a new owner using puppets, and discussed how unsafe that dog must feel. It took a lot of time for the boy to feel more understood but he\u2019s doing better now.</p> <p>Social services\u2019 \u201cthresholds\u201d \u2013 the level of need at which they deem it necessary to intervene \u2013 are absurdly high at the moment. But that frustration never goes away. A colleague worked with a child who was seeing a lot of domestic violence at home, and helped her to plan a strategy for keeping herself safe and calling the police when things were kicking off. An hour later she got an irate phone call from a social worker telling her to stop interfering and to not place too much responsibility on the kid. That\u2019s as far as the new \u201cjoined-up thinking\u201d gets.</p> <p>My daughter is in year 3, and we\u2019ve been on several camping trips around the UK this summer. Only one of the 20 kids I work with each week has had more than a single day trip during that time. I had a comfortable and happy childhood, and it has been a real eye-opener seeing how hard so many families have it. I guess it\u2019s all about perspective, isn\u2019t it? If more people in the UK could visit the country\u2019s deprived estates and really get to grips with how life is there, maybe there would be a greater sense of compassion for struggling parents and families.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc17f8ccb7acd3869e0a9108ff7d3a641de8e402\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc17f8ccb7acd3869e0a9108ff7d3a641de8e402/0_47_1443_866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children drawing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Quite often you need a light touch, even a bit of humour, to get things moving.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Someone I know recently posted a picture of two dogs she\u2019d adopted from Romania on Facebook. \u201cHow English is that,\u201d I thought. Forget the refugee children \u2013 let\u2019s look after the animals. Because, let\u2019s face it, children with deep emotional needs can be trickier to love than pets. Yet in forgotten corners of the UK, like the estates where I work, it is only the love and toil of the teachers and teaching assistants that is keeping the lights on for many kids right now.</p> <p>There are lovely things about working in primary schools: the community ethos, the values, the constant thinking about others, and the working-together ideal that teachers embody and hope the children will embrace. It\u2019s hard to square the Brexit vote with that, and unfortunately it seems to have unleashed some attitudes at home that have filtered through to the children. I\u2019ve heard of several racist remarks in schools since term started and have been asked to work with a Polish family who have faced hostility at the school gates.</p> <p>There is a focus on one-to-one therapy, but in practice, this isn\u2019t always the most effective route. I\u2019ve had far better results working with the parents or carers and children together. I\u2019m not the most confident of people, and some of the hardest moments are being with kids and their carers when they\u2019re at the end of their tether, or talking about the really difficult stuff. Quite often you need a light touch, even a bit of humour, to get things moving. If a kid draws a picture of tanks blowing up his parents, well, it\u2019s a starting point.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/13/secret-life-call-centre-worker\">The secret life of a call centre worker: a degree of compassion never hurts | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pay is similar to teaching, but contracts are generally short term as funding is always shaky. Yet despite the difficulties, it\u2019s an undeniable privilege to work with children: their imagination, their energy \u2026 it\u2019s just wonderful.</p> <p>Us adults with our job titles and qualifications might think we know best, but kids often heal themselves through their friendships. It\u2019s a big ask of any kid to open up to a stranger who she only sees once a week for 45 minutes. Children with similar life experiences tend to gravitate towards each other. Sometimes just saying, \u201chey, you know Aidan in year 5 has been through the same stuff as you \u2013 he got adopted last year,\u201d is enough of a pebble to drop for two kids to get talking and things to make more sense for them.</p> <p>Children who constantly get into trouble tend to develop low self-esteem, no matter how hard they seem on the outside. They get to be known as \u201cthe bad kids\u201d, and they soon see themselves that way too. This doesn\u2019t leave much fuel in their tanks when it comes to wanting to change.

We are continuing to recruit and look for more staff but it is not easy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe deal is not only in the hands of Turkey but Europe \u2026 some EU states are not respecting but neglecting their responsibilities.\u201d</p> <p>In the three months since Britain voted to leave the EU, the bloc had become ever more fractious, with central European and Balkan members increasingly pursuing their own agenda. \u201cIn the post-Brexit debate of how Europe will work, \u2018flexible solidarity\u2019 has become the new key phrase,\u201d he said. \u201cIf, in so many EU summits it has been agreed that the refugee crisis is a European problem then the solution to resolve it should be collective \u2026 allowing Greece to become [a holding pen for refugees] is absolutely unacceptable.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Trotting hungrily through the streets of San Sebasti\u00e1n, local food writer Sasha Correa stops at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bar-Goiz-Argi/177054849089118\">Bar Goiz-Argi</a>, \u201ca great place\u201d. Really? It\u2019s shoulder-wide and looks like a betting shop, with its neon, and floor littered with serviettes. However, it is packed and no one\u2019s doing selfies with <em>pintxos</em>, they\u2019re just here to eat them. Yes, yes, the seaside city has nine Michelin-star restaurants, but exquisite, odd, innovative and gloriously beautiful food is also available pretty much everywhere. It does help having an expert to tell you where to start, so I asked 10 gourmands for their pick of the local restaurants and bars.</p> <h2>Bodeg\u00f3n Alejandro</h2> <p>This is a bit like a dungeon, but in a good and glowing way. Its proximity to Mercado de la Bretxa made it the bolthole of choice for traders, a place to tuck in to cheap fish and <em>txakoli </em>(sparkling dry white wine), pork and cider after work. Now very much upgraded, chef Inaxio Valverde still makes good use of the market\u2019s fresh, local and seasonal produce. A menu weighted towards fish in summer \u2013 cold, marinated anchovy lasagne with gazpacho cream (\u20ac15.50), grilled hake in citrus vinaigrette (\u20ac21) \u2013 leans towards game through winter. The apple pie with rosemary trifle and lemon thyme ice-cream (\u20ac8.50) is a permanent fixture, along with the selection of local cheeses: Bidearte, Txapalak, Piku\u00f1eta and Urdina (\u20ac11.50). Two main dining areas are dominated by an enormous luminous inky painting of the San Sebasti\u00e1n coast, the gleaming wooden tables are engraved with maps and quotes, and the lighting is conducive to a boozy lunch. The parents of multi-Michelin-star chef <a href=\"https://www.martinberasategui.com/es/inicio\">Mart\u00edn Berasategui</a> once ran this restaurant, and it was here, at the tender age of 13, that he started learning his trade.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>C/ Ferm\u00edn Calbet\u00f3n, 4, +34 943 427 158, </em><a href=\"http://www.bodegonalejandro.com/\"><em>bodegonalejandro.com</em></a><em>.

In fact, they are created from fish, foie, mushrooms balanced on puff pastry and griddled bread, topped with decorative slithers of anchovies or <em>guindillas</em> (pickled chillis); and of course, they\u2019re salty, designed to be drunk with a sharp, fresh txakoli, the local wine. You could stand here \u2013 or at least try \u2026 it\u2019s crowded \u2013 and stuff yourself, or retire to the intimate restaurant for some of the best hake in town. Try the moist, flaking <em>kokotxas</em> (the chins of hake or cod, \u20ac29.50), baby squid, elvers and big fish \u2013 sole, wild turbot, bream \u2013 sold by weight and charcoal-grilled for two to share.
