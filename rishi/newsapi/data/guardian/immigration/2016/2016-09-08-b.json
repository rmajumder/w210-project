We\u2019ve seen an escalation in bikie laws particularly all over the country by both sides of politics here. There hasn\u2019t been a single side of politics that says we want lighter sentences.\u201d</p> <p>The fact Labor was yet to strip back many harsh sentencing measures for gang and drug crime introduced under Newman, including anti-bikie laws that high-level independent reviews had recommended repealing, further belied Dutton\u2019s claim, Ananian-Welsh said.</p> <p>\u201cSo there are much clearer actions [Labor] could be taking around just implementing the recommendations of inquiries rather than this very abstract allegation that they would appoint a judge in the hope that that judge whilst on the bench would deliver lighter sentences,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Ananian-Welsh said Dutton\u2019s attack \u201cjust absolutely highlights the necessity for reform\u201d around judicial appointments in Queensland, where there is no independent judicial commission as there is in New South Wales.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a process that is clear and ensures that judicial appointments are justified by reference to publicly available standards, so that everyone knows exactly why a judge was appointed. </p> <p>\u201cAnd then we don\u2019t get into these kind of arguments.\u201d</p>",

But he was also explicit about saying he wanted Labour to stop the UK leaving the EU. This came in a discussion with David Dimbleby.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>DD: </em>You said you would like to see Labour going into the next election saying our party policy is to go back into the EU.</p> <p><em>OS:</em> Yes.</p> <p><em>DD: </em>You ignore the Brexit vote.</p> <p><em>OS:</em> Exactly.</p> <p><em>DD: </em>Exactly?</p> <p><em>OS:</em> Exactly. We need to find out what it is. The Brexit vote set a direction, if we like. We don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going.</p> <p><em>DD:</em> You know where you are going. You are going back in. </p> <p><em>OS:</em> Well, I hope we are. And I think we should be strong about that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Smith said Labour would be entitled to go against the referendum vote because people were lied to. But Jeremy Corbyn disagreed. He said parliament should accept the vote to leave the EU, but he said it was important to ensure that the Brexit deal protected workers rights.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Smith claimed people around Corbyn were encouraging people with antisemitic views to join Labour.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think Jeremy has not been strong enough in speaking out against antisemitism ... Under Jeremy\u2019s leadership we have seen people coming into Labour from the hard left of politics who are bringing in antisemitic attitudes ... Some of the people around Jeremy are encouraging it. There is absolutely no doubt.</p> </blockquote> <p>Corbyn strongly objected, saying that Smith\u2019s claim was unfair. \u201cI have spent my life opposing racism in any form, as have you,\u201d he told Smith.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn said Labour should review the Shami Chakrabarti report in the future to see what progress was being made on tackling antisemitism.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn said he wanted the UK to remain in the single market after Brexit \u201cif it\u2019s possible and I think it probably is\u201d.</strong> Earlier this week one of his aides suggested Corbyn was not committed to full single market membership.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn said he expected the Labour party to unite behind him if he won the leadership election.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think after the election is over and after the conference is over you will see the wish of MPs to reflect the wishes of party members all over the country that there is a coming together in order to oppose this Tory government.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn claimed that he could increase support for Labour through a political \u201cre-energisation\u201d that would mobilise people who had never voted in the past, like the young</strong>. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The core vote ... is also a very large number of people who are intrinsically inclined towards Labour but have not bother to vote in the past. Only 47% of young people voted in the last general election. I tell you this now. There is a re-energisation in politics over the past year. Many of those that have joined the party, many of those that are very active in local groups, are very well connected with colleges, with universities, with young people at work. I tell you this; after this leadership [election] is over, there is going to be that energisation in politics which will challenge the Tories ...</p> <p>A Labour opposition offering investment in a growing economy, a Labour opposition offering to invest, to drive down the inequalities in Britain and invest in a growing economy with sustainable jobs, I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s very attractive and will bring an awful lot of people over to Labour.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s all from me for tonight.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T22:44:42.702Z\">at 11.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d1e01ee4b08465d44fec43\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T22:03:47.395Z\">11.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Rowena Mason</strong>\u2019s story about the debate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/jeremy-corbyn-claims-he-can-unite-labour-to-take-on-tories\">Jeremy Corbyn claims he can unite Labour to take on Tories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I will post a summary with a further set of quotes shortly.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d1da04e4b08465d44fec3a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T21:56:24.603Z\">10.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here are some Tweets from Labour/left figures who are not Corbyn supporters.</p> <p>From <strong>Adrian McMenamin</strong>, a former Labour special adviser and staffer</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/adrianmcmenamin/status/773992323499917312\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If you come at the king, you best not miss.

Having adopted large chunks of the Corbyn policy agenda, he has two main offers: competence/electability, and Europe. He was probably at his best in the early stages of the debate, talking about Labour\u2019s performance in the polls but it did not feel as if his arguments, robust as they were, were going to make much impression on those like the \u201cfeel the love\u201d Corbynista councillor. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/jeremy-corbyn-v-owen-smith-on-bbc-question-timess-labour-leadership-hustings-live?page=with:block-57d1c56fe4b08465d44fec05#block-57d1c56fe4b08465d44fec05\"> 9.10am.) </a></p> <p>On Europe, Smith has a distinctive position which should be attractive to Labour\u2019s pro-European membership. And tonight he seemed to go further than he has in the past, making explicit something previously only implicit and saying that if he were leader Labour could reject the EU referendum result and opt to keep the UK in the EU. Many pro-European politicians, like Paddy Ashdown and Tony Blair, would back this 100%. But it is a tricky argument to make now, because it is tantamount to saying \u201cignore the referendum\u201d, and the studio audience reacted quite badly when he made his case.</p> <p>Smith should have had the edge over Corbyn too on security, but the reminder of his Isis gaffe set him back.</p> <p>Generally, though, Corbyn seemed to exude confidence. With the polls suggesting he is well ahead, this is not surprising, but what was striking was how much better a performer Corbyn is now at this format than he was a year ago. He was relaxed and even funny at times, and he managed to brush off Smith\u2019s most aggressive criticisms, over extremism. It helped that the audience seemed more on his side than Smith\u2019s (so much for \u201cBBC bias\u201d - see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/jeremy-corbyn-v-owen-smith-on-bbc-question-timess-labour-leadership-hustings-live?page=with:block-57d1c108e4b013613fffb619#block-57d1c108e4b013613fffb619\">8.57pm)</a> His claim that he would be able to take Labour to power by inspiring the young may sound fanciful (the psephologists say boosting youth turnout mostly helps Labour get larger majorities in the seats they hold anyway), but it seemed to strike a chord with a large Labour chunk of the studio audience. What the public at large think is another matter, but this was a Labour-dominated audience and they seem happy to keep him as leader.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T22:48:57.180Z\">at 11.48pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d1d117e4b07ac3d446a51b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T21:00:49.361Z\">10.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: Would you work with your opponent?</em></p> <p>Corbyn says he would be delighted to work with Smith.</p> <p>Smith says he has already said he would not serve under Corbyn.</p> <p>And that\u2019s it.

Whereas last year\u2019s Labour leadership contest was relatively good-natured, this year\u2019s has been much spikier. The contest was triggered because 75% of Labour MPs voted for a motion saying they had no confidence in Corbyn but Corbyn refused to resign. Corbyn\u2019s allies saw this as a coup mounted by 172 MPs prepared to defy the will of more than 400,000 members and supporters who voted in the leadership contest last year. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/04/corbyn-and-smith-face-off-in-tense-labour-leadership-hustings\">The first hustings between Jeremy Corbyn and the challenger, Owen Smith, in Cardiff at the start of August, was frosty. </a>Since then it\u2019s got worse.</p> <p>Tonight\u2019s hustings may be the most high-profile yet, although its impact on the result could be limited because many members will have already cast their vote. Corbyn and Smith are on a Question Time special. According to Wikipedia (I did try the BBC press office, but they would not say) a normal Question Time gets seen by almost 3m people. But this one is going out at 9pm, an hour and a half earlier than when the programme usually airs.</p> <p>As the leadership contest nears its end - the winner will be announced on 24 September, a fortnight Saturday - Corbyn remains the overwhelming favourite. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/04/corbyn-and-smith-face-off-in-tense-labour-leadership-hustings\">A YouGov poll of people voting in the leadership contest last week</a> found Corbyn ahead by 24 points.

  "<p>The royal commission into the protection and detention of children in the Northern Territory could expand to encompass the rest of Australia without delaying its current plan, the Greens say.</p> <p>Following further revelations about alleged mistreatment of juvenile detainees, Greens senator Rachel Siewert has written to prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, calling for an expansion of the terms of reference and suggesting a \u201ctwo-tiered\u201d inquiry.

Positions were taken and minds made up before the ballot papers were ever printed. Nothing either Jeremy Corbyn or Owen Smith did or said was ever going to change a thing.

The hustings were only ever window dressing; a psychodrama for voyeurs intruding on the private grief of the Labour party.</p> <p>When the therapy started back in early August, Corbyn and Smith were relatively polite to each other. Corbyn was Corbyn and Smith was Mini-Me. But as the reality that he was on a road to nowhere began to penetrate his consciousness, Smith began to get angry and frustrated. He saw a future that could only end in unhappiness and wondered why he had ever allowed himself to be cast as the saviour of a party that was beyond saving; a party the opinion polls indicated the rest of the country thought was unelectable. Smith lashed out. He insulted Corbyn, accusing him of crimes against the party and humanity; in a more measured fashion, Corbyn fought fire with fire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/jeremy-corbyn-v-owen-smith-on-bbc-question-timess-labour-leadership-hustings-live\">Jeremy Corbyn v Owen Smith on BBC Question Time's Labour leadership hustings - live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The therapy was going nowhere. There was only one possible way forward: the nuclear option. The Jeremy Kyle Show. Aka a BBC live debate hosted by David Dimbleby in front of a TV audience that had more interest in making mischief than getting answers. After Dimbleby had made his opening remarks, Corbyn and Smith were introduced to the audience; both looked as if they had just realised the debate wasn\u2019t such a good idea after all and would have dearly loved an opportunity to back out.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re both unelectable,\u201d said the first questioner. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you both stand aside and let someone else unite the party?\u201d Disagreeing with this was about the only thing that Corbyn and Smith could agree on for the next hour. </p> <p>Corbyn was insistent that only Smith was unelectable and that once the contest was over, people would come flocking back to the Labour party under his leadership. A large section of the audience cheered at this. Smith was equally adamant that Corbyn was the problem and cited the opinion polls. A small section of the audience applauded; a larger number booed. Everything was going entirely to plan. The Labour party was tearing itself apart on primetime TV.</p> <p>The only person who seemed bothered by this was one woman in the audience who was on the verge of tears at the contempt that different factions of the Labour party had for one another. Corbyn tried to cheer her up by saying he was certain that millions of people who had never voted before were desperate to vote for Labour at the next election. Just believe. The woman didn\u2019t look as if she had Corbyn\u2019s faith.</p> <p>On it went. Corbyn\u2019s ideology versus Smith\u2019s pragmatism, with neither giving an inch. The problem for Smith was that ideology was winning hands down in the audience. The debate quickly turned more personal. \u201cYou did this,\u201d said Smith. \u201cNo I didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Corbyn. \u201cYou did.\u201d The EU. Immigration. Defence. The topics came and went, but the divisions remained the same, though both achieved the same end. Both made voting Labour look an unattractive option. By the end, real Labour supporters were begging for the programme to end.</p> <p>As it did so, a trail announced that it would be repeated at 1.25 on Saturday morning.

  "<p>A recent news report <a href=\"http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/08/05/american-muslim-women-removed-from-plane-for-making-flight-attendant-feel-unsafe/\">documented the removal of two Muslim women</a> working for the federal government from an American Airline flight. On its surface the airline staff appeared to be upholding safety regulations, but in reality they were engaging in discriminatory practices. I know this to be true because I was one of the two women. We were removed from the plane for doing nothing more than requesting water and asking why we were still aboard an idling plane for more than five hours.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Although the incident was humiliating it was also eye-opening. Until it happened to me, neither my friend nor I had realized how common this trend had become. Passengers are removed from an aircraft for benign reasons such as asking for a beverage, a child harness, speaking a foreign language, changing orupgrading seats, taking pictures, making videos, or questioning a long delay. It isn\u2019t just about what happened to me \u2013 increasingly Muslims are a part of a cycle of discrimination that targets them due to their appearance. </p> <p>American Airlines states that they prohibit \u201cdiscrimination of any kind\u201d and ensure that their \u201cpolicies require that we treat all our customers in a fair and courteous manner and discrimination due to race, ethnicity, religion, or skin-color is not tolerated\u201d. However, this was not reflected in the treatment that I and other passengers received. </p> <p>Shan Anand, a young, turbaned, Sikh man along with three of his Muslim friends were <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/lawsuit-claims-flight-ejected-men-muslim-article-1.2499843\">removed from an American Airlines flight</a> traveling from Toronto to New York earlier this year. When I asked Shan why he thought he and his friends were removed from the flight he said: \u201cWe know why it happened, right? There were four of us, three are Muslim and I am Sikh.\u201d When Shan and his friends asked American Airlines why they were removed, they were told: \u201cThere were inconsistencies of their behavior traveling as a group.\u201d But the explanation made no sense to Shan \u2013 he was traveling in a group of six with two Latinos, three South Asians and one Arab, yet only the South Asians and Arab were removed. Shan and his travel companions were told that \u201cthe crew felt unsafe\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cUnsafe\u201d: a trigger word commonly used as an excuse by airlines under the pretext of ensuring safety and security post-9/11. Nearly all Muslims have at some point been subject to secondary security screening selection, but being thrown off a plane was an entirely new level of humiliation for me. </p> <h2>Measuring discrimination</h2> <p>Khurram Ali, the former civil rights director for the Council on American-Islamic Relation\u2019s (CAIR\u2019s) New Jersey chapter, explains that the pilot of an aircraft is given a list of those passengers that are marked with the infamous SSSS on their boarding pass. The SSSS or *S* indicates someone needs to be scrutinized a bit further by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). And although it is unknown if airline attendants have access to the names labelled SSSS by TSA on domestic flights, they do have access to their respective airline computer reservation system, which details passenger name and detailed information.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/16/southwest-airlines-man-removed-flight-arabic\">Southwest Airlines draws outrage over man removed for speaking Arabic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although there is no published criteria used to select passengers for \u201crandom selection\u201d or \u201csuspicion\u201d, Ali says: \u201cIt is happening to more and more people who are considered visibly Muslim.\u201d Ali documented 27 airline discrimination complaint cases with three of those being \u201cpulled off\u201d or airline removal cases for CAIR\u2019s New Jersey chapter during his short tenure. But as he pointed out, those numbers come nowhere near the amount being documented by CAIR on a national level.</p> <p>CAIR has been fairly thorough in its documentation of discrimination against American Muslims, however it is still in the process of aggregating data regarding Muslim airline passengers being \u201cpulled off\u201d planes. Corey Saylor, CAIR\u2019s director of the department to monitor and combat Islamophobia, acknowledged that they \u201care seeing more airline cases\u201d. But in regards to statistics, Saylor stated: \u201cWe do not have stats as of yet. We are working on it.\u201d </p> <p>The only cases the public is aware of are those documented in the media. I counted nine airline passenger removal cases involving American Muslims published in the media over the past 13 months. But if that isn\u2019t indicative enough, just look at trending hashtags on social media like #FlyingWhileMuslim to understand and confirm the reality of rising discrimination. </p> <p>The official reasons for removal of these passengers are all in relation to safety and security concerns. But there is no mistaking this trend toward discrimination of Muslims.. Here are a few examples:</p> <ul> <li>Mohamed Ahmed Radwan made the flight attendant feel \u201cuncomfortable\u201d when he asked her why she called him out over the public tannoy with the words \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/muslim-kicked-off-plane-american-airlines-racial-discrimination-cair-uncomfortable-a7147311.html\">I will be watching you</a>\u201d.

(Delta Airlines, July 2016)</li> </ul> <p>Many instances have gone undocumented due to fear of victims being further targeted, labeled troublemakers and being put on a \u201cno-fly\u201d list. The silent acceptance of these incidents has enabled airlines to dismiss the arbitrary treatment of select passengers as compliance with airline security regulations post-9/11. This policy is not effective and ultimately makes Americans feel marginalized in our own country. </p> <p> Khairuldeen Makhzoomi, or Mark for those that have trouble pronouncing his name, recalls his experience with Southwest Airlines as \u201ctearful and humiliating\u201d. Makhzoomi came to America after his father was executed in Iraq by Saddam Hussain: \u201cI experienced dictatorship in Iraq and now I am experiencing it in the freest country in the world.\u201d </p> <p>The discrimination Khairuldeen faced in Oakland, California, was anything but subtle. Khairuldeen detailed how he was removed from the aircraft, questioned by airline representatives and security, cornered against a wall, searched, sniffed by dogs in public and later interrogated privately by the FBI. Southwest Airlines representative and the authorities that removed him from the plane berated him for having spoken Arabic aboard the aircraft. Khairuldeen recalled the Southwest Airlines representative, stating: \u201cWhy would you speak that language knowing the environment in an airport?\u201d </p> <p>Khairuldeen said: \u201cI was excited because we were talking about my upcoming graduation from UC Berkley, saying \u2018inshallah\u2019. You know, we use this word 30 to 40 times in any given conversation.\u201d The rest of Khairuldeen\u2019s conversation revolved around what they served for dinner at an event he attended which hosted the UN secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon. \u201cI was telling my uncle that they served us chicken, mash potatoes and spinach for dinner at the event,\u201d said Makhzoomi. Yet the authorities that escorted him and claimed to understand Arabic, accused him of \u201cdiscussing martyrdom\u201d in his telephone conversation. </p> <h2>An atmosphere of fear</h2> <p>Cenk Uygur, political commentator and co-founder of the Young Turks, believes that this issue goes beyond discrimination towards Muslims in particular. Uygur was also kicked off of an American Airlines flight but he doesn\u2019t believe it was because of religion. \u201cWas it religious? In my case, I don\u2019t think it was racially motivated.\u201d Uygur believes that the root of the matter boils down to power and compared airline attendant behavior toward Muslims since 9/11 to police officers abusing their authority and using excessive force on African Americans. \u201cAfter 9/11 airlines/flight attendants have taken up the \u2018I can do whatever I want attitude\u2019 in the name of security,\u201d Uygur says. \u201cIn my opinion, the core of the problem is flight attendants are given unlimited power and they tend to abuse it. They tend to use their power on those they perceive to be powerless. And unfortunately in America, the darker the skin color the more powerless you are. And many Muslims tend to fit in that category.\u201d </p> <p>He adds: \u201cBy the way, it\u2019s much harder on women, because they are more visibly Muslim and they often bear the brunt of the burden of Islamophobia or discrimination.</p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump has given people permission to be Islamophobic and told them that it\u2019s okay to discriminate against Muslims. Trump basically says, \u2018If I become president I will systematically discriminate against them [Muslims],\u2019\u201d Uygur says.</p> <p>Likewise, Khairuldeen Makhzoomi attributed the recent rise in discrimination towards Muslims to Donald Trump, saying, \u201cTrump is using \u2018Islamophobia\u2019 to rise to political power.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s statements have fostered and further instigated an atmosphere of fear and prejudice towards the estimated 6-7 million Muslims in America. </p> <p>I\u2019m an American, and being labeled a safety threat is unacceptable in a country founded on tolerance and freedom. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

She describes herself as \u201cobscure, underground\u201d, but she creates prolifically to stave off boredom. Her songs are spectral lullabies inspired by gender theory, philosophy and psychoanalysis. In previous interviews, the 36-year-old has discussed the architecture of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/antoni-gaudi\">Antoni Gaud\u00ed</a>, moon cups, the philosopher F\u00e9lix Guattari and Paris Hilton\u2019s sex tape.

I\u2019m sorry. I moved on.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps her omnipresent fear of death is the way to break the ice.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of why I make music,\u201d Hval says in a beat, \u201cto create this reconciliation with theatre and with dying. And I think that\u2019s what a lot of [artists] are doing. It\u2019s the ultimate feeling \u2013 to feel like it\u2019s OK to die now. It\u2019s OK. Like a Venn experience, of life and death getting closer, and it\u2019s OK.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVaWc00aZ30\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZVaWc00aZ30?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Female Vampire by Jenny Hval.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Beyond the existential process of making music, there is a greater correlation between mortality and music for Hval. Her new album, Blood Bitch, is loosely based on themes that occupy a million Twilight messageboards: vampires and menstruation. Dead blood, essentially. The record was recorded in the months after her acclaimed breakthrough album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/07/jenny-hval-apocalypse-girl-album-review\">Apocalypse, Girl</a> was released last year. It was her third LP under this name and her fifth solo record in total; she previously recorded as Rockettothesky and used to front a goth band called Shellyz Raven.</p> <p>\u201cI was watching a lot of low-budget horror movies from the 1970s \u2013 the kind of movies nude vampires would appear in,\u201d Hval says of the conception of Blood Bitch. \u201cMany of them are considered terrible movies, but I watched them differently from a film critic and I did get a lot out of watching. Part of that was to take pieces of random dialogue and narratives and find ideas about blood. It just kept arriving in lyrics I was writing or improvising. It\u2019s my favourite experience of all experiences that I have \u2013 that thing that arrives and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, but you feel that it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>While Apocalypse, Girl had a more linear narrative \u2013 at least, she made it sound that way in interviews, when she often discussed gender and sexuality \u2013 Hval decided to make its follow-up a challenge to herself, the listener and anyone interested in decoding its meaning. It is not a direct rebellion against the social shame surrounding menstruation, although it is unusual to hear periods affiliated with pleasure, power and sensuality \u2013 \u201cI have big dreams / And blood powers\u201d, she sings in Untamed Region \u2013 rather than pain and uncleanliness. But she does not want to become part of a culture of think pieces and social media debate, she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7e71544a79421c21c19976fe912dbba0a28f51ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e71544a79421c21c19976fe912dbba0a28f51ce/0_0_2724_3570/763.jpg\" alt=\"Jenny Hval\" width=\"763\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I certainly don\u2019t make art to start conversations on Facebook.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jenny Berger Myhre</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI certainly don\u2019t make art \u2013 and I think that this goes for a lot of artists \u2013 to start conversations on Facebook. That is not enough. I want to change poetic conversations. I want to change philosophical conversations and I also just want to give people images that connect. Something like menstruation to something like vampires. I want to make these odd, abstract associations that open up the wild creatures of the world that are not just \u2018women: we menstruate\u2019 or \u2018men: we don\u2019t menstruate\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Fragmented and ambient, almost cinematic in its structure, Blood Bitch comes with spoken-word segments and odd noises. At one point, the sound of squeezing liquid drips, eerily. What liquid is it? \u201cIt\u2019s water. It\u2019s a type of water. It\u2019s a mysterious type of water,\u201d she says gleefully. \u201cSome mysteries will remain for the listener to decide what he or she thinks.\u201d</p> <p>Despite her roots in the avant garde, Hval is still wedded to the concept of making songs that bring people in, rather than push them away. Is she worried that the obscurity and abstract nature of her ideas will prevent her from making accessible pop?</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d replies Hval. \u201cI think, whether it\u2019s pop music or not, it\u2019s not up to me to decide whether it\u2019s working or not on this or that level.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t find what I do ethereal. If other people do, then that\u2019s fine, because at least with Blood Bitch I\u2019m working with something I just want to be a strong expression. I want it to be beautiful and I want it to be full of feelings and reconciliation with death and all that kind of stuff. And I think it is immediate and that for me is a pop album. Immediacy can be so many different things, so I never worry. I\u2019ve never had to work with a record label that has expectations of something being very firmly pop music. But also, when I make music, I think \u2013 this is a radio hit! Then I bring it to someone else and they say: I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>How does that feel?</p> <p>\u201cGreat!\u201d</p> <p>Really?</p> <p>\u201cReally,\u201d she says absolutely, already moving on.</p> <p><em>Blood Bitch is released on 30 September on Sacred Bones</em></p>",

An uninformed person looking at the picture may have concluded that he was in charge and that the woman beside him (Theresa May) was some sort of aide. His name is<strong> Nick Timothy</strong>, he is May\u2019s co-chief of staff and, on the basis of today\u2019s grammar school news, you could be forgiven for thinking he is running the country.</p> <p>Timothy used to be May\u2019s chief of staff when she was home secretary and during that period he did not have a media profile. But then he left to work as head of the New Schools Network and, during that time, he spoke to the media and wrote a regular (and very good) column for ConservativeHome, which means we know a great deal about what he thinks.</p> <p>Two of the most surprising announcements to come from May since she became prime minister can be directly traced to his thinking. The last-minute decision to delay agreeing the new Hinkley Point nuclear power station? Timothy set out the thinking behind that in a ConservativeHome column last October, <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/10/nick-timothy-the-government-is-selling-our-national-security-to-china.html\">The Government is selling our national security to China.</a> And extending grammar schools? Timothy proposed exactly that in <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11981856/Nick-Timothy-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools.html\">an interview with the Daily Telegraph last November.</a></p> <p>So what else in on Timothy\u2019s agenda? Here are five policies that he is likely to be pushing, based on what he has said in the past.</p> <p><strong>1 - Introducing tighter curbs on student visas. </strong>(Timothy wrote about that <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/12/nick-timothy-the-government-as-a-whole-isnt-aiming-to-cut-immigration-at-all-and-the-autumn-statement-proved-it.html\">here.)</a></p> <p><strong>2 - Making it easier for faith schools to expand.</strong> In<a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/01/nick-timothy-how-schools-can-bring-our-divided-communities-together.html\"> a ConservativeHome article</a> Timothy wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government should abolish its admissions rule for faith-designated free schools \u2013 which requires a school, when it is oversubscribed, to limit the number of pupils it accepts on the basis of faith to fifty per cent \u2013 and replace it with a more effective approach. The existing rule fails according to its own objective: it does little to increase the diversity of Jewish, Muslim, Sikh and Hindu schools, because for now at least they are unlikely to appeal to parents of other faiths. But the rule is effectively discriminatory for Roman Catholics: it prevents them from opening new free schools because it is almost certainly <a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P2N.HTM\">against canon law</a> for a Catholic Bishop to set up a school that turned away Catholic pupils on the basis of their Catholicism. Given that there is growing demand for Roman Catholic schools, which are more likely to be ethnically diverse than other schools, more likely to be in poor areas, more likely to be rated Good or Outstanding by Ofsted, and more likely to provide what parents want, the rule should be replaced by a legal duty on faith schools to ensure that their pupils mix \u2013 perhaps through sport, performing arts, or school visits \u2013 with children of other backgrounds.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3 - Making welfare more contributions-based.</strong> In another article Timothy said one problem with the Conservative election defeat of 1906 was that it led to plans for contributions-based welfare backed by his hero Joe Chamberlain being shelved.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In 1906, MPs behaved as though their identities as free traders and tariff reformers were more important than as Unionists, and the consequences of their defeat continue to be felt even now. The Lloyd George \u2018People\u2019s Budget\u2019 of 1908 introduced a non-contributory pension system \u2013 unlike the contributions-based proposal made by Chamberlain that was rejected by Salisbury and Balfour \u2013 and our welfare state to this day remains non-contributory (a fact that is, coincidentally, relevant to the debate about EU nationals claiming benefits in Britain).</p> </blockquote> <p>As my colleague Heather Stewart has already reported, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/29/theresa-may-urged-revive-social-insurance\">May\u2019s new director of policy, John Godfrey, is also interested in social insurance systems that create stronger links between what individuals pay and the welfare they get. </a></p> <p><strong>4 - More housebuilding.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/03/nick-timothy-what-does-the-conservative-party-offer-a-working-class-kid-from-brixton-birmingham-bolton-or-bradford.html\">In another ConservativeHome article</a> Timothy wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Often \u2013 on aspects of welfare reform, the increase in the minimum wage, and the investment in the Northern Powerhouse and the (excruciatingly badly-branded) Midlands Engine \u2013 the Government has got these calls right. But when it comes to energy policy, house building, <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/12/nick-timothy-the-government-as-a-whole-isnt-aiming-to-cut-immigration-at-all-and-the-autumn-statement-proved-it.html\">high immigration</a>, <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/11/nick-timothy-dividing-lines-and-binary-choices-how-the-tax-credit-changes-went-wrong.html\">cuts to tax credits</a>, the protection of pensioner benefits, and the profile of spending cuts, it has not.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>5 - A full inquiry into Orgreave. </strong>The Home Office is still considering calls for a full inquiry into Orgreave, but Timothy said <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/05/nick-timothy-as-with-hillsborough-we-must-get-to-the-bottom-of-what-happened-at-orgreave.html\">in a ConservativeHome article </a>he was in favour of a proper inquiry.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The economy needed to be reformed, the unions needed to be faced down, and unprofitable pits needed to be closed. But if the police pre-planned a mass, unlawful assault on the miners at Orgreave, and then sought to cover up what they did and arrest people on trumped-up charges, we need to know.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here are two ideas that Timothy strongly supports - but which May is much less likely to back because they would involve abandoning Conservative party manifesto promises.</p> <p><strong>6 - Getting rid of the \u201ctriple lock\u201d that ensure state pensions rise every year in line with growth or inflation or by 2.5%, whichever is higher.</strong></p> <p><strong>7 - Abandoning plans to lift the inheritance tax threshold to \u00a31m.</strong> In<a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/11/nick-timothy-dividing-lines-and-binary-choices-how-the-tax-credit-changes-went-wrong.html\"> one ConservativeHome article</a> Timothy wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The chancellor] could redistribute the welfare cuts to take the pressure off low-paid, working people. But the obvious alternative is already off the table: pensioner benefits are protected and so is the \u201ctriple lock\u201d, which means that the state pension goes up by the highest out of the growth of wages, inflation or 2.5 per cent. Another option \u2013 to demonstrate that the Government really does value hard work above all else \u2013 is to stop the inheritance tax cut for estates valued between \u00a3650,000 and \u00a31 million.

Letwin said that he personally was \u201cperfectly content\u201d to see the government explore the idea of expanding them, but he also said he was \u201ccompletely agnostic\u201d about whether one type of school was necessarily better than another.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d1430be4b08465d44fe9b3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T12:08:11.900Z\">1.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">5 thing we've learnt from Justine Greening's UQ on grammar schools</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ministers are often hauled to the Commons to answer an urgent question (UQ) when the government has floated a policy idea in the media but has not yet made a formal announcement. That is exactly what happened today, when <strong>Angela Rayner</strong>, the shadow education secretary, was granted a UQ on the back of the Telegraph splash. Normally the minister just turns up and tells MPs to wait until the formal policy paper is published, and in many respects that\u2019s what <strong>Justine Greening,</strong> the education secretary, was doing today, but these sessions can be nevertheless be quite illuminating and today\u2019s certainly was. Here are five things we learnt.</p> <p><strong>1 - Theresa May\u2019s plan to \u201cbring back grammar schools\u201d is popular with Conservative MPs - but only up to a point.</strong> Most of the Tory MPs who spoke expressed support for grammar schools. But the very first backbencher to be called, and arguably the most important on this issue, <strong>Neil Carmichael</strong>, the Conservative who chairs the Commons education committee, expressed strong reservations. Telling Greening that the UK was well down the table in international literacy and numeracy league tables, he went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is absolutely necessary for any discussion about grammar schools to not distract us from that fundamental task that we have of improving social mobility and making sure that we have the best use of all of the talent across the whole country and not just talk about the few.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Sir Desmond Swayne,</strong> a former PPS to David Cameron and certainly no Tory leftie, told Greening that he would not fancy having to face parents in his constituency who could not get their children into a local grammar school. (See <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/grammar-schools-theresa-may-plans-for-inclusive-grammar-schools-slammed-politics-live?page=with:block-57d139b8e4b0c1d95ae148eb#block-57d139b8e4b0c1d95ae148eb\">11.14am.)</a> And<strong> Lucy Allan, </strong>another Conservative, demanded an assurance that there would be no return to the days of the 11-plus. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/grammar-schools-theresa-may-plans-for-inclusive-grammar-schools-slammed-politics-live?page=with:block-57d137e5e4b042bbfb32482d#block-57d137e5e4b042bbfb32482d\"> 11.07am.)</a></p> <p><strong>2 - Greening herself seems to sceptical about championing a grammar school renaissance.</strong> Some Labour MPs said they thought Greening sounded distinctly lukewarm about the policy she was supposed to be defending and they were right. Greening kept stressing the importance of having an open mind on the matter of educational reform and she said nothing to suggest that she is a grammar school enthusiast (while, quite cleverly, also avoiding sounding disloyal to May.) In fact, Greening even seemed reluctant to use the term \u201cgrammar school\u201d, instead preferring to talk about selection.</p> <p><strong>3 - A full return to a grammar school system seems to be off the table - although the government is considering letting more grammar schools open and extending the principle of selection in state education. </strong>Greening was not specific about much, but she did make it very clear that the government was not planning a full return to the grammar/secondary modern era. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There will be no return to the simplistic, binary choice of the past where schools separate children into winners and losers, successes or failures. This government wants to focus on the future, to build on our success since 2010 and to create a truly 21st century schools system.</p> </blockquote> <p>And when asked if she would return to the days of the 11-plus, she replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can assure you that there will be no return to the past. This is about moving forward. This is about having a 21st century approach to our school system, precisely not one that is rooted in the 1960s and 1970s. </p> </blockquote> <p>But Greening did say: \u201cWe do think selection can play a role.\u201d It could be that May is keen to talk about grammar schools is because the phrase is popular with the public. (See <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/grammar-schools-theresa-may-plans-for-inclusive-grammar-schools-slammed-politics-live?page=with:block-57d127bee4b0b2ee83376361#block-57d127bee4b0b2ee83376361\">10.08am.) </a>But whether the government\u2019s proposals really do involve a large number of new grammar schools, in the traditional meaning of the word, remains to be seen.</p> <p><strong>4 - </strong><strong>Labour is remarkably united in strongly opposing grammar schools. </strong>By my count only one Labour MP expressed some support for the government\u2019s idea (<strong>Kate Hoey</strong>) and otherwise it was striking how MPs from all wings of the party spoke out very strongly against the idea. <strong>Angela Rayner,</strong> the shadow education secretary, was particularly effective. She told Greening:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Can you tell the House what evidence you have to support your belief that grammar schools will help disadvantaged children and close the attainment gap? At a time when our schools are facing a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention, with the thousands taught in super-sized classes and schools facing real-term cuts to their budget for the first time in nearly two decades, pushing ahead with grammar schools shows a dangerous misunderstanding of the real issues facing our schools.</p> </blockquote> <p>This makes it all the more surprising that Jeremy Corbyn chose not to raise the grammar school issue at PMQs yesterday. Perhaps he chose to avoid the subject because <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3778820/Corbyn-s-team-attended-used-grammars-children.html\">his son attended one, and his head of strategy and communications Seumas Milne sent his children to grammar schools.</a> Given that<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/may/13/uk.politicalnews2\"> Corbyn\u2019s second marriage broke up because he did not want his son to go to a grammar school</a>, he could argue that his opposition to grammar schools is so strong and sincere that it has led to great sacrifice. But it is understandable why someone very reluctant to discuss his family in public may have decided it was a subject best avoided at PMQs.</p> <p><strong>5 - T</strong><strong>he Tories will try to turn this into an issue of what works versus ideology. </strong>Greening did not really engage with the arguments raised about grammar schools and social mobility. Instead, she just argued that it was sensible to have a debate, and she accused Labour of being dogmatic. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It would be wrong to discount how we can improve prospects for those children, especially the most disadvantaged, purely because of political dogma. If Labour is not willing to ask itself these difficult questions, how can it possibly come up with any of the solutions? </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c032f06bf39507cbcec5abcadc19072e37293f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c032f06bf39507cbcec5abcadc19072e37293f8/49_0_720_432/500.jpg\" alt=\"Justine Greening.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justine Greening answering the UQ on grammar schools.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/BBC News</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T12:21:32.756Z\">at 1.21pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d14114e4b013613fffb3e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T10:49:10.638Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Heather Stewart</strong> on Justine Greening\u2019s UQ.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/773821240209465344\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Justine Greening sounding less-than-enthusiastic about grammars in House.

However, it is certainly interesting to note that public opinion is quite nuanced; when people were confronted with two counterarguments to grammar schools, support was in some cases strong. What does this mean for the overall stance of public opinion? It could mean two things: first, it could suggest that public opinion is malleable and that if parties opposed to new grammar schools exploit that malleability, the voters may be turned away from grammar schools. Alternatively, though, it could suggest that while voters are clearly aware of the counterarguments to grammar schools \u2013 and have some degree of affinity with them \u2013 this is already baked in to the polling numbers; in other words, that voters know the problems with grammar schools but feel overall that grammar schools should still be opened.</p> </blockquote> <p>Polling Digest also says that people \u201coverwhelmingly agree that grammar schools help academic success and increase social mobility\u201d. This is interesting because it is the exact opposite of what people who are experts in social mobility have been saying, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/07/former-tory-minister-grammar-schools-fail-disadvantaged-children\">David Willetts here,</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/grammar-schools-expansion-disaster-social-mobility-tsar-alan-milburn\">Alan Miliburn here.</a> (Put more bluntly, the public are wrong.)</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d12605e4b0c1d95ae14883\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T08:50:26.205Z\">9.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <strong>Sally Weale </strong>has written a very good article about what it is like for parents in Kent where children are sitting the 11-plus to see if they can get into grammar school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/08/kent-children-11-plus-government-plans-grammar-schools\">Kent children sit 11-plus as government plans new grammar schools</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d122efe4b0b2ee83376350\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T08:36:44.795Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There is an urgent question on grammar schools in the Commons at 10.30am.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/labourwhips/status/773794329462706176\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">UQ at 10.30 from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AngelaRayner\">@AngelaRayner</a> asking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustineGreening\">@JustineGreening</a> on Government plans to lift the statutory ban on opening new Grammar Schools in Eng</p>&mdash; Labour Whips (@labourwhips) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/labourwhips/status/773794329462706176\">September 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The speaker takes a dim view of ministers announcing policy on the front page of the Telegraph and not in the House of Commons chamber.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d1213ce4b0b2ee83376349\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T08:32:21.976Z\">9.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tusk says UK should start Brexit talks with EU &quot;asap&quot;</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Donald Tusk,</strong> the president of the European council, is meeting Theresa May in Number 10 this morning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/773798859067813888\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Meeting PM <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresa_may\">@theresa_may</a> to inform about EU27 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bratislavasummit?src=hash\">#Bratislavasummit</a> and discuss process for Brexit talks <a href=\"https://t.co/ANGuFY7wAC\">pic.twitter.com/ANGuFY7wAC</a></p>&mdash; Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/773798859067813888\">September 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/773798947697659904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our goal to establish closest possible EU-UK relations.

  "<p>News broke yesterday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/07/johnny-depp-set-tupac-notorious-big-film-labyrinth\">Johnny Depp will play former LAPD detective Russell Poole</a> in a film adaptation of the 2002 true-crime book LAbyrinth, which advanced Poole\u2019s controversial theories about the still-unsolved murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG (Christopher Wallace). </p> <p>This isn\u2019t the first time author Randall Sullivan\u2019s book has been tapped for the big screen. In 2003 Sylvester Stallone announced plans to star, write and direct a project based on LAbyrinth, but nothing came of it. So why the Depp project now? And who is Russell Poole? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/02/straight-outta-compton-reel-history-nwa-eazy-e-ice-cube-dr-dre\">Straight Outta Compton: hit biopic raps up NWA story cleanly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first answer is that hip-hop films are all the rage, following the success of last year\u2019s NWA biopic Straight Outta Compton, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/31/straight-outta-compton-tops-us-box-office-we-are-your-friends-bombs\">which grossed over $200m worldwide</a>. A new movie about Tupac \u2013 with a $45m budget \u2013 comes out 11 November, called All Eyez on Me, and an Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard biopic starring Michael K Williams is also in the works.</p> <p>As for Russell Poole, following Wallace\u2019s 1997 murder in Los Angeles, he grew convinced that the Los Angeles police department itself was guilty. He believed cops named Rafael Perez and David Mack were in cahoots with Tupac\u2019s label Death Row Records (Wallace\u2019s arch enemies), and that a friend of Mack\u2019s named Harry Billups had pulled the trigger. When LAPD put the brakes on his investigation in 1999, he resigned. His conspiratorial views informed both LAbyrinth and a 2002 documentary by the British film-maker Nick Broomfield called Biggie &amp; Tupac. Poole also joined forces with Voletta Wallace, Notorious BIG\u2019s mother, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/19/notorious-big-lawsuit-los-angeles\">an unsuccessful lawsuit</a> against the department alleging wrongful death. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c92f7f6068f928a115e2809d5b7b2d8336f07863\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c92f7f6068f928a115e2809d5b7b2d8336f07863/0_0_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnny Depp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnny Depp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Buck/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As for Tupac\u2019s 1996 drive-by murder in Las Vegas: Poole also believed there was a cover-up involving police. \u201c[T]he Vegas guys told us that the main reason they would never solve this case was that the politicians didn\u2019t want them to,\u201d Poole told LAbyrinth author Sullivan. \u201cThey said the powers that be had let them know the city didn\u2019t need an OJ-style circus.\u201d Poole initially fingered Death Row boss Suge Knight, but eventually concluded Tupac\u2019s killing was orchestrated by Sharitha Knight (Suge\u2019s wife) and Reggie Wright Jr, Death Row\u2019s head of security. Poole contended they were after the assets of Suge \u2013 who was driving the BMW that was shot up in the Tupac murder \u2013 and stood to benefit from his death.</p> <p>Poole died of a heart attack last year and left a legacy of a committed detective who wasn\u2019t afraid to speak truth to power. Unfortunately for him and Johnny Depp, however, his theories don\u2019t hold up to scrutiny. During reporting for my new book I studied all of the theories in the Tupac and Notorious BIG murders, and didn\u2019t find Poole\u2019s compelling. Instead, I\u2019m more inclined to believe conclusions reached by another former LAPD detective, named Greg Kading, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/27/tupac-notorious-big-murder-rap-documentary-police-investigation\">who began his investigations in 2006</a>, and published his findings in his 2011 book Murder Rap and a 2015 documentary of the same name. </p> <p>Kading concluded that Tupac was murdered by a Crip named Orlando Anderson \u2013 the same man Tupac beat up in a Las Vegas casino just hours before he was shot. (Anderson\u2019s uncle, known as Keffe D, claimed he and his nephew were offered $1m to kill Tupac and Suge by the head of Wallace\u2019s label, Sean \u201cPuffy\u201d Combs.) Kading also determined that Suge Knight paid a man named Wardell \u201cPoochie\u201d Fouse $13,000 for the hit on Wallace. </p> <p>Murder Rap also systematically dismantled Poole\u2019s theories. Poole believed in David Mack\u2019s guilt partly because a black Impala SS was found in his garage \u2013 the same model used in Wallace\u2019s killing. Unfortunately, Kading noted, the murder car was actually green, not black. Poole\u2019s theory in the Tupac murder hinges on the unlikely scenario that Sharitha Knight and Reggie Wright Jr enlisted men for the task including Death Row affiliate Little \u00bd Dead. Little \u00bd Dead\u2019s supposed motivation to want Tupac dead? That Tupac had stolen the song Brenda\u2019s Got a Baby from him. In my opinion this theory is implausible. </p> <p>Twenty years after Tupac\u2019s death, a consensus is finally emerging about who killed Tupac and Wallace. The majority of people I talked to for Original Gangstas agree with Kading\u2019s theories. Therefore, if you ask me, if Johnny Depp wants to star in a glossy Hollywood adaptation of a Tupac and Wallace book, it shouldn\u2019t be LAbyrinth. It should be Murder Rap. </p> <ul> <li>Ben Westhoff\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Original-Gangstas-Untold-Eazy-E-Shakur/dp/0316383899\">Original Gangstas: The Untold Story of Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, Tupac Shakur, and the Birth of West Coast Rap</a> is published by Hachette Books on 13 September<br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The Home Office has announced plans to close the controversial Dungavel immigration removal centre in Scotland, in a move that has been quickly praised by campaigners.

It would have 51 beds and most stays would probably last fewer than seven days.</p> <p>Dungavel sparked widespread condemnation for holding <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/may/23/child-detention-review\">young children</a>, before deportation, for periods exceeding a year. </p> <p>Aamer Anwar, a human rights lawyer, said: \u201cThe closure of this institution, which has been described over the years as barbaric, inhumane and racist, is long overdue. However, today, there is no room for complacency if this institution is simply replaced with another at Glasgow airport controlled by the Home Office that cares more about deportation than human rights.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/29/court-rejects-government-appeal-fast-track-detention-asylum-seekers-michael-gove\">Court rejects government appeal over fast-track detention of asylum seekers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anwar, who had represented the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/06/child-asylum-seekers-win-compensation\">Ay family</a> \u2013 Kurdish asylum seekers with four children aged seven to 14 detained at Dungavel for more than a year in 2003 before they gained asylum in Germany \u2013 urged the Scottish government to demand Home Office guarantees of \u201crigorous and independent accountability\u201d for the new facility.</p> <p>Those concerns were echoed by Jerome Phelps, director of the organisation Detention Action, who said that while the facility\u2019s closure was an important step towards the UK government\u2019s intention of reducing numbers of migrants in detention, there were serious questions about plans to transfer migrants from Glasgow airport to immigration removal centres in England after seven days. </p> <p>Phelps said: \u201cPeople could be forced to abandon legal challenges in the Scottish courts, and start again with new solicitors in the English courts. The government should give a clear commitment not to detain, in England, migrants with pending asylum or immigration claims in Scotland, other than in exceptional circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Naomi McAuliffe, director of Amnesty International\u2019s Scotland programme, said that while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/apr/23/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices\">closure was welcome news,</a> all of the UK needed a more humane approach to detention. \u201cGoodwill\u2019s remarks focus on the fact that the new holding facility is near Glasgow airport and will save money. The reality is that indefinite detention is expensive, ineffective, and extremely harmful to many of the people held. Dungavel was cited in the Shaw report last year [for its] substandard accommodation and damaging use of indefinite detention.

  "<p>Omar\u2019s journey from Syria to Europe included a trip in a tiny boat from Turkey, a trek across Europe and months in legal limbo alone in the Calais refugee camp, waiting for his chance to cross safely to his extended family in the UK. </p> <p>Arriving at St Pancras station in London on Thursday, with a small backpack and a shy smile, the 17-year-old was almost overwhelmed by the significance of the moment.</p> <p>He was greeted with cheers as he walked into the cafe where the volunteers and lawyers who had helped him through the gruelling legal process waited for him. He is the 50th child refugee to arrive in the UK under the EU\u2019s Dublin regulation, brought over by Safe Passage, an organisation run by Citizens UK to lobby and make legal representation on refugee children\u2019s behalf.</p> <p>His cousin Abdullah, one of the first family members he has seen in almost a year, stood protectively at his shoulder. Omar\u2019s parents and siblings are still in Syria. Unable to pay to bring the whole family to Europe, they sent their eldest son to make the journey alone. </p> <p>\u201cWe were always so worried about him. It\u2019s such a relief to have him here, so much better. We are relaxed, now, to have him here,\u201d Abdullah said with a broad grin. \u201cHis parents are so happy he\u2019s here now, with his family.\u201d</p> <p>Under the Dublin regulation refugee children have the right to be resettled in countries where they can be reunited with their families, but Omar had been in limbo for months in the Calais refugee camp, submitting his application for transfer in March. </p> <p>The Home Office approved his \u201ctake charge\u201d request in June, but no transfer date came through for two months. That date finally came through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/what-am-i-waiting-for-child-refugees-trapped-in-calais-appeal-to-mps\">24 hours after Omar\u2019s case was featured in the Guardian</a>, after he met the MPs Yvette Cooper, Heidi Allen and David Burrowes, who expressed dismay at how the teenager had been left at risk in the camp despite the UK accepting responsibility.</p> <p>Sitting down in the cafe with its pink patterned walls and floral teapots, Omar struggled to describe the feeling of being in the UK. For months he had slept alone in a makeshift hut, on a wooden bed piled with blankets.</p> <p> Chronic overcrowding has led to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/calais-refugee-camp-running-out-of-food-as-donor-fatigue-sees-donations-dry-up\">deteriorating conditions in the camp</a>, with tension and violence increasing. Omar said he never told his family of the dangers he was facing.</p> <p>\u201cI was so, so happy,\u201d he said, when his transfer date finally came through, although he still had to wait for a few weeks in the camp for the day to arrive. Three others who arrived with Omar said they were too overwhelmed to come to the party. Several of them had had tearful reunions with their fathers. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63883186111dfb6253c7551f9568f4d2027b68af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63883186111dfb6253c7551f9568f4d2027b68af/0_115_4319_2591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Omar with his cousin Abdullah:\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Omar with his cousin Abdullah: \u2018The first thing I want to do is take a shower and sleep in the home.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The small crowd in the tea shop was too much for the teenager, who soon turned to his cousin to ask if they could slip away.

All the 50 boys now brought to the UK by Safe Passage were invited to the welcome party, but many could not attend because of the start of the new school term. </p> <p>\u201cThey are slowly putting together the pieces of their lives,\u201d said Red Godfrey-Sagoo, the head of Safe Passage. </p> <p>\u201cThe journey for the child has actually only just started. This day, arriving in the UK, is the first day of a different journey, which is quite fraught.

What would stop other countries from asking the same exceptional status?\u201d he said.</p> <p>Instead, Verhofstadt said, some form of associate status for Britain would be a better approach \u201cwith less obligations but equally less rights\u201d.</p> <p>Vincenzo Scarpetta, of the thinktank Open Europe, <a href=\"http://openeurope.org.uk/today/blog/guy-verhofstadt-european-parliaments-top-brexit-negotiator-mean/\">in a blogpost about the appointment</a>, suggested that Verhofstadt\u2019s role would be less critical than that of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/27/jean-claude-juncker-puts-michel-barnier-in-charge-brexit-talks\">Michel Barnier, the French former EU commissioner who will negotiate on behalf of the more powerful commission</a>.</p> <p>Scarpetta added: \u201cOn a personal level Verhofstadt could be a pretty tough nut to crack. A diehard European federalist, he generally comes across as less pragmatic than Barnier. I would expect Verhofstadt to be particularly intransigent when it comes to splitting the EU\u2019s so-called four freedoms \u2013 that is the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.\u201d</p> <p>Verhofstadt\u2019s appointment was applauded by the Scottish National party. He has backed the SNP\u2019s case for an independent Scotland to be quickly admitted to the EU. In a tweet after it became clear on 24 June that Scotland had voted strongly to remain in the EU, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong that Scotland might be taken out of EU, when it voted to stay. Happy to discuss with Nicola Sturgeon.\u201d</p> <p>Before meeting Scotland\u2019s first minister, late June, he added: \u201cIf Scotland decides to leave the UK, to be an independent state, and they decide to be part of the European union I think there is no big obstacle to do that.\u201d<br></p> <p>It is unclear if a Scottish claim for entry as an independent state will affect the UK\u2019s Brexit negotiations, or the European parliament\u2019s response, but Alyn Smith, the SNP MEP, said he was delighted with the former Belgium premier\u2019s appointment. \u201cGuy\u2019s appointment is good news \u2013 we can do business. He is a long-standing respected MEP. [He] has also proven he is alive to the Scottish question and I have every confidence all the doors we need are open.\u201d </p> <p>Verhofstadt\u2019s appointment was announced after the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, used a breakfast meeting in Downing Street to urge the prime minister to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/donald-tusk-theresa-may-article-50-brexit-negotiations-eu\">press ahead with formal negotiations as soon as possible</a>.</p> <p>Speaking before the pair shared what a spokeswoman said was a friendly breakfast of scrambled eggs and smoked salmon, Tusk said: \u201cThe ball is now in your court.\u201d</p> <p>The spokeswoman said the pair had discussed working together to create a \u201csmooth process for Britain\u2019s exit from the EU but reiterated that May would not invoke article 50, which begins the formal negotiations, before the end of the year.</p> <p>May also discussed with Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/30/five-teenage-boys-arrested-after-man-dies-following-attack-in-essex\">recent attacks on Polish people</a> in the UK, the spokeswoman said. She sought to reassure him that Britain was a \u201ctolerant country\u201d and would remain so outside the EU. She detailed the action the government was taking to crack down on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/hate-crime\">hate crime</a>.</p> <p>With uncertainty over the EU\u2019s future likely to dampen economic confidence, the government could face increasing pressure from the other member states. Other EU leaders will meet in Bratislava next week \u2013 without Britain \u2013 to consider the way forward.</p> <p>But Tusk made clear there could be little progress until article 50 was triggered. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that we are going to discuss our future relations with the UK in Bratislava, because for this, and especially for the start of the negotiations, we need the formal notification, I mean triggering article 50. This is the position shared by all 27 member states. To put it simply, the ball is now in your court. I\u2019m aware that it is not easy but I still hope you will be ready to start the process as soon as possible. I have no doubt that at the end of the day our common strategic goal is to establish the closest possible relations.\u201d</p> <p>With Westminster\u2019s summer recess now over, the government is gearing up for the challenge of Britain\u2019s EU exit. However, May gave little away about her intentions, insisting in the Commons on Wednesday that her government would not give a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/07/theresa-may-not-provide-running-commentary-on-brexit-negotiations-video\">\u201crunning commentary\u201d</a> on the issue.</p> <p>May has made clear that controls on immigration would have to be a key element of any deal, but she does not favour the points-based system that was advocated by many pro-Brexit campaigners in the run-up to the referendum.<br></p> <p>It is also unclear whether May believes Britain can remain a member of the single market after leaving. The Brexit secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/david-davis-vows-to-build-national-consensus-on-brexit\">David Davis</a>, who was asked if Britain could remain inside the single market, said this week: \u201cThe simple truth is that if a requirement of membership is giving up control of our borders, I think that makes it very improbable.\u201d</p> <p>But the prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman subsequently indicated that Davis was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/david-davis-single-market-stance-not-government-policy\">\u201csetting out his opinion\u201d</a> rather than making a statement of government policy \u2013 underlining the tensions that could emerge between the pro-remain prime minister and the pro-Brexit team she has put in charge of negotiating Britain\u2019s departure.</p> <p>May has also insisted that she <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/27/theresa-may-acting-like-tudor-monarch-in-denying-mps-a-vote-over-brexit\">does not see the need</a> for a parliamentary vote to ratify a decision to trigger article 50.</p>",
  "<p>It was supposed to be the substantive counterpoint to a primary season dominated by frivolity, but Wednesday\u2019s national security forum \u2013 hosted by NBC and featuring back-to-back appearances by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump \u2013 was nothing of the sort.</p> <p>To say it wasn\u2019t television news\u2019 finest hour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/for-clinton-a-skirmish-with-history-from-trump-an-ambush-of-the-facts\">would be an understatement</a>.</p> <p>Instead of testing the limits of Trump\u2019s knowledge or probing Clinton to move beyond her standard talking points, the forum\u2019s setup seemed to encourage candidates to assume their usual roles. Trump was allowed to ramble on topics utterly devoid of policy content, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/2/18/11057968/donald-trump-iraq-war-2002\">while occasionally asserting lies as truths</a>; Clinton was forced to repeatedly defend herself against the same accusations regarding her private email server that have plagued her all election cycle. </p> <p>Trump was able to play all his greatest, phoniest hits \u2013 saying, for instance, he was against the war in Iraq all along. <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/2/18/11057968/donald-trump-iraq-war-2002\">That\u2019s a lie</a>, pure and simple, as has been documented by a whole cadre of journalists by now. But NBC moderator Matt Lauer didn\u2019t correct him, instead rerouting the conversation to a soft-ball referendum on Trump\u2019s temperament.</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/331907383771148288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">a tweet in which</a> Trump seemed dismissive of sexual assault in the military came up, the mogul got to have it every which way, saying first that the tweet was \u201ccorrect\u201d, and then that \u201cmany\u201d agree with him, and finally, in so many words, that he no longer supports it. He did the same routine a second time when asked about his relationship to Vladimir Putin, saying first that Putin\u2019s favorable impression of him would not have any impact on him and then saying the exact opposite thing in the next sentence: \u201cIf he says great things about me, I\u2019m going to say great things about him.\u201d No matter, both Trump and Lauer had moved on.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/donald-trump-putin-more-of-a-leader-of-his-country-than-obama-for-us-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/525fa\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2700631\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump: Putin is far more of a leader of his country than Obama is for US \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"NBC News\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d10cdae4b0c1d95ae14821\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/donald-trump-putin-more-of-a-leader-of-his-country-than-obama-for-us-video\">Trump: Putin is more of a leader of his country than Obama is for US \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The approach allows listeners to hear whatever they want to hear, something Trump, in his myth-making book, The Art of the Deal, touted as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/01/trump-immigration-code-switching-not-skillful-disingenuous\">one of his greatest strengths</a>. It also gives Trump an opportunity to parrot compliments he\u2019s received \u2013 in this case, from Putin.</p> <p>Lauer\u2019s not a national security expert and doesn\u2019t have a reputation for being hard-hitting. But even with that disposition and background, he still should have managed to call Trump out some of these things.</p> <p>Yet to simply blame Lauer for what\u2019s widely considered to be a missed opportunity is to miss the forest for the trees. Sure, he failed to elicit a substantive policy discussion from Trump. But he also failed where every other major moderator has failed as well. If there\u2019s a formula for stopping Trump from coasting on insults and babble, nobody\u2019s found it yet, and playing PolitiFact in real time is no easy feat.</p> <p>There were a few places where Trump walked himself into a corner, like his comment about how, under President Obama, military generals have been \u201creduced to rubble\u201d and things have eroded to a point where \u201cit\u2019s embarrassing\u201d. Those remarks came off as deeply unpatriotic. But any resulting controversy, like the comment he made last year about John McCain not being a war hero, will fade.</p> <p>Trump is winning the military vote handily, after all, as every Republican candidate in recent elections has. It\u2019s a vote that\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/military-communities-favor-trump-over-clinton-n644176\">disproportionately white, male and lacking a college degree</a> \u2013 which is to say, it checks all the right boxes for him. And no outlier comment about generals in a policy forum is going to change that.<br></p> <p>What does matter and should scare Clinton is that she just got an ugly preview of the coming debates: despite establishment insistence that Trump\u2019s playground-style taunts won\u2019t work on her in the general, we saw during Wednesday night\u2019s forum that they can.</p> <p>Trump is already using such tactics against Clinton, as he did at a town hall in Virginia earlier this week when he made a gendered dig about how <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-putin-clinton-laughs-2016-9\">\u201cPutin looks at her and he laughs\u201d</a>. He did it when he observed her to be lacking a <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/09/donald-trump-says-clinton-doesnt-look-presidential.html\">\u201cpresidential look\u201d</a>, and when he insinuates she\u2019s untrustworthy through silly monikers like Crooked Hillary. It\u2019s an approach Paul Krugman referred to earlier this week as the politics of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/05/opinion/hillary-clinton-gets-gored.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fpaul-krugman&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=opinion&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection\">innuendo</a>. It\u2019s not just Trump who\u2019s employing it, but he\u2019s channeling it more effectively than anyone else in recent memory.</p> <p>It was evident during the forum on Wednesday night, and it was evident afterwards, when Clinton\u2019s camp came after Trump on all the inconsistencies he spouted to Lauer, attacking his defense of sexual assault in the military, his embrace of Putin and his tarring of military generals. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the chairman of the Republican party attacked Clinton for, of all things, having <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Reince/status/773694140404170752\">\u201cno smile\u201d</a>. She was left playing defense against innuendo at an event <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chucktodd/status/773673483884720129?lang=en\">expressly billed</a> as the antidote to vapid dialogue. If that\u2019s any indication of what we\u2019re in for this fall, Clinton and anyone in support of examining actual political policy needs to come up with a new strategy.</p>",

I understand that one person was completing the process of naturalisation before their British-born partner died; they were then told that, as a result of their partner\u2019s death, it could no longer be concluded. They should have been allowed to finish this process. Then, once they had completely exhausted all appeals, the government should have given them the option of returning to Jamaica themselves, independently, paying for their own flights. This would have allowed them to make applications to return to the UK if they wanted to.</p> <p>By deporting them, their right to apply and return has been taken away.</p> <p>Lawyers representing some of those who were targeted were successful on Tuesday evening in challenging the deportation of their clients, with at least seven people taken off the flight.</p> <p>But many more were unsuccessful. It was inappropriate for the UK to gather up so many and such a mix of people \u2013 each facing different circumstances and with a different status \u2013 in one big sweep, and to charter an aircraft to deport them all at once. Because of the way in which they were removed, the assumption made by some people is that they were all criminals and all in the UK illegally. This has stigmatised everyone on the flight.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One had arrived to sign in with his baby. While detaining him, the Home Office called social services to take the baby</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many will have built lives in the UK, have not known Jamaica as an adult and have no family there. Their families in the UK have been ripped apart. On their arrival in Jamaica they will be vulnerable and may face homelessness, poverty and destitution.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning I spoke to the partner of one of the people on the flight. He, like all asylum seekers, was required by the Home Office to sign in frequently at reporting centres or police stations. She told me that two weeks ago, when signing in, he was seized, handcuffed and sustained injuries, and taken to an immigration removal centre. He has a heart condition and diabetes and was subsequently taken to a hospital where his injuries were photographed. He had been signing in every week and electronically tagged for two years.</p> <p>A few months ago he went through an appeal, and then a fresh appeal was refused, as well as a judicial review. His partner said he had access to a phone and was able to call her from the plane; he told her he had been driven right up to the plane, surrounded by police and taken to an undisclosed location. Each of the people on the flight was taken on board one by one.</p> <p>In the background, as he spoke, she could hear crying, screaming and shouting from others on the flight. The pleas and cries will haunt her for ever, she added; the heart has been ripped out of her family. She and her partner have seven children and four grandchildren between them, and her partner was their only grandfather. This is one family\u2019s story, but there will be many others like this.</p> <p>Among those rounded up to be removed are a former soldier who served in the British army, a father of three who arrived in the UK aged four, and one who had arrived to sign in with his baby in a pushchair. While detaining him, the Home Office called social services to take his baby.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/02/dozens-of-asylum-seekers-crammed-into-single-home-office-property\">Dozens of asylum seekers crammed into single Home Office property</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This \u201csnatching\u201d of people with no warning who are attending their routine signing-in appointments could make individuals fearful of attending putting them in a Catch-22 position.

Despite assurances during the EU referendum campaign that there would be a fairer response towards Commonwealth citizens if the country voted in favour of Brexit, this is clearly not the case.</p> <p>It seems like those seen as easy targets are being rounded up for mass forced removals in order to reduce immigration numbers, with no consideration for personal circumstances, health, family, length of time spent in the UK, or whether they were minors when they arrived. There also seems to be no consideration for human rights; article 8 of the European convention on human rights, for instance, which covers family and private life.</p> <p>It is clear that anybody not naturalised is at risk and needs to seek urgent legal advice. Those targeted were given just two weeks between being detained and deported to challenge, seek advice and legal representation. Legal aid cuts are also an issue; these mean that those most likely to face injustice have the least access to justice. Justice should not be a privilege for the wealthy, and given the time constraints faced by those deported, there was very little chance for communities to respond, raise awareness and campaign.</p> <p>It is also of grave concern that airline carriers participate in forced removals and in future any campaign to challenge such inhumane deportations must also consider the role of the aviation sector and airlines. There must also be calls for the Jamaican government to refuse to collude with racist immigration laws and policies that inhumanely target individuals and destroy families and to refuse to accept such chartered removal flights, carrying people against their will, to land on Jamaican soil.</p> <p>In 2010, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/16/g4s-guards-found-not-guilty-manslaughter-jimmy-mubenga\" title=\"\">Jimmy Mubenga</a> died on a deportation flight while being restrained by security guards. The fact that he was on a plane with paying passengers meant there were witnesses to the truth, but on flights like the one today, there are no paying passengers or independent witnesses.</p> <p>Despite the short amount of notice regarding the planned deportation, campaigners responded quickly. A <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/home-office-stop-the-charter-flight-to-jamaica-7th-september\" title=\"\">petition that was started</a> on Tuesday has attracted over 2,000 signatures. The comments include reports from family members whose loved ones where taken on Wednesday morning or who have family members who have experienced similar targeting in the past.</p> <p>An emergency demonstration was held outside the Jamaican high commission on Tuesday, and BARAC (Black Activists Rising Against Cuts) UK in collaboration with other community activists from across the country on Tuesday evening did an emergency call-out for people to contact Heathrow airport and the duty immigration officer to complain about the forced removal using the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23jamaica50&amp;src=typd\" title=\"\">#Jamaica50</a>. BARAC is planning another demonstration in the next couple of weeks. When individuals are deported on scheduled flights, it is also possible to lobby the airline or aircraft carrier.</p> <p>This inhumane targeting and tarnishing is not acceptable. It isn\u2019t just those deported who are affected but also the families left behind \u2013 the children left without parents and the loved ones who are separated.

Aleppo, formerly Syria\u2019s largest city, has been the worst hit area during the country\u2019s war.<br></p> <p>But Johnson didn\u2019t know what Aleppo was. </p> <p>\u201cAbout?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cAleppo,\u201d replied Barnicle.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what is Aleppo?\u201d asked Johnson.<br></p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d responded Barnicle.<br></p> <p> \u201cNo,\u201d said Johnson.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Morning_Joe/status/773851435477762048\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikebarnicle\">@mikebarnicle</a>: What would you do, if you were elected, about Aleppo? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GovGaryJohnson\">@GovGaryJohnson</a>: And what is Aleppo?  <a href=\"https://t.co/ZbqO5RAEsk\">https://t.co/ZbqO5RAEsk</a></p>&mdash; Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Morning_Joe/status/773851435477762048\">September 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p> Barnicle explained that Aleppo is in Syria and \u201cit\u2019s the epicenter of the refugee crisis\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cOK, got it. Got it,\u201d replied Johnson, before continuing to say of Syria: \u201cIt\u2019s a mess\u201d, and that the US should join with Russia to diplomatically end the war.</p> <p>\u201cNo one is taking this more seriously than me, I feel horrible,\u201d Johnson said to Bloomberg Politics\u2019 Mark Halperin, who was also a guest on Morning Joe. \u201cI have to get smarter, and that\u2019s just part of the process.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis morning, I began my day by setting aside any doubt that I\u2019m human. Yes, I understand the dynamics of the Syrian conflict \u2013 I talk about them every day. But hit with \u2018What about Aleppo?\u2019, I immediately was thinking about an acronym, not the Syrian conflict. I blanked. It happens, and it will happen again during the course of this campaign.</p> <p>As governor, there were many things I didn\u2019t know off the top of my head. But I succeeded by surrounding myself with the right people, getting to the bottom of important issues, and making principled decisions. It worked. That is what a president must do.\u201d</p> <p>But Johnson\u2019s highly embarrassing lapse immediately resulted in watchers declaring it the nail in the coffin for his campaign.</p> <p>\u201cWell, that ends him,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tribelaw/status/773851134586974208\">tweeted Laurence Tribe</a>, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School.</p> <p>\u201cYou can look at a map and find Aleppo,\u201d Clinton said during her first formal press conference, in front of her campaign plane on the tarmac in White Plains, New York.</p> <p>\u201cIt was astonishing to watch Gary Johnson effectively end his campaign,\u201d said Rick Tyler, a former top Ted Cruz aide and MSNBC political analyst.</p> <p>\u201cThe little five-year-old boy that was literally on every newspaper was in Aleppo. He absolutely had to know what that is as a candidate for president.\u201d</p> <p>Tyler said Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump had underperformed during NBC\u2019s military forum on Wednesday night \u2013 something Johnson could have taken advantage of.</p> <p>\u201cThe opportunity that he blew was astonishing,\u201d Tyler said.</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s Gary Johnson\u2019s chance to say: \u2018If you don\u2019t like what you saw last night, I will be honored to receive your vote, and he had an opportunity to perform and is worthy of the vote.</p> <p>\u201cAnd now the only question is where do Gary Johnson\u2019s votes go.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>An undercover officer infiltrated a group of Islamic State supporters attempting to smuggle themselves out of the UK to Syria in the back of a lorry, an Old Bailey jury has been told.</p> <p>Anas Abdalla, 26, from Acocks Green, Birmingham, was discovered in an empty space inside a cargo trailer at Dover port in April 2015 in the company of three other men.</p> <p>One of the others, Gabriel Rasmus, 29, from Lozells, Birmingham, has already pleaded guilty, the court heard, to preparing acts of terrorism, the same offence under section 5(1) of the 2006 Terrorism Act with which Abdalla is charged.</p> <p>Abdalla, who was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, and first came to the UK as an asylum seeker, denies the charge. He claims he was fleeing Britain because he was being \u201charassed and subject to oppressive treatment\u201d by MI5.</p> <p>Outlining the evidence against him, Duncan Atkinson QC, for the prosecution, said that Abdalla held a valid UK passport when he was arrested and, like Rasmus, carried a rucksack containing an iPhone wrapped in foil, a second Nokia mobile, ID cards, \u00a3520 in cash, \u20ac250, waterproof clothing, walking boots and a G-Shock watch.</p> <p>Abdalla and Rasmus, Atkinson said, were planning to travel to Syria via Bulgaria and Turkey \u201cto join forces with so-called Islamic State and to offer their services, with their lives if necessary, to engage in acts of terrorism\u201d. Isis, the prosecutor reminded the jury, is a banned organisation and Abdalla, he said, was preparing to commit acts of terrorism in Syria. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Rasmus had been under police investigation for some time, particularly through meetings conducted by an undercover officer known by the pseudonym \u201cMuhamed\u201d who was gathering information about alleged terrorist activity.</p> <p>The jury are due to hear recordings made by Muhamed of conversations in which Rasmus repeatedly refers to \u201cthere\u201d or \u201cgoing there\u201d \u2013 references, it is said, to Syria. </p> <p>Muhamed also met Abdalla, who told him that \u201cEurope held nothing for him\u201d and that he loathed his work in IT because he had to associate with non-Muslims, the jury heard. \u201cHe said he had been called on to go to Syria to fight and wanted to do so,\u201d Atkinson said. Abdalla, it is alleged, expressed support for Isis.</p> <p>One of the other men detained in the back of the lorry was Mahamuud Diini. He, the court was told, had also been trying to leave the country covertly. Diini, however, has been prosecuted previously for seeking to travel to Syria but was acquitted. </p> <p>The prosecution will challenge Abdalla\u2019s claim that he was fleeing from security force harassment and attempt to demonstrate that difficulties in his life were due to other causes. The court was told that he did not answer interview questions after his arrest and developed his reason for leaving the country later. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The undercover officer, the court was told, had been tasked with gathering information on alleged terrorist activity. \u201cIn cases involving allegations of serious or organised criminality, the use of undercover officers is a lawful and legitimate means of obtaining vital intelligence and evidence,\u201d Atkinson explained.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe use and conduct of undercover officers is regulated by statute and there are strict rules which define the parameters of what an undercover officer can do or say in a particular situation.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, the rules permit the undercover officer to appear to support the beliefs and actions of those he is investigating and to show \u2018necessary enthusiasm\u2019. This means he can agree with them when they talk and help them by giving them a lift, for example, but not actually engage with them in committing a crime. Those rules were followed in this case.\u201d</p> <p>The case continues.</p>",

Watching May at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/07/pmqs-may-corbyn-statement-brexit-australia-dashes-hopes-of-quick-brexit-trade-deal-with-uk-politics-live\" title=\"\">prime minister\u2019s questions</a>, it was hard to escape the feeling we\u2019ve been a little hasty.</p> <p>Diplomatically, the performance could be described as \u201cdisappointing\u201d. She avoided pretty much every question she was asked, instead reaching for a series of weak, pre-written putdowns. \u201cEven on rolling stock, Labour are a laughing stock!\u201d she recited awkwardly, prompting forced chuckling from the government benches that sounded even more unconvincing than usual. It\u2019s possible that a stronger script and slicker delivery might have made her chosen strategy a success. As things were, though, she seemed shifty, uncomfortable and out of her depth on important policy issues such as Brexit and housing.</p> <p>In a particularly bizarre moment, she answered a serious question from Corbyn about housebuilding by quoting a sarcastic response the Labour leader had received on Twitter: \u201cLewis writes: \u2018Does [May] know in a recent poll on who would make a better prime minister, \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 scored higher than Jeremy Corbyn?\u201d she reeled off in her characteristically stilted style.

As it turns out, Lewis Collins \u2013 who uses the handle @swingaleg \u2013 has a fairly colourful Twitter history. A few days ago, he responded to a news story about a racist attack <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theMattachines/status/773596684920229888\" title=\"\">by opining</a>: \u201cEvery time a Polish person is lamped, it will always be considered a Brexit hate crime.

In one particularly delightful interaction he informed me I was \u201cmentally deficient\u201d. The account has now been deleted from Twitter, presumably in an attempt to minimise the backlash, but it seems likely the examples I\u2019ve quoted weren\u2019t isolated incidents.</p> <p>All of which begs the question: why didn\u2019t May bother checking just who she was quoting? Given the political attention that has been devoted to social media trolling in recent months, it seems a fairly stunning oversight. <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2015/12/are-jeremy-corbyns-supporters-really-sexist\" title=\"\">Corbyn has been blamed for abusive tweets sent by people claiming to back him</a>, despite issuing social media guidelines urging supporters to interact politely.

At the time, her tenure as home secretary was widely regarded as an utter disaster. Her attempts to tackle immigration were both <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/22/go-home-billboards-pulled\" title=\"\">dystopian and cruel</a> and hopelessly ineffectual according to her own criteria. She <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/23/theresa-may-home-secretary-government-migration-target-fail-likely\" title=\"\">missed every target she ever set herself</a>. When you think about it, it\u2019s hard to understand how she\u2019s come to be seen as something of a political saviour.</p> <p>Charitably, you could suggest that her failures, past and present, illustrate how difficult being a frontbench politician actually is. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes; and most of us don\u2019t have the fate of an entire country in our hands. Maybe the elusive quality of consistent political competence is actually a myth, and the goal is simply to project the appearance of having your shit together.</p> <p>If Theresa May is faking it, perhaps they all are. What a genuinely terrifying thought.</p>",
  "<p>My uncle used to have a plum orchard, which I played in with my cousins. At the base of the orchard there was a shallow, snaking river from where we\u2019d collect the mud to make our famous \u201cmud plum pies\u201d \u2013 they were one of our favourite things to make every autumn. The recipe would vary from one day to the next, but in principle the pie would consist of over-ripe, wasp-eaten plums bound together in a smooth, grey, clay mud. If we had time we might embellish the pie with a generous coating of wood shavings, but that kind of finish was reserved for special occasions.</p> <p>Nine times out of 10, the mud plum pies would be hurled at someone, long before they got a chance to be cooked, and all too often, that was at the farm boy from down the road (sorry, farm boy). But once in a while we\u2019d arrange a few around the edge of a big camp fire and watch them bake. I remember them looking weirdly appetising; the mud was all cracked like good-looking pastry, covered with all the blistered sticky fruit.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always been a fan of plums with roast pork. That orchard would have been a brilliant place to keep pigs \u2013 there were always so many windfall plums \u2013 their meat would have no doubt been delicious. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Sandy_and_Black\">Oxford sandy and black</a>, a traditional breed of pig we keep at River Cottage, would have suited the orchard perfectly. They are widely nicknamed the \u201cplum pudding pig\u201d owing to their colouring: chestnut red with splashes of black.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/01/unusual-herb-pairings-recipes-pear-rosemary-apple-sage-blueberries-thyme-gill-meller-cook-residency\">How to pair fruit and herbs with three recipes | Cook residency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It seems fitting to include a plum pudding, of the wholly edible sort, in this week\u2019s batch of recipes. It\u2019s a bit of a timeless classic: plum and almond tart. I\u2019ve spiked the frangipane \u2013 a rich almond paste \u2013 with star anise, a pungently sweet and aromatic spice that complements plums beautifully. To up the ante, I like to spread the base of the pastry case with a good plum or damson jam, bakewell-style.</p> <p>Plums, damsons and greengages are all wonderful eaten raw, but there are plenty of ways to cook them, particularly if you have a glut. In a village near me, there is a damson tree; the fruit is bruised blue and black with silver dusted skin. By the end of the season much of the fruit is blemished, split or scarred, but still it\u2019s ripe and sweet and there\u2019s lots of it. It\u2019s these less-perfect damsons that I use to make ice-cream for the freezer or a rich fruity jam \u2013 my recipe is below.</p> <p>Plums are not limited to puddings, however. I like to cook them down with chilli and garlic to create a strongly flavoured panful and to pair this with labneh, a Lebanese-style strained yoghurt cheese. The combination of the plums\u2019 intensity and the cooling tang of the labneh sits beautifully atop a piece of toast, which absorbs all the rich juices. Quite the autumn lunch ...</p> <h2><strong>Plums with labneh, rosemary chilli and toast</strong></h2> <p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br>12 plums<br>30g butter, for frying<br>1 tbsp olive oil, for frying<br>1 small red chilli, deseeded and thinly sliced<br>2 sprigs rosemary<br>Salt and black pepper<br>1 tbsp honey<br>4 slices of bread</p> <p><strong>For the labneh</strong><br>500ml natural yoghurt<br>2 pinches of salt</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf74fc1a3291bf4b388df3c7cb618de7f4a8bf28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf74fc1a3291bf4b388df3c7cb618de7f4a8bf28/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plums with labneh, rosemary chilli and toast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The cooling tang of the labneh sits beautifully with the chilli-spiked plums.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1</strong> Start by making the labneh. This can be done several days in advance or at least 12 hours before you eat it. Put the yoghurt in a bowl and stir in the salt. Line a sieve with a square of clean muslin, cheesecloth or even a clean thin cotton cloth. Spoon the salted yoghurt into the centre of the cloth, then gather up the sides. Tie the cloth at the top and hang up to drain over a bowl for 6\u20138 hours, or overnight. I do this by hanging in my fridge with a bowl set underneath to catch the liquid.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Once drained, untie and lift the labneh from the cloth into a bowl. Refrigerate until needed.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Halve the plums and remove the stones. Heat a heavy-based pan over a medium heat and add the butter and olive oil. When bubbling, add the plums, cut-side down. Caramelise a little then carefully turn over. Add the chilli and rosemary. Season lightly. Once the fruit is tender, trickle over the honey. Grill the bread on both sides.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> To serve, spread the labneh on the toast and top with the plums, trickled with some of the syrupy, herby juices from the pan.</p> <h2><strong>Plum and almond tart with star anise and vanilla</strong></h2> <p><strong>Serves 8-10</strong><br>90g icing sugar<br>340g plain flour<br>170g butter, cubed and chilled, plus extra for greasing<br>1 egg<br>2 tbsp iced water</p> <p><strong>For the frangipane</strong><br>110g unsalted butter<br>110g golden caster sugar<br>\u00bd vanilla pod, seeds scraped<br>2 star anise, finely crushed<br>3 eggs, beaten<br>110g ground almonds<br>12-16 ripe plums <br>4 tbsp plum jam (see below)<br>A handful of flaked almonds</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Combine the icing sugar and plain flour, then rub in the chilled butter until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs (you can also do this in a food processor). Add the egg and iced water, and stir to combine. Tip out the dough and bring it together with your hands, kneading lightly to achieve a smooth finish. Tightly wrap the pastry in clingfilm, then put it in the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Set the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to 2-3mm thick. Grease and flour a 28cm loose-bottomed tart tin, then lay over the pastry, tucking it into the corners and leaving an overhang. Line the pastry case with parchment and baking beans. Blind-bake the tart case for 25 minutes, then remove the baking beans, trim the overhang, and return to the oven for 10 minutes, or until the base is just starting to colour. Remove and set aside.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> For the frangipane, cream the butter, sugar, vanilla seeds and star anise until light and fluffy. Add the eggs and ground almonds, then mix until well combined.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Halve and stone the plums. Spread the jam over the base of the pastry case then spoon in the frangipane mix. Arrange the plums on top. Push them in lightly with your fingers. Scatter with the flaked almonds.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Bake for 25\u201335 minutes or until golden and set on the outside but still a little soft in the middle. Allow to cool for 30 minutes before serving.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"54dfb33d073230f5d17c26f05589bd975c1280f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54dfb33d073230f5d17c26f05589bd975c1280f8/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"GILL MELLER and his dog go for a walk through the woods\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gill Meller: \u2018Use less-than-perfect damsons to make ice-cream for the freezer or a rich fruity jam.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Plum jam</strong></h2> <p><strong>Makes about 6 jars<br></strong>1kg plums<br>1kg preserving sugar</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Wash, halve and stone the plums.

Gently simmer for 30\u201340 minutes, or until the fruit and skins are lovely and tender. Stir in the sugar. Bring the pot to a rapid boil and cook until setting point is reached \u2013 around 10-12 minutes. Setting point for jam is about 105C/220F. Use the wrinkle test: spoon a small amount of the hot jam on to a fridge-cold plate, let it stand for a moment, then push it with the tip of your finger. If the surface wrinkles, the jam is ready.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Remove the pan from the heat and pour gently into clean, sterilised jars. Seal and label while the jars are warm.

Ice or cold packs are generally used, which can freeze the vaccine to a temperature lower than considered thermally stable, and leads to vaccines losing potency. </p> <p>In 2015, an estimated 19.4 million children worldwide failed to receive routine immunisation services, with more than 60% of these living in developing countries. Figures suggest that an additional 1.5 million deaths could be avoided if global vaccination systems improve. </p> <p>Broadway\u2019s hi-tech, rechargeable cooling system was inspired by an invention developed by Albert Einstein in  the 1920s. The device was originally intended to provide electricity-free refrigeration, and required only a heat source to drive a chemical process. </p> <p>The Isobar is specifically designed to maintain stable temperature control between 2C (35F) and 8C (46.4F) during the \u201cfinal mile\u201d distribution of vaccine in remote regions without power.

Directly in front of its courthouse, a monument to the cause reads: \u201cLest We Forget.\u201d </p> <p>The city was also home to a branch of the Standard Oil company, but Louisiana\u2019s oil and gas industry has struggled in recent years, leading to an economic downturn that affected funding for public services such as indigent defense. Today, casinos and strip clubs light up its mid-rise skyline, and billboards for lawyers (\u201cOne Call, Y\u2019all!\u201d) line the highways.</p> <p>On a humid day in June, many of those lawyers are gathered for a luncheon thrown by the Shreveport Bar Association. Dressed in seersucker suits and bow ties, they are crowded around the buffet, spooning fried catfish and black-eyed peas on to their plates. Between bites, everyone is commiserating about the public defender\u2019s funding crisis, and how ill-equipped they are to fill in. \u201cI just got another one this week!\u201d says Richard Lamb, a tax attorney who admits he has never argued a case in court.</p> <p>The analogies seem to come easy: </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like asking a dentist to do heart surgery,\u201d Lamb says. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like if we told a prosecutor to do a medical malpractice suit,\u201d says Goodwin, the insurance attorney. </p> <p>\u201cWhat if private lawyers were appointed to be DAs?\u201d says Steve Baker, an adoption attorney, later in the day. \u201cWe\u2019d probably just dismiss a lot of the cases, and they don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p> <p>Another civil attorney, Jim McMichael, chimes in with a funny story about how a defendant put an arm around his appointed lawyer\u2019s shoulder and said: \u201cWould it help if I told the judge that I also thought you were incompetent?\u201d</p> <p>Goodwin \u2013 whose former client Norman Williams Jr made a deal with the district attorney to testify against another defendant and is now doing five years in prison \u2013 says he cannot tell if this is all a comedy or a tragedy. \u201cWe\u2019re sharing laughs over beers about how my friend was assigned to represent a pimp,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then again, someone\u2019s liberty is at stake here.\u201d</p> <p>On at least three occasions in the past, Caddo Parish has taken the same draft-a-lawyer route out of a public defender crisis \u2013 and criminal defendants have fared far worse than Williams. In 1984, the local bar had divided all of Shreveport\u2019s lawyers alphabetically, just as judges did again this year, to represent the indigent. In one murder case, a man named Glenn Ford was randomly assigned to be defended by an oil and gas attorney and a slip-and-fall insurance attorney. They failed to challenge prosecutors\u2019 selection of an all-white jury, which then found Ford guilty after deliberating for only three hours. He spent the last three decades of his life on death row before being exonerated in March 2014.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57e91d8314e7682513122a2d90c0ffe99bf80028\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57e91d8314e7682513122a2d90c0ffe99bf80028/137_0_1857_1114/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Baker, adoption attorney in Shreveport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Baker, who practices adoption law in Shreveport, said of the crisis: \u2018What if private lawyers were appointed to be DAs?

The state of Louisiana never provided compensation to him or his family.</p> <p>This time around, to better prepare their lawyers for these assigned cases, the local bar association planned a seminar on criminal law for non-criminal attorneys. (One flyer read: \u201cThis Will Sell Out, So Make Your Reservation Now!\u201d)</p> <p>On a Friday in May, more than 20 private attorneys filed into the basement of the Caddo Parish courthouse, where they learned the \u201cDo\u2019s and Don\u2019t\u2019s of Providing Effective Assistance\u201d in criminal cases. Over a three-hour period, a judge, a representative from the DA\u2019s office, a former DA and a former public defender showed them PowerPoint presentations on how to interview a client (compare what the client is saying with what you know from the police report), how to visit a jail (show your bar card) and how to file basic motions. They also provided examples of the differences between criminal and civil rules for evidence. In the final few minutes, volunteers were chosen to practice their newfound skills in several courtroom scenarios, including a mock arraignment and bail hearing.</p> <p>\u201cWe ran out of time before all the questions could get answered,\u201d says Jim McMichael, the bar association attorney who helped organize the seminar. \u201cPeople were so concerned, saying: \u2018I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Some in attendance were unimpressed with the crash course. \u201cIn three hours, they\u2019re supposed to become criminal defenders?\u201d says Henry Walker, a longtime criminal defense attorney in Shreveport and the former president of the Louisiana criminal defense bar. \u201cThey just learned how to trust the DA, make quick deals, dispose of the case and go back to their real jobs.\u201d</p> <p>But Judge Brady O\u2019Callaghan, who helped implement Caddo Parish\u2019s system of appointing private lawyers, believes many of them are more capable than they have given themselves credit for. \u201cIf someone can depose a doctor for five hours, they can do a plea hearing,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never known a lawyer to tell a paying client: \u2018I can\u2019t learn this, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s view, all these lawyers have a professional obligation to offer their assistance, when needed, to the poor. \u201cThis is not something we\u2019re ecstatic about,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re just picking out of a hat and saying: \u2018Hey, let\u2019s see what happens\u2019 \u2026 But as a temporary solution, it is better than either releasing these defendants from jail or incarcerating them without any lawyer.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>This is not something we\u2019re ecstatic about.

The court also does not pay them to take the cases and rarely offers funds for hiring investigators or expert witnesses. They have little incentive, in other words, to investigate crime scenes, call witnesses, meet clients and their families, and study up on the developments in criminal law in the years since they left law school.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to prioritize our paying cases, there\u2019s no denying it,\u201d says David Turansky, a former divorce lawyer who now focuses on personal injury cases. \u201cWe\u2019re just not going to spend our time learning constitutional law or what a \u2018Batson challenge\u2019 is.\u201d</p> <p>Steve Baker, a chatty adoption attorney with a thick book of New Yorker lawyer cartoons in his office, says that it would be unethical for him to take the cases. His strategy has been to object to the appointments outright, and to share useful legal motions and pleadings with his colleagues so they can get out of them, too.</p> <p>In one case, Baker was appointed to represent a defendant who faced life in prison \u2013 but he took no action and never visited the person in jail (the case was reassigned to another lawyer more than seven months later). In another, a partner at his firm instructed his son, a junior associate, to walk down to the courthouse and take a plea as quickly as possible.</p> <p>\u201cMost of us are just trying to get in, get out,\u201d he says.</p> <p>On 1 July, Louisiana\u2019s new fiscal year began, and public defense offices in several parishes received a small influx of funds. National attention on the crisis waned, and in Caddo Parish and elsewhere the public defenders have temporarily reduced their waitlists and stopped actively appointing non-criminal attorneys.</p> <p>But because the fundamentals of how the state funds public defense \u2013 primarily through traffic tickets \u2013 have not changed, the defenders say their money will inevitably run dry in the course of only a few months. In Caddo, any private attorneys who have already been assigned cases still have to see them through, and the appointments may resume later in the year.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying not to have to do this,\u201d says Pam Smart, the district\u2019s chief public defender, referring to the appointment of non-criminal attorneys. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to always be teetering on the edge of it.\u201d</p> <h2>Prosecutors play defense</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/la-winn-public-defenders/\" data-alt=\"winn parish graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/la-winn-public-defenders/\">winn parish graphic</a> </figure>  <p>A few hours to the south-east, in an office decorated with a wall-sized map of the state of Louisiana, a lawyer named J Keith Gates sits behind two heaps of files: one for his job as a prosecutor, the other for his job as a public defender.</p> <p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s all courtroom work,\u201d he says, pulling a file from each stack to show their similarities. \u201cThere\u2019s no conflict unless you\u2019re prosecuting and defending at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>It is a situation practically unheard of elsewhere in the US \u2013 a half-prosecutor, half-defender \u2013 but in Winn Parish, where the funding crisis left the public defender\u2019s office even more decimated than in Caddo, it was perhaps the only option.</p> <p>Last year, the Winn public defender saw its staff of three attorneys, two investigators, and two secretaries slashed to one part-time lawyer \u2013 a former Louisiana State University football player named Herman Castete \u2013 one part-time investigator and a part-time assistant.</p> <p>Castete implemented a waitlist, and poor defendants in conflict cases were sitting in jail without an attorney. \u201cIt may be impossible for the public defender\u2019s office to remain open,\u201d he wrote in an <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/documents/3001010-8th-District-Restriction-of-Services-Plan#.2gWztCIw4\">internal report</a> to the state public defender board. \u201cThere is simply no money available.\u201d</p> <p>To temporarily resolve that situation, the district judge, Jacque Derr, began appointing attorneys from the private bar, just like in Caddo Parish. But Winn is much more rural, with fewer available lawyers, so Derr had to take the additional measure of enlisting Gates. </p> <p>It is against Louisiana Public Defender Board policy for anyone serving with any public defender\u2019s office to also serve as a prosecutor within the same district. But in this case, the defender himself, Castete, had <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/documents/3001012-8th-District-Prosecutor-Exemption-Request#.fCNf7i9TK\">signed on to</a> the idea. </p> <p>Gates says that he, Derr, Castete and the DA are all very diligent about avoiding potential conflicts of interest. As city prosecutor, he mostly handles minor cases brought to him by the city police (battery, disturbing the peace, DUI, shoplifting, theft), while in his new role as a district defender he is handling more serious felonies (armed robbery, weapons crimes, drug crimes). If there is any overlap, he has promised to recuse himself. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the appearance of impropriety,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"677649798d96f3256aa4af4baa5f2a031f7cd2c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/677649798d96f3256aa4af4baa5f2a031f7cd2c0/159_0_1623_974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"shreveport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The appointed lawyers say their lack of experience is only part of the problem.

He plays for the other team,\u201d Singer says. </p> <p>For example, many defendants charged with felonies in district court, where Gates would be their defender, have also been charged with misdemeanors in city court, where he is the prosecutor. In short, Gates could have defendants whom he has both prosecuted and defended. </p> <p>Derr, whose chambers are decorated with a sign reading \u201cBe Still And Know That I Am Boss\u201d, agrees there is a conflict \u2013 but adds: \u201cNobody\u2019s ever said, \u2018Hey, judge, he prosecuted me, I don\u2019t want him defending me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Besides, says Derr, there are more pressing issues for Winn Parish to resolve than Gates\u2019s dual role \u2013 like whether the public defense crisis will slow down the very important prosecution of Kenneth Bratton, a defendant whom the judge calls \u201ca one-man serial crime wave\u201d. Bratton has most recently been accused of at least three counts of burglary, three counts of trespassing and damage to property, and stealing gasoline. He also led the sheriff\u2019s office on a nine-day manhunt.</p> <p>\u201cAin\u2019t no question that dude did it,\u201d says Derr, who will be presiding over Bratton\u2019s case.</p> <p>The only problem is that Bratton has been sitting in jail for over a year without an attorney, trying to write his own legal motions, because the defender\u2019s office is so undermanned. In order to make sure that he has no constitutional claim to be released, the judge first tried to appoint two civil rights attorneys from New Orleans \u2013 without notifying them. They found out and objected.</p> <p>Anna Lellelid, one of the attorneys conscripted from afar, says that being 250 miles away from her client would make her just as ineffective as a non-criminal lawyer. \u201cHe\u2019s just shuffling attorneys around,\u201d she says of Derr, \u201ctrying to do whatever he can to moot the underlying issue, which is the funding of the public defender\u2019s office.\u201d</p> <p>But now the judge is excited about his new strategy: he will have the prosecutor, Gates, represent Bratton.</p> <p>\u201cKenny\u2019s got a lawyer,\u201d Derr says. \u201cSo now we can convict him.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><em>Tomorrow, meet Rhonda Covington, the last line of defense for thousands in a forgotten corner of rural Louisiana</em></li> </ul>",

  "<p>I remember feeling scared after 9/11. A few days after the attacks, a classmate jumped in front of my car and menacingly yelled \u201cgo home\u201d. When I looked out the window, everyone turned away. Around the same time, a McDonald\u2019s cashier nearly refused to sell my dad a cheeseburger. He eventually got the burger, but had lost his appetite.<br></p> <p>But my family got off easy. In the days and weeks following the attack, many religious and ethnic minorities were bullied, harassed and assaulted. On 15 September 2001, Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh American, was <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/americas/2011/09/69911.html\">murdered</a> in a violent hate crime in Mesa, Arizona.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/05/9-11-widow-donald-trump-khan-controversy-familiar-heartbreak-oppose-policies\">I'm a 9/11 widow. Watching the Khans' public heartbreak felt all too familiar | Alissa Torres</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I always thought things would get better. I was born and raised in Virginia, played soccer as a kid and went to high school football games with my friends. Apart from my Sikh articles of faith, a turban and beard, I didn\u2019t feel too different from my peers. America was my home.</p> <p>But 15 years later, I feel worse than I did then. Profiling, hate violence and bigotry now braid through the daily lives of Muslim, Arab, Sikh and South Asian Americans. We are outsiders looking in, forever struggling for equality and understanding.</p> <p>Black parents know the feeling. They\u2019ve long told their children that they\u2019re different and will experience inequities and discrimination in almost every corner of American life. \u201cThe talk\u201d can mean the difference between freedom and incarceration, life and death. </p> <p>We now have our own talk with our kids.</p> <p>It begins with profiling. <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/new-racial-profiling-guidance-retains-broad-exemptions-for-immigration-national-security-b233d3aeba56#.e23km2khx\">Guidelines released by the justice department in 2014</a> explicitly <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/12/8/7351285/racial-profiling\">permit profiling</a> at airports and borders. The guidance likewise <a href=\"https://www.muslimadvocates.org/muslim-advocates-statement-on-the-revised-justice-department-racial-profiling-guidance-to-federal-law-enforcement/\">permits</a> massive data gathering operations, including the monitoring of communities through video surveillance and confidential informants, absent any kind of suspicion. It\u2019s hard to tell our children that we\u2019re equal when we can be stopped by law enforcement officials because of our turbans, hijabs or the color of our skin.</p> <p>There\u2019s also the<a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/lawsuit-challenges-governments-suspicious-activity-report-program\"> suspicious activity reporting program</a>, which directs local law enforcement officers to report activities they believe are indicative of terrorism or illicit activity. Muslim Americans who have <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/gill-v-doj-complaint\">placed large purchase orders</a> for computers at Best Buy, searched for video games online, and <a href=\"https://action.aclu.org/secure/stop-the-suspicion\">purchased bottled water from Costco</a> have found themselves ensnared by this sweeping operation. Others <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/30/terrorist-watch-list-rules-innocent-people\">find their way</a> onto the terrorist watchlist on the basis of a single social media post. Dearborn, Michigan, a city with a population of roughly 100,000 and known for its large Muslim and Arab American community, has <a href=\"http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2014/08/report_more_residents_in_dearb.html\">more watchlisted residents</a> than any other city in the US, except New York.</p> <p>Our adolescents and young adults are acutely vulnerable to profiling. \u201cBecoming confrontational\u201d, \u201cunexpected clashes over ideological differences\u201d or \u201ca new interest in watching or sharing violent material\u201d have been <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/04/16/remarks-assistant-president-homeland-security-and-counterterrorism-lisa-\">construed</a> as indicators of violent extremism and thus often precede a visit from law enforcement authorities. Other countering violent extremism programs have <a href=\"https://cve.fbi.gov/home.html\">used indicators</a> such as \u201ctalking about traveling to places that sound suspicious\u201d, \u201cusing code words or unusual language\u201d and \u201cstudying or taking pictures of potential targets\u201d.</p> <p>Muslim youth who dare to publicly challenge US foreign policy, to speak Arabic in public or to take photos of national monuments run the real risk that they\u2019ll draw the attention of police. In the case of Ahmed Mohamed, the 14-year-old Muslim American student from Irving, Texas, all it took was a passion for engineering and a homemade clock.</p> <p>If \u201cthe talk\u201d begins with profiling, it moves quickly to hate violence \u2013 now mainstream, and intensified and exacerbated by government stigmatization. Islamophobia is higher now than after 9/11 and anti-Muslim violence was <a href=\"http://bridge.georgetown.edu/when-islamophobia-turns-violent-the-2016-u-s-presidential-elections/\">significantly higher in 2015 than it was prior to 9/11</a>, with Muslim Americans about six to nine times more likely to experience violence now than before. Sikh and Arab Americans are often targeted as well; hate has a rapacious appetite. In the wake of the San Bernardino tragedy, for example, Sikh Americans reported a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.in/uzair-hasan-rizvi/post-spike-in-hate-crimes-us-sikh-community-launches-new-tool-t/\">200% rise in hate incidents</a>.</p> <p>Hate crime reporting by police, though, is <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/8247a1d2f76b4baea2a121186dedf768/ap-patchy-reporting-undercuts-national-hate-crimes-count\">voluntary, not mandatory</a>, leaving us unable to even understand the scope of what we endure. The Associated Press recently <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/8247a1d2f76b4baea2a121186dedf768/ap-patchy-reporting-undercuts-national-hate-crimes-count\">found</a> that roughly 17% of all city and county law enforcement agencies nationwide haven\u2019t submitted a single hate crime report in the last six years. Although discrimination and bigotry will never be eradicated, better data would foster awareness and ensure that community leaders and law enforcement have additional resources to combat hate violence at the local level.</p> <p>If we don\u2019t speak to our children, the roles often reverse, and they come to us. <a href=\"http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/3/13/a-go-home-terroristasikhchildrenbulliedtwicenationalaverage.html\">Sikh</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/13215-cair-ca-report-more-than-half-of-california-muslim-students-targeted-by-faith-based-bullying.html\">Muslim American children</a> are bullied at twice the national average. It often begins with belittling jokes and quickly descends to name calling, social exclusion and even physical assault. Bullying correlates with sub-par academic performance, low self-esteem, depression and poor health. Bullying isn\u2019t a rite of passage; it\u2019s a form of hate that, left untreated, continues into adulthood. </p> <p>So when our children pose the granddaddy question of them all and ask us why politicians are so willing to scapegoat and humiliate our communities, our answer is often simple: so many others treat us differently; why wouldn\u2019t they?</p>",
  "<p>Having eased itself in with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/07/joseph-obrien-victorious-phosphoresence-doncaster\" title=\"\">Legends race yesterday</a>, the St Leger meeting at Doncaster begins in earnest today with two Group Two events for fillies on the card, the May Hill Stakes for juveniles and the Park Hill for stayers.</p> <p>Simple Verse, last year\u2019s Leger winner, is the star name on the card in the latter event, as she returns to the scene of her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/23/simple-verse-wins-st-leger-appeal-against-doncaster-demotion\" title=\"\">controversial Classic success 12 months ago</a>. Ralph Beckett\u2019s filly was first across the line, demoted in favour of Bondi Beach by the racecourse stewards and then restored to first place at a subsequent appeal, and went on to confirm her class with victory in the Group One Champion Fillies &amp; Mares Stakes at Ascot on Champions Day.</p> <p>Simple Verse has struggled to pick up where she left off in her four-year-old career, however, and was very disappointing in the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot last time out, when she failed to muster a significant effort before dropping through the field to finish seventh of nine.</p> <p>As a result, Sir Michael Stoute\u2019s improving three-year-old Abingdon currently heads the market for this afternoon\u2019s race at around 9-4, with Simple Verse available at 9-2. Abingdon is not guaranteed to improve for an extra quarter of a mile, however, and is priced as much on potential and her connections as her recent form, which includes a defeat at Listed level in July.</p> <p>Several of the other runners are attractively priced as a result, none more so than another Beckett-trained runner, <strong>Alyssa (3.05)</strong>. She is proven at the trip, having won over 14 furlongs at Salisbury last month in a good time, and could be a very live contender at around 12-1.</p> <p>Kilmah is the form horse in the May Hill Stakes after her recent win at Goodwood, but she had the run of the race there and <strong>Blending (2.30)</strong> may be able to improve past her today, while <strong>Spiritual Lady (3.40)</strong> stands out at the weights in the valuable event for graduates of last year\u2019s Leger yearling sales. <strong>Poets Word (4.15)</strong> will take all the beating later on the card, while <strong>Possible Future (2.40)</strong> and <strong>Pacolita (3.15)</strong> catch the eye at Epsom.</p> <h2>Tipping competition, day four<br></h2> <p>Our winners so far:</p> <p><strong>Monday:</strong> Green Zone 5-1, Purple Party 9-2, Fast Act 10-1</p> <p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Heir To A Throne 13-2, Noble Peace 8-1, Baysbrown 13-8</p> <p><strong>Wednesday: </strong>Priceless 4-1, Phosphorescence 7-1, Singeur 14-1</p> <p><strong>Standings after Day Three</strong></p> <p>Crasivo +19.50</p> <p>BearRides +17.50</p> <p>wiggy12 +17.50</p> <p>jakebuckfast +13.63</p> <p>lcprestes +12.13</p> <p>sandiuk +11.50</p> <p>Copshaw +11.50</p> <p>wemeanyounoharm +7.50</p> <p>titusisashambles +6</p> <p>GandT123 +6</p> <p>AshleyBrook +5</p> <p>yasmin11 +5</p> <p>GForce1 +4</p> <p>cerises +2</p> <p>LansonUproar +1.63</p> <p>FinsburyPark +1.50</p> <p>diegosigod +0</p> <p>melonk +0</p> <p>joehow +0</p> <p>ID3814422 +0</p> <p>orso -0.87</p> <p>slackdad38 -1</p> <p>Goldkid999 -1</p> <p>Rivercity -1.50</p> <p>Esherhammer -1.50</p> <p>MrWinnersSonInLaw -1.50</p> <p>ubikubik -3</p> <p>jamesstod -3</p> <p>72luca -3</p> <p>DrKelso -3.50</p> <p>Mulldog -3.50</p> <p>Harrytheactor -3.50</p> <p>moidadem -3.50</p> <p>elliot45 -3.50</p> <p>Ormrod76 -4</p> <p>chris1623 -4</p> <p>Toptrapper -4</p> <p>Bacciodilupo -4</p> <p>ps4999 -4</p> <p>TheVic -4</p> <p>PHILYERBOOTS -4</p> <p>23skidoo -6.37</p> <p>johne5knuckle -6.37</p> <p>William36 -6.37</p> <p>Perry Tang -6.37</p> <p>Fixxxer -6.37</p> <p>AndieAndson -6.37</p> <p>robertkeen -6.37</p> <p>GipsyHiller -9</p> <p>millreef -9</p> <p>Geoff Staddon -9</p> <p>Renzofan -9</p> <p>BatmanKaisers -9</p> <p>donlewis -9</p> <p>kingklynch -9</p> <p>Ellandback -9</p> <p>JahLion -9</p> <p>slowhandray -9</p> <p>gregcwb -9</p> <p>waltersobchak -9</p> <p>TL127 -9</p> <p>LexLondon -9</p> <p>ID0228872 -9</p> <p>kmill68 -9</p> <p>Blitzwing -9</p> <p>16heathermac01 -9</p> <p>maghazi -9</p> <p>Ben Leo -9</p> <p>Bonzodrongo -9</p> <p>spudpt -9</p> <p>goodfellow1 -9</p> <p>Bigboozer -9</p> <p>Lindsey6677 -9</p> <p>Sportingbest -9</p> <p>scarletdragon -9</p> <p>dean055 -9</p> <p>Cairo -9</p> <p>jessie69 -9</p> <p>Crasivo is our new leader, thanks to a most impressive double with Phosphorescence and Singeur.

A reorganisation of duties has meant we no longer have the time needed to keep scores while also obtaining and distributing prizes.</p> <p>We will still have competitions in the biggest weeks (Cheltenham, Aintree, Royal Ascot, Glorious Goodwood and maybe one or two others, as well as the Christmas quiz). And we\u2019ll still have a Talking Horses each day for tips, analysis and news, so we very much hope you\u2019ll join us to chew over whatever racing happens to be going on, especially those of you who have been in the habit of sharing winning tips at good prices.</p> <p>It\u2019s been almost eight years since DrKelso won our very first competition, which is not a bad length of time to sustain something like this.

  "<p>This past summer, I was guest-teaching in Europe. When the talk of the town wasn\u2019t Brexit, it was the US election. It was discussed the way you\u2019d discuss an alien invasion: bizarre. </p> <p>A look at US history, however, suggests that this election is far from unusual, and that Donald Trump\u2019s populist, anti-Washington cry to Make America Great Again emerges from the foundational belief of many early settlers: that they were the chosen ones who saw corruption and fought it, building a world cleansed of its sins.</p> <p>This ethos embodies what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/10/christianity-wrong-civil-religion-rousseau\">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a> called \u201ccivil religion\u201d \u2013 that is, the features that undergird political, social and economic behavior.

It\u2019s \u201cthe economy, stupid\u201d when it comes to describing problems. When it comes to solutions, beliefs count.</p> <p>The main issue facing voters can be summed up by the significant drop in upward mobility.

In it, we hear echoes of the preacher\u2019s \u201crid ye of the devil\u201d and traces of the political call to \u201cthrow the bastards out\u201d.</p> <p>This election year, it\u2019s clearest in the Trump campaign but emerges in alternative form in Democratic positions. Populist demands grow loud when the \u201cbastards\u201d are identified as Washington insiders, constrainers of liberties, corrupt and incompetent. Nativist demands increase when the \u201cbastards\u201d are immigrants or other suspect groups. In both, a troubled world will be set right when evil forces are purged.</p> <p>The country was born in a revolution against central government, but long before, early settlers, fleeing the centralization of Charles I, were wary of London: the king\u2019s men were the bastards to be thrown out in order to preserve local control. \u201cThe Congregational churches and self-contained towns of Massachusetts,\u201d the historian TH Breen writes, \u201cstood as visible evidence of the founders\u2019 decision to preserve in America what had been threatened in the mother country.\u201d </p> <p>The many early settlers who were religious dissenters were doubly suspicious of government, first for its centralizing efforts and second for the persecution it had foisted upon them. Internal migration through sparsely settled land contributed to the dismissal of central government and growing self-reliance, as there was relatively little government to rely on. Individual initiative and local community were the keys to survival. </p> <p>National government took a larger role as the country grew, yet the value of individual and local effort combined with a suspicion of central authorities were rooted in America\u2019s civil faith.</p> <p>Protestantism, born also in revolution (against Rome), added to the mix. The mandate to read the Bible for oneself and find one\u2019s own path to God encouraged the view that the responsible moral agent is the individual (with guidance from her local church). The Great Awakenings of the 1730s-1740s and 1820s-50s were festivals of individual iconoclasm, religious groups splintering off from established institutions, and populist religious ideas.</p> <p>Reformed Protestantism, which came to America through Puritan and other Calvinist traditions, had an even stronger impact on political development. It held that the sovereign nation does not start with central government but with the local covenanted community \u2013 the foedus \u2013 which form networks to constitute the nation. It\u2019s these ideas that gave the US its federal system of government and the continuing political and legal battles about states\u2019 rights. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea2a3a3074dac52ce16a7a60491cda9ebe457494\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea2a3a3074dac52ce16a7a60491cda9ebe457494/0_0_3500_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ammon Bundy greets occupier Duane Ehmer and his horse at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.

It was a faith well-suited to a self-reliant nation wary of authorities, and America embraced it. The number of Methodist churches rose from 20 in 1770 to 19,883 in 1860. By the mid-19th century, two Kentucky preachers could in good anti-authoritarian conscience opine: \u201cWe are not personally acquainted with the writings of John Calvin \u2026 neither do we care.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When Reagan said government was the problem, he was channeling American history and zeal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From this history came the myth, reality and creed of self-reliant localism and suspicion of central authority.

  "<p>OK, I\u2019ll come clean: I didn\u2019t know that much about the nomad Kazakh minority living in Mongolia before I saw this documentary. Their facial features are east Asian, their writing is Cyrillic and their language is peppered with the inshallahs of other Muslims. The snowy, rocky terrain of the Altai mountains is gorgeous and inviting, but also treacherous. Most fascinating is their working relationship with the magnificent golden eagles of the region. Captured at just the right moment of growth \u2013 old enough to fly, but still young enough to get yanked from a nest \u2013 they are trained to aid in foxhunting, but only for seven years, before they are returned to the wild. It is a noble tradition, but, as with traditions of many cultures, certain aspects of it can use a rethink.<br></p> <p>Enter Aisholpan, a rosy-cheeked, exuberant 13-year-old daughter of an eagle hunter with a natural propensity to follow in her father\u2019s footsteps.

The eagle-napping involves climbing down the side of a cliff, and it\u2019s here where it becomes evident that director Otto Bell isn\u2019t too worried about mixing in re-creations with his footage. But even if Aisholpan\u2019s training \u2013 which includes hoodwinking, responding to calls, dragging dead foxes and other hallmarks of falconry \u2013 is for the camera, it doesn\u2019t make it any less extraordinary. Especially in this remarkable environment, captured in breathtakingly crisp digital video.</p> <p>The movie needs a centerpiece, though, so Aisholpan ends up entering the community\u2019s annual Golden Eagle competition. Despite some raised eyebrows, she is allowed to compete: she\u2019s not only the first female, but the youngest entrant. Does she do well? Does her majestic eagle swoop down from the top of a mountain when she whistles, grabbing on to her protected forearm with cinematic gusto? I\u2019ll let you figure that one out.</p> <p>In addition to the feelgood, family-friendly aspects (along with Daisy Ridley, Star Wars\u2019 Rey, narrating), there are wonderful glimpses of this unique society\u2019s non-ornithological customs. Even the villains, those nasty jerks trying to keep a young girl from her dreams when she so clearly has a natural gift, are elegantly framed, with dazzling decor in their traditional dwellings. The Kazakh nomads may not have many material things, but what they do have doesn\u2019t want for style. </p> <p>The closing theme from Sia, with the refrain \u201cyou can do anything\u201d sung over and over, is perhaps a bit literal, but some aspects of the film are more nuanced. There\u2019s also just enough red in tooth and claw in the foxhunting moments to claim verisimilitude, but not so much that children will be vomiting into their popcorn.

As his colleague Omar Dominguez explains, \u201chappiness is kind of an out-there concept for some people\u201d.</p> <p>Montgomery and Dominguez work at <a href=\"http://thehappycitylab.com/\">Happy City</a>, a Canadian organisation named after Montgomery\u2019s 2013 book, which makes the case for retrofitting cities for happiness and argues that streets, parks, shopping centres, housing estates \u2013 indeed most urban infrastructure \u2013 can be designed to make people feel happier, behave better and be kinder.</p> <p>\u201cIf we give a damn about human wellbeing in cities, we need to study the emotional effects of spaces and systems,\u201d says Montgomery. \u201cWe need to use evidence to help fix the horrific mistakes we\u2019ve made over the last century.\u201d</p> <p>To beat the sceptics, the team at Happy City gathers evidence from psychology, neuroscience, public health and behavioural economics. They know that hospital patients who can see trees through their bedside windows <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nature-that-nurtures/\">heal faster than those who only see brick walls</a>. They know that commuters at rush hour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/nov/30/research.transport\">suffer more anxiety than fighter pilots or riot police</a> facing angry mobs. They even know that the friendliest front gardens are <a href=\"https://www.fastcoexist.com/3021478/how-urban-design-influences-how-many-friends-you-have\">precisely 10.6ft deep</a>.</p> <p>And they conduct their own research, particularly around Montgomery\u2019s theory that the most important ingredient for human happiness is social connection. <a href=\"http://thehappycitylab.com/project/the-happy-city-experiment/\">An experiment in Seattle</a> found that passersby are four times more likely to help lost tourists on lively streets filled with lots of small shops than on pristine, but essentially characterless, blocks, where people tend to move more quickly.</p> <p>\u201cWe think the kindness effect was a result of velocity,\u201d says Montgomery. \u201cPeople are nicer to each other when they move more slowly and have time to make eye contact.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/17/urban-planners-improve-mental-health-cities\">Building better mental health in cities from the ground up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the Project for Public Space conference in Vancouver from 12 to 15 September 2016, <a href=\"http://thehappycitylab.com/groundbreaking-public-experiment-on-happy-streets-coming-to-vancouver-for-placemaking-week/\">Happy City will host walking tours of the city</a>.

With one foot in research and another in urban planning, Happy City tries to bridge the gap between them. It is a consultancy, advising local governments, developers and any other organisations that have control over how cities grow, including the World Health Organisation.</p> <p>Montgomery says he\u2019s seen an \u201cexplosion of interest in the field\u201d of happiness and urban planning over the past three years \u2013 and not just from Scandinavian countries. \u201cI\u2019m especially thrilled to see that property developers are embracing the wellbeing agenda,\u201d he says.</p> <p><a href=\"http://thehappycitylab.com/project/wellbeing-principles-for-british-land/\">Happy City has helped British Land</a>, the UK\u2019s largest real estate investment trust, to weave wellbeing principles into its new development practices.<br></p> <p>\u201cBut we\u2019re seeing an awakening in other parts of the world, too,\u201d says Montgomery, referring to Ahura Builders, which invited Happy City to hack the designs for a community of 8,000 people in Punawale, India. \u201cOur happiness interventions included breaking up imposing superblocks, investing in quiet streets that are safe and friendly for pedestrians and creating a village heart to which residents could walk and shop.\u201d<br></p> <p>Another project was based in Mexico City. Chaotic, crowded and with high levels of crime, it\u2019s an unusual setting for the happiness agenda. But in the autumn of 2014 the local government\u2019s innovation unit commissioned Happy City to do a three-day <a href=\"http://thehappycitylab.com/project/happy-neighbourhood-audit/\">\u201chappiness audit\u201d of Colonia Doctores</a>, a poor neighbourhood in the south-west of the city.<br></p> <p>Dominguez, Happy City\u2019s director of operations and sustainability, gathered together public officials, city planners, architects and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 local residents. On the first day they discussed key principles that influence wellbeing, such as access to nature and the ability to have positive social interactions on a daily basis.<br></p> <p>\u201cOne of the key concerns in Mexico is safety. What people do when they\u2019re concerned about their safety is to fortify,\u201d says Dominguez. \u201cActually, one of the best things you can do is generate a sense of trust and calm.\u201d<br></p> <p>On the second day the group toured Colonia Doctores, applying the principles to physical aspects of the neighbourhood and on the third they presented their findings. Recommendations included opening a new museum and pedestrianising an area outside the local wrestling arena, turning it into a cultural corridor around Mexican wrestling. \u201cThat sense of community is good for their wellbeing,\u201d says Dominguez. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/jun/08/city-living-bad-for-health\">Is city living bad for your health?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018Happiness is good for the bottom line\u2019</h2> <p>One thing the Happy City team is really passionate about is making the business case for happiness. \u201cBuilding healthier, happier places is not more expensive.

  "<p>There is a great mystery at the heart of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/14/man-who-fell-to-earth-review\">The Man Who Fell to Earth</a>, Nicolas Roeg\u2019s cult film: its soundtrack. There is a persistent rumour that long-lost music for the film \u2013 recorded by its star David Bowie \u2013 sits somewhere in a vault. There\u2019s only one problem: Bowie\u2019s soundtrack to The Man Who Fell to Earth doesn\u2019t actually exist. The music that appears in the film \u2013 released for the first time next month as part of a collector\u2019s edition by Studio Canal and a vinyl box set by Universal \u2013 was written and produced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/mar/20/guardianobituaries\">John Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas</a>.</p> <p>The never-before-told story of its creation is almost as improbable as Roeg\u2019s film. Signed to both star in and compose an original soundtrack for the film, Bowie, then at the peak of his early fame, intended to record the music once shooting had completed, envisioning it as the follow-up to his album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/22/david-bowie-unreleased-album-box-set-who-can-i-be-now-the-gouster\">Young Americans</a>. But he began working instead on Station to Station, while deep into his cocaine and milk phase. After three months, he had managed to complete only five or six tracks in a bizarre mishmash of styles \u2013 from country rock to instrumentals on African thumb pianos and atonal electronic music. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jun/25/how-we-made-man-fell\">How we made: Paul Mayersberg and Tony Richmond on The Man Who Fell to Earth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The British arranger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/30/arranging-brian-wilson-paul-buckmaster\">Paul Buckmaster</a> worked on the demos with Bowie at his rented house in Bel Air, and at Cherokee Studios in Hollywood.

If John Phillips had not had a fight with him, I\u2019d say, \u2018Oh really?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The next time the pair met, Phillips was living in Malibu. \u201cWe went to Candy Clark\u2019s house,\u201d he said in an interview before his death in 2001. \u201cNic was going with her at the time.\u201d Roeg showed him a cut of the film on a small portable TV. \u201cI just loved the movie the moment I saw it.\u201d He was unsure why Roeg was asking him to work on the soundtrack when Bowie was the obvious choice, but took the job anyway, aiming to create a \u201creal American score with banjos and folk and rock\u201d. </p> <p>Phillips \u2013 whose career started in the late 1950s in a doo-wop/jazz vocal group called the Smoothies, before he founded, first, folk trio the Journeymen, then the Mamas and the Papas \u2013 was steeped in American roots music.

That person was Mick Taylor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/30/in-praise-of-mick-taylor\">erstwhile guitarist for the Rolling Stones</a>, who he considered \u201cthe best guitar player in the world\u201d. </p> <p>They started work at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/gallery/2015/oct/02/surreal-estate-art-house-in-chelsea-in-pictures\">Glebe Place</a>, Phillips\u2019 rented house in Chelsea. One day, Phillips recalled, \u201cKeith Richards walked in and there\u2019s Mick Taylor sitting there. We\u2019re playing guitar together.\u201d On seeing Taylor, Richards let out a scream. \u201cThey both froze.\u201d They hadn\u2019t seen each other since Taylor had walked out on the Stones just over a year earlier. \u201cIt was a little testy,\u201d Phillips said. </p> <p>Richards and Taylor behaved \u201clike dogs circling\u201d. Keith broke the ice the only way he knew how: he grabbed a guitar and joined in. \u201cWe just played old country songs,\u201d Phillips said. Those would become the basis for the music Phillips recorded for the film, which included originals like <a href=\"https://play.spotify.com/track/5x2SQ10qxuVvFWqEtkuIGX?play=true&amp;utm_source=open.spotify.com&amp;utm_medium=open\">Boys from the South</a>, as well as spirited covers of Hank Snow\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrlgmi3XsXc\">Rhumba Boogie</a> and Bill Monroe and his Bluegrass Boys\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5bGe4fpLHs\">Bluegrass Breakdown</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"914d652276425952489d45fea3b27938b552eff2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/914d652276425952489d45fea3b27938b552eff2/43_133_2177_2721/800.jpg\" alt=\"Bianca Jagger.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rude awakening \u2026 Bianca Jagger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ANL/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSome of the music was very improvised,\u201d says Richard Goldblatt, one of the engineers who worked with Phillips. \u201cThe recordings were quite innovative.\u201d Despite being under immense pressure to produce the music in a matter of weeks, Phillips continued to lead a busy and complicated life of narcotic and sexual excess. After one session, he arrived back home around two in the morning. Finding nobody there, he walked round to his friend Mick Jagger\u2019s house on Cheyne Walk, looking for his wife. Instead, he found Bianca Jagger and Liza Minnelli\u2019s younger sister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/02/judy-garland-daughter-lorna-luft-legends-child\">Lorna Luft</a>. Genevieve wasn\u2019t there and nor was Mick. \u201cWe all sat around, drank wine and got pissed,\u201d said Phillips. \u201cI was playing the guitar, singing some songs and stuff.\u201d Eventually, Luft left and John and Bianca \u2013 who had enjoyed a brief affair in 1970, before she met and married Jagger \u2013 ended up in bed. </p> <p>At some point close to dawn, they both fell asleep. At the session the following morning, Phillips was a no-show. The musicians and engineers all sat waiting. Someone rang Glebe Place to find out where he was. Waite took the call. She went round to Cheyne Walk, figuring he might be there, talked the help into letting her in and was told he was in the bedroom \u2013 with Bianca. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Genevieve storms in and takes a swing at Bianca</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cSo we were awakened around 10.30am,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThere was Genevieve, \u2018I know you\u2019re in there, you two.\u2019 Oh God, here I am in Mick\u2019s bed with Mick\u2019s old lady. My old lady\u2019s outside, banging on the door. There were Nicaraguan maids running around, screaming in Nicaraguan. Genevieve storms in the door and takes a swing at Bianca. I sort of hold Genevieve back and take her out. She just ran down the street. I had to go to work.\u201d </p> <p>The final session for the score took place in February, with the film\u2019s world premiere at Leicester Square in London now just three weeks away. Phillips began to mix the tracks so they could be laid into the edit. At that point, says Goldblatt, \u201csuddenly, he started to go a little peculiar\u201d. He could hear clicks and noises on the tape and, despite the engineer\u2019s insistence that there was nothing there, insisted they do everything over. But the problem persisted. By the fourth or fifth day, things were pretty tense between them. Then something snapped. \u201cHe lost it for some reason,\u201d says Goldblatt, who walked out of the session and returned the next morning to find he\u2019d been replaced by another engineer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-man-who-thrilled-the-world-appreciation\">David Bowie: the man who thrilled the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Goldblatt was later told that \u201cthe projectionist had gone into the toilets and all he could hear was somebody in the cubicle next to him sniffing \u2013 big sniffs\u201d. The bathroom breaks Phillips had been taking, almost at the end of every take, suddenly made sense. \u201cHe was doing unbelievable amounts of coke.\u201d So much, Goldblatt believes, that he was having auditory hallucinations. Rafe McKenna, assistant engineer, recalls Roeg coming to the studio to have a \u201cserious discussion with Phillips about his behaviour. Told him off, basically, and said stop pissing off the engineers and get it finished tonight.\u201d</p> <p>The eleventh hour entreaty worked. \u201cThe music just came flying out of the studio and I stuck it in,\u201d says editor Graeme Clifford. Roeg declares himself happy with the music Phillips produced for the film. \u201cIt had a range of different qualities that I thought was rather interesting,\u201d he says. \u201cHe really was an individual composer.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 The restored The Man Who Fell to Earth is in UK cinemas on 9 September, when the soundtrack will also be available, and then on DVD and Blu-ray on 24 October.</p>",

It\u2019s the record Waterman calls his \u201cget-out-of-jail card \u2026 Whenever I lost the floor as a DJ, I just stuck Dancing Queen on.\u201d It\u2019s a track even the Queen is supposedly fond of boogying to (Chris Evans claimed that she told him: \u201cI always try to dance when this song comes on because I am the Queen and I like to dance\u201d).</p> <p>If you\u2019re left in any doubt over Dancing Queen\u2019s charms, then just consider the 1996 Sex Pistols reunion show in Finsbury park, north London. To remind the audience just how stale the music scene had grown before Johnny Rotten et al came along, the PA blasted out the likes of the Bay City Rollers and other cheesy 70s pop staples. Unfortunately, that playlist also included Abba\u2019s Dancing Queen \u2013 when it came on, the old punks gathered together failed to sneer: i<a href=\"http://www.philjens.plus.com/pistols/pistols/pistols_classicgigs.html\">nstead they began singing in unison</a>. As Craymer says: \u201cThat\u2019s what people do with Dancing Queen \u2013 they just surrender.\u201d</p>",

He <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/donald-trump-lies-that-he-opposed-iraq-war-from-beginning-an?utm_term=.wt2E7Y2rwP\">lied about opposing the Iraq war</a>, criticized Obama\u2019s 2011 withdrawal and repeated his advocacy of stealing Iraq\u2019s oil \u2013 a measure he evidently believes would require a minimal force presence, despite the certainty that the well-armed locals might have a problem with their principal source of wealth being plundered by a foreign power.</p> <p>Speaking before an audience of veterans, Trump unexpectedly attacked the current generation of generals and flag officers. While previously Trump had said he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/the-remarkably-unappealling-anger-of-donald-trump/\">knew better than the generals</a> about fighting Islamic State, this time he intimated that he\u2019d get \u201cdifferent generals\u201d \u2013 a habit more typical of caudillos than American presidents.</p> <p>He followed up by saying his ultimate plan to defeat Isis would be some parts of his still-unspecified plan, and some parts of his unspecified generals\u2019 unspecified plan. He waved away his lack of specifics for a war in which 5,000 US troops are currently serving as not wishing to \u201cbroadcast\u201d his plans to the enemy.</p> <p>He interrupted a veteran\u2019s question about veterans\u2019 suicide rates after she gave the correct number, <a href=\"http://www.militarytimes.com/story/veterans/2016/07/07/va-suicide-20-daily-research/86788332/\">20 per day</a>, so he could give an incorrect one, 22. Trump fumbled through a question about redressing sexual assault against female service members \u2013 something he once tweeted was the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/331907383771148288\">inevitable result of mixed service</a>, a point he defended on Wednesday \u2013 by arguing the military needed to set up internal courts, as if the military does not already have its own well-established justice system.<br></p> <p>Trump\u2019s reversion to his typical ignorance and certitude obscured a poor showing from his opponent. Hillary Clinton spent her preceding half-hour grilling defending herself on her lax handling of classified information, a situation that a former Navy lieutenant in the audience correctly observed would spell doom for a low-ranking service member.</p> <p>She acknowledged her vote for the Iraq war was a \u201cmistake\u201d and gestured in the direction of the same for her advocacy of the 2011 Libya war, but waved it away by pointing out Trump\u2019s support for the same disastrous interventions, a baffling decision for a candidate whose central pitch is that Trump is uniquely unqualified to be president.</p> <p>To reassure a progressive veteran in the audience Clinton offered that she would treat the use of force as a \u201clast resort\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again,\u201d Clinton said, as if there were not this minute thousands of them there.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d0d178e4b042bbfb3246c8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T02:53:24.444Z\">3.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Colin Powell's advice to Clinton on using personal email</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Although it didn\u2019t directly come up in the forum on Wednesday evening, this is intriguing reading: a 2009 email exchange between Hillary Clinton and former secretary of state Colin Powell in which she asks for \u2013 and he gives \u2013 advice on using her Blackberry in the state department.</p> <p>The full exchange is <a href=\"https://medium.com/oversightdems/cummings-releases-full-powell-email-advising-clinton-on-personal-email-use-65904c1ccfa#.lo7sv941t\">here</a>, released by Deomcratic Rep. Elijah Cummings via the House oversight committee, but here\u2019s a snippet of Powell\u2019s email:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I didn\u2019t have a BlackBerry. What I did do was have a personal computer that was hooked up to a private phone line (sounds ancient.) So I could communicate with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the State Department servers. I even used it to do business with some foreign leaders and some of the senior folks in the Department on their personal email accounts. I did the same thing on the road in hotels.</p> <p>Now, the real issue had to do with PDAs, as we called them a few years ago before BlackBerry became a noun. And the issue was DS would not allow them into the secure spaces, especially up your way. When I asked why not they gave me all kinds of nonsense about how they gave out signals and could be read by spies, etc. Same reason they tried to keep mobile phones out of the suite. I had numerous meetings with them. We even opened one up for them to try to explain to me why it was more dangerous than say, a remote control for one of the many tvs in the suite. Or something embedded in my shoe heel. They never satisfied me and NSA/CIA wouldn\u2019t back off. So, we just went about our business and stopped asking. I had an ancient version of a PDA and used it. In general, the suite was so sealed that it is hard to get signals in or out wirelessly.</p> <p>However, there is a real danger. If it is public that you have a BlackBerry and it it government and you are using it, government or not, to do business, it may become an official record and subject to the law. Reading about the President\u2019s BB rules this morning, it sounds like it won\u2019t be as useful as it used to be. Be very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d0ceace4b042bbfb3246be\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T02:42:22.336Z\">3.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For those now wondering when we can watch the two candidates go head to head \u2013 on the same stage, at the same time, presumably answering something like the same questions \u2013 here\u2019s the schedule:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Monday 26 September, </strong>Hofstra University, Hempstead, NY.

Liberals would find much to dispute, but a dispute could proceed on the merits of Romney\u2019s national security perspective weighed against Obama\u2019s. </p> <p>No one could ever accuse Donald Trump of being Mitt Romney. </p> <p>Before boarding the aircraft carrier turned museum USS Intrepid, Trump gave a speech on Wednesday gesturing in the direction of Republican national security orthodoxies. The army\u2019s active-duty force levels, known as \u201cend strength\u201d, ought to return to 540,000 soldiers, where they were earlier in the decade, reversing a trajectory heading <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.armytimes.com/story/military/careers/army/2016/05/07/army-shrinks-smallest-level-since-before-world-war-ii/83875962/\">down to 450,000 by 2018</a>. The navy ought to have a fleet sized at 350 ships, beyond its <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://news.usni.org/2016/07/12/20627\">current planning for a 308-ship fleet</a> after 2020. </p> <p>Along with an expansion of combat aircraft and missile defenses, and repealing a budget cap on defense spending known as the sequester, Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for purchasing more military hardware would not sound out of place coming from a typical Republican on the congressional armed services committees. Superficially at least Romney might not have disagreed, either. That was likely the point: to reassure voters Trump possesses a baseline level of familiarity with the basics of military responsibility. </p> <p>By the evening, however, at NBC News\u2019 touted \u201cCommander-in-Chief Forum\u201d, Trump ordered off his familiar campaign menu of word salads. He <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/donald-trump-lies-that-he-opposed-iraq-war-from-beginning-an?utm_term=.wt2E7Y2rwP\">lied about opposing the Iraq war</a>, criticized Obama\u2019s 2011 withdrawal and repeated his now-boilerplate advocacy of stealing Iraq\u2019s oil \u2013 a measure that he evidently believes would require a minimal force presence, despite the certainty that the well-armed locals might have a problem with their principal source of wealth being plundered by a foreign power. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"703937ccd93adfb357da71693e0a38a4f045cc80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/703937ccd93adfb357da71693e0a38a4f045cc80/0_0_4257_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump waits to be introduced at the Commander in Chief Forum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump waits to be introduced at the forum on Wednesday night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking before an audience of veterans, Trump unexpectedly attacked the current generation of generals and flag officers. The current senior officer corps has been \u201creduced to rubble\u201d, Trump said, and were \u201cembarrassing for our country\u201d. While previously Trump had said he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/the-remarkably-unappealling-anger-of-donald-trump/\">knew better than the generals</a> about fighting Islamic State, this time he intimated that he\u2019d get \u201cdifferent generals\u201d \u2013 a habit more typical of caudillos than American presidents.</p> <p>He followed up by saying his ultimate plan to defeat Isis would consist of some parts of his still-unspecified plan and some parts of his unspecified generals\u2019 unspecified plan. He waved away his lack of specifics on a war in which 5,000 US troops are currently serving as not wishing to \u201cbroadcast\u201d his plans to the enemy. </p> <p>Trump again lavished praise on Vladimir Putin, pledging a new era of US-Russian cooperation \u2013 something both Obama and George Bush attempted and failed to achieve after US and Russian interests diverged. Despite months of the Russian military\u2019s demonstrating in Syria that Putin\u2019s objective is to suppress Bashar al-Assad\u2019s domestic resistance, Trump claimed that Russia wished to defeat Isis \u201cas badly as we do\u201d. Putin might be a dictator \u2013 Trump waved away moderator Matt Lauer on this point \u2013 but he had \u201cvery strong control\u201d, he said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/donald-trump-putin-more-of-a-leader-of-his-country-than-obama-for-us-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/525fa\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2700631\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump: Putin is far more of a leader of his country than Obama is for US \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"NBC News\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d10cdae4b0c1d95ae14821\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/donald-trump-putin-more-of-a-leader-of-his-country-than-obama-for-us-video\">\u2018Putin is more of a leader of his country than Obama is for US\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Nor did Trump demonstrate greater mastery of urgent issues of US service members\u2019 health and safety. He interrupted a veteran\u2019s question about veterans\u2019 suicide rates after she gave the correct number, <a href=\"http://www.militarytimes.com/story/veterans/2016/07/07/va-suicide-20-daily-research/86788332/\">20 per day</a>, so he could give an incorrect one, 22. Trump fumbled through a question about redressing sexual assault against women service personnel \u2013 something he once tweeted was the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/331907383771148288\">inevitable result of mixed-gender service</a>, a point he defended on Wednesday. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s reversion to his typical ignorance and certitude obscured a poor showing from his opponent, the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. Clinton spent her preceding half-hour grilling on the Intrepid defending herself on her lax handling of classified information, a situation that a former navy lieutenant in the audience correctly observed would spell doom for a low-ranking service member. She acknowledged her vote for the Iraq war was a \u201cmistake\u201d and gestured in the direction of the same for her advocacy of the 2011 Libya war, but waved this away by pointing out Trump\u2019s support for the same disastrous interventions \u2013 a baffling decision for a candidate whose central pitch is that Trump is uniquely unqualified to be president. </p> <p>To reassure a progressive veteran in the audience, Clinton offered that she would treat the use of force as a \u201clast resort\u201d. Every presidential aspirant issues that boilerplate \u2013 as it elides an explanation of what the candidate thinks is worth fighting for \u2013 but Clinton\u2019s long public record, which she uses as a selling point against Trump, gives reason to doubt it. \u201cWe are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again,\u201d Clinton said, as if there were not thousands of them already there.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s gestures in hawkish directions are at least predictable. Trump is something wilder, less disciplined and far less grounded. Asked about his fitness for diplomacy, Trump boasted of his disastrous meeting in Mexico last week with Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, in which the Mexican president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">publicly contradicted Trump\u2019s claim</a> that the two did not discuss payment for Trump\u2019s proposed border wall, and which left Pe\u00f1a Nieto <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/enrique-pena-nieto-donald-trump-public-relations-disaster\">diminished at home</a>.</p> <p>For all the derision Romney endured in his presidential bid, at least he never engineered a lose-lose diplomatic summit.</p>",

McGregor spoke for 15 minutes about each object he\u2019d selected from the museum \u2013 but the listeners wanted to see them. The British Museum followed it up with an exhibition, which has since toured and spawned a bestselling book. Earlier this year it visited the Western Australian Museum, and this week it opens in Canberra.</p> <p>Around 50% of the objects in the original collection are too fragile to travel to Australia, including the Sutton Hoo Helmet \u2013 an Anglo-Saxon helmet from a Viking long ship burial \u2013 and a double-headed mosaic serpent from Mexico. But senior curator Michael Pickering says they have been replaced with \u201ccompanion pieces\u201d that \u201ctell the same stories and are often from the same archeological site. So instead of the helmet, they are travelling Viking silver. It\u2019s very valuable and fascinating. It talks to the dark ages and trade.\u201d</p> <p>Each object is more than the sum of its parts, Pickering says. \u201cThey are objects in time but they are also symbolic of human thought and activity. What\u2019s amazing is the story they tell.\u201d</p> <p>In Canberra ahead of the opening, Pickering takes Guardian Australia through the exhibition\u2019s catalogue. On one page there\u2019s what looks like a pretty ordinary rock. \u201cIt\u2019s a chopping tool,\u201d Pickering explains. \u201cIt\u2019s the oldest object in the exhibition \u2013 two million years old. It\u2019s a piece of rock that can break up bone. This is when humans become human \u2013 it requires thought. It\u2019s the beginning of human thought.\u201d</p> <p>We flick to an image of a hand axe. \u201cIt\u2019s around 800,000 years old, and to use it requires technical skills and dexterity.\u201d</p> <p>We move to a picture of an Egyptian cosmetic palette, used for kohl. Humankind has discovered makeup. This too is significant. \u201cPeople are starting to have items that are lovely to look at, not just because of their religious or utilitarian values,\u201d says Pickering.</p> <p>Indigenous Australia is represented with a basket from Arnhem Land \u2013 a \u201crepresentation of a continuing culture\u201d says Pickering, as the baskets are still in use today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3cc89b95d45aef81e7e3d81ccdeb3f7f10390be9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cc89b95d45aef81e7e3d81ccdeb3f7f10390be9/0_460_3080_3136/982.jpg\" alt=\"Head of Augustus, Bronze, glass, calcite, 27\u201325BC, Mero\u00eb, Sudan.\" width=\"982\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Head of Augustus, Bronze, glass, calcite, 27\u201325BC, Mero\u00eb, Sudan.

One of the most important surviving portraits of Rome\u2019s first emperor, it was originally part of a statue that was beheaded, and was a considered a major find when excavated in Sudan in 1910. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than life-size and it\u2019s very powerful. Look at its strength of character \u2013 it\u2019s much more than a sculpted head,\u201d says Pickering.</p> <p> Trinca says it\u2019s one of his favourites too. \u201cI love the bronze head of Augustus. It\u2019s a gorgeous piece and it\u2019s a rare artefact to have in bronze from this time. I love the story of it \u2013 how it speaks of the extension of imperial power, but was also taken as loot. The head was lopped off the statue. It was found many years later and what it talks of is the fragility of power.\u201d</p> <p>All the objects are displayed with a minimum of set dressing, Trinca says. \u201cThe objects are the focus and they\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Pickering agrees \u2013 the beauty is what drew him to this project. \u201cThese objects are so damn beautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom an aesthetic sense they stimulate the imagination. They make me think about how they were made. They make us think about why we should bother.\u201d</p> <p>Conversely, the objects from our time look utilitarian to us \u2013 but they tell a bigger story.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/sep/08/ritual-sacrifice-ancient-insults-and-sacred-fire-2-million-years-of-history-in-pictures\">Ritual sacrifice, ancient insults and sacred fire: 2 million years of history \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Object 99 is a counterfeit Chelsea football shirt from Indonesia.

Forehand volley winner by Williams and she will have a seventh chance for a service break, but it\u2019s over quickly as Williams dumps a backhand into the net. Deuce again. Halep hits a winner into the open court and she will have a game point (again!). This time she finally holds to end a game that spans 18 points and nearly 10 minutes. A nice fightback from love-40 down from Halep.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d0ab0ae4b0b2ee833761c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T00:04:43.541Z\">1.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Second set: Williams 6-2, 1-0 Halep* (*denotes next server)</strong></p> <p>Williams follows an unforced error with a forehand winner.

And there\u2019s no denying that each and every one of them bestrode, or bestrides, their sport in a way most of their competitors have never come close to.</p> <p>Of course, there\u2019s something else they all share: gender. Traditionally, when we talk of sporting achievement at this level, no female athlete receives a mention \u2013 until, that is, earlier this week. In an advertising campaign timed to coincide with the US Open tennis championships, the sportswear giant Nike threw a new name into the argument: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams\">Serena Williams</a>.</p> <p>The first reaction of most people when you concede publicly that Nike may have a point is one of derision and dismissal. \u201cSerena, in the same class as Pel\u00e9? You\u2019re mad!\u201d But then, as they listen to the case for the American\u2019s inclusion in such elite company, they begin to realise that it\u2019s not such a preposterous notion after all.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T22:45:49.736Z\">at 11.45pm BST</time></p>  </div>"
