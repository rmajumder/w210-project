  "<p>The misery and despair set out in the Nauru files, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive\">published by the Guardian</a>, provides an unprecedented view of life in the Australian-run detention centre. We can identify the trends in incident reports over time and how they have rapidly risen on occasion. We can see how types of incidents \u2013 sexual assaults, self-harming, abuse \u2013 have changed over time.<br></p> <p>But what was the worst day on Nauru? One day \u2013 29 September 2014 \u2013 must be a candidate. Certainly it was among the most incident-packed. This was just three days before the then immigration minister, Scott Morrison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/03/nauru-child-sex-abuse-allegations-new-inquiry\">announced a sweeping review into conditions and allegations of assault</a> at the detention centre. Several of the reports show the desperation of many of the asylum seekers, with several threatening self-harm. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2016/aug/10/datablog-analysis-of-nauru-files-highlights-heavy-toll-on-children\">Datablog: analysis of Nauru files highlights heavy toll on children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The incident logs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2016/aug/10/datablog-analysis-of-nauru-files-highlights-heavy-toll-on-children\">show an average of 2.3 reports a day</a>.

  "<p>Gurbaksh Chahal, a Silicon Valley technology mogul who pleaded guilty to assault after police say he punched and kicked his girlfriend 117 times, was sentenced to one year in jail on Friday for violating probation.<br></p> <p>Judge Tracie Brown revoked Chahal\u2019s probation and ordered him to spend 12 months in jail for allegedly assaulting a second woman months after pleading guilty in the first domestic violence case. Chahal\u2019s lawyer, however, said he would appeal the ruling, and the defendant was released on bail.<br></p> <p>When he arrived, Chahal rushed past a crowd of reporters outside the packed San Francisco courtroom without commenting.

At the end of a long conveyor belt, two men and a boy piled up the roti for bagging and transporting to enormous meal tents.<br></p> <p>The roti operation overseen by Abed was just one element of the huge logistical challenge of organising <a href=\"http://jalsauk.org/\">the 50th Jalsa Salana</a>, a 40,000-strong international gathering of Ahmadiyya Muslims taking place this weekend at Oakland farm, near Alton. </p> <p>For the UK\u2019s Ahmadis, this affirmation is particularly apt after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/tanveer-ahmed-jailed-for-murder-glasgow-shopkeeper-in-sectarian-attack\">the jailing this week of Tanveer Ahmed</a> for the murder of Glasgow newsagent Asad Shah in a sectarian attack motivated by hatred of Shah\u2019s Ahmadi faith. </p> <p>The Jalsa, which opened on Friday lunchtime and runs until Sunday, is an opportunity for \u201cspiritual uplift\u201d among members of the Ahmadi community and others, according to Abdul Quddus Arif, a 26-year-old imam. \u201cWe stand together and pray together as an international community across cultures and boundaries. It\u2019s an amazing and beautiful thing,\u201d he said shortly before Friday prayers, marking the opening of the Jalsa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1765696e37fcb880c6d209c76740bd14000d8af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1765696e37fcb880c6d209c76740bd14000d8af/0_18_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An attendee of the UK\u2019s largest Muslim convention, Jalsa Salana, rides a bicycle through a field of tents\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ahmadis fear \u2018religious and cultural bigotry\u2019 against them could be imported to the UK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shah\u2019s killing has laid bare the extent of hostility and prejudice shown towards the Ahmadi community by many other Muslims. \u201cPeople have certainly been talking about it,\u201d said Adam Walker, an Ahmadi spokesman at the Jalsa. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say [the murder] has created anxiety or a sense of fear, because if you\u2019re known as an Ahmadi you already face problems in every facet of your life. But the key question for many of us is, where does it lead?\u201d</p> <p>The risk was that \u201creligious and cultural bigotry\u201d in South Asia \u2013 and Pakistan in particular \u2013 could be imported to the UK, Walker added.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Ahmadiyya moved their global headquarters to the UK in the 1980s after Pakistan essentially outlawed their faith. But in the past few years, there have been signs of increasing animosity from other Muslims in Britain, with boycott movements, harassment and ostracism reported on university campuses.</p> <p>Many orthodox Muslims regard the Ahmadiyya as blasphemous for not adhering to the belief that Muhammad was the final prophet. In the UK, the Ahmadis are a minority within a minority: there are about 30,000 among a Muslim population of 2.7m, itself only about 5% of the general population.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5ca38d5fd3c3109342df4da7e54fb0c11eb7594\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5ca38d5fd3c3109342df4da7e54fb0c11eb7594/0_196_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Attendees outside an ice-cream van at the UK\u2019s largest Muslim convention, Jalsa Salana\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We stand together and pray together as an international community across cultures and boundaries.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Hampshire, Mohammed Nasser Khan, the man in overall charge of operations, was considering the scale of his logistical task. Around 5,000 volunteers were organised into teams covering food, security, transport and parking, accommodation, first aid, translation and exhibitions.</p> <p>Although the community has owned the 200-acre Oakland farm since 2008, its annual licence to convert the site from working farm (sheep, cattle and crops) to convention centre covers just 28 days. Khan and his teams have to build a mini-city from scratch in the two to three weeks leading up to the gathering, and dismantle it without trace in the week afterwards. \u201cAs well as all the volunteers, there are 500 contractors on site, who need to be fed,\u201d he said while directing supplies into his vast kitchens.</p> <p>Elsewhere, broadcasting units were preparing to transmit Friday\u2019s lunchtime prayers \u2013 led by the Ahmadi caliph, Mirza Masroor Ahmad, and translated into a dozen languages \u2013 to some 80 million people worldwide.<br></p> <p>In the \u201cladies section\u201d, with strict segregation in force, baby-changing tents and pushchair areas were filling up. \u201cThe reason behind the separation of men and women is religious, but we also find we are much more comfortable this way,\u201d said Fariha Khan, a south London GP who was head of women\u2019s security for the Jalsa.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/09/shunned-for-saying-theyre-muslims-life-for-ahmadis-after-asad-shahs\">Shunned for saying they're Muslims: life for Ahmadis after Asad Shah's murder</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She and other women scoffed at the idea that there might be more on offer in the men\u2019s section of the site. \u201cIt\u2019s a mirror image.

I know Islamophobia is on the rise, but it\u2019s really important to highlight the positives,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Among the weekend\u2019s activities of prayers, speeches and socialising was the ceremonial raising of the union jack and an ambitious project to get participants \u2013 men and women \u2013 to write verses of the Qur\u2019an in calligraphy.</p> <p>A climate-controlled marquee housed a collection of ancient and beautiful Qur\u2019ans, calligraphy tools and ink pots.

I am a zealot when it comes to feminism, and a militant too, which is handy as that\u2019s the only way people like Davies describe feminists \u2013 as if we can be classified as either really caring about it, or not so much.</p> <p>I really care about being a feminist. I really care about women in this country being able both to take up new opportunities that arise as women\u2019s equality advances, and to continue the battle against the range of injustices that still impede us in every walk of life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/18/justice-for-men-and-boys-feminists-backlash\">Justice for Men and Boys\u2019 hatred of feminism eclipses its remit to help men | Catherine Bennett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In my case this equates less to having my cake and eating it and more to sourcing the ingredients, making it myself and then going out across the country offering it to thousands of new members. Because right now no other political party is feeding the hunger of many voters for the most basic thing: gender equality.</p> <p>The wonderful thing about Davies\u2019 awful comments is that they shed light on what is happening right across British politics \u2013 from the tiny dark cave at the back of the Conservative party where Davies lives in the shadow of a female leader who, when she took over from a man, reduced the number of women in cabinet; to the lads of the Labour party currently winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/11/labour-mayoral-candidates-men-feminism-corbyn\" title=\"\">every candidacy opportunity from mayors to leadership contenders</a>; to the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-politics/11825171/Eight-white-men-in-a-room-Life-inside-the-bleak-Liberal-Democrats.html\" title=\"\">all-male, all-white Liberal Democrats</a> whose fightback doesn\u2019t yet include fighting for women\u2019s equal rights. None of these parties seem to think equality for women is in any way a priority.</p> <p>It\u2019s true that Davies\u2019 outburst, at a conference organised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/18/justice-for-men-and-boys-feminists-backlash\" title=\"\">Justice for Men &amp; Boys</a>, is egregious. He asserted that the UK justice system shows \u201cclear discrimination against men\u201d \u2013 a claim so staggering that it raises serious questions about his fitness to serve on the Commons justice committee.</p> <p>The facts are this: the UK\u2019s prison population is largely made up of men. Women are significantly less likely to commit the kind of violent offences that attract custodial sentences. In the UK women are more likely than men to be imprisoned for non-violent offences, more likely to be sent to prison for their first offence, and much more likely to be both victims of crime as well as offenders. Black and minority-ethnic women are also disproportionately more likely to be imprisoned.</p> <p>Women in prison are very often survivors of serious crime and sustained abuse. Prosecution rates for sexual violence against women and girls are depressingly low. Over half of female prisoners in the UK report having <a href=\"http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/ProjectsResearch/Women\" title=\"\">experienced emotional, physical or sexual abuse as a child</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Informing me that I have again been named Lying Feminist of the Month prompts another order of doughnuts in our office</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Davies\u2019 apparent denial that violence against women and girls is a problem in the UK demonstrates further how astoundingly ill-informed this justice committee member is.</p> <p>Davies is right when he says that access to justice is a gendered problem \u2013 but accidentally. The odds are actually stacked against women. Cuts to legal aid leave women, far more likely than men to be in low-paying jobs, with no recourse to affordable justice. Migrant women in particular face dual discrimination in a justice system that insists on a husband with immigration status as the only way to access public funds.</p> <p>I don\u2019t expect much of this to hold sway with Davies, or indeed with the Justice for Men &amp; Boys party, who regularly send waspish updates to inform me that I have again been named their \u201cLying Feminist of the Month\u201d. (This usually prompts an eye roll, and another order of doughnuts in our office.)</p> <p>But I do hope and expect it to be taken on board by the other parties. Is our democracy so broken that these kinds of assertions can be made by someone who is supposed to be upholding it?

It\u2019s time for Theresa May to show there\u2019s more to her feminism than a T-shirt. It\u2019s time for Tim Farron to #fightbackforwomen.</p> <p>The Women\u2019s Equality party (WE) has policies to bring down the barriers to women seeking justice in the UK. They include unconscious bias training for all police, magistrates, judges and jurors to address ingrained attitudes towards women who are victims of sexually violent crimes. They include plans for the restoration of legal aid for all cases involving domestic violence, and for the provision of specialist counselling and support for abused partners. They include <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/22/womens-equality-party-theresa-may-goals-first-100-days-prime-minister\" title=\"\">ratifying the Istanbul convention</a>, which sets <a href=\"http://www.coe.int/en/web/istanbul-convention/home\" title=\"\">minimum standards for governments to meet when tackling violence against women</a>.

Will your effort be rewarded appropriately? Or will you get a good degree? Those who receive a 2:2, and jauntily tell their friends they \u201cgot a Desmond\u201d because they are at an age where they still find rhyming slang funny, are generally using banter to disguise mild disappointment. It\u2019s a Desmond, sure, but if only they\u2019d occasionally responded to that irksome 11am alarm, it might have got a Trevor Nunn or even a Geoff Hurst.</p> <p>In Test cricket, where colons are replaced by dashes, a 2-2 is nothing to be disappointed about. It\u2019s a rare and admirable thing. There have been only ten 2-2 series draws in Test history, and that result is so much worthier than a 1-1 draw: the players have been through so much more \u2013 look at Moeen Ali\u2019s arc for an example \u2013 and the ebb and flow has been greater. They are Test series in name and nature, and at the end of the series, two weary teams get together to chew the fat over a beer Gatorade.</p> <p>The 2-2s of the modern era were all memorable, heartwarming series: the 1972 Ashes, England v West Indies in 1991 (<a href=\"http://www.alloutcricket.com/features/golden-summer-1991\">READ ALL ABOUT IT HERE</a>) and 1995, Brian Lara v Australia in 1998-99, and England v South Africa in 2003. Most ended with the kind of goodwill that is unique to the hard-fought 2-2 draw.</p> <p>Pakistan want a Desmond here, they want it real bad, and they are in with a fair chance after an excellent morning at the Oval. They reached 97 for two, a deficit of 231, with the nightwatchman Yasir Shah the only man to go. There were also three dropped catches from England. </p> <p>A 2-2 would probably be the right result in what has been a lovely series. For Pakistan, there is additional motivation: a Desmond would probably ensure they are Geoff Hurst in the Test rankings by next weekend. (<a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/1044027.html\">You can view the permutations here</a>.) Pakistan have never been top since the rankings were introduced in 2003. Even if you backdate them to the beginning of time, they have only been No1 for two months in August and September 1988.

There was a modest upward revision (2 tenths of a percentage point) to June\u2019s figure, but it is still a miss. Car sales were actually the strong point of the report, rising 1.1%. There had certainly been some good volume numbers, but with GM having offered deep discounts we thought that the value of auto sales may not be quite so good.</p> <p>In terms of other categories, there was a 2.7% drop in gasoline station sales, due to price falls, but there was also weakness in sporting goods (-2.2%), building materials (-0.5%) and food/beverages (-0.6%). Looking at the \u201ccontrol group\u201d which excludes volatile items and has a better relationship with overall consumer spending growth, it was also flat on the month. This suggests that after a pretty disappointing second quarter GDP, the economy isn\u2019t exactly roaring ahead at the start of the third quarter.</p> <p>We have also had some softer than expected producer price inflation numbers, with the headline annual rate dropping into negative territory at -0.2% year on year, while the core (ex food and energy inflation rate slowed markedly to 0.7% year on year from 1.3%.</p> <p>So with activity being softer than hoped and pipeline inflation pressures looking benign it doesn\u2019t offer much support to the view the Fed will be hiking rates imminently.

Brexit may not have put developers off building yet but this slow down needs to be reversed if enough new homes are to be built over the next few years. Work has dropped quarter-on-quarter and so too has the number of new homes approved in the capital \u2013 with a 22% drop in Q2 2016 from the previous year.</p> <p>But, as ever with construction and house building, it\u2019s all about the pipeline. Next year will see huge construction projects like HS2 and Crossrail take centre stage \u2013 having a huge knock on benefit for housing and infrastructure opportunities. This will open up new areas of London and once the bricks start being laid momentum will keep growing. London desperately needs more homes to be built. Planning inefficiency is one of the main delays leading many developers to re-think projects. One of the new government\u2019s top priorities should be a new willingness to challenge the rigid planning system and bring new homes to London.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ad96bee4b0f231200da2b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T09:29:35.340Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Employers obviously want free movement to continue, according to the NIESR study.

In addition, the public investment plans won\u2019t be reviewed until the Autumn Statement at the end of the year and few construction projects are genuinely \u2018shovel ready\u2019.

In this respect anecdotal indicators are not encouraging with, for example, the construction PMI edging down to a new seven year low of 45.9 in July.

  "<p>The UK government is sticking to plans for a levy on employers to help fund apprenticeships, ignoring business groups\u2019 calls for the charge to be delayed because of the economic uncertainty sparked by the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Some business lobbyists reacted with dismay at the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/views-sought-on-plans-to-boost-apprenticeships\">confirmation on Friday that the levy on larger companies in England will be launched as planned in April 2017</a>. They were already critical of the plan before the referendum result, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/26/fury-over-osbornes-116bn-business-payroll-tax\">claiming it was poorly designed</a> and risked reducing rather than raising the quality of training. </p> <p>Other groups, however, have welcomed the scheme as an important step in addressing skills shortages and a way of broadening young people\u2019s routes into decent careers.</p> <p>Theresa May has made tackling inequality a key theme of her new government, and this marks the second time in a week the prime minister has stood up to big business groups concerned about rising salary bills. On Monday, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/no-10-resists-pressure-to-hold-off-launching-national-living-wage\">Downing Street dismissed pressure</a> to slow the implementation of the \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/01/the-national-living-wage-and-what-it-means\">national living wage</a>\u201d.</p> <p> Robert Halfon, the apprenticeships and skills minister, said the levy would help to ensure \u201cpeople of all ages and backgrounds have a chance to get on in life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cApprenticeships give young people, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, a ladder of \u200eopportunity. That\u2019s why we continue to work tirelessly to deliver the skills our country needs. The apprenticeship levy is absolutely crucial to this,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The levy is designed to fund 3m places for apprentices. It will be paid by employers in England with a payroll of more than \u00a33m and charged at a rate of 0.5% of their annual pay bill. When George Osborne unveiled the levy last year, the former chancellor said those paying it would \u201cget out more than they put in\u201d. </p> <p>The government has also said employers that are too small to pay it \u2013 around 98% of those in England \u2013 will have 90% of the costs of training paid for by the state. Extra support, worth \u00a32,000 per trainee, will also be available for employers and training providers who take on 16 to 18-year-old apprentices or young care leavers.</p> <p>One body for the construction industry described the levy as a \u201cfair settlement for small employers\u201d. The Federation of Master Builders (FMB) said the only cure for the industry\u2019s skills shortages was to recruit and train more people.</p> <p>The FMB\u2019s chief executive, Brian Berry, said: \u201cSmall and medium-sized firms do the majority of training in our industry. Micro businesses [those employing fewer than 10 people] alone train around half of all construction apprentices. It is therefore crucial that new apprenticeship funding arrangements work for these firms and do not impose higher costs on them.\u201d</p> <p>The CBI, which represents companies that employ nearly 7 million people, has criticsed the levy and called on the government to push back the April 2017 start date.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI\u2019s director general, said: \u201cWe welcome the government\u2019s focus on growing investment in apprenticeships, and business stands ready to step up and increase its own commitment. However, the apprenticeship levy in its current form risks turning the clock back on recent progress through poor design and rushed timescales.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe levy is too narrowly defined. It covers only one type of training and employers can only reclaim off-the-job costs. As a result, valuable forms of training risk being cut back, with quantity put ahead of quality.\u201d</p> <p>The trade group for the human resources sector, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), said the levy in its current form risked devaluing apprenticeships by putting the number of beneficiaries ahead of the quality of training they receive.</p> <p>Ben Willmott, the CIPD\u2019s head of public policy, said: \u201cIt is irresponsible for the government, particularly in a time of economic uncertainty in the aftermath of the referendum, to simply press ahead with a policy that is not fit for purpose.\u201d</p> <p>Employer groups have also <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/02/uk-apprenticeships-plan-attacked-employer-groups\">said the levy could prompt some firms to rebadge existing jobs as apprenticeships</a> to meet training targets and recoup the costs of the charge.</p> <p>The British Retail Consortium also called for a delay. \u201cThe government should delay its introduction to 2018, allowing more time to design a truly viable system that delivers high-quality training,\u201d said Helen Dickinson,its chief executive.</p> <p>The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the support for those taking on 16 to 18-year-old apprentices, but also urged the government to focus on quality. The manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF welcomed plans to increase funding for apprenticeships in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, but it too said questions remained over the levy\u2019s design and it pushed for a later start date.</p> <p>The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), however, said the government was right to launch the levy in April.</p> <p>\u201cFollowing Brexit, British employers may not be able to rely on recruiting migrant workers to fill skills gaps, so we\u2019ll need more apprenticeships to train up our domestic workforce,\u201d said Jonathan Clifton, IPPR\u2019s associate director for public services.</p>",
  "<p>Mexico is where I first discovered my love of produce, through its markets and the extraordinary variety of ingredients found in them. I\u2019ve been fascinated by the squash and pumpkin family ever since my first trip to the country: in Mexico, pumpkins feature in sweet and savoury dishes alike, while their protein- and mineral-rich seeds have been ground and used to thicken and enrich sauces for thousands of years. Courgettes have a similar allure, not least because in Mexican markets huge bags of the flowers are sold for next to nothing, unlike the eye-watering prices we\u2019re charged here. They\u2019re used in all sorts, too: stuffed with cheese and/or vegetables, crammed into tacos, omelettes and other street food. Mexican courgettes come in all sizes, shapes and colours, in just about every hue of white, green and yellow.</p> <p>Today\u2019s recipes, then, are a homage to the courgette. If you can get hold of the flowers, they\u2019ll look very pretty laid out across the top of the frittata; alternatively, stuff them with goat\u2019s cheese, saute until hot, drizzle with honey and serve with the salad.</p> <h2><strong>Roast courgette frittata with mint, chives and smoked mozzarella</strong></h2> <p><strong> <br></strong></p> <p>Roasting concentrates the flavour of the courgettes and, combined with the fennel seeds and smoked cheese, gives this frittata an intense, almost meaty savouriness. Serves six.</p> <p><strong>4 courgettes, cut into \u2018coins\u2019 about 1-2cm-thick</strong><br><strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong><br><strong>1 tsp fennel seeds</strong><br><strong>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br><strong>3 courgette flowers (optional)</strong><br><strong>50g butter</strong><br><strong>1 bunch spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced</strong><br><strong>8 eggs</strong><br><strong>1 big handful fresh mint leaves, roughly chopped, plus a few extra to serve</strong><br><strong>1 heaped tbsp chopped chives, plus a few extra to serve</strong><br><strong>200g scamorza (smoked mozzarella) or regular mozzarella, drained and sliced</strong></p> <p>Heat the oven to 230C/450F/gas mark 8. Toss the courgettes in a bowl with the oil and fennel seeds, and season generously. Spread out on an oven tray and roast for 15-20 minutes, until they\u2019re tender and blistering slightly. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. If you have courgette flowers, remove the stigmas and stamens, then open them out like butterflies.</p> <p>Melt the butter in a large, nonstick frying pan over a medium heat, then gently fry the spring onions for a couple of minutes, until softened. Beat the eggs in a bowl, mix in the mint and chives, then season well and pour into the softened onions. Cook for a minute or so, until you can see the bottom begin to turn opaque, then scatter the roast courgette pieces: don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t fit them all on \u2013 save the excess for another dish (they\u2019re lovely served cold or at room temperature, scattered with a little fresh mint, as a salad or side dish). If you are using courgette flowers, layer these on top of the roast courgettes, then lay the cheese on last.</p> <p>Keep cooking the frittata until the base and edges are done, and just the middle remains loose and uncooked. Transfer the pan to a hot grill and cook until the centre is solid and the cheese has melted. Once the frittata is ready, leave it to stand for five minutes, then run a knife around the edge, loosen the bottom gently with a spatula, then slide it on to a plate. Scatter with some mint leaves and chives, and serve warm or at room temperature.</p> <h2><strong>Roast courgette, herb, pistachio, apple and giant couscous salad</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44380f50d0bfb08195ace0736788eef7f075ca22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44380f50d0bfb08195ace0736788eef7f075ca22/0_84_1881_1129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers\u2019 roast courgette, herb, pistachio, apple and giant couscous salad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers\u2019 roast courgette, herb, pistachio, apple and giant couscous salad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian.

Top and tail the courgettes, then finely slice lengthways \u2013 I find a vegetable peeler is the best tool for this job. Toss the courgette strips in two tablespoons of the oil, transfer to an oven tray, season and roast for 10 minutes, until golden and juicy; halfway through, roast the pistachios on a separate tray for the last five minutes. Take both trays out of the oven; when the nuts are cool, chop them roughly.</p> <p>Meanwhile, toast the couscous in a pan with a tablespoon of oil, until golden, then pour on the hot stock and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer and cook for six to eight minutes, until tender.</p> <p>Toss the courgettes through the couscous along with the rest of the ingredients, tearing up the herbs and courgette flowers, if using, as you throw them in. Season generously, dribble over a little more oil, if you like, and serve warm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/05/lamb-burger-recipe-potato-pea-feta-salad-buttermilk-honey-apricot-cake-thomasina-miers\">The weekend cook: Thomasina Miers\u2019 healthy burger recipe</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>And for the rest of the week\u2026</strong></h2> <p>Although the frittata is at its best warm from the oven, it\u2019s also fine at room temperature, making it great for a picnic or lunch box.

A lack of awareness of the amount of calories contained in snacks, difficulty keeping track of how much they ate and the surprising regularity at which people ate were all common concerns of those who responded. </p> <h2>\u2018I forgot about the late-night peanut butter sandwich\u2019 \u2013 Gemma, 52</h2> <p><strong>What did you eat and drink over 24 hours?</strong></p> <p>Drink: three large espressos, two litres fizzy water throughout day, two cups of tea with splash milk.</p> <p>Food: one large orange, 250g mushrooms saut\u00e9ed in olive oil, two large tomatoes, carb-free noodles, 100g cheddar cheese, half a jar of pesto, handful blackberries, piece of celeriac bake (1/4 grated celeriac mixed with about 70ml cream, garlic and nutmeg, topped with 50g chopped nuts and about 25g hard white cheese), large green salad dressed with two tablespoons hummus, small bowl roasted nuts, two pieces vegan mint chocolate, one slice of bread with peanut butter. </p> <p><strong>Were you surprised by how much you ate?</strong><br></p> <p>I work hard to only drink that much coffee, and I do drink a lot of water. But I was surprised at how much food I\u2019d eaten when it was all written down. I forgot about the late night peanut butter sandwich until I started writing. I try not to snack in the late evening but often fail.</p> <p>I\u2019m fairly active, I do 30 minutes of exercise a day on a rowing machine and walk about two miles every day. I was a very overweight child but lost most of it as a young adult when I stopped eating meat. I\u2019ve been about 10lb overweight for most of my adult life, give or take, then when I gave up smoking about a decade ago I gained about four stone. I managed to shift it by cutting out all sugar and exercising more but it took years longer to shift than it did to gain. I am back to the size I am happy with, but I have to work at maintaining it. <br></p> <h2>\u2018I no longer crave sweets and bread and I have started eating offal\u2019 \u2013 Siobhan, 37<br></h2> <p><strong>What did you eat and drink over 24 hours?</strong></p> <p>Drink: 1.5 litres water, two large cups coffee, broth.</p> <p>Food: one rasher of bacon, one fried egg yolk, one fried tomato, two tablespoons sauerkraut, 50g chicken liver pate, one tbsp coconut fat, one egg white mixed with linseed flour, hemp flour, chia seeds and 1/2 tablespoon baking powder and salt fried as a kind of bread patty, 30 grams of butter and some olive oil, one avocado, 30g olive oil, lemon juice, homemade stock, four brazil nuts and four almonds, 30g smoked salmon, 50g of chicken curry, spinach.<br></p> <p><strong>Were you surprised by how much you ate?</strong></p> <p>I had put on a lot in the last three to four years, but I used to be very slim. But I went low-carb a year ago and lost 15 kg. Now I have a low BMI. My weight dropped straight to what I weighed in my early 20s. My weight has been very stable for the last 10 months (60kg, 1.77m). I would like to gain a bit of weight but it is almost impossible on a very low-carb diet. I am cycling to increase muscle mass.</p> <p>Sometimes I only eat two meals. I never feel tired or ravenously hungry during daytime as long as I am in ketosis. I can eat a large fatty breakfast and cycle 10 miles to work immediately after without feeling sick like I used to after eating muesli or sandwiches. Sometimes I eat nothing before cycling and feel just as energetic. </p> <p>Last week I fell out of ketosis after being invited to a Chinese restaurant. It didn\u2019t taste good and I felt dreadful for two days. Dry, fat-free meat and sickly sweet sauce with vegetables. Disgusting. Some people think my diet is restrictive. It\u2019s not really, I\u2019m just missing out on tasteless, dry stuff that hardly contains anything really useful.</p> <p>My research into nutrition has changed my life. I am absolutely stunned by the results of changing my diet. It has had amazing health benefits \u2013 energy, sleep, mood stability, memory. It has been like turning the clock back 20 years. I no longer crave sweets and bread and I have started eating offal. The effects were so astonishing that I have started craving things like liver and veal brain. Never ever would I have even considered trying something like that a year ago. I still can\u2019t believe I gave that a go.</p> <p>I am finding it increasingly difficult to take any aspect of nutrition science seriously. It is full of over-simplifications and irresponsible advice. I am very shocked about what I have learned by digging a bit deeper than most people would. I cannot make up my mind whether current nutrition advice is driven by profits, stupidity or the mental inflexibility.</p> <h2>\u2018I wouldn\u2019t usually eat so much popcorn but I went to the cinema\u2019 \u2013 Ruby, 21<br></h2> <p><strong>What did you eat and drink over 24 hours? </strong></p> <p>Drink: Lots of water throughout the day, few cups of tea (no sugar), glass of orange juice. </p> <p>Food: Bowl of fruit and fibre and semi-skimmed milk with banana. Slice of malt loaf, banana, less than a quarter of a cheese and pickle sandwich , 10/12 chocolate buttons, mocha with skimmed milk. Three potato wedges, half a breaded cod fillet, carrots, broccoli, small half potato skin with cheese. Four to five handfuls of \u201cskinny\u201d popcorn.</p> <p><strong>Were you surprised by how much you ate?</strong></p> <p>I usually have somethings sweet with lunch but the chocolate buttons were because I don\u2019t sleep well and it\u2019s been getting worse. I remember professor Lupin making Harry Potter eat chocolate when he fainted so I had some when I thought I was going to pass out. <br></p> <p>I\u2019m not employed at the moment so I\u2019ve not been out and about much. I\u2019m going to the gym for an hour every day with at least 30 minutes intense cardio and about 15 minutes of weights and 10 minutes of lighter cardio to make up for the lack of moving around. </p> <p>I try not to snack but almost always do. If lunch is bigger than the above, I try to keep some of it for later in the afternoon and snack on that. I still live at home and when I\u2019m at home there\u2019s always biscuits in the cupboard. I eat more when the Great British Bake Off is on because I love that show and always end up in a baking frenzy.</p> <p>I do put weight on easily. My metabolism is pretty slow for a fairly active young woman. Whenever I put weight on it sits around my middle so it\u2019s really obvious. If I put weight on, I find it quite hard to loose it healthily so I have to be careful. My partner is very tall and naturally slender and could eat the provisions of an army without putting on any fatty-weight. I try and cook as much as I can for my family and partner from scratch so I know what\u2019s going in the food. <br></p> <p>A bikini-based holiday is coming up soon so I\u2019ve been trying to be careful because of that too. Being the small, round, white-as-snow potato next to a tanned, tall, athletic guy on the beach is not funny. That\u2019s not a sum of my self-worth but rather to explain how annoying it is that he will eat ice cream all day and still look like he\u2019s wandered off Mount Olympus. </p> <h2>\u2018At work there is always chocolate and sweets around\u2019 \u2013 Sally, 37<br></h2> <p><strong>What did you eat and drink over 24 hours? <br></strong></p> <p>Drink: I only drink water during the week \u2013 unless it\u2019s a day I go out and have alcohol.</p> <p>Food: Two boiled eggs, two heaped tablespoons of greek yogurt, handful of blueberries and one tablespoon chia seeds, one massive sausage in a bun with ketchup and mustard small piece of chicken, pork chop with green beans in oil and vinegar.</p> <p><strong>Were you surprised by how much you ate?</strong></p> <p>I don\u2019t calorie count but know when I\u2019m eating too much of something. Normally I have a salad containing leaves, three slices of parma ham and a chunk of cheese cut into pieces with a plum or peach. I only had the hot dog because I was out and about with work. I tend to have a snack of cheese or maybe four or six mini chorizos but I had a busy day at work and didn\u2019t buy any.<br><br>At work there is always chocolate and sweets around so if I wasn\u2019t being good I\u2019d have had maybe three chewy sweets or a smallish piece of chocolate. </p> <p>I tend to pay attention to what I eat and drink, although I was surprised how little it was. I have a day during the week where I drink and then at the weekends I\u2019m more relaxed with what I eat and normally have alcohol on a Saturday \u2013 a fair amount and much more than recommended. </p> <p>I want to get more toned which means losing fat, but as long as I feel good about my size I\u2019m not worried too much about weight. Muscle weighs more than fat so that must be considered. </p> <h2>\u2018I feel better so now I don\u2019t want to comfort eat my way through a tonne of chocolate\u2019 \u2013 Sian, 38<br></h2> <p><strong>What did you eat and drink over 24 hours?</strong></p> <p>Food: 50g muesli, 150ml semi-skimmed milk, chopped banana, two dessert spoons natural yoghurt, two slices seeded bread, slice of ham, tomato and cucumber, blueberries, chicken gratin with mushrooms and courgette, three new potatoes, green vegetables, berries, natural yoghurt. </p> <p><strong>Were you surprised by how much you ate?</strong></p> <p>I have a four-month-old baby plus an older child. I\u2019m trying to lose the baby weight slowly and not comfort eat in response to feeling tired or frustrated with looking after a baby and a child with additional needs. </p> <p>I want to lose at least 3kg and then 3kg more so I can fit into my ski gear. I have just started exercising regularly in the last five weeks and I feel better so now I don\u2019t want to comfort eat my way through a tonne of chocolate. <br></p> <p>I am trying to avoid eating between meals but if desperate due to sleep deprivation, I try to eat an oat cake or fruit. I know perfectly well what I put in my mouth but I was quite often ignoring these facts. We don\u2019t drink fizzy drinks or consume fruit juice preferring to eat the actual fruit. We do make a lot of our food and try to minimise salt and sugar. </p> <h2>\u2018Sometimes I eat a cooked meal and am a bit horrified about how much oil or fat there is\u2019 \u2013 Helen, 51<br></h2> <p><strong>What did you eat and drink over 24 hours?</strong></p> <p>Drink: five cups of milky instant coffee, water. </p> <p>Food: one piece of brown bread toast, low fat spread, one large bowl of tinned fruit \u2013 grapefruit, peaches, mandarin segments \u2013, two medium-sized brown bread rolls with wafer thin ham, low-fat spread on one side of the roll, two medium apples, one plum, half a bag of mini cheddars, Tesco ready meal \u2013 hoi sin duck with noodles.</p> <p><strong>Were you surprised by how much you ate?</strong></p> <p>If I eat lunch in the canteen at work, I have no idea of the calories I\u2019m consuming. Sometimes I eat a cooked meal and am a bit horrified about how much oil or fat there is, but I can only tell once it\u2019s on my plate.<br></p> <p>I need to lose weight, I haven\u2019t weighed myself for a while but judging by the fact many of my clothes don\u2019t fit any more, and having been to weight loss class in the past, I estimate I need to lose about three stone. I\u2019m therefore making much more of an effort to eat less at the moment.</p> <p>I know I don\u2019t get enough exercise. I sit at a desk most days and I work long hours so often don\u2019t even get to go for a walk at lunchtime. I did try putting half an hour in my diary every lunchtime to create time to go for a walk but it didn\u2019t seem to make any difference, I still never got out at lunchtime. </p> <ul> <li>Some names have been changed.</li> </ul>",
  "<p>As the Rolling Stones\u2019 You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want boomed over loudspeakers after Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Kissimmee, Florida, on Thursday night, an elderly spectator walked by the media enclosure. \u201cTraitor!

If, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/donald-trump-republican-defections-susan-collins\">as every recent survey suggests</a>, he does indeed suffer defeat, it raises the question of what will happen to the 13.3 million people who voted for him in the Republican primaries and whether, ultimately, Trumpism can survive Trump.</p> <p>Several supporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/trump-clinton-mental-stamina-florida-rally\">at Thursday\u2019s rally</a> \u2013 where raucous crowds punched the air and chanted \u201cLock her up!\u201d and \u201cLiar!

Should that happen, some said they intended to remain engaged in politics, but more likely with a third party than with the Republicans \u2013 especially if that party were to revert to establishment figures such as Jeb Bush. That would pose a dilemma for Republican elders seeking to rebuild from the ruins of a potential landslide defeat.</p> <p>\u201cThe liberal media are trying to skewer the vote so we won\u2019t go out and vote,\u201d said Flora Reece, 47, a commercial analyst. \u201cWe know he\u2019s going to win.

I\u2019ll make sure they stay interested.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s post-convention tribulations just prompted Time magazine to publish a stylised image of his head dribbling like hot wax beside a single word headline: \u201c<a href=\"http://time.com/4447985/inside-donald-trump-meltdown/\">Meltdown</a>\u201d. After his unwinnable fight with gold star family Khizr and Ghazala Khan, whose son died serving in Iraq, the candidate attempted to restore discipline last Monday with a major economic speech in Detroit.</p> <p> Yet by Wednesday, he had touched off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">another furore with an off-the-cuff comment</a> widely seen as inciting supporters of the second amendment to assassinate Clinton. A day later, he began repeatedly describing Barack Obama as \u201cthe founder\u201d of Islamic State. He finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/donald-trump-obama-isis-founder-sarcasm\">walked that back</a> in the early hours of Friday morning.</p> <p>As several polls showed the Democrat leading by double digits and beginning to threaten in red states such as Arizona, South Carolina and Utah \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/is-hillary-clinton-contesting-texas-not-really-but-she-is-trying-to-expand-democratic-influence-into-deep-red-territory/2016/08/10/9bf38ad8-5eb7-11e6-af8e-54aa2e849447_story.html\">her campaign is even prodding Texas</a> \u2013 more and more Republicans scrambled for the last lifeboats on the Titanic.

Some supporters, for example, opined that Khizr Khan had been paid $375,000 to denounce Trump \u2013 an unproven claim perpetrated by rightwing websites \u2013 and was therefore fair game.</p> <p>Capt Terry Shields, 66, a war veteran who served in Vietnam in 1969-70, said: \u201cIt was a shame it was brought up by the father in the first place. I think it was a fixed deal. The biggest thing that worries me is the Muslims taking over.

Generalisations are perilous and pose a headache for post-election Republican strategists. Another military veteran, Brett Puffenbarger, 29, said: \u201cI jumped on Trump train fairly early on. He was the only GOP candidate who wasn\u2019t outright against gay marriage and legalisation of marijuana. He was socially liberal and fiscally conservative and that was a big draw for me.\u201d</p> <p>Sabrina Motes, 36, said: \u201cI\u2019m a Jewish American, I used to be a Democrat and I\u2019m college educated. I hate the stereotype that if you\u2019re college educated or Jewish you don\u2019t support Trump.

There are things that can be learned from and things that could be done differently. Republicans were supposed to learn from Mitt Romney but I don\u2019t think they did.\u201d</p> <p>Allegations of rigging were widespread, even though a vote has not yet been cast, but few were willing to predict what kind of backlash there would be. Bob Kunst, 74, a registered but disaffected Democrat sitting behind a cardboard \u201cTrump v Tramp\u201d sign, said: \u201cRight now the anger is intense and if, God forbid, Trump loses, you\u2019re talking revolution. You\u2019ve just had a revolution in Britain with Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>But Charlie van Esler, 60, an investment products seller who supported Marco Rubio in the primaries, said: \u201cI have no reason to believe it would be a rigged election. I respect the democratic process. The idea that Trump supporters are rednecks and yahoos is disingenuous.\u201d</p> <p>Outside the arena, where Trump addressed thousands of (nearly all white) supporters, badges, hats, T-shirts and other merchandise were on sale. The Confederate flag was flying outside a stall run by Ariel Robb, a 26-year-old nurse, who insisted that its message \u201cis more heritage than hate\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He\u2019s the only candidate who says if he makes a mess, he\u2019ll clean it up.

I\u2019m trusting in God.\u201d</p> <p>Whereas Trump has a luxury home in Florida and beat local senator Rubio in the primaries, he fared less well in states such as Wisconsin. Earlier this week in Janesville, where post-industrial melancholy is evident in a closed car plant and eerily quiet downtown, House speaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/paul-ryan-beats-mini-donald-trump-challenger-in-wisconsin-primary\">Paul Ryan crushed a Trump-style challenger </a>in a congressional primary.

The Trump supporters who are motivated by economic factors will gravitate back in a heartbeat. The idea that a party is going to win again by tying itself to voters over 65 is suicidal. Hanging on to this man is suicidal. What surprises me is how many people in the Republican party think their fortunes would be worse if they renounced him. I think people who haven\u2019t, like Paul Ryan, are done.\u201d</p> <p>The Republicans could become the first party to lose the White House for three consecutive elections since the Democrats in 1988. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/04/democratic-republican-party-bill-clinton-hillary-us-election-2016\">A leading architect of the Democratic revival</a> was Al From, who said on Thursday: \u201cFirst the Republicans have got to develop an agenda that people want to vote for, not just a small sliver of the electorate.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got to become more libertarian on cultural issues to appeal to young voters. You have to express views in ways that convey you\u2019re open to other points of views, too. We weren\u2019t going to win pro-life voters in 1992 but they saw Bill Clinton and said: \u2018He\u2019s not a radical on this, let\u2019s look at what he says about other issues.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>From warned: \u201cIf the governors and party leaders don\u2019t take a stronger hand in shaping the party, it\u2019s possible there will be some sort of replacement party. There could be a realignment of the parties over the next two or three elections. With the Republicans it\u2019s more extreme because Trump has hijacked the party from the leadership.

First the party could not bring itself to make that journey by passing a law in Congress \u2013 then Trump came along with his signature plan to build a wall.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.focuswithfrank.com/\">Frank Luntz</a>, a Republican consultant and pollster, also doubts that the maverick tycoon will have a long-term political legacy. He said: \u201cTrump has little formal statewide organisation \u2013 even now. He has loyalists, but they are disorganised. His campaign is being out-raised and outspent by ratios we have never seen in modern politics \u2013 and that\u2019s with just 90 days to go. There is absolutely nothing to suggest that this movement will continue beyond its leader. He has become the most unpopular political figure in America today.\u201d</p> <p>It would be foolish to write the Republican party off, Luntz added. \u201cThe GOP has been through these rough elections before, and they have emerged stronger and more unified much more quickly than prognosticators ever expected. The Goldwater debacle in 1964 led to Nixon\u2019s resurgence in 1968 and a 60% landslide in 1972.</p> <p>\u201cWatergate may have destroyed the GOP in 1974, but Reagan won by nine [percentage points] just six years later and by 20 [points] four years after that. The loss of George Herbert Walker Bush in 1992 was supposed to be the end of the GOP, but they won the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years just two years later. Republicans are a very resilient party, and it doesn\u2019t take long for them to recover.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>When Heather Stanning and Helen Glover waited on the start line to defend their title in the women\u2019s pair, they had never lost a single race together. Seven minutes and 18 seconds later they had still not. Having led from the front in their traditional show of dominance, they crossed the finish line as double Olympic champions.</p> <p>Stanning lifted her partner into the air as they stepped off the boat and on to the pontoon. The pair are usually models of poise and nervelessness \u2013 celebrations can sometimes seem an afterthought to them \u2013 but they have been concealing some not inconsiderable feelings.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been so emotional this week and that\u2019s not me at all,\u201d said Stanning, the army major who followed her 2012 medal with a tour of Helmand Province. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/01/olympics-2012-success-stanning-glover\" title=\"\">Their victory in London was Team GB\u2019s first gold of the Games</a> but Stanning said this one had been an even greater achievement. \u201cIt means so much more,\u201d she said. \u201cWe put an awful lot of pressure on ourselves.</p> <p>\u201cI know it was a home Games and there\u2019s nothing more special but this was defending a title.

The first time it was all new to us, this time round we crossed the line and we were Olympic champions, rather than realising it six months later. We both felt it more this time.\u201d</p> <p>Stanning and Glover have dominated the women\u2019s pair category for four years \u2013 this was their 39th consecutive win \u2013 and they bossed this race in the style to which they, and the opposition, have become accustomed.</p> <p>By the 500m mark they had gained 13 metres on Denmark, the only team to have challenged them in this competition. In the heat Hedvig Rasmussen and Anne Andersen had occasioned a rare mis-step from the British women, who were forced to come from behind to win. Stanning and Glover left them for dead on Friday and at halfway were 3.38sec in front of the nearest boat.</p> <p>It might have been a repeat of their victory in London were it not for a brave effort from New Zealand\u2019s Rebecca Scown and Genevieve Behrent, who pulled back their lead in the final third, while never looking close to overcoming them.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not done until it\u2019s done,\u201d said Stanning. \u201cWe knew it was important to get a good start and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d And then, with a smile of self-criticism, she added: \u201cTo be fair I think my first stroke was pretty shoddy.

  "<h2><strong>Richard Ford</strong></h2> <p>My old mentor and friend Shelby Foote used to say that a person couldn\u2019t understand the United States without understanding the American civil war.

From questioning \u2013 completely without justification \u2013 Obama\u2019s birth and religion, to opposing virtually all Obama\u2019s policy initiatives, to slandering the president personally, to denying his actual right to hold office, the right wing formally and informally waged a campaign not only to discredit our legally elected head of state but, in essence, to erase him.</p> <p>Okay, I said I was naive; but this shocked me. And it puzzled me. What was it about Barack Obama that incensed the right to such bizarre extremes? Here is a superbly intelligent man, dignified and persuasively presidential, a good communicator, an exemplary \u201cfamily man\u201d, remarkably scandal free; he knows the US constitution, he was and is strongly supported by the other party. He in every demonstrable way has had the country\u2019s best interests clearly in his sight. One could disagree with him policy to policy. But the right\u2019s reaction was outsized and\u2026 well\u2026 mindless. And all these views \u2013 to get around to the point \u2013 are the views put forward by Trump, both today and for the past nearly eight years.</p> <p>It couldn\u2019t just be his race \u2013 could it? \u2013 that set the right so against the president? Though, in America, one cannot \u2013 must not \u2013 ever discount the lowest sort of political urgings, and must never overlook race prejudice as a motive for most anything. If it quacks like a duck, etc.</p> <p>All of what I heard in the rightwing contumely, then and now \u2013 including Trump\u2019s stump speeches in the past week \u2013 certainly reminded me troublingly of the anti-integrationist, anti-black, so-called states rights \u2013 now hygienically rebranded as \u201cnativist\u201d or \u201cpopulist\u201d \u2013 calumny from my apartheid youth in Mississippi: the unrelenting attempt not just to disempower African Americans as political actors, but to extirpate them. How might I inform myself better about this growing sense of unease regarding the president\u2019s race being a primary consideration \u2013 acknowledged or unacknowledged \u2013 in the right wing\u2019s intransigence?</p> <p>Well, first, I thought, read about the civil war, the vast crucible of American race politics, the \u201cproving ground\u201d where vitriolic, mindless anti-black rhetoric found its full voice and first prominent advocates. And what was the best history of the American civil war? Everyone knew that \u2013 probably even Shelby Foote, who wrote two volumes of his own.

The eponymous antihero is a hypocrite and a conman. He has a patchy sexual past and a history of heavy drinking, yet sells himself as a convert to evangelical religion, teaming up with Sister Sharon Falconer, who leads impassioned revivals throughout the midwest. Manipulative and cunning, Gantry is driven to accrue wealth through religious hucksterism, but also power; he feeds off the roar of the crowd. He\u2019s a narcissist and a fraud who has left multiple ruined lives in his wake.</p> <p>The main difference between Gantry and Trump is that Gantry is portrayed as genuinely charismatic. Lewis\u2019s preacher gets his leg over figuratively and literally because, as a performer, he\u2019s mesmerising. Trump is not charismatic. He is artless and politically clumsy, and wears his egotism on his sleeve. Nor is Trump mesmerising, except in the sense that a train wreck is mesmerising. Gantry\u2019s success in pulling the wool over people\u2019s eyes is understandable: he has a silver tongue, and on stage he\u2019s larger than life. Trump can\u2019t string a single grammatical sentence together, and at the podium he is lumpen and awkward. As a fictional character, Gantry works, and Trump doesn\u2019t. As Mark Schorer, an American academic, observed: \u201cThe forces of social good and enlightenment as presented in <em>Elmer Gantry </em>are not strong enough to offer any real resistance to the forces of social evil and banality.\u201d Some things never change.</p> <p>\u2022 Lionel Shriver\u2019s latest book is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-mandibles-a-family-2029-2047.html\"><em>The Mandibles</em></a> (Borough).</p> <h2><strong>David Hare</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1b2a606d305bf47371498ff354ce348a0bcb372\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1b2a606d305bf47371498ff354ce348a0bcb372/842_541_3967_2380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Hare - photographed in his writing studio in North London Photograph by DAVID LEVENE For SATURDAY\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Hare.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last December, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/08/trumps-repeated-claim-that-obama-is-accepting-200000-syrian-refugees/?tid=a_inl\">Donald Trump claimed </a>that President Obama planned to let 200,000 Syrian refugees into the US in 2016.

Woodard explores the US as a cluster of 11 different cultures, some of which we share with our neighbours, Canada and Mexico. In order to understand Trump and his appeal, I think we can focus on Appalachian culture, which was exported from the Scottish borders in the 18th century, and was marked by an affinity for conflict and evangelical protestantism. These people had been trained to do battle in the Scottish wars, were later put to work in the coal mines, and are now out of work (the most evocative portrait of the lives these immigrants left behind and what they did when they got to America is in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/albion-s-seed.html\">David Hackett Fischer\u2019s <em>Albion\u2019s Seed</em></a>). Another intransigent American culture is that of the deep south, slaveholders who came to the US from the sugar plantations of Barbados and were much more hierarchical and ruthless than the slaveholders in Virginia.</p> <p>Perhaps the most interesting and relevant nation, though, is New Netherland, founded in 1624, a partly Dutch nation, very diverse, not religious, but authoritarian and corporate (run by the Dutch West Indies Corporation).

An increasingly global, mobile and craven class, Lasch contended, isolates itself in its social networks and physical cocoons, a flight not only from daily experience in public spaces but a political abandonment of the working and middle class that also betrays basic democratic practices and values. Though they differ in temperament and outlook, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton personify versions of Lasch\u2019s self-protecting privileged class, whose careers and lives contribute to the breakdown of an inclusive, national democratic culture.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A man who made a fortune from golf courses, Trump now presents himself as the voice of the silenced white masses</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Were he alive, Lasch might eviscerate these two very different elites, beholden to different privileged interests yet nonetheless falling over themselves to champion the \u201ccommon\u201d person.

Jesus,<em> </em>Barton explained, was not only \u201cthe most popular dinner guest in Jerusalem\u201d, and \u201can outdoor man\u201d, but a \u201cstartling example of executive success\u201d. \u201cHe picked up 12 men from the bottom ranks of business and forged them into an organisation that conquered the world.\u201d This may sound ludicrous, but it is also the <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of America\u2019s long conflation of business with religion, and it speaks to the equally absurd rise of Donald Trump as a politician that somehow millions of Americans believe \u2013 in the face of astounding evidence to the contrary \u2013 will save them. It is a triumph of faith, indeed.</p> <p>Trump is fond of claiming in messianic terms that he alone can save America, and restore the American Dream. The historian who coined the phrase \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d in a book called <em>The Epic of America</em>, would, I suspect, disagree. In 1931 James Truslow Adams argued that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/25/american-dream-great-gatsby\">chasing the spectre of wealth</a> is what got America into the mess of the Depression; he carefully traced that ideology back to the 19th century, when there developed a \u201cnew conception of business as somehow a social and patriotic duty\u201d. This is the ideology into which Trump has tapped so powerfully: the idea that business success is itself a virtue to be ranked above all others, to be worshipped. (We must put aside, evidently, concerns over what kind of \u201csuccess\u201d Trump is precisely held to have achieved, and by what means.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The world Fitzgerald envisioned was one in which character was increasingly sacrificed for wealth \u2013 Trump\u2019s world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Faith in business was an idea much on the minds of Americans in the 20s, during the so-called boom presided over by three successive \u201cbusinessmen\u201d presidents, including Calvin Coolidge, who declared in 1925 that \u201cthe chief business of America is business\u201d. This idea was so widespread that it was itself the target of the bestselling American novel of 1922, Sinclair Lewis\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/11/100-best-novels-babbitt-sinclair-lewis-robert-mccrum\"><em>Babbitt</em></a>. In its opening pages, George Babbitt gazes upon a bank tower and Lewis tells us: \u201cHe beheld the tower as a temple-spire of the religion of business, a faith passionate, exalted, surpassing common men.\u201d In 1926 Lewis\u2019s <em>Elmer Gantry</em> satirised the hypocrisy of selling religion, while a year earlier Scott Fitzgerald skewered the same attitudes when he said that Jay Gatsby was a son of God and must about \u201cHis Father\u2019s Business: the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty\u201d. The idea that someone in service to the American worship of wealth could through sheer force of will drive himself near to the top is at the heart of Fitzgerald\u2019s morality play. The world that he envisioned was one in which character was increasingly sacrificed for wealth \u2013 and that is the world that Trump embodies, and which he would like to rule.</p> <p>A decade after Barton said that Jesus was the best businessman of all, Lewis wrote <em>It Can\u2019t Happen Here</em>, a dystopian satire responding to the rise of fascism in Europe by imagining a populist demagogue who becomes a totalitarian president of the United States.

By that standard the world has never had a democracy. Political scientists such as Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, authors of <em>Democracy for Realists</em>, who study how democracies really work are repeatedly astonished by the shallowness and incoherence of people\u2019s political beliefs and the tenuous connection of those beliefs to their votes. Most voters are ignorant not just of current policy alternatives but of the most elementary facts about politics and history, such as the major branches of government or which countries have used nuclear weapons. Their opinions flip depending on how a question is worded: they say that the government spends too much on \u201cwelfare\u201d but too little on \u201cassistance to the poor\u201d, and that it should use \u201cmilitary force\u201d but not \u201cgo to war\u201d. When they do formulate a preference, they commonly vote for a candidate with the opposite one. Nor does voting provide a feedback signal on a government\u2019s overall performance. Voters punish incumbents for recent events over which they have dubious control, such as macroeconomic swings and terrorist strikes, or no control at all, such as droughts, floods or even shark attacks.</p> <p>Achen and Bartels suggest that most people correctly recognise that their votes are astronomically unlikely to affect the outcome of an election and so they prioritise work and family over educating themselves about politics. They use the franchise as a form of self-expression: they vote for candidates who they think speak up for their kind of people.</p> <p>\u2022 Steven Pinker is Johnstone professor of psychology at Harvard and author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/better-angels-of-our-nature.html\"><em>The Better Angels of Our Nature</em></a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/a-sense-of-style.html\"><em>The Sense of Style</em></a> (Penguin).</p> <h2><strong>Mark Lawson </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"857e26bc1bd021d9241c176aad4328b47b5c813a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/857e26bc1bd021d9241c176aad4328b47b5c813a/0_551_2945_1767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Lawson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Lawson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abigail Zoe Martin/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To the horror of the Washington establishment, a gabby maverick with no record of political office uses his celebrity, in a depressed and paranoid America, to fuel a furious movement that threatens the hegemonies of politics, corporations and the media. Considering the insurgent unthinkable, they plot to stop him.</p> <p>The year is 1934, and Upton Sinclair, a well-known journalist and author, has sensationally won the Democratic nomination to be governor of California. Sinclair is now most remembered as the writer of industrial documentary novels such as <em>The Jungle</em>, set in the Chicago meat yards, and <em>Oil!,</em> which was adapted as the Oscar-winning movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/08/paulthomasanderson.drama\"><em>There Will Be Blood</em></a>. His most enduring legacy, though, has proved to be a quixotic bid for public office, which introduced two perversions \u2013 subsequently recurrent \u2013 of the political process. Sinclair\u2019s gubernatorial race was the beneficiary of one campaign innovation \u2013 the power of an anti-political candidate in times of crisis \u2013 and the victim of another: the use of negative media \u201cattack ads\u201d against an opponent. These tropes seem to have reached their apotheosis in the 2016 US presidential election.</p> <p>Ideologically, Sinclair most resembles Bernie Sanders. Both men were socialists who became Democrats for specific electoral purpose. However, in his takeover of a major party in a key campaign, Sinclair most spookily previews Donald Trump. Like Trump, he terrified the elders of his adopted affiliation and the media by being widely viewed as too peculiar to rule. Smeared as politically reckless (in his case, for \u201ccommunist\u201d views), Sinclair was attacked for his evangelical vegetarianism and tendency to speak from candour rather than calculation. The outsider\u2019s rise was seen as so threatening to the status quo that the incumbent Republican governor, Frank F Merriam, responded with a campaign that included the first recorded use of a hostile screen commercial, funded by Hollywood and screened in cinemas.</p> <p>Greg Mitchell\u2019s 1992 book about these events, <em>The Campaign of the Century</em>, although historical, has tended to find topical resonance. It was first published in the election year in which an independent presidential candidate, Texas oilman H Ross Perot, became the most successful non-politician presidential candidate until Trump. In 2011, it was released for the first time as an ebook, because, as Mitchell acknowledged in a preface, he saw, in the Occupy Wall Street grassroots movement, parallels with EPIC, and wanted to offer Sinclair as both a warming and warning example to the new wave of progressive protestors.</p> <p>As it turned out, the 1934 template had less relevance to the 2012 presidential election, when an incumbent president received a handsome re-endorsement, than had seemed likely in the febrile atmosphere leading up to the vote. <em>The Campaign of the Century</em>, though, proves a useful handbook to the present political convulsions in America, although liberals will read it now looking for clues to how a feisty outsider can be stopped.</p> <p>What ultimately finished Sinclair was that the intervention of a strong third party candidate, Raymond L Haigh of the Progressive party, split the anti-establishment vote and allowed Merriam to be re-elected, helped by the media touting him as the sensible or at least safer option.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible that, in November, either the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson or the ex-CIA agent Even McMullin, a last-minute anti-Trump runner, can do a Haigh for Hillary, spreading the resentment. The larger question, though, is which candidate will be left standing after the Trump and Clinton campaigns and their proxies have engaged Merriam-like negative tactics against each other.</p> <p>The American decision in 2016 sees the polarities of California 34 reversed \u2013 the maverick a regressive rightwinger, a Democrat running as the defender of sanity and capitalism \u2013 but the parallels are otherwise uncanny. Upton Sinclair, an unfairly neglected writer of political fiction, is a more lasting presence as a ghost in the political machine.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Lawson\u2019s latest book is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/allegations.html\"><em>The Allegations</em></a> (Picador).</p> <h2><strong>Oliver Burkeman</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfc6f8cefd235b9add7ce48efa2c7ffa88949430\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfc6f8cefd235b9add7ce48efa2c7ffa88949430/0_1482_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Burkeman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Burkeman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Lane</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Long before Donald Trump started<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\"> dropping hints about political assassination</a>s, death was a looming presence in his speeches.

The book\u2019s trio of authors \u2013 Sheldon Solomon, Jeff Greenberg and Tom Pyszczynski \u2013 have spent many years running experiments in which participants are reminded of their inevitable fate (\u201cPlease briefly describe the emotions that the thought of your own death arouses in you\u201d, goes one typical mortality-reminder exercise) to see how it changes them. Their results endorse the hunch set forth with brilliance, but little scientific rigour, by Ernest Becker in his masterpiece <em>The Denial of Death</em>. Unable to accept the fact that our lives are finite, we seek symbolic immortality \u2013 often through child-rearing or creative work or devotion to great causes, but sometimes to demagogues instead.</p> <p>\u201cSensing a way to feel significant again,\u201d they write, \u201cpeople join the cause of the seemingly larger-than-life leader as a revitalised basis for self-worth and meaning in life.\u201d Whether he\u2019s conscious of it or not, Trump triggers the fear of death in his audiences, then presents them both with various specific \u201csolutions\u201d (a wall to keep out Mexicans, a ban to keep out Muslims) and one big implicit promise: merge symbolically with the wealthy, domineering Trump himself, and feel powerful again.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s popularity has been variously attributed to racism, misogyny and economic insecurity; but the authors show how all these only get their urgency from the unspoken, underlying fear of literal demise. And perhaps, in the end, there\u2019s a glimmer of hope in this. There\u2019s been a regrettable tendency among liberals to write off Trump supporters as utterly irredeemable \u2013 bigots we can never hope to understand, much less change.

All-American Dorothy and her charming sidekicks trip off to the dazzling Emerald City to seek help from the mighty wizard of Oz. The awesome eminence promises to give them everything they desire if they kill off his biggest (female) rival first. But when they return to claim their rewards, they discover that \u201cOz, the Great and Terrible\u201d is a cowering little ventriloquist from Omaha. \u201cAre you not a Great Wizard?\u201d Dorothy exclaims.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Not a bit of it, my dear; I\u2019m just a common man.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019re more than that,\u2019 said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; \u2018you\u2019re a humbug.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Since the 1960s it has been fashionable to read Oz as an allegory of turn of the century populism: the yellow brick road represents the gold standard, the Emerald City stands in for paper dollars, and so on. One doesn\u2019t need period analogies to see a connection to the 21st-century populism of Trump, who blinds voters with sham opulence, terrifies them into submission, and promises to make their wishes come true.</p> <p>Dorothy is the real saviour of the book (Baum\u2019s wife, it\u2019s worth noting, was a prominent suffragist), but even when they\u2019ve exposed the wizard as a fraud, she and her friends turn to him for aid. \u201cHow can I help being a humbug,\u201d chuckles Oz the not-so-great, \u201cwhen all these people make me do things that everybody knows can\u2019t be done?\u201d</p> <p>A self-help reading might observe that the characters don\u2019t need a wizard to give them brains, heart, or courage. They just have to believe in themselves. A profound loss of faith among the white working class explains why today\u2019s Dorothy (and particularly her Uncle Henry) will probably vote for Trump.

But no issue has been more important to Trump\u2019s success than race. Trump has given vent to many white voters\u2019 fears and anxieties about the loss of racial privilege and status, and run the most avowedly ethnonationalist presidential campaign since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/11/civil-rights-anniversary-11-june-1963\">George Wallace</a>. And while many have argued that the effectiveness of Trump\u2019s racially coded appeals is tied to rising inequality and the economic woes of the working class voters who constitute Trump\u2019s base, it would be more accurate to say that Trump is tapping into a vein of working class racism that has been a part of American politics for a long time.</p> <p>That\u2019s why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stan-greenberg\">Stanley Greenberg</a>\u2019s <em>Middle Class Dreams </em>helps explain so much about Trump\u2019s rise. It was published in 1995, but much of it is based on Greenberg\u2019s work in Macomb County, Michigan, following the 1984 presidential election. Macomb was a nearly all white suburban county just outside of Detroit. It had been a solidly Democratic county in the 60s, giving sizeable majorities to both JFK and Lyndon Johnson. But in 1972 66% of Democratic voters in Macomb supported George Wallace in the Democratic primary, and in the general election Richard Nixon carried the county easily. In 1980 Macomb voted for Ronald Reagan, and in 1984 he took two-thirds of the vote. In other words, these working-class voters, who had once supported progressive candidates, had shifted decisively to the right.</p> <p>What Greenberg discovered in his many interviews with Macomb voters was that they felt that the Democratic party had abandoned them, that it had stopped paying attention to the concerns of working people and the striving middle class, and started paying too much attention to the concerns of black people and other minorities. The fundamental problem Macomb voters had with the Democrats was the party\u2019s embrace of civil rights in the 60s.</p> <p>What <em>Middle Class Dreams</em> demonstrates is just how important race, and racism, was in shaping many voters\u2019 political attitudes. As Greenberg puts it, \u201cthese white defectors from the Democratic party expressed a profound distaste for black Americans, a sentiment that pervaded almost everything they thought about government and politics\u201d. More than that, \u201cnot being black was what constituted being middle class; not living with blacks was what made a neighbourhood a decent place to live\u201d. When the Democratic party started to take civil rights seriously and to embrace (however tepidly) antiracism, many white working class voters saw it as a betrayal.</p> <p>More than 40 years after Wallace, Trump is tapping into these same currents. The list of outsiders that many white voters fear the encroachment of is longer now: it includes Muslim and Latino immigrants as well as African Americans. But what <em>Middle Class Dreams</em> shows is that the conviction of Trump supporters that white Americans have been forgotten, and that the country is going to hell as a result, is not new. It\u2019s all too old.</p> <p>\u2022 James Surowiecki is author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/wisdom-of-crowds.html\"><em>The Wisdom of Crowds</em></a> (Anchor).</p>",
  "<p>There is a certain kind of person who just takes to summer. When the mercury rises to heatwave proportions, they wholly embrace the scorching rays, casually shedding some (though not, all) of their clothes to reveal a glowing body. If they are not dark already, an hour in the sun sees their skin immediately turn a gorgeous nut brown, dotted with constellations of attractive freckles. They glide, scented, through air as thick and sticky as hot soup, exuding cool, never wilting. They stop wearing shoes and take wholly to nature, letting their salted hair flow untamed and beachy, for they are a child of the seasons. They are the gods and goddesses of our endless picnic days. Summer literally becomes them.</p> <p>I am not a summer person. I am the person sitting pink, sweaty and panting on someone else\u2019s wall, gulping down water, as my vision goes fuzzy and black in the corners. Don\u2019t get me wrong: many of us non-summer people adore summer, it is just that summer does not adore us. How and why does it hate us? Let me count the ways.</p> <h2><strong>Sunburn</strong></h2> <p>British people are infamous for their strict adherence to the motto \u201csun\u2019s out, buns out\u201d, immediately opting to tear off all their clothes the minute there is a hint of hot weather. These people sneer at factor 30, crying: \u201cPass me the baby oil, base tans are for losers!\u201d Flash forward two hours and the curse of the lobster is upon them, yet there they are, bravely trying to soldier on, sipping on a Grolsch and trying to act casual (note: this is impossible when severely sunburnt).</p> <p>Those of us who have come to terms with the Celtic pallor of our skins have usually learned our lessons the hard way and now take preventive measures that some may call extreme. We are the people who, on discovering a beautiful, unspoilt stretch of white sandy coastline offset by a turquoise sparkling sea, will say, \u201cRight, let\u2019s find some shade.\u201d This, despite the fact that we are in long sleeves, a sun hat, shades, slathered in sunblock and carrying a parasol. In the absence of said shade, we are forced to lie bathed in sweat under a towel, groaning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42e2b1d0b6b918f120695168ac37998147fe6108\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42e2b1d0b6b918f120695168ac37998147fe6108/554_556_3790_2274/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman with sunburn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brits are infamous for their strict adherence to the motto \u2018sun\u2019s out, buns out\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Allergies</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s a glorious summer\u2019s day, but are you able to enjoy it? No, you are not, for the pollen count is dangerously high, and your eyes and nose are streaming so much that, while you can hear the clink of ice in cider glasses (a conceit Brits have adopted entirely uncritically from television advertising), you can hardly see all the beautiful people enjoying themselves around you in the beer garden, unhampered by pintloads of mucus. On top of this, your eyeballs are on fire and you ran out of non-drowsy antihistamines so you\u2019re falling asleep in your seat, possibly for ever, because you heard they don\u2019t mix well with the copious amounts of ros\u00e9 you convinced yourself you needed to numb the ache in your sinuses.</p> <p>You dream of spending one of those idyllic summer days pootling along country lanes in a vintage car, only to pull over next to a spectacular cornfield teeming with wildflowers for picnicking, frolicking, etc. But such cinematic moments are sadly denied you, the hayfever sufferer. Quite frankly, you\u2019d rather do the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43eMCobo15c\">Bez dance</a> through a minefield.</p> <h2><strong>Sweating</strong></h2>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am actually shining. I am a reflective surface. You could do cocaine off my forehead \u2013 only it would stick</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cHow can it be?\u201d you ask yourself, as you stand in front of the mirror glistening. \u201cSummer is supposed to make everyone infinitely more attractive in preparation for long, lusty, jasmine-scented evenings of seasonal shagging. Instead, I look uglier than I have ever looked. I am actually shining. I am a reflective surface. You could do cocaine off my forehead \u2013 only it would stick, like everything else touching any part of my body. I seem to have developed a moustache composed entirely of moisture.\u201d</p> <p>Sweating is in many ways a form of labour. There\u2019s the cost and annoyance of always having to pack a second T-shirt, the time-consuming act of always having to check the chair after sitting in it, and the humiliation of asking your colleagues whether they have any deodorant. And that\u2019s before you even get to other people\u2019s sweat. Anyone who has taken public transport during rush hour in August will know the unique horror of being penned in on all sides as a man\u2019s forehead drips on to your bare skin like Chinese water torture.</p> <h2>Chafing</h2> <p>For those women without a \u201cthigh gap\u201d (about 95% of us), summer is a time when walking anywhere in extreme heat will see your inner thighs rubbing together like a pair of oiled, wrestling piglets, resulting in \u201cchub rub\u201d \u2013 a humiliating condition not unlike nappy rash that results in friction burns and searing pain. Along with thrush, chub rub has to be up there on the list of Bullshit That Women Put Up With\u2122 that only gets worse in summer.</p> <h2><strong>Insect bites</strong></h2> <p>If you\u2019re the kind of person who wakes up in a room you\u2019ve shared with eight other people to find yourself the only one covered in insect bites, then summer is a terrible time for you, my friend. And I feel your pain. I don\u2019t know what it is they love about us (our skin, our blood, our sheer, winsome chemical magnetism), but love us they do, and as a double whammy, we will often suffer from a physical overreaction to said bites. I have had bites bigger than my own face, on my face. Once, on holiday in Greece, I had a bite on my eyelid that made it look as though I had been beaten up, making breakfast in a local taverna very awkward for my boyfriend, who was forced to make a quick exit before becoming the victim of a vigilante justice mob.</p> <p>I am that person begging Canadian tourists for antihistamines in a hotel lobby, after being told by a Cuban doctor that a pus-filled bite on my thigh meant I could develop encephalitis and die. Try putting a hazy Instagram filter on that.</p> <h2><strong>Fainting</strong></h2> <p>An Italian friend of mine told me recently that his ideal temperature is 38C, a statement the mere hearing of which made me want to go and lie down in a dark room in my pants. Take it from someone who has regained consciousness in the back of a van full of ripped French firemen (they send les pompiers in very tight polo shirts for medical emergencies) and did not enjoy it: there is such a thing as too hot, and for me, that is around the 27C mark. Anything higher will bring on an attack of the vapours. Pathetic, I know, but there we have it. Hot weather turns me into a Victorian lady in need of a six-month convalescence on a chaise longue in a stately home in order to feel strong enough to even think about getting back on my horse.</p> <h2><strong>Bad hair</strong></h2> <p>You know those summer babes, with their beachy, salt-sprayed hair. All they\u2019ve done is gone for a wild swim and run their fingers through their locks afterwards, and yet they look as if they have strolled off the pages of a siren-themed Vogue photoshoot. Meanwhile, the humidity has turned your barnet into a nest of mad frizz, while your now-vertical fringe has developed a multitude of strange kinks. Somehow, the weather has resulted in your having a cowlick, a perm, and a widow\u2019s peak all at once.</p> <h2><strong>Sleeplessness</strong></h2>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You toss, and turn, and sweat, and groan as the temperature refuses to drop and the drunks argue outside your window</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You toss, and turn, and sweat, and groan as the temperature refuses to drop and the drunks argue loudly outside your open bedroom windows. Somewhere in the room you hear the buzz of a mosquito, but you\u2019re too tired to get up and deal with it, so you cower beneath the sheet in the hope that the thin membrane of fabric will protect you from the inevitable bloodsucking. You\u2019ve tried everything: cold showers, sleeping under a wet towel, naked, buying a cheapo fan from Argos, cotton underpants, but still, the sleep refuses to come. Meanwhile, next to you lies a peaceful summer god or goddess snoring lightly. Amazingly, they are fragrant in their repose, and dry to the touch, and you hate them for it. What dark magic is this?</p> <h2><strong>Booze</strong></h2> <p>You are drunk. You cannot remember a time when you have not been drunk, so long have you been drinking. Everyone else is drinking too, of course, the heat demands it. \u201cRos\u00e9!\u201d someone shouted, around lunchtime, in the beer garden, and a bottle was bought. You drank it, warm, like juice, then moved on to prosecco; fluorescent cocktails with umbrellas in; a can or two of Foster\u2019s. You protected your Pimm\u2019s from a cloud of wasps by sprinting across a croquet lawn, then decided to have another gin and tonic, maybe a cheeky mojito. You feel slightly woozy and restless, you can\u2019t remember the last time you had a drink of water. You think the midges might have got the backs of your calves. You barely slept last night and there\u2019s a heat rash on your shoulders. Sweat pools in your bellybutton; you can feel your nose starting to peel. The hayfever is back. But it\u2019s OK, because you\u2019re pissed. You ignore that nagging feeling and pose for the photographs. When you look at them, later, you see a stranger looking back at you. She is smiling, but there is pain behind her eyes. Her skin is the colour of deli meat. Her hair looks atrocious. This is what summer\u2019s about.</p>",

The hope of being with him no longer exists.\u201d</p> <p>The life and death of Luis G\u00f3ngora occurred at the intersection of twin crises: homelessness and police killings. Amid a tech-fueled economic boom, the major cities of the US west coast have become as notable for their sprawling homeless encampments as they are for their billion-dollar companies.</p> <p>Seattle has Amazon, and the Jungle. Los Angeles boasts Snapchat, and Skid Row.

His father, Demetrio, worked as an assistant for the local butcher, where he was paid in meat rather than cash. His mother, Estela, raised nine children in a one-room Mayan hut with a thatched palm roof and dirt floor. She rose at 5am each day to prepare the <em>k\u2019eyem</em> (corn flour mash, diluted in water) for the family to drink for breakfast.</p> <p>When the children were sick, there was no money for medicine, so Demetrio treated their ailments with traditional herbal medicines.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His father, Demetrio, worked as an assistant for the local butcher, where he was paid in meat rather than cash</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps because of this poverty, Luis G\u00f3ngora would eat anything. He shot <em>loros</em> \u2013 small green and yellow parrots with just a few ounces of meat on them, if that \u2013 out of trees with a slingshot, and prepared them like poultry. If he came across a deer, he would try to shoot it and lug it home. The fat black iguanas that skulked among the rocks were good for a meal as well.</p> <p>When Luis G\u00f3ngora was just 12 years old, he left school and went to work. His younger brother, Jos\u00e9, followed a few years later. The pair were the youngest of the G\u00f3ngora siblings, and wherever Luis went, Jos\u00e9 followed. They did not like school, never learned to read, and were both more comfortable speaking Mayan than Spanish.</p> <p>\u201cWe dedicated ourselves to the fields,\u201d Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora said.</p> <p>G\u00f3ngora met his future wife, Fidelia del Carmen, when they were 14.

Many men travel to Canc\u00fan, M\u00e9rida, or Chetumal six days a week \u2013 or for an entire tourist season \u2013 to earn money to support their families.

As word of mouth and family connections grew, it turned into something of a migration highway in the early 2000s. There are estimated to be 50,000 Yucatecan migrants in the San Francisco Bay Area, 90% of them undocumented, 80% of them Mayan-speaking, and 70% of them male.</p> <p>Thousands of Yucatecos work in the kitchens of San Francisco\u2019s thriving restaurant scene, and the wages earned there are visible in the landscape of Yucatecan towns, where construction workers and modern houses are a sure sign of a relative in San Francisco.</p> <p>A few blocks from the central square of Oxkutzcab, a neighboring town to Teabo, a two-story structure featuring the iconic bay windows of San Francisco\u2019s Victorian townhouses rises above a dusty intersection.

Their mother pawned her gold earrings to pay the fee for a <em>coyote</em>, and Jos\u00e9 arrived in San Francisco on September 11. The first thing he saw was news footage of the Twin Towers falling.</p> <p>Assisted by a network of cousins already established in San Francisco, Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora soon found work as a dishwasher and began sending money home.</p> <p>As Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora\u2019s wife, Julia, began to build her house, Luis G\u00f3ngora, whose family still lived in a Mayan hut in the land behind his parent\u2019s house, itched to join his brother. He sold a horse and a summer\u2019s harvest and left for San Francisco in September 2002.</p> <p>The 31-year-old migrant could be forgiven for having high expectations. Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s cousin and childhood friend, Luis Armando Poot Pat, had been living in San Francisco for 12 years, and his experience hewed closely to the American dream. After arriving in the US, Poot had found work at a restaurant as a janitor.</p> <p>Twenty-six<strong> </strong>years later, Poot is the manager at the same restaurant. His wife and children were able to join him in San Francisco. One of his sons is studying biochemical engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p> <p>When Poot ran across Luis G\u00f3ngora at the main intersection of the Mission district, a historically Latino neighborhood where the Yucatecos often cross paths, he was able to quickly set his cousin up with a job as a prep cook at Mel\u2019s Diner, a 1950s throwback restaurant where the milkshakes are thick and the staff wear white paper caps and bow ties.</p> <p>After bouncing around different buildings in the Mission for a few years, Luis and Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora settled in an apartment at 1751 Market Street, where they roomed with another man from Teabo, who they called El Torero.</p> <p>A non-descript apartment building upstairs from a popular piano bar, 1751 Market became known as San Francisco\u2019s most \u201c<a href=\"http://sf.curbed.com/2015/4/16/9969980/inside-the-nightmarish-infested-building-at-the-center-of-the-soma\">nightmarish</a>\u201d, \u201c<a href=\"http://sfist.com/2015/04/17/this_may_be_san_franciscos_most_dis.php\">disgusting</a>\u201d apartment building when a group of tenants <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1875519-valencia-market-lawsuit.html\">sued</a> the landlords for $10m in 2014.

No other people speaking Mayan \u2013 he couldn\u2019t get a stable job. He was short of money.\u201d</p> <p>El Torero, the roommate, left San Francisco and returned to Teabo to pursue his dream of being a bullfighter. (He died, gored by a bull, in 2013). Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora found a job in the suburbs, doing landscaping work, and returned to the apartment infrequently.</p> <p>It was around this time, Castro said, that Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s  drinking and marijuana use transitioned into more serious drug abuse. Another Yucatecan in the building was dealing heroin, and Castro believes Luis G\u00f3ngora got hooked.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora says that he never saw his brother using hard drugs, but he was not around much to see.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08ebda6d2a3bf0adf94761e335539b1b294ee57e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08ebda6d2a3bf0adf94761e335539b1b294ee57e/0_149_2333_2917/800.jpg\" alt=\"Luis Poot got his cousin Luis G\u00f3ngora his first job as a prep cook in San Francisco, but they later lost touch. \u2018I didn\u2019t know how to help him.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luis Poot got his cousin Luis G\u00f3ngora his first job as a prep cook in San Francisco, but they later lost touch. \u2018I didn\u2019t know how to help him.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Burton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is unclear exactly how the brothers came to be evicted from 1751 Market. Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora says that he was still leaving money for rent, but he doesn\u2019t know if the money made its way to the landlord. Poot says that, once El Torero left town, the G\u00f3ngora brothers struggled to \u201cmanage the household\u201d since neither could read or speak English.</p> <p>Either way, in the fall of 2013, Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora returned to the Market Street building to find his apartment locked and his belongings in the trash. He salvaged a bag with some photographs and personal items and was out on the street.</p> <p>Homelessness was a harrowing experience for both of the brothers, and the crisis forced them in different directions. Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora stayed with friends for a few days, and then found a room in a residential hotel for a week.</p> <p>\u201cFirst I lost my home, and then I lost my job,\u201d he said. \u201cI had this bag of stuff. How was I going to arrive at work with this bag of stuff?\u201d</p> <p>The brothers lost track of each other.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was living on the street, I saw Sapo once,\u201d Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora said, using a family nickname for his brother. \u201cI said, \u2018Where are you living? On the street also?\u2019 I said, \u2018Each one of us is on our own path.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora later slept in public transit stations or on buses. One day he went to the police station, hoping to turn himself in and get deported to Mexico. The police told him to go away, unless he wanted to be locked up.</p> <p>After two weeks of sleeping in a park, Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora convinced his cousin Poot to take him in. It wasn\u2019t easy. Jos\u00e9 was skinny and unclean, but more than anything, Poot said, he was traumatized.</p> <p>Poot took over, imposing strict rules and caring for Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora until he recovered. Poot found him a new job, stopped him from drinking, and took control of his finances, sending all of his wages back to his family.</p> <p>\u201cJos\u00e9 has always been well-behaved. When they were kids, Luis was like the boss, the dad. Jos\u00e9 was the one following orders,\u201d Poot explained.</p> <p>Since 8 November 2013 \u2013 the day Poot accepted him into his house \u2013 Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora has not had a single beer or sip of alcohol.</p> <p>\u201cNo beer, no marijuana, only work,\u201d Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora jokes.</p> <p>Poot tried to arrange a similar rescue for Luis G\u00f3ngora, who was still on the streets, but with little success.</p> <p>\u201cLuis always wanted to make his own decisions,\u201d Poot said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. If Luis had come knocking on my door instead of Jos\u00e9, maybe I would have helped him instead, but fate put Jos\u00e9 in my path.\u201d</p> <p>Poot\u2019s brother, Wilberto, tried to take Luis G\u00f3ngora in, but he didn\u2019t follow the rules of the house \u2013 not going out at night and ringing the doorbell, staying out of sight of the landlord \u2013 and it didn\u2019t work. Poot paid for Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s documents to be sent to San Francisco so he could send his cousin back to Mexico, but Luis lost the papers. Another relative took Luis G\u00f3ngora to live in San Jose, but again Luis returned to the streets.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to help him,\u201d Poot said. \u201cHe had no house, no money, no job, no papers \u2013 so many issues.\u201d</p> <p>The longer he was homeless, the worse Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s mental state seemed to get.</p> <p>\u201cHe would be confused when he was talking to you. Sometimes he would be fine, and sometimes he would just be talking to himself on the street,\u201d Poot said.</p> <p>For a while, Luis slept on the sidewalk in front of the building where his brother and cousin lived in an apartment with Poot\u2019s wife and children.</p> <p>\u201cI was very sad, because I told him at some point, don\u2019t come knocking on the door because if the owner sees you, he might be given a reason to throw us out,\u201d Poot recalled.</p> <p>Despite his downward spiral in San Francisco, Luis G\u00f3ngora kept up appearances with his family in Teabo. He never told them that he was homeless. He didn\u2019t talk about himself.</p> <p>\u201cThe saddest part is that the family is learning now how he was living. Luis\u2019s mom asked me, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u2019\u201d Poot said. \u201cI never told them because I thought it would cause them sadness.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cf1d4329fa4bb829409273e1f77caeabf1464dc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf1d4329fa4bb829409273e1f77caeabf1464dc2/0_35_4232_2539/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s widow stands with their daughter, two sons and grandchildren at their home in Teabo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s widow stands with their daughter, two sons and grandchildren at their home in Teabo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Gabaldon/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora was at the laundromat on 7 April when he heard police sirens. He didn\u2019t think of it again until the next day, when he was at work. He had a bad feeling. He told his manager that he needed to leave early, that he needed to go look for his brother.</p> <p>When he arrived at the homeless encampment where Luis G\u00f3ngora had been living for the past few months, Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora asked for his brother\u2019s whereabouts by miming kicking a soccer ball. A homeless outreach worker from a neighborhood non-profit grabbed his arm and said, \u201cGet your strength.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very important for us Mayans, once a person is dead, to honor them,\u201d Poot said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re alive, you can defend yourself, but once you\u2019re dead, you have to honor them. In the Mayan culture, a deceased one is sacred.</p> <p>\u201cLuis is never going to die. As long as we remember him, he is going to live with us. We\u2019re always going to honor him.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>The broad details of G\u00f3ngora\u2019s death are made plain by security video provided to the Guardian by a neighbor who asked to remain anonymous because he feared police retaliation. The camera caught images of G\u00f3ngora in his final hours, the arrival of the police, and audio of the beanbag and live ammunition being fired.</p> <p>What is in dispute are the exact actions of the police and G\u00f3ngora during the final 30 seconds that led up to the shooting.</p> <p>G\u00f3ngora was sitting just out of the frame of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/12/luis-gongora-homeless-san-francisco-police-shooting-video\">the video footage</a>. The story of his killing can only be composed by the testimony of the police who killed him and the witnesses who saw it happen.</p> <p>The fatal encounter was set in motion when two homeless outreach workers went to the homeless encampment where Luis G\u00f3ngora lived, responding to a report that a baby was crying. The workers did not find a baby, but police say the outreach workers saw G\u00f3ngora \u201cswinging [a knife] indiscriminately as he walked down the street\u201d, prompting them to call the police.</p> <p>Former San Francisco police chief Greg Suhr told members of the public that G\u00f3ngora was \u201cseated on the sidewalk with a large knife and the blade pointed up\u201d when police officers arrived on the scene. (Suhr was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/19/san-francisco-police-greg-suhr-resigns-fatal-shooting-scandal\">fired</a> in May shortly after San Francisco police shot and killed an unarmed black woman in a car.)</p> <p>\u201cThey tried to shoot him in the arm to get him to drop the knife,\u201d Suhr told reporters when asked why police officers deployed beanbag rounds at a seated man.</p> <p>The San Francisco police department alleged that, after being struck by the beanbag rounds, G\u00f3ngora stood up and \u201ccharged\u201d, \u201clunged\u201d or \u201cran at\u201d at the officers with the knife, prompting them to fire in self-defense.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to know if before I die there will be justice for Luis</p> <footer> <cite>Estala, mother of Luis G\u00f3ngora</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Guardian has interviewed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/12/witness-san-francisco-police-shooting-homeless-man-luis-gongora\">six eyewitnesses</a> to the shooting. They include three homeless residents of the encampment who were standing on the sidewalk about 20 yards from the shooting, two residents of apartments overlooking the street, and one pedestrian who was on the sidewalk opposite to the incident. All of them contest the police version of events.</p> <p>\u201cI would by no stretch of the imagination say that he was charging them,\u201d said S Smith Patrick, a documentary film-maker who had an unobstructed view of the shooting from her second-story window across the street. \u201cHis body was recoiling from bullets.\u201d</p> <p>The incident is subject to three independent investigations, by the police department, the San Francisco office of citizen complaints, and the district attorney. A civil rights attorney representing G\u00f3ngora\u2019s widow and children has filed a claim against the city of San Francisco, a precursor to a civil lawsuit for wrongful death and excessive force.</p> <p>\u201cBased on multiple eyewitness accounts that are part of our preliminary investigation, Luis G\u00f3ngora lunged at one of our officers with a large knife,\u201d a spokesman for the city attorney said in response to the lawsuit. \u201cG\u00f3ngora posed an immediate and deadly threat, and our officers\u2019 use of lethal force was necessary and legally justified.\u201d</p> <p>The legal process is likely to take years, a fact that is difficult for G\u00f3ngora\u2019s family in Teabo to accept.</p> <p> G\u00f3ngora\u2019s mother, Estala, cried as she sat in a hammock in her house in Teabo. As the 87-year-old woman broke into tears, no one reached out to touch her or comfort her. Instead, her daughter-in-law and granddaughter grabbed pillows and began to fan her with cool air from behind.</p> <p>\u201cI want to know,\u201d she said, \u201cif before I die there will be justice for Luis.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>In the living room of Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s house, Maria Guadalupe Cruz sat in a chair before a shrine to her brother-in-law Luis, leading a roomful of women in <em>el rezar</em> \u2013 the prayer.</p> <p>It was 7 July, the morning after police in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, shot and killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philando-castile-shooting\">Philando Castile</a> during a traffic stop and two days after police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, shot and killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alton-sterling-shooting\">Alton Sterling</a> while he was selling CDs.</p> <p>The deaths of those two men made international headlines, sent protesters into the streets across the US, and drew the attention of Barack Obama, but here in Teabo, 7 July was the three month anniversary of a tragedy that continues to play out on a smaller stage, in the living room of the house that the homeless man built.</p> <p>\u201c<em>Cuando te rezo, puedo comprender que una madre no se cansa de esperar,</em>\u201d Cruz sang. \u201cWhen I pray to you, I understand that a mother does not get tired of waiting.\u201d</p> <p>Teabo is a woman\u2019s town, and a town where the women have grown accustomed to waiting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5ce47edc0f984bd5048214c775c24260c5845cf5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ce47edc0f984bd5048214c775c24260c5845cf5/0_248_4288_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s mother, Estela, sits at the entrance to the traditional Mayan house where her son and his wife lived when they were first married.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s mother, Estela, sits at the entrance to the traditional Mayan house where her son and his wife lived when they were first married.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Gabaldon/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They wait for their husbands, fathers, and sons to come home from the places they go to find work: the <em>ejido</em>, the big cities of Yucat\u00e1n, or San Francisco.</p> <p>Luis G\u00f3ngora left Teabo almost 14 years ago.

  "<p>Privately operated government prisons, which mostly detain migrants convicted of immigration offenses, are drastically more unsafe and punitive than other prisons in the federal system, a stinging <a href=\"https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2016/e1606.pdf#page=2\">investigation</a> by the US Department of Justice\u2019s inspector general has found.</p> <p>Inmates at these 14 contract prisons, the only centers in the federal prison system that are privately operated, were nine times more likely to be placed on lockdown than inmates at other federal prisons and were frequently subjected to arbitrary solitary confinement. In two of the three contract prisons investigators routinely visited, new inmates were automatically placed in solitary confinement as a way of combating overcrowding, rather than for disciplinary issues. </p> <p>The review also found that contract prison inmates were more likely to complain about medical care, treatment by prison staff and about the quality of food. </p> <p>Contract prisons almost exclusively incarcerate low-risk inmates convicted of immigration offenses. These facilities house around 22,000 individuals, mostly deemed \u201clow risk\u201d, at an annual cost of $600m. They are operated by three private companies: Geo Group, Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), and Management and Training Corporation (MTC). </p> <p>Investigators determined that these facilities were also more dangerous than others in the federal system.

As a result, contractor deficiencies went uncorrected and corrective actions were delayed.\u201d </p> <p>The inspector general recommends that the US justice department should convene a \u201cworking group\u201d to probe the causes of the disparity in safety standards between contract prisons and publicly operated facilities, and states that federal government should strengthen oversight provisions across the board.</p>",

Financial backing for anti-trafficking programmes in Piedmont, Sardinia, Basilicata<strong> </strong>and Liguria will also cease.</p> <p>Anti-trafficking NGOs in areas affected by the cuts have warned this will leave Italy with a patchy and insufficient response to the increased trafficking of migrants entering the country.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s incredible \u2013 there is a decree by the government saying that the protection of the trafficking victims has to be ensured at national level and the ministry of equal opportunities is leaving out almost six regions [Piedmont, Liguria, Valle d\u2019Aosta, Basilicata, Sardinia and much of Sicily] at a time when the problem of trafficking is getting worse,\u201d said Alberto Mossino from Progetto Integrazione Accoglienza Migranti (Piam), an anti-trafficking and migrant rights NGO in Asti, in the Piedmont region of Italy.</p> <p>Mossino said that Piam, which in 2014 was presented to the Council of Europe by the Italian government as <a href=\"https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=0900001680631cc2\">an example of best practice in anti-trafficking initiatives</a>, was told this week that all of their funding will be cut from the beginning of September.<br></p> <p><strong> </strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2016/aug/08/freeing-girls-trafficked-to-italy-for-sex-from-nigeria-you-will-not-be-a-slave-for-ever-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4pkck\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2632763\"            data-video-name=\"Freeing girls trafficked to Italy for sex: 'You will not be a slave for ever' - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a4c678e4b0f5d064840acb\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/05/160805ItalySexTrafficking_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/05/160805ItalySexTrafficking_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/05/160805ItalySexTrafficking.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/08/05/160805ItalySexTrafficking_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/08/05/160805ItalySexTrafficking_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2016/aug/08/freeing-girls-trafficked-to-italy-for-sex-from-nigeria-you-will-not-be-a-slave-for-ever-video\">Freeing girls trafficked to Italy for sex: \u2018You will not be a slave for ever\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cOur region is one of the worst affected by the sexual trafficking of migrant women and children. The women that are now in our protection programmes will see these programmes shut down with short notice. We have been told that they will be transferred; this means that they will be forced to restart all the paths they are going though,\u201d said Mossino.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cLife will be easier for traffickers operating in Sicily, or in Piedmont and other regions where these cuts have been made. This means that here in Piedmont there will be no outreach programmes. Any victim of trafficking who wants to escape will have to go on their own to their police to denounce their exploiters, there will be nobody to help them through this process.\u201d</p> <p>Penelope, an anti-trafficking organisation in Messina, Sicily, has also been informed of an immediate and total funding cut, said Cettina Restuccia, a coordinator with the NGO.</p> <p>\u201cWe are seeing more and more young Nigerian teenagers arriving [on the migrant boats]. Many have been already raped and forced to prostitution during the trip from Nigeria to Libya,\u201d said Restuccia. \u201cBut if we are not at the ports when the boats arrive in \u2013 or in the hospitals or reception centres, or at the commission hearings \u2013 who will help these girls?\u201d</p> <p>The IOM expressed concerns about the consequences of the cuts. </p> <p>\u201cThe risk is that the places available for the trafficking victims in protection programmes will decrease and we are particularly worried for the unaccompanied minors,\u201d said Simona Moscarelli, an anti-trafficking expert at the IOM. \u201cThere should be an increase, not a decrease, in the anti-trafficking interventions, particularly in Sicily.\u201d</p> <p>The ministry of equal opportunities defended the decision, saying it was increasing the amount of anti-trafficking funding from \u20ac8m (\u00a36.9m) to \u20ac13m but that more resources would be channelled into a smaller number of service providers.</p> <p>The ministry added that a \u201ctechnical error\u201d made in the application for funding by administrators in the Liguria and Piemonte regions had triggered cuts to anti-trafficking initiatives. The decision to end funding to NGOs in eastern Sicily was put down to concerns over the quality of the services provided, but the department expressed confidence that the grant given to Ragusa would cover services across the island.</p> <p><br></p> <p> </p>",
  "<p>Although the Olympics only occur every four years, it seems like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/iocs-response-to-russia-doping-scandal-nothing-more-than-a-confused-mess\">doping</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/chinese-swimmer-bulgarian-athlete-fail-drug-tests-rio-2016-olympics\">scandals</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/drugs-in-sport\">modern day Games are inevitable</a>, as much a part of the whole thing as national anthems and people drooling over <a href=\"http://www.capitalfm.com/photos/tom-daley/\">divers</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnclarke/2012/07/29/despite-protests-and-new-bikini-rules-olympic-beach-volleyball-gets-full-exposure/#5ae9e0eb7645\">volleyball players</a>. </p> <p>Despite the consequences of getting caught, athletes representing their country at this level are going to be pressured, both by their own ambitions and from all sides, to increase their odds of winning by any means necessary, up to and including doping. It may even be their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/russia-doping-scandal\">home country</a> itself pressuring them into this.</p> <p>So we have something like a war of attrition; Olympic authorities going to extremes to stamp out <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport\">doping</a>, and competitors and other involved groups to extremes to use doping without being detected. </p> <p>It\u2019s a costly, restrictive and time consuming process which detracts from the inspirational nature of the tournament itself. But here\u2019s a radical solution: why not just allow doping? Let all the athletes take whatever drugs they like and let them get on with it?</p> <p>It\u2019s not as unusual a suggestion as you might think. I\u2019ve heard it numerous times, usually in pubs after a few drinks. It was put forward as a question at a recent recording I did of the <a href=\"http://leveluphuman.com/\">Level Up Human</a> podcast. Marina Hyde acknowledged it in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/lilly-king-olympian-rio-2016\">her recent post for the Guardian</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3c039d19c92c3ab571995b5c863e72aff8400c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3c039d19c92c3ab571995b5c863e72aff8400c9/0_319_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this Monday, July 18, 2016, An Indonesian health official prepares a vaccine injection during a revaccination program for children who were earlier given fake vaccines, at a community health center in Jakarta, Indonesia.

Dropping the constant tests and checks would save much time and money. It wouldn\u2019t be \u201cunfair\u201d, as every athlete has access to the same drugs, so it levels the playing field. It could even make it more inclusive: people normally get to be top athletes because of \u201cunfair\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130925112343.htm\">genetic</a> <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2012/08/12/the-dna-olympics-jamaicans-win-sprinting-genetic-lottery-and-why-we-should-all-care/#255ba2b52263\">advantages</a>, so those who normally couldn\u2019t keep up can use drugs to compensate and stay competitive. And, potentially, it could make the games far more interesting. World records constantly being smashed, athletes being faster, stronger, more enduring. What\u2019s not to like? So yes, why not just allow doping in the Olympics? </p> <p>Sadly, this is not a rhetorical question. It turns out that, rather than being limited to slightly-inebriated discussions among friends, the notion of an Olympics where doping is permitted has actually being <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21244107\">scientifically studied</a>. And it should perhaps come as no surprise to find that, according to all available data, legalised doping in the Olympics would be an absolutely terrible idea. </p> <p>Firstly, the idea that allowing doping would make things fairer is ludicrous. People seem to forget it\u2019s performance <em>enhancing</em> drugs, not performance <em>creating. </em>Basically, if you\u2019re a 20 stone trucker with a dodgy hip, a course of steroids and hormones is not going to turn you into a world-class athlete. <a href=\"http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/athletic-drug-test.htm\">Performance enhancing drugs work in a number of ways</a>, but performing miracles isn\u2019t one of them. You <em>still need to be a top athlete </em>for them to have any useful effect, so any notion that doping would allow \u201cnormal\u201d people to compete should be abandoned.</p> <p>It would still be something of a genetic lottery as well. How people respond to drugs is <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v1/n1/full/nrd705.html\">heavily influenced by their own personal physiology and genes</a>, and this is equally true for performance enhancers. If anything, a doped Olympics would be more exclusive, not less, as it would favour those individuals lucky enough to be born with bodies that are physically better at sport whilst also more responsive to the positive effects of doping and resistant to the negative consequences. No doubt such people are relatively rare, even among the already-small pool of world-class athletes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8bb6b3eb8010f58706493a333668120cc25ff41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8bb6b3eb8010f58706493a333668120cc25ff41/0_129_2428_1456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this July 3, 2016, file photo, English Gardner, winner, from left, second place, Tianna Bartoletta, and third place, Tori Bowie finish the women\u2019s 100-meter final at the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials in Eugene, Ore.

Top athletes <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538475/\">put their bodies through punishing regimes with long-term consequences as it is</a>. Making doping compulsory would only drastically increase the <a href=\"http://www.usada.org/substances/effects-of-performance-enhancing-drugs/\">risk of serious damage to the health of an athlete</a>. And it would be compulsory; the odds of someone at that level relying on the \u201cnatural\u201d approach when all their competitors are doped up to the extremes are laughably small.</p> <p>A regime of doping to get the best possible result would require a team of dedicated medics monitoring athletes and their reactions, plus a regular supply of the latest and most effective performance-enhancing substances, so there goes any notion of efficiency and cutting costs. </p> <p>Again, this would make the playing field more uneven, not less. Countries like the US and China would have the resources and infrastructure to obtain the best performance enhancers for their athletes and maximise their safety when using them. What chance would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/05/helplessness-rio-hope-olympic-refugee-team\">the Refugee Olympic Team</a> have in this scenario? </p> <p>We\u2019d likely end up with more regulation as well, as organisations have to determine which drugs are allowed where and when to ensure fairness in the contest.

Then we would be where we are now but faster/higher/stronger by 5-10%, depending on event and drugs used.\u201d</p> <p>So there we have it. The Doping Olympics: no fairer or cheaper or any more entertaining, much more dangerous, and serving only to undermine the achievement of every athlete involved and remove any inspirational element from the tournament.</p> <p>It seems the only real use for a Doping Olympics would be to say it\u2019s going ahead, then immediately ban any athlete who shows up to compete.

  "<p>Krys Lee\u2019s debut novel, <em>How I Became a North Korean</em>, opens with a description of a lavish banquet hosted in Pyongyang by the dictatorial \u201cDear Leader\u201d. The guests wear fur coats and Rolex watches, and sit at a mahogany table, eating delicacies flown in from the Tokyo Tsukiji fish market by private jet. Following the meal, the host raises his hand: \u201ca glittering disco globe came down from the ceiling and the Joy Brigade began strutting in pink hot pants to a banned American pop song\u201d. One couple, a senior party official and his wife, whose story we are following, are among those obliged to dance. Suddenly the mood changes, and the evening ends with the official shot dead, and his wife and son, Yongju, forced to flee the totalitarian state across the heavily patrolled border into China.</p> <p>Yongju\u2019s tale of escape is told alongside those of two other fugitives in the border area: Jangmi, a young North Korean woman who has become pregnant after a relationship with a married man; and Danny, a Korean-American. Betrayal, cruelty and violence lie ahead of them, as well as the possibility of salvation, in different forms. All three face desperate hunger; Jangmi trades sex for survival. When we meet, Lee says that halfway through writing her characters\u2019 interlinked narratives, she wasn\u2019t sure herself whether they were going to make it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/13/north-korean-defectors-america-reality\">North Korean defectors see American dream deferred as reality sets in the US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lee, whose book of short stories, <em>Drifting House</em>, deservedly won much praise when it was published in 2012, has been active for more than a decade helping defectors from North Korea, and draws on this work in her novel. She writes in English, having been educated in the US and the UK, but was born in Seoul, South Korea, and has lived there for some time. \u201cI am always going to be on the side of people who have survived,\u201d she says, \u201cand who have experienced things that most of us are lucky not to have faced.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea\">North Korea</a> is the site of one of the world\u2019s refugee crises, and Lee\u2019s novel is, among other things, a timely exploration of the fate of individuals who take desperate and perilous journeys away from persecution or extreme hardship. Over the years, she has listened to many nail-biting accounts of flight: the usual escape route for North Koreans is across the Tumen River, but because the DPRK is an ally of China, the Chinese authorities hunt down defectors and often send them back \u2013 where they face torture, detention, even execution. They are thus forced to remain in hiding, while brokers and agencies \u2013 with luck \u2013 organise their onward journey.</p> <p>Lee is keen to convey that behind the Orwellian grotesqueries of the North Korean dictatorship there are \u201cordinary\u201d people, with family and community ties, aspirations and memories. (The title of the novel hints at the political identities imposed on us all.) She is scathing about China\u2019s human rights record on refugees from the DPRK and tells of South Korean activists being tortured by electrocution and even dying in Chinese jails. In contrast, she has always been protected by her US passport. \u201cThe meaning of citizenship has troubled me for a very long time, why certain people have rights and privileges and others don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Lee is in no way a polemical writer, but the knowledge that informs <em>How I Became a North Korean</em> is hard-won. \u201cThe starting point for the novel was when North Koreans became part of my world,\u201d she says. \u201cI did whatever I could, and then I got threats, which changed everything.\u201d</p> <p>The threats came from an unlikely source \u2013 a Christian missionary, someone ostensibly involved in a good cause, setting up hideouts for defectors. Lee and the missionary were working together to help a refugee, but when, on a rare occasion, the man \u201cwas left alone with me, he got on his knees and begged me to get him out of the country,\u201d Lee recalls. \u201cHe said: \u2018You\u2019re different from the others.\u2019\u201d It turned out that the missionary wanted to keep him locked up in China, and \u2013 claiming a conversion \u2013 to use him to solicit donations.</p> <p>Lee had always assumed that \u201chuman rights and Christianity were on the same side in the border area, but it\u2019s often not the case\u201d. After she had acted alone in organising a way out for the refugee, the missionary began to call her. \u201cHe was furious, screaming at me, saying I wasn\u2019t going to get away with it. He was intent on revenge: I had stepped on his toes, his territory.\u201d Soon she began to receive calls from gangsters within South Korea, who knew where she lived. She was terrified, decamped to the US for months, and on returning to Seoul, moved house.</p> <p>She still sees the refugee regularly, and has now taken her own form of revenge. A central figure in <em>How I Became a North Korean</em> is Missionary Kwon, who appears to rescue the three fugitives, and installs them in a safe house. But they are effectively imprisoned, never see daylight, and are forced to memorise passages from the Bible. Kwon won\u2019t let them continue their journey until he believes their souls have been saved; his sadistic, exploitative nature is gradually revealed.</p> <p>Writers always return to their obsessions, Lee has said, and she counts religion \u2013 along with violence, power and inequality \u2013 among hers. In one of the stories in <em>Drifting House</em>, \u201cA Pastor\u2019s Son\u201d, the narrator\u2019s charismatic religious father abuses his new wife, pushing her head into a river. Another of the stories, \u201cThe Believer\u201d, which features murder, insanity and incest, begins: \u201cFor Jenny, G was always for God. God was there, God was everywhere.\u201d \u201cReligion has always been both something that\u2019s really close to me, and troubling to me,\u201d Lee has said; her father, I discover in talking to her, was both a violent man and a charismatic Christian pastor.</p> <p>\u201cI write fiction to get away from myself, only to learn that this is impossible,\u201d she has admitted. Lee completed first drafts of <em>Drifting House</em> fully believing she \u201cwasn\u2019t writing anything related to myself at all\u201d. As a PK (preacher\u2019s kid), she was \u201calways supposed to be good, and never to reveal anything \u2013 everything in my life was a secret\u201d. Only in revising them did she realise that \u201cthe stories are the most honest version of me\u201d. When we talk at her sister\u2019s house in a small city in California, two nervy dogs, one named Havoc, the other Mayhem, have been put outside, and spend much of the time desperate to get back in.</p> <p>The collection is eloquent on such subjects as the tearing apart of Korea by the cold war; the wrenching dislocation felt by emigrants; and the traditional, patriarchal Korean family. \u201cMy father was a God to me,\u201d she remembers. He \u201cwould say to me all the time: \u2018You are my property.\u2019\u201d Lee realises now that writing the stories was \u201cpartly an exercise in trying to understand\u201d her parents\u2019 generation: \u201cWhy were they the way they were? Why were so many people \u2013 us and those around us \u2013 so incredibly damaged?\u201d In \u201cThe Pastor\u2019s Son\u201d, the narrator begins to understand \u201cthe violence that my father had grown up with and passed down to us\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Living in a house where things were violent, you never knew what was going to happen, you were always afraid</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lee was four when her family moved from Korea to San Jose, California. At least she thinks so: \u201cMy parents\u2019 version of events is rather slippery.\u201d Her father had deserted from the harsh Korean Naval Academy, and claimed he had to leave the country because of his pro-democracy activities. He later said his phone had been tapped \u2013 which was common in the context of late 1970s and early 80s South Korea. Lee doesn\u2019t know whether that was genuinely the case, \u201cbut I believe his paranoia was real\u201d.</p> <p>Her father had a strong Christian faith: in South Korea the church has long been connected to progressive views and social aspiration. Under its auspices, he emigrated to the US to study religion, later spending all the money the family had to bring out his wife and two daughters to join him. They all shared one bedroom in a basement in a pastor\u2019s house, and spent the next decade moving every few years, always short of cash. They went to the US \u201cin search of a better life, but ended up failing rather spectacularly. I\u2019ve always been haunted by the spectre of that failure and its repercussions.\u201d</p> <p>Lee grew up \u201cintimate with violence\u201d and remembers those years vividly; the easier times since \u201cseem a little like a dream\u201d. Her father was \u201ca deeply troubled man, who hurt everybody around him\u201d. \u201cThe problem with living in a house where things were violent and unstable,\u201d she says, her fluency for a moment checked by emotion, \u201cis that you never knew what was going to happen, you were always afraid; always tense.\u201d Books were one vital way out. \u201cBoth my sister and I had a desire not to be us. Books meant becoming other people.

So much so that in Michoac\u00e1n, the state that produces most of the country\u2019s avocados and arguably the world\u2019s avocado capital, growers are ignoring the law and thinning out mature pine forest to plant young avocado trees instead.</p> <p>But what\u2019s so bad about swapping one type of tree for another? Permanent forest doesn\u2019t need to be sprayed with fertilisers and pesticides. It takes care of itself and acts as a vast carbon sink. Avocado plantations, on the other hand, need repeated cycles of chemical inputs. They drink up irrigation water too, lots of it, putting pressure on local water reserves. By <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/avocados-are-the-pits\" title=\"\">one estimate</a> it takes 272 litres just to grow about half a kilogram (two or three medium-sized) avocados.</p> <p>The thirsty avocado isn\u2019t just testing water levels in Mexico either. In California, avocados now vie with almonds as the <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2014/10/avocado-drought-chile-california\" title=\"\">top water-guzzling crop</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s a moot point whether the Mexicans who actually grow these on-trend fruits eventually harvest their fair share of the economic benefits. This lucrative trade is increasingly controlled by a <a href=\"http://www.vocativ.com/underworld/crime/avocado/\" title=\"\">drug cartel</a> known as the Caballeros Templarios (Knights Templar). So when you buy a Mexican avocado, a greedy share of revenue may well accrue to criminals.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I've seen fields of low-paid, often migrant workers who toil and live amid polluted water courses and pesticides</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You might think, OK, I\u2019ll buy avocados from some other less problematic source then. But would an avocado from Chile, Peru or the Dominican Republic automatically be more sustainable or equitably produced? The fact of the matter is that we know pitifully little about the environmental and working conditions of faceless people in faraway places who grow fruit for our tables, but I have seen enough of foreign fruit \u201cfarms\u201d to suspect the worst. Fields of abysmally low-paid, often migrant workers who toil and live day-in-day-out in a trashed environment amid polluted water courses and pesticides; the latter decaying workers\u2019 fingernails from dipping saplings into chemicals.</p> <p>In most of the fruit-growing countries of Latin America, if you talk back to the management, you can expect a knock at the door of your shanty. As Banana Link, the group that raises awareness of conditions in the global food industry, <a href=\"http://www.bananalink.org.uk/sitrabi-guatemala\" title=\"\">has documented</a>, Guatemala is the most dangerous. Any activist for fruit workers there courts summary dismissal or worse: kidnapping, torture, and murder.

This isn\u2019t an argument for boycotting imports of food that cannot be grown nearer us, but it is a powerful reason for refusing to fixate on them or fetishise them as the latest novelty \u201csuperfood\u201d.</p> <p>Whether it\u2019s Mexican avocados, or tinny-tasting, air-freighted Peruvian asparagus that has drastically depleted its local water table, these foods shouldn\u2019t be a staple of our diets \u2013 unless we still have the stomach for them when their often unedifying back story is made plain to us.</p> <p>For avocados, as for crops like pineapple and bananas, we can seek out a Fairtrade label, which guarantees producers\u2019 working conditions and remuneration better than most in their industry. Fairtrade pioneers Equal Exchange have established a <a href=\"http://equalexchange.coop/our-partners/farmer-partners/pragor\" title=\"\">partnership</a> with Pragor, a progressive&#xa0;group of small-scale avocado farmers in&#xa0;Michoac\u00e1n who each own an&#xa0;average of 10 acres of land, all 100% organic. When you buy a non-Fairtrade organic avocado, you can assume that neither workers nor the environment had to bear the omnipresent health and environmental burden of repeated pesticide spraying. Isolated from Fairtrade, organic standards in themselves do not guarantee a living wage, let alone freedom from company harassment for anyone who raises that topic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/vegan-corrupt-food-system-meat-dairy\">I\u2019ve converted to veganism to reduce my impact on the living world | George Monbiot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nutritionally speaking, what\u2019s an avocado got that you can\u2019t get elsewhere anyway?

It\u2019s democratically cheap, its nutritional benefits and locavore credentials are impeccable, and it\u2019s cultivated easily in the UK.</p> <p>But when we pick up a fashionable import like avocado, we need to be sure that it not only benefits our personal health and wellbeing, but also that of the communities that grow it.</p>",

Asylum politics is a wretched amoral swamp, a place where facts don\u2019t matter and hysteria regularly trumps reality.</p> <p>But if we get mired in our routine of this issue being seemingly hopeless and intractable, we can miss the small glimmers of hope, harbingers of movement. To see these, we have to look a little deeper.</p> <p>The first little pulse of hope this week came from the prime minister. Malcolm Turnbull didn\u2019t fire up the predictable asylum culture war hooey when asked about the Nauru files. He said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/nauru-files-widespread-condemnation-of-australian-government-by-un-and-others\">the government would review the incident reports</a> uncovered in this week\u2019s reports to see whether action had been taken. Not much, but not nothing either.</p> <p>The next came from the Liberal MP Russell Broadbent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/10/liberal-mp-russell-broadbent-appeals-to-people-of-conscience-after-release-of-nauru-files\">who poked his nose above the parapet</a> this week to observe that checks and balances matter, and it might be time to check whether the checks and balances were adequate to protect the safety of people in immigration detention.</p> <p>The intervention looks modest, but it isn\u2019t if you consider a couple of things: Broadbent doesn\u2019t chase ambulances, he intervenes when he means it. The Victorian moderate was also key in persuading John Howard to wind back the worst of his punitive immigration regime during the last period of Coalition government \u2013 and Broadbent is evidently galvanised sufficiently to put his view on the record at a moment when the Liberal party is awash with tribalism, pugilism, internal contention and mulish retribution.</p> <p>Then we can look to Labor. We know that Labor has been obsessed with \u201cme tooism\u201d on asylum policy in a desperate bid to avoid the apparently unbearable inconvenience of a Daily Telegraph smash up and a Ray Hadley tantrum about their collective lack of manhood when it comes to repelling the hordes plotting a comfortable sea path to Australia before reclining on a life of welfare.</p> <p>But a couple of things happened this week. The new opposition spokesman on immigration, Shayne Neumann, was very quick out of the blocks after the Nauru files were published, signalling a private member\u2019s bill to improve reporting on Nauru, and making the case for a children\u2019s advocate. Internally, the speed of the response was noted, a slight change of intention and emphasis.</p> <p>In addition to that signal, various caucus members were quick to send their own twofold message: the revelations from the Nauru files were completely and utterly abhorrent; and Labor\u2019s internal debate over the right policy balance between hardline deterrence and human rights was not over.</p> <p>This is interesting too, because post-election, we (and Bill Shorten) might have expected the boats issue to settle placidly in Labor after the departure of two serial campaigners for change, Melissa Parke and Anna Burke. Not by the looks of things. The caucus disquiet about Labor\u2019s positioning will persist into this new parliament. You can set your watch by that prediction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gallery/2016/aug/10/twelve-of-the-most-harrowing-accounts-from-the-nauru-files-in-pictures\">Twelve of the most harrowing accounts from the Nauru files \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then we can look at the new crossbench. There has been a lot of analysis in recent times about the new forces of populism and protectionism and xenophobia that are manifest in the new 45th parliament, which is both true, and a big deal, and a cliche that risks overshadowing a more complex reality.</p> <p>Yes, those forces are part of this next term. But there are also people now in the parliament who will stand up against the abuse of children, wherever they happen to be.</p> <p>Late this week I undertook a quick test of parliamentary support for Labor\u2019s proposed private member\u2019s bill to see where the numbers might lie, and I also wanted to test the resting disposition of some of the new kingmakers to the revelations about Nauru published this week.</p> <p>I learned a couple of things in this sortie. I think if Labor brought on its bill in the Senate, and if it brought forward a proposal for a children\u2019s advocate for kids on Nauru, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/nauru-files-labor-optimistic-about-strengthening-rules-on-reporting-abuse-of-refugees\">it is very likely to get support in the upper house</a>.</p> <p>A quick out take from my conversations. The Greens are a yes, because they are diligent and tireless on this issue. Nick Xenophon was disturbed by the Guardian\u2019s reports, and was positive in principle. Derryn Hinch said the Nauru papers \u201cwere awful reading\u201d and he thought the Coalition had a tendency to shoot the messenger when it came to offshore detention, so he\u2019s interested in having a look at what can be done, and Jacqui Lambie said she\u2019d look positively at what Labor brought forward.</p> <p>That\u2019s a majority, at least in-principle, right off the bat. An incremental improvement for sure, but on this issue, sensible people take what they can get. There would be sympathy too, in the House \u2013 probably not a majority, but certainly sympathy.</p> <p>Take the independent MP Cathy McGowan, who has bucked conventional wisdom by taking a public stand on human rights despite representing a deeply conservative rural electorate. Conservative opponents ran hard against McGowan in the recent election for siding with the Greens on immigration matters, and it resonated, it was a big issue locally, but, interestingly, the community stuck with her.</p> <p>McGowan worked quietly in the last parliament with a cross-party group, which included a couple of Liberals, Labor people and the Greens, to get children out of detention. This quiet lobbying effort came at the behest of the combined heads of congregations, and a group of Catholic nuns, who are very active behind the scenes trying to persuade the parliament of Australia to protect the human rights of vulnerable people. They didn\u2019t advertise the effort and make it a confrontation, they just looked for solutions.</p> <p>The modest outbreak of empathy suggests the new parliament could (and I wouldn\u2019t rate it higher than could) give rise to another cross-party effort to come up with a solution to a deeply vexed problem. We saw this happen in the 43rd minority parliament.</p> <p>This would be superficially promising, but the recent past tells us such enterprises tend to collapse under their own disparate weight. Parliamentarians see different facts, and intuit different solutions, so the common ground tends to get hollowed out when people attempt to forge an agreed multi-partisan position.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/10/former-save-the-children-workers-say-nauru-files-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg\">Former Save the Children workers say Nauru files 'just the tip of the iceberg'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And then you only have to contemplate a well-meaning group of MPs meeting the immovable object that is Peter Dutton, and the former immigration minister, Scott Morrison, and you see the fruitlessness of the exercise.</p> <p>If change is going to happen, we need the following conditions.</p> <p>There has to be a clear tipping point. Broadbent here is a good barometer, given he was a key part of the civilising forces on the old Howard policy. If he\u2019s putting his head up, that suggests an experienced parliamentary hand thinks the tipping point is now close.</p> <p>I can imagine it being close if I just think for a moment of a Don Dale-style video emerging cataloguing some horror on Nauru. I don\u2019t want to put my mind there, or yours, but I suspect you can imagine various scenarios that would be more compelling and cut-through than the Dutton talking points.</p> <p>There has to be consistent pressure from outside the parliament, and I don\u2019t mean abstract intermittent pressure from well meaning advocates: I mean a campaign. From churches, who remain very powerful in politics, from community groups, in marginal seats. If it\u2019s organised, consistent, broadly based and targeted, that will capture the attention of parliamentarians in very short order.</p> <p>Media organisations dedicated to serving the public interest and speaking truth to power also have to double down on this story. We need to keep pushing, delving, unearthing factual examples that can\u2019t be lightly dismissed, and reporters have to be given time to investigate, which is possibly the greatest luxury going in an era of cash-strapped organisations and shrinking newsrooms.</p> <p>If the prime minister wants to do more than review incident reports, if he wants to actually intervene to clean up a diabolical system being perpetrated in our name, then he has to follow the template set by the man Turnbull has recently taken to calling his mentor: John Howard.</p> <p>When Howard eventually resolved the government had to move, he didn\u2019t just issue an abstract instruction and leave it to his portfolio minister. He got his department head, Peter Shergold, to set up an interdepartmental taskforce to delve into the facts of what was going on in detention, and develop a pathway to concrete action.</p> <p>Leadership is more than saying abstractly you would like something looked at. You have to activate all the tools of the office of prime minister, otherwise the studied inertia of opponents to change means nothing happens.</p> <p>Turnbull faces rolling challenges to his authority, but the prime minister remains capable of action. He didn\u2019t wait for permission when it came to juvenile justice in the Northern Territory. He can stand up for what is right, and given his current position, standing up for what is right is better than constant conciliation and compromise, which thus far has bought him nothing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/10/gillian-triggs-says-onus-on-australian-public-to-change-detention-policy-after-nauru-files-leak\">Gillian Triggs says public pressure can change detention policy after Nauru files leak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As well as authority, and process, there also needs to be clarity about what is actually wrong here, otherwise all kinds of temporary solutions can be produced by politicians that are designed to lull and soothe the conscience of the voting public rather than actually materially benefit people who are, beyond any reasonable doubt, being systemically abused.</p> <p>Here are the first principles.</p> <p>Australia has every right to defend the integrity of its borders. In an era of acute globalisation fatigue, where sovereignty is now a potent part of domestic political discussion around the world, any national government has to try to counter the retrograde forces of racism and xenophobia with reassuring messaging about border security. But there\u2019s a choice about how you do this.</p> <p>Turnbull has shown you can turn around a whole potent political discussion by replacing apocalyptic dog whistling with rational, proportionate discussion. He\u2019s done it on national security. If so inclined, he can do it on asylum as well. We could, for a start, stop talking about this issue as if punitive policy is the only way we can stop people drowning at sea. False binaries just feed the cycle of irrationality, and rational discussion could even presage rational action, you never know.</p> <p>But it isn\u2019t just about what we are saying. We do need to be very clear-eyed about the problem the Australian parliament needs to address. The deep problem here is one of substance.</p> <p>Right now, a liberal democracy, Australia \u2013 a country we all love and are proud to call our home \u2013 is holding a group of people, indefinitely, in offshore immigration detention.</p> <p>These people have not committed any crime. Some of the people are children.</p> <p>The people being detained offshore at Australia\u2019s behest, essentially because of an outbreak of irrationality and extreme cynicism in Australia\u2019s political system, are not safe. They are being harmed, and in a state of contagion and despair, they are harming themselves. The evidence for this is overwhelming.</p> <p>I make only one request of readers this weekend. Find some time to focus on what we actually are doing in our offshore detention policy. The enormity of what we are doing can be captured with this simple observation: when it comes to indefinite detention, we are treating people on Nauru, people who have fled persecution, more punitively than criminals, more harshly than murderers and rapists. Criminals have a release date, people detained on Nauru do not.</p> <p>It\u2019s unconscionable, and we have to own it, because owning our collective travesty without rationalisations and weasel words is the first step towards having the moral clarity to change it.</p>",

  "<p>An email from a member landed in my inbox in early June.</p> <p>\u201cI have been a huge supporter of the Guardian but am finding that you cover stories that are almost always about negative and/or fearful things,\u201d she said. \u201cCan you not at least have a good news section? As soon as I see a change I would love to come back.\u201d</p> <p>As luck (or good management? No, definitely luck) would have it the special projects team that I run at the Guardian had just created a \u201cgood news section\u201d a few days earlier. We had felt that for too long people were not getting a fair reflection of all the constructive things going on in the world from traditional news media which clings to the old adage: \u201cIf it bleeds it leads.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Industry wisdom suggests readers share positive stories more readily, and that has certainly been the case</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since it launched on 1 June, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/half-full-solutions-innovations-answers\">Half full series </a>has published 29 pieces, attracting more than 1m page views and, more importantly, tens of thousands of social media shares. These are good, though not game-changing numbers. Industry wisdom suggests readers share positive stories more readily, and that has certainly been the case with some \u2013 though not all \u2013 of our pieces. Readers and members have also suggested dozens of ideas for us to pursue, from community efforts to tackle mental health to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/modern-life-rubbish-helping-mumbai-clean-up-beach-india-city\">global moves to pick up litter</a>. </p> <p>We should stress this is not about \u201cgood news\u201d. Constructive journalism aims to focus on innovation, initiative and inspiring people trying to make a difference. It can be found in the darkest tragedies \u2013 the hero reconnecting families after the earthquake, or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/09/whats-in-it-for-them-the-volunteers-saving-europes-refugees\">volunteers reaching out to refugees</a> at their time of need. Sometimes it can focus on controversial things: initiatives to introduce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/state-handouts-for-all-europe-set-to-pilot-universal-basic-incomes\">a universal basic income</a>, for example, or an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/26/homeless-shelter-ottawa-gives-wine-to-alcoholics\">alcohol rehab programme</a> that offers addicts ... alcohol. </p> <p>I must admit, not everyone at the Guardian thought Half full was a good idea. We had a lively exchange of views before taking the plunge. Several people warned it might create an open door for PR spinmeisters and puff merchants to peddle their saccharine message about products, services or aimless publicity antics. We would have to be astute to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/23/churnalism-pr-media-trust\">avoid becoming just another channel for churnalism</a>.<br></p> <p>But the events of this summer have convinced me that neglecting the constructive stories carries its own dangers. Because the British media failed for 20 years to show the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/europe/reciprocal-benefits/\">constructive, positive achievements of the EU</a>, it was all too easy for detractors to dominate the game, contributing to the Brexit referendum vote on 23 June. </p> <p>The same is true of global conflict. Because the \u201conly story in town\u201d in Jerusalem involves the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians, we have become accustomed to reading about never-ending confrontation and violence. It has become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Media reflects society, but also shapes it. Yet when we asked a journalist in the region to find examples of Israelis, Palestinians and Israeli Arabs working side by side, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/11/israel-jews-arabs-palestinians-work-together-peace\">we were spoiled for choice</a>. Conflict is only half the story.</p> <p>That\u2019s certainly the case with Africa. Stories of corruption, brutality and bad governance have become a lazy trope, rotating on a wretched merry-go-round of doom, confirming all our worst prejudices. Of course, serious news events like those that beset South Sudan and Central African Republic belong at the heart of our coverage. But we need to fight the stereotype that every African is a victim, a migrant or desperate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/26/code-club-senegal-where-women-lead-the-way\">because clearly they are not</a>. </p> <p>In my view, it\u2019s critical that we cover the Europe refugee crisis with the same approach. It is clear that in the months ahead there may well be more attacks on civilians. The clamour to search for the refugee connection will be great (even though virtually none of this summer\u2019s terrorist attacks were perpetrated by recent arrivals in Europe). We have to show that most refugees bring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/from-the-cold-war-to-syria-seven-decades-of-refugee-stories-in-britain\">far more benefits than drawbacks</a>. Of course, a few will be bad people. But if we don\u2019t focus on the good as well, we risk contributing to some people\u2019s assumption that refugees are a threat.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Constructive journalism is a way to keep audiences tuning in, curious, and ready to take the good with the bad</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is also the case that some of these violent attacks will be perpetrated by people with mental illness. We have to fight generalisations here too: the vast majority of people with mental illness are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/14/truth-about-depression\">capable, gentle individuals</a> requiring our support, not our opprobrium. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/29/from-ketamine-to-cupboard-therapy-the-future-of-mental-health-treatment\">There are solutions out there for them too</a>.</p> <p>There\u2019s a feedback loop at play here too. Increased coverage of positive news stories can also benefit the mental health of the audience, as Southampton Business School\u2019s <a href=\"http://theconversation.com%20[http//theconversation.com/shock-horror-behind-the-ethics-and-evolution-of-the-bad-news-business-39211\">Denise Baden writes</a>. \u201cOur brains are not adapted to process the whole of the world\u2019s horrors, selected and framed to present the most shocking and horrifying picture of the world. It is no wonder then that many try to turn off and those that do engage with it experience anxiety, worry and depression.\u201d</p> <p>Baden\u2019s research and the results of more than 2,000 responses to her surveys, suggest that the negative presentation of news leads to \u201cdisengagement, avoidance, negative mood and anxiety\u201d.

That many of the magazine\u2019s petrolhead audience likely to be the programme\u2019s most die-hard fans, makes it even more likely the change of lineup turned some people off the brand entirely.</p> <p>Will Arianna Huffington\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/11/arianna-huffington-to-leave-huffington-post-thrive\">departure from the Huffington Post</a> have a similar impact? Even though the original web newspaper (or at least the first successful one) shares her name, the answer is likely no. HuffPo produces a diverse range of writing, and has a much more diffuse audience and way of reaching them. Yet there\u2019s still a sense that her exit is the end of an era for the publication, that it will have to find a new driving force.</p> <p>There are few sectors that so regularly build businesses around public personas \u2013 except perhaps the tech industry \u2013 and while it has helped create some influential and successful businesses, moving on to the next stage often proves difficult.</p>

  "<p>John Osborne\u2019s <em>The Entertainer</em> is back, bang on cue: a play in which the nation frets about immigration (\u201cBloody Irish! Bloody Poles!\u201d cries one character) and our uncertain place in the world (\u201cPeople seem to be able to do what they like to us\u201d). What kind of a country is Britain, the play asks, what is to become of us?</p> <p>A new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/09/kenneth-branagh-rob-brydon-entertainer-garrick-theatre-ken-dodd\">Kenneth Branagh</a> production opens next week, nearly 60 years after its first appearance in 1957. Back then, the Suez crisis had administered a shock to the national psyche that would not be equalled until Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Rarely had a theatrical work been so eagerly anticipated. <em>Look Back in Anger</em> had strutted on stage at the Royal Court the previous year and declared war, not only on the establishment but on the British theatre. The French windows of the standard West End play were unceremoniously kicked in as gobby, snarky, grand-standing Jimmy Porter took centre stage to tell it like it was. Battle lines were drawn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/09/kenneth-branagh-rob-brydon-entertainer-garrick-theatre-ken-dodd\">Kenneth Branagh on The Entertainer: 'I've been bending Rob Brydon's ear about standup'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The controversy was helpful to sales. As Osborne himself so succinctly put it, the theatre is a minority art with a majority influence: the very existence of Jimmy holding forth with furious eloquence created a stir out of all proportion to the number of people who had actually seen the play. Among those who took the trouble to do so was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/olivier\">Laurence Olivier</a>, ever on the <em>qui vive</em> for something new. He was not impressed: \u201cIt\u2019s just a travesty on England,\u201d he told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/miller\">Arthur Miller</a>, whose wife, Marilyn Monroe, he was directing in <em>The Prince and the Showgirl</em>, \u201ca lot of bitter rattling on about conditions.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the rest of the theatre world was waiting to see what Osborne would write next. He was quietly developing the idea for a play in which the music hall would become a metaphor for the nation: the decline and fall of the Holborn Empire would mirror the decline and fall of the British empire. \u201cThe music hall is dying,\u201d he wrote in his author\u2019s note to the published text, \u201cand, with it, a significant part of England. Some of the heart of England has gone; something that once belonged to everyone, for this was truly a folk art.\u201d</p> <p>The play is set in one of the coastal towns that Osborne knew so well from his rep days \u2013 he wrote <em>Look Back in Anger</em> in Morecambe \u2013 and featured a warring and unhappy family whose breadwinner, the drama\u2019s central character, is a third-rate comedian, Archie Rice. At one time a star, Archie\u2019s old dad, Billy, gives voice to the playwright\u2019s aching sense of Britain\u2019s decline. Though Osborne aligned himself with the leftwing causes of his contemporaries at the Court, he was deeply, romantically, almost aggressively nostalgic for a time when life was better, when people like him felt normal and in the right. \u201cI feel sorry for you people,\u201d Billy tells his grandson. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s really like. You haven\u2019t lived, most of you. You\u2019ve never known what it was like, you\u2019re all miserable really.\u201d The representatives of the younger generation, Archie\u2019s son and daughter, angrily fight Jimmy Porter\u2019s corner, if in muted form. But Archie himself is possessed neither by nostalgia nor anger: he is and knows himself to be clapped-out, shifty, empty. \u201cWhat do I care?\u201d he sings as part of the tacky routine he performs, knowing even as he goes through the motions that the game is up and there is no place for him in the modern world. But what else can he do? The show must go on, even if no one is there to see it. The idea for Archie came to Osborne watching a comic ramping up a mediocre impression of Charles Laughton as the hunchback of Notre-Dame one afternoon at the crumbling Chelsea Palace of Varieties in London. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of heroic, suicidal nobility,\u201d he wrote, \u201cin a bad comic who goes onstage to face certain derision.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e1d03db1d85093ecc10f4c32aabfd1791e73bfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e1d03db1d85093ecc10f4c32aabfd1791e73bfd/0_0_3000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olivier as Archie Rice in the 1960 film adaptation of The Entertainer, directed by Tony Richardson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivier as Archie Rice in the 1960 film adaptation of The Entertainer, directed by Tony Richardson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Silver Screen Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Osborne had written just about half the play when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/miller\">Miller</a> took himself, his wife and a deeply resistant Olivier to see <em>Look Back in Anger</em>. Miller was fascinated by the play. Olivier still didn\u2019t get it, second time around, so Miller was astonished to hear him say to the young author when they went backstage: \u201cEr, you\u2019re not writing anything that might have the littlest opportunity for \u2026 well \u2026 me \u2026 are you?\u201d Osborne showed Olivier the first act of <em>The Entertainer</em>. He was immediately drawn to the part, not of Archie, but of Billy, whose sentiments he shared. He swiftly changed his mind. For some while he had been looking for a way to reinvent himself: how better to smash the image of the classical actor and ageing romantic lead than by crooning and hoofing and telling off-colour jokes? He desperately wanted to be part of the latest thing, whatever it was, and if doing so meant he could steal a march on his peers \u2013 the Gielguds and the Richardsons and the Guinnesses \u2013 then so much the better. What didn\u2019t seem to interest Olivier too much was what the play was actually saying. He himself was unthinkingly conservative, God-fearing, law-abiding and patriotic. He objected to certain anti-monarchy lines, which he had cut when the play transferred to the West End, but it seems he saw it not as a state-of-England play, but as the personal tragedy of Archie Rice, with which he identified strongly. There was something of Archie in him, he told the Daily Mail. \u201cIt\u2019s what I might so easily have become.\u201d Standing in front of the footlights in his mask-like makeup at a technical rehearsal, he said to William Gaskill: \u201cIt\u2019s me, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s me.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Olivier\u2019s Archie presented mid-century Britain to itself in all its tarnished, seedy, impotent dishonesty</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The production was exceptionally well cast, with due deference to the star. Billy Rice was played by George Relph, an old chum of Olivier\u2019s, a very young Richard Pasco played Archie\u2019s son, Frank, and Dorothy Tutin (Olivier\u2019s lover at the time), was cast as his daughter Jean. The Royal Court management was keen that Phoebe, Archie\u2019s neglected and rather plain wife, should be played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/vivien-leigh\">Vivien Leigh</a>, Olivier\u2019s demanding and very beautiful wife in real life; she was at the time battling with bipolar disorder. Olivier swiftly scotched the idea, even in the face of a suggestion that she could wear a rubber mask to disguise her beauty. Brenda de Banzie, who had earlier played opposite Olivier in <em>Venus Observed</em>, was duly cast in the part, but Leigh sat in on rehearsals until the unending stream of helpful comments emanating from her began to be distracting, at which she was removed. Tony Richardson, George Devine\u2019s associate at the Court, whose instincts for what would be successful were somewhat in advance of his gifts as a director, presided over all this. He staged the sprawling play efficiently enough, though he was not always able to help Osborne reconcile the opposing demands of rhetoric and form in the play, any more than he had been in <em>Look Back in Anger</em>. It was a good show, however, with witty and accurate designs by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/nov/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1\">Alan Tagg</a> and a brilliant pastiche score by John Addison. In <em>Look Back in Anger</em> jazz is the defining music, but in <em>The Entertainer</em> it is the blues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86f751e6159018f2d0a8edc9de2a6ad8d89d3151\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86f751e6159018f2d0a8edc9de2a6ad8d89d3151/0_0_1181_952/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Max Wall and Sue Johns in the 1974 Greenwich theatre revival of The Entertainer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"806\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Max Wall and Sue Johns in the 1974 Greenwich theatre revival of The Entertainer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Johns/taken from picture library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first night was unusually fraught; Osborne had been in the law courts all day, divorcing his first wife. Olivier had written to him to thank him for giving him such a wonderful part, and hoped that he didn\u2019t \u201cfuck it up for him\u201d. On the contrary: he gave what many people felt was the performance of his life. It is not given to many actors to embody the zeitgeist: Olivier\u2019s Archie presented post-Suez, mid-century Britain to itself in all its tarnished, seedy, impotent dishonesty, surgically exposing all the pain that lay behind it. He spoke for England, as he had done before, when he had played Henry V on stage. Laughton had gone backstage and asked him: \u201cYou know why you\u2019re so good in this, Larry? Do you? It\u2019s because you are England.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/29/for-baby-boomers-the-1950s-were-years-of-hope\">For baby boomers, the 1950s were years of hope | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The reviews were fairly unanimous about the quality of Olivier\u2019s performance; the combination of tacky brilliance in the front cloth numbers (fruit of his close observation of comedians such as Max Miller and his hero Sid Field) and emotional nakedness in the domestic scenes was overwhelming. The play itself was less warmly received: \u201cMr Osborne has had the big and brilliant idea of putting the whole of contemporary England on one and the same stage,\u201d wrote Kenneth Tynan, \u201che has bitten off, in this broad new subject, rather more than he can maul.\u201d He added, the author seemed unable to write convincing parts for women: Jean was \u201cvaguely anti-Queen and goes in for loose generalities like \u2018We\u2019ve only got ourselves\u2019; beyond that, nada. Rather than commit himself, Mr Osborne has watered the girl down to a nullity.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Max Wall\u2019s Archie revealed the romanticism of Olivier\u2019s approach: he drew a tragicomic portrait of a soul in hell</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Great part, mediocre play: this has, with variations, remained the verdict of history. Interestingly, only two years after Tynan\u2019s influential first review he saw a production of it in Hamburg, and revised his opinion: the great actor Martin Held played Archie quite differently from Olivier, as a German cabaret MC, \u201ccruder and sweatier than Olivier, and drunker, too, in a stiff-backed, stolid way, emphasising his jokes with a ghastly, crowing laugh\u201d. The result, wrote Tynan, was that the play took on much more cogency and shape; Jean became a central figure. Such thorough-going reconsiderations of the drama have been rare; only one British actor in living memory has effaced the imprint of Olivier, and that was the great comedian (and novelty dancer) Max Wall, who played Archie in Osborne\u2019s own perhaps over-loving 1974 revival at Greenwich theatre (it lasted nearly four hours).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/nov/05/theatre\">The Entertainer, London, November 1974</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As if in a negative image, Wall reversed Olivier\u2019s conception. In the front cloth scenes, Olivier showed a 10\u2011rate performer who, despite a lack of talent, was eager to make an impact. In the private scenes, he exposed the man\u2019s despair: when he showed Jean his dead eyes, they were in fact shot through with excruciating pain. When Wall played the same scene, his eyes were unnervingly dead; during the scenes in the music hall, he presented Archie as effortlessly skilful but deeply bored, just sketching it in. He nonchalantly knocked off a few steps, full of contempt for his audience, whereas Olivier put everything he had into the dancing. Wall\u2019s performance revealed the full-blown romanticism of Olivier\u2019s approach: he drew a tragicomic portrait of a soul in hell. Wall\u2019s Archie was flatly realistic, and all the more disturbing for that. The man was a dead cinder. The performance made the play seem smaller, less epic, but in some ways better, more real, less schematic. It was less entertaining, and more disturbing.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0roY4u3AFAQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0roY4u3AFAQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch a scene from the 1960 film adaptation of The Entertainer </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Such are the swings and roundabouts of theatrical production: just as Edith Evans by sheer force of talent made Lady Bracknell the focal point of <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em>, unbalancing it, Olivier\u2019s Archie to some extent overwhelmed <em>The Entertainer</em>. But who would have been without that performance? Olivier was remade, and moved on to ever greater heights. Nothing in Osborne\u2019s subsequent work ever made quite such an impact, but, as he wrote to Devine: \u201cI shall go on writing plays and play my part in all the things that need so desperately to be done.

That\u2019s a mildly scary though for Andy Murray, who is up next and two wins away from the final - where his old Spanish pal could well be waiting for him. Nadal, who won gold in Beijing, missed London - and almost missed Rio. The whippy left wrist that has been is six-gun all his career finally ran out of bullets at Roland Garros nearly 10 weeks ago, and not many expected him to make this gig. He led Spain in at the opening ceremony and who could doubt his commitment to the cause after entering the three disciplines? Unfortunately, the wretched intrusion of rain on Wednesday has forced fixtures pile-up that demands he play three matches on Thursday. He got the first out of the way with a bit of a struggle, taking just over two hours to get rid of the always combative Frenchman, Gilles Simon. The wrist looked strong.

After interminably refreshing the Olympic tickets page, I managed to get some early morning hockey tickets - with the added bonus of being able to stay in the Olympic Park for the full Saturday watching on the big screens. I also booked an evening slot to go up the Orbit tower, as a fun way to round off the day. I was totally unaware that you can see down into the stadium from the viewing platform, or that our slot coincided with Mo Farah going for gold. Only half the track was visible from where we were, so as the athletes disappeared down the back straight every lap we could only listen to the incredible noise coming from the stadium and cross our fingers! Even from several hundred metres away, the sound was thunderous. I can\u2019t imagine the atmosphere inside the stadium, but it was quite a special shared experience between the handful of us crowded onto that platform, as Mo came into view and stormed down the home straight to victory.\u201d</p> <p>For mine? I blagged into the photographers area - i.e. the best seats in the house. Then did it again for the 100m final a couple nights later. Probably would have been punted from my then-LOCOG job if caught.

  "<p>If, just 800 generations ago, we took a summer holiday to Crete, Cyprus or Malta, we would have found familiar-looking islands, filled with the flowers and birds we can enjoy today. But bursting through the scrub would\u2019ve been one surprise: a pygmy elephant, one metre high, one of many different elephant species that once roamed every continent apart from Australia and Antarctica.</p> <p>The 20,000-year-old pygmy elephants of the Mediterranean islands may appear as fantastical as the woolly mammoths which still ambled across one Alaskan island just 5,600 years ago. But these animals\u2019 lives, and deaths, take on a new pertinence today. They lived a blink of an eye ago in evolutionary time and shared the planet with modern humans. And the fate of these lost elephants, warns <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/staff-directory/adrian-lister.html\">Prof Adrian Lister</a>, paleobiologist at the Natural History Museum, is analogous to the troubled future facing their close relatives, the African and Asian elephants threatened with obliteration today.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are more likely to drive things to extinction on islands than on the mainland,\u201d says Lister. \u201cOne of the problems with living elephants is not just that their numbers are going down and down but that their populations are very fragmented. We call it islandisation. National parks are islands today. If you\u2019re a population of 50 elephants on a national park in Nepal, surrounded by agricultural land, you may as well be on an oceanic island in terms of population size and genetic diversity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7031b0f015c67f59e806e997ea33d6a758dbe8e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7031b0f015c67f59e806e997ea33d6a758dbe8e8/834_676_3076_2110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Platybelodon grangeri were shovel-tusked elephants that lived in China 15 to 11 million years ago.

The seven-million-year-old tracks of 13 four-tusked elephants, <em>Stegotetrabelodon syrticus</em>, <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2012/02/in-the-steps-of-ancient-elephants/\">were uncovered in the deserts</a> of the United Arab Emirates.

But it wasn\u2019t just <em>Homo sapiens</em>: most pygmy elephants disappeared from Mediterranean islands before any evidence of human occupation and woolly mammoths in far North America disappeared before people turned up. This month, <a href=\"http://news.psu.edu/story/419291/2016/08/01/research/st-paul-island-mammoths-most-accurately-dated-prehistoric\">new research</a> precisely dates the disappearance of woolly mammoth from St Paul\u2019s Island, Alaska, at 5,600 years ago.

Why didn\u2019t all the elephants go at the same time like the dinosaurs did 66 million years ago? It wasn\u2019t so much that climate change caused extinction as caused population collapses. Climate change kind of beat the crap out of these elephants. Finally humans showed up and wiped out whatever remained. I don\u2019t personally believe that humans can have been responsible at all times and neither could the climate.\u201d</p> <p>Today\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.edgeofexistence.org/mammals/species_info.php?id=12 \">Asian elephant</a> can be regarded as the oldest of the surviving <em>Proboscideans</em>, originating in Africa before the African elephant. \u201cYou could call it the original African elephant,\u201d laughs Vivek Menon, chair of the <a href=\"http://www.asesg.org/ \">Asian Elephant Specialist Group</a>. Across the world, and not just in Asia and Africa, elephants are celebrated in culture, a staple of stories for children, a rich and mighty symbol. Even scientists don\u2019t always object to our relentless anthropomorphism of these global citizens. \u201cThe elephant is a near person,\u201d says Menon. \u201cIts compassion, its memory \u2013 this is a remarkably intelligent beast. As a scientist, I know that elephants come very, very close to us.\u201d</p> <p>What is less widely recognised in modern-day elephants is their talent for engineering or reshaping landscapes.

Just like their ancestors, African elephants <a href=\"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/4/e1400103.full\">disperse large quantities of seed over long distances</a>: in Congo, scientists found forest elephants disperse 345 seeds per day from 96 species, typically more than 1km from parent trees. They convert forest to scrub, damaging trees and opening up areas to smaller herbivores or sun-loving lizards, which has also been shown to help lions catch prey. Elephants\u2019 browsing of plants can reduce the fuel loads and the intensity of wildfires. Their defecation returns nutrients to the soil more quickly than seasonal leaf loss and decay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/african-zip/giv-31075WSwAfLYQv9GT\" data-alt=\"African elephant range map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/african-zip/giv-31075WSwAfLYQv9GT\">African elephant range map</a> </figure>  <p>Being forced into smaller \u201cislands\u201d of protected land has caused elephants to damage some African woodlands. A decade ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/feb/26/environment \">there was fierce debate</a> in South Africa over restarting \u201cconservation\u201d culls to save forest habitat. <a href=\"https://www.wildcru.org/members/dr-christopher-okane/\">Zoologist Dr Christopher O\u2019Kane</a>, fellow of Worcester College, Oxford, compared the browsing impact of elephants and impala and found that the long-term impact of a reasonable density of impala had a similar impact to a reasonable density elephants \u2013 culling impala could save as much woodland as culling elephants. \u201cWe don\u2019t really need to cull elephants and no one is going to do it for the foreseeable future but it may rear its head again,\u201d says O\u2019Kane. \u201cIn a perfect world, the African elephant needs a lot more space than it has.\u201d</p> <p>There are big differences between elephant species but also big cultural differences in how they are viewed. In Asia there is a long tradition of taking Asian elephants into captivity and training them. The elephant-headed Hindu god Ganesh is, appropriately enough, a remover of obstacles. Elephants are prayed to every day. \u201cIt is extraordinarily helpful that our grandmothers taught us to revere the elephant,\u201d says Menon. Despite elephants killing more than 400 people in India every year \u2013 \u201cthis is not badgers we\u2019re talking about,\u201d says Menon \u2013 here there are no suggestions it should be culled. The biggest challenge in conserving the Asian elephant? \u201cLand \u2013 nothing else,\u201d says Menon. \u201cAs Mark Twain said, \u2018buy land, they are not making it anymore\u2019.

In 2015, 5,633 Nigerian women and girls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/07/nigeria-trafficking-women-prostitutes-italy\">arrived in Italy</a>, an almost fourfold increase on the number that arrived in 2014. The numbers have increased again this year. The International Organisation for Migration believes that close to 80% of these women and girls are trafficking victims who criminals plan to exploit in brothels across Europe.</p> <p>Many will have already suffered violence during the dangerous journey from Nigeria and across the Sahara. There are numerous accounts of women being raped in \u201cconnection houses\u201d in Libya, kept in prison-like conditions while they wait to be crammed on to boats to make the perilous voyage across the Mediterranean.</p> <p>A large number of these victims are likely to end up being exploited in the UK.

In addition, more thought must be devoted to tackling the European demand that partly fuels the trade.</p> <p>But most crucial of all is increased emphasis on strategic prevention at source, the absence of which has enabled the trade to boom over recent years.</p> <p>Prevention activity focused on Edo state, as Nigeria\u2019s key trafficking hub, must be a core focus of the government\u2019s new fund. I have visited the region on several occasions. Local leaders want to tackle the problem. <a href=\"http://www.uniben.edu/\">Academics</a> there have also completed work looking at the causes of the trafficking trade and protective factors that are likely to be effective.</p> <p>This work, combined with engagement with community leaders, faith groups, NGOs and government agencies, reveals three aspects of prevention on which the government should focus.</p> <p>The first is to work with local communities in an effort to challenge attitudes that have normalised payments to facilitators to transport young people into Europe. The focus here should be on communicating the realities of the trafficking experience. </p> <p>I met a mother in Edo who told me her eldest son was murdered by traffickers in Libya. She then had to sell all of her possessions to secure the release of her younger son. Her one wish was for others to know about the true dangers of the journey, in order to prevent more mothers experiencing such heartbreak.</p> <p>The second aspect is to work with <a href=\"http://www.naptip.gov.ng/\">Nigeria\u2019s anti-trafficking agency</a>, building their capacity to crack down on traffickers operating in Edo. These criminals often act with impunity, especially in remote rural regions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/07/nigeria-trafficking-women-prostitutes-italy\">Trafficked to Turin: the Nigerian women forced to work as prostitutes in Italy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Communities in Edo must also be supported to provide opportunities for young people that protect them from being enticed by traffickers. The third recommendation is therefore to work with the Nigerian government and businesses to identify and promote sustainable livelihood development that reduces vulnerability to trafficking.</p> <p>Anti-slavery prevention is smart development policy. Slavery is an impediment to development, and this is certainly the case in Edo, where trafficking has robbed communities of young people who could contribute most to local development.</p> <p>Effective prevention will always be the best long-term strategy, as it stops people from becoming victims in the first place. It is a smart investment for the UK. In 2013, human trafficking for sexual exploitation was <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-organised-crime-estimating-the-scale-and-the-social-and-economic-costs\">estimated to cost the UK at least \u00a3890m</a>. Yes, working in Nigeria has it challenges, and of course there must be rigorous due diligence on use of UK funds. But this issue is simply too urgent to ignore.</p> <p>Failure to act will mean that thousands more victims are created, and Europe and the UK will be left to deal with the consequences. Addressing the root causes of the trafficking trade is the key to ending this decades old cycle of suffering.</p> <ul> <li><em>Kevin Hyland is the UK\u2019s first independent anti-slavery commissioner.

Here\u2019s how they stack up.</p> <h2><strong>What\u2019s contained in the Nauru files and the accuracy of the reports</strong></h2> <p>Peter Dutton said: <em>There are some that are legitimate and there are others that aren\u2019t and others that have been found not to be substantiated. I think it is important to recognise of the 2,000 reports many could include a complaint about food or about kids not going to school, parent disciplining a child within the regional centre, that makes up the 2,000.</em></p> <p>The files published by the Guardian do contain a range of types of reports, but they are considerably more severe and significant than Dutton has suggested. Many of the files contain eyewitness testimony from the guards, caseworkers, child protection workers and teachers on the island. This primary evidence carries considerable weight, particularly when these staff members see first-hand instances of abuse or assaults. They are not historical, and date up to October 2015, well beyond the scope of successive Australian government inquiries into much earlier allegations.</p> <p>By way of example of the seriousness of incidents, there were 156 reports of threatened self-harm involving children. There were 59 reports of assault on a minor, and 170 reports of \u201cconcern for a minor\u201d \u2013 which includes everything from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive#incident=sca141033\">an uneven floor that might cause people to trip</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive#incident=sca140048\">alleged sexual assault</a> and <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/08/nu-files/pdf/sca141120.pdf\">self-harm</a>.</p> <p>There are more than just those though. Mis-categorisation incidents is also a theme throughout the data \u2013 and we know that serious events are also simply not reported on Nauru \u2013 so even these counts are likely to be a conservative estimate. </p> <p>Even the less serious events contribute to a stressful environment of surveillance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/11/nauru-teachers-speak-out-for-children-we-dont-have-to-torture-them\">say former teachers who worked on the island.</a> Sometimes caseworkers will document an incident that could be considered less severe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/11/from-pleas-to-threats-to-harm-files-reveal-escalation-of-trauma-on-nauru\">because they know that incidents can quickly escalate to self harms or other forms of serious incidents,</a> as the length of detention of asylum seekers steadily increases.</p> <h2><strong>The seriousness of incidents disclosed in the Nauru files</strong></h2> <p>Dutton: <em>Well, out of the 2,000 as I understand it, those analysed so far ... over 20 are critical, so you\u2019re talking about where there\u2019s been an allegation of sexual assault, so that might be a person within the regional processing centre that\u2019s alleged to have assaulted a female or male within the centre.</em></p> <p>Dutton\u2019s comments vastly underestimate of the seriousness of incidents. The security company Wilson Security <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/nauru-files-show-wilson-security-staff-regularly-downgraded-reports-of-abuse\">has regularly downgraded the seriousness of incident reports on the island</a>, among four descending categories of critical, major, minor and information. So a report of self-harm that should be critical could be downgraded to major. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/20/the-worst-ive-seen-trauma-expert-lifts-lid-on-atrocity-of-australias-detention-regime\">Psychologist and traumatologist Paul Stevenson</a>, who visited Nauru 12 times to counsel and support Wilson guards, said reports were regularly downgraded and there was a constant financial pressure to de-escalate the reported severity of fights or acts of self-harm.</p> <p>As a consequence of this dubious record-keeping there are far more reports of sexual assault and child abuse than Dutton has claimed.</p> <h2><strong>Australia\u2019s role on Nauru</strong></h2> <p>Dutton: <em>\u201cWe will work with the Nauruan authorities and police force to provide support to those people [who make allegations of abuse] ... Nauru is not part of Australia, so this is an issue for the Nauruan government.\u201d</em></p> <p>This perennial myth peddled by the Australian government doesn\u2019t stack up with a vast body of legal opinion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/03/high-court-upholds-australias-right-to-detain-asylum-seekers-offshore\">including from the high court of Australia</a> and the Australian Senate. Australia established the Nauru detention centre and maintains effective control over its operations. Serious allegations that occur at the centre are a matter for Australia both as a matter of domestic and international law.</p> <h2><strong>Investigating allegations of sexual abuse or assaults</strong></h2> <p>Dutton:<em> We\u2019ve been adamant we want to treat people rightly, we will investigate. I\u2019ve been clear from day one I won\u2019t tolerate one incidence of sexual abuse or any abuse, whether it\u2019s towards a child, female, or male, on Nauru, in Manus.</em></p> <p>Many concerns have been raised about the capacity of the Nauruan police force to investigate allegations of abuse and sexual assault. The internal investigations of the companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jun/09/asylum-seekers-abused-on-nauru-may-never-get-justice-says-former-adviser\">on the island has also been criticised</a>, because they essentially involve organisations investigating their own staff over allegations of assaults. As a consequence, there is doubt over the effectiveness of the investigating processes set up on Nauru in the absence of other independent oversight.</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear whether many of the allegations contained in the Nauru files have ever been appropriately dealt with. The reporting of serious allegations is flawed, and incidents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/nauru-files-show-wilson-security-staff-regularly-downgraded-reports-of-abuse\">are regularly downgraded in seriousness</a>.

The current model EVs have <a href=\"http://www.cheatsheet.com/automobiles/top-10-electric-vehicles-with-the-longest-driving-range.html/?a=viewall\" rel=\"nofollow\">ranges of more than 300km</a> and sell for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/01/the-chevy-bolt-costs-30k-and-goes-200-miles-on-a-charge/\" rel=\"nofollow\">less than $40,000</a> in the United States. Given that the average daily car trip by Australians is 35km, according to the <a href=\"https://transportplanorg.wordpress.com/key-findings/convenient/#more-301]\" rel=\"nofollow\">Victorian Department of Transport</a>, one has to wonder what the fuss about range is anyway. Even the most modest EVs easily cover three times that distance, and the Tesla model S covers 10 times that. No wonder <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/24/this-country-has-hit-a-major-milestone-for-electric-cars-heres-how.html)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Norway </a> and the <a href=\"http://insideevs.com/netherlands-moves-to-allow-only-all-evs-by-2025-no-more-gas-diesel-sales/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netherlands</a> are aiming to have their entire passenger fleet 100% electric by 2025.</p> <p>With all the discussion about renewables and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/01/windfarms-unfairly-blamed-for-south-australias-high-energy-prices\"> the electricity grid</a>, EVs can also play an important role in stabilising the grid. Charging your EV at work or while you are shopping will soon become a reality everywhere and when you return home in the evening (when demand for electricity peaks), your EV will supplement your home energy needs. The perfect complement to rooftop solar and battery home storage, electric vehicles will make \u201c<a href=\"http://www.energyfreedom.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">energy freedom</a>\u201d and no power bills a reality. </p> <p>But what about the cost? Recent modelling by Beyond Zero Emissions shows that to shift the entire Australian car passenger fleet to 100% electric in 10 years<em> </em>would cost only 25% more ($1,200bn) than replacing the same fleet with traditional internal combustion engine (Ice) vehicles at a cost of $1,000bn. </p> <p>This cost is highly dependent on assumptions related to the price of oil over that period, the price of batteries, and the price of EVs. If battery and EV prices fall more rapidly over the period, and the price of oil increases more rapidly, replacing the fleet with EVs could be cost-neutral. </p> <p>This also factors in the cost of public EV charging infrastructure (approximately $100bn) and the cost of charging the vehicles with 100% renewable electricity. Charging the vehicles with anything but renewable electricity means the full benefits of EVs will not be realised, which is the ability to have a pure zero carbon transport system. And as car sharing becomes mainstream, reducing car ownership and enhancing other forms of transport such as public transport will make transitioning the fleet to EVs even easier.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/04/mining-town-coober-pedy-shows-the-rest-of-australiahow-to-turn-to-renewables\">Mining town Coober Pedy shows the rest of Australia how to turn to renewables</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Interestingly, Beyond Zero Emissions\u2019 <a href=\"http://bze.org.au/blog/electric-vehicle-report-release-date-august-12th-2016-160724\" rel=\"nofollow\">modelling</a> shows that it will be even more cost-effective to convert the entire Australian bus fleet to electric buses over 10 years. This could only cost 10% more ($7bn) than replacing Australia\u2019s bus fleet with traditional fossil-fuel-powered buses. With higher prices for oil, and lower prices for batteries and electric buses, the cost of moving the bus fleet to electric could be 12% less than continuing to operate ICE buses. </p> <p>Local governments can\u2019t wait to get in on the action. Many<em> </em>are said to be talking to Tesla about installing the energy storage company\u2019s supercharger stations in their area. But we need a suitable policy framework and incentives at all levels of government to get this moving. </p> <p>At the federal government level, we need a reduction in sales tax for EVs. This is already happening in France, Germany, Japan, Norway and the Netherlands. At the state or territory government level, we need low or no registration fees for EVs. And at the local government level, we need free parking for EVs and access to transit lanes in peak hour, as we have for motorbikes, buses, taxis and cars with more than one person, and as they do in cities such as Copenhagen, Oslo, Barcelona, London and Los Angeles.</p> <p>We also need a targeted education campaign from government highlighting the benefits of EVs, including lower pollution and <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/env/the-cost-of-air-pollution-9789264210448-en.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">pollution-related deaths</a>. </p> <p>And finally we need to break the relationship between the oil majors and motor vehicle companies that has impeded the development and penetration of EVs for so many decades. One way to do this would be to have proactive renewable electricity retailers supporting the shift to renewables and EVs as part of a zero emissions home energy package, just as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.esdnews.com.au/agl-announces-can-eat/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AGL</a> has started to do.

Public opinion has ebbed and flowed in the interim, between outright hostility towards asylum seekers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/29/majority-of-australians-say-refugees-who-arrive-by-boat-should-be-let-in-poll-finds\">far more compassion</a>, and yet Australia now finds itself as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/27/cruelty-to-asylum-seekers-dressed-up-as-compassion-is-the-scandal-that-bedevils-australia\">global leader</a> in new and innovative ways to punish powerless people.</p> <p>The recent report by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch about Australia deliberately ignoring abuses on the Pacific island of Nauru, where hundreds of men, women and children live in unsafe, indefinite detention, received <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/australia-deliberately-ignores-refugee-abuse-report-160803035220923.html\">large global</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/world/australia/nauru-refugees-abuse-conditions.html?_r=0\">coverage</a>.

It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 still believed by countless people I have met when working in Palestine, Honduras, Africa and the United States.<br></p> <p>I\u2019m now constantly asked why Australia, an island state, needs to further traumatise refugees fleeing Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. Instead of being a global pariah for this behaviour, Canberra is increasingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/18/australias-refugee-policies-a-global-inspiration-for-all-the-wrong-reasons\">admired and envied</a> by European countries desperately trying to keep out Muslims from the Middle East and Africa. The Nauru files <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/11/nauru-security-guard-grabbed-boy-by-throat-and-banged-head-against-ground\">prove</a> that privatised security is willing to use violence, intimidation and mockery to quash adult and child complaints.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s not just the ways in which asylum seekers are isolated that brings admiration for Australia globally but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/08/detention-centre-operators-contract-extended-despite-owners-objection\">outsourcing</a> the tasks of imprisonment to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/11/serco-is-failing-but-is-maintained-afloat-thanks-to-australias-refugee-policy\">failing private companies</a>.

The same multinationals are selling weapons that fuel the wars and helping Europe keep out its victims. The almost weekly terror attacks in Europe are empowering this business model and it will only get worse.</p> <p>The prospects for Australia\u2019s immigration stance to change is slim.

Civilians caught in the middle of wars in the Middle East and Africa will just have to suffer in silence. </p> <p>There\u2019s a lesson in this for Australia and it\u2019s not pretty. Australia was well ahead of the global curve in its treatment of asylum seekers and rather than being a pariah, as I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/20/its-time-for-un-sanctions-on-australia-our-government-deserves-nothing-less\">argued in 2014</a> when calling for sanctions against Canberra, it\u2019s become an inspiration.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2014/jan/21/reward-attempt-citizens-arrest-tony-blair\">Why I'll be rewarding the latest attempt to make a citizen's arrest on Tony Blair</a> </p> </aside>  <p> But not for all.
