  "<p>The NHS would collapse without its 57,000 workers who are EU nationals and they must be offered free British citizenship so they don\u2019t leave the country after Brexit, according to a leading thinktank.</p> <p>The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) says in a report released on Thursday the concessions to EU nationals living in Britain are needed to prevent a post-Brexit brain-drain of talent harming the economy.</p> <p>Chris Murray, who compiled the report, said: \u201cIt is critical to public health that these workers do not seek jobs elsewhere. All EU nationals who work for the NHS, or as locums in the NHS system, should be eligible to apply for British citizenship. This offer should be organised by the regional NHS and mental health trusts, who would be responsible for writing to all NHS staff who are EU nationals to inform them of their eligibility.\u201d</p> <p>In particular, according to Murray, the position of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/26/nhs-foreign-nationals-immigration-health-service\">EU citizens working in the NHS</a> needs to be safeguarded by making them a \u201cgenerous citizenship offer\u201d. He added: \u201cThere are currently around 57,000 EU nationals working in the English NHS, accounting for 5% of its workforce; one in 10 of the UK\u2019s registered doctors is an EU national. Without them the NHS would collapse.\u201d</p> <p>One of its proposals is to reform UK citizenship laws, including waiving the \u00a31,200 citizenship fee for NHS workers.</p> <p>The report is published as the latest official quarterly migration statistics are released on Thursday, showing whether there was a spike in EU nationals coming to Britain or applying for citizenship in the three months before the 23 June referendum.</p> <p>The Brexit result has left the future <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/04/future-of-eu-nationals-in-uk-uncertain-may-comments-tory-leadership-brexit\">status of 3 million EU citizens living in Britain uncertain</a>. While the IPPR says their deportation is ultimately unlikely, the lack of official reassurance is already having a chilling effect on those seeking jobs, housing, bank loans or making other long-term commitments.</p> <p>The NHS has become increasingly reliant on EU nationals to keep it on its feet, with the numbers employed rising from 33,420 in 2012 to 41,566 in 2014. As of February this year, 57,063 of the NHS\u2019s 1.2 million staff are citizens of other EU countries. The latest figure includes more than 7,000 EU nationals working as consultants or specialist registrars and more than 21,000 as nurses and health visitors.</p> <p>The IPPR also suggests that any EU nationals who have lived in Britain for more than six years should be automatically entitled to British citizenship, as well as all children of EU nationals who have been educated in the UK. Automatic indefinite leave to remain should be offered to all other EU migrants currently in Britain.</p> <p>The thinktank says wider reform of the current system of British citizenship is so overly complicated and bureaucratic that it is deterring the high earners that the British economy needs, and is so expensive that it also deters the lower skilled workers that the sectors of the economy that depend on manual labour also need.</p> <p>To deal with these problems, the IPPR says those with globally competitive skills should be able to pay extra to get a fast-track to citizenship while those in low wage jobs should be offered a government-backed loan \u2013 like a student loan \u2013 to enable them to pay back the costs of becoming a UK citizen over years.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a British Future/ICM poll showed that the public does not believe the government will meet its target to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/04/david-cameron-eu-referendum-net-migration-target\">reduce net migration</a> to below 100,000 a year by 2020 even after Brexit takes place. In the poll, which was conducted just after the referendum in June, only 37% agreed the net migration target was likely to be reached in the next five years.</p> <p>The government\u2019s outgoing chief advisor on migration, Prof David Metcalf, also called for a much stronger enforcement of minimum labour standards in the UK to ensure the country\u2019s flexible labour market prevents undercutting by foreign workers and boosts the welfare of British residents.</p> <p>After nine years as chairman of the home secretary\u2019s migration advisory committee, Metcalf said in a valedictory report that half the current level of immigration \u2013 308,000 out of 630,000 \u2013 was work-related. He said skilled migration was much more likely than migration by people with low skills to be complementary to British labour and capital, adding: \u201cThey contribute, net, to productivity, the public finances and the employment prospects of local labour.\u201d</p> <p>Metcalf said the number of labour migrants was heavily influenced by other public and private employer policies, saying that private sector employers had invested too little in the science, technology and IT skills of UK residents, which has led to the constant pleas for such jobs to be given priority in immigration. He hoped that higher migrant pay thresholds and the new \u00a31,000 immigration skills charge would encourage greater training.</p> <p>He also warned that public spending constraints often led to greater immigration, particularly for nurses, paramedics, care sector and science and maths teachers.</p> <p>But he said that while low-skilled migration benefited labour-intensive British employers and most such migrants, they also exerted a downward pressure on the pay of low-skilled workers and \u2013 in the worst examples \u2013 serious exploitation of migrant, and possibly UK, labour.</p> <p>\u201cTherefore it is crucial that minimum labour standards are enforced,\u201d Metcalf concluded. \u201cAlas, evidence suggests that in pursuing our flexible labour market \u2013 which has mostly served us well \u2013 such enforcement is inadequate. Incomplete supervision holds for the national minimum wage, labour gangs (particularly in horticulture) and employment agencies for migrants.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The Israeli military has cleared its forces of wrongdoing in a string of deadly incidents that took place during the 2014 Gaza war \u2013 including an airstrike that killed 15 members of a single family and the bombing of a United Nations school.<br></p> <p>Israel\u2019s investigative process is at the heart of a Palestinian case to press for war crimes charges against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/jan/16/icc-possible-war-crimes-palestinian-territories\">Israel at the International Criminal Court in the Hague</a>. The Palestinians say that Israel has a poor record of prosecuting wrongdoing in its ranks.</p> <p>In a statement on Wednesday, the military said it had closed a total of seven investigations without filing charges after a special team collected testimony from Gaza residents and Israeli officers.</p> <p>The deadliest incident involved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/israel-bombards-rafah-soldier-disappears-gaza-ceasefire-collapse\">an airstrike in the southern Gaza town of Rafah</a> on 1 August 2014, that killed 15 members of the Zoroub family.</p> <p>The army said the building was used by Hamas as a command and control centre. While its statement suggested that the civilian casualties were higher than expected, it said the airstrike was in line with international law, which can allow attacks on homes used for military purposes. It said that among the dead was Nazmi Zoroub, whom it identified as a senior Hamas commander.</p> <p>\u201cThe attack complied with the principle of proportionality, as at the time the decision to attack was taken it was considered that the collateral damage expected to arise as a result of the attack would not be excessive in relation to the military advantage anticipated from it,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Adel Zoroub, whose sister\u2019s home was destroyed, rejected the army\u2019s findings. He said Nazmi Zoroub was wounded in a different Israeli attack and was not in the building.</p> <p>The army also said it would not file charges over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/03/israel-air-strike-un-school-gaza-rafah\">the shelling of a United Nations school in the southern Gaza town of Rafah</a> in which 10 people died. The attack was strongly condemned by UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, while the United States called it \u201cdisgraceful\u201d.</p> <p>The military report said that shortly before the incident three Palestinian fighters were spotted riding a motorcycle in Rafah. A decision was made to make an airstrike on them using a low-explosive missile to minimise damage to surroundings and after a sweep of the area showed no civilians in harm\u2019s way.</p> <p>It said that after the missile was launched the men unexpectedly headed off a roundabout with multiple exits, toward the school gate.</p> <p>The report said the Military Advocate General\u2019s examination concluded that proper procedures were followed.</p> <p>The army also said it found no wrongdoing in a 21 July 2014, incident that left 12 members of the Siyam family in Rafah dead. It said it could not find evidence to back claims that they were killed by an Israeli airstrike and that they had in fact been killed by mortar shells misfired by Palestinian militants.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The army also found no wrongdoing in an airstrike a day earlier that killed seven members of the Ziyadeh family in the Bureij refugee camp. It said the building had been used as a command and control center by Hamas and that several militants, including three members of the family and a top Hamas military leader, were among the dead.</p> <p>The Ziyadeh family declined to comment and Siyam family members could not immediately be reached.</p> <p>Israel launched the war in response to weeks of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/08/israel-steps-up-offensive-against-gaza-live-updates\">heavy rocket fire by Palestinian militants</a> in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. During 50 days of fighting, more than 2,200 Palestinians were killed, and 73 people on the Israeli side were killed. More than 1,400 Palestinian civilians were among the dead, according to UN figures.</p> <p>Israel says Hamas is responsible for the high civilian death toll, saying the group used the local population as human shields while firing rockets from residential areas.</p> <p>A 2015 UN investigation found evidence of war crimes by both sides, saying Israel appeared to have used disproportionate force and endangered civilians. It also criticised Hamas for firing rockets indiscriminately toward civilian areas in Israel.</p> <p>The international criminal court has opened a preliminary examination of Israeli conduct in the war, but issued no conclusions. The court can intervene in cases where a country is deemed incapable of conducting a proper investigation.</p> <p>The military says it looked into some 360 complaints connected to the war. It has found enough evidence to launch around 31 criminal investigations. At least 13 of those probes have been closed, with indictments in only three cases of alleged looting by soldiers.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cEvery time an ethnic person comes on screen, 50,000 people change the channel.\u201d<br></p> <p>I was relatively new to the world of television when I heard an executive say that in a meeting. I was both stunned and acutely aware that I held the least amount of power in the room. </p> <p>Later a colleague explained to me the concept of minute-by-minute ratings, which pinpoint the exact moment viewers change the channel or turn off their TV. Presumably the networks or their advisors had examined the dips and spikes in the ratings and concluded that when people of colour turn up, Australia tunes out. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/24/indigenous-well-represented-on-australian-tv-but-diversity-has-long-way-to-go-report\">Indigenous well-represented on Australian TV but diversity has \u2018long way to go\u2019 \u2013 report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This conclusion is patronising and outdated at best and completely false at worst (we didn\u2019t experience a mass exodus from movie theatres when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/29/star-wars-the-force-awakens-black-lives-matters-first-science-fiction-film\">a black stormtrooper</a> was introduced in Star Wars), and yet since the dawn of Australian television 60 years ago, what effectively amounts to a White Australia Policy has been governing who appears on our screens and the manner in which they are depicted. </p> <p>The fault of the problem is broader than simply commissioning networks and their executives. I\u2019ve experienced an entire culture of resistance when it comes to diversity on-screen. I remember a production meeting on a different show later in my career, when I pointed out to the crew present that casting the only Asian actor in an entire series to play a criminal would be problematic. My solution was to cast another Asian actor in a positive role \u2013 at that stage a few police officers were up for grabs. </p> <p>Unfortunately, nobody else shared my view \u2013 or if they did, they chose not to vocalise it. You could argue that the resistance was less to diversity than it was to a mouthy young writer who hadn\u2019t earned the right to offer opinions on casting; television can be very territorial like that. Either way, there was a palpable reaction to the challenging of the status quo, and another Asian actor got to add \u201ccriminal\u201d to their IMDB page. (And no, I didn\u2019t succeed in getting another Asian character in the mix.)</p> <p>In television as in most industries, the higher you are in the ranks, the more weight is given to your opinion. If you\u2019re just starting out and push for a more inclusive industry, the people above you will tend to just hear you calling them prejudiced. And in my experience, their first response will be to deny that a problem exists: Australian television <em>does </em>accurately reflect our society, and if you think otherwise, that\u2019s <em>your </em>problem. </p> <p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/24/indigenous-well-represented-on-australian-tv-but-diversity-has-long-way-to-go-report\">research released this week by Screen Australia</a>, which I consulted on, this fingers-in-the-ears argument has been officially decommissioned.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/sa/newsroom/news/2016/mr-160824-study-of-diversity-on-tv-released?platform=hootsuite\">Seeing Ourselves: Reflections on Diversity in TV Drama</a> is the first analysis in 14 years into diversity on Australian scripted television. The results confirm that a gulf exists between the diversity we see in our day to day lives, and what is depicted on-screen. Our television is not progressing at the same rate as Australia is diversifying, with non-European minorities \u2013 including from Indian, Asian and Middle Eastern backgrounds \u2013 accounting for only 6% of on-screen characters, despite making up 17% of the Australian population.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"452992ae79a804a166e880702940347bca24d329\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/452992ae79a804a166e880702940347bca24d329/0_0_3988_1938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graph from Screen Australia\u2019s 2016 report on diversity in Australian TV\" width=\"1000\" height=\"486\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The biggest disparity from population to screen befell people with a disability. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 18% of Australians reported having a disability in 2012, but only 4% of the main characters in Australian TV dramas broadcast between 2011 and 2015 were identifiably characters with a disability. The report shows that we are also still lacking when it comes to LGBTQI representation.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s not all bad news: Indigenous Australians make up 3% of the population and are represented at 5% on screen, a success which the head of the Indigenous department at Screen Australia, Penny Smallacombe, said came down to having more Indigenous decision-makers behind the scenes, and government and funding initiatives supporting them.</p> <p>This brings us to an interesting point. While the Screen Australia study did not attempt to capture the diversity of people behind the scenes in the television industry, according to 2011 census data 73% of people in the screen industries are from Anglo-Celtic backgrounds compared with 67% among other industries. The Screen Australia report says \u201ca diversity of backgrounds among decision-makers as well as producers, directors and writers\u201d will facilitate diversity in content. </p> <p>The benefits go beyond simply social inclusion; there is growing research to support the idea of the \u201cdiversity dividend\u201d. </p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters\">McKinsey research from 2015</a>, companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35% more likely to outperform their respective national industry medians. Earlier this year, the <a href=\"http://www.bunchecenter.ucla.edu/index.php/2016/02/new-2016-hollywood-diversity-report-business-as-usual/\">UCLA Hollywood Diversity Report</a> found that TV shows with culturally diverse casts rate better than shows without.</p> <p>We\u2019ve all intuitively felt that our screens were underperforming on diversity. Still, as someone who has fought for diversity from the inside \u2013 sometimes unsuccessfully \u2013 I can\u2019t overstate how important it is to have official data from our federal screen funding agency to help me make my case. Every time a practitioner is made to feel troublesome or obsessive when they push for inclusion, here is the report that says: \u201cYou\u2019re not imagining this problem.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b43b2e61fd2a4596583d3bfc157e8232ce5070ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b43b2e61fd2a4596583d3bfc157e8232ce5070ed/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephanie Son, Laurence Leung and Dave Eastgate in ABC comedy series Maximum Choppage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephanie Son, Lawrence Leung and Dave Eastgate in ABC comedy series Maximum Choppage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In terms of cultural diversity, a lot has changed in the last five years.

Nine also cast Indigenous actor Miranda Tapsell in the high-rating drama Love Child \u2013 which won Tapsell two Logie awards \u2013 and brought a Lebanese family to prime-time with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/10/here-come-the-habibs-review-well-meaning-but-underwhelming-lebanese-by-numbers\">Here Come the Habibs</a>.

The ABC, our tax-funded broadcaster, could set a diversity target: increasing the current 18% of characters from non-Anglo-Celtic backgrounds to match the population of 32% by 2020, for instance. </p> <p>We have seen the massive <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/comment/cinema-culture-richer-after-rise-of-indigenous-voices-20130604-2no4e.html\">gains</a> made in Indigenous screen content thanks to targeted state and federal funding and commitment from training institutions, production companies and broadcasters.

With Trump lagging in the polls, just as Brexit did prior to the vote on the referendum, Farage will also hearten supporters by insisting that they can prove pundits and oddsmakers wrong as well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/how-remain-failed-inside-story-doomed-campaign\">How remain failed: the inside story of a doomed campaign | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This message resonates with the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts to reach out to blue collar voters who have become disillusioned with American politics, while also adding a unique flair to Trump\u2019s never staid campaign rallies.</p> <p>The event will mark the first meeting between Farage and Trump.</p> <p>Arron Banks, the businessman who backed Leave.EU, the Brexit campaign group associated with the UK Independence party (Ukip), tweeted that he would be meeting Trump over dinner and was looking forward to Farage\u2019s speech.</p> <p>The appointment last week of Stephen Bannon, former chairman of the Breitbart website, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/steve-bannon-profile-breitbart-trump-campaign-manager\">\u201cCEO\u201d of Trump\u2019s campaign</a> has seen the example of the Brexit vote, which Breitbart enthusiastically advocated, rise to the fore in Trump\u2019s campaign narrative.</p> <p>Speaking to a local radio station before the joint rally, Farage urged Americans to \u201cgo out and fight\u201d against Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>\u201cI am going to say to people in this country that the circumstances, the similarities, the parallels between the people who voted Brexit and the people who could beat Clinton in a few weeks time here in America are uncanny,\u201d Farage told Super Talk Mississippi. \u201cIf they want things to change they have get up out of their chairs and go out and fight for it.

All I will say is that if you vote for Hillary Clinton, then nothing will change. She represents the very politics that we\u2019ve just broken through the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if he thought this was the biggest factor in the Brexit referendum, Farage said: \u201cIt was the key. It was the absolute key. The reason we won the referendum ... is that we believe immigration should be controlled.\u201d</p> <p>Both Farage and Trump are keen to limit immigration and protect voters against some of the impact of globalisation.<br></p> <p>Farage was condemned during the EU referendum campaign for using anti-immigration rhetoric, including a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants\">poster showing a queue of refugees</a> with the slogan \u201cBreaking Point\u201d; Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/donald-trump-immigration-test-isis-islamic-state-foreign-policy\">promised to impose \u201cextreme vetting\u201d</a> on potential immigrants.</p> <p>In a further parallel with Brexit politics, the Trump campaign has argued in recent days that it enjoys support not reflected in the polls, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/donald-trump-campaign-news-polls-kellyanne-conway\">undercover voters</a> who are shy about admitting their support for the controversial nominee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/766246213079498752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">They will soon be calling me MR.

Throughout the week, students are grouped by topics of first-year seminar courses they choose, such as Syria and the Refugee Crisis or Black Protest Traditions in African American Dance. Once orientation ends, students in the groups become classmates in the corresponding courses.

It\u2019s important, but the big piece is students having connections and being able to feel like they\u2019re welcomed and that this is the place for them.\u201d</p> <p>A number of colleges use outdoor orientations \u2013 such as hiking or camping in the wilderness \u2013 to welcome students to college life. A <a href=\"http://jee.sagepub.com/content/37/1/31.abstract\">2014 study</a> in the Journal of Experiential Education found that there were nearly 200 in the US and Canada. </p> <p>At the College of the Atlantic in Maine, orientation begins with a weeklong outdoor trip with a small group of about 10 students and two student leaders. The college of 350 students has only one major, human ecology, in which students choose their own curriculum.</p> <p>Students can choose trips with a variety of difficulties, from canoeing down the Allagash river or sea kayaking around Frenchman Bay to rock climbing in Acadia national park. Senior Julie Bowser said it was a weeklong bonding experience. \u201cEvery trip will come back with their own social code or inside jokes,\u201d she said.</p> <p>When Bowser was a freshman, she chose sea kayaking. One morning, she and her group got up at 4am to pack up camp and kayak out for the day so they could go out with the tide. \u201cAt that time of day, the ocean looks like a lake \u2013 it\u2019s glassy and calm,\u201d Bowser said. Over the campfire that night, it was all anyone could talk about.</p> <p>\u201cI think that some of the college craziness that happens at other orientations at other schools, like, oh, we stayed up drinking until 4am \u2013 well, we can provide a different type of experience. We also did something crazy.

  "<p>Larry Elliott\u2019s article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/20/brexit-eu-referendum-economy-project-fear\" title=\"\">Brexit Armageddon was a terrifying vision \u2013 but it simply hasn\u2019t happened</a>, 20 August) was a breath of fresh air. I speak as someone whose immediate family of five covered every opinion \u2013 remain, leave and abstain \u2013 but there was no animosity among us; we discussed our reasons in a civilised way and actually found there was quite a lot of agreement on most issues, albeit that we finally and narrowly voted differently, or not at all. I am proud of that. Since the result I have been appalled and depressed by the insults and derision thrown at leave voters, branding them all \u201cracist bigots\u201d and accusing them of \u201cruining our children\u2019s future\u201d. The hysterical media coverage and the self-righteous and self-congratulatory attitude of comedians and commentators has been unbelievable and shameful.</p> <p>The sky didn\u2019t fall in. We are rid of George Osborne and his promise of yet more austerity and a threatened recession. As Larry Elliott says, if nothing else it has forced the government to take a long hard look at the British economy, something that would not have happened without the shock administered by the referendum.</p> <p>Of course there will be challenges and difficulties, but there would have been if we had stayed in an increasingly free-market Europe which has delivered high unemployment and austerity to so many of its citizens. The European project was a noble concept which has become increasingly dysfunctional. You can love Europe (and I do) without endorsing the EU, which is a political organisation.<br><strong>Jill Rooney</strong><br><em>Ashtead, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott\u2019s depiction of our economy entering into some post-Brexit sunlit uplands defies belief. Equally absurd is his criticism of the EU for moving in a more free-market direction. It is the EU that has tried to mitigate the ravages of the free market so assiduously promoted by recent British governments. Does he really believe that Britain under Theresa May is going to enhance these rights and protections?</p> <p>More disturbing is his bald statement that the European project has failed. Has it? It was set up to secure peace in Europe after half a century of terrible wars, and it has made and continues to make a vital contribution to peace. Now, as we face new threats from Isis and from Putin\u2019s Russia, the EU is more necessary than ever before. Britain\u2019s exit has profoundly weakened one of the main institutions providing peace and security in Europe.</p> <p>Most disturbing of all, however, is Elliott\u2019s desire to shake things up. Brexit&#xa0;has certainly done that. The rise in racism, xenophobia and fear have indeed shaken things up for millions of people in this country. In addition our country now faces the real risk of breaking up. But no doubt peace and security, racism and xenophobia and the breakup of the UK are a price worth paying for shaking things up.<br><strong>Dr Shane O\u2019Rourke</strong><br><em>Department of history, University of York</em></p> <p>\u2022 The impact on savers is not mentioned in Larry Elliott\u2019s rosy post-Brexit analysis. The Bank of England has had to lower interest rates, and more may come in the autumn. Pensioners relying on savings to supplement their pension will certainly feel that the sky has fallen in as they pay the price of sorting out the mess.<br><strong>Ivan Laud</strong><br><em>Ashbourne, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Please can we have a full two-page debate between Larry Elliott and William Keegan (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/21/leavers-brexit-ashamed-harm-yet-to-come\" title=\"\">Leavers should be ashamed of the harm that is yet to come</a>, The Observer, 21 August).<br><strong>Professor Mike Elliott</strong><br><em>Leven, East Riding of Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Economists, politicians and journalists on both sides of the Brexit debate should know better and refrain from claiming the moral high ground each time a data point seems to give weight to their side of the argument. A Nobel prize in economics is not necessary to know that the consequences of Brexit will be unknown for many years to come, and until then everything should be considered aleatory \u201cnoise\u201d.</p> <p>There will only be one undeniable reality with Brexit: the UK and the EU will at the same time become trading partners and economic competitors (for&#xa0;future foreign investment).</p> <p>Once the new rules of engagement are finalised, it will require years of trials and tribulations to observe if the Brexit gamble pays off or not, the same way as it took decades to observe the relative economic decline of postwar Britain until, ironically, it joined the EU in 1973, with accession ratified in 1975 via referendum (please note the two-thirds majority) and oddly a majority of Conservatives favouring membership, a very split Labour party and an SNP totally against it.</p> <p>Maybe 2057 will be the year when future generations decide that their ancestors\u2019 \u201cnearly-no-skin-in-the-game\u201d gamble has not paid off (may they RIP), try to negotiate new terms for&#xa0;EU accession which will most likely be worse than the current ones from the early 1970s, and hold a referendum to WE-join the EU (assuming Scotland and Northern Ireland go their separate EU&#xa0;ways)?</p> <p>As the saying goes, history tends to repeat itself. Will it once more?<br><strong>Antero Touchard</strong><br><em>Madrid, Spain</em></p> <p>\u2022 As an ironic joke I proposed the launch of Brexit TV following the 23 June referendum result, which would only show reruns of sitcoms and Carry On films from before the UK joined the EU. Little did I realise that the BBC would really take us back to the 1970s, with Porridge and Are You Being Served? returning to our screens (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/23/keeping-up-appearances-are-you-being-served-porridge-till-death-us-do-part-return-bbc-sitcom-season\" title=\"\">New gags for old lags and plenty of jokes about a certain pet cat \u2013 the BBC goes back to the 70s</a>, 23&#xa0;August).<br><strong>Dr Alan Bullion</strong><br><em>Tunbridge Wells, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 In recent months the Guardian has referred repeatedly, and incorrectly, to \u201carticle 50 of the Lisbon treaty\u201d, most recently this week (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/22/brexit-means-brexit-when-is-big-question\" title=\"\">Two months on, EU exit is still a long way off</a>, 22 August). Let\u2019s be clear: there is no such article. The <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:FULL&amp;from=EN\" title=\"\">Treaty of Lisbon has only seven articles</a>. There is, however, Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This is the provision \u2013 inserted by the Treaty of Lisbon \u2013 that governs withdrawal. It would be useful if we all make sure we\u2019re reading and citing the right treaties.<br><strong>David Phinnemore</strong><br><em>Professor of European politics, Queen\u2019s&#xa0;University Belfast</em></p> <p>\u2022<em> </em>That Britain\u2019s \u201cdivorce\u201d from the EU will take time, as discussed in Jennifer Rankin\u2019s article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/brexit-trade-deals-gruelling-challenge-taking-back-control\" title=\"\">\u2018An unimaginably hard task\u2019: experts say divorcing EU will take 10 years</a>, 17 August), is undisputed, but the government should not be allowed to establish trading relations with the rest of the world that would merely mirror those of the European Union. Many people voted to leave because they were opposed to treaties being made with third countries that had less to do with trade and more to do with the hegemony of transnational corporations in the shaping of the global economy. Institutions such as the IMF and the OECD supported the opposite view because they correctly understood that the EU was a cornerstone of the neoliberal status quo and would be weakened by Britain\u2019s departure.</p> <p>So steeped have we become in neoliberal ideology that we cannot envisage a trading system that is not predicated upon free trade agreements and the rules of the World Trade Organisation. However, and contrary to the views expressed in your article, there is no need for British trade officials to \u201cpreserve UK ties to the 65 countries that have a trade agreement with the EU\u201d. Nor is there any compulsion to calculate what percentage of EU meat imports from South America accrue to the UK, or any other product for that matter. It is quite feasible to have international trade without prescriptive treaties.</p> <p>Once it has extricated itself from the tentacles of the European commission\u2019s trade mandate, Britain, as one of the world\u2019s largest economies, has a unique opportunity to trade with the rest of the world on a less exploitative and more equitable basis. Making this happen represents a huge challenge to those of us who have campaigned for too long against the worst aspects of EU free trade deals, only to see them replicated in a post-Brexit UK. <br><strong>Bert Schouwenburg</strong><br><em>International officer, GMB</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jennifer Rankin points out that at the moment we have no idea what Brexit means and that our negotiations face formidable obstacles, especially in new trade deals with the EU and the rest of the world. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-launches-conservative-leadership-bid-brexit-means-brexit-video\" title=\"\">Theresa May tells us \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d</a>, what she means is that the referendum verdict is final and irreversible. Indeed there is a widespread assumption that we are now bound to leave.</p> <p>But there is nothing sacrosanct about a referendum vote. If circumstances change dramatically before the date of our departure, which is at least three years away \u2013 if, for example, there is a massive change of public opinion in favour of remain \u2013 there would be every justification for a second referendum. And there is a strong likelihood that opinion will change.</p> <p>Most economists forecast a recession, and there are good reasons for pessimism. We are unlikely to follow Norway and remain members of the single market, as we would have to continue payments into the EU budget, could not regain control of our own borders, and would still be bound by EU regulations and directives, but without any say in their formulation.</p> <p>As it becomes clear that we will be excluded from the single market, more and more companies are likely to relocate to the continent. Uncertainty about future trade agreements will be bad for business investment and for the value of the pound. Perhaps most seriously, our huge trade deficit is financed by foreign capital, which may well flow out if the pound weakens further. We could face a serious recession, and more severe austerity.</p> <p>Leave campaigners promised us a glorious future outside the EU, with lots of extra money for the NHS. Before long, they may well feel they were sold a pup.<br><strong>Dick Taverne</strong><br><em>Liberal Democrats, House of Lords</em></p> <p>\u2022<em> </em>Larry Elliott blames \u201cproject fear\u201d, not Brexit, for undermining confidence. He is right that economists were nearly unanimous in opposing Brexit and he admits that it is still early days, but he is far too optimistic.</p> <p>How many economists believed there would be an immediate disaster before we even knew when or how Brexit would take place (or even if it will take place, given that negotiations might yet prove so complicated that the next general election comes first)? Most economists believed that there would be long-term costs and that whether they were large or small would depend on the deal that was negotiated. (A Norway-type deal might not have much effect, but immediate exit before negotiating any trade deals would be disaster.) So far we simply do not know what those long-term costs are going to be because we do not know what the government will do or how the negotiations will go.</p> <p>Larry Elliott picks out some seemingly good economic news. He omits the fact that, if it is not reversed (and it is not clear why it should be), the fall in the value of sterling has reduced our living standards permanently. The eventual cost could be much higher.</p> <p>As for the short term, if \u201cCity economists\u201d were forecasting immediate Armageddon, perhaps the lesson is that journalists should pay less attention to them and should listen more to academic economists. There were academic economists pointing out that short-term movements, which depend heavily on expectations, are hard to forecast. Maybe economists should have forecast a U-turn in policy towards the deficit (after six years when people who questioned the importance of reducing the deficit were ridiculed), that a sharp fall in the exchange rate would cause consumers to buy imported goods before prices rose, or that Olympic success would induce a feelgood factor, though it might be better to leave such speculations to City economists, concerned as much with day-to-day fluctuations in financial markets as with long-term prosperity.<br><strong>Roger Backhouse</strong><br><em>Professor of the history and philosophy of economics, University of Birmingham</em></p> <p>\u2022 For the last decade, I\u2019ve worked on economic and foreign policy issues related to South Korea, and prior to that studied for my MPhil at LSE. As a result, I\u2019ve had a fondness for both South Korea and the United Kingdom. Over the years, as I\u2019ve focused on South Korea professionally, I\u2019ve often wondered why South Korea couldn\u2019t be more like the UK. Needless to say, I was somewhat surprised by Christian Spurrier\u2019s suggestion that the UK should look to South Korea for inspiration on how to prosper post-Brexit (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/south-korea-economy-britain-brexit\" title=\"\">Want proof that Britain can thrive after Brexit? Look at South Korea</a>, 22 August).</p> <p>For developing nations around the world, South Korea should be an inspiration. Turning a war-torn, resourceless country into one of the world\u2019s most developed economies in a generation\u2019s lifetime is one of the most significant achievements of the second half of the 20th century. Seoul\u2019s success is demonstrable proof that countries can chart a better future, but it\u2019s less clear that it offers lessons for advanced economies like the UK.</p> <p>South Korea aspires to be everything most took for granted about the UK before Brexit. It is moving towards becoming more multicultural and is actively seeking to attract the world\u2019s best and brightest. Immigration is a necessity for South Korea. It wants to connect to the Eurasian continent and has pursued free trade agreements with the US and the EU for the very reason of injecting reforms into its economy to help boost it to the heights of an economy like the UK\u2019s. If Spurrier wants South Korea to be the model for the post-Brexit UK, perhaps he needs only to look to the pre-Brexit UK for the way forward.<br><strong>Troy Stangarone</strong><br><em>Senior director, congressional affairs and trade, Korea Economic Institute</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

He also said that the Kurds, who have won a series of recent battles against Isis, would be abandoned if they advanced. US jets gave cover to the Turkish push, one of the first times in the war that the two allies have conducted a joint operation.</p> <p>\u201cThey cannot, will not, under any circumstance get American support if they do not keep that commitment,\u201d Biden said in Ankara during a visit to reset ties with Turkey, which had been strained since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/turkey-coup-attempt-military-ankara-istanbul\">failed coup attempt</a> in July.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/syria_jarablus_update/giv-31075sYZU5qhjezx4/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/syria_jarablus_update/giv-31075sYZU5qhjezx4/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>The Turkish incursion, which was supported by Syrian rebels, was the largest into Syria in the five-year civil war and came after months of gains by Kurds in the north which had seriously tested relations with Washington and transformed the once-dormant border into one of the war\u2019s most important battle zones.<br></p> <p>Bystanders throughout much of the war, Kurdish groups in Syria\u2019s north-east had made swift gains after Russia\u2019s intervention to reinforce President Bashar al-Assad. At the same time, the Kurds had been pivotal to US efforts to break the grip of Isis in the area, being used as a proxy force by US trainers and given air support by fighter jets. </p> <p>The development incensed Ankara, which insists that the Kurds were using the war to advance a de facto autonomous region aligned with the aims of a four-decade-long insurrection being waged by Kurdish groups in Turkey\u2019s south-east. Turkish officials have repeatedly pointed to Kurdish manoeuvres along its 500-mile frontier as evidence of a plan to move Arabs from the area and create a buffer allowing the Kurds to consolidate influence in the area.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/kurdistan/giv-31075i0dL3dOx5liJ/\" data-alt=\"Kurdistan map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/kurdistan/giv-31075i0dL3dOx5liJ/\">Kurdistan map</a> </figure>  <p>In recent months, Turkey has stepped up its support for Syrian rebels battling both Isis and the Assad regime. The influence of rebel groups in the north had previously waned under Russian airstrikes and the creep of jihadi groups, who had gradually taken the ascendancy in key campaigns, such as the fight for Aleppo.</p> <p>A Turkish move to re-arm Syrian rebels, including jihadis, earlier this month had led to the siege of Aleppo imposed by Assad loyalists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/06/syria-rebels-unite-break-aleppo-siege\">being broken</a> and a supply line being reopened. </p> <p>Since then, Turkey has stepped up efforts to deter the Kurds from making further advances and to keep open access to Arab rebel areas.</p> <p>At the same time, Ankara has set aside a feud with Russia, which shares its insistence that Syria\u2019s current borders be preserved.

But climate simulations showed that the warming they observed could be explained purely by the small rise in greenhouse gas emissions.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe changes in greenhouse gases in the 19th century were small compared with the fairly rapid changes we see now, so seeing the climate respond this way was a surprise,\u201d said Abrams.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/aug/16/i-brought-the-graph-brian-cox-and-malcolm-roberts-debate-climate-change-on-qa-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5v2a4\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2658937\"            data-video-name=\"'I brought the graph': Brian Cox refutes claims of climage change denier on Q&amp;A \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"QandA\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b25278e4b0c23bfed89d72\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/16/160816climateqanada_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/16/160816climateqanada.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/16/160816climateqanada_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/aug/16/i-brought-the-graph-brian-cox-and-malcolm-roberts-debate-climate-change-on-qa-video\">\u2018I brought the graph\u2019: Brian Cox refutes claims of climage change denier on Q&amp;A</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The southern hemisphere, including Australasia and South America, appeared to start heating up 50 years later, near the turn of the century, while no sign of warming on the continental scale was noticed in Antarctica.

  "<p>Jeremy Corbyn offers a gateway back to Labour for younger Scots, according to youth activists who compare the movement around his leadership to the unprecedented political engagement prompted by the independence referendum of 2014.</p> <p>Speaking before Corbyn\u2019s first visit to Scotland since the Brexit vote, during which he will take part in hustings with leadership challenger Owen Smith in Glasgow on Thursday as well as rallying supporters in Edinburgh, young activists argue that growing numbers of those in their teens and 20s who supported pro-independence parties in the previous Westminster and Holyrood elections are being drawn back to Scottish Labour through Corbyn.</p> <p>Rhea Wolfson, who will become the youngest and only Scottish member of the NEC when her election is confirmed at next month\u2019s party conference, told the Guardian: \u201cYounger people who support the SNP and Greens are now going to Corbyn rallies. My frustration is that they see him as a figure of the left rather than of Labour, and we need to change that. He is an essential gateway to rebuilding Labour in Scotland as younger people come back to the party.\u201d </p> <p>Wolfson, a trade union organiser and member of Scottish Labour Young Socialists (SLYS), believes that the route to supporting Corbyn has been different for young people north and south of the border, where a significant proportion of the 12,000 strong membership of Momentum, the activist movement that propelled Corbyn to power last summer, is made up of under-30s. </p> <p>Scottish Labour admits that its membership has not seen a comparable increase to those in England and Wales since Corbyn\u2019s election as UK leader, which has also had no lasting impact on the party\u2019s standing in the polls. Indeed, last May Scottish Labour endured<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/scottish-labour-facing-third-place-after-collapse-in-vote\"> its worst election result in more than a century</a>, beaten into third place in the Holyrood elections behind the Scottish Conservatives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e7516b65d16ba80f15ea1bd04642d1fbaa8d854\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e7516b65d16ba80f15ea1bd04642d1fbaa8d854/0_270_3262_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon on local election results day\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s Scottish National party secured a third successive victory in the Holyrood elections in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Perry/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wolfson said: \u201cIn England, young people were politicised by the student fees protests and this was the first campaign to bring them into mainstream party politics.</p> <p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t happen in Scotland, where we didn\u2019t have the fees movement [university tuition is free], but the involvement came through the independence campaign. So people in their 20s in both countries have had a different political awakening.\u201d</p> <p>For Jenny Killin, a 24-year-old student sabbatical officer at Aberdeen University, the grassroots yes campaign of 2014 and the movement that has grown around Corbyn\u2019s leadership have a lot in common.</p> <p>\u201cThey both presented an opportunity for young people who were not previously engaged with politics to see themselves as active participants,\u201d says the former yes voter, who joined Scottish Labour several months after the pro-independence movement failed to secure a majority in the referendum of September 2014.</p> <p>Killin said she didn\u2019t join the Scottish National party in the membership surge that immediately followed its referendum defeat \u201cbecause for me independence wasn\u2019t about national identity but about the opportunity that it presented\u201d. While both the independence cause and the SNP have now become \u201csynonymous with leftwing politics in Scotland\u201d according to Killen, she said the party\u2019s position of taxation, for example, didn\u2019t align with her more socialist values.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s still a mistrust of the Labour party in Scotland but people are genuinely invigorated by what Corbyn has done,\u201d she added.</p> <p>It\u2019s a shift in perception of the SNP also noted by Ewan Gibbs, 26, another SLYS activist who estimates that around half of younger people now joining Scottish Labour voted for independence in 2014. </p> <p>\u201cThere is disillusionment with SNP, for example, not raising taxes on the wealthy, and young people\u2019s own experiences of the labour market are not tallying with the SNP\u2019s economic vision,\u201d Gibbs said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5a1822c017bb525a5029b79eaca1e380132292a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5a1822c017bb525a5029b79eaca1e380132292a/0_41_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Campaigners at a yes campaign rally in  2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Support for independence in 2014 was consistently higher among younger voters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He believes that many younger Labour supporters are keen to move away from the constitutional question. \u201cThose people who voted yes for reasons that were not largely nationalist are now looking at the Corbyn movement as a more effective way of achieving those objectives,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>Zara Kitson, 30, Scottish Greens activist who was heavily involved in the pro-independence movement, agrees that there are similarities between the broader yes campaign and grassroots support for Corbyn amongst younger voters. \u201cThere are definitely parallels, in that young people who felt disillusioned were offered a properly leftwing politics that seemed to better reflect their vision.\u201d </p> <p>But echoing Wolfson\u2019s concerns, Kitson said most young voters regarded Corbyn as \u201cat one remove from Scottish Labour\u201d. </p> <p>She said: \u201cYoung people in Scotland don\u2019t think Jeremy Corbyn in the answer to an independent, outward-looking, internationalist Scotland, and they are also very aware that the Scottish Labour leadership does not support him.\u201d</p> <p>While Corbyn <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/15/jeremy-corbyn-wins-backing-84-per-cent-local-labour-parties\">has the backing of the majority of constituency Labour parties in Scotland</a>, this is not reflected in the upper echelons of the party.

It is going towards you and away from you, periodically.\u201d</p> <p>This movement affects the colour of light detected from the star - as it the star moves slightly towards us we see the light as being slightly bluer - as it moves away the light appears a little redder. The frequency of this motion relates to the duration of the planet\u2019s orbit, and hence its distance from the star, while the magnitude of the motion provides information about the planet\u2019s mass.</p> <p>While analysis of data collected before 2016 hinted at the presence of a planet, it took a further intense round of data collection earlier this year before the discovery could be confirmed.<br></p> <p>Taking 11.2 days to travel around Proxima Centauri, the planet orbits at just 5% of the distance separating the Earth and the sun. But, researchers say, the planet is still within the habitable zone of its star because Proxima Centauri is a type of red dwarf known as an M dwarf - a smaller, cooler, dimmer type of star than our yellow dwarf sun.</p> <p>Whether the planet could harbour life, however, is matter of debate. <br></p> <p>Red dwarfs are generally very active stars, emitting powerful solar flares, with Proxima b receiving greater doses of high-energy radiation than reaches Earth from our sun. \u201cBecause they tend to have a lot of these flares and things like that, it makes it very difficult for [planets] to keep an atmosphere - these flares just blow the atmosphere away,\u201d said Don Pollacco, professor of astrophysics at the University of Warwick, who was not involved in the research. But, he adds, Proxima Centauri is only a moderately active red dwarf, potentially making its environment less hostile than other such stars. Whether the star\u2019s activity when it was younger could have stripped Proxima b of an atmosphere remains to be discovered, while it is also unknown if the planet has a magnetic field which could potentially protect it from such radiation.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2016/aug/24/proxima-centauri-planet-could-tell-us-about-alien-life-in-the-universe-exoplanet-proxima-b\">Proxima Centauri planet could tell us about alien life in the universe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The planet has other characteristics that could affect its potential to host life. <br></p> <p>The research reveals that if the planet\u2019s temperature were down to its sun alone, its surface would be, on average, a chilly -40C. \u201cIt seems cold, but then if you look at the same numbers for Earth you would get minus 20, minus 30C,\u201d says Anglada-Escud\u00e9. \u201cWhat keeps Earth warm is basically that it has an atmosphere and an ocean,\u201d he adds, pointing out that should the newly discovered world also boast an atmosphere, its temperature would likewise be higher.</p> <p>And there\u2019s more. It is very likely that the new world is tidally locked to Proxima Centauri (just as our own moon is to Earth) with only one side of the planet ever catching the star\u2019s rays.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are standing [on the side] looking at the star, you are quite warm,\u201d said Pollacco. \u201cIf you are on the other side it is bloody cold - continual night.\u201d</p> <p>Anglada-Escud\u00e9 is sanguine. If the planet has an atmosphere or an ocean, he says, the redistribution of heat could be possible. \u201cEven if you have tidal lock, you have a lot of circulation - it is like jet streams on Earth.\u201d</p> <p>But Pollacco believes discussion about the habitability of the new planet is somewhat premature, \u201cThese observations tell you nothing about the planet itself, it is important to realise that,\u201d he said, pointing out that there is no evidence that the planet has an atmosphere, or any water.</p> <p>Anglada-Escud\u00e9 admits that there is plenty to be unpicked about the new world. While its mass is thought to be at least 1.3 times that of the Earth, its size, and hence density, is unknown, meaning that scientists can only make an educated guess that it is likely to be rocky based on the types of exoplanets that have previously been detected around other small stars.</p> <p>And there are other mysteries to solve. The planet\u2019s location is also puzzling scientists, who say it is unlikely that the planet formed in its current location given that there would have been little planet-forming material available so close to the star. \u201cWhat we suspect is that the planet forms somewhere else, or the raw materials, the dust or the rocks or the ice, condense somewhere else and then ended up there through some migration process,\u201d said Anglada-Escud\u00e9. He points out that if the planet formed farther away from the star and migrated to its current position, it is likely to be a \u201cwater-world\u201d, whereas if it formed in its current location from dust that migrated, it is likely to be very dry unless water was later delivered to the planet by a comet or other body.</p> <p>While Pollacco describes the new discovery as symbolic, he believes the planet\u2019s potential for hosting life could remain a mystery for many years to come, not least because the chances of seeing the planet pass in front of its star - an observation, known as a transit, that is crucial to unravelling the planet\u2019s size and make-up - are low. </p> <p>Anglada-Escud\u00e9 is rather more optimistic. Even if a transit cannot be seen, he believes other techniques could shed light on the nature of the planet. \u201cThere are reasonable expectations that this planet can be detected with direct imaging within the next 10 years,\u201d he said, adding that it might also be possible to design a space telescope to orbit around the Earth and look at the new world.</p> <p>And with Proxima b just an interstellar stone\u2019s throw away, he believes the new discovery could inspire a wave of creativity in designing approaches for probing the planet further.</p> <p>\u201cJust the discovery, the sense of exploration, of finding something so close, I think it is what makes [it] very exciting,\u201d he said. </p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 24 August 2016.

As you\u2019d expect, I pay for my personal expenses whilst away and only reclaim what is a business expense.</p> <p>My personal life is obviously a private matter as it is for anyone else. But I deeply regret being the cause of so much adverse publicity and the damage that has been done to the Group\u2019s reputation. It has detracted from the great work which you do for our customers on a daily basis and from the major accomplishments of the past five years. This includes the Government shareholding having reduced from over 40% to around 9% with over \u00a316 billion plus dividends having been returned to taxpayers.</p> <p>More broadly I have been a strong advocate of expecting the highest professional standards from everyone at the bank, and that includes me. I will continue to strive to meet those standards. Having the highest professional standards raises the bar against which we are judged and as I have always said we must recognise that mistakes will be made. I don\u2019t expect anyone to get everything right all the time. The important point being how we learn from those mistakes and the decisions and actions we take afterward.</p> <p>As we look forward, it is your hard work over the last five years returning the Group to financial health that means we are best placed among our peers to continue supporting the UK economy and to help Britain prosper. We chose to focus on helping the UK economy \u2013 in particular through our support for first time buyers, small businesses and UK corporates \u2013 and as a result by choice, our future is inextricably linked with the future success of the UK economy.</p> <p>The extended period of low interest rates that we now face has created uncertainties for the UK economy and new challenges for the Group. And as a UK focused bank we are not immune to the factors likely to shape the UK economic outlook, but I believe we will be well positioned to meet them.</p> <p>With that in mind please be assured that I am as committed as ever to leading the Group forward to deliver our strategy and to meet our future ambitions. Thank you again for your messages of support over the last few weeks. I have greatly appreciated them.</p> <p>Best wishes</p> <p><strong>Ant\u00f3nio</strong></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ed9ce41d0d5b6e535eccaebcae693390fbbbf98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ed9ce41d0d5b6e535eccaebcae693390fbbbf98/0_0_1604_843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s memo to staff\" width=\"1000\" height=\"526\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T09:19:37.782Z\">at 10.19am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57bd627de4b0568600c03cc4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T09:05:54.754Z\">10.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong>, chief UK economist at <strong>IHS Global Insight</strong>, believes UK house prices will fall in 2016 and 2017 as greater uncertainty surrounding Brexit creeps in.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We suspect that house prices could ease back by around 3% over the latter months of 2016 and there could well be a further 5% drop in 2017.</p> <p>We believe housing market activity is likely to be limited over the coming months and prices will weaken as heightened uncertainty following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU weighs down on consumer confidence and willingness to engage in major transactions, and also hampers economic activity. </p> <p>The fundamentals for house buyers look likely to soften over the coming months with unemployment rising and purchasing power softening.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bd61ade4b0568600c03cc1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T09:01:23.445Z\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Samuel Tombs</strong>, chief UK economist at <strong>Pantheon Macroeconomics</strong> has a different interpretation of the BBA figures, arguing there are clear signs that Brexit is weighing on consumers\u2019 minds.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>July\u2019s mortgage approvals data bring clear evidence that the Brexit vote has made households reluctant to undertake major financial commitments. </p> <p>Following a 5% month-to-month fall in June, approvals fell a further 5.3% in July, leaving them at their lowest since January 2015 and down 19% year-over-year. </p> <p>The decline in approvals corresponds closely with the drop in RICS\u2019 measure of new buyer enquiries and indicators of consumer confidence, so the slowdown seems demand led. </p> <p>Housing transactions, which only edged down in July, have yet to register the full adverse impact of the Brexit vote.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bd5e29e4b048662988f9af\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T08:57:53.237Z\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The BBA\u2019s July data are the first set of borrowing figures since the Brexit vote on 23 June.</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Harding</strong>, <strong>BBA</strong> chief economist, says despite the drop in mortgage approvals the figures overall suggest the impact of the vote has had little negative impact so far.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"33587abe49153a1a0aed5da7d3d6342b8fce4272\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33587abe49153a1a0aed5da7d3d6342b8fce4272/0_0_3068_2277/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman with shopping bags\" width=\"1000\" height=\"742\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A breakdown of the numbers reinforces the picture that <strong>consumers</strong> have so far shrugged off Brexit uncertainty. <strong>Consumer credit was 6% higher </strong>in July than a year earlier, reflecting strong retail sales and - in the case of personal loans and overdrafts - low interest rates.</p> <p><strong>Borrowing by companies meanwhile increased by \u00a32.3bn</strong> in July after a small fall in June.</p> <p>Harding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The data does not currently suggest borrowing patterns have been significantly affected by the Brexit vote, but it is still early days.

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/24/sir-martin-sorrell-media-brexit-wpp-eu-referendum-itv\">Sorrell was firmly in the remain camp in the run-up to the 23 June referendum </a>and told BBC Radio 4\u2019s programme the UK\u2019s exit from the EU would be a long and uncertain process.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> It\u2019s very early days. What we did see from April to June was caution in front of the vote. What we saw after the vote in July was the UK perking up a bit. But that begs the question as to what the UK would have done in the absence of a Brexit vote or if the vote had gone the other way.</p> <p>We still worry. Business wants certainty. The government wants the best negotiating position with the EU and the two are actually in conflict. We would like a quick clean solution from a business point of view but the government needs a little bit of scope and time for negotiation.

Investment however was a drag.</p> <p><strong>Carsten Brzeski</strong>, <strong>ING</strong>\u2019s chief economist in Germany, comments on the outlook for Europe\u2019s largest economy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Private consumption should remain an important growth driver on the back of low inflation, low interest rates, low unemployment and higher wages. </p> <p>In addition, at least in the short run, the refugee crisis will continue to support domestic demand and the construction sector should rebound quickly after the technical correction on the second quarter. </p> <p>The economy\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel, however, remains the lack of new investment.

  "<p>Theatres can endlessly develop playwrights <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2016/jul/05/theatre-diversity-new-plays-london-writers-week\">without actually staging their work</a>, but it\u2019s only when a play is seen in front of an audience that it becomes apparent what works and what doesn\u2019t. So it\u2019s good to see Clean Break bringing these fledgling plays to production, even if one of the writers, Somalia Seaton \u2013 whose House is the more traditional and more successful half of this double bill \u2013 has already gone on to write more sophisticated work. Seaton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/02/fall-of-the-kingdom-rise-of-the-foot-soldier-review-rsc-making-mischief-festival\">Fall of the Kingdom, Rise of the Foot Soldier</a> has been playing in the RSC\u2019s Making Mischief season.<br></p> <p> There is much to enjoy in the strongly performed House, which takes us into the heart of a black family, where there is a homecoming. After five years away, Patricia (Shvorne Marks) has returned to visit the place where she was born and raised. The religious pictures are still on the wall; the smell of palm oil and crayfish is familiar. But who has invited her to return and where has she been for the last five years? \u201cThe world moves to a whole new beat when you ain\u2019t been out in it. It\u2019s a new start,\u201d says Patricia optimistically.</p> <p> But in order to make a new start, the ghosts of the past have to be confronted and laid to rest. As gradually becomes clear in a tense if slightly obvious family drama, Patricia\u2019s younger sister, Jemima (Rebecca Omogbehin), has no idea about the family secrets that lurk in the attic, and the sisters\u2019 mother (Michelle Greenidge) would prefer to blame her eldest daughter for the sins of others than to face up to the truth and her own collusion in what happened to her child.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a88355a0bac94111bb5b1db23d464fce56d5f04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a88355a0bac94111bb5b1db23d464fce56d5f04/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shvorne Marks (Patricia) and Rebecca Omogbehin (Jemima) in House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shvorne Marks (Patricia) and Rebecca Omogbehin (Jemima) in House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Shame also figures significantly in Chino Odimba\u2019s Amongst the Reeds. Oni, brought to the UK by an \u201cauntie\u201d who tried to enslave her, is desperate to remain here rather than face the shame of returning home; Gillian (Jan Le) was betrayed by an uncle, is heavily pregnant and is unable to contact her beloved father. Faced with a world that renders them invisible and an immigration system that refuses to see the truth about their lives, these two teenagers are holed up together in a derelict building, living in the dark.</p> <p> As with House, the characters are well developed \u2013 you believe in the needy Gillian and the bragging Oni, who may actually be the more dependent \u2013 but the scenario lacks a driving energy and several of the scenes are repetitive.</p> <p> The plays transfer to <a href=\"http://www.theyardtheatre.co.uk/\">the Yard</a> in London in early September. But like some other new plays at this year\u2019s festival, they feel as if they have been rushed into production and would have benefited from further development and redrafting. Both Seaton and Odima are already writing plays for other theatres, but this double bill hints at promise rather than confirming it. </p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/house-and-amongst-the-reeds\">the Assembly George Square</a>, Edinburgh, until 27 August.

Reserved seats are only reserved between certain stations and not if the reservee fails to show, just as Corbyn's own seats on an earlier train would be valid for someone else to have sat in.

Some years ago I worked in Huddersfield 20 odd miles away. I didn\u2019t need a car at work so wanted to use the train. I used a local station that was the last stop on the line from York to Leeds. I then needed to change trains at Leeds. Frequently the train into Leeds was so full that I was unable to get on because the areas around the doors were full of passengers standing. It used to infuriate me that people would not move down the train so I and others could get on but the basis of the problem was no seats. Too frequently this caused me problems in terms of arriving at work on time and I reverted to driving. Train travel seems to me to be very expensive yet often overcrowded, uncomfortable and inefficient. France is a far bigger country with a similar population. My experience of using trains in France, a much bigger country, suggests they can run a far more effective better quality and cheaper service.

  "<p><strong>Name</strong> Nicolas Sarkozy</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 61.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Short, scheming.</p> <p><strong>I remember him. Wasn\u2019t he in charge of France or something? And didn\u2019t he have that wife? </strong>He was president of France from 2007 until 2012 \u2013 well done for noticing. And yes, soon after being elected he divorced his wife, and four months later married the musician and former model <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/carla-bruni-sarkozy\" title=\"\">Carla Bruni</a>, the second former model of his three wives.</p> <p><strong>That\u2019s right. They call him \u201cSarko\u201d, don\u2019t they? </strong>They do. He\u2019s probably the biggest political personality in France.</p> <p><strong>Summarise this personality, please.</strong> Grandiose, charming, jingoistic, chippy. His hunger to become president was legendary before it finally happened.</p> <p><strong>Like Napoleon, basically?</strong> Basically. The French went off him badly towards the end, then changed their mind almost as soon as they replaced him with Hollande.</p> <p><strong>That\u2019s despite the lingering corruption allegations? </strong>For French presidents, those are not uncommon. Anyway Sarko has denied them and is now back. Undaunted, he\u2019s just announced that he plans to run for the presidency again next year, if he can win the Les R\u00e9publicains nomination.</p> <p><strong>He never sounded easily daunted.</strong> Indeed. And now he has moved on to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\" title=\"\">Marine Le Pen</a>\u2019s turf and rebranded himself as a man of the quite-far-right.</p> <p><strong>What does that mean?</strong> \u201cIt is time to engage in a determined combat against multiculturalism.\u201d That\u2019s from his <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3755132/Sarkozy-book-sets-presidential-comeback-platform.html\" title=\"\">new book</a>, Tout Pour la France, or Everything for France.</p> <p><strong>Cripes.</strong> He wants to \u201cdrastically reduce\u201d immigration, make people wait 10 years before applying for citizenship and suspend the right of legal immigrants to be joined by their close family.</p> <p><strong>Why can\u2019t people who move to France have the libert\u00e9 to live how they like?</strong> \u201cWe are not Anglo-Saxons who allow communities to live side by side while ignoring one another,\u201d Sarko writes. Basically everyone has to change their personality when they move to France.</p> <p><strong>Isn\u2019t that quite difficult for people to do? Might it not happen quicker if you don\u2019t force them, and doesn\u2019t it happen anyway after a couple of generations? </strong>Don\u2019t interrupt Sarko when he\u2019s talking tough.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \u201cImagine trying to get the Republican party nomination with lots of xenophobic posturing!\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say:</strong> \u201cYeah, that would never work.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Eowyn Ivey is a deft craftswoman, attentive to the shape and heft of her sentences. Like the couple in her first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/24/snow-child-eowyn-ivey-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Snow Child</em></a>, who build an icy model of a little girl that magically transforms into a living child, Ivey fashions characters who come to warm and vivid life against her frozen Alaskan landscapes.</p> <p>Her second novel, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=The+Bright+Edge+of+the+World&amp;order=relevance&amp;dir=desc\" title=\"\"><em>To the Bright Edge of the World</em></a>, is again set in Alaska but in 1885, a few decades earlier than the&#xa0;previous book: this is an era of explorers and prospectors rather than hardscrabble homesteaders. Through journal entries, military reports, letters and documents, Ivey lays down her story in shards, requiring the reader to piece together the final narrative. Like the modern-day museum archivist who is sent the parcel of materials by the explorer\u2019s descendant, we work through the pages, searching for illuminating connections. Yet Ivey manages to imbue this faux-documentary exposition with a prickly tension, a thrumming suspense shot through with foreboding.</p> <p>The US government has launched a&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/10-little-known-facts-about-the-lewis-and-clark-expedition\" title=\"\">Lewis and Clark</a>-style military expedition to explore the upper reaches of the&#xa0;wild Wolverine River. There, the party encounters native tribes who see no clear boundaries between the animal and human worlds. A shaman is said to shapeshift into a raven; a young woman believes her husband becomes a river otter; a spruce tree brings forth a human baby. Into this native timelessness blunder the Europeans, and they have their eye on the clock. As in an action movie, there\u2019s a constant tick-tock, the explorers must get through the river gorge before the spring thaw breaks up the ice pack and frees a&#xa0;deadly, rushing torrent; they need to&#xa0;cross the mountains and reach the Yukon before winter\u2019s freeze brings starvation. Meanwhile, left behind in Vancouver, the pregnant wife of the expedition leader explores her own destiny and presses against the rigid boundaries of social norms. Liminality is the theme throughout: the edges of the self and the other, of dream and waking, tame and wild, imagined and&#xa0;real.</p> <p>Ivey was born and raised in Alaska, presumably to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jrrtolkien\" title=\"\">JRR Tolkien</a> fans who named her after a <em>Lord of the Rings </em>heroine, which perhaps explains her affinity with myth and fantasy. She also possesses an encyclopedic grasp of her state\u2019s history and a poetic relationship to its landscape. \u201cThe canyon bound the Wolverine so that when, over the course of the winter, the ice moved, it crumpled violently,\u201d writes the group\u2019s leader in his journal. \u201cGreat blocks three feet thick &amp; as much as twenty feet high had been torn asunder &amp; turned sideways. It seemed an impassable range of buckles &amp; ridges &amp; upended slabs of ice pressed up against the canyon walls, which are vertical rock the colour of lead.\u201d The precision of such descriptions of the natural world ground the novel in a gritty verisimilitude that then allows Ivey to build a&#xa0;fanciful, daring imaginative edifice: the meticulous realism of the foundation allows the fabulous elements of her fiction to soar. Without them, the novel would not be so persuasive and&#xa0;vivid.</p> <p>Technically, there is much to admire here. The journals and letters have distinct authorial voices, and the tonal shifts that take place between a private diary reflection and an official military dispatch are wielded to sometimes breathtaking effect. With great economy and no trace of didacticism, we are shown that this seemingly innocuous journey of discovery will bring swift ruination on the native peoples and their precarious relationship with the unforgiving landscape.</p> <p>Perhaps living through Alaska\u2019s long dark winter gives a writer extra insight into melancholy. Certainly Ivey\u2019s scarred, sad characters are drawn with&#xa0;exquisite empathy. Everyone here carries burdens, both literal and metaphorical. And there is no easy unburdening. Love doesn\u2019t always save the day for these characters. For some, it is only an added weight, an additional snare.</p> <p>In a braided narrative, it can be difficult to keep a reader equally invested in two storylines, but Ivey makes the seemingly static story of Sophie Forrester just as compelling as the dynamic journey of her husband. Furthermore, she manages to merge the two at the end with an unexpected and original device that left this reader grinning with satisfaction.</p> <p>I have a predilection for reading about cold places while in the sweaty grip of summer, so the timing of this book is an added recommendation.

  "<h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy5cKX4jBkQ\">Born to Make You Happy</a></h2> <p>The title alone is uncomfortable to contemplate, and the song as a whole can only be described as a determined erasure of the autonomous self. Is the most disturbing line the one in which Britney apologises to her absent ex for crying over the split? Like most of her real relationships, this one doesn\u2019t seem as if it was ever that healthy. Forget the idea that Britney\u2019s job was to set any sort of example; calls for pop stars to be role models, especially in their music, are moralistic cant. Born to Make You Happy is horrifying as text and irresistible as pop, and the two are inextricable. The sugar-sweet melody \u2013 unlike her other early singles, this one required no modern production tricks \u2013 and that magnificent key change pull you in despite the horror; the song invites you to willingly, ecstatically, be swept into its darkness. The horror is not only that a sweetly smiling teenager is giving voice to disturbing emotions, but that this penchant for self-degradation and co-dependency is within us as well: she\u2019s tapped into it and forced us to enjoy it.</p> <h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJWtLf4-WWs\">Stronger</a></h2> <p>Of Britney\u2019s first five Max Martin-produced singles, four are variations on a theme sonically and lyrically, and form a narrative. If Britney begins in a position of powerlessness, so in thrall to her emotions that she sings about craving love as though she\u2019s begging for her life on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-u5WLJ9Yk4\">\u2026 Baby One More Time</a>, this swiftly gives way to a giddy mania on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4VK9_CfOLQ\">(You Drive Me) Crazy</a>. It\u2019s unclear whether she ever got the boy, but she\u2019s by no means prostrate. Full liberation from romantic myths came on her second album, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CduA0TULnow\">Oops! \u2026 I Did It Again</a>, with the title track\u2019s sarcastic rejection of the ultimate 90s fairytale, Titanic, when Britney isn\u2019t at all bothered about her lover rescuing the necklace dropped into the sea in the film. It was exorcised completely on Stronger, with its callback to Britney\u2019s debut. \u201cMy loneliness ain\u2019t killing me no more,\u201d she declared, and \u2013 as it would so many times over her career \u2013 freedom from dysfunctional emotion meant going deeper into the machine. Martin\u2019s formula for these singles is instantly familiar \u2013 the hard-edged crunch of his heavy-metal background recalibrated for pneumatic, kinetic pop beats. But each is harder-edged than its predecessor, as though Martin was testing to see how abrasive he could make pop radio: (You Drive Me) Crazy throws ringing percussion into the mix, Oops! pounds where \u2026 Baby One More Time pouted. Stronger is the toughest of the four. The three-note \u2026 Baby intro has morphed into a gnarly industrial stab of sound; the song gives way to a jacked-up <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/22/janet-jackson-superproducers-jimmy-jam-and-terry-lewis\">Jam &amp; Lewis </a>breakdown; and for the first but by no means last time, Britney embraces the inhuman qualities of her strange, hiccupping voice with vocals distorted and ground up against the beat.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuHi2hHZg6g\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OuHi2hHZg6g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkcLGts7lsw\">Anticipating</a></h2> <p>With Britney\u2019s third album came a move into grownup territory that was heavily telegraphed but no less effective, as she was paired with the Neptunes production team in their prime. The lead single, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzybwwf2HoQ\">I\u2019m a Slave 4 U</a>, was one of the most radical sonic statements in the chart at a time \u2013 autumn 2001 \u2013 when sonic radicalism could score well on the charts. Counterintuitively, one of the best songs on its parent album turned out to be one of the fluffiest, complexity-free tracks of her career. Uncomplicated joy has rarely been a hallmark of Britney\u2019s discography, but Anticipating nails it. There\u2019s some guy Britney\u2019s beckoning over, but the core of her pleasure is the DJ\u2019s sound and the song he\u2019s playing. With those swooping, gliding disco strings \u2013 check the momentary weightlessness at the start of the second verse, when they cradle Britney\u2019s voice when everything else drops out \u2013 who could blame her? Points, too, for bridging Britney to French house, courtesy of the gem that is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOCjphUxys\">the Alan Braxe remix</a>.</p> <h2>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beUj66P2GqA\">Before the Goodbye</a></h2> <p>Some of the best pop captures a feeling that lasts a fraction of a second and stretches it out over three minutes. Before the Goodbye, a collaboration with 90s trance producer BT which was initially \u2013 inexplicably \u2013 only released on the Japanese edition of Britney\u2019s third album, zeroes in on the momentary foreshadowing of loneliness and loss that flits across the mind despite the comforting presence of a lover. It\u2019s a brief feeling, a passing shadow, but Britney mines every aspect of it: the donning of emotional armour, the defensive pre-emptive apology, the fear of the impotency of loneliness. The beat stutters, stumbles and doesn\u2019t quite explode in the first chorus; we\u2019re almost halfway through before a pounding house rhythm emerges. It\u2019s a room with many doors, from uncertainty to release, and one of the best framings of Britney\u2019s voice to date. </p> <h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YzabSdk7ZA\">Everytime</a></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YzabSdk7ZA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8YzabSdk7ZA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>One of Britney\u2019s oddest curveballs was following the gleaming banger <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOZuxwVk7TU\">Toxic</a>, a song that resurrected her ailing career, with its polar opposite. Everytime is a small, lost piano ballad that fed into the tabloid drama of Britney and her ex, Justin Timberlake (it played out as a response to Timberlake\u2019s magnificent Cry Me a River, released the previous year). Its video all but depicted the singer killing herself in a bathtub (implying also that the paparazzi are as much to blame as her breakup). Its fragility is disarming. Despite its sparseness, Everytime still has production tricks up its sleeve (courtesy of Bj\u00f6rk collaborator Guy Sigsworth): strange clicks and swells, burbling beneath the piano line, create a womb-like atmosphere. It\u2019s a rare pop hit that seizes attention by shrinking further away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Britney\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Aguardianmusic%3Aplaylist%3A1Fr4AP5FzOqMKomsw5XVsM\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>6. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wjH3e4wdKg\">Breathe on Me</a></h2> <p>Britney could never be described as a virtuoso vocalist, but her voice isn\u2019t a limitation so much as an oddity. It\u2019s doubtless one of the most distinctive, immediately recognisable sounds in the past two decades of pop, even if it has often sounded more robotic than human. It has also clearly been a producer\u2019s dream in its elasticity \u2013 but while many have found the most mileage in highlighting its alien qualities through distortion, Breathe on Me is a rare example of a producer (the otherwise unknown Mark Taylor) drawing out its latent beauty. Britney\u2019s breathiness might not be technically good singing, but paired here with a burbling house track, it\u2019s as sensual as she\u2019s ever been. The wordless exhalation that rises out of the whispered bridge is simply gorgeous.</p> <h2>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4FF6MpcsRw\">Piece of Me</a></h2> <p>\u201cDo you want a piece of me?\u201d snarls Britney, as though she\u2019s simultaneously coming on to her audience, wearily resigning herself to what the public wants of her and squaring up for a fight. The 2007 album <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/26/popandrock.shopping\">Blackout</a> is her masterpiece, a defiant statement of self that was released at the singer\u2019s most public nadir. The year leading up to the album had seen Britney shave her head, physically attack paparazzi and lose custody of her children. Three months after its release, worldwide audiences gawped in real time as she was stretchered from her house to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, sectioned and placed under the conservatorship of her father \u2013 a setup that is still ongoing nearly a decade later. The production and songwriting personnel on Blackout, from Bloodshy &amp; Avant to Danja to Keri Hilson, seemed to take Britney\u2019s public persona as a muse of sorts. Astounding production \u2013 abrasive, distorted, fragmented, pitch-shifted \u2013 combines with lyrics that veer from meta commentary to giving-the-finger hedonism. The result is to capture the character of a woman on the edge of her sanity. But Blackout is not a tragedy; it\u2019s the culmination of the story Britney started telling seven years earlier on Lucky. If that poignant-in-retrospect single was a hand reaching for help through the fourth wall, then Blackout \u2013 and particularly Piece of Me, probably its most representative cut \u2013 is a fist punching through it. \u201cI\u2019m Mrs Most Likely to Get on TV for Stripping on the Streets,\u201d Britney offers, over degraded bass, chicken squawks and finally a carefree whistle breakdown. Her head was a mess in 2007, but her message on Blackout was clear: this is what we did to her.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4FF6MpcsRw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u4FF6MpcsRw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>8. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp30_RrIWWg\">Hot As Ice</a></h2> <p>Blackout overflows with ridiculous aural confections, but Hot As Ice might be the strangest. It\u2019s a hallucinatory dance through a demented fairground of manically grinning ooh-aah-aah backing vocals that segue seamlessly into skewed gospel chants. Synth organs oscillate as Britney conveys the physical state of being unable to properly regulate your body temperature when under the influence.</p> <h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzU9OrZlKb8\">Till the World Ends</a></h2> <p>Britney rarely gets the credit for introducing dubstep to mainstream American pop with the wobble bass of 2007\u2019s Freakshow. So her embrace of its EDMed-up iteration brostep on 2011\u2019s Femme Fatale was less about trend-jacking and more about picking up where she left off. Post-Blackout, Britney has occupied a strange, nostalgic place in pop culture. Her ultra-manufactured style of pop stardom feels anachronistic in an era when fans demand at least a facade of authenticity from their artists, and it\u2019s arguable that this is a reaction to seeing what the industry did to stars like Britney in the first place. As for Britney, simply hearing her sounding blithe is always a relief, even when she\u2019s yearning for apocalypse. Till the World Ends was part of a mini-wave of memento mori club songs around this time that conflated the certainty of approaching death with the necessity of partying hard (think also Pitbull\u2019s Give Me Everything and Nicki Minaj\u2019s Starships). Even better is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAyLPNLxB9U\">the Femme Fatale remix</a> \u2013 sadly not on Spotify \u2013 on which Britney is so thoroughly streamlined into the song\u2019s gleaming bass that it\u2019s up to Ke$ha and Minaj to ramp up the hedonism. They\u2019re both at their most wilfully obnoxious: Ke$ha leans even further into her then trademark Auto-Tune with a vocal that comes as close to capturing the spirit of vomiting into a club toilet as any; Minaj shrieks about poultry and mimes sniffing coke, but most satisfyingly becomes the first rapper to rhyme \u201cBritney\u201d with \u201cpickney\u201d since Dizzee Rascal eight years previously on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tVNnABm5gI\">Seems 2 Be</a>. Partying is a messy business, but at least if there\u2019s an apocalypse you won\u2019t need to clean up.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzU9OrZlKb8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qzU9OrZlKb8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>10.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt8VYOfr8To\"> Work B**ch</a></h2> <p>\u201cCall me the bubb-lah!\u201d So much of Britney\u2019s material is lent extra meaning simply by being refracted through her own narrative, and Work B**ch is a prime example. On the one hand, it\u2019s a very silly RuPaul-goes-EDM banger that\u2019s at its most functional in the gym. But it\u2019s impossible to hear her exhortations to labour as separate from the system that created Britney Spears, the wealthy celebrity, the cautionary tale, the woman with a tortured relationship to autonomy. \u201cYou wanna live fancy? Live in a big mansion? Party in France? You better work, bitch,\u201d she snaps, dishing out capitalist advice from the inside. But Britney is simultaneously the star, the product and the victim of this brutal credo, and if there\u2019s a whip being cracked, it\u2019s the one that\u2019s been on her back for 17 years. One thing Work B**ch isn\u2019t: an office soundtrack. How to subvert a capitalist ethos that seems all-encompassing? Transform it into a club anthem, to be played somewhere where the only work happening is the dancing variety.</p>",

  "<p>Environmental groups have turned on the Obama administration over offshore oil and gas extraction, warning it puts whales and dolphins in peril and risks undermining the president\u2019s commitment to putting the brakes on climate change.<br></p> <p>Barack Obama, who recently called global warming an \u201cgenuine existential threat\u201d, has enjoyed largely solid support from green groups that have praised his leadership on the issue. But Obama\u2019s environmentalist allies are increasingly frustrated over federally approved fossil fuel drilling, just as the US president attempts to put the finishing touches on his climate legacy. </p> <p>On Wednesday, leases for oil and gas exploration across 23.8m acres of the Gulf of Mexico will be auctioned off to fossil fuel companies. A total of 218.94m acres, about double the size of California, will have been offered up for leases in federal waters <a href=\"http://www.boem.gov/Five-Year-Program-2012-2017/\">by the end of next year</a>, with further leasing planned by the government in a new five-year program that <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-announces-next-step-offshore-oil-and-gas-leasing-planning-process\">will extend this process</a>.</p> <p>In response, protesters stormed the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management\u2019s office in New Orleans on Tuesday, demanding the cancellation of the lease sales because of the link between climate change and the kind of flooding that has devastated large parts of Louisiana. Several protesters were arrested. </p> <p>\u201cWhile climate change affects everyone, communities of color and low-income communities continue to be hit hardest by the lasting impacts of climate disasters,\u201d said Anne Rolfes, founding director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade.</p> <p>\u201cThousands of oil spills, sinking lands and extreme weather creating turmoil for countless people. What more will convince the Obama administration to stop treating the Gulf like a sacrifice zone to fossil fuel interests?\u201d</p> <p>Another green group, the Center for Biological Diversity, is also ramping up its opposition to offshore drilling, <a href=\"http://biologicaldiversity.org/publications/papers/CriticalGulf_08-2016.pdf\">releasing a report</a> that found that burning all of the fossil fuels in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico would release a staggering 32.8bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p> <p>The group claimed that expanding drilling in the gulf is contrary to America\u2019s pledge to help <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris\">keep global temperatures to 1.5C</a> above pre-industrial times and risks unleashing more extreme weather, drought and sea level rise upon swathes of the US. </p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t address climate change while expanding drilling the gulf. This report shows that new oil and gas leasing in the gulf would be a carbon bomb that will deepen our climate crisis,\u201d said Kristen Monsell, oceans attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cPresident Obama needs to align his energy and climate policies before leaving office, starting in the gulf.\u201d</p> <p>In March, activists <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/gulf-coast-residents-crash-oil-lease-auction-chanting-shut-it-down-14679758e1ad#.vlk9d8ab0\">disrupted a lease sale in New Orleans</a>, chanting \u201cshut it down\u201d and brandishing banners in front of bidding companies. The action didn\u2019t disrupt the process, however, with BOEM now overseeing around 4,400 active leases in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>Conservationists are also fretting over the impact of oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic Ocean. While the federal government has ruled out any drilling off the eastern seaboard in the immediate future, seismic airgun blasting is still being pursued by companies in waters stretching from Delaware to Florida.</p> <p>Research from Duke University\u2019s Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab has been released as <a href=\"https://oceana.widencollective.com/c/zzdkabnk\">animated maps by green group Oceana</a>, showing that bottlenose dolphins, fin, humpback and sperm whales are all present in areas deemed suitable for the airgun testing.</p> <p><strong></strong>A number of <a href=\"http://usa.oceana.org/sites/default/files/75_marine_scientist_letter-_seismic.pdf\">leading marine scientists have warned</a> that airgun testing, where air is fired at the seabed to determine if oil or gas deposits reside there, can be extremely harmful to the ability of whales and dolphins to communicate with each other or find food. The Obama administration has been pressured to end the practice.</p> <p>\u201cThese maps confirm what we\u2019ve long feared, that dolphins and whales along the east coast are at risk from dangerous seismic airgun blasting for oil and gas,\u201d said Claire Douglass, campaign director at Oceana. </p> <p>\u201cHearing that whales and dolphins could be injured is one thing, but seeing the scale of the threat is another. President Obama should stop seismic airgun blasting and protect our coast.\u201d </p> <p>But fossil fuel companies have warned against any winding down of offshore drilling, claiming that it creates jobs and helps the US become less dependent on energy sources from other countries.</p> <p>\u201cIf we are going to continue to drive investment in America, create jobs, and provide affordable energy, we must look to the future,\u201d said said Louis Finkel, executive vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, which supports a US \u201cenergy renaissance\u201d by drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>This stance has been embraced by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has an <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/an-america-first-energy-plan\">\u201cAmerica first\u201d energy policy</a> that would drastically ramp up domestic coal, oil and gas production. His rival Hillary Clinton has promised a <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/climate/\">swift transition to clean energy sources</a> but has come under fire from progressives for her ties to the oil and gas industry and for leaving the door open to fracking.</p>",
  "<p>On the Croatian-Serbian border last September, I met a Syrian biomedical engineer called Mohammad who was trying to get to Germany. He\u2019d been beaten to it by his pet dog. The dog, Mohammad said, had a pet passport that allowed him to fly to Berlin. Mohammad himself had a human passport that had only let him get as far as Turkey.</p> <p>I thought of Mohammad\u2019s absurd situation when Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU\u2019s most senior official, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/national-borders-are-the-worst-invention-ever-says-ec-chief-jean-claude-juncker-a7204006.html\">said this week</a>: \u201cBorders are the worst invention ever made by politicians.\u201d Predictably, his throwaway line \u2013 made at a conference in Austria this week \u2013 sparked fury among Europe\u2019s nationalists. If any proud patriot still needed proof that the EU seeks to create a totalitarian super-state, this was it. \u201cBeyond parody,\u201d said a Ukip spokesman. \u201cMadness,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/702906/eu-border-checkpoints-juncker-worst-invention-ever-outrage\">summarised</a> the Daily Express. </p> <p>If Juncker had stopped at \u201cborders are the worst\u201d, perhaps he could have mitigated some of the damage. While he would still have rejected one of nationalism\u2019s most central concepts \u2013 the boundary between two sovereign states \u2013 at least he wouldn\u2019t have questioned the reality of the border itself. But by calling it an \u201cinvention\u201d, Juncker went a step further. Borders in his view are not just bad. They are fictitious.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I crossed the Croatian-Serbian border last year, there was nothing to mark where Serbia stopped and Croatia started</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For this oddly timed intervention, Juncker has been presented as a renegade. But his argument is in fact an old one. Anthropologists and historians of a certain political disposition have long maintained that borders and nationhood are relatively new constructs. In his book, Imagined Communities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/01/benedict-anderson\">Benedict Anderson</a> argues that the concept of a nation developed only after the invention of the printing press in the 15th century. Printed material led to a standardisation of language, Anderson writes, and encouraged readers to see themselves as part of a common national culture.</p> <p>Some scholars argue that the contemporary concept of nations constrained by borders began to crystallise only in 1648. It was then that Europe\u2019s major powers agreed to end the thirty years\u2019 war by signing the peace of Westphalia \u2013 an agreement that saw the signatories agree to respect each others\u2019 territorial sovereignty, a new concept that has become known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_sovereignty\">the Westphalian system</a>. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5c3e94519c96c766dd93101285f313b0ec36ef1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5c3e94519c96c766dd93101285f313b0ec36ef1/0_85_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thousands of migrants across the border between Croatia into Slovenia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thousands of migrants across the border between Croatia into Slovenia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even then, as William Maley writes in <a href=\"http://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/what-is-a-refugee/\">his new book, What is a Refugee?</a>, \u201cBorders except as formalistic markers of jurisdiction typically did not register prominently in the thinking of princes, not least because until the advent of modern systems of regulatory bureaucracy, rigorous border control was simply beyond the capacity of rulers.\u201d According to the deal, Maley continues, Europeans could still migrate from place to place. </p> <p>Tellingly, it would be centuries before the creation of many of the countries we now consider as immutable concepts. Germany and Italy only became united entities in the second half of the 19th century. Hungary, now one of Europe\u2019s keenest proponents of border protection, was less than a century ago part of a polyglot, multinational commonwealth, the Austro-Hungarian empire. Poland sits roughly 100 miles west of where it did 70 years ago. If an American says her ancestors are Polish, there\u2019s every chance they were born in what is now Lithuania. Meanwhile, one of the creators of the Westphalian system \u2013 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire\">the Holy Roman empire</a> \u2013 ironically no longer exists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/04/britain-failing-child-refugees-europe-help-them-fast\">Britain is still failing child refugees in Europe. We must help them \u2013 and fast | Alf Dubs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even today, borders often exist only as a concept, rather than the robust entities that politicians present them as. When I crossed the Croatian-Serbian border last autumn, a few hours before Mohammad the biomedical engineer, there was nothing that marked where Serbia stopped and Croatia started. On either side, there were identical fields of stubble. It was only when I looked on my GPS map \u2013 and saw how the blue dot showing my position had moved west of a slim black line \u2013 that I realised I\u2019d crossed into Croatia.</p> <p>Many borders also exist only in certain contexts \u2013 blocking the passage of people but not things. The majority of humans \u2013 or at least those of us born in the developing world \u2013 cannot legally cross most borders. But all of us can circumvent those same barriers by sending products, money, information, insults, emails, photographs, and ideas to almost any country on the planet.</p> <p>Are borders \u201cthe worst\u201d? That\u2019s a subjective debate. But objectively speaking, borders are definitely an invention.

  "<p>Yellowstone national park is finding new ways to manage tourism after visits <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/\">jumped</a> by almost 600,000 between 2014 and 2015. After 15 years of steady growth, last year\u2019s 4m visits was a tipping point, says park ranger Charissa Reid.</p> <p>The park expects the number to rise in 2016. July is likely to be the first million-visit month in the park\u2019s 144-year history.</p> <p>However, extra visitors have increased accidents between humans, animals, and the park\u2019s flora and fauna.</p> <p>Park rangers issued more than 52,000 resource violations last year. People broke thermal features, interacted with protected wildlife and relieved themselves in the park. DUIs and domestic violence inside the park also increased.</p> <p>The number of full-time staff at Yellowstone has remained static for over a decade, adding to problems. The NPS employed only 330 permanent and 406 seasonal Yellowstone staff last year.</p> <p>Some<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/news/16032.htm\"> incidents</a> have made headline news \u2013 a man who strayed 225 yards off a designated path and fell to his death in Yellowstone\u2019s Norris geyser basin and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.yellowstonepark.com/teen-gored-bison\">five people were gored</a> by bison. However, dying in Yellowstone is unlikely.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you consider we had 4 million visitors, I think we\u2019re doing pretty good,\u201d says Reid.</p> <p>Managing human behavior to maintain safety, prevent staff exhaustion and keep visitors happy is a daily challenge.</p> <p>A common disruptive human behavior at Yellowstone is an \u201canimal jam\u201d. This happens when people see a bear or a buffalo, or any other animal, and come to a full stop to jump from their cars.</p> <p>\u201cWe can always tell the difference between a bison jam and a bear jam, because at a bear jam doors are flung open,\u201d says Reid. \u201cPeople kind of lose it over bears in the park.\u201d</p> <p>Yellowstone needs better understanding of visitor behavior to help with management, says Reid. </p> <p>Animal biologists, law enforcement and printers in Yellowstone\u2019s sign shop are all involved in visitor management. \u201cWe are trying to engage everyone to find solutions,\u201d says Reid.</p> <p>Yellowstone has also hired a social scientist to study humans. He researches how visitors enter and exit through the park, and how they interact with park attractions.</p> <p>\u201cOur superintendent often says visitors are the least studied mammal in Yellowstone,\u201d says Reid. \u201cWe know more about bison biology than we know about park visitors.\u201d</p> <p>Increasing international visitors, use of social media and varied cultural expectations among visitors have all caused problems. </p> <p>The park has hired Mandarin-speaking park rangers to communicate with the increasing number of Chinese visitors. Animal warnings have been translated into 10 languages and more toilets have been installed. New barriers and signs stop tourists from wandering, and protections outside wolf and wildlife dens keep them safe.</p> <p>Reid acknowledges these are short-term solutions. Effective long-term solutions remain beyond park management\u2019s immediate control, buried in budgets, and stored in as yet unmined visitor data.</p> <p>In the meantime, visitors are part of the solution.</p> <p>Reid wants people to stay on paths and to refrain from taking selfies with animals. Bison may seem harmless from a distance, but they injure more people annually than any other animal in the park.</p> <p>Visitors need to heed warnings to keep 25 yards away from buffalo and other wildlife, and 100 yards away from wolves and bears. The park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">issues pamphlets</a> asking visitors to use pullouts to view wildlife. </p> <p>Literature suggests visiting during non-peak hours, before 9am and after 3pm. It also encourages people to explore the many alternative federal lands surrounding Yellowstone.</p> <p>Reid, who grew up in Yellowstone, says she knows why the wild and awe-inspiring park keeps visitors coming back. </p> <p>\u201cYou can still see predator and prey activity here,\u201d says Reid. \u201cWildfires still rage. These big processes \u2013 predation, wildfires, migration \u2013 are still active in Yellowstone. Sure, there are places to buy an ice cream cone in Yellowstone. But there are many more places, just 200 or 300 yards into the wilderness, where you very quickly realize you\u2019re a guest in a grizzly bear\u2019s house.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When the Ethiopian Olympic marathon medallist Feyisa Lilesa <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/ethiopian-olympic-medallist-feyisa-lilesa-seeks-asylum-after-marathon-protest-oromo-rio\" title=\"\">crossed his arms at the finish line</a>, the world asked what the symbol stood for. Little is known about the historical marginalisation and collective persecution of Lilesa\u2019s people, the Oromo of north-east Africa.</p> <p>Almost all Ethiopian runners come from the Oromia region; but the Ethiopian athletics federation is highly scornful of their Oromo identity.

Exactly what Lilesa did in Rio - and now he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/medallist-feyisa-lilesa-fails-to-return-to-ethiopia-after-olympics-protest\" title=\"\">has not returned to Ethiopia</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/medallist-feyisa-lilesa-fails-to-return-to-ethiopia-after-olympics-protest\">Medallist Feyisa Lilesa fails to return to Ethiopia after Olympics protest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At risk to his life, and at the sacrifice of his career, Lilesa was determined to express at the Olympics the collective grievances and institutional discrimination his people suffer in the Oromia region. The courageous crossing of his arms is a gesture of solidarity with the Oromo protest symbol that has been used over the last nine months in defiance of the ruling regime. In a short interview, Lelisa told what many believe is the story of the Oromo: the killings, the maimings, arbitrary detentions, profiling, enforced disappearances and economic injustices perpetrated by the Ethiopian government against the Oromo nation.</p> <p>The current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/dozens-shot-dead-in-anti-government-protests-across-ethiopia-says-opposition\" title=\"\">social and political crisis in Ethiopia</a> was triggered by the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/14/ethiopia-addis-master-plan-abandoned\" title=\"\"> Addis Ababa \u201cmaster plan\u201d</a>, which was perceived by protesters as an attempt to remove the Oromo from the capital city. Even though it later dropped plans for this land grab, the regime claimed that its intention was to develop the city\u2019s business district by further moving into the Oromo territories and neighbouring districts. No prior consultation, discussion or deliberation was had with the Oromo people, the ancestral owners of the land. Some saw this as being part of a grand scheme to ensure the long-term hegemony of the regime\u2019s favoured ethnic group over the rest of the country. The Tigray, the regime\u2019s dominant group, make up only 6% of the country\u2019s population.</p> <p>As Lilesa\u2019s protest drew national attention, the situation in Ethiopia appeared to be deteriorating and having a serious impact on internal stability. It also cast a shadow of political uncertainty over the country.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The UN has highlighted how Ethiopian military and police forces systematically targeted certain ethnic groups</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Contemporary experiences teach us that economic and political inequality increases the risk of internal strife.

A heterogeneous society such as Ethiopia, where disparities in wealth overlap with ethnic grievances, is a good case study.</p> <p>The scale of the Oromo protest over the last nine months has exposed Ethiopia\u2019s ethnic-coded wealth distribution.

Not all Ethiopians have benefited equally from the country\u2019s economic growth.</p> <p>The Oromia region, the nation\u2019s agricultural breadbasket, is also the nation\u2019s second poorest region in the federation. According to the 2014 MPI, about 90% of Oromo live in severe poverty and destitution, more than 80% of Oromo households do not have access to electricity or sanitation and more than 75% of Oromo do not have access to potable drinking water.

An estimated 20,000 or more people have been imprisoned, tens of thousands wounded and disappeared; many more rendered landless, homeless and jobless.</p> <p>Now, with rallies taking place and with funerals in several corners of Oromia and Amhara lands, the conflict is likely to escalate and the country\u2019s public security and stability to deteriorate. As reports continue to emerge, after several days of internet and social media blackout in the country, there is a growing fear that the regime has, knowingly or not, helped foment inter-ethnic conflict, pitting the Tigray against the Oromo and Amhara peoples. In fact, given the differences among ethnic groups, this could quickly descend into a large-scale conflict.</p> <p>If there is any lesson the world can learn from Rwanda\u2019s genocide, it is the pressing need to act as swiftly as possible to avoid this kind of worst-case scenario. Lilesa\u2019s gesture is a request to the citizens of the world to stand with the Oromo in their quest for political and economic survival against the unjust face of Ethiopia. It is also a call for the western powers to re-evaluate their foreign policy towards Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa in the interests of real security, dignity, stability, peace and development for all the people \u2013 not a select few.</p>",

  "<p>Over the summer I\u2019ve watched France spinning itself into a frenzy over the clothes that Muslim women wear at the beach. The burkini has been banned in cities across the Mediterranean coast, and a woman was <a href=\"http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20160822.OBS6680/siam-verbalisee-sur-une-plage-de-cannes-pour-port-d-un-simple-voile.html\">fined \u20ac11</a> last week for wearing a simple headscarf and leggings on the beach in Cannes. This week pictures have emerged of French police<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/french-police-make-woman-remove-burkini-on-nice-beach\"> forcing a woman to remove clothing on Nice beach</a> as part of the ban. The prime minister, Manuel Valls, has supported the policing of Muslim women and their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/13/french-pm-ban-islamic-headscarves-universities-manuel-valls\">choice of dress</a> and hysterical articles on the subject are still coming thick and fast.</p> <p>This is just the latest battleground where France\u2019s Muslim population have had their choices scrutinised and restricted by a government that claims to protect the value of freedom of expression. The same heated debate led to women and girls being banned from wearing headscarves in schools, and over the past few years there have been strong calls to extend the ban to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/13/french-pm-ban-islamic-headscarves-universities-manuel-valls\">universities as well</a> \u2013 calls that may well come into effect soon if Valls has anything to do with it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/i-created-the-burkini-to-give-women-freedom-not-to-take-it-away\">I created the burkini to give women freedom, not to take it away | Aheda Zanetti</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The danger that Muslims pose to the French way of life is clearly of great concern to the French media and politicians, many of whom have expressed concerns about the incompatibility of Islam with core French values, most specifically, that of <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/can-the-french-talk-about-race\">la\u00efcit\u00e9</a> or secularism. Sweeping generalisations are made, with no official statistics or evidence to back them up. But even if anyone tried to look for data, the French interpretation of la\u00efcit\u00e9 would prevent them from finding it.</p> <p>This is because the French system interprets secularism not only as the separation of religion from the state, but also as an artificial way of claiming equality for all citizens. In an effort to maintain this idea of equality, it\u2019s technically illegal to<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/can-the-french-talk-about-race\"> collect data about ethnicity or religion</a> as we do here in the UK. To do so in France would be seen as a form of discrimination in itself.</p> <p>If equality is assumed and not monitored \u2013 in employment, the police force, stop-and-searches and higher education \u2013 that is a huge problem for minority communities. At a time when Islamophobia, police brutality against minorities and concerns about religious fanaticism are at a high, it makes sense to be collecting as much information about minority communities as possible. In Britain in the past month alone, we\u2019ve learned how there was a spike in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/11/police-blame-worst-rise-in-recorded-hate-on-eu-referendum\">race hate crime</a> during and after the Brexit referendum; and groundbreaking research has been released on the <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/our-work/news/widespread-inequality-risks-increasing-race-tensions-warns-ehrc\">levels of racial inequality</a> in the UK. How are French authorities supposed to tackle issues that have been identified as being concerns in Muslim and black communities if they only choose to recognise the existence of these communities in exceptional circumstances?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Why ban burkinis?\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftheguardian%2Fvideos%2F551124101742024%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=400&amp;height=400\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" style=\"max-width:400px;max-height:400px\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe> <figcaption>Why ban burkinis? </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Integration is seen to be a clear cause for concern in France. Along with social exclusion, unemployment and disenfranchisement, it\u2019s often highlighted as a contributing factor in the rise of jihadism. Surely the authorities should be able to explore these areas and collect official statistics to inform their counter-terrorism projects? Newspapers seem to have a very clear idea about the profile of young French jihadis and are quick to reference their origins, their history in the French prison system and their link to religion \u2013 and yet the state doesn\u2019t seem to regard it as a priority to try to obtain official figures that may help them to understand the issues that may lead to individuals being radicalised.</p> <p>And la\u00efcit\u00e9 is not just a problem for French Muslims, it affects all minorities. Schemes and projects that could be targeted to improve integration and equality of opportunity for different racial groups are being hindered.</p> <p>French politician Nadine Morano caused outrage last year after she described France as \u201ca Jewish-Christian country \u2026 of white race, which takes in foreigners\u201d. Many people pointed out that this statement was at odds with the idea of la\u00efcit\u00e9, but I found it more shocking that she denied the very belonging of non-white communities in France.</p> <p>Many of its black and Arab communities are descended from inhabitants of its former colonies. Their forefathers fought for the French in both world wars. Even if their families have only been living in France for one or two generations, their relationship with the country goes back much further. And their cultures and religions are not going to be erased simply by banning burkinis or the hijab.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/12/france-brand-secularism-laicite-marine-le-pen\">Now more than ever, it is time to stand up for France\u2019s brand of secularism | Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m often told that the colonial history France has with Algeria is no longer relevant, and that things have long since moved on, but my own experience tells me otherwise. At a house party in Paris one French guy asked me what my origins were. When I told him of my Algerian roots he responded, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we used to own your country.\u201d On a different occasion I had a guy drunkenly explain to me that if France had never colonised Algeria my family and I would still be sitting on the floor eating with our hands, and that France had brought civilisation to the \u201csavages in north Africa\u201d. I\u2019ve been singled out by the police as a white colleague next to me appeared invisible to them. The list goes on, and I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like if I were more visibly Muslim.</p> <p>While the nation feigns blindness to its diverse communities, tensions between them and the rest of the population are steadily increasing. With the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/14/front-national-france-elections-marine-le-pen-laurent-fabius-climate-deal\">rise of the far-right Front National</a> and increased concerns about immigration, the pollsters Ipsos conducted a survey to assess racist tendencies in France. For simply asking questions related to race they were condemned, and even threatened with being sued.</p> <p>Until recent decades, many Latin American countries promoted \u201cmestizo\u201d or \u201cmixed\u201d national identities that claimed to recognise diversity but in reality didn\u2019t recognise the significant black and indigenous communities, or allow them to claim their rights. The ideology of mestizaje in practice serves to assimilate Afro-descendants and indigenous peoples, denying their cultures and ignoring their historic contributions to their nations.</p> <p>It feels like a similar thing is happening in France. La\u00efcit\u00e9 should in theory promote social harmony between different groups in a multicultural, multi-faith society; but in practice it\u2019s being invoked as the reason for policing Muslims\u2019 day-to-day lives and suppressing their ability to express their faith.</p> <p>If France really does hold freedom of expression as a sacred value then now, more than ever, it needs to reflect on how it can build bridges with its minority communities and bring about a more tolerant interpretation of secularism.</p>",

This is, of course, if you don\u2019t count Australia as part of Asia.

First up, it\u2019s Manchester City\u2019s 2002-03 vintage, which featured Ali Benarbia (Algeria), Paulo Wanchope (Costa Rica), Sun Jihai (China), Danny Tiatto (Australia) and Argentina\u2019s Vicente Matias Vuoso, who famously never played a game for Kevin Keegan\u2019s team. Fresher in the collective consciousness are last season\u2019s champions, Leicester City, who regularly fielded Riyad Mahrez (Algeria), Wes Morgan (a Jamaican international), Argentina\u2019s Leo Ulloa and Japan\u2019s Shinji Okazaki, and also had Australia\u2019s Mark Schwarzer on their books.</p> <p>Moving from the East Midlands to East Lancashire, Adam Wilson recalls Mark Hughes\u2019s work at Blackburn. \u201cI would like to nominate the Blackburn Rovers squad of 2007-08,\u201d Adam says. \u201cOn their books were Benni McCarthy and Aaron Mokoena of South Africa, Christopher Samba of the Republic of Congo, Paraguay\u2019s Roque Santa Cruz, Brad Friedel of the USA, Jason Roberts of Grenada and New Zealand\u2019s Ryan Nelsen.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"614dc4da67ddabe3abbe6e71cfd73a659b815b30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/614dc4da67ddabe3abbe6e71cfd73a659b815b30/461_80_4435_2661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unsurprisingly, New Zealand international Ryan Nelsen features more than once.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unsurprisingly, New Zealand international Ryan Nelsen features more than once.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As for an Asian player to complete the set, it\u2019s a little trickier. \u201cZurab Khizanishvili is from Georgia, a UEFA member but in what is traditionally considered Asia, while Turkey\u2019s Tugay is from Trabzon, which is in Asiatic Turkey\u201d. Then there\u2019s Brett Emerton of Australia, a member of the AFC but not part of the Asian continent.</p> <p>Decide if they count amongst yourselves; the rest of us are heading off to Belgium. \u201cLast season\u2019s Belgian champions Club Brugge had players from every continent in their squad, says Stijn. \u201cThey had Mali\u2019s Abdoulay Diaby, Costa Rica\u2019s Oscar Duarte, Brazil\u2019s Claudemir, Israel\u2019s Lior Refaelov and Australia\u2019s Bernie Ibini-Isei.</p> <p>From Bruges to Bavaria, where Douglas Wright and Clayton Freeman both nominate FC Ingoldstadt, who have Marvin Matip (Cameroon), Mathew Leckie (Australia), Alfredo Morales (USA), Dar\u00edo Lezcano (Paraguay) on their books, plus two men from Asian countries that play within UEFA: Almog Cohen (Israel) and Konstantin Engel (Kazakhstan).</p> <p>Over to the MLS, where Benjamin Stormo and Dan Ryazansky both nominate the 2013 New York Red Bulls, featuring many US players, plenty of Europeans including Thierry Henry, a handful of South Americans including Brazil\u2019s Juninho (the Lyon one, not the Middlesbrough one), as well as DR Congo-born Peguy Luyindula, Australia\u2019s Tim Cahill, and Kosuke Kimura of Japan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffe26d5667ab0f91662d29509bd6b15d3668a7a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffe26d5667ab0f91662d29509bd6b15d3668a7a6/0_72_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thierry Henry was part of a cosmopolitan line-up at the New York Red Bulls.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thierry Henry was part of a cosmopolitan line-up at the New York Red Bulls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Stobe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All fit the bill, but we\u2019re still searching for a sextet of players from each of the continental confederations \u2013 and it turns out there are two recent examples from the Premier League, although sadly, both sides finished at the bottom.</p> <p>First, Russell Yong nominates the 2008-09 West Brom side, which featured Youssouf Mulumbu (DR Congo), Juan Carlos Menseguez (Argentina), Kim Do-heon (South Korea), Chris Wood (New Zealand) and Sheldon Martis \u2013 then of Netherlands-Antilles, now of Curacao.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s Ben Wright, who suggests QPR\u2019s 2012-13 squad, which included players from each confederation. In October 2012, Harry Redknapp named J\u00falio C\u00e9sar (Brazil), Adel Taarabt (Morocco), Park Ji-Sung (South Korea), Junior Hoilett (Canada), Ryan Nelsen (New Zealand) and (among others) England\u2019s Bobby Zamora in his team for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/mar/03/queens-park-rangers-everton-premier-league\">the 1-1 draw with Everton</a> \u2013 the clearest example we\u2019ve found of a starting eleven with a player from each continent, and each confederation.</p> <h2>League Cup woe </h2> <p><strong>\u201cPlymouth Argyle have progressed from the first round of the League Cup three times since 1992. Do any other clubs have a more miserable record in the competition?\u201d demands James Dart.</strong></p> <p>Well, not quite James \u2013 although Paul Fulcher makes a compelling case for AFC Wimbledon perhaps having the worst record, percentage-wise, since rejoining the top four tiers.</p> <p>\u201cIn their AFC incarnation, Wimbledon have spent six years in the Football League and never progressed beyond the first round,\u201d begins Paul. </p> <p>\u201cIndeed in their first Football League season, 2011-12, they didn\u2019t even get as far as the first round, being knocked out in a preliminary round, necessitated by the complication of Birmingham getting both relegated to the Championship and qualifying for Europe. That is one of only two such preliminary rounds ever played, the other was in 2002-03. The original Wimbledon, before the Milton Keynes fiasco, had actually reached two semi-finals and two quarter-finals in their last nine years of existence.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f6d16dbb80915a32879a674a3f2cdeff1a1f5eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f6d16dbb80915a32879a674a3f2cdeff1a1f5eb/270_323_1974_1185/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peterborough\u2019s Tom Nichols scores in injury time to condemn AFC Wimbledon to another League Cup first round exit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peterborough\u2019s Tom Nichols scores in injury time to condemn AFC Wimbledon to another League Cup first round exit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ProSports/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here\u2019s another side with a mixed record in what\u2019s now known as the EFL Cup: \u201cIn 2006-07, Wycombe miraculously managed to get to the League Cup semi-finals despite residing in League Two, defeating Fulham <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/dec/20/match.charltonathletic\">and Charlton</a> (both in the Premier League at the time) along the way before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jan/24/match.chelsea\">succumbing 5-1 on aggregate</a> to Chelsea,\u201d says Andrew Styles.</p> <p>\u201cThey have followed this up by progressing from the first round only once in the past ten seasons, including becoming one of Plymouth\u2019s rare first round victims in 2007-08.\u201d The Chairboys continued their barren run this season, losing 1-0 to Bristol City.</p> <h2>Knowledge archive</h2> <p><strong>\u201cI seem to remember a story in the Spanish press when Mohamed Sissoko was at Valencia which said that he told his manager on international week that he had been called up, when this was totally untrue,\u201d</strong> writes Bill MacLachlan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/aug/23/theknowledge.sport\">in August 2006</a>.<strong>\u201dApparently he even had the cheek to say he scored a goal in the match. Is this true and are there any other funny stories of players skiving when they should be at matches?\u201d</strong></p> <p>Oh it\u2019s true, Bill. Well, sort of. After a World Cup qualifier against Senegal last September, the Mali international told Valencia he\u2019d be staying at home to play in a friendly against Kenya. Upon his return, he revealed that he\u2019d played 48 minutes in a 1-0 win (he wasn\u2019t cheeky enough to claim the goal for himself, as that would be a bit <em>too</em> implausible), a declaration that turned out to be a big fib - he\u2019d actually been in Paris visiting his father, who was ill in hospital. When Claudio Ranieri, then manager of Valencia, discovered the deceit he saw the funny side and told Sissoko that the club would have happily given him the time off anyway.</p> <p>More recently, former France international Youri Djorkaeff found himself with some explaining to do for bunking off when he told club officials at New York Red Bulls that he had to return to France to attend to a serious family matter. The domestic crisis in question? Enthusiastically celebrating France\u2019s World Cup quarter-final win over Brazil in Frankfurt, Germany, where he was caught by TV cameras.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Stoke striker Sammy Bangoura ended an unexplained 37-day absence and returned to the club having missed pre-season training. Rumoured to have been at home in his native Guinea, Bangoura\u2019s absence infuriated the Potters so much that they stopped paying his wages while he was away. The 24-year-old striker - twice previously late returning to the club from Guinea - eventually reported for duty the day before Stoke\u2019s season opener at Southend, claiming that an immigration wrangle involving his five-month-old daughter had caused the delay.</p> <h2>...and a bonus Knowledge archive update!</h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s odd timing that you returned to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/10/football-teams-who-had-cigarette-brands-as-a-shirt-sponsor\">the most goals scored on a debut</a> a couple of weeks ago,\u201d begins Colin Carter.</p> <p>\u201cWhile bored at work, I was reading up on Vincent Janssen, and stumbled across the story of Johan Voskamp. His first game for Sparta Rotterdam in 2010 was against Almere City (who Janssen joined in 2013) in the Dutch second division. Sparta won 12-1 and Voskamp scored eight goals \u2013 which has to be up there with the best debuts ever.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqxZyx-iCh4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VqxZyx-iCh4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Johan Voskamp scores eight goals on his debut.</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Can you help?</h2> <p>\u201cSince Wycombe Wanderers sold local boy Matt Ingram to QPR last season, we have had a, shall we say, \u2018fluid\u2019 goalkeeping situation. So much so that in our last five league games (carried over from the 15-16 season), we have played five different keepers. The roll of honour is as follows: <strong>Benjamin Siegrist </strong>(on loan from Aston Villa) played against Accrington; <strong>Ryan Allsop</strong> (on loan from Bournemouth) played on the last day against Oxford; new signing <strong>Scott Brown</strong> played in our first game of this season at Crawley but sustained a groin injury; <strong>Cameron Dawson </strong>(emergency loan from Sheffield Wednesday) played against Grimsby, but Wycombe and Wednesday couldn\u2019t agree on an extension, so <strong>Jamal Blackman </strong>joined on loan from Chelsea in time for the next game, against Accrington. Can any other clubs match this rate of turnover for goalkeepers?\u201d \u2013 Bill Sheppard.</p> <p>\u201cAfter seeing Italian side Sassuolo win 3-0 against Red Star Belgrade on their European debut, I thought I would check their Wikipedia entry. I noticed that one of their previous managers, Alberto Malesani, had failed to win a single game in any of his last three management posts (the other two being Genoa and Palermo). Is this a record?\u201d \u2013 Robin Tucker.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is the most number of goals scored by a single player in consecutive games without another player in the same team getting on the scoresheet during said period?\u201d \u2013 Liam Ward.</p> <p>\u201cNewcastle played Bristol City, managed by Lee Johnson, on Saturday, and play Cheltenham tonight, who are managed by his dad, Gary. Are there any other examples of famous father-son managers playing against the same opposition consecutively?\u201d \u2013 Paul Harte.</p> <p>\u201cYannick Bolasie has played against West Brom in his first two matches of the season \u2013 for Crystal Palace on the opening day, and for Everton last Saturday. Surely this is a first?\u201d \u2013 Rafi Addlestone.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Send your questions and answers to <a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\">knowledge@theguardian.com</a> or tweet<a href=\"https://twitter.com/theknowledge_gu\">@TheKnowledge_GU</a></strong></p>",

The city is constrained by mountains and the ocean but has steadily <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/about-us/history\">grown</a> since the gold rush, attracting agriculture and commercial fishing along with a vibrant resort community and tourism industry.</p> <p>Housing development has not kept pace with the growth of the population, which is now 62,000 in the city and 270,000 total in Santa Cruz County. The county has added roughly one housing unit for every 10 new residents in recent years, according to county housing manager Julie Conway.</p> <p>At the same time, the top five occupations in the area are low-wage jobs in retail, food service and cleaning, paying between $9.06 and $11.30 an hour, according to 2015 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://workingfordignity.sites.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/192/2015/11/Working-For-Dignity-Final-Report.pdf\">research</a>.

  "<p>The Labour party should continue to campaign against Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union and a public vote should be held on the terms of any replacement trade deal before article 50 is invoked, Owen Smith has said. </p> <p>Smith, who is challenging Jeremy Corbyn for the leadership of the party, said a new referendum or a general election should be held to confirm the details of the post-Brexit deal before Britain begins the process of formally leaving the trading bloc.</p> <p>He accused leave campaigners of lying about the benefits of leaving the EU, and reiterated his complaint that Corbyn had failed to argue strongly enough in support of the union. And he said that under his leadership Labour MPs would vote against any attempt to invoke article 50, the exit clause of the EU\u2019s Lisbon treaty, until a second public vote is secured.</p> <p>He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI\u2019m saying that we didn\u2019t actually know what we were voting on. Theresa May says \u2018Brexit means Brexit,\u2019 but in my view we were fibbed to about the extra money for the NHS \u2013 there is no extra \u00a3350m \u2013 [and] we were fibbed to about the suggestion there were going to be easy answers on immigration. There are not.\u201d</p> <p>Smith has made support for the EU a key plank of his Labour leadership campaign, in which there have been few other points of disagreement between him and the incumbent. Both men have advanced a broadly centre-left agenda, with policies including renationalisation of the railways, increased public spending and enhanced workers\u2019 rights. </p> <p>Corbyn has endured months of accusations from his political opponents that he failed to do enough to mobilise Labour supporters into the polling booths to vote remain. </p> <p>However, Smith has faced accusations of arrogance towards voters, who voted 52-48% in favour of leaving the EU in June. Challenged over his attitude on Today, he insisted that voters had not been told the full truth and that Britain faced an uncertain future on its own. </p> <p>\u201cI think we are seeing the Bank [of England] admitting last week that we are likely to go into a recession; they have had to put an extra \u00a360bn-worth of our money into QE [quantitative easing]; that there are going to be a quarter of a million jobs lost; that inflation is going to go up,\u201d Smith said.</p> <p>\u201cI still agree with the experts that things are going to be really bumpy. But the crucial point that I\u2019m trying to make \u2026 is that at the end of this, when we know what is really on offer, when Theresa May has done this negotiation \u2026 at that point we could put it back to the country, either in a second referendum or in a general election, in which under me Labour would be arguing that we should remain. </p> <p>\u201cI still fundamentally believe that we didn\u2019t fight hard enough, that Jeremy didn\u2019t fight hard enough. I still feel that we should stay in.\u201d<br></p>",

It came to me years ago when I realised that the only page of an assessment my manager ever read was the summary at the back.

  "<h2>Katmai national park, Alaska</h2> <p>Katmai, in southern Alaska, is for the bears: it\u2019s home to the world\u2019s largest population of Alaskan brown bears, a subspecies of the grizzly. Over 2,000 bears live in Katmai and thanks to their salmon-rich diet, they are some of the largest bears in the world, with mature males routinely reaching over 1,000 pounds (453kg), more than twice the size of the average Yellowstone grizzly. With the backcountry full of bears, people usually stay within a small section of the four-million-acre park. The most popular area is Brooks Camp, at the mouth of the Brooks river, on the shore of Nanak lake.<br></p> <p>Here hundreds of bears congregate in summer and autumn to feast on salmon, which pass through in July and September on their seasonal breeding migrations. From June to September, visitors can view the bears from wooden platforms along the river. Katmai national park is also home to some of the most active volcanoes in the world. The Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes is an ash-filled valley devastated by the largest volcanic eruption in the 20th century, which took place in June of 1912, when Mount Katmai and Novarupta erupted simultaneously, expelling an estimated 13-15 cubic kilometres of ash.</p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong> After viewing the brown bear feast at Brooks Camp, board one of the park buses for a tour through the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes. More than 100 years since the 1912 eruption, the smoking fumaroles are quiet, but creeks and rivers have carved canyons into the ash hundreds of feet deep and only a few feet wide, giving visitors a dramatic glimpse into the geologic layers of the eruption. <br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/katm/index.htm\"><em>Park website</em></a></p> <h2>Gates of the Arctic national park and preserve, Alaska</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d3d66b014c6958ecb624b632a6776d3b8ff379d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3d66b014c6958ecb624b632a6776d3b8ff379d6/0_0_5044_3350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walker Lake and Kobuk River in Gates of the Arctic National Park &amp; Preserve, Alaska\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Sitting above the Arctic Circle, Gates of the Arctic is the most northerly US national park and its second-largest, being slightly bigger than Belgium. With no roads and little development, the park tends to attract only the hardiest and most adventurous of travellers. The stunning, glacier-carved Brooks Range straddles the park, running east to west, along the Continental Divide. Water running down the southern slopes of the range flows to the Pacific, while water running off the northern side flows to the Arctic Ocean.</p> <p>Access is by way of the Dalton Highway, a primitive, sometimes unpaved road that runs from Fairbanks up to Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic Ocean, skimming the eastern border of the park. Entrance from the road means crossing the deep, cold, fast waters of the Middle Fork of the Koyukuk river without a bridge. Because of this natural barrier, most visitors are content with viewing the park from the road, on their way north.</p> <p>More determined visitors can arrange to be dropped off on one of the park\u2019s many lakes by a small seaplane. Another option is to fly to the airstrip at Anaktuvuk Pass, a Nunamiut village in the north-east of the park, home to around 350 people. Anaktuvuk Pass boasts the most remote post office in the US and its <a href=\"http://www.north-slope.org/departments/inupiat-history-language-and-culture/simon-paneak-memorial-museum\">Simon Paneak Memorial Museum</a> celebrates Nunamiut culture and displays artefacts related to the tribe\u2019s history of semi-nomadic caribou hunting.</p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong> The best strategy is to start at the park headquarters in Fairbanks and drive to the ranger station in Bettles, just south of the park. From there you can arrange for a plane to drop you off in the backcountry. Be sure to arrange for pick-up before your supplies run out. Summers are short and snowstorms can sweep in any month of the year. <br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gaar/index.htm\"><em>Park website</em></a></p> <h2>North Cascades national park, Washington state<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"992da8eee8d58a8337fce26e8b14ddef1eed8c4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/992da8eee8d58a8337fce26e8b14ddef1eed8c4b/0_0_5150_3224/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Female climber traversing snowy ridge, Redoubt Whatcom Traverse, North Cascades National Park, Washington state\" width=\"1000\" height=\"626\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Most of the least-visited parks are remote and hard to reach. But North Cascades is within 100 miles of Seattle and yet, in 2015 it had just under 27,000 visitors. The low numbers are probably due to limited road access. Highway 20 bisects it at Ross Lake, but the park, most of which is within the Stephen Mather Wilderness, has few other maintained roads.</p> <p>However, the lack of roads is part of what makes North Cascades special: this rugged expanse is virtually untouched, extending north into Canada, where it becomes the Skagit Valley provincial park. The promise of native wilderness lures experienced backpackers and mountaineers, who tramp the 18 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail that run through the park and seek out North Cascades\u2019 remote peaks, which have names like Mount Terror and Inspiration Peak.</p> <p>Most visitors come to Ross Lake national recreation area, a 12,000-acre manmade reservoir that bisects the park and provides power to Seattle through a series of hydroelectric dams. Fishing, canoeing, camping and kayaking are popular.</p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong> Cascade Pass was once an important trade route for Native Americans travelling between the coast and the interior. To retrace their historic footsteps, leave from the town of Marblemount and drive to the end of the Cascade river road. From there hike a moderate 3\u00bd miles to the pass, which at 1,643 metres is above the tree line, affording spectacular views. <br>\u2022<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/noca/index.htm\"> <em>Park website</em></a></p> <h2>Great Basin national park, Nevada</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"be6382d47e8b5e22d410d30d4d023fff61443092\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be6382d47e8b5e22d410d30d4d023fff61443092/0_138_5200_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rays of sun penetrate the clouds illuminating several bristlecone pine trees in the Wheeler Peak Grove in Great Basin National Park, Nevada\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Highway 50, running east to west through central Nevada\u2019s high desert, is nicknamed the Loneliest Road in America. So it\u2019s no surprise that one of the country\u2019s least-visited national parks lies along this road.</p> <p>Great Basin, in eastern Nevada, protects a small pocket of this state\u2019s famous \u201cbasin and range\u201d topography \u2013 created by deep-rooted forces pulling apart the continental crust, forming a series of parallel basins and mountain ranges across the state. Great Basin national park near the town of Baker, was created in part to protect a stand of bristlecone pine trees that are among the oldest living organisms on Earth, up to 5,000 years old.</p> <p>Key sights are Wheeler Peak, at 3,982 metres the second-tallest mountain in Nevada, and the Lehman caves, a complex of deep caverns known for their beautiful flowstone formations of stalactites, stalagmites, and helictites. Tours are offered several times a day by park rangers, covering the geology, ecology and history of the caves. The park also has two campsites and is known for its exceptionally dark night skies, perfect for stargazing.</p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong> The Grand Palace cave tour is 90 minutes long and explores underground treasures such as the Gothic Palace, the Music Room, the Lodge Room, Inscription Room, and the Grand Palace sections of Lehman Caves.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grba/index.htm\"><em>Park website</em></a></p> <h2>Black Canyon of the Gunnison national park, Colorado</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2c9421a1b0b651985e45340cdd01ff035e4ad58d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c9421a1b0b651985e45340cdd01ff035e4ad58d/0_0_5209_3126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Painted Wall, Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, Colorado\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is not the deepest canyon in North America but it is the steepest, with the Gunnison river falling more than 10 metres per mile as it plunges through this narrow national park in south-west Colorado (in comparison, the Colorado river drops an average of 2.3 metres per mile through the Grand Canyon).</p> <p>The name refers to the limited sunlight that reaches its depths, which are made even darker by the black Precambrian gneiss and schist rock of the canyon walls. This 1.7-billion-year-old rock is extremely hard and good for rock climbing, though scaling the steep, sheer walls should only be attempted by experts.</p> <p>Hiking from the rim into the canyon is not for the faint of heart, either. A number of routes descend from north and south rims, but the trails are unmarked and unmaintained, requiring route finding and Class 3 scrambling skills. Poison ivy also grows abundantly in the canyon, deterring even the most agile hikers.</p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong> The best views of the Black Canyon of the Gunnison are from Exclamation Point, an easy-to-moderate three-mile round trip hike on the north rim that leads to an overlook.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/blca/index.htm\"><em>Park website</em></a></p> <h2>Organ Pipe Cactus national monument, Arizona</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"51d0d7a45982d00aaa9d00dac95cc0b2618fcd7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51d0d7a45982d00aaa9d00dac95cc0b2618fcd7d/0_0_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Organ pipe, saguaro cacti, Ajo Range behind, Sonoran Desert, Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Arizona, USA\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This slice of the Sonoran desert biome is a vibrant desert habitat and the only place where the rare and stunning organ pipe cactus grows wild. Pollinated primarily by bats, this cactus has the heft and presence of the iconic saguaro cactus, but with many more arms snaking upwards from its central trunk. Many other species of cactus and plant also thrive here, with flowering cactuses making for stunning spring colours.</p> <p>One reason visitor numbers are low is because the park is on the border with Mexico, where drug smuggling and immigration issues are rampant. Incidents involving visitors are rare, but people are advised to stay on marked trails, not pick up hitchhikers and report suspicious activities to rangers or border patrol agents. The park has two campsites, one for RVs, the other for tents only.</p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong> Drive or cycle the 21-mile Ajo Mountain drive to the Arch Canyon trailhead.

That hardly seems enough room to support several hundred moose and a few dozen wolves, yet this island is home to one of the most thoroughly studied predator-prey interactions in the world.</p> <p>Since 1980, the animals have been tracked by biologists interested in how the rise and fall of moose on the island impacts the number of wolves. In harsh winters, the moose population dwindles to a few hundred, with the wolves dropping to around a dozen. In lush summers, as many as 1,000 moose and three dozen wolves have been counted. The island is considered a closed population, but both animals have been known to come and go, swimming across Lake Superior or crossing on the ice in winter.</p> <p>With such a rare and delicate predator-prey dynamic, the number of human visitors is limited. Wolves are shy: sightings are rare and interactions rarer. In the north-west corner of Lake Superior, the island can only be reached by boat or seaplane. Seasonal ferries operated by the national park service run from Houghton and Copper Harbor, Michigan, and Grand Portage, Minnesota. Camping is allowed in 36 backcountry sites, reachable by foot or boat. No vehicles are allowed on the island.</p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong> For a true wilderness backpacking experience, hike the Greenstone Ridge Trail, which runs for 40 miles from one end of the island to the other. It usually takes four to five days and hikers can arrange to be picked up by shuttle boat at the other end of the island. <br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/isro/index.htm\"><em>Park website</em></a></p> <h2>Congaree national park, South Carolina</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"939d38ce7bb9a9bba1d8abdff6d46bbd3737c8f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/939d38ce7bb9a9bba1d8abdff6d46bbd3737c8f3/0_0_4992_3328/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bald Cypress and willows on a foggy morning in Congaree National Park, South Carolina\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Deep in the swamps of southern South Carolina is one of the largest intact stands of old-growth hardwood trees in North America. In the late 1960s, private landowners were considering selling off tracts for timber development until the Sierra Club campaigned to have over 20,000 acres just south-east of Columbia declared a national monument in 1976. In 2003, the area was upgraded to national park status.</p> <p>The trees in Congaree are some of the tallest hardwoods in the world and the park is nicknamed the Redwoods of the East. The canopy height averages 30 metres and the park is home to at least 15 \u201cchampion trees\u201d, a title bestowed on the tallest known specimens of a species. These include a 49-metre sweet gum, a 47-metre cherry bark oak, a 41-metre American elm and a 38-metre laurel oak. These trees stand in a swampy flood plain forest that floods a few times of year.</p> <p>Because much of Congaree is swampy, the best way to explore it is by canoe. The Congaree River Blue Trail starts in the state capital, Columbia, and runs for 50 miles downstream. Paddlers may catch a glimpse of the park\u2019s abundant wildlife, including bobcats, river otters and a variety of bird species, many of which are unique to this forest.</p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong> Visitors can walk through the Congaree swamp without getting their feet wet on the 2.4-mile elevated Boardwalk Loop starting from the Harry Hampton Visitor Center in the north of the park. <br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cong/index.htm\"><em>Park website</em></a></p> <h2>Dry Tortugas national park, Florida</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"42fc2113f33dd083578224183362aa630f1c07f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42fc2113f33dd083578224183362aa630f1c07f0/0_0_5192_3114/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dry Tortugas, Garden Key Snorkling at Fort Jefferson, U.S.A., Florida,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>One way to keep a park from being overrun by visitors is to make it accessible only by boat. Dry Tortugas is 68 miles off the main Florida Keys. Named for an abundance of turtles (tortugas in Spanish) and lack of potable surface water, these westernmost and most isolated of the Keys have healthy populations of birds and sea turtles, who see only around 60,000 people a year.</p> <p>Dry Tortugas may belong to the turtles, but it\u2019s dominated by Fort Jefferson, a massive but unfinished fortress built in the late 1800. The fort is the largest masonry building in the western hemisphere and the cost of building and maintaining it in the face of hurricanes and harsh salty conditions could not be justified for long. After being used as a prison and medical quarantine facility, it was turned into a National Monument in 1935 and a national park in 1992.</p> <p>Dry Tortugas is reached by ferry, boat or seaplane from Key West. Most people come to snorkel or dive in the clear blue waters around the thriving coral reefs. Others come with food, water and supplies to camp under the stars in the primitive campsite near the fort.</p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong> In April and May, migrating sea birds fly over Dry Tortugas, often landing for a rest on the island. Species counts during these flyovers are legendary, with 100 or more species sometimes spotted in a single day. <br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/drto/index.htm\"><em>Park website</em></a></p> <h2>National Park of American Samoa<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"511cdac03f8ec7a6e7004e559c35ba010c78d9bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/511cdac03f8ec7a6e7004e559c35ba010c78d9bd/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A secluded tropical sand beach and fringing reef in the Samoa National Park in Ofu Island, American Samoa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This park, in the South Pacific, nearly 5,000 miles from the California coast, has long been a strategic military outpost for the US. Three of the islands \u2013 Tutuila, Ofy and Ta\u2019u \u2013 were declared a national park in 1988. Only around 10,000 visitors make their way here each year.</p> <p>American Samoa is made up of overlapping shield volcanoes erupted from an underwater hot spot that has been active for at least 1.5 million years. As the Pacific plate moved over this hot spot, it created an island chain, much like the islands of Hawaii. The volcanoes are not currently erupting, but are still considered active. Periodic collapses of parts of the shield volcanoes can set off tsunamis and leave behind sea cliff scars over 900 metres high, forming some of the highest sea cliff escarpments in the world.</p> <p>Visitors come to American Samoa mainly for snorkelling and whale watching. The waters are rich in marine life, including sea turtles, humpback whales, over 900 species of fish and 250 species of coral. Some of the largest living coral colonies are found in the waters around Ta\u2019u Island.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/aug/25/10-best-places-to-stay-us-national-parks\">Where to stay in the 10 most popular US national parks</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Top tip</strong> The Samoan culture is one of the oldest in Polynesia and still thriving on American Samoa.

  "<p>There is a scene in White Girl, the first feature directed by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2559080/\">Elizabeth Wood</a>, in which Leah, the heroine, visits a lawyer after her boyfriend is busted for drug dealing. Leah, a college student, is broke, high and in a state of shambolic collapse most of the time, but she is also a middle-class girl with certain expectations of the world, one of which is that if you get into trouble, you throw yourself at the nearest man who looks like your dad and everything gets better from there. That it doesn\u2019t work out in this case is less interesting to the film-maker than the meaning of that expectation itself.</p> <p>Wood, 33, is sitting opposite me in a cafe in downtown Manhattan, where she lives with her husband and two-year-old son, many miles from the New York neighbourhood in which the film is set. White Girl \u2013 the title is also slang for cocaine \u2013 draws heavily on Wood\u2019s experiences of moving to New York from Oklahoma 15 years ago, to take up a college place and do much of what Leah does in the movie: move to a crime-ridden Puerto Rican district where, the locals told her, they\u2019d \u201cnever seen a white girl, except for that one crackhead\u201d; set about partying herself into near oblivion, hanging out with small-time drug dealers and realising that, for the people living around her, the world worked completely differently \u2013 that is, without the \u201csafety net\u201d of racial advantage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49221fea835f0186dc6e5dbc7de6c8c98d3ed96f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49221fea835f0186dc6e5dbc7de6c8c98d3ed96f/113_121_1598_959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018In many ways she\u2019s the bad guy\u2019 \u2026 Morgan Saylor with Brian Marc in White Girl.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In many ways she\u2019s the bad guy\u2019 \u2026 Morgan Saylor with Brian Marc in White Girl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR image/PR Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The film, which attracted attention at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sundancefilmfestival\">Sundance</a>, asks a lot of good questions about race, class and gender discrimination, but if it causes a firestorm when it comes out on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix\">Netflix</a> later this year, it will be because of the sex scenes \u2013 there is a lot of teenage shagging in the backs of cars, up against walls and in club toilets. </p> <p>None of these scenes, for which the film has drawn inevitable comparisons to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/22/harmony-korine-kids-20th-anniversary\">Harmony Korine\u2019s Kids</a>, feel angled to shock, with the exception of a rape scene that is by necessity brutal. The reason for this, apart from the subtlety of the script, is <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2838320/\">Morgan Saylor</a>, best known for her role as Dana Brody in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/homeland\">Homeland</a>, who is spectacular as Leah, by turns silly, naive, infuriatingly childish, compassionate and brave. In a lesser film, she might have been a 2D vehicle for Wood\u2019s desire to tell off the world, but instead she\u2019s a complex figure: neither wholly exploiter nor victim. Her idiocy has dire consequences for her boyfriend, so that, says Wood, \u201cin many ways she\u2019s the bad guy\u201d. But the price she pays for it is so steep it is hard not to sympathise.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXDr-mZkRTQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zXDr-mZkRTQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The male lead, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6891629/\">Brian Marc</a>, is a Puerto Rican singer who\u2019d barely acted before he won the role and plays the drug dealer, Blue, with a subtle and heartbreaking brilliance, while his buddy, played by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6853061/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\">Anthony Ramos</a>, is currently wowing audiences nightly on stage in the Broadway hit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/hamilton\">Hamilton</a>.

Instead, she is writing of the specific experience of coming to New York from the middle of the country and promptly losing one\u2019s head, a form of self-indulgence she understands well. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for kids who come from very stable backgrounds to take these risks than kids who grew up used to these things and don\u2019t see the allure.\u201d</p> <p>Wood\u2019s parents \u2013 father a psychologist, mother a speech therapist \u2013 are stalwart members of the Church of Christ, where her father is a minister. Wood relays this information with a smile that acknowledges the discomfort she has put them through, over the years. (When her parents saw the film for the first time at Sundance, Wood felt obliged to issue an advance warning: \u201cDad, about seven minutes in there\u2019s a blow job.\u201d) They have the advantage, she says, of having a good sense of humour and also being the most liberal people in the church. \u201cThey support everything I do and hug and smile and are my biggest cheerleaders. But still.\u201d</p> <p>A result of this stability in her background was to make her go even more crazy in her late teens and early 20s. In Wood\u2019s case, she did well at school but also partied hard so that, she says, \u201cmy mum was convinced I was not going to graduate from high school. I remember her saying, \u2018Life is not a party!\u2019 Then the next day I was valedictorian and gave a speech.

Everyone was always outside; there were barbecues and ice cream, and we were struggling students and we had this nice apartment.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m trying to examine my privilege, and this may leave a bad taste in people of colour\u2019s mouths</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wood hung out with the guys on the street and her then roommate, with whom she is still good friends, had a baby with the man she was then dating. Everything contrived to keep them apart, which Wood would later use in the film. \u201cThe judicial system, economic and family background, just logistics of how you can move around in this world. It\u2019s like Romeo and Juliet: there was no way these two people were going to be together, even if they wanted to be. There was no way these kids could figure it out.\u201d</p> <p>The rape scene, which was informed by the experience of a friend, is shot in such as way as to convey the rapist\u2019s corrupt logic: the rationale of, \u201cWe\u2019re wasted, we\u2019re partying, this is what we were going to do anyway.\u201d That idea \u2013 of flirtation being read as an unspoken invitation to have sex \u2013 is one that, says Wood, \u201cI know in my life has happened millions of times and it\u2019s the same for many women. \u2018I didn\u2019t think I was promising to sleep with you! I thought I was just having a good time! I thought I was in control of this situation!\u2019 But there are moments when you find yourself where you\u2019ve gotten too far.\u201d</p> <p>It is with dry amusement that Wood acknowledges the rape scene as yet another plot point in a film already overloaded with things that could \u201cgo wrong and offend people\u201d. For a first feature, she has picked a story that throws up just about every flashpoint, save for abortion, in US contemporary culture. The way Wood got around her anxiety about this was through prep and more prep. She had to be absolutely sure she knew what she was trying to say, before anyone else jumped aboard to accuse her of saying it wrong. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m trying to start a conversation, ask questions, I\u2019m trying to examine my privilege, and this may leave a bad taste in people of colour\u2019s mouths: \u2018Oh, you\u2019re trying to examine it?

But even now, she finds it useful to remove herself and see a scene from above. \u201cDo I do things for a story? I don\u2019t know. Maybe I just like excitement. Yesterday, construction workers were harassing me. They weren\u2019t being rude, but they were engaging with me, calling after me, and I started filming them, which I always do.

  "<p>At the heart of this spellbinding book is a simple but chilling idea: human nature will be transformed in the 21st century because intelligence is uncoupling from consciousness. We are not going to build machines any time soon that have feelings like we have feelings: that\u2019s consciousness. Robots won\u2019t be falling in love with each other (which doesn\u2019t mean we are incapable of falling in love with robots). But we have already built machines \u2013 vast data-processing networks \u2013 that can know our feelings better than we know them ourselves: that\u2019s intelligence. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google\">Google</a> \u2013 the search engine, not the company \u2013 doesn\u2019t have beliefs and desires of its own. It doesn\u2019t care what we search for and it won\u2019t feel hurt by our behaviour. But it can process our behaviour to know what we want before we know it ourselves. That fact has the potential to change what it means to be human.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/yuval-noah-harari\">Yuval Noah Harari</a>\u2019s previous book, the global bestseller <em>Sapiens</em>, laid out the last 75,000 years of human history to remind us that there is nothing special or essential about who we are. We are an accident. Homo sapiens is just one possible way of being human, an evolutionary contingency like every other creature on the planet. That book ended with the thought that the story of homo sapiens could be coming to an end. We are at the height of our power but we may also have reached its limit. <em>Homo Deus</em> makes good on this thought to explain how our unparalleled ability to control the world around us is turning us into something new.</p> <p>The evidence of our power is everywhere: we have not simply conquered nature but have also begun to defeat humanity\u2019s own worst enemies. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/22/better-angels-steven-pinker-review\">War is increasingly obsolete</a>; famine is rare; disease is on the retreat around the world. We have achieved these triumphs by building ever more complex networks that treat human beings as units of information. Evolutionary science teaches us that, in one sense, we are nothing but data-processing machines: we too are algorithms. By manipulating the data we can exercise mastery over our fate. The trouble is that other algorithms \u2013 the ones that we have built \u2013 can do it far more efficiently than we can. That\u2019s what Harari means by the \u201cuncoupling\u201d of intelligence and consciousness. The project of modernity was built on the idea that individual human beings are the source of meaning as well as power. We are meant to be the ones who decide what happens to us: as voters, as consumers, as lovers. But that\u2019s not true any more. We are what gives networks their power: they use our ideas of meaning to determine what will happen to us.</p> <p>Not all of this is new. The modern state, which has been around for about 400 years, is really just another data-processing machine. The philosopher Thomas Hobbes, writing in 1651, called it an \u201cautomaton\u201d (or what we would call a robot). Its robotic quality is the source of its power and also its heartlessness: states don\u2019t have a conscience, which is what allows them sometimes to do the most fearful things. What\u2019s changed is that there are now processing machines that are far more efficient than states: as Harari points out, governments find it almost impossible to keep up with the pace of technological advance. It has also become much harder to sustain the belief \u2013 shared by Hobbes \u2013 that behind every state there are real flesh-and-blood human beings. The modern insistence on the autonomy of the individual goes along with a view that it should be possible to find the heart of this heartless world. Keep scratching at a faceless bureaucracy and you\u2019ll eventually uncover a civil servant with real feelings. But keep scratching at a search engine and all you\u2019ll find are data points.</p> <p>We are just at the start of this process of data-driven transformation and Harari says there is little we can do to stop it. <em>Homo Deus</em> is an \u201cend of history\u201d book, but not in the crude sense that he believes things have come to a stop. Rather the opposite: things are moving so fast that it\u2019s impossible to imagine what the future might hold. In 1800 it was possible to think meaningfully about what the world of 1900 would be like and how we might fit in. That\u2019s history: a sequence of events in which human beings play the leading part. But the world of 2100 is at present almost unimaginable. We have no idea where we\u2019ll fit in, if at all. We may have built a world that has no place for us.</p> <p>Given what an alarming thought this is, and since we aren\u2019t there yet, why can\u2019t we do more to stop it from happening? Harari thinks the modern belief that individuals are in charge of their fate was never much more than a leap of faith. Real power always resided with networks. Individual human beings are relatively powerless creatures, no match for lions or bears. It\u2019s what they can do as groups that has enabled them to take over the planet. These groupings \u2013 corporations, religions, states \u2013 are now part of a vast network of interconnected information flows. Finding points of resistance, where smaller units can stand up to the waves of information washing around the globe, is becoming harder all the time.</p> <p>Some people have given up the fight. In place of the founding tenets of modernity \u2013 liberalism, democracy and personal autonomy \u2013 there is a new religion: Dataism. Its followers \u2013 many of whom reside in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/silicon-valley\">Bay Area</a> of California \u2013 put their faith in information by encouraging us to see it as the only true source of value. We are what we contribute to data processing. There is potentially a huge upside to this: it means we will face fewer and fewer obstacles to getting what we want, because the information needed to supply us will be instantly accessible. Our likes and our experiences will merge. Our lifespans could also be hugely extended: Dataists believe that immortality is the next frontier to be crossed. But the downside is obvious, too. Who will \u201cwe\u201d be any more? Nothing more than an accumulation of information points. Twentieth-century political dystopias sought to stamp on individuals with the power of the state. That won\u2019t be necessary in the coming century. As Harari says: \u201cThe individual will not be crushed by Big Brother; it will disintegrate from within.\u201d</p> <p>Corporations and governments will continue to pay homage to our individuality and unique needs, but in order to service them they will need to \u201cbreak us up into biochemical subsystems\u201d, all of them permanently monitored by powerful algorithms. There is a dystopian political aspect to this, too: the early adopters \u2013 the individuals who sign up first to the Dataist project \u2013 will be the only ones with any real power left and it will be relatively unchallenged. Gaining entry into this new super-elite will be incredibly hard. You\u2019ll need heroic levels of education plus zero squeamishness about marrying your personal identity with intelligent machines. Then you can become one of the new \u201cgods\u201d. It\u2019s a grim prospect: a small priestly caste of seers with access to the ultimate source of knowledge, and the rest of humanity simply tools in their vast schemes. The future could be a digitally supercharged version of the distant past: ancient Egypt multiplied by the power of Facebook.</p> <p>Harari is careful not to predict that these outlandish visions will come to pass. The future is unknowable, after all. He reserves his strongest opinions for what all this should mean for the current state of relations between humans and animals. If intelligence and consciousness are coming apart then this puts most human beings in the same situation as other animals: capable of suffering at the hands of the possessors of superior intelligence. Harari does not seem too worried about the prospect of robots treating us like we treat flies, with violent indifference. Rather, he wants us to think about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/25/industrial-farming-one-worst-crimes-history-ethical-question\">how we are treating animals in our vast industrialised farming systems</a>. Pigs unquestionably suffer when living in cramped conditions or forcibly separated from their young. If we think this suffering doesn\u2019t count because it is not allied to a higher intelligence, then we are building a rod for our own backs. Soon the same will be true of us. And what price our suffering then?</p> <p>This is a very intelligent book, full of sharp insights and mordant wit. But as Harari would probably be the first to admit, it\u2019s only intelligent by human standards, which are nothing special. By the standards of the smartest machines it\u2019s woolly and speculative. The datasets are pretty limited. Its real power comes from the sense of a distinctive consciousness behind it. It is a quirky and cool book, with a sliver of ice at its heart. Harari cares about the fate of animals in a human world but he writes about the prospects for homo sapiens in a data-driven world with a lofty insouciance. I have to admit I found this deeply appealing, but that may be because of who I am (apart from anything else, a man). Not everyone will find it so. But it is hard to imagine anyone could read this book without getting an occasional, vertiginous thrill. Nietzsche once wrote that humanity is about to set sail on an open sea, now that we have finally left Christian morality behind. <em>Homo Deus</em> makes it feel as if we are standing at the edge of a cliff after a long and arduous journey. The journey doesn\u2019t seem so important any more. We are about to step into thin air.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow</em> is published by Harvill Secker.

  "<p>Penzance, the most westerly major town in Cornwall, is known for its picturesque port flanked by sandy beaches. But while many children are enjoying the summer holidays building sandcastles and eating (clotted cream) ice cream, the children from one of the town\u2019s estates can only dream of days at the seaside. Treneere is only a mile away but parents, unable to afford the ice cream and bus journey to get tired children home, avoid the outing. It may as well be 100 miles away.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/26/cornwall-fears-loss-of-funding-after-backing-brexit\">Cornwall fears loss of funding after backing Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.endchildpoverty.org.uk/poverty-in-your-area/\">child poverty rate in Penzance is 41% </a>\u2013 on a par with parts of inner city London, Birmingham and Manchester \u2013 compared to the national average of 25%, according to the Campaign to End Child Poverty.

Poverty on Treneere and in other parts of Cornwall, notably Redruth and Camborne, is long term and deeply ingrained.</p> <p>In the heart of the estate is the Lescudjack centre, named after a nearby unexcavated Iron Age settlement. It used to house council-run universal early years services for all local children under the Labour government\u2019s Sure Start programme. But during the coalition government, services were reduced to the most needy. In 2015, ownership of the centre was transferred to a<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.trelya.com/\"> local charity, Trelya</a>, which provides positive interventions into the lives of the children and young people who services find it hardest to help. Parenting courses and a toy library still run from the building but many of its offerings have been downgraded or cut. The charity runs a mother and baby group, and is soon to launch a free nursery on site. More than 200 people currently use the centre on a weekly basis. Many of the mothers have been involved with the charity since they themselves were children, such is the cycle of poverty.</p> <p>Sarah Wilson, a 33-year-old single mother of five, who works long hours as a care worker, is one of them.

She now attends Treyla\u2019s mother and baby group with her one-year-old son Liam and lives in a council-run mother and baby unit. She and her partner have been on the council\u2019s social housing waiting list since she was three months pregnant. Echoing Wilson\u2019s comments, she says: \u201cThere are no houses and they don\u2019t prioritise young people \u2026 and loads of houses here are owned by people who just stay in them just one month a year.\u201d Although her partner has a full-time job as a cleaner, they can\u2019t afford to rent privately on his income.

They dread going to school as they don\u2019t often have a clean uniform, and know they will get into trouble for not having a PE kit, or for being late because nobody was there to wake them up. They might be bullied for their unkempt appearance, not having the same trainers as everyone, for being poor.</p> <p>\u201cThey often have chaotic family lives with unstable relationships,\u201d Keene explains. \u201cThere are often mental health issues, violence either in or out of the home and substance abuse. As a result you have children who don\u2019t feel secure. There isn\u2019t just a lack of aspiration, [It\u2019s that] aspiration doesn\u2019t even apply to them.

Keene says: \u201cHaving been here for 14 years, we understand the complexities that the children and their families are facing. We\u2019re a generation in now. The girls are now having their own babies and we feel like having access to those babies is a real chance to fracture that cycle of deprivation.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a tall order, especially as changes to universal tax credits could plunge millions more people into poverty over the next four years, while making those already below the poverty line, poorer. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) predicts that relative <a href=\"http://cpag.org.uk/content/uk-set-biggest-increase-child-poverty-generation\">child poverty will increase by 50% in the UK \u2013 from 17% in 2014-15 to 25.7% by 2020-21</a>.</p> <p>In December a<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-hid-report-revealing-full-impact-of-cuts-to-sure-start-childrens-centres-a6808321.html\"> damning report</a> revealed the harm done by cuts to children\u2019s centres across England.

Several members of the two groups have since been incarcerated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8aadcdb79a8ab5716de179a4cf641251517ae8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8aadcdb79a8ab5716de179a4cf641251517ae8b/0_82_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"The children of Tran Thi Thanh Loan, pictured with their new school purchases made from funds provided by a crowd fund in Australia.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The children of Tran Thi Thanh Loan, pictured with their new school purchases made from funds provided by a crowd fund in Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tran Thi Thanh Loan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to Loan, the family originally left because the state had seized their land, they had lost their livelihood due to Chinese incursions into fishing grounds, and also because of institutionalised discrimination against Catholics. While Australian authorities claim they were fairly assessed, she said that a translator was not provided for the group, none of whom spoke English. They only realised they were being returned when they reached port in Vietnam.</p> <p>Via Facebook and the help of a friend of the family\u2019s lawyer, I was able to get in touch with Vo and Loan. Initially, Loan was too embarrassed to accept any help, but finally convinced by her lawyer, she calculated that her children\u2019s living and education expenses amount to 7,000,000 Vietnamese dong per month, which is roughly equivalent to AUD$425, or about $5,000 for the year. But there was another complication \u2013 she did not have a bank account and would need to open one before I could send the first monthly payment.</p> <p>There have been several reports in the media about these failed asylum seekers being sent to prison despite assurances to Australian officials they would not be punished. So far, the Australian government seems not to have done anything about this injustice. Indeed, Australian authorities have c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/22/vietnamese-asylum-seekers-turned-back-after-being-processed-at-sea\">ontinued to return Vietnamese intercepted in the Timor Sea</a>. That\u2019s why I decided I had to step in. </p> <p>I had never believed before that one person could really make a difference. But social media has changed that. Earlier this month, I launched an <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/nevertearusapart\">online fundraising campaign for Loan\u2019s children</a>, with the target amount of $10,000 in order to ensure not only that they are well provided for but also that their parents are able to get back on their feet once they are released from jail. We are well on the way to achieving our goal. We are a disparate group from various cultural backgrounds and walks of life doing the work that our government won\u2019t. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/22/vietnamese-asylum-seekers-turned-back-after-being-processed-at-sea\">Vietnamese asylum seekers turned back after being processed at sea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Loan has told me that she and her children are currently living with her parents after her house was destroyed and land confiscated by the Vietnamese government.

Who can blame the drought-stricken harvesters of reluctant votes for wanting to irrigate their parched soil with arguments drawn from the reservoir of Olympian goodwill?</p> <p>It never works, because an essential quality of sporting spectacle is respite from the things that politics demands we think about.

A new cycle of turbulence will disturb the peace, but for now the prime minister elicits that most undervalued of public reactions to a leader: comfortable indifference.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For the minority who do follow the minutiae it is easy to confuse casualness of attention with ignorance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Anyone who has tried to extract political opinions from strangers \u2013 a niche pursuit of canvassing activists and&#xa0;vox-popping journalists \u2013 knows that the obligation to take a definite view is often felt as a burden. This is not always an expression of alienation or contempt for politicians, although those are growing trends. I have observed focus groups of swing voters, selected for their record of conscientious participation in elections, and been struck by a combination of haziness on detail and acuity in extracting the essence of a situation. They often discern the outline of the wood better than those of us who spend our lives scrutinising bark on the trees.</p> <p>People who could not name a single member of David Cameron\u2019s cabinet knew instinctively that he had blundered complacently into a European referendum and would be undone by it. Former Labour supporters who dismiss Jeremy Corbyn laugh at the prospect of his becoming prime minister not because they love austerity but because he radiates pious amateurishness. These voters would, I suspect, be indifferent to the empty gesture of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/jeremy-corbyn-floor-three-hour-train-journey-london-newcastle\" title=\"\">Labour leader sitting on a train floor</a> in ostentatious solidarity with miserable commuters, yet seize on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/23/jeremy-corbyn-virgin-trains-disputes-claim-over-lack-of-seats\" title=\"\">suspicion that he ignored vacant seats</a> to stage the scene.</p> <p>There is a wide spectrum of engagement between apathy and obsession. It is valid to care about Labour\u2019s future and still rather spend a summer evening grappling with the arcane points system of omnium cycling than attend a leadership hustings.</p> <p>For the minority who do follow the minutiae it is easy to confuse casualness of attention with ignorance. There is the seductive distinction between those who get it and those who don\u2019t: dumb herd and wise shepherds. That fallacy is not unique to the left, but more common there. Partly it is the residue of a Marxist conviction that politics follows quasi-scientific laws governing the distribution of economic power. If wealth is not justly apportioned across society, a majority will eventually demand redistribution. If they fail to rally to the left\u2019s manifesto, it must be because sabotage interferes with the signal. Treasonous MPs suffocate the argument; corporate interests use rotten media to fill the empty vessel of public consciousness with false belief.</p> <p>It is true that British press coverage is skewed against liberal arguments on immigration and social-democratic prescriptions for economic restructuring. It is also true that no workable strategy for overcoming that bias involves retreat into self-righteous resentment of anyone who questions the viability of a radical left project.</p> <p>There is a tendency in Labour, predating Corbyn\u2019s leadership but massively amplified by it, to map politics on an axis from stupidity to enlightenment with parallel lines on the graph showing a journey from right to left and indifference to enthusiasm. It follows that an increase in the exuberance of support for a retro-socialist candidate indicates real progress.</p> <p>But when you consider that most people see political fandom as a mark of eccentricity, a noisier fan club is likelier to indicate higher barriers separating the party from the rest of the country. To pack a venue with hundreds of people chanting in unison, declaring their allegiance on T-shirts, is an achievement matched by non-league football clubs that never win trophies and indie bands that never top the charts. It is politics as a serious hobby, leaving serious politics to the professionals.</p> <p>The Tories understand this. While conservatism has ideological components, it succeeds when those strains are couched in tones of managerial moderation \u2013 the promise to mind the shop, freeing up voters to pursue their lives unencumbered by a duty to be overtly political. A historic failure of Labour has been the inability to challenge an unspoken cultural presumption \u2013 internalised even by many of the party\u2019s supporters \u2013 that Tory rule is Britain\u2019s default setting, interrupted only by episodes of leftward correction. Tony Blair unsettled that view, then his party disowned the achievement. May is now the happy beneficiary of a return to the traditional roles: Tories govern; Labour complains. Labour offers politics as a febrile state of mind; the Tories handle politics for people who would rather be doing something else.</p>",
  "<p>The Animal Condition kicks off in full-blown leftist activist mode: a group of four then 20-something friends \u2013 Michael Dahlstrom, Ande Cunningham, Sarah-Jane McAllan and Augusta Miller \u2013 stumble across videos online of abattoirs and are incensed by what they see. </p> <p>The four Nida graduates thus resolve to make an undercover documentary exposing the wicked ways of the Australian meat trade. They secure a small amount of funding from an animal welfare organisation and hook up with hardcore activists who, in a cloak-and-dagger-like way, sneak them on to paddocks and into battery hen factories under the cover of darkness.</p> <p>The biggest surprise wasn\u2019t what they found on farms in the dead of night but the response they got when they approached authorities in broad daylight. According to Dahlstrom, the now 36-year-old director, the industry had a reputation for not talking to film-makers; that applied especially, one assumes, to inexperienced hotheads who were literally jumping the fence. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1d58388d54575ee20ac7c371ffc7cb3f3226dfe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1d58388d54575ee20ac7c371ffc7cb3f3226dfe/0_0_1095_611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah McAllen, Ande Cunningham and Augusta Miller join animal activists on a late-night farm raid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"558\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah McAllen, Ande Cunningham and Augusta Miller join animal activists on a late-night farm raid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Animal Condition</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So they tried a different tack: \u201cAfter realising we were only getting one side of the story we went in with honesty and said we\u2019d been hanging out with activists,\u201d he says. \u201cThe first ones we spoke to were Australian Pork Ltd. They took us by surprise and allowed us to go into their farms. A lot of times just with the farmer, not any PR people or media spokespeople. They often gave us unfettered access.\u201d</p> <p>Impressed by this transparency \u2013 surely a reminder of Lyndon B Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"http://quotes.yourdictionary.com/pissing\">old saying about tents and pissing</a> \u2013 the group resolved to keep an open mind.</p> <p>Like each of the four, Miller, 30, served as a writer, producer and on-screen investigator: \u201cSome of us were meat eaters, some of us were vegetarians,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had a wide perspective of ideas about food and the right way \u2013 or the wrong way \u2013 to consume food. But we were open to those ideas changing.\u201d</p> <p>The result is a deeply engrossing documentary with a refreshingly honest and self-reflexive approach, engendering a real sense that the audience\u2019s journey is one shared by the film-makers. Shot over the course of just under four years, Dahlstrom and his team watched as treatment of cattle became a hot topic, thanks in part to stories broadcast on <a>Four Corners </a>and <a href=\"http://www.animalsaustralia.org/features/60-minutes-the-hidden-truth.php\">60 Minutes</a>.<br></p> <p>\u201cBy the end of the film we were hearing things from all sides. From activists, scientists, ethicists, farmers, industry and government,\u201d he says. \u201cAs we started to find ourselves at the heart of a key issue for Australia \u2013 live export and animal welfare \u2013 we found that people suddenly wanted to talk to us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abeaef1df0d2760d04f11546621a0f3646d503aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abeaef1df0d2760d04f11546621a0f3646d503aa/0_0_1500_839/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ande Cunningham plays piano with three chicks rescued in a farm raid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"559\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ande Cunningham plays piano with three chicks rescued in a farm raid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Animal Condition</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Key on-screen talent is varied, including the leader of Katter\u2019s Australian party, Bob Katter, the Greens senator Lee Rhiannon, the then agriculture minister, Joe Ludwig, a number of industry representatives and animal welfare advocates Peter Singer and Lyn White. </p> <p>What the team also found, according to Miller, was that a great deal more was being asked of farmers in an area few had expertise in: media management.</p> <p>\u201cFor a lot of these men and women, who have long histories in agriculture, they haven\u2019t necessarily had to discuss their farming practices with the public,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve had to learn very quickly how to talk about what they do in a quote/unquote \u2018palatable\u2019 manner.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s something that, for many people in the industry, goes back generations, so you\u2019re dealing with something that is very personal to them. I could see the struggle they were having with suddenly having to metaphorically and literally open the doors.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps it is ironic that a film sensitive to issues facing farmers begins with the creators sneaking on to their land. The issue of secretly recorded footage is a topical one, with the government introducing bans in recent years on filming in detention centres (as the recent documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/29/chasing-asylum-first-look-review-asylum-seeker-documentary-is-vital-and-gut-wrenching\">Chasing Asylum</a> reminded us) and Barnaby Joyce coming down hard against <a href=\"http://www.theland.com.au/story/3380094/joyce-still-backs-anti-trespass-laws\">animal rights activists recording covert footage</a>. </p> <p>\u201cWere it not for Animals Australia and their undercover footage in places like Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Malaysia, Jordan and Pakistan, we wouldn\u2019t know what is going on with Australian animals being sent overseas,\u201d Miller says. </p> <p>\u201cIt produces a lot of anger, both from industry and from the public. But until there\u2019s transparency within animal husbandry and agribusiness, I think undercover footage is a necessary part of this conversation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a77b794858b34548cb356af6fec5af3978f145a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a77b794858b34548cb356af6fec5af3978f145a9/0_0_1500_846/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ande Cunningham watches animal activist videos on YouTube, in a still from The Animal Condition\" width=\"1000\" height=\"564\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ande Cunningham watches animal activist videos on YouTube, in a still from The Animal Condition</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Animal Condition</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps it also a reminder that undercover footage is not necessarily a synonym for \u201clopsided\u201d or \u201cunfair\u201d. One of the subjects that drew the most sympathy from Dahlstrom is the same kind of person you might assume, if you only watched the film\u2019s jumping-the-fence opening act, that the team would want taken out of business.</p> <p>When the director met Malcolm Gett, one of the pioneers of animal intensification in Australia in the 1970s, the farmer had spent hundreds of thousand of dollars installing new sow stalls. These are small cages where breeding sows can only take one step forward and one step back, and can\u2019t turn around. </p> <p>While The Animal Condition was being shot, Dahlstrom says, \u201cthe governing body, Australian Pork Limited, came to an agreement where they were going to phase out sow stalls. This farmer ended up going bankrupt as a result. He was struggling at the beginning of the shoot but thought he\u2019d pull through. By the time we were in post, he\u2019d lost his farm.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve really got to look big picture with these things. If you go out and want to see change, it\u2019s not just about wanting to see the change happen overnight. </p> <p>\u201cIf you were someone who wanted to see an end to, say, battery hen farming, you need to see through that transition. In order for it to be effective, you have to have a plan so the hit on people\u2019s livelihood doesn\u2019t crush them.\u201d </p> <p><em>\u2022 The Animal Condition has <a href=\"http://www.theanimalcondition.com/screenings\">screenings around Australia</a> from 22 August</em></p>",

Trump rolls out new immigration look, praises Obama</h2> <p>Speaking on Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s program on Fox News, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/22/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-us-election-news-campaign-live?page=with:block-57bb9896e4b047b85f602a9b#block-57bb9896e4b047b85f602a9b\">rolled out a new version of</a> his now-obscure position on immigration, telling the host that \u201cI just want to follow the law\u201d...</p> <p>\u201cI just want to follow the law,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/22/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-us-election-news-campaign-live?page=with:block-57bb9896e4b047b85f602a9b#block-57bb9896e4b047b85f602a9b\">said</a>. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is following the law ... Now the existing laws are very strong. The existing laws, the first thing we are going to do if and when I win, is we are going to get rid of all of the bad ones. ... As far as everybody else, we are going to go through the process. What people don\u2019t know is Obama got tremendous numbers of people out of the country.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rickklein/status/768035137883873280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump actually said this: &quot;What people don&#39;t know is that Obama got tremendous numbers of people out of the country.&quot;</p>&mdash; Rick Klein (@rickklein) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickklein/status/768035137883873280\">August 23, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>2. Trump: \u2018war zones\u2019 safer than inner cities</h2> <p>Donald Trump veered off the teleprompter on Monday night to claim that \u201cinner cities run by the Democrats\u201d were more dangerous than countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan.[...]</p> <p>\u201cYou can go to war zones in countries that we are fighting and it is safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the Democrats,\u201d Trump said. The Republican nominee also promised if elected, \u201cwe\u2019ll get rid of the crime. You\u2019ll be able to walk down the street without getting shot. Now, you walk down the street, you get shot.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/donald-trump-inner-city-crime-war-zone-hillary-clinton\">Trump: inner cities run by Democrats are more dangerous than war zones</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>3. Trump jacked rent at Trump Tower once donor money flowed</h2> <p>The Trump campaign rents office space in Trump Tower. When Donald Trump was mostly self-financing his campaign, the office space cost one thing. When Trump began accepting more donations from the public, the price quintupled, the Huffington Post <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-campaign-rent_us_57bba424e4b03d51368a82b9\">reports</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trump nearly quintupled the monthly rent his presidential campaign pays for its headquarters at Trump Tower to $169,758 in July, when he was raising funds from donors, compared with March, when he was self-funding his campaign, according to a Huffington Post review of Federal Election Commission filings. The rent jumped even though he was paying fewer staff in July than he did in March. </p> <p>The Trump campaign paid Trump Tower Commercial LLC $35,458 in March \u2015 the same amount it had been paying since last summer \u2015 and had 197 paid employees and consultants. In July, it paid 172 employees and consultants. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MaxBoot/status/768049003841871872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Like Trump U, Trump campaign is a scam.
