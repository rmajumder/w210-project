They are \u2013 but things can be important without being interesting. Elections are important <em>and </em>interesting. They\u2019re interesting because they involve people \u2013 candidates, activists, voters, non-voters \u2013 and like most things involving people, explaining what they do and why they do it is not always straightforward. Sometimes it is depressing, sometimes it is uplifting, but it is always revealing.</p> <p>The ideal voter of democratic theory is a rational man or woman, someone who gathers all the evidence about the issues of the day and the plans of the parties, weighs it all up responsibly, cogitating at length, and then delivers a mature and informed judgment at the ballot box. Actual voters aren\u2019t much like that \u2013 which is why they are so interesting.</p> <p>In practice, voters\u2019 choices reflect the whole rich tapestry of human nature: swayed by emotions as well as reason, salesmen as well as products, by tribal attachment as well as cool calculation. Britain offers a particularly interesting case study for election researchers. We have more and more elections to study \u2013 with an electoral cycle that now coughs up an important set of contests on a yearly basis \u2013 which use an increasingly eclectic set of electoral procedures.</p> <p>There\u2019s the growing use of referendums \u2013 with two UK-wide contests in the last decade alone, plus separate ones in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. No one thinks those we have recently seen will be the last either. Then there are the voters, who are becoming ever more unpredictable, and continue to surprise even seasoned election watchers \u2013 both this June\u2019s referendum vote for Brexit and last May\u2019s Conservative Westminster majority confounded many.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The judgments rendered by the electorate are sometimes misinformed, and often harsh, but rarely irrational</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet those who think the decisions voters make are ignorant or even irrational do them a disservice. The judgments rendered by the electorate are sometimes misinformed, and often harsh, but they are rarely irrational.</p> <p>Take the vexed political issue of immigration. Many experts on the issue despair at the ignorance voters display: they seem hopelessly wrong about the numbers coming, the reasons they come and the impact they have on the economy. Yet although they are muddled on the details, voters are remarkably responsive on the big picture. Concern about the issue tracks numbers closely: when migrant numbers go up, more voters cite it as a concern. Voters noticed the pledges by successive governments to bring numbers down, they noticed when these pledges failed, and they noticed that one important reason for that failure was rising immigration from the EU. The growing number of voters who wanted immigration reduced drew the logical conclusions from all of this: the old parties had failed on the issue, so they turned to a new one (Ukip); controlling migration looked close to impossible within the EU, so they voted to leave.</p> <p>This pattern of behaviour \u2013 ignorant about the details, but responsive on the big picture \u2013 is one we see quite often. It has a lot to recommend it. When a room gets too cold, we respond by turning up the heating. When the room gets too hot, we turn it off. We usually manage to do this without knowing the precise temperature. Voters often display a similar thermostatic logic. Of course, voters aren\u2019t consistently rational even on the big picture stuff. But usually when they apparently go off the rails, there is an interesting logic underlying what they do, throwing light on the strengths and weaknesses of how we reason more generally.</p> <p>The approaching party conference season will provide plenty of examples of how politics is an expression of, and a reflection of, who we are and how we think. The parties will appeal to tribal loyalties and tribal enemies because all of us are swayed by tribal affinities, though we don\u2019t like to admit it. Politicians will appeal to our hearts over our heads because our decisions are often swayed more by our emotions than we like to believe. Politicians will promise contradictory things, because voters often demand contradictory things. And even those who never watch a minute of this will be forming judgments based on conversations at work, with friends or around the family dinner table \u2013 as well as longer-standing allegiances, identities and beliefs.</p> <p>This is why we love to study politics for a living \u2013 it reflects human nature in all its contradictory and capricious variety. The ballot box is not just the cornerstone of our democracy \u2013 it is a window into ourselves.</p> <p><em>Philip Cowley and Robert Ford\u2019s More Sex, Lies and the Ballot Box is published by Biteback on 1 September</em></p> <h2>WHAT VOTING PATTERNS TELL US ABOUT UK</h2> <h2>Love and politics: is it a good match?<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dfee62188a86d87101539084668fb4997013ea1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dfee62188a86d87101539084668fb4997013ea1/90_75_5347_3669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cNever kissed a Tory\u201d T shirts in the London Pride Parade\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cNever kissed a Tory\u201d T shirts in the London Pride Parade.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>When meeting a new partner\u2019s parents, it may be best to steer the conversation away from politics - especially if they are Labour voters and you aren\u2019t. Just one in eight Conservative voters say they would be unhappy for their children to marry a Labour supporter, but more than a quarter of Labour voters would oppose a romantic match between their child and a Conservative or Ukip voter. We see politics, like everything, through the prism of social groups and social stereotypes - and usually it is those on the left who are the more reluctant to judge people based on their group membership. But when it comes to political tribes, the left are most judgmental. One plausible explanation is that the stereotypes Labour supporters hold about Conservatives are more powerful, and more negative, than those running in the other direction - so the risk of a frosty reception is higher for the young Conservative setting foot in a Labour household. </strong></p> <h2><strong>Does religion affect the way we vote?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Alastair Campbell once famously interrupted an interview with Tony Blair by saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t do God.\u201d Campbell\u2019s objection reflected a general belief that the English don\u2019t like their politics mixed up with their religion. But it\u2019s not true. Surveys stretching back to the 1980s show a remarkably consistent pattern: Catholic voters in England lean towards Labour, while Church of England voters lean towards the Conservatives. This isn\u2019t due to differences in the economic or social status of the different denominations, or to messages from the pulpit. It\u2019s a relic of an earlier era, when religion mattered for politics - and when the Church of England was called \u201cthe Tory party at prayer\u201d. Voters pass their political allegiances down from generation to generation, and so voters with a religious affiliation often retain the political affinities that once went with it, long after religion itself ceased to be a political matter.</strong></p> <h2>Why party ties no longer bind</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec245100524eb2ca7f0e7fa1ee18b4fdc3761bcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec245100524eb2ca7f0e7fa1ee18b4fdc3761bcc/0_0_3176_3304/961.jpg\" alt=\"Young Conservatives\u2019 conference in Eastbourne, 1975.\" width=\"961\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young Conservatives\u2019 conference in Eastbourne, 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tribal political affiliations can powerfully influence how we see each other but, in Britain at least, they are in decline. We live in the golden age of the political swinger: more voters than ever before switch parties from one election to the next. A big driver of this is a steady rise in the share of the electorate who feel no great attachment to any of the parties. Such voters were once a rarity. Many voters growing up in the 1960s and 1970s ended up with a lasting political loyalty, usually to Labour or the Conservatives. Young voters today are less willing to enter into long-term political relationships - well over half of those born in the 1980s have made it into their 30s without developing a party loyalty. The result is more demanding voters, who cannot be bought off with appeals to traditional loyalty, and more volatile politics, as the disappointed have few qualms about switching sides - including to new political entrants. With demands rising, loyalty declining and new competitors emerging on multiple fronts, life has never been harder for the mainstream parties\u2019 politicians.</strong></p> <h2><strong>When losers still win</strong></h2> <p><strong>If mainstream politics is in crisis, nobody seems to have told the party members. Even as party loyalties in the broader electorate have ebbed away, formal party membership has enjoyed a remarkable renaissance, with huge surges recorded by the SNP and Labour, and big bumps for the Liberal Democrats, Greens and Ukip. Two qualities set this rebirth of political engagement apart. First, the speed and scale of the member surges is unprecedented: hundreds and in some cases thousands of new members were signing up every day recently. Second, the biggest surges have come after high-profile political defeats - the SNP\u2019s greatest surge came in the wake of the 2014 independence referendum, which it lost; Labour and the Lib Dems both signed up flocks of supporters in summer 2015, after a heavy election defeat. In the past we have assumed that success breeds success - this was true for Labour\u2019s membership renaissance under Blair in the late 1990s - but now, it seems, the loser takes it all.</strong></p> <h2>Are the young keen \u2013 or apathetic? </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51c8cdaf895725cfa154cf19379caf8a0384b4cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51c8cdaf895725cfa154cf19379caf8a0384b4cd/0_0_4385_2919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon and a young woman voter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Sturgeon and a young woman voter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Much ink has been spilled on the subject of declining youth turnout, and for good reason: the \u201cmillennial\u201d generation - those who came of age at the turn of the millennium - is by some margin the least electorally engaged we have ever seen. Many have argued that the young are, in fact, very politically engaged but are turned off by stuffy, traditional forms of politics (like voting) and much keener on new forms of engagement \u2013 social movements, social networks, direct action. Yet if we take a close look at the attitudes of the young, we find that young voters aren\u2019t fired up by the issues but turned off by politics as usual. The young have more confidence in the traditional political system than their elders, but are also much more likely to find politics boring. Today\u2019s young are not particularly angry or alienated - but they are the most politically apathetic generation in the history of British survey research.</strong></p> <h2>Weather matters \u2026</h2> <p><strong>We know the British love to discuss the weather. But does it affect their political behaviour? This is an easier question to pose than to answer - the British weather is famously variable and changeable, rain clouds come and go, sunshine rarely lasts. But one element of the climate does vary in a systematic and predictable way - the seasons. And it turns out political behaviour, like much else in nature, follows a seasonal cycle. When we look at turnout in local council byelections, which run almost every Thursday through the year, we find that turnout peaks in early summer, before falling away gradually as the nights draw in, to a low ebb in December, when the days are shortest. Some voters, it seems, are like bears - retreating from the ballot box as the cold of winter approaches, before returning with the flowers of spring.</strong></p> <p><strong><br></strong></p> <h2>\u2026 and so does geography</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10e4d1a0b32d602d133005f9c75bd8e6dbb43ef0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10e4d1a0b32d602d133005f9c75bd8e6dbb43ef0/0_0_4287_2847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The ornate entrance door to the town hall in Lewes, East Sussex.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ornate entrance door to the town hall in Lewes, East Sussex.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The seasonal behaviour of voters is not the only unusual thing about local government elections. As we have noted, traditional loyalties to Labour and the Conservatives have steadily eroded, and more voters than ever are turning to new entrants as political competition fragments. Yet look at one of England\u2019s town halls and you will be in for a surprise. In local government, Labour and the Conservatives are more dominant than ever before - they provide more than 80% of the nation\u2019s councillors and control more than 80% of the nation\u2019s councils: among the highest figures recorded since local government was reorganised in the 1970s. The reason is geography, and more specifically how it drives the translation from votes to seats. The Liberal Democrats, once a powerful force in local government, have collapsed since 2010. They were masters of building up concentrated local support and turning it into council seat wins. The new entrants in English politics - Ukip and the Greens - are much less good at this. They field more candidates and win more votes than ever before, but hardly ever enough to win seats. Until these new parties learn the art of turning votes into seats, their presence in local elections just ends up splitting the opposition vote and helping the local political establishment.</strong></p> <h2>The catch with devolution </h2> <p><strong>Leaders of local and sub-national government (to adopt the formal term) perennially complain that they need more powers if they are to do their jobs properly. Voters often agree: surveys in many countries show strong support for devolving powers to local and sub-national governments, including Scotland and Wales, whose devolved governments have accumulated steadily more powers since their introduction. There\u2019s just one catch: voters want more powerful regional governments, but they don\u2019t want these governments to do anything that results in policy varying between sub-nations in the same state. Voters really dislike the idea of university fees, or access to medicines, or criminal sentences varying \u2013 even though such variation is an obvious consequence of devolution. Partly this reflects confusion about who is responsible for what: voters often blame the central government if they do poorly relative to others, even if the devolved government is responsible (something devolved governments themselves have little incentive to discourage). But there\u2019s also some good sense underlying the confusion: voters\u2019 views about policy variation are often driven by whether they think their area will win or lose from the process. Residents of richer places support variation in outcomes because they think they will gain from it; voters in poorer ones are more sceptical because they stand to lose. So voters want devolution, provided they are always the ones who win from the process - an unreasonable, but not illogical, demand. </strong></p>",

Without extra funding for the expected influx, social, economic, political and security stability of the region will be \u201cat risk of total collapse\u201d, the documents warn.

Iraqi troops took the key town of Qaraya, near a major airbase, 70km south of Mosul, while Kurdish forces are even closer.</p> <p>The city has huge strategic and propaganda value for both sides as capital of Isis operations in Iraq, and is the group\u2019s last stronghold in the country after it was pushed out of Ramadi and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/26/falluja-iraq-fully-liberated-from-isis\">Falluja</a>.</p> <p>The battles to evict it from those cities were seen as precursor and preparation for retaking Mosul, with tough street fighting and Isis tactics including ruthless use of civilians as human shields and leaving streets and buildings laced with booby traps.</p> <p>Far greater numbers of ordinary Iraqis are at risk in Mosul, however, with around 1.2 million civilians still in the city and another 800,000 in the countryside surrounding it, the Kurdish government estimates. Ramadi by contrast was virtually deserted by the time Iraqi forces and anti-Isis militias closed in, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/31/falluja-isis-militants-believed-to-have-stopped-20000-civilians-leaving-city\">Fallujah was estimated to have as few as 40,000 civilians left</a>.</p> <p>The Kurdish government planning documents describe three ways it believes the battle could play out. Even the most optimistic scenario, a rapid, successful campaign with most Mosul civilians simply bunkered down at home, is expected to trigger a minimum of 100,000 new refugees.</p> <p>The bleakest forecast is for a battle that drags on for months with heavy street fighting, and sends more than a million people fleeing into Kurdistan.</p> <p>The government deems the \u201cmost likely\u201d outcome something between the two, with an offensive that drags out from weeks to months, a virtual siege on the city as major roads in and out are cut \u2013 draining supplies of food, water and medicine \u2013 and intensive fighting and airstrikes in the city.</p> <p>That would create over 400,000 new refugees, the forecast warns, most arriving gradually as the fighting spread and intensified. Feeding and sheltering them would cost more than $275m for the first six months alone, and they are likely to arrive with little beyond the clothes on their backs.</p> <p>\u201cIt is highly likely that hundreds of thousands of people will be displaced, trapped, stranded, injured and killed.

Two years ago, Baghdad slashed funding in a bid to punish it for arranging independent oil export contracts.</p> <p>By spring the crisis was so bad that even peshmerga fighters had gone without pay for several months, until the US government finally agreed to step in and pay salaries for troops who have proved a key group on the frontline against Isis.</p> <p>The cash only covered the military however, so civil servants have gone for months without wages, apparently willing to struggle on while the threat of Isis looms, and Iraqi Kurdistan preserves a degree of security in a violent region.</p> <p>To preserve its record \u201cas a safe haven\u201d, largely spared the Isis attacks that have killed hundreds of civilians in Syria, Turkey and other parts of Iraq, the government has closed its borders and plans checkpoints to vet new arrivals for any would-be militant infiltrators.</p> <p>\u201cMeasures are in place and will be reinforced along the front line and the entry points to [the region] in the event of large population movement,\u201d the outline plan suggests.</p> <p>Analysts warn that the scale of refugee arrivals may overwhelm any screening plans, but even if Kurdish authorities can keep out militants, the influx of new arrivals risks further inflaming ethnic and territorial tensions in the region.</p> <p>Kurdish advances against Isis in both Syria and Iraq have raised suspicions about their territorial ambitions among both governments and local Arab populations. They fear maps are being redrawn in ways that could deprive them of their homes, as Kurdish forces seize territory they have long wanted as part of their autonomous region, often with a majority Turkish population.</p> <p>\u201cAll the areas that have been liberated by the peshmerga forces, our (Kurdish) forces will stay there,\u201d Falah Mustafa, the head of the Iraqi Kurdish region\u2019s foreign relations department told the Associated Press, echoing statements by numerous officials.</p> <p>The land taken with the help of US airstrikes, since Isis moved on Mosul in 2014, is already equivalent to around half of the official Kurdish autonomous region. Perhaps the biggest prize has been the city of Kirkuk, seized by Kurdish forces that summer, who said they were protecting it from Isis after the Iraqi military all but collapsed.</p> <p>Since then, as Isis\u2019s holdings have been rolled back, there have been increasingly vocal protests from refugees barred from returning home on security grounds. Many are Arab and Yazidi, and fear that peshmerga are using security as a pretext to consolidate land gains.</p> <p>In Syria, Kurdish advances have also added to Arab fears, and prompted Turkey to join the fight against Isis in a bid to diminish Kurdish gains and influence.</p> <p>In both countries Kurdish forces\u2019 effectiveness in fighting Isis has drawn western funds and military support that are bolstering wider hopes \u2013 in Syria for autonomy and in Iraq for independence. The advances are parallel however, signalling more a rise in overall Kurdish power and confidence, rather than any step towards a united Kurdistan.</p> <p>There is little love lost between the Iraqi Kurdish ruling party and the group that leads Kurdish forces across the border inside Syria.

  "<p>As Guinness Pro12 organisers look at ways of boosting income to help sides grapple with the greater financial muscle of clubs in France and England, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/17/gregor-townsend-scotland-coach-vern-cotter-glasgow\" title=\"\">Scotland\u2019s coach-in-waiting, Gregor Townsend</a>, insists there is no reason to panic.</p> <p>The television deals for the Pro12 work out at around \u00a31m per side, compared with \u00a33.5m in England and more than \u00a35m in France, but Townsend, who takes charge of Glasgow for a fifth and final season before succeeding Vern Cotter, says the cross-border league has always been financially disadvantaged.</p> <p>\u201cFrance and England have had more money thanks to the deals their greater populations generate,\u201d said Townsend, whose playing career in four countries included stints in the Premiership and Top 14. \u201cWe have to get on with it in the Pro12 and what we have is a tournament high on quality, helped by the fact there is no relegation.</p> <p>\u201cThere is more interest than ever before and its profile has never been higher. The arrow is definitely pointing upwards and we have to work hard to make sure we keep improving. It is a unique tournament involving 12 teams from four countries and more current internationals play in it than the Premiership or Top 14.</p> <p>\u201cIf the other two leagues have more money, players in the Pro12 are highly motivated to play international rugby: playing for Glasgow and Edinburgh, for example, helps them achieve that goal. You can only be positive when you recall what the old Celtic League was like. The Scottish sides struggled to get crowds but now there is growth and the final is played in a national stadium.\u201d</p> <p>Glasgow start their campaign at Connacht next Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/30/glasgow-munster-pro-12-final-match-report\" title=\"\">the 2015 champions</a> travelling to the team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/behind-the-lines/2016/may/24/connacht-pro-12-final-rugby-union-leinster\" title=\"\">who took their crown in May</a>. Townsend, who won 82 caps for Scotland, is determined to sign off on a high, saying that until a few months ago he had no immediate ambition to coach the national side. \u201cI spent a few years as an assistant Scotland coach [2009-12] and while it was wonderful to be involved with the team, I have enjoyed coaching Glasgow and having the opportunity to be head coach\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt was only a couple of months ago that I started thinking how great it would be to be involved with Scotland, even if I thought that day would be well into the future. I am delighted and honoured that the opportunity has come sooner but there is much for me to do before then. Coaching in the Pro12 is so intense you do not have time to think about anything else. We have to improve at Glasgow because we did not get to a final last season.</p> <p>\u201cI am very optimistic about the future of Scottish rugby at Pro12, European and international level. It starts with the players and we have some very good ones in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and they are young. It is the best player pool I have known and while it is as hard to hold on to players as it was five, 10 or 15 years ago, the lure of Test rugby is important and Scotland players know if they are based in the country, they are managed better. Part of our reason for being at Glasgow is to make sure the national side is as strong as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Townsend has been tipped as a candidate for the attack coach position on next summer\u2019s Lions tour to New Zealand which comes 20 years after, as fly-half, he helped achieve a series victory in South Africa. \u201cThat is a hypothetical question,\u201d he said, when asked if he would be interested. \u201cIt will be some tour to face the best team in the world who are playing fantastic rugby.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a great time to be involved in our sport, a positive era after the political fallouts of the past. Stadia are full and more people are coming into a game which is better to watch with outstanding skill levels. The Pro12 is really punching its weight.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The first England squad of Sam Allardyce\u2019s reign is named on Sunday and whatever you think of Andre Gray \u2013 whether you have decided he has all the personal charm of head lice, or you would rather take a more sympathetic view \u2013 we can probably assume that if he was ever being considered as an outside choice, or a possible back-up player, a cross has temporarily gone through his name.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t ludicrous, though, to think that Gray will eventually become part of the Allardyce era if he can maintain the forward momentum of his career.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/27/andre-gray-fa-charge-i-hate-lightys\">Andre Gray\u2019s FA charge sheet grows with 2014 \u2018I hate lightys\u2019 tweet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gray was the most prolific scorer in last season\u2019s Championship, scoring 23 times to help bring top-division football back to Burnley. Another nine came in pre-season and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/burnley-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">the goal against Liverpool last weekend</a> indicates he is not going to have too much difficulty adjusting to the higher league.</p> <p>Perhaps there might even be a day when he and Jamie Vardy are part of the same national team and can reminisce about that time, in April 2012, when they faced each other for Luton Town against Fleetwood Town in the Conference Premier.</p> <p>By now, however, you are probably aware of Gray\u2019s internet history and the kind of story that makes you long for more innocent days when tweeting was for sparrows, trolls lived in caves in fairytales and football clubs didn\u2019t have to worry about the damage that could be caused by players having smartphones that, evidently, were a lot smarter than their owners. Or, as Mick McCarthy once put it, \u201ctwits who tweet\u201d.</p> <p>There is no point going through all the content but the most glaring example contains a level of hashtag hate \u2014 \u201cIs it me or are there gays everywhere? #Burn #Die #MakesMeSick\u201d \u2014 that clearly goes beyond the usual hurling of online abuse and, unfortunately for Gray, a lot of people might think it doesn\u2019t wash to offer a template apology, professing to be a changed man, and trotting out the standard lines that defence lawyers use in court when they are trying to get their clients a reduced sentence.</p> <p>Even ignoring for one moment the pitchfork homophobia, Gray comes across as a difficult man to embrace. \u201cFumin,\u201d he writes. \u201cStuck in traffic cause some sad weak fool decided to get themselves run over on the motorway. #NoSympathy.\u201d There are memories of school (\u201cMa teacher told me a was a piece of shit.. saw her the other day driving a piece of shit\u201d), a declaration of allegiance to Arsenal (\u201cI hate Theo Walcott\u201d) and various other 140-character missives that go against him before we get to the ones that have come to the attention of the FA\u2019s disciplinary department.</p> <p>It might get even worse for Gray now it also turns out the charge sheet, covering an eight-week period from 9 January 2012, has been extended to include another tweet \u2013 beginning with the declaration \u201cI hate lightys!\u201d\u2013from July 2014, shortly after he had signed for Brentford from Luton. A \u201clighty\u201d is slang, often regarded as offensive, to describe a light-skinned person of mixed race. If you think back to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/17/rio-ferdinand-alex-ferguson-warned-twitter\">Rio Ferdinand\u2019s disciplinary case</a> for retweeting someone who had described Ashley Cole as a \u201cchoc-ice\u201d (meaning black on the outside, white on the inside) it is probably safe to assume Gray needs a good lawyer.</p> <p>Is it fair for Burnley to be punished for something that happened in the past and completely out of their control? Not in the slightest and it is easy to understand why the relevant people at Turf Moor are struggling to understand how the FA can punish tweets going back over four and a half years, starting when Gray was at Hinckley United, yet look the other way when it comes to the night Vardy took exception to the presence of a Japanese man at his local casino.</p> <p>In mitigation, there is also quite a bit of background to take into account in Gray\u2019s case and it is a shame, perhaps, that he did not offer more context in his statement asking for forgiveness and pointing out \u201cthankfully I am not the guy I was back then\u201d.</p> <p>That scar running diagonally from his left ear and all the way across his cheek is the legacy of being slashed with a knife in a street fight in Wolverhampton, around Christmas 2011. The most offensive tweets started a couple of weeks later and if Gray seemed angry with the world that was because he probably was. Gray\u2019s autobiography would certainly not be the average footballer\u2019s story. He grew up without a dad and, at 13, lost the grandfather, Terry, who had taken on the role of a father figure. After that, it was a story of gangs, violence and the kind of lifestyle most of us can barely contemplate. Some of the people he knocked around with have ended up dead and it was football, more than anything, that helped him come out the other side. So, yes, maybe he is a better human being at 25 than he was at 21. Maybe we can take it at face value and Gray, in 2016, is not the hate-filled individual he was in 2012.</p> <p>Unfortunately for the sport as a whole, it is more easy pickings for those armchair columnists who like to lament the elastic principles in Gray\u2019s profession compared to those of the people we saw competing in the Olympics. It actually works both ways \u2013 there are things football can learn from other sports, and vice versa \u2013 but Gray\u2019s tweets, historic or not, certainly go against the image the game likes to portray these days and it is not always easy knowing whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/mar/29/robbie-rogers-coming-out-gay\">Robbie Rogers</a>, formerly of Leeds United, coming out as gay in 2013 has changed everything as much as many people thought.</p> <p>It certainly did not feel that way, visiting one Premier League club recently, when the various community assignments were being shared out and seeing the horror of one of the squad \u2013 a high-profile player \u2013 when his name was put alongside an LGBT event. \u201cI can\u2019t do it,\u201d he said, as if someone had just asked him to bungee-jump off the top of a cliff. There was an attempt to talk him round \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s anti\u2011discrimination, not pro-homosexuality\u201d \u2013 but he looked terrified. To say he froze would be an understatement and, despite one more go to persuade him it didn\u2019t mean dressing up as one of the Village People, it soon became obvious it might be better all round to designate somebody else.</p> <p>It says something that the number of complaints to Kick it Out about homophobic abuse has actually gone up, not down, over three-fold in the last three seasons and you might have heard what happened last weekend when Rogers, playing for LA Galaxy II against Orange County Blues, claimed an opposition player had repeatedly called him a queer.</p> <p>The player in question? Richard Chaplow, Accrington-born and previously of Burnley, West Brom, Preston North End, Southampton, Millwall and Doncaster Rovers. Chaplow denied the accusation but admitted swearing <a href=\"http://www.uslsoccer.com/news_article/show/689979?referrer_id=2333971\">and was suspended for two matches</a> when a proven case would apparently have meant three. All of which makes an interesting comparison when on the same day Hope Solo, the USA women\u2019s team goalkeeper, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/26/hope-solo-suspension-female-athletes-double-standards\">was banned for six months</a> and her contract was terminated because she had complained about Sweden\u2019s defensive tactics in the Olympics and described them as a \u201cbunch of cowards\u201d.</p> <p>For Gray, the damage will be twofold. In football, it has always been easier getting a bad name than losing one and, if he is indeed a changed man, it isn\u2019t going to be a pleasant experience being tarnished by something he had probably long forgotten about. First, though, there is the likelihood of a long ban \u2013 Gray must respond to the charge by Wednesday evening \u2013 and it wouldn\u2019t hurt if he made efforts in that time to show the world he is sorry, stand up in front of the cameras and explain in detail how he has changed and why we should believe him. Much better that way than being a twit who tweets.</p> <h2>Wenger and Levy plans don\u2019t add up</h2> <p>For two clubs who would like us to believe they have high ambitions, it has not been easy understanding the transfer-market movements of Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur<strong> </strong>over the last few days.</p> <p>That was certainly a curious move, first of all, from Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, having made it clear all summer that he would not be pressured into spending, to go in for Lucas P\u00e9rez from Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a when this is a striker who has been on the market all summer without Arsenal thinking it warranted triggering his \u00a317m buyout clause.</p> <p>Leicester City<strong> </strong>were the first club to explore a potential move earlier in the summer on the say-so of Steve Walsh, their head of recruitment. Everton thought they had a transfer lined up when Walsh subsequently moved to Goodison and Wenger might have to understand the allegations of panic buying when, three weekends into the new season, Arsenal suddenly ambush the deal.</p> <p>Even more perplexing is why Tottenham left it so late to move for Wilfried Zaha if they were serious about trying to prise him away from Crystal Palace. After nothing all summer, was it sensible to wait until Yannick Bolasie had completed his move to Everton before putting in the call?</p> <p>Palace have just lost one of their better attacking players. They can hardly be blamed for not wanting another to go, especially with so little time to find a replacement before Wednesday\u2019s deadline.</p> <p>As for offering \u00a312m, did the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, seriously think that might clinch a deal in today\u2019s inflated market? Bolasie went for \u00a325m and Zaha, at 23, is four years younger and therefore a more valuable asset.</p> <p>Levy likes to think he operates by his own rules but it does make me wonder whether this is the best example yet of what he calls<strong> </strong>\u201cpragmatic player trading\u201d now the club have a new stadium to finance \u2013 or, to put it another way, trying to do everything on the cheap.</p> <h2>Sunderland are in Allardyce\u2019s debt</h2> <p>Ahead of the first international break of the season, I wonder if Sunderland\u2019s chairman, Ellis Short, and the club\u2019s media department might acknowledge now that it was all rather petty and unbecoming to announce Sam Allardyce had taken the England job in a clipped 49-word statement that did not wish him well or express any gratitude for the feat of escapology that kept them in the Premier League.</p> <p>When David Moyes subsequently took over at Sunderland, it was intriguing as well to see Short\u2019s eulogy for the new manager and the clear message that he would rather have had him than Allardyce in the first place. Moyes, he said, was \u201cmy No1 managerial target for the last five appointments, but his desire to honour existing contracts meant we were not able to bring him to Sunderland previously\u201d.</p> <p>One problem: Paolo Di Canio was sacked by Sunderland on 23 September 2013 and replaced a couple of weeks later by Gus Poyet. Do Sunderland really want us to believe their top target was a man three months into a six-year contract as Manchester United manager?</p>",

  "<p>During the febrile, topsy-turvy days after Britain voted to leave the European Union, there were plenty of tough messages from European leaders. But few sounded more uncompromising than the EU trade commissioner.</p> <p>A week after the result, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, Europe\u2019s lead trade negotiator, stated that the UK could not even begin discussing a trade deal until it had left the bloc. \u201cFirst you exit and then you negotiate the terms of the relationship,\u201d she told <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36682735\"><em>Newsnight</em></a>, opening up the prospect of the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy being left dangling for years. When the BBC interviewer suggested this would damage businesses in Britain and on the continent, her response was straightforward: \u201cYes, but the vote was very clear.\u201d</p> <p>Such plain speaking provoked fury among leading Brexiters. Conservative MP Liam Fox condemned her remarks as \u201cbizarre and stupid\u201d. While legally correct that Britain cannot sign a trade deal before it has left, by taking such a tough line against early negotiations, she walked into a political minefield.</p> <p>In a few months\u2019 time, Fox, since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/theresa-mays-cabinet-state-educated-but-mostly-male\">appointed Britain\u2019s secretary of state for international trade,</a> may find himself sitting opposite Malmstr\u00f6m. Nobody knows exactly how big a role the 48-year-old Swede will play in Brussels\u2019s team Brexit. Michel Barnier, the silver-haired former French foreign minister, has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/27/jean-claude-juncker-puts-michel-barnier-in-charge-brexit-talks\">given the task of leading Brexit talks</a> by European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. Meanwhile, Belgian diplomat <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/belgian-diplomat-to-head-eus-brexit-taskforce\">Didier Seeuws</a> is handling Brexit for his boss, European council president Donald Tusk. Another EU president, Martin Schulz of the European parliament, is unlikely to stay quiet, as MEPs have a vote on the UK divorce and any subsequent trade deal.</p> <p>If the cooks are in Brussels, the master chefs are in Berlin, Paris and other national capitals. Anyone negotiating a future EU-UK trade deal is going to find many political leaders looking over their shoulders, says Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy. The British deal will not be a normal trade negotiation, akin to Vietnam or Canada, he stresses. \u201cMember states are going to play a far more prominent role in defining the ambitions or the objectives of where these negotiations land.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Swedish commissioner has plenty more on her plate: she wants to conclude a deal on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, better known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ttip\">TTIP, the most controversial trade deal the EU has ever negotiated</a>. Talks will reach a moment of truth in the autumn as both sides strive for an agreement before President Barack Obama leaves office.</p> <p>But doubts are mounting about whether a deal is possible. To critics, TTIP is a charter for deregulation that threatens the NHS. EU and US officials say the reality has become buried under myths and strenuously reject charges of secret negotiations.</p> <p>\u201cShe is very open and transparent in what we are doing,\u201d says one EU source close to the commissioner, who cites Malmstr\u00f6m\u2019s decision to publish EU negotiating positions after the talks. \u201cWe have taken transparency quite far. It is not on our interest to take it much further because we would be bad negotiators.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c6b6415c3b592d013a7d2b648341d0b705aa3fbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6b6415c3b592d013a7d2b648341d0b705aa3fbc/1376_0_2364_2955/800.jpg\" alt=\"Liam Fox, now Britain\u2019s secretary of state for international trade.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liam Fox, now Britain\u2019s secretary of state for international trade, was incensed by Malmstr\u00f6m\u2019s comments on Newsnight after the Brexit vote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although not exactly unusual, the volume of criticism is a far cry from Malmstr\u00f6m\u2019s early political days. As a member of the European parliament between 1999-2006, Malmstr\u00f6m was a hero of the liberal left, known for taking a firm stance against sweeping data-retention proposals.</p> <p>She was one of the \u201cwarrior parliamentarians\u201d in the parliament\u2019s liberal group, recalls Teresa K\u00fcchler, a reporter at Swedish daily <em>Svenska Dagbladet</em>. \u201cWhen she became a commissioner, everyone thought she shut up very quickly,\u201d she says, noting how carefully Malmstr\u00f6m avoided criticising decisions taken by EU governments. Cautious maybe. But not a dry-as-dust technocrat, who floats above politics. \u201cShe is known for being a liberal, above all, with not a drop of conservatism in her,\u201d K\u00fcchler adds. Mats Karlsson, director of the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, describes her outlook as the politics of the \u201cdecent middle\u201d, the big tent of Swedish Labour and centrists who came of age during \u201cthe golden age of globalisation and Europeanisation\u201d.</p> <p>Malmstr\u00f6m is also a true European. She was born in Gothenburg, Sweden\u2019s earthier second city, home to Volvo and Swedish manufacturing. Swedes can hear this in her accent, the Gothenburg lilt associated with banter and down-to-earth common sense. \u201cEven if she had been a politician for 100 years, she still comes across as a local, clever woman that we can be proud of,\u201d says K\u00fcchler, a fellow Gothenburger.</p> <p>Like so many Swedes, Malmstr\u00f6m speaks impeccable English. She is fluent in French and Spanish, comfortable in German and Italian. She spent part of her childhood in France and completed a PhD in Catalan and Italian regional politics. She studied literature at the Sorbonne in Paris and is as likely to have the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/elena-ferrante\">Elena Ferrante</a> novel in her bag as she is the TTIP text on public procurement rules.</p> <p>After stints as a Gothenburg town hall official and political science lecturer, she was soon climbing the ladder of Swedish politics, elected to the European parliament in 1999, aged 31.</p> <p>Like her friend and fellow liberal Nick Clegg, a career in the European parliament was a springboard into national politics. But, in Malmstr\u00f6m\u2019s case, not for long. After four years as Europe minister in Sweden\u2019s liberal centre-right coalition, she returned to Brussels as Sweden\u2019s European commissioner. She was put in charge of home affairs, a demanding portfolio covering asylum and terrorism that makes, but mostly breaks, reputations. This was a difficult job. Every year, more people were setting off in rickety boats from north Africa hoping to reach the Italian island of Lampedusa. Every year, more were dying. In October 2013, disaster struck. At least 366 people drowned less than half a mile from Lampedusa when their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/22/lampedusa-boat-tragedy-migrants-africa\">overcrowded fishing boat capsized</a>. As EU commissioner, Malmstr\u00f6m urged governments to do more. Italy set up the Mare Nostrum search-and-rescue operation, which was credited with saving 400 lives a day, although operations were later drastically scaled down. But she was far less successful in persuading EU countries to share responsibility for refugees, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/european-commission-urges-eu-backing-for-visa-free-travel-for-turks-ankara\">a divisive issue which has only grown more rancorous</a>.</p> <p>Malmstr\u00f6m returned to Brussels for a second term, under Juncker, and took over EU trade policy, amid growing scepticism about big corporations in the wake of the economic crisis.</p> <p>Karlsson thinks his compatriot will be clearly focused on European interest when it comes to Brexit. \u201cI think she will be a very hard negotiator in that we did not create this problem, this was a problem created by Britain.\u201d</p> <p>Reflecting a fairly widespread view among pro-European Swedes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/07/herman-van-rompuy-uk-free-movement-single-market-eu\">and beyond</a>, he said: \u201cBritain can only get a bad deal, a very bad deal ,or a catastrophic deal.

  "<p>It happens just about weekly, said Dr G Sealy Massingill. A woman comes to the Fort Worth hospital where he works as an OB-GYN. She is pregnant, she has diabetes. He treats her for both. She delivers a healthy baby. </p> <p>And then, nothing. Perhaps the problem is the end of her pregnancy spells the end of her insurance coverage. Perhaps she has no means of childcare to slip away for an appointment. Whatever the reason, the outcome is too often the same, said Massingill. \u201cThey just vanish.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/23/texas-maternal-death-rate-mothers-reproductive-healthcare\">Politics is killing mothers in Texas | Jessica Valenti</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the past week, back-to-back reports have sounded piercing alarms about a crisis of maternal mortality in Texas. The first report, which appears in next month\u2019s issue of the academic journal Obstetrics and Gynecology, found that the rate of maternal mortality had crept up across the United States but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/texas-maternal-mortality-rate-health-clinics-funding\">doubled in Texas</a> in a matter of just two years. The leap in death rates for new and expectant mothers, said the report\u2019s authors, was hard to explain \u201cin the absence of war, natural disaster, or severe economic upheaval\u201d.<br></p> <p>As Texas reeled from that report, the state\u2019s maternal mortality prevention task force released another confirming that the rate of maternal deaths was rising and a single group was suffering with wild disproportionality: black women, who accounted for 11.4% of births in Texas in 2011 and 2012, but 28.8% of deaths linked to pregnancy. The task force also found a worrisome rate of maternal morbidity, in which a woman nearly died from pregnancy-related causes and may be left with a major impairment.</p> <p>Now, public health advocates are straining for possible explanations. Massingill points to these women who fall through the cracks at an alarming rate due to lack of health care coverage or the basic struggles of poverty. </p> <p>\u201cWe see these patients\u201d \u2013 and then, suddenly, stop seeing these patients \u2013 \u201cevery day,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day.\u201d</p> <p>And there are other hypotheses. Was it dramatic cuts to the state\u2019s system of family planning clinic? The state\u2019s large population of undocumented women, who struggle to obtain health insurance? Or its state-of-the-art hospitals, which accept complicated maternal cases from all over the American southwest and South and Central America?<br></p> <p>Several have hypothesized that the surge in deaths is not a surge at all, but the true rate of maternal mortality in Texas, only now being exposed because the state has expanded the way it captures mortality data. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/01/anti-abortion-laws-legislation-clinics-dangerous-methods\">After wave of anti-abortion laws, US sees signs of women taking drastic measures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other experts are puzzled by the changing composition of factors that cause maternal deaths. Cardiac events and drug overdoses make up the biggest causes of deaths that can be linked to pregnancy in Texas, eclipsing more familiar causes such as eclampsia and hemorrhage. Women in the United States have grown far more likely to deliver by caesarian section compared to previous decades, and each successive C-section entails a greater risk of complication.</p> <p>But for the time being, most admit that no one knows what\u2019s happening.</p> <p>\u201cWe rarely actually see a patient die from maternal death in our practice,\u201d said Dr John Jennings, an OB-GYN in the Houston area. If one of his patients were to die from maternal causes, he continued, it might happen from a major cardiac event that takes place months after he has stopped treating her.</p> <p>One problem may be that in Texas, many poor women are only eligible for Medicaid coverage during their pregnancy and for a prescribed period of time after they give birth.</p> <p>\u201cOnce the baby is born, there\u2019s not a big commitment in our state to protecting the mother,\u201d Massingill said. Programs for new mothers lack enough providers because of poor reimbursement rates, and the biggest impact falls on poor women who are uninsured. \u201cThey have very excellent care during their pregnancy, but when they stop being pregnant, they lose that coverage.\u201d</p> <p>Doctors across the state say they care for these at-risk patients as best they can while they\u2019re still covered. </p> <p>Dr Raymond Moss Hampton, an OB-GYN at the<em> </em>Texas Tech University health sciences center and the Lubbock General Hospital, said doctors in his departments have begun to shift their protocols, screening more aggressively for high blood pressure and more tightly regimenting their care of women with heart disease. Still, many deteriorate after giving birth.</p> <p>\u201cWe recently had one lady who had pulmonary hypertension die about six months after delivery in our emergency room,\u201d said Hampton. \u201cIt\u2019s very traumatic for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time maternal mortality appears to be rising, the state\u2019s network of clinics that screen women for reproductive health problems and provide low-cost contraception is contracting. It is a crisis, said Jennings, of the state\u2019s own making. In 2011, the Texas legislature cut about two-thirds from the state\u2019s family planning budget of $111.5m, causing some 80 family planning clinics to shut down. The Republican-controlled statehouse also maneuvered to exclude Planned Parenthood, a major provider of STI and cancer screenings, well-woman exams, and contraception, from using state and federal funds to subsidize these services for poor women.</p> <p>Doctors and the two reports differ on whether the jump in maternal deaths can be directly linked to these cuts. But what is clear is that the state has yet to recover the capacity to provide reproductive health care with new programs.</p> <p>\u201cWe have had a destruction, in part, of our ability to take care of contraceptive issues,\u201d said Jennings. \u201cThose issues have got to be overcome, and those are issues that are Texas-specific, because we kind of led the way in passing those laws.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, Sealy says, those lost patients he hasn\u2019t seen since their pregnancy do reappear again \u2013 for their next pregnancy, or, in his emergency room.</p> <p>\u201cYou see them back again, in worse shape, and they have had a real disaster befall them since their last pregnancy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it gets worse and worse and worse.\u201d</p>",

Once this first section is completed, mappers will make a guide and upload a GPS track ready for use in the autumn. \u201cThe plan is to finish the 200km section, have a guide, get it out there and get people hiking it,\u201d says Paul.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve tried to make it less of a cow path and more of an easy-to-follow hiking trail</p> <footer> <cite>Paul Stephens, Transcaucasian Trail co-founder</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The TCT will open up largely unexplored areas, giving access to historic sites and protected areas, such as Ushguli, the highest permanently inhabited village in Europe.

And so we stood again like two little girls, one who had lost her Dad and one who was losing hers to Parkinson\u2019s and Dementia. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c5e7a684e5f60f00e14341b22439ca61278e242\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c5e7a684e5f60f00e14341b22439ca61278e242/25_0_750_450/500.jpg\" alt=\"Lesley with her friend Deborah\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lesley with her friend Deborah</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two years later Deborah was my maid of honour when I married my childhood sweetheart.

In February, I sat by him as he passed away from complications of motor neurone disease. <br></p> <p>After leaving school, all I wanted to do was play music for the rest of my life. My parents had grander plans, and I trundled off reluctantly to medical school. Kenny Silke\u2019s parents raised him with softer hands, and by the time I met him, some time in 1973, he was leading a charmed life as a jobbing musician. We formed a band, and in doing so initiated a special bond which long outlasted the group\u2019s glory days. My parents never said a word about the racket coming up from the rehearsal room, or the many lectures I skipped for the love of music.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"889857d24ca38d67264ae8d6bbcd5f0ddd09f9ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/889857d24ca38d67264ae8d6bbcd5f0ddd09f9ff/3_0_993_596/500.jpg\" alt=\"David Bass on the left, Kenny on the right: \u201cThis was a publicity shot for our 30th anniversary reunion of Feedback in 2009.

But until his last laboured breath, he remained exactly the same person he\u2019d always been, his final gesture being the smile with which he\u2019d greeted me all those years before in a dank dance-hall reeking of beer and cigarettes. He was such a life-changer, and I miss him every day.<br><strong>David Bass, 63, Cape Town, South Africa</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Neither of us regard nationality as a barrier to friendship\u2019</h2> <p>Ulrike and I took part in a school exchange when we were 15 \u2013 we were matched up by our interests and it couldn\u2019t have been more perfect. She spent three weeks with me in my very English grammar school and we travelled back to Frankfurt where I had three wonderful weeks with her family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6ce9cd32b895a4c3dde216d82e6146c623d100d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6ce9cd32b895a4c3dde216d82e6146c623d100d/15_108_884_530/500.jpg\" alt=\"Pam Ward with her friend Ulrike 1963.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pam Ward with her friend Ulrike 1963.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pam Ward</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We bonded immediately and have met frequently over the years. Both of us had an interest in politics and have corresponded on a personal level but also discussed many other issues in letters and emails, the most recent being that of Brexit. Both of us for different reasons and from different cultures regarded the decision to leave the EU as a major mistake.</p> <p>We will always remain friends. Neither of us regard nationality as a barrier to friendship; quite the reverse. <br><strong>Pam Ward, Sheffield</strong></p> <h2>\u2018A 53 year age gap seems odd, but our friendship has taught me so much\u2019</h2> <p>My best friend is 70 years old, loves Elvis and open plan kitchens. Irene was also, oddly, my childminder. Her husband suffered from MS and died of cancer 21 years ago, and she then took up looking after my brother. Irene seems to have this odd thing where she is a compulsive carer. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5ebaad848de174690ff99de620977d81322640c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ebaad848de174690ff99de620977d81322640c2/0_0_1280_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Niamh and Irene on the way to Irene\u2019s 70th birthday celebrations.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Niamh and Irene on the way to Irene\u2019s 70th birthday celebrations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niamh Browne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve known her since the day I was born \u2013 every day she would pick me up from school and then I would go to her house and have soup and waffles and watch Friends. I know a 56 year age gap seems odd, but honestly our friendship has taught me so much more about the world than the relationships with any of my friends who are my peers. I think it\u2019s the time and constant unconditional love she has shown me that has made our friendship so strong. Irene is the kindest and most organised person I know. Her constant routine and structure has allowed me to be as creative, unstructured and carefree \u2013 I would be lost without her. I think I make her less uptight, and she makes me less disastrous.<br><strong>Niamh Browne, 17, Cork</strong></p> <h2>\u2018It took weeks before the ice broke, but once it had there was no stopping us\u2019</h2> <p>Gaea Todd has been my best friend for over 30 years, since I was seven \u2013 she\u2019s a year older than me and is the Godmother of my 17-year-old daughter; I am the same to her two-year-old son. <br></p> <p>In 1985 my mother, my brothers and sister and I moved to Kilburn, North London. We moved from a house where we\u2019d suffered racial abuse to a house my mother still lives in today. I remember the day my she sent me over to go and play with the children next door \u2013 she made me put on a red dress before I went so that I looked respectable, but I hated wearing it. Gaea\u2019s mum and sister welcomed me with open arms, Gaea, on the other hand, just looked me up and down and carried on watching TV. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fffbc1d8bbc4c59549d36043b741752207e1474e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fffbc1d8bbc4c59549d36043b741752207e1474e/0_7_604_362/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ekua McMorris with her friend Gaea Todd.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ekua McMorris with her friend Gaea Todd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ekua McMorris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It took some weeks before the ice broke between us, but once it had, there was no stopping us.

Her mother and mine are still good friends after all these years.<br><strong>Ekua McMorris, 38, London <br></strong></p> <h2> \u2018I believe that our sexuality doesn\u2019t define our friendship\u2019</h2> <p>Louise and I have been friends for fifteen years this summer. We met when I was 15 and she 16 at a gay youth group called <a href=\"http://www.allsortsyouth.org.uk/\">Allsorts</a> in Brighton, England. The alternative look was \u201cin\u201d then, and I thought Louise was really cool with her baggy jeans, chains and beads. I\u2019m not sure what she thought about me \u2013 probably that I had a bad haircut but seemed quite funny. <br></p> <p>We started spending time together outside of the youth group \u2013 going to see bands, experimenting with underage drinking, and sneaking into clubs. Exploring Brighton\u2019s gay scene with Louise was the highlight of my teenage years. One summer we practically never spent a day apart and throughout our late teens I recall many days spent hungover at her parents house. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9cf3a5885f16516ab845ca6f3359d03abc0c576\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9cf3a5885f16516ab845ca6f3359d03abc0c576/0_0_960_960/500.jpg\" alt=\"Claire, on the left, who now lives in Vancouver, with her friend Louise.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claire, on the left, who now lives in Vancouver, with her friend Louise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claire</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We were both in London for University, albeit opposite ends of the city, and yet still found time to spend together among new friends, deadlines and exams. Post-graduation I moved back to Brighton and Louise stayed in the capital. We continued to see each other every few months and always looked for opportunities to relive our teenage years and go out clubbing or to see bands.<br></p> <p>Louise is incredibly patient and has guided me through some questionable relationships. Our bond is really strong because we share a similar sense of humour. I admire Louise\u2019s work ethic and passion for her craft. She\u2019s a successful freelance illustrator and every time I see her work in print or online I feel incredibly proud of what she\u2019s achieved.<br></p> <p>Eight months ago I made a huge life-changing decision to relocate to Vancouver, Canada. Louise came with me to the airport and was the last person I hugged goodbye before going through the gate. She\u2019ll be my first visitor later this year, too. <br></p> <p>Our friendship started because we both knew we were gay at a young age. However I believe that our sexuality doesn\u2019t define our friendship; it\u2019s merely a coincidence. I think finding someone who is into a lot of the same things you are, shares similar values and morals, and has a fantastic sense of humour is rare and should be cherished. <strong><br>Claire, 30, Vancouver \u2013 originally from Brighton</strong><br></p> <h2>\u2018Our friendship is older than our marriages and children\u2019</h2> <p>I have two oldest friends and would not want to choose. We have known each other for over 50 years: Jane for 54 years and Marjorie for 53.<br></p> <p>Marj is a qualified librarian and Jane a teacher. We grew up in 60s Manchester and took advantage of the cultural and social scene there. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"63b3d3b332323c804e20fa6536a050470574b119\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63b3d3b332323c804e20fa6536a050470574b119/25_128_502_301/500.jpg\" alt=\"Valerie with her two friends\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Valerie with her two friends</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valerie Stevens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We all worked for a trade and technical publishing company in Manchester, which must have been one of the most wacky places to work. We were all keen not to slot into the \u2018married at 21, get a mortgage and two children\u2019 sort of life that seemed like the only option for many women at the time. <br></p> <p>We have breaks in our friendship but always kept those links that have endured. We wanted something else in our lives and we have all achieved that in our different ways \u2013 we\u2019re all married now and have five children between us, two of us living in France and the other a frequent visitor.</p> <p>Our friendship is older than our marriages and children and I cannot imagine my life without either one. We are the witnesses to the narratives of our lives as others have disappeared along the way, and they\u2019ve supported me through life traumas including serious illness and bereavement. </p> <p>Three years ago we had a grand celebration in Manchester to mark our 50 years of friendship. Two of us travelled from France for the event. We had lunch at a top restaurant, then visited our old workplace and went to a feminist book launch before spending a fantastic night at the Dolly Parton musical. More recently I have had a health scare resulting in an operation in July and waiting for results to assess if more serious. One stayed with me the beginning and the other supported me after the operation. Friends for life. <br><strong>Val Stevens, France, 71</strong></p> <h2>\u2018He was top of the class, I was bottom\u2019</h2> <p>When I saw David at my wedding last year, we realised that this September would mark 25 years since we met. I thought that a quarter-century of friendship deserved a celebration, so I\u2019ve just been to visit David [Burn \u2013 a professor of early music at KU Leuven] in Belgium for five days \u2013 I\u2019m writing this on a train during the final leg of my journey home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"907022eb7e0356791adfc42f75bf6ec517012589\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/907022eb7e0356791adfc42f75bf6ec517012589/0_169_1229_738/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Allen, right, with his friend David and the latter\u2019s daughter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Allen, right, with his friend David and the latter\u2019s daughter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Allen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We met having both just left school to go to college in Nottingham. We both enrolled on a music course but came from very different musical backgrounds \u2013 I\u2019d started as a club organist, playing the working men\u2019s club circuit, whilst David played harpsichord and studied ancient music. He was a shoe-in for the course, whereas I got in by the skin of my teeth. In the first term exams, he was top of the class, I was bottom. We formed a friendship based on a shared inquisitiveness, and we were firm friends throughout our time there. David got a scholarship to Oxford, and I went to university in Yorkshire. We saw each other as often as we could whilst undergraduates \u2013 we both found university life lonely, and neither of us found friends that shared the same close bond we\u2019d formed between us. When I graduated, I stayed in Yorkshire. David stayed in Oxford for his master\u2019s, and then his PhD. We saw each other as often as we could, but this became more and more difficult with the passing of time. It never seemed to matter though \u2013 we always picked up exactly as we\u2019d left off. </p> <p>We\u2019ve had an incredible time reminiscing over the last 25 years together, and even going back and playing through the piano duets and songs we learned at college \u2013 over 20 years have passed since we last played or sang together, and it came flooding back as though it was yesterday. <br><strong>Timothy Allen, 41, choir director from Barnsley</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Neither time nor distance has any corrosive effect on our friendship\u2019<br></h2> <p>Mike \u2018Oz\u2019 Owen is my oldest friend \u2013 I\u2019ve known him since we were 5 years old, 47 years ago and he is essentially the brother I never had. I live in Wiltshire but he lives in Brighton, working as a lighting designer for big-name acts such as Beyonce and Madonna. <br></p> <p>We don\u2019t need to see or speak or e-mail each other regularly \u2013 we just pick-up after six months or so; neither time nor distance has any corrosive effect.We just understand each other \u2013 have the same perspectives on life and the same values.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He spoke knowingly of me as only a friend could</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He, like me hails from a working class background and we both seemed unusual in our growing-up in not wanting to live locally and get a job in the local factory. We both made it to university in the 80s when few from backgrounds like ours even had that expectation. We both sought to \u2018escape\u2019 our roots and live independently and seek out experiences. <br></p> <p>I can share any problem I have without fear of judgement from Oz. He offers sane counsel and has helped me financially in times of need. I know that I can simply turn-up at his if I need refuge \u2013 which I have done in the past. He will sympathise, listen and share a possible solution. <br></p> <p>Having been a \u2018best man\u2019 at a wedding, I didn\u2019t want to burden him with that role, seeking to protect him from the labor of the speech. On the day, without my knowledge, Oz stood-up at our wedding reception and spoke beautifully from the heart, braving something that I know would have been uncomfortable to him. He spoke knowingly of me as only a friend could. I was deeply touched. We have travelled together, had minor adventures together, gone to gigs, played guitar together and tried to fathom what it\u2019s all about together for the last 47 years, swapping field-notes from life as we go on. It \u2018aint over yet but I know that one of us will be speaking at the other\u2019s funeral.<strong><br>John Randall, 52, Devizes, Wiltshire </strong><strong><br></strong></p>",
  "<p>One day, when he was 25 years old, Park Sang-hak was strolling around a huge square in the North Korean port of Wonsan. It is a drab place, with just a few flags and painted propaganda posters providing splashes of colour. But, as a trusted party worker and the son of a top spy, Park had been given rare dispensation to travel to the city along the bumpy roads from the capital, Pyongyang, and he had made plans to see a friend from university.</p> <p>The pair talked animatedly as they walked around on that autumnal day in 1993. This was a break from the usual repetitive routine of life in the world\u2019s most repressive nation: ceaseless work broken by Monday political classes and Saturday self-criticism sessions. The square was packed as they mingled with men in spartan clothes and women with regulation hairstyles. They passed an imposing statue of Kim Il-sung, the state\u2019s founder, who landed in the city after its postwar liberation from Japan. Suddenly, they saw hundreds of leaflets raining down from the sky.</p> <p>\u201cThere were about 800 people there and just five security men, so I grabbed one and put it quickly in my pocket,\u201d recalls Park, now 48, showing me how fast he stuffed away the piece of paper as we chat over fruit in a Seoul cafe. His friend was too scared to do the same; they could have faced party expulsion, exile to the countryside, even execution. Later, they read the story on the leaflet about a family of defectors who had fled to South Korea, and looked with wonder at pictures of escaped women in bikinis on a beach.</p> <p>The flyer was sent by the South as part of a propaganda war being waged on both sides of the divided nation. Once, Park would have been sceptical about its message: he was from a privileged family and had been told since birth that his great leaders were wise, their nation the world\u2019s finest, that jealous enemies such as South Korea and the US sought to overthrow their glorious system. When, as a teenager, he discovered a neighbouring family had disappeared in the night, he was disturbed, but he accepted they must have done wrong.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/jul/03/pyongyang-holds-rally-in-honour-of-north-korean-leader-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4njmj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2592937\"            data-video-name=\"Pyongyang holds rally in honour of North Korean leader \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5778ef95e4b0794b412fbf37\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/07/03/160793nkorea_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317612&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317612&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317612&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317612&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/jul/03/pyongyang-holds-rally-in-honour-of-north-korean-leader-video\">Pyongyang holds rally in honour of North Korean leader</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>But first Park\u2019s grandmother, on a rare visit from Japan, told him how much happier people seemed in other places, although he warned her against spreading rumours about the regime. Then fellow students, chosen to study in communist countries, whispered stories about life outside. \u201cOne had been to Berlin, where he had access to the west. I was shocked to learn some people had free access, since, if you travelled to South Korea and were caught, you went to a concentration camp. And I discovered in Europe people did not have weekly self-evaluation sessions [where citizens must confess to \u2018wrongdoings\u2019], which were a source of great stress for our people.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, as a young bureaucrat rising in the system, Park had no desire to leave; not until one day in the summer of 1999, when he received a message from a Chinese man. He had come on behalf of Park\u2019s father, who was working in Japan for the government. His father had realised the family were in danger; he wanted them to leave. \u201cThis was the moment my dreams crashed,\u201d Park says. \u201cI was sad and scared, but I knew I had no choice.\u201d As entire families are held culpable for offences, he says, \u201cIf I stayed, I would be sent to a prison camp, since my father was not coming back.\u201d</p> <p>His father had discovered the horrific scale of famine in North Korea and feared fresh purges. Huge numbers had starved to death due to the loss of financial aid after the collapse of the Soviet Union, followed by a series of natural disasters. But even to say the word \u201cfamine\u201d was a crime, because it implied state failure. Park, suspecting a trap, demanded proof that the message was genuine, asking for photographs of his father. This took two months to arrange, \u201cbut felt like 20 years\u201d. A week later, he bribed a border guard to defect across the Yalu river to China with his mother, brother and sister.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b254e6e542f815d213fd3a0d5a6120515d17878\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b254e6e542f815d213fd3a0d5a6120515d17878/0_1672_4002_4328/925.jpg\" alt=\"Park Sang-hak portrait\" width=\"925\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was sad and scared, but I knew I had no choice\u2019: Park Sang-hak fled after his father defected to Japan and sent news home about the scale of famine in North Korea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jun Michael Park/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the first weeks of a new century, he arrived in Seoul, aged 32, to start his new life.

Often, they struggle to settle in a world they find so strange, with its personal freedoms and paralysing choice. They are, after all, emerging from an Orwellian land where life is determined by a rigid hierarchy dependent upon family history, where the state controls everything under a despotic dynasty that has ruled though three generations since 1948.</p> <p>Today, this diminutive man dedicates his life to bringing down the brutal regime that brainwashed him and 25 million fellow citizens. Park quit his job in 2003 after learning his fiancee had been beaten so badly following his escape that she was left unrecognisable, that his two uncles had been tortured to death and that his teenage cousins were reduced to street begging. \u201cI had to do something,\u201d he says. \u201cI was mad that these innocent people had been tortured and killed.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Park - dubbed 'enemy zero' - has survived an assassination attempt by an agent armed with a torch that fired bullets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Park does not fight with bombs and bullets, but with flyers such as the one that once floated down beside him. This year, he has dispatched 2m leaflets attacking the dictatorship in homemade balloons sent across the barbed-wire border. The leaflets are sent in packages alongside dollars, declarations of human rights, booklets about South Korea, sweets, soap operas and even comic films such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/12/the-interview-review-stoned-anally-fixated-funny\">The Interview</a> that ridicule North Korea\u2019s leadership. Park believes that information can break down the walls of the world\u2019s toughest totalitarian state and that truth can free citizens from their cocoon of total censorship.</p> <p>\u201cAll defectors ask the same question: how could our country lie so completely to us?\u201d he says when we meet again two days later. It is a cloudy July night and we are driving to Gimpo, by the North Korean border, so he can send over 10 balloons, 150,000 leaflets, $2,000 (\u00a31,500) in cash and a cartoon banner mocking \u201csupreme leader\u201d Kim Jong-un. Park\u2019s team \u2013 comprising his wife, his brother and his sister-in-law \u2013 work silently but systematically as they fill agricultural tubes with hydrogen, then release them with dangling parcels attached. \u201cObviously, we have no idea how many get in,\u201d Park says, \u201cbut at least there is no risk to people smuggling the information in.\u201d</p> <p>Watching the balloons disappear into the night, it is hard not to think that these are flimsy weapons with which to fight the maverick nuclear power that lies a mile north. Yet Park\u2019s missions seem to have stung North Korea. He has been named \u201cEnemy Zero\u201d. Five years ago, he survived an assassination attempt by an agent armed with two poison-tipped pens and a torch that fired bullets. The would-be killer asked to meet, but the police went in his place; now Park has permanent bodyguards. Missiles have been fired back over the border in response to his balloon launches, and at times of tension South Korea has deployed the police to prevent his efforts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25ebded0e11760e944d3d26c92b15af4c747fb6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25ebded0e11760e944d3d26c92b15af4c747fb6c/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"North Korea banner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Park launches a banner across the border, which reads: \u2018Humanity condemns Kim Jung-un, who squeezes blood out of the people and fires Musudan ballistic missiles.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jun Michael Park/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Park is far from alone. Dozens more defectors, dismayed by international inertia towards a dictatorship that enslaved an entire population for seven decades, are trying to topple tyranny with similar tactics. Aided by non-profit organisations such as the New York-based <a href=\"https://humanrightsfoundation.org\">Human Rights Foundation</a>, activists are using drones to send memory sticks from China loaded with books, encyclopedias and films. Others bribe border guards or use boats and fishermen to send banned data, documentaries and radios.</p> <p>The risks are high: three women were executed after being caught circulating a South Korean drama about a defector last November. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/kim-jong-un\">Kim Jong\u2011un</a> has cracked down hard to consolidate his position since becoming leader five years ago, and only two of the other seven people who stood beside his father\u2019s coffin are still thought to be alive. He has toughened border controls, warning that people who aid illegal crossings face the death penalty and offering rewards for soldiers who stop them. Those with cash and luck can still get through, but in the past two years alone the cost has doubled to $14,000 (\u00a311,000).</p> <p>In such a closed culture, even the most banal items can seem revolutionary. One prominent defector told me how watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/05/titanic-review\">Titanic</a> made her realise the restrictive nature of North Korea and the real meaning of love. Another described being transfixed by Chinese television commercials for products she had never seen before, such as bottled water. A third man told me how he smuggled in DVDs of Desperate Housewives \u2013 its glossy view of life in the US runs counter to the official line. A fourth was fascinated by Jane Eyre, so different from the censored version shorn of any sexual frisson or societal critiques.</p> <p>For five years, Kim Heung-kwang was among the party cadres seeking to stem the flow of such seditious material. A computer-science professor at Hamhung University, he was recruited to join the state censorship team and study seized electronic devices. He went on searches, took bribes from terrified families and confiscated \u201ccapitalist\u201d materials. Afterwards, he would read captured books and watch banned films at his leisure, then lend them to friends \u2013 until the day he was denounced in 2003. He was tortured, stripped of his post and sent to work on a farm. Thanks to his wealth, however, he was able to flee the country a year later.</p> <p>Arriving in South Korea, Kim sought to subvert the system he had once followed so fervently by setting up a group of intellectual defectors. He made videos, such as one showing the inside of a bookshop that told viewers to look at the number of volumes on sale; another featured taps with hot and cold water, so rare north of the border. He loaded them on to \u201cstealth\u201d memory sticks, designed to seem empty if checked by officials, along with books and essays. Thousands were sent through secret smuggling pipelines that date back to the deadly famine two decades ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e48b49cdfb395c60ea4dc1640575460e4eae0f78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e48b49cdfb395c60ea4dc1640575460e4eae0f78/0_380_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Heung-kwang\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former party cadre Kim Heung-kwang served in North Korea\u2019s cyber unit, but fled after being denounced.

We meet in a downtown cafe. She has cropped hair, several earrings and a ready smile. Her mother was a doctor and her father taught the accordion. Like many elite North Koreans, the family bought illegal items that gave glimpses into the wider world. \u201cWe would listen to music, although we didn\u2019t know it was from a couple of decades ago,\u201d she recalls.</p> <p>She was arrested more than a decade ago as the result of investigations into the family of a close friend. \u201cThe police would interrogate me, asking again and again if I listened to foreign music and films. They would get friends to testify against me that I was the ringleader and smuggling videos, then beat me for days until I admitted it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When it comes to overthrowing the government, I don't think it's possible. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After confessing her \u201ccrimes\u201d, Jung was sentenced to eight years in prison, which, due to forced labour and poor food, can often be a death sentence. Her family were able to use their connections to get her out after a year, claiming that she suffered a severe illness. They smuggled her to China as soon as she was released, but the broker they paid to get her over the border sold her as a slave. The young woman was sent to the countryside, forced to work in fields and barely fed before escaping months later for South Korea.</p> <p>Now Jung has joined the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_People%27s_Liberation_Front\">North Korean People\u2019s Liberation Front</a>, a quasi-military group in the South, waging information war against the Kim regime and preparing for its collapse. Although not armed, its members wear fatigues and its logo is a map of Korea with a gunsight targeting Pyongyang. \u201cWhen it comes to overthrowing the government, I don\u2019t think it is possible,\u201d admits Choi Jung-hoon, its affable commander, despite claims of links to army dissidents over the border. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t try. I want to slowly change the situation there.\u201d</p> <p>The group claims to have smuggled in thousands of notels \u2013 cheap, battery-powered, Chinese-made devices that play DVDs and content stored on memory sticks. Although recently legalised in North Korea, they are meant to be registered, so that use can be monitored. Choi shows me pictures of USBs hidden in popular biscuits and sweet wrappers. Few citizens own computers \u2013 which have their own operating system, \u201cRed Star\u201d, and control access to what one defector calls \u201cvery boring\u201d state-run websites \u2013 but most have access to television.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdc9413aff34171317ddc517a968f2c90b631ab5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdc9413aff34171317ddc517a968f2c90b631ab5/0_1440_4002_4560/878.jpg\" alt=\"Choi Jung-hoon\" width=\"878\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Choi Jung-hoon, commander of the North Korean People\u2019s Liberation Front.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jun Michael Park/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Choi was an army officer in North Korea\u2019s cyber-hacking unit for nearly 20 years, before leaving, almost by accident, in 2006. After hearing that a South Korean family was offering a $10,000 reward for contact with a kidnapped man, he searched the North to find him, successfully. But when he took the man to China to claim his reward, the family held a press conference and revealed publicly what Choi had done. \u201cThe regime ordered my execution,\u201d Choi says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go back.\u201d Two years ago, he survived an attempt on his life by a female agent posing as a defector.</p> <p>We speak in the group\u2019s Seoul headquarters, a nondescript office with its logo on the wall and so many pairs of army boots under the table I have to push back my chair to sit down. He admits that, when he was forced out of the country, he was filled with regret \u2013 his family was successful, his career was thriving and he had no reason to doubt the dominant ideology. \u201cI never realised how horrifying the regime was that I defended,\u201d he says intensely. \u201cBut the more you believe in something, the more you feel betrayed when you see through it. Finding out what the government had been doing changed my life. That\u2019s why I work so hard to get information in.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>More than two-thirds of the 28,000 defectors in South Korea are women, most of whom endured terrible traumas after fleeing. Many others are trapped in China, forced into marriage or slave labour, at risk of repatriation if caught. If they are sent back, they face abuse from prison guards or are sent to work in mines or political camps. Suicide rates are high among defectors, even in the South. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34710403\">Official figures indicate that one in seven defector deaths are suicides</a> \u2013 a legacy of abuse, the impact on family members left behind and the struggle to survive in a free society.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even if women in North Korea are sexually abused or raped, they do not know that these are violations of their rights</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This inspired <a href=\"http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/issues/2016/04/178_203015.html\">Lee So-yeon</a>, 40, to fight for fellow North Korean female defectors. A former soldier, Lee worked as a cleaner after escaping, before pursuing a degree with the aim of turning her personal pain into action against the men behind atrocities. Now she runs a human rights group making videos in which abuse victims tell their stories, accusing high-ranking assailants and detailing locations and dates of attacks. These are loaded on to USB sticks with information about women\u2019s rights, then smuggled into North Korea and scattered on the ground in public places.</p> <p>When we meet, Lee shows me a leopardskin makeup bag with a sly smile. Inside are several freshly smuggled North Korean mobile phones that contain pictures of people watching banned content. Already this year, her New Korea Women\u2019s Union, which also helps new arrivals settle, has sent more than 1,200 memory sticks north. \u201cWe accuse specific offenders of carrying out sexual offences,\u201d she says. \u201cThe videos tell them they will be subjected to punishment after reunification.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1168fb0a65c590f3bb2de52be3f879a8977539b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1168fb0a65c590f3bb2de52be3f879a8977539b3/0_1925_4002_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lee So-yeon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee So-yeon, head of the New Korea Women\u2019s Union, which helps female defectors settle in the South.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jun Michael Park/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of her key challenges is to explain basic human rights. \u201cThe big problem with women in North Korea is that even when they are sexually abused [or] raped or their rights are violated, they do not know these are violations. They are really emotionally damaged. Then, when defecting, they are often put through more trauma \u2013 and because they do not know these things are wrong, they suffer badly from depression.\u201d</p> <p>Lee\u2019s own story is typical. She enlisted for the army after leaving school. Famine was starting to bite: corpses littered the streets and the government stopped supplying free food to citizens. Soldiers\u2019 rations were cut in half; some resorted to stealing from villagers.</p> <p>Lee served for a decade; discharge was not an option. There was widespread sexual abuse. \u201cOne company commander had 120 female soldiers under his command and he raped 30 of them,\u201d says Lee. Was it her unit? \u201cYes,\u201d she replies. \u201cIn North Korea, there is a form of social stigma, so if a woman were to step up and say: \u2018I was sexually abused,\u2019 she would be the one blamed. And, because power was so prized, lower ranks could not step up over such matters.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Lee never doubted the system. She had seen leaflets sent from the south, but she dismissed them as psychological warfare. \u201cWe were trained all our lives to worship the Kim regime. Even when people were dying all around me, I never thought the leaders were the problem. I just wondered if I was going to die.\u201d</p> <p>After finally being discharged in 2001, she ended up selling black-market goods near the Chinese border. Buyers seeking items from abroad would ask for something \u201cfun\u201d. Listening to banned radio, watching foreign films and talking to people who had crossed the border, she began to learn about the outside world and slowly understand the scale of state duplicity. \u201cOne time I heard a radio broadcast with a defector woman talking about what her life was like in South Korea. That was when I got the desire to leave.\u201d</p> <p>Lee\u2019s first attempt at escape in 2006 ended in failure. She was caught, beaten and sent to prison for a year of re-education. Two years later, she tried again. After bribing a border guard with $500 (\u00a3380), she was successful. She spent six months in China, hiding until she could find a broker to take her to South Korea. She tells me she had bad experiences in China that she cannot bear to talk about.</p> <p>Many defectors are badly scarred by their experiences, especially the children. One teacher tells me they struggle to cope with simple things, such as seeing pupils talk back to teachers, or even seeing pizza for the first time. \u201cThe other day, we played a couple of North Korean songs and they reacted very badly. They still suffer such trauma,\u201d the teacher says.</p> <p>Yet young South Koreans show surprisingly little interest in their cause. One poll at a Seoul university found that eight out of 10 students had never met a defector, although many refugees hide their backgrounds. \u201cThe youth in South Korea today show total apathy towards their brothers and sisters in North Korea,\u201d says Cho Myung-chul, the first defector to become a South Korean MP. \u201cIf this lack of awareness and interest is not addressed, our society is doomed.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I saw a public execution aged seven, the victim's brains exploding with machine-gun fire. For us that was normal life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His government has passed a human rights act, after more than a decade of fierce debate, that will log atrocities and fund local groups. But it is a polarising issue. Two years ago, one far-left group of five MPs was disbanded by a court after accusations of pro-North activities. For many years following the famine, liberal South Korean governments pursued a \u201csunshine policy\u201d of aid and engagement with the North (technically, the two nations remain at war: when conflict ended in 1953, they merely signed a truce). The past two South Korean presidents, both on the right, have taken a tougher line, demanding an end to the North\u2019s sabre-rattling and nuclear aggression.</p> <p>South Korea sees reunification as a core policy, with a special government ministry and programmes to assist defectors. But many are sceptical about the practicalities, especially given the growing economic disparity between Asia\u2019s fourth biggest economy and its poor, isolated neighbour. \u201cWe are not going to war,\u201d says Lee Jung-hoon, South Korea\u2019s ambassador for human rights, who supports defector activism. \u201cThe change has to come from within. So, they have to hear information. They need to understand the situation outside their walls.\u201d</p> <p>The efforts of defectors to subvert a state that once controlled them seem to be having an impact. A leaked North Korean security report from September 2014 revealed that \u201cinappropriate recordings and propaganda publications\u201d were on the rise, with mobile phones proving difficult to control. Citizens were ordered to disable Bluetooth on phones to stop data transfers, and searches have been increased in schools, factories and offices. One school was singled out for praise after insisting on daily reports from all students and staff to prevent suspicious activities such as \u201cwatching and circulating illegal content\u201d.</p> <p>But these attempts to empower citizens can do only so much: the key to the disintegration of the regime can come only from China, which supports Pyongyang as a buffer against the west.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Perhaps the most haunting story of escape and defection I hear is from Hyeonseo Lee, whose gripping biography <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/girl-with-seven-names.html\">The Girl With Seven Names</a> has become a global bestseller. \u201cI saw a public execution aged seven, the victim\u2019s brains exploding from machine-gun fire,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople cannot believe how these things happen, but for us that was normal life. It didn\u2019t seem strange. Because we were brainwashed, we thought these people deserved to die.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74669592fa0389904ff316cfd93428b9913789dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74669592fa0389904ff316cfd93428b9913789dd/0_867_4002_5133/780.jpg\" alt=\"Hyeonseo Lee\" width=\"780\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018These are the most brainwashed people in the world\u2019: former soldier Hyeonseo Lee escaped at the second attempt.

She began secretly to watch Chinese television at the age of 16, hanging a blanket over her bedroom window. When her family\u2019s home burned down following an accident, her father ran back to grab their most precious possessions: portraits of Kim Jong\u2011il and Kim Il-sung. Without them, even in such circumstances, the family might have been carted off to prison \u2013 all families must display them in their homes.</p> <p>She crossed an icy river the following year to reach China and her mother sent a message telling her not to return. Lee spent years underground, during which she was kidnapped, narrowly escaped being forced into a brothel and survived police interrogation by pretending to be Chinese. Eventually, she reached South Korea \u2013 then, 11 years after she last saw her family, returned to the border on a daring, successful mission to smuggle her mother and brother across the border. Her father had died several years earlier, after falling out of favour with the regime and facing interrogation and beatings.</p> <p>I first meet her at dinner with a dozen other people. She arrives late, laughs a lot and generally lights up the room. Yet, talking alone the next day in a cake shop, Lee confesses her struggles, that she keeps busy to avoid awful memories. \u201cWhen I meet people, I forget the pain. I want to keep positive and show that North Koreans can be positive people. But when I am on my own, I think about the past and it gives me more trauma.\u201d Sometimes she cries at her computer; even sympathetic messages on social media remind her that she is a victim. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to enjoy your life,\u201d she says. \u201cKeeping busy is my escape.\u201d</p> <p>She believes it is her duty to spread the word about \u201cthis alien life\u201d. She plans to send back videos of her success as an inspiration to others. \u201cMany female defectors are successful. It can be difficult to adjust, but this is still better than staying in hell.

  "<p>I first met Sandra while door knocking for my election campaign. A year later, I bumped into her outside the local corner shop, where she was begging the shopkeeper for any food they could spare. </p> <p>She told me that she couldn\u2019t fill her fridge because her employment support allowance benefits had been stopped \u2013 she had been sanctioned by the Department for Work and Pensions because she had missed meetings when her mum died. This meant her income went down to about \u00a322 a fortnight.</p> <p>I was elected to the local council in south London a couple of years ago. But it hadn\u2019t occurred to her to come to me for help before she got into this desperate place \u2013 for her, and many of the most vulnerable residents, local councillors are a last resort or engaged because of a chance encounter like this. The very people I got into politics to help have no idea that I\u2019m here. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f51358695e1029040303b98e1427fa092a5ac618\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f51358695e1029040303b98e1427fa092a5ac618/31_0_962_577/500.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Birley at the door.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">We go door knocking regularly to encourage local residents to get in touch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: null</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She couldn\u2019t take her medication on an empty stomach and was increasingly hungry, depressed, unwell and immobile. Every sanction meant she couldn\u2019t afford the cost of the bus journey to the obligatory work programme meetings, which meant she got sanctioned again. Her letters to the department had become increasingly desperate, although her poor health and threats of suicide did nothing to change their minds that she was fit to attend. </p> <p>I work full time \u2013 my council role doesn\u2019t pay my rent and I fit my responsibilities around my day job. But I started taking an afternoon off work each time Sandra had a meeting, and would drive her there and back myself. Her first appointment filled her with such panic that she collapsed and I spent the evening with her in hospital. She used to call me at work and I would duck out of the office, terrified that something terrible had happened. I\u2019d later have to explain to my manager why I was distracted.</p> <p>And then, out of nowhere, she disappeared. Her housing association couldn\u2019t tell me anything and her neighbours hadn\u2019t seen her. Her phone was disconnected and there were no lights were on when I walked past her home. I knew she\u2019d been in despair and was convinced she had killed herself.</p> <p>In the meantime, my inbox filled with concerns about potholes, tree roots, noisy neighbours and rubbish bins. I\u2019ve started some exciting projects and supported others to run their own. As councillors, we attend regular council meetings, develop policy, campaign against local government cuts and host surgeries where we hear heartbreaking stories every week \u2013 residents who are facing eviction from private landlords, who have damp and mould in their homes, who are in limbo waiting for an immigration decision from the Home Office or who work long hours but can\u2019t afford the bills.</p> <p>When you get in touch, I want to demonstrate my value as your councillor by addressing your concerns. Sometimes the answer isn\u2019t one you\u2019re happy with \u2013 cuts to local government budgets mean we can\u2019t do everything we used to do or that we want to do. And often our systems at the council still aren\u2019t as joined up as they could be, although we\u2019re working on that. Occasionally, your emails are peppered with anger \u2013 I\u2019ve been called disconnected, disgusting, a disgrace. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/jun/11/council-homeless-unit-social-housing-assessment\">I work in a council homeless unit, where not helping people is seen as a good job</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When I saw Sandra on the bus this Sunday, alive, well and pleased to see me, I was overcome with relief. She had been away staying with her cousin while she had an operation. Having come out of the cycle of poor health and missed appointments, she hasn\u2019t been sanctioned since. </p> <p>It\u2019s frustrating to know that there are other Sandras in my borough who also aren\u2019t asking for support. Sometimes I spend so much time reacting to problems that it can be hard to find an opportunity to seek out my most vulnerable residents to ask how I can help. </p> <p>And, even more frustratingly, Sandra and others like her only need help because the system has failed. That\u2019s not right. It shouldn\u2019t be a battle for people to access help and support; they shouldn\u2019t be punished for a bereavement or for lack of a bus fare. Rather than simply navigating a broken, convoluted system with people like Sandra, I want to overhaul it completely so that it doesn\u2019t punish the vulnerable in their time of need. </p> <p>In the meantime, I\u2019m doing what I can to answer your emails, to improve the local services that I have some influence to change, to manage the huge cuts being forced on local government and to juggle a full-time job while doing my best for the local community.

  "<p>It\u2019s now nine whole weeks since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Bregsit</a>, and I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m absolutely sick to death of people talking about it. Especially people who can\u2019t pronounce it properly, such as our new prime minister, Theresa May, whose walking holiday in the Swiss mountains gave her a chance to admire stunning views of a country struggling to implement its own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/10/switzerland-talks-eu-immigration-referendum\">2014 EU referendum result</a>. Thank God we\u2019ve left the undemocratic EU and got rid of all those unelected Brussels bureaucrats who\u2019ve never done a day\u2019s work in their lives (apart from the odd shift of cardiac surgery). If we hadn\u2019t, we wouldn\u2019t now have an undemocratically appointed prime minister no one voted for.</p> <p>Anyway, enough harping on about Brexit. I\u2019m trying to focus on my garden, which takes my mind off it. My favourite plant is my potted fuchsia. Fuchsias aren\u2019t native to Britain, of course: most are from South and Central America \u2013 and very welcome they are here, too. By the way, you don\u2019t need South American soil to plant your fuchsias in. In fact, most exotic plants thrive in British conditions and contribute far more to British flora than they take, so you don\u2019t need to worry about some Syrian jasmine taking British soil away from an English plant.</p> <p>There isn\u2019t a finite amount of soil. If an English rose was waiting to be potted, for example, and a Polish corn poppy was potted first, that doesn\u2019t mean that all of the soil in Britain is now gone. It just means that one particular bit of soil has gone, but there\u2019s nothing stopping the rose from just using some other soil.</p> <p>I can see why people might think that foreign plants coming over here are a drain on our soil, but the reality is the opposite. It\u2019s a common anti-exotic plant misconception. What actually happens is that plants coming over create a demand for more soil, and for other goods and services, like plant food and pots and trellises, and more gardeners. In fact, if all the foreign plants and flowers we have here went back to where they came from, it would create a huge gap in the economy.</p> <p>In case you\u2019re wondering what Brexit is (which is entirely understandable, given that it happened nine weeks ago and is therefore no longer relevant or worthy of discussion or analysis), it\u2019s an abbreviation for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, which we voted for on 23 June, by 52 people to 48 people. Why are people still bleating on about this? Don\u2019t all the bremoaning dullards understand the democratic process? If you\u2019re not happy about getting a thing you didn\u2019t vote for, you just shut up about it and accept the thing unquestioningly. Challenging decisions you disagree with is just being a sore loser. This is why the country currently has no opposition and no hope of one any time soon.</p> <p>People really need to move on, as I told my Polish babysitter three seconds after the results came in: \u201cStop whingeing and moaning about the xenophobic and racist abuse against your community and your uncertain future, doom-monger! Your relentless negativity risks damaging the UK\u2019s economic prospects!\u201d</p> <p>We won\u2019t know the full consequences of Brexit for years, but what we do know is this: the EU referendum has exposed a nation divided in a a way we have not seen since the white-and-gold (or blue-and-black?) dress phenomenon. Relationships are under pressure, families are split, communities at odds. Nigel Farage was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2015/feb/27/the-dress-blue-black-white-gold-vision-psychology-colour-constancy\">white-and-gold or blue-and-black dress</a> of British politics. Half the nation was convinced that what it was looking at was an anti-establishment hero, a voice for change, for the working classes and the disenfranchised, a patriot, the saviour of Britain; while the other half was convinced that what it was looking at was a twat. If only Farage was an optical illusion.</p> <p>But now is not the time for petty insults and further division. We need to talk about how this happened. The 23 June vote wasn\u2019t just about EU membership; it was about inequality, class and political disillusionment. While we need to unite, we must never forget who got us here, and that means blaming the right people. It\u2019s not each other; it\u2019s the lying, scheming, reckless, narcissistic politicians who played politics with people\u2019s lives, and the British media, left and right, who let us down. It is also entirely the fault of everyone who voted to leave, and I\u2019m not going to stop bleating on about it.</p> <p>\u2022 Bridget Christie\u2019s show Because You Demanded It is at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2bqcrj6\">Leicester Square Theatre</a>, London, from 29 September.

  "<p>What happens when political language fails? When the rage and incomprehension boil over, and we run out of a common vocabulary and sufficient trust in each other\u2019s words to be able to sit down and work through what unites and divides us? Don\u2019t expect much comfort from history. From the fall of Athens to the rise of totalitarianism, observers from Thucydides to George Orwell have associated a breakdown in public language \u2013 or rhetoric, to give it a more traditional name \u2013 with the failure of democracy, loss of freedom, civil strife and, ultimately, tyranny and murder.</p> <p>We are children of the Enlightenment, brought up to believe that we must always dig below the surface to get at the truth, and that nothing could be more of the surface than rhetoric, that slap of paint politicians use to cover who knows what. No wonder we usually want to work back from deficiencies in the way we hear political ideas expressed to what we take to be more fundamental causes \u2013 ideology, group values and affinities, the major economic and social challenges of the day. But there have been periods, in both ancient and modern history, when observers have come to believe that the causality can flow in the opposite direction, and that it is when public language fails that politics as whole starts to fall apart.</p> <p>So let\u2019s talk about 2016. In Britain, the ugly shambles that passed for a once-and-for-all national debate about our place in Europe. In the US, an official candidate for the presidency seemingly capable of any exaggeration or untruth \u2013 including wondering aloud if the US\u2019s gun owners couldn\u2019t do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">something to stop Hillary</a> Clinton \u2013 but still retaining the support of tens of millions of voters. In continental Europe, the extremists gaining ground in many countries, the ultra-rightist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/norbert-hofer-austria-presidential-hopeful-rightwing\">Norbert Hofer</a> within millimetres of the Austrian presidency, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\">Marine Le Pen</a> polling well in the run-up to next year\u2019s French presidential race. And almost everywhere \u2013 whether in the debating chamber, on prime time TV or the smartphone in your pocket \u2013 a sense of a public discourse that is losing its power to explain and reconcile, or indeed to express anything beyond hatred and division.</p> <p>These trends have many social, economic and political causes, but public language \u2013 the language we use when we discuss politics or policy, or make our case in court, or try to persuade anyone of anything else in a public context \u2013 seems to me to be at the heart of the matter. Indeed, I believe we are living through what amounts to a crisis in public language.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Let\u2019s not make the mistake of\u00a0confusing anti-rhetorical \u2018truth-telling\u2019 with actually telling the truth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The crisis is playing out in many ways, but perhaps the most important is the failure of conventional political rhetoric in almost every western country. The gap between the claims and promises of political leaders and the facts on the ground \u2013 about inequality, globalisation and the crash of 2008, about immigration, about the west\u2019s unhappy wars in the Middle East, and much else besides \u2013 became insupportably wide. As opinion polls in the US, UK, France and elsewhere demonstrate, many voters have simply stopped believing a word of it.</p> <p>But the death of a political rhetoric is not like a royal succession, with the crown passing smoothly from one monarch to the next. We\u2019re living in a disputed interregnum, with many politicians refusing to accept that the old queen is dead and strange pretenders popping up everywhere \u2013 anti-politicians such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/beppe-grillo\">Beppe Grillo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, mavericks from within existing political structures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz\">Ted Cruz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris\">Boris Johnson</a> \u2013 each with their own rhetorical recipe for fame and glory.</p> <p>Of course, the pretenders would deny that they were in the rhetoric business at all. If they mention the word, it is only in the context of the detested public language of the establishment. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I can\u2019t abide it\u2019s rhetoric,\u201d that Trump-before-the-fact <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi\">Silvio Berlusconi</a> once remarked. \u201cI\u2019m only interested in what needs to get done.\u201d Trump\u2019s own appeal depends more than anything on the belief that he is a truth-teller untainted by the lying ways of conventional politicians: early in the primary campaign, one representative Fox News poll found that 44% of a sample of US voters, and 62% of Republicans, agreed with the statement: \u201cHe tells it like it is, and we need that now in a president.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46a3e01d23e1f78ad34b2e862a131f813aa363e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46a3e01d23e1f78ad34b2e862a131f813aa363e7/0_71_3108_1865/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Comedian, actor and political activist Beppe Grillo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Speaking out \u2026 comedian, actor and political activist Beppe Grillo.

One of the advantages of noisily rejecting any notion of rhetoric is that, once listeners are convinced you\u2019re not trying to deceive them in the manner of regular politicians, they may switch off the critical faculties they usually apply to political speech and forgive you any amount of exaggeration, contradiction or offensiveness. And, if rivals or the establishment media then point this out, your supporters may dismiss it as spin. Here is Florida voter Yolanda Esquivel, quoted by the BBC in November 2015, rejecting criticism of Trump for his outspokenness: \u201cI\u2019m looking at what candidates can do, not the picky little things they say that people want to make a big deal of.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Gove\u2019s statement that \u201cpeople in this country have had enough of experts\u201d was a more fine-grained attack on the conventional rhetoric of the establishment. At first blush, it sounds like \u2013 and was immediately and bitterly condemned as \u2013 an attack on expertise as such. I see it rather as an attack on the sound of modern technocratic government, a claim that the public are sick and tired of we-know-best lectures from economists and others, lectures that are couched in impenetrable jargon and that, despite their weighty tone at the time, frequently turn out to be wrong.</p> <p>The difficulty that ordinary voters have in making sense of the language of elite policymakers is a real issue. One Ipsos MORI survey identified what the researchers called a \u201cpresumption of complexity\u201d on the part of many respondents, which meant they thought it was hopeless to even try to understand the issue in question. But is Gove\u2019s proposed solution to the problem to fire the experts en masse? It seems unlikely: in the education department and elsewhere Gove was a notably technocratic minister, steeped in data and expert advice. Is it rather to hang on to the technocrats, but to hide them from public view so that their complicated ideas no longer irritate non-expert listeners? That\u2019s scarcely a recipe for restoring public confidence. Or should we see his statement as a piece of instrumental rhetoric itself, a cynical way of rubbishing the legions of pro\u2011Remain economists while simultaneously presenting the speaker himself not as a paid-up member of that hated elite, but as one of those simple souls who prefers honest ignorance to the slipperiness and insufferable superiority of the overeducated?</p> <p>Gove took care throughout the Brexit campaign to speak with more directness and less of qualification than is usual among senior British politicians. Asked on the same occasion whether he would stand to be Tory leader, he just said: \u201cCount me out.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine anything clearer or more straightforward \u2013 a refreshingly candid response from a post-rhetorical politician. Within days, that statement was no longer \u201coperative\u201d, to use the term coined by Nixon\u2019s press secretary Ron Ziegler. Clarity and straightforwardness are no guarantee that something is true.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4b5390773bb49d1548148016a8561a775ad1155\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4b5390773bb49d1548148016a8561a775ad1155/0_0_4016_2929/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration: Edward Carvalho-Monaghan for Review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"729\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration: Edward Carvalho-Monaghan for Review</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: EDWARD CARVALHO-MONAGHAN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across the west, anti-politicians from outside the mainstream, and those mainstream politicians who hope to use some of the anti-politicians\u2019 populist mojo to advance themselves and their causes within conventional political structures, are trying to strike this \u201clet\u2019s cut through the rhetoric\u201d pose. But, whether or not they and their supporters are aware of it, anti-rhetoric is itself a classic move in the rhetorical game \u2013 indeed, in the right circumstances, it can be the most persuasive move of all. And, like any other form of public language, we can unpack it to find out what makes it tick. Here\u2019s Trump addressing a stadium of supporters in Dallas in September last year:</p> <p>I made a beautiful speech. I thought it was wonderful. Everything was fine. A week and a half later, they attacked me. In other words they went through \u2013 and then they lied. They made it up. I\u2019m talking about illegal immigration \u2026 We have to stop illegal immigration. We have to do it. [Cheers and applause] We have to do it. Have to do it. [Audience: USA! USA! USA! USA!] And when I hear some of the people that I\u2019m running against, including the Democrats, we have to build a wall, folks. We have to build a wall. All you have to do is go to Israel and say, \u2018How is your wall working?\u2019 Walls work.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All rhetoric is\u00a0designed for a particular time and place, and above all for a particular audience</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Those super-short sentences emphasise certainty and determination, but build up layer by layer towards a climax with a kind of emotional logic. It\u2019s a style that students of rhetoric call parataxis. This is the way generals and dictators have always spoken to distinguish themselves from the cavilling civilians they mean to sweep aside. Julius Caesar\u2019s famous summary, not of his invasion of Britain, but of his victory in the Battle of Zela \u2013 \u201cVeni vidi vici\u201d, \u2018I came, I saw, I conquered\u2019 \u2013 is a classical example of parataxis. Today listeners are more likely to associate it with the successful entrepreneur or chief executive.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s style of parataxis is almost infinitely compressible, as his intuitive mastery of the micro-rhetorical world of Twitter shows: \u201cLightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is he is a choker, and once a choker, always a chokker [sic]! Mr Meltdown.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLightweight\u201d, \u201cchoker\u201d, \u201cMr Meltdown\u201d \u2013 this is personal in every sense of the word, and written personally on the spur of the moment or dictated in real time to a thick-fingered aide, if that last miskeyed \u201cchokker\u201d is anything to go by. But it contains no fewer than three different summaries of the Trump view of Senator Rubio, each of which is immediately and eminently retweetable. Twitter seems to have influenced Trump\u2019s set piece oratory as well; often he obsesses over a single word or a phrase, like someone feverishly circling something objectionable in a newspaper.

Nodding to a concept in quantum mechanics, the Urban Dictionary defines a \u201cSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s douchebag\u201d as someone who makes an unacceptable remark and then waits to see the reaction before declaring retrospectively whether they meant it for real or were \u201cjust joking\u201d. But perhaps in Trump\u2019s case the indeterminacy is genuine, and the words just tumble out of his mouth without him even bothering to decide at the time whether they are to be taken at face value or as a sarcastic, fantastic throwaway.</p> <p>The fluidity, the way the words follow a still-emerging train of thought, adds to the sense of spontaneity and candour. Perhaps because of that (and to the despair of many of those around him), he has so far largely refused to abandon this style of speaking in favour of prepared texts and the Teleprompter. In that Dallas speech, he starts an idea \u2013 \u201cIn other words they went through \u2026 \u201d \u2013 presumably intending to say something like, \u201cThey went through my speech and twisted what I said and presented it out of context.\u201d But this is exactly the kind of whiny complaint which conventional politicians make, so halfway through he drops it in favour of the far punchier \u201cand then they lied\u201d. Isn\u2019t lying what these political and media enemies are all about? Cut to the chase. \u201cAnd when I hear some of the people that I\u2019m running against, including the Democrats\u201d, sounds as if we\u2019re about to get a paragraph attacking other would-be Republican nominees, or the Democratic contenders, or both. But Trump doesn\u2019t want to waste time pointing out the different ways in which Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton are defective candidates. In fact he doesn\u2019t sound very interested in other candidates at all. So he simply leaves it out and jumps, mid-sentence, to the main thing on his mind: \u201cwe have to build a wall, folks\u201d.</p> <p>The immoderation is calculated. Professional politicians have traditionally wanted to be viewed as wise counsellors; mastering the detail and carefully weighing up the options before making a policy proposal; at least seeming to listen to serious objections made to them by opponents. Trump speaks as if the truth and the right policies were blindingly obvious, and the so-called wise counsellors who claim that the world is a complex place, and that policymaking needs to take account of that complexity, are idiots or in somebody\u2019s pocket. Saying the \u201cunsayable\u201d is the clearest possible way of signalling this contrary stance. But for Trump, stamping on political correctness is not just effective positioning. He has found a wanton ecstasy in it, a joyous spasm of indignation in which supporters are only too happy to lose themselves.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s douchebag makes an unacceptable remark and gauges the reaction before declaring whether they meant it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Trump style eschews any kind of rhetorical cleverness. The shocking statements are not couched in witty or allusive language. His campaign slogan \u2013 Make America Great Again! \u2013 could hardly be less original or artful. Everything is intended to emphasise the break with the despised language of the men and women of the Washington machine. There is a wall between them and you, Trump seems to say to his audience, but I am on this side of the wall alongside you. They treat you as stupid, but you understand things far better than they do. The guarantee that I see the world as you do is the fact that I speak in your language, not theirs.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">British EU referendum</a> campaign lacked the mad fireworks of the current US presidential cycle, but it too rapidly descended into wild exaggeration and insult, with the public looking on in palpable bewilderment. \u201cWhat we really need is an end to the arms race of ever more lurid claims and counter-claims made by both sides on this,\u201d was the weary verdict of Treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie MP in the days before the vote. \u201cI think it\u2019s confusing the public, it\u2019s impoverishing political debate.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/25/donald-trump-news-hillary-clinton-campaign-live-coverage\">Trump's campaign CEO once charged with domestic violence, reports say \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet clear rhetorical winners and losers still emerged. The Remain camp never found an emotionally compelling way of expressing the case for continued membership of the EU; there was no idealism nor even \u2013 at least from the most prominent leaders of the campaign \u2013 evidence of an iota of enthusiasm to put alongside the 10 plagues of Egypt with which they sought to scare off anyone contemplating departure. The Brexit messaging was both more chaotic and more irresponsible \u2013 Nigel Farage beaming in front of a poster depicting a sea of refugees worthy of Josef Goebbels himself, promises made during the campaign cheerfully revoked within hours of the votes coming in \u2013 yet the Leavers also found language with a power and cogency that eluded their adversaries. Take back control. Independence Day. Both these phrases offer the listener agency and at least the prospect of opportunity and hope. Dismissed as absurd, not just by the opposing politicians but by much of Britain, they nonetheless pushed Brexit over the top.</p> <p>Perhaps you find this kind of phrase-making glib and repellent and are amazed that anyone could be taken in by it. Perhaps you regard the success of Trump\u2019s novel style of oratory as nothing more than final confirmation that many Americans have lost their wits. Yet all rhetoric is designed for a particular time and place, and above all for a particular audience \u2013 it is a supremely tactical, contextual art \u2013 and these words probably weren\u2019t intended for you. And you must accept that by the same token the public language that most persuades you, whether it\u2019s the fierce rhetoric of rights and inclusion or the measured rationality of evidence-based policymaking, and whether delivered with the soaring inspiration of the young Obama, the dogged persistence of a Bernie Sanders or a Jeremy Corbyn, or the authoritative and affectless calm of an Angela Merkel or a Theresa May, can ring every bit as hollow in other ears.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b876b6534b1b1daf900917a6d6c51cc34651bbd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b876b6534b1b1daf900917a6d6c51cc34651bbd4/0_0_2902_1743/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukip leader Nigel Farage poses in front of a poster depicting refugees during the EU referendum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ukip leader Nigel Farage poses in front of a poster depicting refugees during the EU referendum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So how did we get here \u2013 and what, if anything, can we do to begin to put things right? I\u2019m sceptical of any theory that is predicated on the wickedness or insanity of any one set of actors in this drama. It\u2019s easy to blame politicians and parties with whom you happen to disagree, but this doesn\u2019t account for the fact that similar changes are taking place in public discourse in radically different political cultures and across ideological polarities: the mainly leftwing critics of Andrew Lansley\u2019s attempt to reform the NHS under a Tory-led coalition in this country used some of the same rhetorical tactics as the conservative opponents of Obamacare in the US. For me, the loading of all blame on to the political other is not a diagnosis but a symptom of the disease. Nor do I believe, as Tony Blair suggested in his 2007 \u201cFeral Beast\u201d speech, that the principal culprits are the media. That is also too simplistic \u2013 not that I think that my profession is entirely blameless.</p> <p>I believe instead that the crisis in our public language springs from a set of interlocking political, cultural and technological forces \u2013 forces that go beyond any one ideology, or interest group, or national political situation. The first factor is the changing character of western politics, with previous affiliations based on class and other forms of traditional group identity giving way, especially after the end of the cold war, to a more complex and uncertain landscape in which political leaders struggle for definition and differentiation. With policy platforms more arguable and coalitions of interest more transient, it\u2019s hardly surprising that political rhetoric has become more fissiparous and \u2013 because, when tribal loyalties recede, the character of individual politicians becomes more salient \u2013 more personal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The internet has opened a Pandora\u2019s box of extremism and fury, and the vitriol spills back into real-world politics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The second factor is that widening gulf between the worldview and language of the experts who make modern policy and those of the public at large. Modern government is inescapably technocratic and \u2013 precisely because western societies have already made gigantic gains in many areas \u2013 the trade-offs involved in any new policy proposal are more finely balanced than they used to be: it was far easier to decide in the aftermath of the second world war that London needed a major new airport than it is to decide today whether that airport should have an additional runway. The ranks of economists, statisticians and planners assemble vast quantities of evidence to support the political decision-making process, but neither they nor ministers seem to believe it is feasible, or perhaps even desirable, to try to share much of this with the public. As a result, there are often two quite distinct discourses about a given policy question: a sophisticated, evidence-based conversation between the illuminati who sit behind the closed doors of Whitehall, the European Commission and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/imf\">IMF</a>; and an instinct-based and often emotional wrangle in the realm of retail politics. One way of thinking about the Brexit debate is as a clash between these two modes of political discourse, with that of the professional policymakers coming off a poor second.</p> <p>The next factor is digital technology and its impact both on pre-existing media and on the wider dissemination and discussion of political ideas. Over three decades or so, technology has driven an astonishing expansion of media choice and it has democratised the generation and dissemination of political opinion. It has also disrupted legacy business models, squeezed investment in newsrooms and in specialist journalistic expertise, and left most news publishers, whether venerable analogue-era institutions or digital startups, edging towards economic survival mode \u2013 chasing audiences, optimising headlines, courting shock and controversy. Apart from a handful of players, seriousness, restraint and a sense that journalists have a duty to make major public policy choices intelligible to the public have all been in retreat.</p> <p>The web and the major social platforms have also allowed anyone who wants to take part in a new 24/7 worldwide discussion of politics, culture and pretty much everything else. Alas, alongside much that is thoughtful and constructive, the new technologies have opened a Pandora\u2019s box of (often anonymous) abuse, extremism, intimidation and fury. And the vitriol spills back into conventional media and real-world politics \u2013 I saw it myself in July at the Republican convention in Cleveland (\u201cLock her up! Lock her up!\u201d was the least of it). The internet has set a new dark standard for the expression of strong opinion, which some politicians, activists and commentators are only too happy to meet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/21/death-of-neoliberalism-crisis-in-western-politics\">Neoliberalism has had its day. So what happens next? | Martin Jacques</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fourth force at work is related to our understanding of how persuasive language works. Over the course of the 20th century, empirical advances were made in the way words are used to sell to goods and services. They were then systematically applied to political messaging, and the impressionistic rhetoric of promotion increasingly came to replace the rhetoric of traditional step-by-step political argument. The effect has been to give political language some of the brevity, intensity and urgency we associate with the best marketing, but to strip it of explanatory and argumentative power.</p> <p>What can we do? The forces at work are formidable and tend to reinforce each other. We are adaptable creatures and we know that our life together depends on our being able to resolve our differences at least most of the time, so it\u2019s reasonable to hope that one day this difficult and disruptive period of political, social and technological transition will yield to a new equilibrium and a recovery of the public language on which the health of our democracies depends. We can\u2019t know for sure if or when that will happen, but there are some steps we could take right away.</p> <p>Politicians could treat the public like grownups and share some of their actual thinking about policy, including those painful trade-offs, with the people they want to vote for them. Reciprocal altruism might even lead them to shout less and allow their opponents to finish the sentence more often so that those same opponents extend the same courtesy to them. The media too could cut fewer corners and take more chances with the journalism that costs more \u2013 international reporting, investigations \u2013 but may ultimately make for a better business. Without in any way going soft, it could allow politicians more space to address the public in their own words. As for the public themselves? Let\u2019s teach our children rhetoric. Teach them how words and images are used, and abused, to sell packaged goods, political parties and wars, holy or otherwise.</p> <p>Of course, any programme of reform has to begin with an acknowledgement that there is a problem. If this weird and unsettling year has nothing else to teach us, we can still hope that 2016 will go down as the moment we took that crucial first step.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Thompson is CEO of the New York Times and former director general of the BBC.

Add the chopped onion, the garlic and cumin. Add salt, to taste and a pinch of sugar if the tomatoes need sweetening or the bitterness of the chillies needs toning down.

  "<p>Australian children who were not white and middle class were all but invisible in children\u2019s books, the author Maxine Beneba Clarke said in her keynote address at the opening of the Melbourne writers festival on Friday night.</p> <p>Clarke, 36, is from an Afro-Caribbean background. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-books-blog/2016/aug/10/the-accumulative-effects-of-racism-it-eats-away-at-the-essence-of-your-being\">Her writing, including her recent memoir, The Hate Race</a>, has been praised for its passion and originality about issues of casual racism in Australia.</p> <p>She told the audience that children in wheelchairs, or those who wore headscarves, or who were being raised by single or same-sex parents, or who lived in public housing or had brown skin, rarely saw themselves in books. It had a profound impact on their sense of themselves and their place in Australia, and she urged publishers to take more risks when considering children\u2019s books.</p> <p>\u201cBooks render them invisible, that their stories are not important,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the right of every child to see themselves in story.\u201d</p> <p>In an address that began with a poetry performance piece about race and children, Clarke said she was 19 before she read a novel with a central character who looked like her, and it was a revelation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-books-blog/2016/aug/10/the-accumulative-effects-of-racism-it-eats-away-at-the-essence-of-your-being\">The accumulative effects of racism: it eats away at the essence of your being</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It followed a Sydney childhood in which she and her sister worried at every school Book Week about dressing up as a character from literature.

Government chastises the voting public for enjoying now unaffordable benefits and for failing to comprehend the problem and for not backing the government\u2019s policies to fix it.</p> <p>5.

We all know some of the savings about to be presented have been rejected by the electorate as inequitable and will almost certainly continue to be. We all know there are alternatives and compromises to be had, with broad support, if this was really just about finding solutions. <a href=\"http://www.acoss.org.au/media_release/summit-makes-for-diverse-allies-to-reform-economy/\">Business and civil society have already had summits to pave the way.</a> Think tanks have written reports. We\u2019ve been talking about it for years.</p> <p>There\u2019s every sign the voting public is prepared to consider alternatives and would almost certainly reward a government that tried to tackle budget \u201crepair\u201d in a cooperative or bipartisan way. There was no great voter backlash against the winding back of negative gearing proposed by Labor, for example, despite the Coalition\u2019s best efforts, nor a groundswell of opposition against reduced superannuation tax breaks. That was more a problem in the Liberal\u2019s own branches.</p> <p>There was certainly plenty of self-serving political tactics in Bill Shorten\u2019s National Press Club offer of a superannuation compromise last week, but as Liberal backbencher Russell Broadbent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/liberal-mp-criticises-scott-morrison-should-reach-out-to-labor-on-superannuation\">was brave enough to say to my colleague Katharine Murphy</a>, there were also a lot of good reasons for the Coalition to consider it. Morrison, battling internal dissent on the issue, ruled it out immediately, preferring the simplistic rhetorical binary of spending cuts versus higher taxes, to the possibility of an outcome.</p> <p>So the policy debate continues to do donuts. Lots of screeching about looming trillion dollar deficits. Lots of blowing smoke. Little progress. And budget repair isn\u2019t the only policy going around in circles.</p> <p>Again it\u2019s possibly pre-positioning, or expectations management, but the new environment minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/28/josh-frydenberg-australias-use-of-coal-is-falling-and-that-is-not-a-bad-thing\">Josh Frydenberg\u2019s first pronouncement in his new portfolio </a>was that there would be no substantive changes to Direct Action. Once again, we\u2019ve been through this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/27/election-2016-greg-hunt-coalition-emissions-trading-scheme\">so very many times</a> before. Without substantive changes the policy cannot meet Australia\u2019s promised emission reduction targets. Insisting that it can, over and over, does not change this fact. Not even if you change the minister. Labor\u2019s 2016 election policy held out the prospect of a bipartisan compromise, based on the Direct Action model. It\u2019s just unclear whether there can be a sufficiently long cease fire in the climate wars for the government to take it. </p> <p>Similarly the terrible dilemma posed by offshore detention of asylum seekers requires the government and the opposition to be slightly flexible with solutions.</p> <p>These political stand-offs are major practical problems in themselves, but they also have a broader impact on the system as voters tune out of \u201cdebates\u201d that have no obvious conclusion. Who can blame them?</p> <p>There\u2019s been much written about the low primary votes for both major parties in 2016 and the fact that nearly a quarter of the electorate opted for minor parties or independents \u2013 the populist offerings of some of those parties, the economic anxieties in parts of the electorate. </p> <p>Even before the election a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/now-for-the-big-question-who-do-you-trust-to-run-the-country-58723\">survey</a> by the the <a href=\"http://moadoph.gov.au/\">Museum of Australian Democracy</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.governanceinstitute.edu.au/\">institute for governance and policy analysis</a> at the University of Canberra showed levels of trust in government and politicians were at their lowest levels since 1993 and that 74% of the electorate thought people in government would look after their own political interests, rather than do the right thing.</p> <p>Perhaps the election result was also a simple reaction to the inability of the parliament to get things done, to enunciate a problem and then make the compromises necessary to get on and fix it. To do its job. To find the \u201csensible centre\u201d instead of just talking about it. Reciting the same economic arguments with slightly reworked catchphrases will probably mean the policies hit the same walls as last time. That would only exacerbate the disillusionment spiral.</p>"
