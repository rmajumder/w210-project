  "<p>Labor is preparing to launch a proposal to invite all federal parliamentarians to sign up to a code of race ethics, echoing an initiative advanced by the ALP and the Australian Democrats during the period Pauline Hanson was last in parliament.</p> <p>The code is yet to clear Labor\u2019s caucus processes, but the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has told Guardian Australia it would be an important gesture for the 45th parliament. \u201cIt would send a message about what sort of parliament we want to be,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/we-cant-eradicate-racism-but-telling-its-targets-to-grin-and-bear-it-isnt-good-enough\">We can't eradicate racism but telling its targets to grin and bear it isn't good enough | Tim Soutphommasane</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The previous code of race ethics was pursued by the then Labor senator Margaret Reynolds and the Democrat senator John Woodley in 1996, prompted by concern about the debate about racism that erupted in that year\u2019s election campaign.</p> <p>The code required parliamentarians to sign on to a set of principles, including respect for religious and cultural diversity, supporting tolerance and justice within a multicultural society, and \u201cto speak and write in a manner which provides factual commentary on a foundation of truth about all issues being debated in the community and the parliament\u201d.</p> <p>Dreyfus indicated that the wording for Labor\u2019s proposal would be similar to the Reynolds/Woodley initiative, which won support from 54% of parliamentarians. He said assuming that the proposal cleared Labor\u2019s internal deliberations, he would invite all parliamentarians to sign on.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s move follows Hanson\u2019s declaration in her first speech in the Senate that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/14/pauline-hanson-first-speech-senate-calls-for-immigration-ban\">Australia was in danger of being \u201cswamped\u201d by Muslims</a>. It comes as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/21/race-discrimination-commissioner-criticises-pauline-hanson-for-stoking-division\">new polling suggests 49% of Australians support One Nation\u2019s call for a ban on Muslim immigration</a>.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, used a speech at the Australian National University this week to warn about the dangers of politicians fanning xenophobic sentiment.</p> <p>In an interview with Guardian Australia\u2019s Australian politics live podcast, he warned the country was approaching a tipping point in race relations. \u201cMake no mistake, we are in a time when our values and our harmony are being tested, and we need to rise to this test and ensure we live up to the best of our traditions as a nation of immigration,\u201d Soutphommasane said.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the political rhetoric we are hearing at the moment is taking us down a very different path.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a real danger that we are normalising what might otherwise be unacceptable ideas</p> <footer> <cite>Tim Soutphommasane</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He said people declaring in the parliament that Muslims weren\u2019t welcome, or people arguing for a watering down of protections in the Racial Discrimination Act, needed to focus on the consequences of their statements, rather than think they were engaged in an abstract philosophical debate.</p> <p>\u201cIf people are worried about Muslim immigrants integrating into Australian society they should remember that telling Muslims they are not welcome is going to do nothing to aid migrants of a Muslim background becoming acquainted with Australian culture, or feeling that they belong to our society \u2013 and that\u2019s the best way to integrate migrants, to ensure they receive a fair go, and they get the time they need for them and their families to settle in and contribute to our country,\u201d Soutphommasane said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a largely cohesive, harmonious and stable society, so to see these explosions of anxiety is concerning. I wouldn\u2019t want to see it deteriorate.</p> <p>\u201cAnd here we need to think about the effect it\u2019s going to have on our daily lives. When you see or hear hostility being vented against Muslims in our political debate that\u2019s going to affect how the young Muslim schoolboy or schoolgirl is going to experience life in the schoolyard. Having that kind of exclusion is no recipe for societal cohesion.\u201d</p> <p>The race discrimination commissioner said people who want to remove the words offend and insult from the Racial Discrimination Act often failed to point out that the legislation was not some broad-ranging prohibition, but a specific form of protection. The commissioner said section 18C of the act was about nipping racial hatred in the bud, and preventing it escalating into actual violence.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe Racial Discrimination Act covers acts which offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate on the basis of race,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very different thing to offending or insulting on the basis of the football team you support.</p> <p>\u201cPogroms have never been organised, as far as I know, on the basis of the football teams you support. But pogroms have been organised against people on the basis of race and their background.\u201d</p> <p>He also responded to the Essential poll that found 49% support for banning Muslim immigration. \u201cI was surprised and very concerned \u2026 because we\u2019ve had a non-discriminatory immigration policy for many years.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/01/the-debate-about-18c-doesnt-have-to-be-a-left-right-slanging-match\">The debate about 18C doesn't have to be a left-right slanging match | Gay Alcorn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said the poll was out of sync with other field evidence which confirmed there was broad-ranging community support for a non-discriminatory immigration policy.</p> <p>\u201cThe numbers may reflect where the debate is at the moment. We have seen about two months of blanket coverage of Ms Hanson, not a week goes by when you don\u2019t see or hear her views about immigration and Islam, and there\u2019s a real danger that we are normalising what might otherwise be unacceptable ideas, beyond the bounds of a liberal democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Again, Soutphommasane urged people to focus on the practical consequences flowing from their statements.</p> <p>\u201cConsider what the full implications of discriminating on the basis of religion will mean. If this is carried out, our immigration officials at our airports and ports are going to have to make calls about who is going to pass and who isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSound familiar? Well this is what we did during the white Australia policy.\u201d<br></p>",

She lashed out at how Russia had, over the past five years, consistently propped up the Assad regime and protected it from any consequences of its murderous policies. At length, she described Bashar al-Assad\u2019s strategy of \u201cdeath by a thousand paper cuts\u201d: starvation sieges; the \u201chorrifying, predictable regularity\u201d of strikes on civilian targets; the \u201croutine\u201d use of chemical weapons; and \u201ctorture chambers\u201d holding \u201ctens of thousands of people\u201d. Why, she asked, had Russia never once called an urgent security council meeting over such horrors?</p> <p>There have long been two takes on Syria. One is the geopolitical realism line, which Barack Obama has chosen to follow&#xa0;largely because it fits with his reluctance&#xa0;to get involved in another war. The line is that US or western security interests are not at stake in an intractable, far-flung civil war that can more easily be contained than solved. The other is the moral imperative line that Power has repeatedly advocated within the administration. It refers to the doctrine of \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d, according to which a state\u2019s sovereignty can be violated when a regime slaughters its own citizens.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/sep/20/syria-aftermath-of-airstrike-on-un-aid-convoy-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53z9j\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2734012\"            data-video-name=\"Aftermath of airstrike on Syrian aid convoy \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e0d43de4b051672d9f7ff2\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/21/160921syriaupdate4_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/21/160921syriaupdate4.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/21/160921syriaupdate4_V10.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/sep/20/syria-aftermath-of-airstrike-on-un-aid-convoy-video\">Aftermath of airstrike on Syrian aid convoy \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Power published a book in 2002, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/jun/29/highereducation.news\" title=\"\">A Problem from Hell</a>, describing how US governments had historically failed to prevent genocides and mass atrocities \u2013 the book reportedly drew Obama\u2019s attention to her when he was a senator.</p> <p>The differences between Power and Obama were apparent in her stinging UN statement. By contrast, Obama said little on Syria in his UN speech this week.</p> <p>In his 2009 <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-acceptance-nobel-peace-prize\" title=\"\">Nobel prize speech</a>, Obama said that inaction in the face of mass slaughter \u201ctears at our conscience and can lead to most costly intervention later\u201d. As Syria turned into hell on earth, the president repeatedly made the case that any intervention would be either futile or dangerous.</p> <p>In tune with the American public\u2019s aversion to military involvement after&#xa0;the disastrous Bush years, his policies have ranged from attempts to negotiate Assad\u2019s physical departure from Syria (a plan dubbed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/30/syria-horror-western-inaction-obama-priority\" title=\"\">Yemeni scenario</a> in 2012) to creating a \u201chub\u201d in Turkey where rebels would be armed and trained (but without anti-tank or anti-aircraft weaponry), and \u2013 once Russia\u2019s military intervention was launched in 2015 \u2013 more intense diplomacy with Moscow.</p> <p>Results have been scant. What seems to have been missing from the US calculus, and what Power\u2019s comments have perhaps unwillingly underscored, is that so many signs point to a crude reality: that Assad and his backer, Vladimir Putin, aren\u2019t just indifferent to crimes against humanity but believe they serve their purpose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee2d8843b67ca4e8620d3c3aae3deb42e5c68a50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee2d8843b67ca4e8620d3c3aae3deb42e5c68a50/0_125_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US ambassador Samantha Powers with secretary of state John Kerry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US ambassador Samantha Powers with secretary of state John Kerry at the security council at the UN in New York on 21 September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Assad warned back in 2011 that he would spread chaos throughout Syria and beyond if calls for him to step down weren\u2019t retracted. Putin has constructed his whole domestic political narrative around the notion that, however much he may be criticised by the west, he has restored Russia\u2019s strength. Nor is Putin much bothered by the crimes of the Assad regime \u2013 his own army carried out similar massacres in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/putins-closest-ally-and-his-biggest-liability\" title=\"\">Chechnya</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible Power\u2019s statement was aimed at western public opinion rather than at the autocrats who, time and again, have demonstrated their capacity to order or tolerate untold levels of violence against civilians.</p> <p>As his presidency comes to a close, the fact is that Obama has little to show&#xa0;the world on Syria. With an estimated half a million deaths, the Middle East in flames and European allies destabilised by the impact of refugee flows, he will pass on a festering crisis to his successor.</p> <p>Russia was always going to be a stumbling block, not least because Putin long ago identified Obama\u2019s reluctance to do more \u2013 such as arming the rebels decisively, upholding his self-proclaimed \u201cred line\u201d or setting up a no-fly zone (before Russian intervention made that impossible). There is a long list of missed opportunities that might have forced Assad to the negotiating table.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/22/overnight-airstrikes-rebel-held-aleppo-kill-syrians\">Syria conflict: overnight airstrikes on rebel-held Aleppo kill dozens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Earlier this year the Atlantic magazine &#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/03/obama-doctrine-quotes-foreign-policy/424281/\" title=\"\">quoted Obama</a> saying of Putin: \u201cThe notion that somehow Russia&#xa0;is in a stronger position now than&#xa0;before he had to deploy military forces to Syria is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of power in foreign affairs.\u201d Yet today Putin does appear stronger, if only because the US finds itself scrambling to salvage the ceasefire deal without any leverage. Trying to blame and shame Russia over the UN convoy bombing is unlikely to achieve much on its own.</p> <p>A key problem with the ceasefire deal was the plan to set up a US-Russia \u201cjoint implementation centre\u201d to coordinate strikes against Islamic State. This was meant as an incentive, as Putin had long sought&#xa0;to be accepted as a coalition partner alongside the United States. But if implemented, such a coalition could make the US complicit in Russian airstrikes, which have been designed to strengthen Assad. The US would endorse a Russian intervention premised on the notion that there are only two actors in Syria: Assad and the jihadis.</p> <p>Yet as Power pointed out, \u201cthe Syrian government, which bills itself as a fighter against terrorists, allows Isis to grow and grow and grow \u2026 Assad\u2019s antics \u2013 his tactics, his strategy \u2013 have been a gift to terrorists in Syria and well beyond\u201d.</p> <p>By siding with Russia, the US would risk offering another gift to terrorists. Of course, American policymakers were well aware of this, which is why they set&#xa0;preconditions: a partial freezing of the civil war, and safe passage for humanitarian aid deliveries to Aleppo, the armed opposition\u2019s last stronghold. But appealing to Putin\u2019s sense of decency to get Assad to curtail his bombing was always going to be a gamble. Why would Putin seek to please the US once he had become an equal player alongside the sole global power?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/22/overnight-airstrikes-rebel-held-aleppo-kill-syrians\">UN seeks to resume aid convoys to Syria after airstrikes on Aleppo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Obama has been in a hurry to reach a breakthrough on Syria these past few months, because he\u2019s leaving office. Putin certainly isn\u2019t. Nor is he constrained by domestic public opinion to do the right thing, or even try to.</p> <p>The Obama administration is hanging&#xa0;on to the last shreds of its ceasefire plan \u2013 for lack of an alternative, though its critics would do well to avoid&#xa0;schadenfreude. With Isis-connected terrorism spreading in many parts of the world and illiberalism growing in Europe on the back of the refugee crisis, Syria has become a security threat well beyond the Middle&#xa0;East. Against that backdrop, geopolitical realism and moral imperatives look less like opposites.</p> <p>Assad is capitalising on the balance of forces Russia has helped create. This in turn \u2013 as Power has said \u2013 will fuel Isis, whose twisted claim is to be the champion of Sunni Muslims. This means more problems lie ahead for the west, and more suffering for the Syrians.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Putin is celebrated by populists around the world for having outmanoeuvred the US by pulling himself up to the ranks of a leader whose cooperation is almost begged for. Russia may be in recession, and its economy the size of Australia\u2019s, but in Syria it has been given a free hand. Whatever one may think of American power and its limits, and however one may choose to gauge Syria\u2019s importance to narrowly defined US national security interests, history will remember that this all happened under Obama\u2019s watch.</p> <p>A former adviser to Bill Clinton once reflected on how the US had failed to prevent massacres in Bosnia: he said that by 1995, \u201cthe issue had become a cancer on our foreign policy and on his administration\u2019s leadership\u201d. For this reason, Clinton in the end ordered targeted strikes on Serbian forces, which forced Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to the negotiating table. Power, who covered that crisis as a journalist, eloquently told&#xa0;the story in her book.</p> <p>No doubt Syria is a complex, multifaceted war, on a different scale to Bosnia. But the lesson that should still be drawn is that war diplomacy can only succeed if leverage is decisively built up, not just hoped for. If talking to Russia is the only gateway to a peace process in Syria, more than simple persuasion must be brought to bear on it.</p>",

By contrast to Peter Blake\u2019s vivid artwork for the Beatles\u2019 previous album, Sgt Pepper\u2019s, it was a plain white sleeve with the band name just embossed, almost invisible. There was a stamped number, which made each one unique. My parents had it first, but I thought it looked boring until I studied art. Once you understand the context, it gets really interesting. We think of design as for the present moment, but while music doesn\u2019t change, people\u2019s feelings and relations to it do. So the sleeve becomes a reflection of that. It placed an avant-garde idea into the mainstream \u2013 the cover is a blank space on which you can project your fantasies. A few years ago, this guy had a record shop selling nothing but old copies of the White Album. People had drawn on them, made coffee cup rings on them or whatever and each one was different, because it had lived a life. On <a href=\"http://store.davidbowie.com/blackstar-vinyl-lp.html\">the vinyl edition of Blackstar</a>, you can see the record and, over time, watch it decay.

The future seemed right around the corner. At the same time, there was this incredible psychedelic movement going on. It felt as if everything could be different. The musicians were making new worlds. I was obsessed with designing the future, but the graphic designers of the day were hardwiring it into our existing culture with their decades-old design and fonts. That\u2019s why <a href=\"http://www.myraltis.co.uk/rickgriffin/\">Rick Griffin</a>\u2019s cover had such a powerful effect on me, and is still my favourite sleeve. He had changed the use of lettering completely but it was still legible. The painting looks as if it comes from a completely other world. It seemed to be saying to me that the rules were bullshit, that we could do anything we wanted. As an art student, this was like being given the keys to a prison door. I didn\u2019t copy it, but it allowed me to do my own thing. The album is OK, but the cover is blisteringly amazing. When I look at it, I see freedom.</p> <h2>Kraftwerk \u2013 Autobahn (1974)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef5bc5a36630f901879e34b5aeae19611648665c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef5bc5a36630f901879e34b5aeae19611648665c/89_74_2543_2542/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kraftwerk \u2013 Autobahn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Peter Saville</em></strong><em>, famed for his work with New Order, Joy Division and Factory Records</em></p> <p>Autobahn was the first album I ever bought, after I heard the single on the radio. In 1974, as a teenager who had never been abroad, listening to the full 22-minute title track while staring at the autobahn symbol on the sleeve felt like being taken on a journey. I was on a European highway, in a soundscape crafted by classically trained musicians, seeing cathedrals and power stations, villages and skyscrapers, ancient and modern, in time as well as distance. It was a continental tour \u2013 from gothic to postmodern, from the dark ages to Brigitte Bardot \u2013 with the pulsebeat of a speeding vehicle. All defined in a simple symbol. As a fledgling visual artist, this was my first lesson in semiotics. I realised that visual codes acted as keys to unlock the huge range of potential awareness in an audience. Four years later, when I was asked to do <a href=\"http://www.2welve.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/the-factory-poster.jpg\">the poster for the first night of the Factory club</a>, I noticed an industrial warning sign on a workshop door at art college: \u201cUse hearing protection.\u201d I\u2019d been thinking \u201cFactory ... new music ... industrial city\u201d and realised: \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d My Autobahn moment.</p> <h2>Hawkwind \u2013 In Search of Space (1971)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06f27c06b78ab430e57d5e6eb41c21f608288624\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06f27c06b78ab430e57d5e6eb41c21f608288624/10_0_1479_1479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hawkwind \u2013 In Search of Space.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Malcolm Garrett</em></strong><em> AKA Assorted Images, designer of classic artwork for Buzzcocks, Magazine, Duran Duran and Simple Minds</em></p> <p>At my grammar school, you displayed your allegiances via the album you carried under your arm: Deep Purple in Rock, Genesis\u2019s Nursery Cryme and so on. The longhairs were outsiders, but to be ever more apart, you carried Hawkwind. The designer, <a href=\"http://www.johncoulthart.com/feuilleton/2007/01/20/barney-bubbles-artist-and-designer/\">Barney Bubbles</a>, was a genius. This wasn\u2019t just a square of card. It <a href=\"https://pathwaygroupstoke.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/hawkwindisoslog2.jpg\">unfolded out to a rough hawk shape</a>. On the front, there was this post-psychedelic, pre-electro, sci-fi mandala. On the back, there were no track titles, just a completely blurred picture of them playing live (which seemed to replicate the Hawkwind live experience) and the words: \u201cTechnicians of spaceship Earth, this is your captain speaking, your captain is dead.\u201d Coming with a booklet of countercultural images and texts, it really broke convention for album packaging. It inspired me graphically, with its geometric shapes and fluorescent colours, and I became immersed in an \u201calternative\u201d lifestyle and took psychedelic drugs. On one trip in Scotland, I was convinced I could see aliens landing, I experienced synaesthesia and distinctly remember listening to this album through my teeth. When the Sex Pistols came along, I realised this outsider attitude applied equally to another counterculture, punk.</p> <h2>Iggy Pop \u2013 Lust for Life (1977)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e301930510af6afc0a46e73c904d891ec3495d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e301930510af6afc0a46e73c904d891ec3495d3/101_134_2375_2375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iggy Pop \u2013 Lust For Life.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Vaughan Oliver</em></strong><em>, who defined the visual aesthetic of the </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/10/4ad-label-behind-pixies-cocteau-twins\"><em>4AD label in the 80s</em></a></p> <p>I wanted to design record sleeves from the moment I went to see a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2015/oct/21/roger-dean-somewhere-near-here-prog-rock-album-covers-in-pictures\">Roger Dean</a> lecture in Durham when I was 15. His sleeves weren\u2019t about how the band looked, but the use of imagination. In my work, I\u2019m keen on the ambiguous and the mysterious. This sleeve is the complete antithesis of my philosophy, but I like its innocence and directness. I\u2019m not a fan of the graphics, but this image \u2013 given what Iggy was going through in 1977 with heroin addiction \u2013 is just extraordinary. Andy Kent\u2019s photograph isn\u2019t the depiction of a wasted rock\u2019n\u2019roller one might expect. Iggy\u2019s a beautiful man, aged 30, but it\u2019s like a high-school photograph and totally fits the words Lust for Life. I bought it when I was at Newcastle Polytechnic, probably because of David Bowie\u2019s involvement. The sleeve seemed confrontational and unexpected. Iggy looks like a children\u2019s TV presenter or someone about to present the weather forecast, but the record inside is raw and harrowing. It\u2019s the absolute opposite of everything conjured up by the sleeve. I love that.</p> <h2>Pixies \u2013 Doolittle (1989)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f891db45b3249b2c50dd470752d44f15500cdd36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f891db45b3249b2c50dd470752d44f15500cdd36/181_310_2378_2378/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pixies \u2013 Doolittle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Tash Willcocks</em></strong><em>, Manchester-based illustrator behind sleeves such as </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/may/04/shopping.culture\"><em>Elbow\u2019s Asleep in the Back</em></a></p> <p>I was brought up in a house in Cornwall where no one listened to music. When I was a teenager, my friends bought this album and showed me it. In 1989, I had never seen anything like it. The combination of Simon Larbalestier\u2019s photography and <a href=\"http://www.hardformat.org/designers/vaughan-oliver-designer/\">Vaughan Oliver</a>\u2019s design and typography was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I thought: \u201cWhatever that is, that\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d I had always been a messy person, but suddenly everything made sense. I realised that in art and design, you can get your hands dirty, make mistakes and embrace them. Before this, to me, a record cover meant a boyband on a sleeve, which made me want to puke, but here was something I could emotionally engage with. It gave me no answers, only a million questions. Why are the letters like this? Why is the print over the top of everything? I can\u2019t even remember playing it, just staring at it and it taking over my brain. It gave me permission to be me, which has influenced everything in my life.</p> <h2>Rammellzee Vs K-Rob \u2013 Beat Bop (1983)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3ecbae19190182e92a238979e33f8c25dd83b82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3ecbae19190182e92a238979e33f8c25dd83b82/0_0_1589_1600/993.jpg\" alt=\"Rammellzee versus K-Rob - Beat Bop.\" width=\"993\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Tony Hung</em></strong><em>, artist behind Blur\u2019s The Magic Whip </em></p> <p><a href=\"http://basquiat.com/\">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a>\u2019s artwork brought this great hip-hop 12in from 1983 to my attention in a record shop in Manchester. The cover is typically Basquiat. In the context of a record sleeve, he brings something unconventional, bold, playful, thought-provoking, raw and engaging while maintaining an unlaboured feel. All the surfaces \u2013 including the record labels \u2013 are something to behold, and perfectly suit the music within. Despite being 33 years old, this work feels more potent than ever, when much of our daily eyeline is bombarded with overstylised, computer-perfected, market-led noise. Armed with just a paint stick, Basquiat effortlessly cuts through it all. It\u2019s life-affirming. It reminds me I am a human being and to be a human being, to be instinctive, and that with just primitive tools, we can still make joyful and fulfilling work.</p> <h2>Joy Division \u2013 Unknown Pleasures (1979)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f179418bc7b556a3b081289f04e484c324f8cbd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f179418bc7b556a3b081289f04e484c324f8cbd1/0_0_1448_1449/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joy Division \u2013 Unknown Pleasures.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Dan Hillier</em></strong><em>, winner of the 2014 Best Art Vinyl award for the cover of Royal Blood\u2019s debut album</em></p> <p>I was five or six when this came out in 1979, and didn\u2019t know anything about Joy Division, but it\u2019s one of those images that has always been about. When I was younger, I didn\u2019t know what it was or understand it, but something about the graphic always appealed. I later found out that Peter Saville\u2019s sleeve design <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/pop-culture-pulsar-origin-story-of-joy-division-s-unknown-pleasures-album-cover-video/\">depicts a frequency wave from the first known pulsar</a>, but it could equally be a landscape or depict musical frequencies. My experience of the music on records has always been influenced to some degree by the cover art, and this is dark and bleak and jagged, which is perfect for that album. After Royal Blood used my <a href=\"https://www.danhillier.com/artwork/pachamama----screen-print\">Pachamama image for their album</a>, their manager and I agreed we would have preferred not to have words on the cover. On the front of Unknown Pleasures, there\u2019s no band name or text, so no marketing or conventional enticement. It has something akin to the monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey about it, like a communication from somewhere unknown. It\u2019s mysterious, dark and self-contained.</p> <h2>Led Zeppelin \u2013 Houses of the Holy (1973)<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59f2d5ccb6ec68e9559c032db7275eee2a067004\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59f2d5ccb6ec68e9559c032db7275eee2a067004/186_170_1995_1995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Led Zeppelin \u2013 Houses of the Holy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Carson Ellis</em></strong><em>, award-winning illustrator and sleeve designer for the Decemberists, Weezer and Laura Veirs</em></p> <p>This has been my favourite album cover for as long as I can remember. <a href=\"http://www.hipgnosiscovers.com/\">Hipgnosis</a> did lots of the great 70s sleeves and this is weird, timeless and iconic. I recently did a cover for an album of Zeppelin covers called From the Land of Ice and Snow and <a href=\"http://www.jealousbutcher.com/products/various\">redrew the Houses of the Holy image in my own style</a>. So I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with it. It\u2019s a photo collage image of nymph-like, mermaid-like, naked children \u2013 actually a brother and sister \u2013 climbing Giant\u2019s Causeway, in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. Zeppelin combine blues with fantasy and JRR Tolkien, and all that is on the cover. It seems to signify otherworldliness, something primal and social taboos. There\u2019s something vaguely sexualised about the children, but whatever sexuality it\u2019s alluding to is subtle enough that you can shrug it off. On <a href=\"http://decemberistsshop.com/products/what-a-terrible-world-what-a-beautiful-world-cd\">the cover of the Decemberists\u2019 What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World</a>, I drew a stylised, flat depiction of a naked woman, with tiny pink dots for nipples. I was told that big stores wouldn\u2019t stock it. They were the most benign, non-sexual nipples that anyone ever had.</p> <h2>Miles Davis \u2013 Tutu (1986)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f05c46184bfe042b49e6c33f7493eaa273c9d75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f05c46184bfe042b49e6c33f7493eaa273c9d75/0_0_1620_1425/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miles Davis - Tutu.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"880\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><a href=\"http://ceyadams.com/\"><strong><em>Cey Adams</em></strong></a><em>, designer of Def Jam Recordings sleeves from the Beastie Boys, Public Enemy and Jay Z</em></p> <p>This is one of Miles Davis\u2019s last recordings, in his avant-garde period \u2013 it\u2019s named after Archbishop Desmond Tutu. It\u2019s just a stark photograph by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/oct/08/irving-penn-obituary\">Irving Penn</a> of Miles looking straight on, and the edges are faded black [the cover was designed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jan/29/eiko-ishioka\">Eiko Ishioka</a>]. I was taken by the fact that an artist could have a cover without his name on it, and Miles Davis was obviously so popular that he could do that. Miles always had very powerful features, and the texture and detail in his face shows the journey of his career and how much he put into it. I was drawn to the album by that intense, beautiful stare. I modelled my career on Miles in terms of wanting to push boundaries. For example, Public Enemy\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_a_Black_Planet#/media/File:Fear_of_a_Black_Planet.jpg\">Fear of a Black Planet</a> was conceptual art, which no one had done in hip-hop before. However, I was so moved by the Tutu cover that when the time came to do LL Cool J\u2019s greatest hits album, All World, I <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_World:_Greatest_Hits#/media/File:All_World_-_LL_Cool_J.jpg\">applied the same idea to an Albert Watson photograph of LL</a>. There was type on the front, but it was on a shinkwrap that peeled off. It was my homage to Tutu.</p> <h2>Parliament \u2013 Motor Booty Affair (1978)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c674e1a77eed3a51e3c91ca3d03b962d77940c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c674e1a77eed3a51e3c91ca3d03b962d77940c9/0_0_1092_1082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parliament \u2013 Motor Booty Affair.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"991\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><a href=\"http://josephbuckingham.com/\"><strong><em>Joe Buckingham</em></strong></a><em>, designer of various De La Soul sleeves including De La Soul Is Dead</em></p> <p>I\u2019ve always liked album sleeves that double as construction kits. I had a Jefferson Airplane album that you could take apart and build into a fully three-dimensional cigar box. The inner sleeve was an image of marijuana, and that sat in the box, so it looked as if it was filled with grass. In this field, though, this Parliament cover is king and is still my all-time favourite sleeve. It was a gatefold with a pop-up element. If you laid the album flat, this fantasy castle popped up along with various characters you could cut out and stand up in the castle. There were tons of illustrations, and the cover featured a giant bird coming down on the album\u2019s Sir Nose character. There was just so much to look at in <a href=\"http://overvision.com/\">Overton Loyd</a>\u2019s artwork. It really piqued my imagination. I think subconsciously the starkness and simplicity of the cover image against a white background seeped into how I designed <a href=\"http://typo-graphical.com/de-la-soul-is-dead/\">De La Soul Is Dead</a>.</p> <h2>Marvin Gaye \u2013 Here, My Dear (1978)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0df8e872e3e7a8024a1cebf7a4b823cb289a914e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0df8e872e3e7a8024a1cebf7a4b823cb289a914e/0_0_1024_1024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marvin Gaye \u2013 Here, My Dear.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><a href=\"http://mrscottdesign.com/\"><strong><em>Scott Sandler</em></strong></a><em>, Grammy-nominated designer of artwork for everyone from Def Jam to Lil Wayne to the Rolling Stones </em></p> <p>I love this because of the story behind it and the way the cover works with the music. In the mid-70s, Marvin Gaye had had two enormous albums in What\u2019s Going On and Let\u2019s Get It On, but was going through an acrimonious divorce from Anna Gordy. They agreed a deal whereby she wouldn\u2019t get any money, but would get all the proceeds of his next album, which looked guaranteed to be the biggest record ever. Instead, he sabotaged the deal by making a wilfully uncommercial album, full of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ74DQ-HWxQ\">songs about their relationship</a>, although it\u2019s now seen as another classic. Gaye gave Michael Bryan, the artist, very specific instructions, so the cover features the singer looking like a Greek god. The artwork includes the words \u201clove and marriage\u201d and \u201cjudgment\u201d and it unfolds to a picture of him handing her this itsy-bitsy, teeny-tiny record. That\u2019s dark, but mostly a record just features a photo of the band. This is a total concept, a snapshot of his state of mind and an amazing art piece.</p> <h2>U2 \u2013 Boy (1980)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09b2e0fe7044ce6da1c7a9ea73e897be2f7403df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09b2e0fe7044ce6da1c7a9ea73e897be2f7403df/0_0_1398_1380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"U2 \u2013 Boy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"987\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Alison Fielding</em></strong><em>, Beggars Banquet Group creative director, who has designed for the Prodigy, the Specials and the Horrors</em></p> <p>When I was about 13, I heard <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2BqLlVHlWA\">I Will Follow</a> when I was listening to the John Peel show on headphones. I thought it was amazing, and immediately went to this little local shop that sold TVs as well as records, and ordered it. At that point, I had no idea what it would look like. When I got it, I just thought it was so beautiful, I stared at it for hours. I don\u2019t care much for the graphics, but it\u2019s very evocative of a time in my life that shaped my love of music, and there\u2019s something almost Mona Lisa-like about the photograph on the sleeve. Does it capture innocence, or something darker? They <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/child-appeared-u2-album-covers-boy-war-grown-31-years-article-1.964294\">used the same boy two albums later for War</a>, by which point he has a split lip. So there\u2019s a narrative developing. When I was about 13 or 14, I had this big blue Adidas bag for school, and I wrote \u201cU2\u201d on it in really big lettering in ballpoint pen, but messily and badly. That was my first attempt at graphics.</p> <h2>Bj\u00f6rk \u2013 Homogenic (1997)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0464af4f6342187a7c71647e7ca405f79f818b81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0464af4f6342187a7c71647e7ca405f79f818b81/0_0_1404_1404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bjork - Homogenic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Rochelle Nembhard</em></strong><em>, who worked on the acclaimed cover for Petite Noir\u2019s La Vie Est Belle</em></p> <p>I like covers that relate directly to the musician, more than abstract images. I like some abstract images, but those covers could be anyone. Homogenic is a piece of art, and the fact that she used Alexander McQueen to design it was amazing. It\u2019s a fusion between African and Asian \u2013 the African necklaces and the Asian dress \u2013 that stands the test of time. I love all Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s covers for that reason \u2013 they all show an aspect of her. The visual aspect of music, the album cover, is important, because it is a picture of the music, depicting the sound. It should be so much more than just a one-dimensional image \u2013 it has to be the face of the music. That\u2019s what I was trying to do <a href=\"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/22275/306b06ea.jpg\">with Petite Noir, working with the artist Lina Viktor</a>.

The wonky type looks like it has been cut out and stuck on by hand. There\u2019s another musician awkwardly cropped in the photo of Elvis. Nowadays, the record company would ask you to Photoshop him out. The immediacy of the image and graphics make a statement of intent: \u201cHere I am.\u201d Many years and genres after that was released, the same aesthetic inspired me when I came across this EP of Scritti Politti\u2019s second John Peel session in Chick-A-Boom Records in Sutton Market, some years after it came out in 1979 on Rough Trade Records. The sleeve was just a plastic bag with two bits of photocopied paper in it. One of them listed the entire costs of making the record, including \u00a365 for 5,000 plastic covers. The other photocopy was of a bag of crisps, a badge and some sugar. It demystified the entire process and I realised that I could do something similar at the local library.

It\u2019s holding up a funhouse mirror to society.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2c929b766ec60a5169052dd47b7df1ba92d9e29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2c929b766ec60a5169052dd47b7df1ba92d9e29/0_0_926_509/500.jpg\" alt=\"Seven tombs of gloom: a screengrab from Doomocracy\u2019s Kickstarter campaign.\" width=\"500\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seven tombs of gloom: a screengrab from Doomocracy\u2019s Kickstarter campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reyes and Nato hope to offer about 400-500 people a night a ghastly, dramatic interactive trip that takes in gun nuts, genetically modified crops, climate change, deadly fast-food chains and, looming over Doomocracy\u2019s entrance, a chimeric effigy that\u2019s part Statue of Liberty, part Trojan Horse, and, in Reyes\u2019 view, entirely the embodiment of American foreign policy. \u201cThe USA doesn\u2019t have true representation,\u201d he argues, \u201cand yet they say they\u2019re exporting democracy around the world.\u201d</p> <p>That may all sound as satirical as it is scary. Nevertheless the artist \u2013 who has previously staged a fine-art version of <a href=\"http://camstl.org/about-pedro-reyes-and-sanatorium/\">a psychiatric sanatorium at different galleries around the world</a> and overseen <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/01/25/265794611/artist-transforms-guns-to-make-music-literally\">a programme to repurpose firearms as musical instruments</a> \u2013 is deeply serious in his examination of fear within today\u2019s political landscape.</p> <p>\u201cThese days, politicians are trying to create fear in order to take power,\u201d Reyes says, \u201cso it\u2019s quite an experiment to be dealing with the production of fear and its political uses.\u201d</p> <p>He is also highly respectful of the funhouse trope, partly because it is so familiar to people who might not necessarily be avid gallery goers.</p> <p>\u201cPretty much everyone can picture a horror house,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will, if you forgive the paradox, deal with political issues in a very democratic way. Everyone can engage with the form.\u201d</p> <p>Reyes and Thompson are keen to ensure Doomocracy keeps pace with events and have been writing and rewriting the dramatic scenarios to reflect the changing nature of the electoral race.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been workshopping the scripts today,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cIt\u2019s a fluid process. The ground is moving fast this election, it\u2019s hard to keep up.\u201d</p> <p>Reyes, who visited both commercial haunted houses and guerrilla theatre groups in preparation for the show, also says Doomocracy reflects a general hopelessness within contemporary politics, both in the US and elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do people vote against their own interests?\u201d Reyes says. \u201cIs it that we have brainwashed people to make the wrong decisions? There\u2019s a feeling in the US that it\u2019s a downer to have to choose between the [presidential] options. But it\u2019s elsewhere too; it can be said of Mexico and many other places around the world. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> was almost like a democratic, rightwing coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this gloomy view, Doomocracy is still able to engage with some of the norms of campaign fundraising. Its <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2026016011/doomocracy-a-haunted-house-with-pedro-reyes-and-cr\">Kickstarter page</a> looks set to reach its goal of $80,000 by its deadline of 29 September, offering suitably doom-laden swag for its pledgers, including Doomocracy pennants and buttons, and \u201cYes We Can\u2019t\u201d bumper stickers.</p> <p>With all this left-leaning pessimism, Reyes\u2019 haunted house looks unlikely to attract many Trump voters. However, Creative Time\u2019s executive director, Katie Hollander, argues that the work doesn\u2019t favour either side. \u201cIt\u2019s not a commentary on the candidates, more a commentary on the issues,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Indeed, Reyes hopes to take in wider political issues unlikely to be addressed by either party this election year. \u201cIt will deal with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/27/-sp-americas-mental-health-care-system-crisis\">mental health</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/feb/03/us-war-on-drugs-impact-in-latin-american\">excessive criminalisation of drug use</a>, and the increasing role of the medical industry as a kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/20/healthcare-drugspolicy\">white-collar drug dealer</a>,\u201d the artist says. \u201cThere\u2019ll be stuff on the food industry too, and equity or the lack of social mobility \u2013 those universal issues, that are experienced in every part of the world.\u201d</p> <p>While this all may sound nihilistic, Reyes hopes Doomocracy could be liberating too. \u201cUsually my art is more about hope, but on this occasion it is a dark project, and offers more of a space for catharsis,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter all, Halloween is a moment to go crazy. That is the role of carnival.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, does he genuinely expect Doomocracy to actually change any visitors\u2019 minds about the issues examined? Won\u2019t most already agree with his position on, say, pharmaceuticals and gun crime?</p> <p>\u201cThere will be people who love it, people who hate it, people who feel empowered, and people who feel offended,\u201d says Reyes. \u201cMaking art is one way to elaborate and engage with reality.\u201d</p> <p>And this autumn, at a time when truth seems if not stranger, then at least as spooky as fiction, one route for meaningful political engagement appears to lie through Doomocracy\u2019s funhouse doors.</p>",
  "<p>Instagram is one of those modern day inventions that nobody knew they wanted until it was there.

Working as a travel agent by day and learning to code by night, he came up with the idea for a check-in app, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/instagram-used-to-be-called-brbn/373815/\">Burbn</a>. After mingling with investors in a bar, he secured half a million dollars and found someone with a \u201cshared interest in tinkering\u201d: Krieger. \u201cMy future flashed before my eyes talking to Kevin,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Of course, inventing one of the fastest-growing apps of all time wasn\u2019t without its ups and downs. Burbn stalled, leaving the entrepreneurs with all that cash to spend but no big idea. That came when Systrom was on holiday in Mexico, and it was a huge one: filters. But when Instagram launched, just one computer couldn\u2019t cope with demand from 25,000 users and the server crashed. \u201cWe built this thing and totally messed it up,\u201d sighs Systrom.</p> <p>At less than half an hour, these podcasts get straight to the point, allowing the modest entrepreneurs to tell their tales quickly, pumping out moments of inspiration. (The previous episode, in which Sara Blakely recalls pitching the idea of Spanx in a toilet, is great, too.) \u201cWhat problem are we solving?\u201d asks Systrom. \u201cShare something that people love and make sure that they feel great sharing it.\u201d He makes it sound obvious. Easy. But he\u2019s so modest he still has a slight feeling of disbelief at Instagram\u2019s success: when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/snoopdogg\">Snoop Dogg</a> signed up, he wondered if it was really him.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to say what makes one idea succeed where others have failed, but Instagram\u2019s creators credit giving people the right tool at the right time. \u201cThe world runs on luck,\u201d says Systrom. \u201cThe question is what you do with it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>If you like this, try \u2026</strong><em> </em><a href=\"http://www.thethingsthatmakeus.com/podcast/\"><em>The Things That Make Us</em></a></p>",

Capildeo is from Trinidad, raised in a patriarchal society in the empire\u2019s aftermath: if anyone has a right to the voice of \u201cthe migrant\u201d, it would be her. And then she spoke, as if addressing an invisible hawk. \u201cCome here, here, here: / if it\u2019s a tree you\u2019d sulk in, I am pine; / if earth, I\u2019m risen terracotta; / if it\u2019s all to air you\u2019d turn, turn to me.\u201d</p> <p>She told us the idea for her poem, \u201cHandfast\u201d, was inspired by a hunting glove belonging to Henry VIII, that most dominant of English kings. Hawks are Ted Hughes territory. A glove? No, Capildeo, winner of the best collection prize, was throwing down a gauntlet.</p> <p>She is, like the other poets honoured at this year\u2019s Forward prizes \u2013 Tiphanie Yanique, Sasha Dugdale \u2013 \u201cdiverse\u201d in the sense that she is not a white man with a senior post in academia or publishing. But to define these voices in this way seems crass. Pin them down at your peril.</p> <p>When I founded the Forward prizes in 1992, it was perfectly standard for anthologies of contemporary poetry to contain four times as many men than women \u2013 all, or almost all of them, white.</p> <p>This year, I reread the 25 Forward books of poetry, seeking from 1,600 poems just 100 for an anthology to mark our 25th anniversary, <em>100 Prized Poems</em> (Faber). I was looking for poems that felt fresh, that gave the \u201cfeeling of excitement and sense of fulfilment\u201d that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ts-eliot\">TS Eliot</a> declared characteristic of the best contemporary poetry. I included works that weren\u2019t by the winners or \u201cbig\u201d names, keeping an eye on readers new to poetry, as well as those steeped in it. Only when I counted did I realise that the book has nearly as many women as men speaking memorably and musically of the great human subjects: love, loss, wonder.</p>",

  "<p>Canada regularly detains hundreds of children who have run afoul of the country\u2019s immigration laws \u2013 including some who are held in correctional facilities and even in solitary confinement, according to a new report calling for sweeping reforms to the practice.<br></p> <p>Between 2010 and 2014, an average of 242 children were detained across Canada over immigration violations, according to the International Human Rights Program at the University of Toronto. Their report, released on Thursday, sheds light on these detentions, which range in length from days to several months, and calls for urgent reform to a Canadian practice that has attracted consistent criticism from the United Nations. </p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening with children in detention really runs counter to the narrative of Canada as a global human rights promoter,\u201d said Samer Muscati, the report\u2019s editor. \u201cCanada has signed international agreements, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which clearly states that any detention has to be done as a last resort and for the least amount of time possible.\u201d</p> <p>The practice of regularly detaining children is among the many issues that plague Canada\u2019s immigration detention system. Across the country, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has the power to detain non-citizens deemed to be a flight risk, who pose a threat to public safety or whose identities cannot be confirmed. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/17/canada-immigration-detention-deaths-border-services-agency\">Immigrant deaths expose 'legal black hole' of Canada's detention system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A lack of transparency and oversight mars the system, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/17/canada-immigration-detention-deaths-border-services-agency\">resulting in what critics have described as a \u201clegal black hole\u201d.</a> Since 2000, at least 15 people have died in the custody of the CBSA, including five who are thought to have died from natural causes and three by suicide. Six deaths remain attributed to unknown causes. </p> <p>Thursday\u2019s report focuses on the children \u2013 ranging from newborns to teenagers \u2013 ensnared in the same system. Some are formally detained. Others are Canadian citizens who are forced to choose between separating from parents who have been detained by immigration authorities or living in detention with their parents as de facto detainees. Those who stay with their parents still face family separation, in that they are held with their mother and have limited visits during the day with their father. </p> <p>The figures in the report probably underestimate the scale of the issue, said Muscati, as the data mostly reflects children who are formally detained. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have an accurate number or idea of how many children are informally detained.\u201d</p> <p>Those detained hail from around the world with children from sub-Saharan Africa making up the largest group, at 23% of the children detained. The average length of detention is 10 days for children who are formally detained. For those who are held informally with their parents, the average length of the detention stretches to nearly 30 days. \u201cBecause under the law they\u2019re invisible, their interests aren\u2019t identified and represented,\u201d said Muscati. \u201cSo they actually languish in these facilities for longer periods of time than formally detained children.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb82298697c714a08d2c9ef6e287a29557a7dfc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb82298697c714a08d2c9ef6e287a29557a7dfc4/0_98_2843_1705/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Across the country, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has the power to detain non-citizens deemed to be a flight risk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most children are held in medium-security immigration holding centres. But a small number have wound up in correctional facilities or police stations across the country. </p> <p>The report also flagged what Muscati called \u201ca whole other, really horrible scenario\u201d, referring to findings on the use of solitary confinement for two, unaccompanied 16-year-old boys. One of them \u2013 a Syrian boy who had attempted to claim refugee status after entering Canada from the US \u2013 was left in isolation for three weeks. Loath to put the young males in the women\u2019s section and worried that they may be at risk in the men\u2019s section, authorities chose to place them in solitary confinement. </p> <p>Even just a few days in detention can cause serious and long-lasting psychological harm to children. Studies have shown children who are detained experience increased symptoms of post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression, and are more likely to contemplate suicide. These symptoms often persist long after the children are released. </p> <p>As less than 2% of those detained are considered a threat to public safety, the report highlights alternatives, such as those used in Sweden and Hong Kong, which allow children to reside with their families in the community through the use of reporting obligations, financial deposits and guarantees, or electronic monitoring. </p> <p>Responding to the report, the CBSA said it was aware of the issue and said \u201ctangible steps\u201d are in the works to address the situation. The agency said it has been working to \u201creset the immigration detention program\u201d to increase the use of alternatives and eliminate the detention of minors, except in the most limited and exceptional circumstances.</p> <p>The agency falls under the portfolio of Canada\u2019s public safety ministry. In a statement to the Guardian, the office of Ralph Goodale, Canada\u2019s public safety minister, noted that the minister has been clear about wanting to try to avoid housing children in detention facilities, \u201cas much as humanly possible.\u201d</p> <p>The agency plans to expand alternatives to detention and will begin publishing statistics on immigration detention in the near future. \u201cAs well, additional mental health training for staff at Immigration Holding Centres has already begun.\u201d <br></p> <p>Their efforts were noted by those behind the report, who said that recent months have seen a decline in the number of children taken into custody. </p> <p>\u201cAfter years of silence and inaction, the Canadian government and CBSA are taking serious steps that will hopefully bring us closer to ending child detention and family separation,\u201d said Hanna Gros, one of the report\u2019s co-authors. \u201cBut Ottawa needs to move quickly and deliberately to end the needless suffering of children and their parents.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>If Hollywood is to be believed, the most fascinating parts of a life are the rise and the fall \u2014 the ascent up the mountain and the inevitable tumble back to sea level.

John Ford\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJKWguqabUU\">Young Mr Lincoln</a> \u2013 like Wilson, released by Fox, though five years earlier \u2013 is a lightly factual origin story about Abraham Lincoln. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PT_109_(film)\">PT 109</a> \u2013 which hit cinemas five months before the assassination of its real-life inspiration, John F Kennedy \u2013 took inspiration from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_Torpedo_Boat_PT-109\">JFK\u2019s command of a navy boat</a> during the second world war. In both cases, these films seek to build a throughline from the lessons learned in an early conflict to the rise to power. JFK discovers how to lead men through crisis. Lincoln learns fairness and compassion by coming to the aid of two brothers wrongfully accused of murder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c58ca24091d5c45d0df10f3aa4ca643ffc126fe8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c58ca24091d5c45d0df10f3aa4ca643ffc126fe8/0_87_2714_1628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Canonising the president ...

Southside dramatises the first date between Barack and eventual first lady Michelle Obama. Barry, directed by <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/vice\">Vice on HBO</a> host and documentarian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikram_Gandhi\">Vikram Gandhi</a>, depicts Barack\u2019s struggles to adapt to living in New York City in the early 1980s.</p> <p>Southside director Richard Tanne attempted to make a film that was both about Barack and Michelle Obama, but also a film that could stand on its own as a romance. \u201cMy job was just to build a credible love story, but the dramatic irony of the film is we all know what they went on to accomplish, the history that they made, however not everybody feels the same way about them,\u201d he explains over the phone.</p> <p>Southside covers only a single day in the life of these two people, rather than the biographical sprawl of Oliver Stone\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/03/nixon-oliver-stone-reel-history\">Nixon</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/12/reel-history-george-bush-w-biopic-josh-brolin\">W</a>, works that are significantly more critical of their subjects than the average film about a president. The film begins before the date, as Michelle Robinson and Barack Obama \u2013 colleagues at a law firm in Chicago \u2013 get ready, chat with their parents and express trepidation over the upcoming rendezvous. Is it a date? Michelle is convinced it isn\u2019t. Barack\u2019s mother asks if the new girl is white. She isn\u2019t. Tanne plays up the initial friction, casting some doubt on the relationship, even if the outcome is predetermined.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14dcbbbd62ce9b38264831757307ec04b19b97ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14dcbbbd62ce9b38264831757307ec04b19b97ec/0_185_1724_1034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President as war hero ...

She skipped second and third grade and was already a second-year associate at the biggest firm in Chicago after graduating Harvard Law.\u201d Michelle\u2019s prodigious talent, her success to that point in her career, and her keen understanding of the unsavoury aspects of office politics make her initial scepticism over dating a subordinate understandable. \u201cShe was well ahead of where Barack was professionally at that time,\u201d Tanne says.</p> <p>Michelle is played by Tika Sumpter, who has popped up in a variety of high-profile projects \u2013 from a Madea movie and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/13/ride-along-2-review-ice-cube-kevin-hart\">Ride Along 2</a> to the James Brown biopic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/01/get-on-up-review-james-brown-biopic\">Get On Up</a>. She was the first actor cast and is also a producer on Southside. The search for Barack was far more complicated. \u201cWe read about 30 Los Angeles-based actors and we got tapes sent in from elsewhere around the country,\u201d Tanne says. \u201cEveryone we read was a terrific actor, but they weren\u2019t quite Obama. They couldn\u2019t get the president out of their minds. I just needed them to be a guy trying to get a girl.\u201d</p> <p>The role eventually went to newcomer Parker Sawyers, who does a remarkable job capturing the essence of one of the most famous men in the world. \u201cI did the audition, but it was a straight-on impersonation. It was not nuanced, it wasn\u2019t even very good acting,\u201d says Sawyers. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything back, and then it came back around in April 2015. I spoke to Rich for 20 minutes. He says: \u2018Dude, drop the impersonation. Just play yourself. Just be you. No Barack.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"483950f86af83ea05557edd6a1b0a72697663c6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/483950f86af83ea05557edd6a1b0a72697663c6a/0_0_1787_1072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Stone\u2019s Nixon, starring Anthony Hopkins, left, is considerably more critical of its subject than most presidential biopics.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Stone\u2019s Nixon, starring Anthony Hopkins (left) is considerably more critical of its subject than most presidential biopics. Photograph: Allstar/Buena Vista</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/BUENA VISTA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The note worked and Sawyers got the part. \u201cI\u2019m sure President Obama, when we don\u2019t see him, acts a different way.\u201d That\u2019s the trick of playing a celebrity before they were a celebrity. They are fundamentally not the same person that they are today \u2013 less aware of people watching them, unaffected by the spotlight and significantly less performative. Sawyers and Sumpter don\u2019t really tip their hats to the Obamas\u2019 future role in American history until key moments in the film\u2019s final act, but even then, it\u2019s all quite subtle and never distracts from Tanne\u2019s \u201ccredible love story\u201d.</p> <p>The most curious aspect of both Barry (which is to be released globally by Netflix) and Southside is that they are both coming out while Obama is still in office, which gives them another thing in common with PT 109. I tell Tanne that I was initially put off by the idea of a film about the Obamas coming so soon after they ascended to the White House. The history is too recent, I say. Of course, it\u2019s not that recent, as the first date was over 20 years ago. Stripped of any political or historical significance, the film is simply a clever way to tell one of the most common stories there is: the initial spark of love between two interesting people.</p> <p>\u201cBack in 2007, I was really taken by them as a couple, the way they looked at each other, the way they flirted,\u201d Tanne says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very authentic, sexy, and vibrant connection between them. I find that to be rare in people that you meet, everyday folks, and even rarer in public figures.\u201d How difficult it would be to pull off this movie about most other recent presidents. The Obamas are unique in that their affection pops off the screen whenever they share a stage.</p> <p>I ask Tanne how Obama\u2019s final presidential legacy might affect the way his movie is perceived in the future. Will it be a Young Mr Lincoln-esque work that spawns an enduring myth? Or will it be viewed with a sceptical eye, the way something like Wilson is consumed, as the public begins to sour on the Obama era? He pauses. Real history, he thinks, \u201cshades the movie. As the legacy evolves, I can imagine that audiences will see the film differently, as the pendulum swings one way and then the other way, there\u2019s going to be constantly changing perceptions of the movie as relates to his legacy.\u201d What can never be undone is the barrier Barack and Michelle broke, and the impact that will have on the US, for decades to come.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erpUF2ToUls\">Southside With You</a> is released in the UK on 30 September</p>",
  "<p>Atl\u00e9tico Madrid took the free-kick but their captain acted like they hadn\u2019t and Koke Resurrecci\u00f3n didn\u2019t get up. He was still sitting where Arda Turan had left him, two team-mates over him, two opponents in front of him and the referee looking down at him, seven men standing in a five-metre square, when Filipe Lu\u00eds poked the ball to Gabi Fern\u00e1ndez. An eighth man walked by, barely a metre from him. Barcelona\u2019s full-back turned towards the area and their deep midfielder ambled across, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/778890858800287744/photo/1\">retaking positions they wouldn\u2019t get to</a>. Gabi might as well have whistled and looked the other way. It was like he wasn\u2019t really playing \u2013 until he played them all.</p> <p>Somehow it didn\u2019t feel real and by the time Barcelona realised it was, the game had changed. Suddenly, <em>bang</em>! Like the fish that doesn\u2019t know the Wobbegong shark is there <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbv2DhcKAh4\">until he feels its teeth close around him</a>, they had been caught. Gabi stopped ambling and activated everyone, hitting a short, sharp ball forward. Gerard Piqu\u00e9 saw it and rushed to the scene but Fernando Torres got there before him. Torres nudged it first time through Piqu\u00e9\u2019s legs to \u00c1ngel Correa. Javier Mascherano came across, slipped, fell on his face, and Correa put the ball past Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen, in off the post.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/barcelona-atletico-madrid-lionel-lessi-la-liga\">Barcelona lose Lionel Messi to groin injury during draw with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ball had been rolling less than 10 seconds; it was six since Gabi had lit the fuse. Koke had only just got to his feet. Torres had only been on the pitch a minute and so had Correa, their first touches an assist and a goal respectively. As for Leo Messi, he hadn\u2019t been <em>off</em> the pitch much longer, temporarily taking a piece of everyone\u2019s mind with him 30 seconds before Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s two subs headed in the other direction. It had all happened so fast. First Barcelona lost Sergio Busquets, then they lost Messi. Now they had lost the victory. Not just any victory, either \u2013 one of the biggest of the season. All that happened in nine minutes; the goal happened in nine seconds.</p> <p>For Barcelona, it had been going so well too. This was the biggest game of the season so far \u2013 the \u201cother <em>cl\u00e1sico</em>,\u201d Marca called it; the \u201cvice-<em>cl\u00e1sico</em>\u201d, AS said \u2013 and it came as an opportunity. Over at the Bernab\u00e9u, Sergio Ramos had Sergio Ramos-ed \u2013 giving away the first goal with a handball before falling to the floor holding his face, and then making up for it by scoring with a header \u2013 and Madrid\u2019s record-equalling 16-game winning run had come to an end with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/real-madrid-villarreal-la-liga-match-report\">a 1-1 draw against Villarreal</a>. Win and Barcelona would be just one point behind Madrid at the top; Atl\u00e9tico, meanwhile, would trail them by four.</p> <p>Barcelona were winning too. Ivan Rakitic had put them 1-0 up a little before half-time with a header from Andr\u00e9s Iniesta\u2019s delivery, the 11th time he has opened the scoring for them. He and Iniesta were everywhere and, while chances for a second were few, space limited, Barcelona were dominating, Piqu\u00e9 impeccable, Busquets controlling. As one commentator put it: \u201cThe problem for Atl\u00e9tico is that there\u2019s only one ball, and it\u2019s Barcelona\u2019s.\u201d But after 51 minutes Busquets went off, suffering illness. And four minutes after that, Messi pulled up, his hand reaching for his groin. Things were to about change. Messi tried to move but couldn\u2019t. He sat, pulled down his sock, untied his boot and departed, kissed by Iniesta and sung off by supporters, eventually taking up his place on the bench. From pulling up to leaving, more than four minutes had passed. Ninety seconds after that, Atl\u00e9tico got a free-kick: Filipe Lu\u00eds, Gabi, look away, whistle, bang: Torres, Correa, 1-1.</p> <p>It had all happened so fast. It had all happened together, too. Diego Simeone insisted that the goal\u2019s arrival so soon after Messi\u2019s departure was \u201ccoincidental\u201d, and rightly noted that Atl\u00e9tico had improved since the start of the second half \u2013 there had been two shots before the goal, both theirs \u2013 but Luis Enrique said: \u201cI think that when Leo went off, some doubt was created.\u201d It felt like there was indeed something in that idea, like Messi took something with him; as if he opened the door. Just a fraction, just a moment, and just enough for Atl\u00e9tico to burst through it.</p> <p>If so, most teams wouldn\u2019t have even spotted the gap; this felt like a very Atl\u00e9tico goal, the kind of instant that defines them and their manager. Intensity is not just physical; it is mental too. Always in the game, even when you think you\u2019re not \u2013 and especially when, momentarily, the other team is not. Always alert to that moment. To use Graeme Souness\u2019s phrase, always ready to \u201cfind the dope\u201d \u2013 that chink, that weak link, that fraction of a second when someone switches off \u2013 and able to resist long enough to be able to do so. Able, too, to see the opportunity to go for the throat. \u201cThey made the first change, a double change, and got the goal,\u201d Luis Enrique said, even if Correa did grin: \u201cthat wasn\u2019t <em>exactly</em> the plan.\u201d</p> <p>There was still half an hour to go but the game had changed now, and there would be no more goals. Ninety minutes. Nine seconds. They ended up weighing the same.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06c1ee3cbfd3c629051ac0cfa6f8ed92a8834498\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06c1ee3cbfd3c629051ac0cfa6f8ed92a8834498/0_0_1649_1343/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lionel Messi gets a peck on the head from Andr\u00e9s Iniesta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"814\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lionel Messi gets a peck on the head from Andr\u00e9s Iniesta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Albert Gea/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Down on the bench Messi occasionally shifted uncomfortably, like an old man trying to get up out of his rocking chair, as he watched his team chase a winner. There were some half chances too, mostly through Neymar, but this felt different now. In fact, you couldn\u2019t help wondering if, with Messi and Busquets off, with Luis Su\u00e1rez struggling, Atl\u00e9tico might have done more to take all three points: they\u2019d gone for the equaliser and got it; perhaps they could have got the winner if they had gone for that too. \u201cDid you lack ambition?\u201d Gabi was asked. \u201cThis team never lacks ambition,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>\u201cWe changed in the second half: this is the team we are,\u201d Simeone insisted. \u201cThe result was not what we expected and I think it was not what we deserved,\u201d Luis Enrique said, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s no need to flog ourselves over it.\u201d</p> <p>On one level at least, he was right: a draw against Atl\u00e9tico is no disaster \u2013 even if some Barcelona fans appear to greet every result as a disaster \u2013 and still less without Messi and Busquets. This is Atl\u00e9tico, not just anyone. There is a certain merit in seeing Antoine Griezmann playing all over the pitch, defending deep at times, in seeing Sa\u00fal have so little impact. \u201cWe did not let them create those transitions that they are dangerous in,\u201d Luis Enrique said. But still, the sense of loss was palpable. Instead of a solitary point at the top, Madrid maintain a three-point lead over Barcelona, four over Atl\u00e9tico (and two over Sevilla).</p> <p>That sense of loss was greater with Messi sitting there silently, ice on his groin. He will be out for three weeks according to the club, because of a torn muscle in the groin. He will miss games against Sporting and Celta in the league and Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach in the Champions League. He may miss the next international break too.</p> <p>He should. Suffering with pelvis problems, Messi probably should not have gone last time. He also probably shouldn\u2019t have played when he came back. Against Alav\u00e9s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/12/alaves-barcelona-la-liga\">he wasn\u2019t supposed to</a>. He started on the bench, only to be called into action \u2013 but he could not rescue his side. \u201cWe need to protect him but with this calendar that\u2019s not going to be easy,\u201d Luis Enrique admitted, yet he surely knows that he must anyway. Better to bring him back fit than bring him back fast. It\u2019s not like they don\u2019t have other players and when Messi was absent around this time last season, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/nov/02/neymar-luis-suarez-barcelona-messi\">Neymar and Su\u00e1rez led them</a> into the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/nov/23/barcelona-clasico-destruction-real-madrid-on-their-knees-sid-lowe\">cl\u00e1sico</a></em>. The Brazilian in particular took <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/nov/20/neymar-lionel-messi-barcelona-clasico-real-madrid\">a step forward</a>. There\u2019s no doubt that it will have an impact, though. After all, Luis Enrique insisted: \u201cLosing Messi is losing football: we all lose.\u201d</p> <p>Real Madrid don\u2019t. And Atl\u00e9tico didn\u2019t, either. A free-kick saw to that, even if most failed to see that it had been taken at all.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 So Valencia swallowed the dog to catch the cat, to catch the bird, to catch the spider, to catch the fly, and they still don\u2019t know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/19/valencia-bottom-la-liga-sid-lowe\">why they swallowed the fly</a>. Pako Ayestar\u00e1n <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/20/valencia-sack-pako-ayestaran-la-liga\">has been sacked</a>. On Thursday night against Alav\u00e9s, the fifth managerial spell since the beginning of last season starts up \u2013 Nuno, followed by Voro and Neville, followed by the other Neville, followed by Ayestar\u00e1n, followed by Voro again. He\u2019s on his fourth spell, all as caretaker, and he has no ambition to take over permanently, even though he has the best record in the club\u2019s history, statistically. And so, the sixth spell will start as soon as they can find someone else to take over. The choice was Marcelino, although RFEF rules say he can\u2019t take the job as he has already coached someone this season. Ah, argue Valencia, but he hasn\u2019t: he was ditched by Villarreal before the season actually started. It\u2019s a mess, alright.</p> <p>\u2022 So Pako\u2019s gone. Paco next? Only Valencia are worse than Paco J\u00e9mez\u2019s Granada and he seems to be almost <em>trying</em> to talk his way to the sack. \u201cWe have to score three goals to win a game and only very few teams can do that. Either we stop this or we have no chance of competing in this division,\u201d he said. He was speaking after his team was beaten 2-1 by Athletic, for whom Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda scored another belter.</p> <p>\u2022 Real Madrid\u2019s winning run ends on 16. It finished 1-1 with Bruno dinking in a lovely Panenka penalty, handed to them by Sergio Ramos. Villarreal were well-organised at the Bernab\u00e9u, with Bruno and Trigueros especially impressive in the middle, but Madrid were flat in the first half and, while they improved in the second (Zidane called it \u201cspectacular\u201d), this time they <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.com/club/real-madrid/86/blog/post/2951227/real-madrid-winning-their-way-against-sporting-reveals-squad-flaws\">ran out of time</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re not always going to win at the end,\u201d Zidane said. They might have here, but truth be told they\u2019ve not played that well over the last three games.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d1349ddf9cd8158d45bbf830904df6e14da1b28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d1349ddf9cd8158d45bbf830904df6e14da1b28/0_0_2734_1888/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Real Madrid\u2019s Sergio Ramos celebrates his equaliser.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Real Madrid\u2019s Sergio Ramos celebrates his equaliser.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergio Perez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2022 Gus Poyet came into the press conference carrying his laptop. \u201cHave you seen it or do you want me to show it to you?\u201d he asked. Oh, they had seen it. \u201cIt\u201d was the goal that Betis had wrongly disallowed \u2013 a lovely goal too \u2013 as they went down 1-0 in the Seville derby. \u201cWe have been denied a victory,\u201d Poyet said. \u201cAnd it keeps happening. You can\u2019t invent things that haven\u2019t happened.\u201d Mostly, the derby wasn\u2019t great in terms of football, but it was enjoyable as ever in a cartoonish sort of way, and it was as loud as ever. Oh, and Sami Nasri was good. He also appears to have learnt Spanish very, very quickly and was keen to practice it on his Betis opponents.</p> <p>\u2022 Twenty-two minutes in and Las Palmas were 2-0 and a man down at Real Sociedad \u2013 and Carlos Vela had scored too. Yes, <em>that</em> Carlos Vela. Which was pretty unexpected. It finished 4-1. The man sent off was Kevin-Prince Boateng, guilty of making a save without being the goalkeeper. Good news: Sergio Canales is back in action at last.</p> <p>\u2022 Boom! This week\u2019s <em>golazo</em> came from M\u00e1laga\u2019s Youssef En-Nesyri, a 19-year-old who came from the youth team, via Maghreb Fez, from whom he joined as part of a four-player package costing \u20ac125,000. He scored a belting winner against Eibar. \u201cI felt like crying when it went in,\u201d he said. </p> <p><strong>Results: </strong>M\u00e1laga 2-1 Eibar, Sevilla 1\u20130 Betis, Real Madrid 1\u20131 Villarreal, Celta 2\u20131 Sporting, Real Sociedad 4\u20131 Las Palmas, Granada 1\u20132 Athletic, Barcelona 1\u20131 Atl\u00e9tico.

  "<p>French children\u2019s services are struggling to cope with a dramatic surge in unaccompanied refugee children who have abandoned plans to travel to the UK and now want to remain in France.</p> <p>In the past three months staff employed by the main French charity working with refugee children in Calais have had to turn away between 15 and 35 unaccompanied refugee children every day because they have no beds for them in the emergency shelter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/22/call-for-calais-child-refugees-to-be-given-uk-safeguarding-protection\">Call for Calais child refugees to be given UK safeguarding protection</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since July around 95% of the unaccompanied children who come to the charity for assistance say they want to remain in France permanently, according to Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Roger, director of the charity\u2019s child refugee centre. This is a huge change from last year, when only 15% of the 1,483 unaccompanied children that staff registered at the France Terre d\u2019Asile emergency shelter in Saint Omer, said they wanted to stay; the remaining 85% returned to the Calais camp after a five-day break, to try to travel on to the UK.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cA few things have happened that have persuaded children to stay. Since July, and the Brexit vote, the migrants are wondering what will happen to them if they turn up in Britain. We are not sure it is connected to Brexit, but there is a fear of what kind of welcome foreigners will have there now,\u201d Roger said.<br></p> <p>The rise in numbers opting to stay in France is also a reflection of the fact that increased security and fencing by the port has made it much harder and much more dangerous to attempt to cross to the UK illegally. This week, workers began to build the foundations of a four-metre high, kilometre-long <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/uk-immigration-minister-confirms-work-will-begin-on-big-new-wall-in-calais\">wall</a> between the camp and the motorway, estimated to cost \u00a31.9m.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67b0cd77671794783d7ec4015d8ec97185ec7cda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67b0cd77671794783d7ec4015d8ec97185ec7cda/0_45_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unaccompanied minors seeking asylum learn French at the home for young refugees run by French charity Terre d\u2019Asile.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unaccompanied minors seeking asylum learn French at the home for young refugees run by French charity Terre d\u2019Asile.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In parallel there has been a concerted drive by charities working in the Calais camp to inform children that, aside from the dangers of trying to make an illegal crossing, it is often easier to get long-term permission to remain in France than it is in the UK.</p> <p>Last Friday a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/afghan-boy-killed-in-calais-in-attempt-to-climb-on-to-lorry-to-uk\">14-year-old boy</a> from Afghanistan died when he fell from a lorry and was hit by a car on the motorway leading to the port; he was the third asylum-seeking child to be killed in the Calais area this year. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt is getting harder and harder to cross the frontier. There is a bigger police presence, there are more checks, the barrier is bigger. It was always dangerous, but it is much more dangerous now for the children, and so they are forced to take much greater risks,\u201d Roger said. \u201cIt is also more dangerous in the camp in Calais itself. You have 10,000 people in a confined space and tensions are getting worse, and the children are more vulnerable.\u201d<br></p> <p>A census carried out by the charity<a href=\"http://www.helprefugees.org.uk/\"> Help Refugees </a>estimated this week that the camp population has increased to around 10,188, a 12% increase on last month, with 1,179 minors, of whom 87% are traveling alone; the youngest unaccompanied child is eight years old. </p> <p>Almost a third of the children are from Afghanistan, a quarter from Sudan and a quarter from Eritrea. Police clashed with camp residents on Wednesday, using teargas grenades, and violent incidents are increasing.<br></p> <p>The current emergency provision of just 45 beds for refugee children in Saint Omer was completely inadequate, Roger said. Two further emergency centres, one with 70 beds and one with 75 places, will be opened in November and early 2017, but these are also likely to be insufficient to house the rising numbers, he said. Children eventually move into foster care or more permanent housing, but they often need to stay in the emergency shelter for weeks, while their application to remain is processed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/theresa-may-refugees-welfare-migrant\">Theresa May isn\u2019t interested in refugees\u2019 welfare.

It is difficult to explain to them why there are no places,\u201d Roger said. \u201cIt will be worse when it gets colder, when there is water up to your knees in the camp.\u201d<br></p> <p>When the charity turns children away, staff alert the local social services, but usually they are also unable to offer a bed, so the children are forced to return to tents or huts in the Calais camp, or if they are relatively lucky, the newly-installed metal shipping containers.<br></p> <p>The charity has been campaigning for more emergency beds for months, but has faced considerable political hostility. It took Roger three years to find a mayor willing to agree to accommodate a centre for child refugees. With the growing presence of the Front National in the region, there is a wariness of offering more facilities for refugees, even unaccompanied children. <br></p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t treat them as children, but as foreigners and migrants,\u201d Roger said. \u201cThere is also fear that by creating better accommodation there will be a magnet effect, attracting more people.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c77a63f29fe3d299e06e23223c748f84765b5bd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c77a63f29fe3d299e06e23223c748f84765b5bd8/0_70_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man walks past the fence designed to stop migrants and refugees trying to reach Britain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man walks past the fence designed to stop migrants and refugees trying to reach Britain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Rossignol/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said the French authorities had not reacted swiftly enough to the crisis. \u201cSince 2014 the numbers are just going up and up. The 45 spaces we have here no longer corresponds to the reality of the situation in Calais. This system was created in 2009 when there were only 1,500 people in the camp, and perhaps around 100 children,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have never had an ambitious, long-term plan. It is frustrating.\u201d<br></p> <p>A permanent solution to the issue needed to be worked out between Britain and France, he said. \u201cThis is a European problem. We need a joint solution,\u201d he said. The former French president Nicolas Sarkozy visited Calais this week, and said it was not up to France to \u201cbe England\u2019s border guards\u201d.</p> <p>Although the British government made a commitment earlier this year to offer shelter to a share of the <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk/Media-centre/Press-releases/Unaccompanied-refugee-and-migrant-children-in-urgent-need-of-protection-warns-UNICEF/\">95,000</a> estimated unaccompanied refugee children across Europe, with the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/disgrace-to-europe-former-child-refugee-lord-dubs-calais-camp\">Dubs</a> amendment of the Immigration Act, no children have yet been transferred to the UK under this legislation. </p> <p>Those children who do not want to remain in France and continue to attempt to get to the UK, often have strong family connections which make them determined to try to cross the channel to claim asylum in the UK. The boy who died on the road this week, had family in Britain, and consequently a legal right to be reunited with them \u2013 but because the bureaucratic process is so slow, he had given up waiting.<br></p> <p>The Labour MP Stella Creasy launched a new attempt to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/22/call-for-calais-child-refugees-to-be-given-uk-safeguarding-protection\">amend immigration</a> legislation<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/22/call-for-calais-child-refugees-to-be-given-uk-safeguarding-protection\"> </a> on Thursday to force the government to take responsibility for unaccompanied children in Calais. This week the UK\u2019s modern slavery commissioner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/20/uk-delays-calais-children-exploitation-anti-slavery-chief\">Kevin Hyland,</a> criticised the government for its slow response to the crisis. </p> <p>\u201cIt is absolutely unacceptable that these children are left in the camp at the disposal of the criminal networks and they continue risking their lives daily to reach the shores of the UK,\u201d he wrote in a letter to the home secretary, Amber Rudd.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cIf you want to become French, you speak French, you live like the French. We will no longer settle for integration that does not work, we will require assimilation.\u201d These <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/20/nicolas-sarkozy-says-immigrants-should-live-like-the-french/\">were the words of</a> former French president Nicolas Sarkozy this week. He went on: \u201cOnce you become French, your ancestors are the Gauls. \u2018I love France, I learned the history of France, I see myself as French,\u2019 is what you must say.\u201d</p> <p>This week, personalities from both sides of the political spectrum expressed their concern over this statement, made by Sarkozy on Monday night during a meeting in Franconville, a north Paris suburb. Curiously, the part that stirred up most controversy was the idea that, once you become French, the Gauls are your ancestors. This declaration is historically incorrect: Gaul is actually a geographical construct conceptualised by the Romans to refer to a territory bringing people of varied origins together. This notion was later used by the Third Republic, after defeat in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, to rally the French around symbols such as courage and strength.</p> <p>This over-simplification of French roots was removed from the school curriculum in the 1960s in favour of a more inclusive reading of French history after decolonisation, following Max Marchand\u2019s publication of one of the first school textbooks on the history of Algeria.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5148a8e97b9670ab962f9ef2318525e16f57344a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5148a8e97b9670ab962f9ef2318525e16f57344a/0_462_2600_1784/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martinican writer and philosopher Edouard Glissant: \u2018Speaking French is more important than saying something.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martinican writer and philosopher Edouard Glissant: \u2018Speaking French is more important than saying something.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ulf Andersen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sarkozy is only continuing a trend he made popular; after all, he is the president who created the controversial National Identity and Immigration ministry in 2007. Unsurprisingly, the rest of his comments didn\u2019t receive the same criticism. The selective outrage ignores the rehabilitation of the principle of assimilation, setting whiteness as the ideal and erasing people of colour once again. While the majority may think that Sarkozy simply meant that those who move to France must obey the laws of the republic, his comments silence all non-white French people and deny the violence of assimilation. The word \u201cassimilation\u201d itself refers to the second phase of the colonisation process, the first step being \u201cconquest\u201d and the last \u201cpacification\u201d. As Martinican writer and philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/13/edouard-glissant-obituary\">Edouard Glissant</a> said: \u201cSpeaking French is more important than saying something.\u201d Young writer Fanta Sylla comments on that relationship with the French language in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pMlhTknxf4xoSgDyScWT6QoQfN9nTqHamXmfSsLpBg8/mobilebasic\">her essay</a> A Year in France: \u201cWho knew better than the Caribbean, Martinican poets what French colonial occupation and assimilation does to one\u2019s ability to speak and express oneself?

I wouldn\u2019t be able to write without them. I am standing on their shoulders.

It never left completely, but the approaching presidential election seems to have unleashed something. Two weeks ago, it was Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, the ex-prime minister, publicly stating that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poZyJc6IC3E\">colonisation was merely a sharing of culture</a>\u201d. This is historical revisionism, nothing more. What about the rape, murder, forced work, not to mention the \u201cfear, inferiority complex, tremor, kneeling (and) despair\u201d, as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_on_Colonialism\">Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire described.</a> And remember Nadine Morano\u2019s comments last year? The former secretary of state for family <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/01/french-euro-mp-sidelined-after-france-is-a-white-race-remark\">said on television</a> that France was a country of \u201cwhite race\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2016/aug/24/nicolas-sarkozy-is-back-and-hes-more-rightwing-than-ever\">Nicolas Sarkozy is back! And he\u2019s more rightwing than ever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This desperate hunt to reclaim myths and symbols of whiteness wouldn\u2019t be so hurtful if every type of gathering between people of colour wasn\u2019t seen as self-ghettoisation, wouldn\u2019t be so senseless if those of us with layered identities didn\u2019t feel as though we are constantly ordered to somehow shrink ourselves, wouldn\u2019t be so hypocritical coming from a self-proclaimed colourblind country. A \u201crhizome identity\u201d \u2013 one that is forced to grow underground \u2013 is the only way to think outside the binary and nostalgic narrative of French politicians. Glissant <a href=\"http://www.edouardglissant.fr/rhizome.html\">applied this idea</a> to post-structuralists Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari: the image of the rhizome (multiple root in one plant) was used to qualify the plural identity as opposed to the single root identity. In contrast to the model of atavistic cultures, the silhouette of the rhizome places identity in the development of composite cultures through a networking of external inputs.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear, Sarkozy is not the problem. He is not the only one who promotes these notions of enmity. We must remain united against the constant infantilisation of French people, the ban of the critical mind. The only way children of immigrants can fight is to refuse assimilation, to familiarise ourselves with the idea of creolisation and to stop defining ourselves and our worth as a reaction to bigotry.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 23 September 2016 to remove an incorrect reference to Napoleon.</li> </ul>",

  "<p>What most of us remember from our early childhoods are fleeting images that leave faint trails, later to be recaptured by smells or sounds. For Andrew Solomon, there was one extremely vivid early memory, and it formed him. He was in a car, aged about seven, when his Jewish father told him about the Holocaust. The small boy gradually made sense of it, then two thoughts came to him: he decided that he would never allow himself to be \u201chelpless, dependent or credulous\u201d; and that, since the Jews had not escaped their persecutors in time, he would seek safety in leaving \u201cbefore the borders were closed\u201d. Since some Jews had been saved by non-Jewish friends, he would also make it his business to have \u201cbroad affections\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/16/against-the-wall-mexico-calais-division\">Against the wall: from Mexico to Calais, why the idea of division is taking hold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So begins the introduction to <em>Far &amp; Away</em>, a collection of Solomon\u2019s articles, written during almost 30 years of wandering \u2013 he has visited 83 of the world\u2019s 196 countries \u2013 looking, listening, trying to understand. Not for nothing did he subtitle <em>The Reckoning</em>, his book on the shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, \u201csearching for meaning\u201d. That is what Solomon does: he looks for meaning.</p> <p>The idea of a foreign refuge was attractive to the anxious boy, fearful, as he endearingly explains, of everything from scuffles in the school playground to a nuclear attack, and he was fortunate in having a mother who not only loved to travel but insisted on going well prepared. It developed in him a keen curiosity and a profound interest in the nature of travel itself, in \u201cdifference\u201d, and in dealing with strangers. As a reporter, he taught himself to move slowly, take time to get to know the people he met and to look at their worlds without haste or prejudice. \u201cTravel,\u201d he writes, \u201cmakes you modest.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Solomon is an engaging guide \u2013 keen-eyed, self-reflective, shrewd, humane \u2013 and these articles have a pleasing passion</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many of these 30 collected pieces \u2013 for which he provides explanatory notes and updates \u2013 reflect the central concerns of his life: art, mental health, gay rights and countries in momentous times (many appeared first in the New Yorker). Solomon calls himself a \u201cgeneralist, a collector of experiences, and an eccentric one at that\u201d.</p> <p>The article that opens the collection was written for Harpers &amp; Queen in 1988, and is the story of a visit to Moscow to attend the first auction by Sotheby\u2019s of contemporary Russian art, when increasing liberalisation suddenly made popular a number of long-ostracised avant garde artists, bringing them fame and untold money. \u201cThe Winter Palettes\u201d is one of a number of pieces on Soviet art, and later grew into the first of his bestselling, award-winning books, <em>The Irony Tower</em>. Other pieces explore similar territory: South Africa\u2019s art world before the end of apartheid; art in China in the 1990s; and Taiwan\u2019s neglected painters.</p> <p>Fascination with countries at moments of transition, whether crumbling or acquiring new direction, has taken Solomon to Libya, in the closing years of Gaddafi\u2019s reign; to Afghanistan, soon after the fall of the Taliban; to Myanmar, faltering towards democracy; and to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/riodejaneiro\">Rio de Janeiro</a>, when the city was trying to confront organised crime before the 2014 World Cup. He is an engaging guide \u2013 keen-eyed, self-reflective, shrewd, humane \u2013 and these articles have a pleasing passion. Other pieces are lighter \u2013 describing scuba diving off the Barrier Reef, and learning to paint on the coast of Turkey. Solomon is an assiduous collector of facts and an often humorous stylist. In Mongolia, listening to camels at night, he notes that they howl like \u201cthe spirits of purgatory crying out\u201d and that when thirsty their humps \u201cdroop like ageing bosoms\u201d.</p> <p>There is also an enjoyable account \u2013 which featured in his excellent book on depression, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/noonday-demon.html\"><em>The Noonday Demon</em></a> \u2013 of a visit to a shamanistic healer in Senegal, where he was put into bed with a dead ram, covered, while naked, with its blood, tied to a tree with its intestines and spat at by women, before dancing and eating the barbecued ram.

These loosely autobiographical travel pieces, \u201cpsychological studies rather than political ones\u201d, are eloquent proof of how successful he has been at becoming bold. Over the years, Solomon has also come to believe that travel itself may be as important as school attendance and environmental awareness in forming good citizens.

There have been 89 since the May elections and 31 seats have changed hands. Here are the figures.</p> <p><strong>Conservatives:</strong> Net loss of 5 (Gained 5, lost 10)<br></p> <p><strong>Labour: </strong>Net loss of 6 (Gained 4, lost 10)</p> <p><strong>Lib Dems: </strong>Net gain of 14</p> <p><strong>Ukip: </strong>Net loss of 2</p> <p><strong>Greens:</strong> Net gain of 1</p> <p><strong>SNP: </strong>Net loss of 1</p> <p><strong>Prof Tony Travers,</strong> the LSE local government expert, told the programme that the results were \u201cabysmal\u201d for Labour.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The results for Labour are frankly abysmal for the main opposition party at this point of a parliament. The Conservatives, in one way or another, have now been in power for six years. Their results are not that bad. The Lib Dems are making some progress, and in a number of byelections significant progress. But for the main opposition party in England to be losing seats net is pretty bad.</p> </blockquote> <p>Travers also said the Lib Dems were doing very well in some seats.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They are not doing that well in the opinion polls, but they are doing surprisingly well, or certainly surprisingly, compared to the 2015 general election debacle at the local level. Not in every seat, but in a number of seats, and particularly against Labour, it must be said. They are getting swings of 10, 20 even 30% from one party to the other. So I think they can realistically say, although these are straws in the wind, that there are some straws.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if the Lib Dem local council byelection performance provided the basis for a fightback, Travers said it was \u201cthe basis for a basis\u201d. In the past the Lib Dems had won parliamentary seats by building up their strength at council level, he said.

Corbyn has filled the leader\u2019s office with people strongly committed to his brand of politics, but most staff at Labour HQ are not seen as committed Corbynistas.</p> <p>Staff working for the party are represented by GMB and Unite and their convenors, Jim Harvey and Tim Waters, wrote to Corbyn on Monday this week asking him to \u201cpledge your support for unionised Labour Party workers\u201d. Interestingly, they cited Theresa May\u2019s commitment to putting workers on company boards as a reason why Labour staff should be represented on the NEC.</p> <p>Here\u2019s an extract from the letter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is disappointing that while the Tory prime minister has promised worker representation on company boards that Labour Party workers are currently unrepresented on their own executive. It is therefore only right that the Labour party should lead by example and ensure worker representation on the NEC. </p> <p>It would be deeply hypocritical of the party to espouse the importance of staff representation in other organisations and companies and not to act itself to put into practice the demands it places on others.</p> <p>According to the BBC, the Labour staff are demanding two seats on the NEC, in addition to the seat already taken by the party\u2019s general secretary Iain McNicol. </p> </blockquote> <p>In reply <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> said that he was \u201cfully committed to open and transparent consultation with trade unions on all matters relating to members of staff\u201d and that no staff changes were currently being proposed. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As a lifelong and committed trade unionist myself, and as leader of the Labour party, I want to make it absolutely clear that I, and my senior management team, are not supportive of any compulsory redundancies. </p> <p>At this stage, no changes to staff have been proposed and nor would they ever be outside of the context of a properly structured change management programme will full trade union engagement. </p> <p>I would ask that you please disregard any anonymous or unsourced press briefings which suggest otherwise.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e3a759e4b080d3ee88b41c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-22T09:44:09.172Z\">10.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bank of England warns of 'challenging period of uncertainty' after Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>Bank of England</strong> has warned over a \u201cchallenging\u201d outlook for financial stability in the UK as the nation faces \u201cuncertainty and adjustment\u201d following the Brexit vote, the Press Association reports.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC) said that while the financial system has been resilient since the decision to quit the EU, there were concerns over the impact on the UK\u2019s public finances, commercial property and over-indebted borrowers. </p> <p>But it said bank capital standards will not be relaxed following Brexit, telling lenders they could expect rules \u201cat least as great as that currently planned\u201d. </p> <p>The FPC also dashed the prospect of the Help to Buy mortgage scheme being extended, saying its closure as planned at the end of the year would not cause lending to dry up. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2016/033.aspx\">In minutes of the FPC\u2019s meeting earlier this week</a>, it cautioned: \u201cAlthough financial stability has been maintained in the UK through a period of volatility, and a number of economic indicators have picked up from their post-referendum low points, the UK faces a challenging period of uncertainty and adjustment.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e3a437e4b05d653ca5f8b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-22T09:39:24.195Z\">10.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A source in the Owen Smith camp has described John Mann\u2019s claim about Smith plotting a leadership bid at the start of the year as \u201cnonsense\u201d.

Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Mann accuses Owen Smith of running a terrible campaign against Jeremy Corbyn.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Wrong man, wrong time, wrong policies. Owen Smith\u2019s leadership campaigned boiled down to one key message: I am not him. Never has a Labour leadership candidate hit so many bum notes in one campaign. Yet it was so predictable.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mann also claims that Smith was plotting a leadership challenge at the start of the year. \u201cI was approached at the beginning of 2016 by a senior figure promoting his candidature,\u201d Mann writes. This appears to contradict Smith\u2019s claim that he only decided to run against Corbyn when Angela Eagle launched a leadership challenge, although it is possible that Smith was planning a leadership challenge at the start of the year expecting it to happen much later. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/19/corbyn-labour-leadership-says-huge-turnout-at-his-rallies-shows-he-can-win-an-election-politics-live?page=with:block-57dfd77be4b09322c33b7c4a#block-57dfd77be4b09322c33b7c4a\">He told the Guardian recently that Corbyn should have been given longer before being challenged.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>He describes Corbyn as \u201cthe ultimate Westminster insider\u201d and says his real weakness is his \u201cstatism\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The real weakness of Jeremy\u2019s politics is its statism. Jeremy is for the state, preferably run by people like him, doing good things for people. The antidote to this is for a party that embraces the enabling state, where people are empowered to take responsibility themselves and markets are free and open. The mirror opposite of Venezuela in other words.</p> <p>Those whose experience of life is that of the special advisor have never, in their own bubble, succeeded in comprehending this and it lends further credence to Jeremy who can pose as the outsider. However, it\u2019s also Jeremy\u2019s big dilemma, for he knows that he is the ultimate Westminster insider and has been as uncomfortable embracing a real diversity of views and experiences as his opponents have been.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Mann says Labour is out of touch with the working class.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour loves staying inside its comfort zone, battling for irrelevant positions, talking to itself, sympathising with those living in poverty, articulating outrage. But it is terrified of the working class because it might say things they don\u2019t want to hear.</p> </blockquote> <p>A leave supporter, Mann also says he does not accept the claim that most Labour voters backed remain in the EU referendum.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When Jeremy, citing one poll by Lord Ashcroft, wrongly claims that two thirds of Labour voters supported Remain, his supporters and opponents gleefully nod in harmony. Nothing unites Labour more than false comfort about the electorate.</p> <p>Any mathematician can quickly work out that in fact Labour areas were the strongest to vote Leave and any well organised party, sampling ballot boxes, will know that in Labour areas it was the Tory voters who tended to vote Remain and it was large blocks of Labour trade unionists who voted Leave.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He tips Chuka Umunna, Dan Jarvis and Lisa Nandy as potential future leaders.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The next contest will probably be after the next election. Whatever he says now, Jeremy will not stay on if he loses. Only three current MPs have the potential to embrace this wider world. Chuka Umunna, if he can tame his Euro fanaticism; Dan Jarvis, if he can stop acting as a traditional politician; and Lisa Nandy, if she can stay in touch with her constituents.

It then fashions an explanation: that the compromise is based on bad motives. It then develops a theory: that the trajectory of our country has been unchanged by Labour government since the Thatcher years. It then creates a new version of history: there is no difference between Labour and Tory governments. This is the sectarianism that leads to the dead end of permanent opposition.</p> </blockquote> <p>In his article Miliband does not offer a specific programme for what Labour should do to regain power.

The Commons is in recess, and the main political parties are getting ready for their party conferences. Labour\u2019s starts at the weekend and, to mark it, the New Statesman has published a special edition, leading with <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/09/new-times-david-miliband-why-left-needs-move-forward-not-back\">an article by <strong>David Miliband,</strong> the former Labour foreign secretary,</a> despairing at what has happened to his party. Like the Ode to Autumn (which an academic on Today said was partially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/jan/11/isnttoautumnaboutautumn\">influenced by the aftermath of the Peterloo massacre)</a>, Miliband\u2019s article laments loss. But, unlike the Ode, it\u2019s not great poetry, and it\u2019s much more specific.</p> <p>Miliband makes the routine claim (for people from his wing of the party) that Jeremy Corbyn is \u201cunelectable\u201d, but he gives the argument a new twist. Rather than claiming that Corbyn\u2019s policy objectives are fine, but that Corbyn is just the wrong person to be able to implement them (which broadly was Owen Smith\u2019s argument in the leadership contest, with some exceptions), Miliband says that Corbyn has the wrong policies.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The party has ended up pre-New Labour in policy and culture, when we need to be post-New Labour. This year\u2019s leadership election has spent a lot of time debating how to \u201cbring back\u201d various lost icons, such as nationalised railways, rather than focusing on new ideas for the future. </p> <p>The main charge against Jeremy Corbyn is not just that his strategy is undesirable because it makes the party unelectable. That is only half the story. The real issue is that his strategy makes the party unelectable because it is in many aspects undesirable.</p> <p>This is true most egregiously with regard to foreign policy. The half-hearted message about Europe is a betrayal of millions of working people. The equivocation on Nato in the face of Russia\u2019s intimidation of nations in her former sphere of influence is dangerous and throws away progressive values.</p> <p>But the electorate can see through the domestic policy, too. Nationalisation cannot be the answer to everything; anti-austerity speeches cannot explain everything; corporate taxation cannot pay for everything. It doesn\u2019t add up. It wouldn\u2019t work.

  "<h2><strong>Winning tip: Freight car motel, Pennsylvania</strong></h2> <p>Visiting Amish Country on our road trip from Philadelphia to Chicago, we stayed in an old caboose (railroad wagon): the <strong>Red Caboose Motel</strong> in Ronks. The motel consists of a string of old carriages in bucolic countryside. On the farm beside our caboose we watched Amish men in wide-brimmed hats farming with old-fashioned tools; we bought produce from women in bonnets and long dresses, and waved to Amish children peering from buggies.

  "<p>As darkness descends over the imposing green mountains on the outskirts of Mexico City, Luz Reality, a 32-year-old rapper, steps under a faded orange tarp and through a metal security door into the underground venue. Though a veteran of the city\u2019s hip-hop scene, she admits she still gets unnerved by the constant threat of assault in the areas around Ecatepec\u2019s clandestine concert venues.</p> <p>In recent months, this <em>barrio</em> has been plagued by a grisly series of abductions and murders. In one case, a woman was found burned on an empty patch of grass. The victim somehow survived the brutal attack and was still alive when police found her, but died later from her injuries.</p> <p>As is almost always the case in Ecatepec, the murder went unsolved. People here know better than to expect investigations and arrests \u2013 but lately the neighbourhood has been on edge. Frustrated with the violence, residents have banded together to beat and publicly shame alleged criminals on several occasions.</p> <p>Tonight, Luz couldn\u2019t even find a taxi driver willing to drop her off at the venue for her show: an empty Ecatepec lot. She had to walk from the main avenue down desolate streets where kidnappings can happen unnoticed.</p> <p>The neighbourhood has become regarded as Mexico\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/27/mexico-city-plastic-whistles-sexual-assault\">capital of violence against women</a>\u201d. Luz knows the stories about women disappearing, but tries not to let fear limit her life. Since 2012, on average more than one woman has been killed every week in Ecatepec, and last year this violence escalated.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The dynamic is similar to what happened in in the northern border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, just south of the Texas border, in the early 1990s. Earlier this month a Spanish woman was kidnapped from a wealthy area of the city, killed and dumped in a canal in the state of Mexico. Between 2005 and 2015, no fewer than 3,604 women were killed in the state of Mexico, where Ecatepec is located. It\u2019s an alarming trend \u2013 yet each individual murder is just another statistic that barely gets mentioned in the capital\u2019s biggest newspapers.</p> <p>Not formally part of Mexico City, Ecatepec is a residential area that has grown in fits and bursts. A generation of people from the countryside came to settle here in the 1980s and 90s, trying to carve a niche for themselves on the fringe of Mexico\u2019s rapidly transforming, globalised economy.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66360feec6dda01418fd07722231d41d5fcdc263\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66360feec6dda01418fd07722231d41d5fcdc263/123_80_3137_1883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man hangs up a banner showing photographs of missing and dead women in Ecatepec.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man hangs a banner showing photographs of missing and dead women in Ecatepec.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Romero/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The streets surrounding the venue hosting Luz and her friends tonight are a shabby agglomeration of dull-grey cinderblock buildings, most of which were improvised one storey at a time. In contrast, the rappers look like fireworks of fluorescent pink and purple, their gold watches and neon attire shimmering over the sea of cement. </p> <p>With the bass beat thumping, Luz psyches herself up for her performance. She eyes a cadre of teenagers in t-shirts holding plastic cups of beer and Buchanan\u2019s whisky (the local favourite), who form a semi-circle in front of the small, second-storey stage. The crowd is young and riled up. In the back corner, a few scruffy men cut up lines of cocaine on a cell-phone. Inside the cement-block walls, the thumping music creates a warm refuge from the world outside.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was proud of Ecatepec.

[The people] who want to finish me off?\u201d <br></p> <p>In the crowd, a menacing, broad-shouldered man in black clothes and sun-glasses holds up his smart phone to take video, while a group of teenage boys rises from their refuge along the cement wall to watch the performance.<br></p> <p>To the side of the stage, Luz and Alix dance frenetically to the energetic beat, jumping up to rap in unison for the song\u2019s chorus: \u201cI still help my girls in the street; I still help my girls on the stage!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ea03b50d3ef4131f98b766acda6ab9c526ab5f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ea03b50d3ef4131f98b766acda6ab9c526ab5f1/0_0_3100_1860/1000.jpg\" alt=\"High heel shoes are seen in front of a cross outside the Municipal Palace of Ecatepec during a protest against femicides.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">High heel shoes are seen in front of a cross outside the Municipal Palace of Ecatepec during a protest against the murders of women.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even with a few technical difficulties, the show is a welcome respite from what has been a difficult period in Ecatepec. A few weeks earlier, an entire family was dismembered and stuffed into bags in the railyard that runs through the neighbourhood. In another incident, two policemen were killed during their lunch break.</p> <p>For 20 years, though, rap has helped Luz process the world around her. She first heard about it as a teen in the early 1990s. Her friends\u2019 families came from different parts of Mexico, so hip-hop became the common chord that tied them together.</p> <p>****</p> <p>Ecatepec exploded as a byproduct of Mexico\u2019s shift from a corrupt, state-led development strategy based on protectionism and nepotism to the current paradigm of neoliberal economic policy and export promotion. Subsidies that had supported small-time agriculture were dismantled, so poor, rural residents flooded down from the mountains into the valley in Mexico City.</p> <p>As Mexico\u2019s economy dipped into crisis and nearly collapsed, the newcomers found themselves in a precarious position. Families built small shacks using found materials and the neighbourhood expanded up into the hills. In 1995 Mexico\u2019s economy imploded, leaving hundreds of thousands of workers competing for jobs in the informal economy \u2013 hawking sodas at stoplights, selling tacos from carts or working as foot soldiers in Mexico City\u2019s expanding criminal enterprises. As kidnappings surged to unprecedented levels and every day was marked by multiple homicides, it became known as the world\u2019s most dangerous city.</p> <p>In this environment, Luz and her friends learned to navigate the streets, shopping for hip-hop cassettes at open-air markets called <em>tianguis</em> and finding solace in the bravado of early-90s gangster rap. Cypress Hill were Luz\u2019s favourite group; the lyrics helped her take ownership over a difficult environment.</p> <p><em>Where I\u2019m from, the [guns] be smoking / I\u2019ll be damned if you think I\u2019m jokin\u2019 / Know that I\u2019ll come with the static, erratic, .45 automatic</em>. It\u2019s is a Cypress Hill verse that was written about LA, but also reflected the mentality in Ecatepec. Luz was inspired; she started penning her own raps to Cypress Hill beats, but tried to find a way to forge her own version. \u201cWe\u2019re not <em>chicanas</em> [Mexican-Americans],\u201d she explains.</p> <p>As the decades passed, families have replaced cardboard and sheet metal with sturdy cement bricks and added multiple storeys to their homes. In a parallel trend, Mexico City has seen a boom of real-estate investment and a new wave of renovation. Now the city centre is filled with the hulking skeletons of new skyscrapers, and upper-middle class neighbourhoods are enjoying a surge of new construction and rehabilitation.</p> <p>As infrastructure and security have improved, Mexico City has become recognised as a major hub of cultural activity. The New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/07/travel/places-to-visit.html?_r=0\">named the capital</a> as the top place to visit in 2016. </p> <p>The situation on the periphery of the city, however, is less stable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de1087b6eb6d9d35656f26f2dd10525a60d4b4b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de1087b6eb6d9d35656f26f2dd10525a60d4b4b5/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luz Reality stands next to graffiti on the outskirts of Mexico City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luz Reality stands next to graffiti on the outskirts of Mexico City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathaniel Parish Flannery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNow in the parks there are drug addicts, robberies,\u201d Luz explains. \u201cMost people go to Mexico City to work; they don\u2019t work here.\u201d</p> <p> The US Chamber of Commerce in Mexico ranks Ecatepec as the second most challenging security environment for businesses in the country. According to this analysis, the suburb trails only Reynosa, Tamaulipas \u2013 the border city that serves as a base for the notorious Zeta cartel \u2013 in terms of security problems.</p> <p>Ecatepec has evolved since the early 90s, but in many ways it hasn\u2019t improved. \u201cEven though there are malls now, they don\u2019t help. It\u2019s ugly and violent, and is no place to raise kids,\u201d Luz says. <br></p> <p>\u201cI was proud of Ecatepec. [But now,] if I had the chance to leave, I would. I don\u2019t see a future here,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After 7pm you don\u2019t go out. Not in car, walking, or in taxi</p> <footer> <cite>Luz Reality</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A number of multinational companies have built new factories in Ecatepec, but Luz has never worked at any of them. \u201cThe shifts are long and pay is low. To work you have to go to Mexico City or find self-employment selling things at the markets,\u201d she says.<br></p> <p>After she saw a female colleague get kidnapped, Luz left a job teaching kindergarten for a post at a small stationery store near the main plaza. While she has friends who have found jobs in IT and marketing departments in the steel and glass skyscrapers downtown, Luz herself \u2013 like nearly 60% of the women in Ecaptepec \u2013 works in the sprawling, informal economy, in a job that doesn\u2019t include benefits.</p> <p>Ecatepec is now home to 1.6 million people, more than half of whom live below the poverty line. Too many aspects of life here still feel improvised and incomplete. There may police patrols on the wide throughways, but on the side streets security is scarce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f025b4494b85af32953c53c0d830bcc00cd06584\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f025b4494b85af32953c53c0d830bcc00cd06584/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luz pulls on a pair of headphones while recording a rap video in the main plaza in Ecatepec.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luz pulls on a pair of headphones while recording a rap video in the main plaza in Ecatepec.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathaniel Parish Flannery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few weeks after the concert, Luz meets up with bandmates Alix and Maya at a pizza place. The women have broken their self-imposed curfew to have a celebratory dinner to mark the end of a successful day recording a video.</p> <p>In the afternoon, they revel in the activity in the bustling square, rapping to the camera in the golden afternoon light. The plaza brings together old men who have spent decades working in the fields with young parents taking their toddlers to watch the clowns, with teens on BMX bikes and skateboards. As is the case in small towns in the mountains, Ecatepec\u2019s main plaza is the centre of community life: \u201cIt\u2019s representative of Ecaptec\u2019s culture. You\u2019ve got the skaters, the rappers, the B-boys,\u201d Luz explains.</p> <p>As night sets in, Luz and her band-mates bounce in front of big graffiti murals down the street from Luz\u2019s house, using a friend\u2019s car headlights to illuminate the last few shots of the day. With the camera off, the swagger subsides quickly.<br></p> <p>The pizza restaurant\u2019s windows and doors are made of heavy steel bars that look strong enough to stop a truck from crashing through. Although a few people gather at a nearby taco restaurant and a food truck still stands down the road, mostly the streets are empty.</p> <p></p> <p>Luz ties Ecatepec\u2019s hip-hop culture to the <em>cholo</em> culture popularised by Mexican-Americans in early-90s California, Cypress Hill among them. She and the rest of her generation are still wedded to these traditions of DJing, rapping, graffiti art, and breakdancing. </p> <p>But she fears the neighbourhood\u2019s younger generation is more tuned in rapping as a form of aggression \u2013 notably in rap battles \u2013 and, worse, as an ancillary activity to drug dealing. The younger rappers are less interested in painting murals or organising dance competitions and far keener to embrace criminal culture. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ed905213a4b0bcab81c02fe390b17f5bad0ccac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ed905213a4b0bcab81c02fe390b17f5bad0ccac/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A grey graffiti mural in the Ecatepec naighbourhood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A grey graffiti mural in the Ecatepec neighbourhood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathaniel Parish Flannery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Waiting for her pizza to arrive, Luz explains: \u201cWhat I want is young people to know me. I think there are fewer rappers, fewer graffiti artists now.\u201d She sees her neighbourhood\u2019s <em>cholo</em> culture fading away. \u201cIt\u2019s dying,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The hard-edged bravado of the new generation may be more in tune with the current reality of Ecatepec, where drug gangs recruit teens and local mob bosses have turned the neighbourhood into a depot for the retail narco trade. The crime wave has overrun the local police and created a new environment of violence and impunity.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s changed a lot. Before it was safe, now it\u2019s the most dangerous municipality in Mexico state. It\u2019s the worst place in Mexico for <em>femicidios</em>,\u201d Luz explains. On 7 August, the body of a young woman was found near a canal in the nearby town of Zumpango. The victim had been raped and tortured. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of gender-based violence. I think it\u2019s getting worse,\u201d Luz says.<br></p> <p>****</p> <p>The pizza parlour is empty and playing loud <em>banda</em> music, but Alix, usually so exuberant, lowers her voice: \u201cAs a woman, when I have to go to the R\u00edo de los Remedios neighbourhood, I\u2019m scared. I have <em>amigas</em> who live there. They say that girls coming out of the subway there get kidnapped and taken away in cars. They disappear.\u201d</p> <p>The subway stop is next to a highway and few tarp-covered stands selling bootleg CDs. From the stairs that lead down from the train tracks, visitors can see a long expanse of cement buildings and only a few patches of green in the distance.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt takes a lot of risk to go on the road,\u201d says Luz softly. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken a lot of women.\u201d </p> <p>The attacks on women have been well documented by the local tabloids. In December 2015, police discovered the body of a 20-year-old, raped, and beaten to death in an empty lot in Ecatepec. In March, 2016 one of Ecatepec\u2019s own police officers fled town after torturing and killing his own girlfriend.<br></p> <p>Taking a moment to cut and serve slices of pizza, Luz says: \u201cI think it\u2019s worse than ever.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6fa087b3f1a1c8b3aad1cd03b6cd5c5bb7c3cf9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fa087b3f1a1c8b3aad1cd03b6cd5c5bb7c3cf9b/0_43_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An activist wearing rubbish bags and rope, to replicate the way many female murder victims are found, takes part in a protest on the banks of the Remedios River, where corpses regularly wash up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An activist wearing rubbish bags and rope, to replicate the way female murder victims are found, takes part in a protest on the banks of the Remedios River, where corpses often wash up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathaniel Parish Flannery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She lives in a gated community with a guard who watches through a heavy metal gate. Inside, residents have built fences to separate their houses from the street, some girded with razor wire. Outside of her neighbourhood, Luz feels unsafe: \u201cAfter 7pm you don\u2019t go out. Not in car, walking, or in taxi,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can go to the supermarket and the taxi driver will rob you.\u201d</p> <p>Her brother was carjacked right in front of the security post at the entrance to her neighbourhood. \u201cThey put a gun on him and took everything he had, even his gum,\u201d Luz explains.<br></p> <p>But she continues to grind, penning lyrics and recording videos. One of her new songs, I\u2019m Still On My Feet, sums up her attitude. Over a bouncing, bass-driven beat she raps: \u201cAfter everything I\u2019ve been through, I\u2019m still on my feet. I don\u2019t let myself get beaten.\u201d</p> <p>She tries to stay positive but the situation in Ecatepec is heart-breaking: \u201c[Now] it\u2019s worse. There are more<em> femicidios</em> than Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, more kidnappings.\u201d.</p> <p>In some cases, the violence is meted out by partners and ex-partners. In others it\u2019s organised crime, kidnapping women to force them to work in the sex trade.

On the final day of the festival, the young women, or \u201cmaidens\u201d, parade bare-breasted at the royal village. Traditionally, the king is allowed to choose one of the women as a wife, but in recent years the festival has been more about preserving a cultural heritage.</p> <p>However, there is growing criticism from human rights groups who claim cultural ceremonies are enforced in Swaziland by the last absolute monarchy in Africa.</p> <p>\u201cThey say we are not forced, but we are. Families who don\u2019t send their daughters to the <em>Umhlanga</em> have to pay a fine, usually a goat or a cow,\u201d says Nokwanda, 29, a teacher. \u201cWhen I was a young girl, I attended the <em>Umhlanga</em> festival three times. I enjoyed it, but as I became older I wasn\u2019t comfortable with some of the things. </p> <p>\u201cThe girls sleep in small classrooms or tents without proper sanitation. There are also many rules you have to adhere to when you attend the <em>Umhlanga</em>. This is the 21<sup>st</sup> century. We shouldn\u2019t be forced to wear certain clothes.\u201d </p> <p>Swaziland, a small, landlocked country in southern Africa, has a deeply male-dominated society. Polygamy and violence against women is widespread. As a <a href=\"http://www.actsa.org/newsroom/2016/07/womens-rights-in-swaziland-actsa-launches-new-briefing-paper/\">recent report</a> by Action for Southern Africa put it: \u201cWomen continue to suffer discrimination, are treated as inferior to men, and are denied rights.\u201d </p> <p>The country is ruled by King Mswati III, 48, who appoints ministers, chiefs and judges \u2013 and owns most of the land. </p> <p>\u201cWe are tired of him. But we could be victimised if we speak out.

As a parent, I have to send my child in order to secure her future.\u201d</p> <p>She says forcing or bribing young girls to attend the <em>Umhlanga</em> is a violation of their human rights. \u201cChiefs abuse their power and penalise families who don\u2019t take part. The whole idea is for women to show themselves naked in front of the king so that he can choose a wife. It\u2019s very degrading to women. We don\u2019t walk around bare-breasted at home.

They brought probably 10 guns between them, ranging from a revolver to a semi-automatic. We fitted ourselves with earmuffs, and one of the men, who\u2019d built a number of the guns himself and kept a home arsenal of at least 60 firearms, carefully showed me and the boys the safety features of each gun: touch here, never here.

  "<p>According to its editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nikesh-shukla\">Nikesh Shukla</a>, <em>The Good Immigrant</em> is \u201ca document of what it means to be a person of colour\u201d in Britain today. In 21 essays by black, Asian and minority ethnic writers working across literature and the media, the book highlights the standards by which immigrants \u2013 first or second generation, refugees and asylum seekers \u2013 are either accepted into, or judged to be apart from, a dominant culture determined by whiteness.</p> <p>It\u2019s a kind of unspoken deal at the heart of multiculturalism that immigrants are perceived to be \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d. A black or Asian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2016/aug/22/ben-jennings-on-britains-olympic-success-cartoon\">Olympic gold medallist</a> or the winner of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/14/bake-off-winner-nadiya-hussain-racist-abuse-is-part-of-her-everyday-life\">reality TV programme</a> is considered a \u201cgood\u201d immigrant by a host nation wanting sporting success or culinary entertainment. \u201cBad\u201d immigrants are \u201cjob-stealers\u201d or \u201cbenefit-scroungers\u201d or, worse, potential terrorists. Sparked by a disgruntled comment below an interview in the Guardian, Shukla\u2019s crowdfunded editorial project emerged from the \u201cconstant anxiety we feel as people of colour to justify our space, to show that we have earned our place at the table\u201d. Against the unspoken backdrop of post-EU referendum hostility towards \u201cforeigners\u201d, Shukla points to \u201cthe backwards attitude to immigration and refugees, the systemic racism that runs through this country to this day\u201d.</p> <p>The essays interrogate a British national culture trapped in a post-imperial state of nostalgia. There is a strong sense throughout that a white universal experience is a fiction against which black and Asian writers must racialise themselves for a reading audience. Several essays speak to the myths of the Asian \u201cmodel minority\u201d or a \u201cmonolithic blackness\u201d. For Wei Ming Kam, \u201cbeing a model minority is code for being on perpetual probation\u201d as well as denying an individual\u2019s complexity. According to Reni Eddo-Lodge: \u201cIt is up to you to make your own version of blackness in any way you can \u2013 trying on all the different versions, altering them until they fit.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gal-dem.com/author/varaidzo/\">Varaidzo</a>, editor at the online magazine gal-dem, writes: \u201cThere is no one way to be black. Our worst performance is entertaining the idea that there is.\u201d As well as anatomising subtle and not-so-subtle forms of racism,<em> The Good Immigrant</em> engages at various points with the identity politics of language, authenticity and cultural appropriation: even \u2013 controversially no doubt \u2013 white practitioners of yoga repeating \u201com\u201d and \u201cnamaste\u201d while understanding little of their meanings.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.chimenesuleyman.com/\">Chimene Suleyman</a> movingly traces the origins of names \u2013 her own, her family\u2019s \u2013 across linguistic and political borders from Cyprus to the UK. \u201cWords, names, and their noises are careless in England. They are not put to use in the way that obstructed communities have learned to pronounce every violence put upon us as though it is sacred. We carry our trauma in every word that we say.\u201d As Suleyman rightly suggests, \u201cstandardisation is the backbone of empire\u201d.</p> <p>The legacy of imperialism, including its racial hierarchies, is deep; with the current approval rating of the British empire at 43%, this seems unlikely to change. Suleyman identifies British cultural deafness to historical violence: \u201cIt is there in the white men and women who do not understand, to the point of frustration, why we still walk with the noose of our ancestors around our necks, as we cannot comprehend how they do not carry the indignity of their ancestors tying it there.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/15/riz-ahmed-typecast-as-a-terrorist\">Typecast as a terrorist | Riz Ahmed | The Long Read</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Along with Suleyman\u2019s essay, Riz Ahmed\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/15/riz-ahmed-typecast-as-a-terrorist\">\u201cAirports and Auditions\u201d</a> is a standout piece.

Oslo has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/19/oslo-moves-to-ban-cars-from-city-centre-within-four-years\">revealed plans</a> to ban all private vehicles from the centre by 2019, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/hamburg-answer-to-climate-change\">Hamburg</a> is developing a <a href=\"http://www.hamburg.de/gruenes-netz/\">green network</a> for people on foot and bikes that will span 40% of the metropolis, and Madrid intends to pedestrianise the urban core and expel cars by 2020.<br></p> <p>So is London being left behind? The London Cycling Campaign said it would welcome a car-free day in London, but that it would be no match for long-term investment in infrastructure.</p> <p>\u201cThe LCC would love to see car free days in London,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe know many people want to cycle in our city, but currently feel scared because of the danger posed by heavy motor traffic. Car-free days would open up our streets so that more Londoners could enjoy the spaces where they live, work and play; and travel around the city by bike without fear.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, car-free days wouldn\u2019t reduce the actual dangers that cyclists and pedestrians face day to day. London needs long-term investment in cycling and high-quality cycling infrastructure to make our streets safe for everyday journeys by bike and on foot, for people of all ages and abilities.\u201d</p> <p><em>Thursday 22 September is World Car-Free Day.

  "<p>The Liberal party\u2019s campaign director, Tony Nutt, has defended the government\u2019s decision not to go negative against Bill Shorten and Labor in the 2016 election, arguing it would have driven voters to support non-major party candidates.<br></p> <p>In a message largely targeted for internal consumption, Nutt told the National Press Club the Liberal campaign was not \u201cundermined by being positive\u201d \u2013 which is a view some government MPs hold \u2013 and argued the broadly positive messaging helped deliver the government a narrow victory.</p> <p>Nutt, who on Thursday delivered the traditional campaign wash-up, said the opposition leader was already \u201ca net negative for Labor and so the job of the campaign, with limited resources, was not to tell people something they already knew and thought\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/22/turnbull-tells-un-secure-borders-essential-for-managing-global-migration-flow\">Turnbull tells UN secure borders essential for managing global migration flow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nutt\u2019s analysis about the key strategic calls in the lead-up to and during the eight-week poll are his first public commentary on the recent campaign, which has, thus far, largely been defined by internal critics who have complained of dysfunction in national headquarters, poor messaging and a lack of functional field resources.</p> <p>Nutt also declared Labor\u2019s Medicare privatisation assault on the government a \u201ccold-blooded lie\u201d \u2013 borrowing a phrase from American Democrat Harrold Ickes.</p> <p>Nutt became visibly emotional when recounting Labor\u2019s targeting of \u201chighly vulnerable people\u201d during the campaign, like his elderly relatives, and he called on the ALP to \u201cpledge never again to behave in that way\u201d.</p> <p>But Nutt was presented with a range of scenarios where the Liberal party had campaigned on highly misleading statements such as Labor\u2019s carbon price leading to $100 lamb roasts, the alleged wiping out of Whyalla courtesy of carbon pricing and the oft-repeated \u201cbudget emergency\u201d that featured heavily in the 2013 election campaign.</p> <p>The Liberal party director attempted to draw a distinction between rhetorical arguments made during policy debates \u2013 \u201ccontestable public policy phrases\u201d \u2013 and the Medicare privatisation, which he said was never going to happen.</p> <p>\u201cLast time I looked, during Labor\u2019s period in office, they had a carbon tax and, last time I looked, Tony Abbott won the 2013 election in part dealing with that issue and the tax was repealed. So there actually was a tax,\u201d Nutt said.</p> <p>\u201cNow you can debate a particular point about legs of pork or something, fair point. But there actually was a tax and it actually was repealed. What we\u2019re talking about here is a cold-blooded lie.</p> <p>\u201cNobody in this room or watching television today thinks that Medicare was going to be privatised, could be privatised or will ever be privatised.\u201d</p> <p>Nutt also stood by the campaign messaging deployed controversially by the LNP backbencher George Christensen, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/11/mp-george-christensen-assured-no-syrian-refugees-to-be-settled-in-mackay\">said Syrian refugees should not settle in his north Queensland community.</a> \u201cI suspect that Mr Christensen\u2019s campaign reflects his public policy views on a range of issues,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/22/muslim-immigration-poll-result-due-to-poor-leadership-says-tanya-plibersek\">Muslim immigration poll result due to poor leadership, says Tanya Plibersek</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He also denied the Liberal party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/24/julie-bishop-steps-up-attack-on-anne-aly-in-hate-preacher-row\">had attempted to smear</a> the then Labor candidate for Cowan, the deradicalisation expert Anne Aly, during the campaign, despite the fact West Australian ministers including Michael Keenan and Julie Bishop contended she did not support the government\u2019s national security efforts and tried to secure reduced jail time for a \u201chate preacher\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t accept that anyone was smeared,\u201d Nutt said.</p> <p>Nutt said he took ultimate responsibility for key calls during the campaign and said he would contribute constructively to a campaign review now under way.</p> <p>He used the speech to paint a picture about the government\u2019s fortunes in the lead up to the election being called in budget week, 2016.</p> <p>Nutt said that, after Abbott\u2019s election in 2013, \u201ca number of important objectives were achieved\u201d but he noted that \u201ca number of political difficulties\u201d presented themselves in 2014-15, which led to the \u201cre-formation\u201d of the government with Malcolm Turnbull at the helm.</p> <p>Nutt said Turnbull\u2019s ascension improved the government\u2019s fortunes \u201cbut community expectations of quick solutions to difficult issues reached unrealistic levels.\u201d</p> <p>He said the GST debate, which Turnbull took on in the latter part of 2015 and the early part of 2016, had to be prosecuted but, \u201cas the government worked its way through a cacophony of demands and high expectations\u201d, the community became unsettled.</p> <p>Nutt said the government had to demonstrate it had a positive agenda through the handing down of the budget and campaign on that, rather than focus extensively on the deficiencies of opponents.</p> <p>\u201cSimply reciting the past sins of Labor and the Greens or drawing attention to the undesirable aspects of a possible Labor/Greens minority government would not be a sufficient or workable strategy unless the government met voter\u2019s expectations about itself,\u201d Nutt said.</p> <p>\u201cOtherwise the vote would be splintered and recycled by independent and minor parties to the detriment of the Coalition.\u201d</p> <p>Nutt was asked about whether foreign donations should be banned and he said future reform on campaign finance needed to be approached cautiously because the area was complex and \u201cbecause sometimes, in campaign finance reform, it\u2019s outrage in search of evidence\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/sep/22/christian-porters-welfare-figures-are-designed-to-shock-pay-them-no-respect\">Christian Porter's welfare figures are designed to shock.

And we need to do more to get those resources, to have those structures and have those capacities.\u201d</p> <p>He also said business groups would need to step up their campaigning capacity to offset the influence of trade unions and progressive activists.</p> <p>After the speech, Tony Abbott\u2019s former chief of staff, Peta Credlin, told Sky News the speech was an assessment you\u2019d give \u201cabout a devastating loss when it wasn\u2019t your campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Credlin said it was hard to pin the result on Nutt when all the strategic calls were made by Malcolm Turnbull, and she suggested Turnbull was comprehensively outgunned by Shorten and Labor\u2019s ground operation, particularly in New South Wales, which she characterised as \u201cquite exceptional.\u201d</p> <p>She said the speech Nutt couldn\u2019t give on Thursday was the speech assigning blame to Turnbull. \u201cThe leader\u2019s got to have ticker, the leader has got to know exactly who they are and what they stand for, they\u2019ve got to have conviction, and I think that was sorely lacking in the campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Credlin queried Nutt\u2019s rationale that a negative campaign would not have worked. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve lost 14 seats and three Senate positions, it might have worked, it might have got you a better result. You won with a one seat majority \u2013 come on \u2013 I would have had a crack at some of those things.\u201d</p> <p>She said no-one in the 2016 campaign sort advice from people she characterised as \u201cold hands\u201d \u2013 meaning either herself or her husband, Brian Loughnane, a former director of the Liberal party. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a call, and I doubt Brian got many calls either.

  "<p>Qurghonteppa was at the very edge of the Soviet Union, a dusty city in the baking plains of what is now southern Tajikistan, not far from the Afghan border. It is not, at first glance, the kind of place you would expect to find an English library with 30,000 books, everything from bedtime stories to illustrated guides to the gardens of England.</p> <p>The books were transported wholesale from Kent, after a library in the area closed down a decade ago. They are part of Sworde Teppa, an English-language project designed to help give young Tajiks more opportunities in life. </p> <p>Paul Marchant, 50, from Tonbridge, who runs Sworde Teppa, said: \u201cI heard that Kent county council were disposing of about 30,000 books, and so I did loads of trips in my dad\u2019s car to pick them up and had them shipped to Tajikistan in two containers.\u201d</p> <p>Marchant is an entomologist who first came to Tajikistan in 1999 to research a project on the efficacy of mosquito nets. Initially, he started Sworde Teppa as an environmental organisation to help promote sustainable living. English lessons emerged as a sideline when it became clear that young people in Tajikistan had little option but to live in poverty at home or travel to Russia for low-paid, unskilled labour. </p> <p>Gradually, English lessons became the organisation\u2019s main activity. More than 3,000 students have passed through the school over the past decade. A month of English classes at Sworde Teppa costs 80 somoni (\u00a38), but almost half the students are eligible for free lessons. Groups of disabled children and orphans study free, and the school offers free classes for English teachers employed in state schools and universities to help improve their language skills.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f793699c28676e196585777f2406ee9cd637f1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f793699c28676e196585777f2406ee9cd637f1a/0_61_4320_2819/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A class at the Sworde Teppa school in Tajikistan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A class at Sworde Teppa school, where a month of English lessons costs about \u00a38, but almost half the students can study free.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sworde Teppa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shahnoza Davlatzoda, 24, spent four years studying English at Sworde Teppa, which allowed her to apply for a business degree at the Kazakh-American University in Almaty, Kazakhstan.

After 17 years in the country, he speaks hardly a word of Tajik and runs the school from an office adorned with portraits of various royals, and bunting depicting a smiling Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. One room is filled with butterflies and insects he has captured, as well as pickled snakes in jars and stuffed animals. </p> <p>But Marchant\u2019s life is far from luxurious: he has given everything to ensure the school stays open. Marchant has not travelled to Britain for nearly a decade due to an absence of funds and does not often visit Tajikistan\u2019s capital, Dushanbe. \u201cSome of the teachers haven\u2019t been paid for two months. It wouldn\u2019t be right for me to be dashing off on trips. If I had the money, I would use it to pay them,\u201d he said. He has spent all his savings on the school and subsists on a basic diet.</p> <p>The school is required to pay business taxes, even though it is a non-profit organisation, and in 2016 it received just one donation of about $100 from an academic based abroad.

  "<p>Italy\u2019s best-kept food secret is the <em tabindex=\"-1\">sagra</em>. A festival organised to show off a local food or drink (or both), a sagra is a place where you\u2019ll eat well \u2013 and learn.

And they\u2019re not just about the food: many sagre have their roots in old country fairs or pagan festivals celebrating the harvest and have been running for decades, even centuries.

More than two years ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/29/labour-abolish-electoral-college-alan-johnson\" title=\"\">Labour abolished the electoral college</a>, replacing it with one member one vote and a supporters\u2019 scheme so that anyone could join up and instantly have a vote. Ed Miliband\u2019s leadership implemented these proposals at the behest of the party\u2019s right. By moving towards US-style primaries, they believed, Labour would be freed from the grip of the trade union movement, and people sharing the right\u2019s worldview would pour into the party, permanently shifting Labour\u2019s political centre of gravity.</p> <p>One snag: the Labour right lacked any compelling, coherent narrative to inspire anyone. People poured into the party all right, but their belief system could hardly have been more undesirable from the standpoint of the party\u2019s right.

What unites its foot soldiers is a rejection of a political consensus that they believe brought disaster in Iraq, financial collapse, unnecessary and ideologically driven cuts and policies that have disproportionately hammered the young. Many are strikingly aware of Corbyn\u2019s flaws and limitations, but they fear his fall will lead to a restoration of the old order and the systematic removal of the left. Since Corbyn\u2019s election, they feel that not only has their chosen leader been smeared by the press, but that they themselves have been subjected to campaign of vilification.</p> <p>They believe MPs plotted to undermine their preferred leader before he was even elected, that they undermined him through his tenure in office and plunged the party into an unnecessary and destructive leadership contest at a time of national crisis. They are infuriated by bureaucratic manoeuvres they believe were designed to block Corbyn\u2019s re-election, like an attempt to keep him off the ballot and a heavyhanded purge of the leader\u2019s supporters.</p> <p>The fury that has resulted may be understandable, but it will prove fatal if unchecked. The onslaught against the movement could yet destroy it, precisely because of the anger it has provoked. Talk of war and mass deselections will resonate with many Corbyn supporters and be affirmed with applause. Some may theatrically boo prominent members of the Labour family who oppose Corbyn. Hunts for witches and renegades, stirred up by pitchfork-holding Twitter accounts, may be instigated.

Today no one of any significance is calling for the nationalisation of the top 200 monopolies, for instance. Yes, Corbyn supports unilateral disarmament, but in the 80s it was a key article of faith for Labour\u2019s left. From selection in&#xa0;education to the NHS to the economy&#xa0;and tax, there is actually striking agreement among MPs,&#xa0;members and unions. Owen Smith&#xa0;ran on a similar domestic platform to Corbyn, underscoring that unity. Issues that unite should be emphasised and built on, rather than differences emphasised for show.</p> <p>If politics consumes a huge portion of your life \u2013 as it does mine \u2013 then it can be easy to forget just how little enthusiasm most people have about it. Coups, purges, Labour\u2019s NEC, memes about the rival candidates pepper my social media timelines every day. Most people have spent the last three months slogging away at their job, going to the seaside, having after-work drinks, picking their kids up after school \u2013 getting on with their lives. Let\u2019s be blunt. If members of the public are even paying attention to Labour\u2019s car crash \u2013 and most have switched channel \u2013 \u201cfreakshow\u201d is probably one of their kinder words.</p> <p>The movement must now refocus all its attention on them. These are people who agree with them on many issues \u2013 higher taxes on the rich, publicly owned utilities, more workers\u2019 rights \u2013 but also have often dramatically different attitudes when it comes to immigration and social security. A movement that wants to succeed must be restless in its determination to engage a public that simply does not share its passion.</p> <p>Corbyn has posed by an olive tree to demonstrate his sincerity in reaching out. In doing so, he\u2019s setting an example his followers must surely follow. The movement behind Corbyn brims with energy and has so much potential. It could spend the next few months stirred up by angry witch-finders while the Tories implement an agenda Margaret Thatcher would have balked at.

In groups, we were ushered through four stories of Sydney\u2019s World Bar, which has been transported back to its old identity as the infamous Nevada brothel. Like an indulged, reminiscing relative, the venue is bursting with stories from the area\u2019s grittier past. </p> <p>It\u2019s an easy journey with easy humour \u2013 a quick trip through Les Girls; the shady murder of activist Juanita Nielsen; and a close encounter with Kings Cross personality Bea Miles (she warns us that corruption comes along with gentrification). Finally to a singalong at the recreated Silver Spade lounge, featuring Rob \u201cMillsy\u201d Mills and a couple of crooners from the Great American Songbook. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b83977cbb3578cfa412cec12130e3e7afa72f3a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b83977cbb3578cfa412cec12130e3e7afa72f3a5/0_0_2400_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018An easy journey with easy humour\u2019: a scene from Hidden Sydney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018An easy journey with easy humour\u2019: a scene from Hidden Sydney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie Williams/Only for use in 22 September wrap-up of Art &amp; About</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The night is broad and camp and asks for a little good-natured audience interaction as it casts Sydney\u2019s past in a fond, if chiding light. Hidden Sydney wants to tell us that the city has finally put away its childish things and moved to an era of less crime, sensible bedtimes and safer sex. But it allows a moment for us to track what\u2019s been lost \u2013 the infinite possibility of late night or a connecting thread for communities who identify a little differently and want to celebrate, not lose that. And the sense of a city\u2019s indefinable, personal magic. </p> <p>It might be a cautionary tale, but as the Cross closes down and lockout laws limit the city\u2019s social side, it\u2019s hard not to feel a great loss in Hidden Sydney. Is there anything hidden about Sydney anymore? Any surprises waiting for us under something that strives to be more homogenised? Is there enough sparkle left in the glittering mile that once was Kings Cross?</p> <h2>The present: Australian Life</h2> <p>Hyde Park is host to Art &amp; About\u2019s two other works: curated photography exhibits in the heart of the city that want to reflect who we are now and what we care about. </p> <p>Under a canopy of twinkling lights Australian Life has its eye fixed firmly on the Sydney of the present and its split personalities: the Sydney of things, and the Sydney of people. It\u2019s a show about identity that reaches occasionally beyond Sydney into greater Australia. The walk takes us inward and asks: what do we value?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"222c8f9cd3f30022a4b98224a4962c16d2acb89c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/222c8f9cd3f30022a4b98224a4962c16d2acb89c/0_0_2700_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heaven by Nikki McLennan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heaven by Nikki McLennan, part of Australian Lives exhibition at Art &amp; About Sydney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nikki McLennan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s the excess of a one year old\u2019s birthday party (Nikki McLennan), the frame heaving with food.

There\u2019s no luxury of enjoyment and there\u2019s no real joy. The pleasure and excess of the Cross and the wider city is all but lost here to work and tradition.

The sheriff\u2019s office will be deployed to people\u2019s homes and tell you that you are being issued a summons to come down and establish your voting eligibility.\u201d<br><br>Clarke added: \u201cWe filed just last week in Georgia where the secretary of state\u2019s office has failed to process more than 42,000 registration forms from people who want to vote because of a restrictive practice that requires that every letter, every digit, every character on a registration form exactly match information contained in the state\u2019s database. And we know those databases are riddled with errors and this is a practice that disadvantages African Americans and minority voters in particular.\u201d</p> <p>In 2013, the supreme<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2013/jun/25/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-live#block-51c9bd00e4b010aecdc44f5d\"> court struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act in a 5-4 ruling in Shelby County, Alabama v.

Congress has so far failed to do so; activists blamed Republican leaders for inaction.</p> <p>Clarke noted that Wednesday\u2019s panel discussion was taking part in the Lyndon Johnson room, named after the president who signed voting rights into law. She warned: \u201cWhat I can tell you is this: the world has changed in the absence of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Officials at the state and the local level have exploited every opportunity they can to institute or maintain discriminatory voting practices in the absence of section 5. <br></p> <p>\u201cEach day that Congress fails to act, we not only subject African Americans and other minority voters to the recurring indignity of voter discrimination but taxpayers suffer too. North Carolina has spent nearly $5m defending its discriminatory voter suppression law; Texas has spent more than $3.5m defending its discriminatory voter ID law. And the price tag increases each day.<br><br>\u201cVoter discrimination, if left unchecked, will stand as a stain on our democracy. It is bad for taxpayers, it is bad for Americans. It is time for Congress to stop turning a blind eye to the resurgence of voter discrimination in our country.\u201d</p> <p>Recent restrictions passed by 14 states include new photo ID requirements, a reduction in early voting days and the abolition of same-day registration. Voter fraud is often cited as a reason but experts said the problem is \u201cminuscule\u201d.</p> <p>Civil rights stalwart John Lewis, a Democratic Representative from Georgia, was in the room when Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act. But he said during this year\u2019s primaries he came across a couple who had been married for 40 but were told to vote at separate polling stations.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn the past few months and years I\u2019ve traveled across the country and I know that there is a deliberate persistent systematic effort to make it harder and more difficult for the disabled, student, senior, minority, the poor and rural voters to participate in the democratic process. That\u2019s not right, not fair, and it\u2019s not just.\u201d<br></p> <p>He said it was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d that Congress has not acted and call on Clarke\u2019s organisation to \u201cfile suits all over the place to make it real, make it plain\u201d.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e2f99fe4b011f2eb711e58\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-21T21:20:57.659Z\">10.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ted Cruz appears pleased with Donald Trump\u2019s embrace of a discredited conspiracy theory that the United States is turning over \u201ccontrol\u201d of the Internet to the United Nations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/778704296791543810\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Appreciate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a>\u2019s support of our efforts to keep the internet free: <a href=\"https://t.co/gc4aRustpx\">https://t.co/gc4aRustpx</a></p>&mdash; Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/778704296791543810\">September 21, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e2f525e4b05d653ca5f63b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-21T21:06:19.092Z\">10.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">New national poll: Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 7 points in two-way race</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>According to the latest national poll released by NBC/the Wall Street Journal, former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican nominee Donald Trump by 7 points nationally, 48% to 41%, a,d leads by 6 points in a four-way race, 43% to Trump\u2019s 37%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99b0944794e9d8e85c2d9396d2e8e67d9ca8c468\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99b0944794e9d8e85c2d9396d2e8e67d9ca8c468/0_0_2000_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson has broken the double digits with 10% support, while Green nominee Jill Stein holds at 3%.</p> <p>Clinton heads into the first presidential debate this coming Monday with only slightly weakened margins since the last time the poll was conducted, and with an increase in her (still dismal) favorability ratings.
