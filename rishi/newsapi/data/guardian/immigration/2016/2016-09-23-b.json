Obama cited the potential for the popular bipartisan bill to backfire against the US, its diplomats and military personnel. The bill sailed through both chambers of Congress by voice vote, with final House passage coming just two days before Obama led the country in marking the 15th anniversary of the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on 11 September 2001.</li> <li>Billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson plans to donate as much as $25m to a Super Pac supporting Donald Trump \u2013 more than five times what he had been expected to contribute.

He writes on his site The Insurgent, <a href=\"http://theresurgent.com/evan-mcmullin-a-sane-alternative/\">calling McMullin the \u201csane alternative\u201d</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The reality is Evan McMullin\u2019s candidacy is a long shot. His best shot is winning a few states to throw the race to the House of Representatives where, though he may not get the Presidency, he might ensure neither Trump nor Hillary get it. To do this he would have to win a few blue states, which though difficult is not impossible. Surprisingly, he is already beginning to register in polls in red states like Utah and purple states like Virginia.</p> <p>Frankly, Evan McMullin may actually serve a more important role in 2016. Though he may not win, he might at least provide disaffected conservatives an excuse to show up and vote down ballot. Saving the Senate and House of Representatives from the Democrats has to be a priority for conservatives, but many are so disgusted by 2016 that they will not even show up in November.</p> <p>McMullin gives people a reason to show up. He gives conservatives someone they can vote for without holding their nose. He gives people someone to vote for instead of reconciling themselves to voting against someone. McMullin\u2019s candidacy is not the lesser of an evil, but an alternative against evil. For many, that will be enough.</p> <p>A lot of people have been writing me, begging me to reconsider Donald Trump. They think this is the last best chance to get this nation right. They think we will turn a corner after which we cannot turn back. In truth, I have concluded we are already past the point of redemption when the best either party can do is offer up Clinton or Trump. We are beyond the point of looking to five black robed masters to save us from ourselves when we put up either a Clinton or a Trump. The seriousness and virtue of the voter is in the grave already and too many yearn for an idolized past that never existed in a future that is not theirs, but God\u2019s, to shape.</p> <p>I am realistic that Evan McMullin has a limited change of winning. But I am idealistic enough to hope for better than Clinton or Trump.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e56cf1e4b0831a51401a9f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-23T18:08:54.763Z\">7.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More rumors are swirling around that Ted Cruz will shortly endorse Donald Trump for president, with <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-rival-cruz-to-throw-support-to-gop-nominee-228584\">Politico reporting</a> that \u201cmultiple sources close to Cruz\u201d say it is coming as early as today.</p> <p>Cruz and Trump had a particularly brutal primary fight, with Trump insinuating that Cruz\u2019s father was involved in the assassination of John F Kennedy and that his wife was unattractive.</p> <p>As Politico reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is unclear whether Cruz will say only that he is voting for the Republican nominee, as other lawmakers have done, or offer a more full-throated endorsement, but the idea of throwing any support to Trump is controversial within Cruzworld.</p> <p>\u201cIf he announces he endorses, it destroys his political brand,\u201d said someone who had worked for Cruz\u2019s campaign.</p> </blockquote> <p>A former Cruz backer, conservative radio host Steve Deace, is tweeting his disappointment at news that the Texas Senator may back the party\u2019s controversial nominee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779367746874269696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I hope I&#39;m wrong, but I think a man I admire will today make the worst political miscalculation I&#39;ve ever witnessed.</p>&mdash; Steve Deace (@SteveDeaceShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779367746874269696\">September 23, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779374466191196161\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I really hope the Cruz advisers that pressured him for months to do this know their base as well as they seem to think they do.</p>&mdash; Steve Deace (@SteveDeaceShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779374466191196161\">September 23, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779369211860815872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People may love Cruz endorsing Trump.

Its challenge, say Clinton campaign advisers, is to match and thwart the way terrorism has transitioned from large-scale attacks directed by established terrorist groups to small-scale assaults by unconnected, self-radicalized perpetrators that are comparatively difficult to detect.</p> <p>Overseas, the Clinton campaign discusses the intelligence surge in terms of accelerating a focus on the Middle East.</p> <p>It seeks to expand intelligence sharing, particularly across European governments hindered by the lack of a continental intelligence infrastructure, concerning flows of jihadists, money and weapons.</p> <p>And it will support an intensified hunt for Baghdadi expending \u201csignificant resources\u201d, reminiscent of Barack Obama\u2019s successful push to find and kill al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>\u201cShe really would put a concerted focus on that, really going after him in particular,\u201d said Laura Rosenberger, a senior Clinton foreign policy adviser and former state department and National Security Council official.</p> <p>Read the rest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/hillary-clinton-national-security-plan-isis-baghdadi\">here</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/hillary-clinton-national-security-plan-isis-baghdadi\">Hillary Clinton's plan to stop Isis: hunt down leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e507cae4b0f91912fb0446\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-23T12:35:51.099Z\">1.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. </p> <h2>Humbling at Hofstra?</h2> <p>Preparation for Monday\u2019s first presidential debate at Hofstra University in New York means a fairly quiet Friday, with no official events planned for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>Instead, it\u2019s debate prep day.</p> <p>For Clinton that means less mock debate and more conversations about how to handle the different forms of possible Trump attacks, with the motto of prepare, prepare, prepare, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/hillary-clinton-debate-prep-228558\">says Politico</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the end, it might not be anything Clinton says that matters. Many longtime aides credited the power of her reaction shot \u2013 a comically disapproving maternal glare honed from her years as a first lady enduring another long spiel by somebody else \u2013 as one of her most valuable weapons in communicating gravitas and strength in the face of Trump\u2019s expected insults.</p> </blockquote> <p>Trump\u2019s technique is often to question the validity of the moderators and the event itself, say <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-presidential-debates/clinton-trump-take-different-approaches-first-debate-prep-n652726?cid=sm_tw\">campaign reporters from NBC News</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The GOP nominee has been fond of describing himself as a \u201ccounter-puncher,\u201d but Trump\u2019s debate strategy during the primary seemed simply to keep punching at rivals while reiterating portions of his stump speech. He sparred with nearly every Republican who he shared the stage with throughout the GOP primary process and mostly stayed away from specific policies in lieu of rhetorical red meat for his supporters. And he was generous with his use of nicknames for his opponents: \u201clow energy\u201d Jeb Bush, \u201clyin\u2019 Ted\u201d Cruz and \u201cliddle Marco\u201d Rubio.\u2019</p> </blockquote> <p>The debate is a hot ticket.

But that\u2019s not the chief reason to vote for her. She deserves America\u2019s support because she is the overwhelmingly better candidate. Against a Romney or a McCain, she would almost certainly be our choice. Against Trump? The question answers itself.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Clinton\u2019s new ad: Trump insults women</h2> <p>The Clinton campaign released a new video today, similar to the \u201crole models\u201d ad where children watched TV while Donald Trump\u2019s most heinous comments play. But today\u2019s focus is on females, playing a collection of Trump\u2019s worst quotes about a women\u2019s physical appearance over footage of young women looking at themselves in the mirror.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHGPbl-werw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vHGPbl-werw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cDoes she have a good body?

  "<p>In the old courthouse in Geelong, 75km south-west of Melbourne, the Back to Back theatre troupe is rehearsing their new play, <a href=\"https://www.festival.melbourne/2016/events/lady-eats-apple/#.V95NGWWkjq0\">Lady Eats Apple</a>. Mark Deans begins the read-through of act three. \u201cBlue car,\u201d he says and, as per the script, is upbraided that \u2013 being a man with Down syndrome \u2013 he has never driven a car.</p> <p>Lady Eats Apple will take the audience from a creation story into the contemporary realm when it is staged at the Melbourne festival next month, and next year at Sydney\u2019s Carriageworks. Most of the actors would be perceived by the general community to have an intellectual disability. They write the scripts in part by drawing on improvisations based on their own lives; the story also explores euthanasia and gods destroyed by their own success. </p> <p>Back to Back\u2019s earlier play, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/10/ganesh-versus-the-third-reich-review-edinburgh-festival-2014\">Ganesh versus the Third Reich</a>, dealt with Nazism and eugenics; first performed in 2012, it won a <a href=\"http://www.helpmannawards.com.au/2012/past-nominees-and-winners/theatre\">Helpmann award</a> for best play and toured internationally, including in the United Kingdom. Yet some argue Australia has overall been lagging behind the UK\u2019s broader commitment to disability-led performing arts projects.</p> <p>Continuing the rehearsal, Simon Laherty and Sarah Mainwaring put on white overalls, on which script is handwritten in two marker colours. Each actor unfolds creases in the other\u2019s clothing, to see their intimate text, but also as intentional tactile gestures. \u201cI so want to touch you,\u201d reads Laherty. \u201cI want to kiss you on the mouth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to have a coffee, kiss and all that stuff,\u201d responds Mainwaring. \u201cWhen I\u2019m sick, you can look after me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"35c3eec5f91022a656b84aa349253dd56e13116a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35c3eec5f91022a656b84aa349253dd56e13116a/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Mainwaring, left, and Simon Laherty peer into the world in Back to Back Theatre company\u2019s Lady Eats Apple\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Mainwaring, left, and Simon Laherty peer into the world in Back to Back Theatre company\u2019s Lady Eats Apple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Busby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back to Back artistic director <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARlqZ4tuOpM\">Bruce Gladwin</a> has overseen the ground-breaking company since 1999; in 2012, he told me \u201c<a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/theatre/fear-keeps-roles-from-lauded-disabled-actors-20121205-2avll.html\">fear of the unknown</a>\u201d kept many actors with perceived disabilities from being cast in theatre, film and television. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/artsaccessaust\">Arts Access Australia</a> had then just launched its <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/rampup/articles/2012/08/20/3573675.htm\">Don\u2019t Play Us, Pay Us</a> campaign to get more such actors cast. </p> <p>Four years later, progress is slow with \u201cauthentic casting\u201d.

How do the Back to Back actors feel about the world \u201cdisability\u201d? Sarah Mainwaring speaks slowly because of a palsy: \u201cAs a performer and writer I accept that word, but I don\u2019t let it stop me.\u201d</p> <p>Simon Laherty explains that the scene in which he and Mainwaring are reading from one another\u2019s clothing is about anyone being allowed to find love: \u201cA person can\u2019t tell you how to run your life,\u201d he says, zeroing in on the key issue of individual autonomy. \u201cYou can make your own choices.\u201d</p> <p>Bruce Gladwin says that, in 2016, there are probably more independent productions and films being developed around the world that embrace disability \u201calmost like an aesthetic choice\u201d and with \u201clarger casts of actors with disabilities\u201d.</p> <p>He continues: \u201cBut then, there\u2019s still other examples: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/17/the-dressmaker-review-jocelyn-moorhouse-blows-small-town-drama-sky-high\">The Dressmaker</a>, quite a big Australian feature film, had a character with an intellectual disability who was the lynchpin.\u201d</p> <p>Gladwin is referring to Gyton Grantley, who played Barney McSwiney in Jocelyn Moorhouse\u2019s film.

Brew had trained with the Australian Ballet School in Melbourne. \u201cMy body was my life,\u201d the former country boy from NSW told the Arts Activated conference at Carriageworks in Sydney in his keynote address: \u201cI was trained to believe a dancer had to be on two legs.\u201d</p> <p>Then, at age 20, he was in a car in Victoria with a group of friends when a drunk driver travelling on the wrong side of the road crashed into their vehicle head-on. Brew suffered massive internal injuries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7d235893ddacc5e042532d604afebb2d9fd92cc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d235893ddacc5e042532d604afebb2d9fd92cc5/0_0_3159_4748/665.jpg\" alt=\"Marc Brew in For Now, I Am in London in March\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marc Brew in For Now, I Am in London in March.

So he left for the UK, where he found greater support. Today, as artistic director of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/11/marc-brew-company-for-now-i-am-review-lilian-baylis-studio-london\">Marc Brew Company</a> in Glasgow, he choreographs as well as performs in his own works. Scotland\u2019s The Herald gave five stars to Brew\u2019s latest show, MayBe, staged in Glasgow last week.</p> <p>\u201cAccess can be embedded in the creative process, rather than an afterthought,\u201d Brew told his audience \u2013 meaning that access for his wheelchair becomes part of his act. Brew, who will be presenting <a href=\"http://accessarts.org.au/news-events/events/\">a masterclass in Brisbane</a> during his return visit to Australia, is encouraged that the country finally seems to be making progress in presenting work for dancers with disabilities.<br></p> <p>Sydney\u2019s Carriageworks, for instance, has committed to a national strategy called New Normal, which is commissioning 10 new works by artists with disability over three years.</p> <p>For one, staged in August, <a href=\"http://www.forcemajeure.com.au/\">Force Majeure</a> teamed with <a href=\"https://philipchannells.com/\">Dance Integrated Australia</a> to present <a href=\"http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/live-reviews/review-record-force-majeure-and-dance-integrated-australia\">Off the Record</a>, with some dancers and actors with perceived disabilities \u2013 from deafness to Tourette to Down syndrome \u2013 which went largely unstated in the piece. </p> <p>Dance Integrated Australia\u2019s founder and creative director, Philip Channells, says the company provides programs such as Corner Dance Lab and the Beyond Technique Residency to help people with physical, sensorial and mobility impairment attain the level of training that dancers who don\u2019t have a disability can already access.<br></p> <p>\u201cWith Off the Record, we weren\u2019t necessarily interested in making a statement about disability; we were wanting to challenge people\u2019s perceptions of society,\u201d says Channells. He argues disability is a \u201csort-of made-up word\u201d that \u201cdoesn\u2019t really exist: it\u2019s our social attitude towards people who live differently which makes things difficult and challenging\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Disability' doesn't really exist; it\u2019s our attitude towards people who live differently which makes things difficult.</p> <footer> <cite>Philip Channells, creative director of Dance Integrated Australia</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Australian arts companies often fail to budget for access needs for performers with disabilities, says Channells, and there is still a lack of educational opportunities for performers with disabilities.

  "<p>Autumn 1992. Tony Pulis is a rookie manager at Bournemouth setting out on the long road that has brought him to the point of his 1,000th match. His first company car, a gift from the chairman, Norman Hayward, has already been to the garage after smoke started pouring out of the dashboard on the M3 and Pulis is getting an early lesson in the economics of lower-division football.</p> <p>\u201cThe chairman has bought me a car that\u2019s about 20 years old,\u201d Pulis recalls. \u201cMoney meant everything to him. We went to watch Grimsby play one night. We drove up in his Mercedes, then all the way back and he dropped me off where my car, this enormous old shack, was parked by the road in Fordingbridge. The windscreen was iced up so I turned on my engine and Norman got out his credit card to try to get the ice off. As he was scraping away, I could suddenly hear him going: \u2018Oh my God, no! I can\u2019t believe it!\u2019 I thought he must have broken his credit card. He\u2019d actually just seen my tax disc. \u2018They\u2019ve given you 12 months,\u2019 he was shouting: \u2018I told them six months.\u2019 I&#xa0;said: \u2018Thanks Norman, that gives me loads of confidence.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Almost a quarter of a century on, Pulis is on the threshold of joining the 1,000 Club, or what Sir Alex Ferguson calls \u201cthe band of brothers\u201d. He will become the 25th manager on the list, meaning a place in the League Managers Association\u2019s hall of fame, and there is a neat symmetry about the West Bromwich Albion manager marking the achievement against Stoke City, the club he found \u201cdrifting nowhere\u201d and took to the Premier League.</p> <p>One of his interviews in the past few days began with a television reporter mischievously asking Pulis what had changed over the past 999 games, then adding: \u201cObviously not your tactics.\u201d Only a joke, perhaps, and Pulis is willing to send himself up on that front. \u201cPreston away, 1-1, August 15, 1992,\u201d he says of his first match in management. \u201cJohn Beck was the Preston manager and the corners of their pitch were filled with sand so the ball would stay in play. I learned from him, you see \u2026\u201d</p> <p>He can see the funny side but, at 58, Pulis has grown wearily accustomed to people denigrating his management style. \u201cYou get pigeonholed. You accept it or you fight it. I\u2019ve accepted it. That\u2019s what people think and it doesn\u2019t bother me. People go on about my style of play. But I tell you what I do \u2013 I go into football clubs, I try to find out what systems suit the players and I try to get the damnedest out of those players. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done everywhere I\u2019ve been. I\u2019ve got a load of centre-halves who can\u2019t pass. You want them to pass out from the back, but you have to look at their strengths and work round that.\u201d</p> <p>For the most part, that formula has been successful; otherwise Pulis would not be here looking back on a 24-year career that has taken him from Bournemouth to Gillingham, Bristol City, Portsmouth, Stoke, Plymouth, back to Stoke, Crystal Palace and now West Brom. His current job has looked vulnerable recently in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/west-brom-takeover-yunyi-guokai-sports-development-green-light\" title=\"\">Albion\u2019s takeover</a> but, overall, there has been plenty more good than bad. Even that trip to Grimsby. \u201cWe\u2019d gone to see Joe Parkinson, who was playing up there for Wigan \u2013 we signed him for \u00a320,000 and then sold him to Everton for \u00a3800,000.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan Shawcross, the Stoke captain, is another example. \u201cWe took Shawcross from Man United, where he was playing in the third team. He was just a tall streak of nothing when we saw him. He didn\u2019t have great balance, he wasn\u2019t strong. But we brought him in, worked him and worked him and I\u2019m absolutely delighted how well he\u2019s done.\u201d</p> <p>Shawcross also features in another story that demonstrates how Pulis, like many successful managers, knows how to use his temper to good effect. \u201cWe played at Blackburn and were 2-0 up at half-time, having absolutely murdered them. But the break always worries me when we\u2019ve played well because the flow stops. All the players were patting each other on the back so I went up to Ryan \u2013 who had been different class \u2013 and absolutely slaughtered him. Hammered him. Ryan\u2019s agent came on after the game saying he was down in the dumps and didn\u2019t know what had happened. I pulled Ryan in, told him he was my captain and I thought the world of him but the team needed a jolt because everybody was too comfortable \u2013 and he was the one who got it.\u201d</p> <p>At other times, Pulis has gone even further. He has no appetite to discuss the infamous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/dec/06/tony-pulis-james-beattie-stoke\" title=\"\">dressing-room encounter with James Beattie</a> (when Pulis is said to have head-butted his player, while completely naked, in a row about a cancelled Christmas party) but he does acknowledge the game has changed and managers can no longer pin players \u2013 \u201cthe film stars\u201d as he calls them \u2013 against the wall to make their point.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a time and place for that, but that was years ago. We\u2019ve moved on. There are times when I still lose my temper and go after one or two players but it would never come to that. You could not do it now, but I cannot say I have never lost my temper and I generally go for the senior players, never the young players. When I have lost it, I have lost it.\u201d</p> <p>Equally, there is a pragmatic streak to Pulis whereby he does not mind dealing with difficult characters on a short\u2011term basis. Jermaine Pennant is one he identifies. \u201cWe got a good 12 months out of him,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are players like that \u2013 you know they have been rascals, and that you can bring them in, give them a new environment and get a length of time out of them, but they will always return to type. You can get something out of them, then you have to get rid of them. Jermaine was always a one- or two-window player.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s management. It\u2019s a social job as much as anything else, finding out what people are like, seeing through them. There have been good players and not-so-good players who I have moved along because I thought there would be a clash of character. If someone has been top cock, or whatever you call it, I\u2019ve knocked him down, and he\u2019s responded&#xa0;\u2026 as Cloughie used to say: \u2018There\u2019s no room for two big heads in this club.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>At Gillingham, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/apr/28/newsstory.sport7\" title=\"\">his relationship with the chairman, Paul Scally, ended badly</a>, but his time at Priestfield was an early indication of Pulis\u2019s ability to make the most of what he had. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have a training ground so I got the groundsman to get a tractor, I put two goals on the back and we took them up to the park just up from the stadium. For the first month, doing all my shape and pattern for the new season, there were people walking past, old ladies with their shopping, one fella with his dog.\u201d</p> <p>This was in the age when dog-walkers did not bother with poop bags. \u201cI said: \u2018Excuse me\u2019 and he said: \u2018Listen son, I\u2019ve walked this park for 40 years and I don\u2019t care what you are playing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Pulis is not entirely comfortable with the way the modern game has \u201cgone Hollywood\u201d. Some of the kids these days drive him crackers. \u201cThe biggest thing is giving them too much too soon. We spoil them before they\u2019ve achieved anything. The Premier League, Sky, BT and everyone else have created this creature and they\u2019re spoilt, all the way through. They [Premier League players] are so far removed from society, and from the crux.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/16/tony-pulis-west-brom-new-owners\">Embattled Tony Pulis promises to stay at West Brom unless club sack him</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Compare the modern-day attitudes, he says, with Gary Mabbutt, the player he regards as the most inspirational he has ever known. \u201cAt Bristol Rovers when I started as a 17-year-old, I watched Mabbs at the back of the bus injecting insulin into his thigh because of his diabetes. One Christmas I was injured and had to go in for treatment. He was 16 or 17 years old. He was out with a load of balls on the training pitch, and that was Christmas morning.\u201d</p> <p>One thing that has never changed is the pain of defeat. \u201cI\u2019ve got a little room at home that I go in,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is just a television in there. My wife brings in my food and a glass of wine. Then she leaves me until the morning. I don\u2019t sleep much. Losing a game of football, even when you have played well, kills you. It must be a nightmare for football managers\u2019 wives, putting up with us.\u201d</p> <p>Otherwise, Pulis says the secret of his longevity is his ability to adjust with the times and deal with the modern player. He has, however, always remembered the advice of the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/oct/30/forgotten-story-alec-stock-qpr-manager\" title=\"\">Alec Stock</a>, one of the other members of the 1,000 Club. \u201cHe was in a nursing home in Wimbourne. I sat him with one day and one of the things he said was: \u2018Tony, always believe your eyes, never get away from that.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cPeter Coates [the Stoke chairman] wanted me to move with technology: \u2018You must have this, you must have that.\u2019 We had heart monitors and there was one pre-season when I didn\u2019t use them. Somebody asked me how I could know how the players were doing. I said: \u2018I know, because if they are sweating and moaning, they are fucking working.\u2019 That was my monitor. But I have embraced everything.\u201d</p> <p>Everything, that is, apart from social media (\u201csome of the stuff is crazy\u201d). On that basis, he might be unaware about the fascination with his match-day attire: the baseball cap, the tracksuit, the white trainers. Pulis, as the song goes, wears the club shop. \u201cI\u2019ve just had a shoot with the BBC and they wanted me to put some trainers on. I asked why and they said: \u2018You get new ones every game.\u2019 I said: \u2018What? This is West Bromwich Albion \u2013 they get washed. If they get muddy they get washed. It is a pat on the back for Jacko the kit man that he manages to get them so white. But they honestly thought I had a brand new pair delivered for every game.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond football, Pulis has plans to follow one of Napoleon\u2019s marches across the Italian alps \u201cat the same time of the year to understand what they went through\u201d.

We have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent. I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again.\u201d</p> <p>But Cruz and Trump clashed repeatedly in the primary campaign. An ardent conservative who played <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/13/sarah-palin-ted-cruz-veterans-shutdown\">a lead role in the government shutdown of 2013</a>, Cruz warned that Trump was not a conservative but rather a big-government liberal. Riding strong support among evangelical activists, Cruz propelled himself to victory in the Iowa caucuses and in 10 other states. He eventually finished second.</p> <p>Trump repeatedly attacked Cruz, not just politically but personally. In the course of the primary, he criticised Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/25/ted-cruz-brands-donald-trump-coward-feud-over-wives\">for her looks</a> and implied that the Texas senator\u2019s father was somehow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/may/03/cruz-attacks-trump-jfk-assassination-philanderer\">involved</a> in the assassination of John F Kennedy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father</p> <footer> <cite>Ted Cruz, in July</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/03/donald-trump-ted-cruz-jfk-assassination-indiana-primary-philanderer\">In a dramatic press conference</a> on the eve of the Indiana primary, Cruz called Trump a \u201cserial philanderer\u201d, an \u201camoral pathological liar\u201d and a \u201cbraggadocious, arrogant buffoon\u201d.

The next day, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/21/ted-cruz-donald-trump-texas-delegates-no-servile-puppy-dog\">said</a>: \u201cI am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father.</p> <p>\u201cThat [Republican party] pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi, that I\u2019m going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say, \u2018Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In his statement on Friday, Cruz said: \u201cThis election is unlike any other in our nation\u2019s history. Like many other voters, I have struggled to determine the right course of action in this general election.</p> <p>\u201cIn Cleveland, I urged voters, \u201cplease, don\u2019t stay home in November. Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket whom you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the constitution.\u201d</p> <p>He then detailed the issues on which he had made his decision, including appointments to the supreme court, healthcare, immigration, energy policy, national security and internet freedom.</p> <p>He concluded: \u201cOur country is in crisis. Hillary Clinton is manifestly unfit to be president, and her policies would harm millions of Americans. And Donald Trump is the only thing standing in her way.</p> <p>\u201cA year ago, I pledged to endorse the Republican nominee, and I am honoring that commitment.

  "<p>The number of people living in unhappy relationships has <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3802176/We-wealthier-healthier-STRESSED-Report-nation-s-shows-people-living-longer-unhappier-lives.html\" title=\"\">more than doubled in five years</a>, to over 1 million, according to research by the Office for National Statistics. A few methodological questions leap out immediately: since when did the ONS ask us about misery and, more precisely, whether or not it\u2019s relationship-based? Exactly how granular does the level of questioning get \u2013 are you required to put down exactly what it is about your partner that makes you so miserable, so they can be sure you\u2019re not just a miserable person who happens to be in a relationship? And do they extrapolate from one miserable person that there must be another, or is there leeway for the person in despair to have a spouse who thinks that everything\u2019s fine? These figures could be much higher or much lower, is all I\u2019m saying. But either way, they\u2019re not great.</p> <p>Since these couples are becoming less happy as the economy improves, this has been taken by some as proof that it is a financial recovery, rather than a recession, that chips away at marital bliss. The charity Relate uses the term <a href=\"https://www.relate.org.uk/sites/default/files/publication-social-recession-report-sept2014_0.pdf\" title=\"\">\u201csocial recession\u201d</a>, though, to indicate that there\u2019s a lag between an economic bust and a personal bust-up: relationships deteriorate in the wake of a financial recession, not in tandem with it.</p> <p>The mechanism by which money, or lack of it, can erode harmony over time is perfectly clear. There\u2019s an equally clear fault line: on one side will be the people who were only together because they couldn\u2019t afford to split up, and living like that over time will have made them more desperate; on the other, the people who probably wouldn\u2019t have wanted to split up, had money not made them both so miserable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Austerity has made life less livable, and the social landscape has come to replicate a gloomy marriage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You wouldn\u2019t wish a reconciliation on the first group. You would wish them the resources they need to enact their desires. For the second group, things are muddier. Did financial pressures make them work too hard, so they were too tired to empathise, and never saw one another, so their grievances deepened? Did the sheer anxiety of worrying about money change their brain chemistry, interrupting the generosity that makes human intimacy possible? Are those situations reversible, once there\u2019s more money to go around? It\u2019s pretty difficult when you\u2019re miserable to tell exactly which sort of misery yours is. Besides which, too long living as people who wanted to split only because of money worries will turn you inevitably into people who can\u2019t imagine wanting to stay together.</p> <p>If this is social recession at micro level, it is interesting to consider the macro trend. Financial recessions have similar impacts on extended families and friendship groups, with a similar time lag. In the immediate aftermath of a fiscal shock, say a person has lost their job. A family will rally round. Indeed, it feels like a deeper bond when you need one another and will admit it. I\u2019ve heard workers at both debt charities and food banks observe that the spike in demand is often some years after the recession itself, as the well of informal support runs dry. It is humiliating to need help, and painful to run out of the means to give it. But families will spend years trying before they sink.</p> <p>To pan out more widely still, there is a feeling of a social marriage collapsing after too long spent trying to live peaceably on not quite enough. The dirtiest and most acrimonious divorce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/15/labour-death-spite-bullying-working-class-base\" title=\"\">is happening in the Labour party</a>, as both sides fling ever more savage accusations at each other, in a bid for custody over the infrastructure (the Tories are more like the miserable households of the ONS, putting a brave face on a union of convenience).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/18/jeremy-corbyn-labour-make-up-or-break-up\">After Jeremy Corbyn wins, Labour has to make up or break up | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But politics in its broadest sense, the strands that constitute the fabric, is unravelling. The genius of the austerity narrative for two or three years after the crash was that it sounded quite fun, a Blitz-style project that would both unite us and remind us of what was really important. Yoked to the donkey that was \u201cbig society\u201d, it was supposed to be exciting to cut social security and pare back the shared resources of the state. It would give us the space to show how much we really cared for one another. Community spirit, in this frame, had been crowded out pre-2007 by too much generosity from the centre.</p> <p>It was always nonsense, as many of us politely noted from the start, and should never have been called austerity but rather a redistribution from the poor to the rich. As the years of belt-tightening have made life less liveable, the social landscape has come to replicate an unhappy marriage: what were previously points of difference \u2013 were you more or less concerned with sovereignty, more or less happy about immigration, more or less international in outlook? \u2013 have hardened into positions that are completely irreconcilable.</p> <p>The rules of warmth that you need to&#xa0;resolve conflict \u2013 assume goodwill, say things earlier rather than later \u2013 have&#xa0;been replaced by each side imputing terrible motives or wilful stupidity to&#xa0;the other. As a country we have painted ourselves into a corner where, in the best case scenario, only half of us will be deeply unhappy. The difference is that we can\u2019t divorce. We can\u2019t even have a trial separation. We need some kind of mediation to get through this: maybe a neutral outsider (Switzerland?) or perhaps Relate could launch a political wing. I don\u2019t think GDP is going to help.</p>",

  "<p>Andrew Veitch, who has died aged 70, was one of those journalists with a sustained talent for self-invention: a talent driven by enthusiasm, curiosity and a generous sense of responsibility. It took him to Channel 4 News as science correspondent, covering health and environment stories, as well as the occasional international crisis, and then from 2003 to BBC World, working as a freelance producer, writer and presenter of documentaries made by Rockhopper Productions.</p> <p>However, Andy started in print, joining the Guardian in 1971. He became a subeditor in the features department \u2013 taking the reporter\u2019s typewritten prose and the photographer\u2019s printed pictures and composing them into finished newspaper pages to be steered through a complex process of hot metal production \u2013 but metamorphosed into a medical correspondent.</p> <p>He did so in a single unilateral act, after being awarded the role of assistant technology correspondent to write about the then new technology of personal computing. Instead, he found a story about genital herpes \u2013 not a subject at the time high on the national news agenda \u2013 wrote about it, and slapped on the first page the words \u201cAndrew Veitch, medical correspondent\u201d. At the time, the paper had no medical correspondent, and had not thought it needed one.</p> <p>In vitro fertilisation was a new and advancing field, with much to be explained. The arrival, very swiftly, of a then mystifying source of sickness and death that was later to be called HIV/Aids settled the matter. Andy became a distinguished medical correspondent, and reported with energy, intelligence and forthrightness on a swiftly changing, and politically charged, field of research.</p> <p>At the time, a bewildered government balked at confronting what would become an international epidemic of devastating proportions. A shared understanding between research scientists and journalists helped to change attitudes and educate a nation, and Andy was one of those who led the way. Words and phrases once rarely used in mainstream newspapers \u2013 semen, rectum, retrovirus, shared hypodermic needle and so on \u2013 became part of the language of public debate, and he used them as always with good humour and gusto. Throughout a lifetime career he sustained the same enjoyable mix of self-deprecation and colossal enthusiasm for the story in hand.</p> <p>Born in Wrexham, north Wales, Andy was the son of Andrew, an engineer, and May (nee Silver), a primary school teacher. As his father was working on contracts abroad, he spent his early childhood in Guyana, an experience that he claimed led to a passion for travel and adventure. At the age of 11, he returned to England to board at Reading school, and went on to Trinity College Dublin. It was there, at 18, that he met his wife-to-be, Liz. They married in 1968. He claimed that he scraped through a social science degree, and he may have devoted more enthusiasm to the student newspaper, which in his last year he edited.</p> <p>He began as a journalist on the Middlesbrough Evening Gazette and then joined the Manchester office of the Guardian, as a subeditor on the then separate northern edition. In 1976 the two editions merged, and Andy moved to the newspaper\u2019s new Farringdon Road headquarters in London. Like most subeditors, he could write well, and could have been a brilliant theatre critic: at the time, however, the newspaper already had a brilliant theatre critic in Michael Billington, so Andy\u2019s reviews were occasional.</p> <p>He became a subeditor on the Guardian\u2019s women\u2019s pages, at a time when columnists including Jill Tweedie and Polly Toynbee set the social agenda, and worked closely with two women\u2019s editors, Liz Forgan and Frances Cairncross. He also edited a gloriously funny anthology of sexism called The Naked Ape (1981), based on a women\u2019s page column of the time.</p> <p>Forgan went to the newly founded Channel 4, and after 17 years at the Guardian Andy followed her in 1988. HIV/Aids remained a powerful story. At the time there was no treatment, still only limited understanding of the infection, and diagnosis was understood to be a slow sentence of death. But the 1980s also saw the first ominous reports of climate change, the beginning of the politically embarrassing and economically devastating decade-long drama of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease), a nationwide epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease and a consortium of scientists pushing through a programme to sequence the entire human genome, a project at the time so huge that it was called \u201cbiology\u2019s Apollo\u201d.</p> <p>Andy\u2019s to-camera reporting career \u2013 often in a navy blue blazer, sometimes topped by a big red waterproof anorak \u2013 took him to the Arctic, the Antarctic, the tropics, Russia and the Kurdish refugee camps after the first Gulf war. He was awarded honours by the Royal Television Society for his work in exposing a Russian nuclear weapons disaster; by the Terrence Higgins Trust for his reporting on Aids; and by the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the Wildscreen and One World film and TV festivals. He also won a record seven British Environment and Media awards, mostly for his films from Russia and the polar regions.</p> <p>He maintained a sharp sense of integrity, but was never sententious. Throughout he remained the generous, zestful and sometimes turbulent colleague he had always been, with a huge appetite for life and work. \u201cHe could drink you under the table and still beat you to the story,\u201d said one television colleague.</p> <p>Andy lived in Hackney, in the East End of London, and there became a force behind the hugely successful Broadway Market initiative, raising sums for local charities. He developed the bone marrow disorder myelofibrosis, needing care first at Bart\u2019s hospital and then at St Joseph\u2019s hospice in Hackney, but he carried on, being who he was and doing what he could for as long as he could.</p> <p>He is survived by Liz, their sons, Joel and Alexander, and five grandchildren, Abigail, Zachariah, Bliss, Toby and Tallulah.</p> <p><em> \u2022 </em>Andrew Veitch, journalist, born 15 July 1946; died 4 September 2016</p>",
  "<p>The media industry may be in flux; the printed word may be in decline. But as an organisation where every editor-in-chief is given the sole brief of executing his or her job \u201cas heretofore\u201d, there are some traditions at the Guardian we hold dear.</p> <p>Chief among them is morning conference, which takes place every day at 10am (though some of us are old enough to remember a slower, pre-digital world where it was 10.30). Anyone from across the company is welcome to attend \u2013 though shortly after the Brexit vote the numbers got so unwieldy we had to move to a bigger room and for a short period it was limited to editorial staff only. </p> <p>It starts with the editor-in-chief giving her assessment of the work of the previous 24 hours, talking about what she thinks we did well and what we missed, in print and online, followed by listings as section editors talk about their plans for the day ahead.</p> <p>Then comes the fun bit. The editor asks: \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting today?\u201d Occasionally, the question is met with a brief, awkward silence that makes you feel like an extra in Abigail\u2019s Party; usually there\u2019s an issue someone\u2019s desperate to raise. And always, sooner or later, conversation starts flowing. This week, like most weeks, we\u2019ve covered a range of issues.</p> <p>Some can be quite ideological. When someone said he wished we\u2019d written more about a Fabian publication on Brexit because it advocated the kind of immigration controls the left must embrace to both win back its base and protect social democracy, it sparked a lively discussion. </p> <p>\u201cImmigration controls are currently designed to keep poor people out,\u201d argued one journalist. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing leftwing about that.\u201d</p> <p> \u201cWithout them one can\u2019t protect the welfare state,\u201d came the retort. </p> <p>\u201cWith them you are simply a huge gated community denying entry to travellers from the developing world,\u201d was the response. The back and forth did not drag on too long. But the issues raised were interesting enough for some to consider how we might best host a series of debates on the left\u2019s response to immigration.</p> <p>Sometimes these conversations at conference might look like interesting chats. But these are working meetings. We figure if we\u2019ve found the discussion stimulating we should probably engage readers in it.</p> <p>But while a debate about immigration and the left might be necessary, it will have to wait until after the results of the Labour leadership election, which has once again sucked almost all the oxygen out of any discussion about what the left should do about anything. The Guardian is by no means immune to that. The same kind of discussions about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership that are taking place in pubs and at dinner tables across the country make their way to Guardian conference.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5caa5820d17ff6a2e04b893baad497ae4d659543\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5caa5820d17ff6a2e04b893baad497ae4d659543/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Owen Smith and Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owen Smith and Jeremy Corbyn \u2026 the other pair dividing opinion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019ve had the \u201che can\u2019t win an election\u201d discussion; the \u201che just won an election\u201d discussion; and the \u201cI meant a general election\u201d discussion. We\u2019ve had the \u201cmedia are unfair\u201d discussion; the \u201cthe media may be unfair but he is useless\u201d discussion and the \u201cif he\u2019s so useless how comes he keeps winning elections\u201d discussion, which often brings us back to the \u201cI meant general election\u201d discussion. </p> <p>This week the more predictable exchanges gave way to a less adversarial conversation after one person homed in on a quote from a recent interview Corbyn did with the Guardian, in which he was quite candid about how his leadership style differed from that of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. A well-informed conversation ensued about how a significant section of the Corbyn camp had been initially unhappy about his appointment and why that might have been.</p> <p>At times we take a breath, bringing in experts and shifting from the news agenda to issues that never go away but are rarely discussed outside a sense of crisis. This week the subject was autism, and the experts were our own colleagues. Two of them, who have family members with autism, gave a presentation. One pointed out that, while we cover the issue well, we are too often sloppy with our language, using the term autistic as a casual descriptor rather than a medical term. The other took us through five of the most prevalent myths about autism. </p> <p>On another day conference was divided by the burning issue of the week: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\u2019s break-up. Not whether they should have separated \u2013 no one in the room had any intel on that score \u2013 but whether the Guardian should have sent out a mobile app alert about it. </p> <p>Alerts are usually for terrorist incidents, ministerial resignations, Brexit \u2013 you know, Big Stuff. On that scale, how big are Brangelina\u2019s relationship troubles? Some thought it was legitimate: if that\u2019s what people were going to talk about, why wouldn\u2019t we be among the first to let them know? Others felt we shouldn\u2019t have sent an alert since there was no broader significance \u2013 assuming they didn\u2019t break up over intervention in Syria \u2013 and that it\u2019s not why the Guardian exists.</p> <p>But then the subject was very popular among our most regular readers online. So maybe we should cover it for them? Sounds like a subject for another conference. </p>",

Readers discuss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now in its third series, FTTF, which began in 2014, is an anomaly for many reasons. While websites and broadcasters scramble to cater to a youth market, Four to the Floor, tucked away on late-night Channel 4, effortlessly and accurately represents the attitude of 16- to 24-year-olds without condescending or disingenuously adopting quick-fix, zeitgeist-chasing trends.</p> <p>The first episode of this series begins with with spoken word poetry about overturning the old guard, positive activism and seizing the day, which segues into a session from politically charged <a href=\"http://mostlyjazz.co.uk/line-up/united-vibrations/\">jazz-fusion group United Vibrations</a>. It sounds like the stuff of squat party nightmares but here it comes alive. It is unselfconscious, joyous and totally sincere in an era of sneering cynicism on social media. It provides a space for the surreal to mix with the savage, and where punk, grime, jungle, jazz, R&amp;B and the indefinable coexist. It is interspersed with strange animations and visceral spoken word poetry; all of which is unfiltered by PR approval or mainstream influence. It is a true culture clash. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/184003072\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/184003072\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Created in 12 weeks this summer, the third series was unwittingly defined by Britain\u2019s Brexit decision. James Payne, who is the executive producer of the show and founded its production company Lemonade Money, wanted to convey a \u201cnewfound confidence in what being British means\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was really odd because we had already decided, when we were supposed to film back in spring, that we wanted to loosely ask: what does being British mean? Then Brexit happened and it felt even more relevant. We didn\u2019t have to introduce those topics to artists, people just wanted to talk about them. It showed a real generation gap \u2013 younger people feel differently about things and there\u2019s this sense [national identity] is almost irrelevant. They are creating their own economies and trading among themselves and travelling the world; their friendship groups are all over the planet, not just the country.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3c2c72047298dc6dd2a9fb46625804a932adfee6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c2c72047298dc6dd2a9fb46625804a932adfee6/210_0_458_458/458.jpg\" alt=\"Four to the Floor\" width=\"458\" height=\"458\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An animation from Four to the Floor</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Four to the Floor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a result of its pertinent timing, the finished product is more like a piece of journalism than a showcase of talent: its subjects are articulate on the subject of identity, frustrations and how important it is to create a community with your art. One episode is shot in South Africa, and promotes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/south-african-students-speak-out-ban-afro-hair-pretoria-school\">a message of empowerment, that protest</a> can overturn government decisions, that young people should not accept defeat and be silenced.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say the artist choices are simply a backdrop to the core message. As well as shining a light on up-and-coming grime producer and MC Rocks Foe and Neverland Clan \u2013 AKA \u201cthe world\u2019s gnarliest boyband\u201d \u2013 the show features veteran group King Tubby\u2019s Sound System; alt-rock duo Cassels play their music to their grandparents for the first time, and grime photographer Vicky Grout urges anyone watching to put an end to political apathy. While Jools Holland often gives a platform to those who already have a voice, Four to the Floor is a mixtape of whatever those at Lemonade Money are listening to or are interested in; it is a crucial opportunity to promote creatives who do not have stadium headlining ambitions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/22/young-people-living-in-a-suspended-adulthood-finds-research\">Young people living in a 'suspended adulthood', finds research</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMore so than ever, it seems to me that there\u2019s a connection with things that are honest and more and more so \u2013 this younger generation are not bullshit-able,\u201d says Payne of their artist choices. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for a whole generation, but we work with people from a lot of backgrounds, socially and economically, and there\u2019s a desire to find the truth in things rather than get bullshitted.\u201d</p> <p>Making music TV so magically off-kilter is not an easy sell when broadcasters are keen to stick with the safe. With the absence of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00704hg\">Top of the Pops</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tv.com/shows/cduk/\">CD:UK</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FZnUPhphyc\">Popworld</a>, there have been short-lived attempts to rebuild the format for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jul/24/tv-bad-at-music-shows\">artist performance and interviews on TV</a>, but they\u2019ve never been given the chance to flourish. It would be fair to suggest that the youth market is not interested in TV. But while Vice and Boiler Room both cater to a captive audience online, there\u2019s a sense that they are preaching to the converted: the appeal of airing on Channel 4 allows the show to arrive in the homes of many people who might not have been seeking it. </p> <p>In spite of Four to the Floor\u2019s encouraging message, Payne does not think post-millennials are in for an easy ride. But for him and his team, it is vital that this show exists to inspire hope in those who are told their future is hopeless.</p> <p>\u201cNot everything is great, by a long shot. [These are] difficult times, but we\u2019ve got to tell stories about ourselves rather than allowing other people to tell stories about us,\u201d says Payne.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to be influenced by negative thoughts and there\u2019s a lot to be proud of \u2013 we have an incredible culture here and that\u2019s come from immigration. The roots of so much of not just <em>our</em> culture but worldwide culture \u2013 dance culture, drum\u2019n\u2019bass, hardcore, garage, grime, jungle \u2013 these things that define a lot of people\u2019s lives, is because of this mix and this mad little grey, cold island in the middle of the North Sea.

Since then, she has set about unravelling key aspects of Osborne\u2019s economic policy and overturning central tenets of Cameron\u2019s premiership, such as his opposition to bringing back grammar schools.</p> <p>Osborne indicated in a BBC Radio 4 interview last week that he would stay on the political scene but he gave only a lukewarm endorsement of May\u2019s premiership.</p> <p>May is facing competing pressures when it comes to carrying out negotiations with the EU. She has said she wants a bespoke deal for Britain that preserves free trade at the same time as curbing free movement for EU citizens to come to Britain.</p> <p>Some of the most hardline Eurosceptics would like her to be prepared to walk away from the single market and close trade cooperation if the EU does not concede to strict controls on immigration.</p>",

This was over inside the opening ten minutes when a Sydney blitz knocked the stuffing out of Geelong. The Swans were too slick in tight, too decisive in the open and too ferocious whenever they lost possession. </p> <p>Geelong were poor. Their intensity was lacking and their skills were slipshod. As had been feared all season, too much was left to too few, and despite Joel Selwood and Patrick Dangerfield dominating the individual stats sheet they were never more than bit-part players in Sydney\u2019s procession.</p> <p>Aliir Aliir\u2019s injury was the only concern for the night and he joins the list of Swans battling to be fit for the grand final. The only question now is who they\u2019ll play?

The 2011 premiers against the best of 2012. The club with the likely Brownlow Medalist against the one with the AFL Rising Star. Geelong and Sydney are bona fide modern heavyweights.</p> <p>The Cats, with home state advantage and plenty of rest after just one match in the past month, start as favourites. The Swans, beaten up by the Giants and luckless with injury against the Crows, have flown interstate off a six day break. Theirs is a tall order.</p> <p>Quite literally based on the 22 Chris Scott has listed. Tom Hawkins will straighten up Geelong with his bulk up forward, and around him Rhys Stanley, Zac Smith, Marc Blicavs and Lachie Henderson will all spend time forcing Sydney defenders to play with their chins up. Much will be asked of Heath Grundy, Aliir Aliir and Dane Rampe against a side with the most number of marks inside 50 for the year.</p> <p>The opposite is the case at the other end of the ground where Geelong\u2019s defence matches up tall against Sydney\u2019s forward line. Lance Franklin\u2019s duel with Tom Lonergan will be eye catching but could prove a sideshow compared to the involvement of Ben McGlynn and Tom Papley at ground level. The recalled Jed Bews has been picked to perform a vital job.</p> <p>In between we know what to expect. The Swans bat deeper than anybody in midfield but the Cats possess the most dynamic one-two combination. Some tantalising head to heads are bound to materialise over the course of the night.</p> <p>It\u2019s preliminary final weekend, kicking off with two evenly matched sides in front of a packed MCG.

  "<p>Teachers and bus drivers need training to tackle \u201cblatant and latent\u201d prejudice and indifference before it escalates into hate crime, according to a new report.</p> <p>The recommendations from the Scottish government\u2019s independent advisory group on hate crime, prejudice and community cohesion, published on Friday, suggest that responsibility for tackling hate crime in society should extend beyond the criminal justice system. </p> <p>In the first major investigation into hate crime in Scotland since a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/19/embassies-alleged-hate-crimes-since-brexit-vote\">significant rise in alleged incidents was reported</a> across the UK following the Brexit vote in June, the group examined how external events \u2013 such as the terrorist attacks in Paris, the EU referendum and football matches \u2013 made some people feel that they had \u201cpermission\u201d to attack others on the basis of their identity.</p> <p>The inquiry was led by Duncan Morrow, from the University of Ulster, who previously chaired a similar group set up by the Scottish government to investigate sectarianism, and examined the day-to-day experiences of those facing prejudice based on their race, faith, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability.</p> <p>Many of the report\u2019s recommendations are focused on ensuring that the criminal justice response to hate crime is clear, swift and consistent. In particular, the report criticises the patchy operation across the UK of the existing third-party reporting system. </p> <p>Morrow said, however, that hate crime needed to be treated as a citizenship as much as justice issue. </p> <p>\u201cIn addition to supporting improvement in criminal justice, there needs to be a recognition that these kind of crimes emerge from a background of blatant and latent prejudice and indifference which festers far beyond individual attacks,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cAttacks on people because of their identity with a group get traction in a climate where perpetrators may feel that they are acting \u2018with permission\u2019, or \u2018with the sympathy of the wider community\u2019, both spoken and unspoken.\u201d</p> <p>Morrow said that many of those interviewed for the report described a \u201cconstant drip of insult, harassment and verbal abuse\u201d as an everyday normality\u201d, resulting in loss of confidence and social isolation. \u201cYet most of this never reaches the threshold of crime, and more often than not there are few witnesses.\u201d</p> <p>He said one solution was to train bystanders to intervene. \u201cSchools and teachers are often in the front line. Youth workers, transport providers and community organisations are often in a position to act more immediately and more effectively. Identifying ways for people to act without putting themselves at risk is important.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we would like to see is training for people in immediate responsibility, like school teachers or bus drivers, and education on how to report and respond to violent incidents for the general public.\u201d</p> <p>In recent years, Police Scotland has developed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/08/rape-prevention-campaign-young-men-police-scotland-advert\">bystander training as a key part of its strategy to tackle sexual and domestic violence</a>. The force has worked with bar and club owners, for example, to train staff to recognise situations where a woman may be vulnerable to sexual assault, and teach them to intervene safely.</p> <p>Morrow\u2019s report focused on public transport as \u201ca particular kind of enclosed space where a vulnerable individual was often more at risk\u201d. He described it as \u201cemblematic of the unexpected places where hate crime becomes real\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cPeople stopping travelling or going out at night may feel like small steps, but they have significant impact on community cohesion and a sense of public safety,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The report suggests the Scottish government consider changes to the legal framework governing hate crime in Scotland, including extending protection to include gender, age and membership of other groups such as refugees and asylum seekers. </p> <p>It also calls for measures to improve the monitoring of online hate crime and prejudice, and responses to it.</p> <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission in Scotland welcomed the report. Its director, Alastair Pringle, said: \u201cThis is fundamentally a responsibility for all of us in Scotland. We all have a part to play, from the Scottish government, to our schools, to our workplaces, to each of us all as individuals. </p> <p>\u201cI was struck by a recent reported case where several passengers complained about the offensive behaviour and racist language from other passengers on a flight to Ibiza last week. This resulted in their removal from the flight. </p> <p>\u201cI think this demonstrates exactly how we can make a change in society by refusing to be a bystander, showing responsible leadership by example and speaking up and being an active citizen.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I am clinging to the last vestiges of summer by heading to the country as much as possible in an attempt to keep that carefree holiday feeling going a little while longer. There is an added bonus at this time of year, because there is a free feast just waiting to be picked up in our woods and hedgerows. Brambles abound in country and city alike, and you don\u2019t have to stick to crumble or jam, either: try something a bit more adventurous, such as a blackberry souffl\u00e9 \u2013 a fine mix of simplicity and sophistication.</p> <p>For wild meat, you may need to travel farther afield, or at least have a good butcher nearby; even so, there\u2019s bags of choice right now. Rabbit is seriously good in today\u2019s pasta recipe, although you could use chicken instead; it\u2019s kinder to buy wild rabbit than farmed, although the latter is more reliably tender and less gamey. Alternatively, leave it out altogether: the sauce will still be silky, rich and deeply savoury.</p> <h2><strong>Rabbit, chestnut and mushroom pappardelle</strong></h2> <p>The chestnuts, mushrooms and olives give this creamy sauce a rich, savoury flavour that belies the simplicity of the recipe. Serves six.</p> <p><strong>1 rabbit, jointed (roughly 1.25kg)</strong><br><strong>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br><strong>60g butter</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp olive (or rapeseed) oil</strong><br><strong>12 baby onions, peeled</strong><br><strong>2 large garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced</strong><br><strong>1 sprig rosemary, leaves picked and finely chopped</strong><br><strong>300ml white wine</strong><br><strong>400ml water</strong><br><strong>2 bay leaves </strong><br><strong>75g chestnut mushrooms, finely sliced</strong><br><strong>100g cooked chestnuts, sliced</strong><br><strong>5 tbsp double cream</strong><br><strong>Zest of \u00bd lemon</strong><br><strong>10 fat green olives, stoned and finely chopped </strong><br><strong>600g wholewheat pappardelle</strong></p> <p>To serve<br><strong>50g freshly grated pecorino</strong><br><strong>Freshly grated nutmeg</strong><br><strong>2-3 tbsp good extra-virgin olive oil</strong><br><strong>1 handful picked flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped</strong></p> <p>Season the rabbit generously. Heat a third of the butter and half the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed casserole, brown the rabbit all over, then transfer to a plate. Wipe clean the pan with a damp cloth, add half the remaining butter and the rest of the oil, then fry the baby onions on a medium-high heat until golden. Stir in the garlic and rosemary, cook for a minute or two, then add the wine and water and bring to a boil. Return the rabbit to the pot and add the bay leaves, then lower the heat and simmer uncovered for 30-35 minutes, until the meat is tender enough to pull apart with two forks and the liquid has reduced to a thick syrup.</p> <p>Meanwhile, heat the remaining butter in a pan over a high heat, add the mushrooms, season generously and saute until deep golden and the liquid has evaporated. Add the chestnuts, fry for a minute or two, then set aside. When the rabbit is tender, lift it on to a board and shred the meat from the bones. If the liquid is still on the watery side, turn up the heat and reduce it. Return the mushrooms and chestnuts to the pan, add the cream, lemon zest, olives and shredded meat, then gently reheat. Taste for seasoning \u2013 it may need more salt and will definitely want plenty of pepper. Keep warm over a low heat.</p> <p>Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil and add the pasta. Cook for eight minutes, or until al dente. Drain, reserving a cup of the cooking water, then toss the pasta through the sauce. Stir in half the pecorino and lots of nutmeg, leave to sit for a few minutes \u2013 the pasta will absorb much of the liquid in the sauce \u2013 then stir in enough of the reserved water to make the sauce glossy. Divide among four shallow bowls, and serve drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil and scattered with the rest of the pecorino and the parsley.</p> <h2><strong>Blackberry souffl\u00e9</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fc2eeb9d717aaf9b044deca8e1c1f77f3a28b2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fc2eeb9d717aaf9b044deca8e1c1f77f3a28b2a/0_118_1881_1128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers\u2019 blackberry souffl\u00e9.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers\u2019 blackberry souffl\u00e9.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian.

  "<h2>1<strong> Abstract Expressionism</strong></h2> <p>Prepare to be awed and exhilarated by some of the greatest art of the modern age. In the 1940s, a generation of New York artists who were fascinated by the psychoanalytic escapades of European surrealists and impressed by the muralists of revolutionary Mexico invented a new kind of art that was spacious, all-embracing, sublime and cosmic. Jackson Pollock was the first to become famous for his dripped and flicked curls of colour. Willem de Kooning painted his sexual demons, Mark Rothko the colours of nausea.

  "<p>While there is much that the Labour leadership can do to help ensure national electoral success once <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourleadership\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn is crowned for the second time</a>, the most important factor is not in the hands of the Westminster villagers. It is the hundreds of thousands of people that make up the new mass membership of the party that can have the biggest impact.

And they can get started on it straight away.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/23/theresa-may-never-won-election-prime-minister-labour-never-does\">May has never won an election as prime minister.

The marketing approach treats the electorate as consumers with fixed preferences, where the ideal politician is a polished salesperson armed with a perfectly calibrated retail policy offer. The movement-building approach treats public opinion as a changeable landscape, where elections are won not only by competent politicians but by social forces mobilised in support of a transformative agenda.</p> <p>As Gilbert notes, the problem with the marketing approach is that it cannot explain how socio-political change happens. Imagine if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/06/sylvia-pankhurst-honoured-at-last\" title=\"\">Sylvia Pankhurst</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/31/rosa-parks-100-american-rebel-justice\" title=\"\">Rosa Parks</a> had said that \u201cwe have to accept where people are\u201d on women\u2019s rights, or \u201cwe understand the public\u2019s legitimate concerns\u201d on desegregation. The legacy of those figures, and thousands of activists like them, is a standing rebuke to the oft-repeated, ahistorical nonsense that Labour can achieve nothing with protest, but only by first winning power. In reality, the power to enact serious change can only be won by first preparing the ground through patient and committed grassroots action.</p> <p>The other problem with the marketing approach is that it encourages the erasure of moral red lines. If majority opinion blames immigrants and people on social security for the country\u2019s problems, then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/21/labour-disarray-welfare-48-mps-defy-whips\" title=\"\">Labour must appeal</a> to these voter-consumer preferences.

The marketing approach precludes not only a transformative agenda, but sometimes even basic levels of human decency.</p> <p>The alternative is to treat people as adults who can be engaged in conversation and potentially persuaded of a different point of view. And the emergence of a social movement means that the task of persuasion can be taken up, not by a remote elite, but by your friends, family, neighbours and colleagues. In workplaces, round dinner tables, in pubs and cafes, every lying tabloid front-page can now be met with a counterargument from a familiar and trusted voice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/jeremy-corbyn-not-unpopular-but-divisive\">Jeremy Corbyn is not unpopular \u2013 but he is divisive | John Curtice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labour members can win the right to be heard by taking up a multitude of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/777767689846599680\" title=\"\">local causes</a> in communities up and down the country.

But those members should not allow themselves to be demoralised by what\u2019s happening in Westminster. Instead, they can take the initiative themselves, and set about shifting the ground on which future general elections will be fought and won. In time, their children and grandchildren will look back on that work with gratitude, as they enjoy life in the better, happier country that it helped to create.</p>",
  "<p>The danger in having a moon village as your vision for the future is that people get the wrong impression. The mind leaps ahead and lands on a movie set: a giant dome shelters a huddle of homes, a bank of generators, and a modestly-stocked shop that doubles as the post office. A lost spacefarer with a PhD in botany clings to life by growing spuds in human faeces.</p> <p>The idea is so easily misconstrued that Jan Woerner, the director general of the European Space Agency (ESA), makes clear from the start what the moon village is not. \u201cLet me tell you what it won\u2019t mean,\u201d he says. \u201cSingle houses, a school, a church, a swimming pool, a bakery, an undertaker. This is not what I\u2019m thinking about.\u201d<br></p> <p>What he does have in mind is the future of human space exploration. In a decade or so, the International Space Station will be done with. The $150bn outpost will plunge back to Earth in a fireball above the Pacific Ocean leaving astronauts with nowhere to go. If humans want to maintain a presence in space, they need a new plan, and soon.<br></p> <p>While Nasa remains fixated on sending people to Mars - a challenge of daunting technical difficulty - ESA under Woerner sees the moon as the obvious next venture for a long time to come. The \u201cvillage\u201d he has in mind is a diverse community of public and private organisations that work on the moon together. A band of nations might build a telescope on the far side of the moon, where observations are shielded from Earth\u2019s electromagnetic din. A single agency could test whether robots can make radiation-proof habitats from lunar regolith. A tech firm could extract water from polar ice and turn some into hydrogen, oxygen and rocket fuel. Another might break into lunar tourism.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1949b78b753beb5a65e683d1e2a0e579dcba0ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1949b78b753beb5a65e683d1e2a0e579dcba0ad/96_0_2343_1406/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ESA\u2019s Jan Woerner is quick to point out that his moon village vision is not \u201csingle houses, a school, a church, a swimming pool, a bakery, an undertakers.

In time, Woerner says, it would build up the vital infrastructure and practical know-how that humans will need to head more safely into the farther reaches of the solar system.<br></p> <p>Woerner has kicked the idea around for a while, but will raise it formally with ESA\u2019s ministerial council for the first time later this year. \u201cIt\u2019s an inspiring concept, and if others have a better idea, I am ready to change my mind. But so far I can tell you that the moon village is my favourite solution for the future,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe moon is the next logical stepping stone.\u201d<br></p> <p>He has plenty of support. \u201cThe question is what to do after the space station,\u2019 says Ian Crawford, professor of planetary science at Birkbeck, University of London. \u201cEither nothing follows and you shut down human space exploration, or you build another space station \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to see the point of that \u2013 or you go somewhere else, and I strongly believe the moon is the next place to go.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It is more a necessity than a desire, Crawford says. Before we head to Mars \u2013 or any other faraway body \u2013 humans must learn how to thrive in dusty, high radiation environments. \u201cTo send people to Mars you have to be very confident in all aspects of the technology,\u201d he says. \u201cGoing to the moon is risky too, but the advantage of learning and trialling all this stuff on the moon is that if something goes wrong, you can bring people back. The moon is only three days away. Abort options exist.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The moon itself is a laboratory. An archive of solar system history, the signatures of meteorites, comets and the solar wind are written in the dust. A moon village would give scientists the means to explore the body, a lump of the ancient Earth, much as Antarctic bases have opened up the southern continent.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45e045e3974fee56dd06e8aab6ce75fd684c004c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45e045e3974fee56dd06e8aab6ce75fd684c004c/37_0_2790_1674/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The moon village has plenty of parallels with polar outposts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The moon village has plenty of parallels with polar outposts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ESA/Foster + Partners</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The moon village has plenty of parallels with polar outposts. The US McMurdo research centre on the tip of Ross Island began as a handful of buildings in the 1950s. It has now grown to more than 100 structures and a population of 1000 in the summer months. The settlement has an airport, a water distillation plant, sewers and a waste management centre, all needed to support the dormitories, clubs and research facilities. Scientists at the base make space weather observations, study microbes that thrive under glaciers, drill ice cores to obtain 100,000 year records of Earth\u2019s atmospheric greenhouse gas levels, and send out robotic submarines to map the underneath of sea ice.</p> <p>Next year, the US company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/03/us-startup-moon-express-2017-lunar-mission\">Moon Express</a> hopes to land the first commercial spacecraft on the moon. The polar regions are thought to harbour vast reserves of ice that can be melted into water, split into hydrogen and oxygen, and turned into rocket fuel. Bob Richards, a co-founder of the company, has called the moon a \u201cgas station in the sky\u201d. Naveen Jain, the chairman, told the Guardian it is time entrepreneurs had the chance to show what they can do there. \u201cIf ESA wants to enable private enterprises to do what they do best, then I absolutely support it,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>The prospect of turning the moon into a mine may not please everyone, and Crawford says that international legislation around the resources should be strengthened. But he sees no moral objection to mining. \u201cThe reason we have qualms about it on Earth is we are damaging the habitats of other living things we share the planet with. The moon is essentially a dead rock, and it must be preferable to exploit bodies that don\u2019t have any indigenous life on them.\u201d<br></p> <p>Under George W. Bush, Nasa planned to return to the moon and build a permanent polar base. But the plan was shelved by Barack Obama, who explained his decision with a blunt \u201cwe\u2019ve been there before.\u201d Even after the Apollo missions, the idea that Nasa has been there and done the moon is nothing but \u201cthe most superficial geopolitical soundbite,\u201d says Crawford.<br></p> <p>Jeff Hoffman, a former Nasa astronaut, believes humans need to go back to the moon as soon as possible. \u201cIt has been nearly 50 years since we explored a planetary surface and we need to get some experience. The problem with a \u2018moon village\u2019 would be if the infrastructure is so costly to build and maintain that resources for Mars get sucked up,\u201d he says. \u201cPlans for lunar exploration need to be done in a way to enhance our ability to get to Mars, not handicap it.\u201d<br></p> <p>Katherine Joy, a lunar scientist at Manchester University, says that while an international consensus is supposed to exist in the form of the <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/content/just-released-updates-to-the-global-exploration-roadmap\">Global Exploration Roadmap</a>, a clear plan is still needed. \u201cA pathway needs to be decided soon,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is the strength of the moon village concept. It provides an ambitious vision that can bring people together.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cA lunar base isn\u2019t a distraction from our desire to visit and explore Mars,\u201d she adds. \u201cWhat we learned from Apollo is that touch-and-go-style missions are exciting, and scientifically rewarding, but they don\u2019t lead to a sustained human presence on a different world.\u201d <br></p> <p>Exploration and learning how to survive on an alien world is only part of the space game. For decades, missions in Earth orbit and out into the solar system have bound countries together. The International Space Station operates only because Americans, Russians, Europeans and others work side-by-side and trust each other. As Britain prepares to leave the EU, the moon village might do for Europe what politicians could not, Woerner believes. \u201cSpace has the power to join forces in Europe - and even beyond Europe,\u201d he says. \u201cWe should use it for the sake of humankind.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>They are the scourge of the world\u2019s capitals. They flout the law and cost the authorities millions. Yet, like mice, noise and traffic jams, there seems to be little any city can do to protect itself from diplomats. </p> <p>Immunity from prosecution under the Vienna Convention may be a vital part of international relations, but it does little good for the moral fibre of the individuals involved.</p> <p>As of April in Canberra, Australia, diplomats representing various foreign powers owed the city <a href=\"http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/canberras-foreign-diplomats-have-500000-in-unpaid-speeding-red-light-traffic-fines-20160417-go8m9o.html\">more than A$500,000</a> (\u00a3290,000) \u2013 mostly in unpaid parking fines. Tickets for running red lights and speeding were also common. Saudi Arabian diplomats alone owed nearly A$140,000. </p> <p>In New York, meanwhile, the total bill for parking tickets issued to UN diplomats was <a href=\"http://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/140432262249/parking-immunity-diplomats-owe-nyc-16-million-in\">more than $16m</a> (\u00a312.3m) as of March. Here Egypt was by far the worst offender, with a debt of nearly $2m, although more than a third of that was the handiwork of just four cars. One of them \u2013 registration 001 THD \u2013 accrued $109,165 in fines from 1,985 offences, many of which date back to the last century. Since then, with added penalties, the total has more than doubled. Who knows whether the malefactor is still in New York, or even still alive?</p> <p>In London, diplomats failed to pay 4,858 parking fines in last year alone, <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2016-07-21/debates/16072152000034/UnpaidParkingFines\">creating \u00a3477,499 of debt</a> (\u00a3161,328 of which was later waived or paid). The real story here, however, is the congestion charge. <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-07-21/HCWS101/\">Nearly \u00a3100m of congestion charges</a> fees remain unpaid since it was introduced in 2003 \u2013 more than 10% of it from the US embassy. </p> <p>In part, things have reached this stage because of an argument over whether the charge is the price of a service or merely a tax for going in and out of London. Diplomats tend to argue the second, because it just so happens that they are also immune from tax as well as from prosecution. The US reached this view in 2005.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64f50ae4e005094f312931b71651fed4a2be38fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64f50ae4e005094f312931b71651fed4a2be38fb/0_1403_1960_1176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"c\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diplomats failed to pay 4,858 parking fines in London last year alone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey can\u2019t be forced in court to pay a fine,\u201d says a former British diplomat, who asked not to be named, \u201cso there\u2019s no legal redress against them. All that the government or the local authority can do is to try to use persuasion, which, as we all know, doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>No, it doesn\u2019t. But there have been encouraging moments in cities around the world. In 2002, New York achieved a drastic reduction in unpaid fines by refusing to re-register any car with a large outstanding debt. (Since then, though, the fines have gradually crept back up.) The UK introduced a stricter policy in 1985 and in one year reduced the number of annual parking fines not paid by diplomats from 92,285 to 33,904.</p> <p>Even so, such signs of improvement help to simply hide how normal the practice has become. \u201cI suspect that in some cases the parking wardens don\u2019t bother,\u201d says the former diplomat. \u201cIn the past, wardens used to regularly put tickets on diplomatic vehicles, but there was never any belief they\u2019d be paid.\u201d </p> <p>If a diplomatic car is causing an obstruction it can at least be towed away, but drunk or dangerous drivers have to be freed once their credentials have been established. Sometimes this has terrible results. In Ottawa, Canada, in January 2001, a senior Russian diplomat, Andrei Knyazev, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1881488.stm\">lost control of his car</a> on the way back from an ice-fishing party and mounted the pavement, killing one person and seriously injuring another. Knyazev insisted he had not been drinking but would not allow himself to be breathalysed, and the Russian authorities refused to waive his immunity. It subsequently emerged that Knyazev had been stopped for driving drunk twice before, but released. In the end he was prosecuted in Russia and sentenced to four years in prison.</p> <p>This is not an isolated example. A Georgian diplomat, Gueorgui Makharadze, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/09/us/georgian-diplomat-pleads-guilty-in-death-of-teen-age-girl.html?_r=0\">killed a 16-year-old girl</a> while driving drunk in Washington DC in 1997, and was later prosecuted after his government waived his immunity. In 2009, Silviu Ionescu, a Romanian charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires, <a href=\"http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/ex-romanian-diplomat-silviu-ionescu-dies-a-look-back-at-the-hit-and-run-case\">drove into three pedestrians in Singapore</a>, killing one.

After all, a few hundred thousand dollars in lost fines is easy enough for any good-sized city to overlook. Even a few million is probably worth it to New York, when set against the wider social and economic benefits of hosting the UN. No doubt London would like to claim its \u00a396m in lost congestion charges, but diplomats who refuse to pay are hardly putting the city through any meaningful danger or inconvenience. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/26/garden-bridge-pier-55-new-york-london\">Garden Bridge v Pier 55: why do New York and London think so differently?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One way or another, the international community seems resigned to do no more than grumble.

If they think they should move, they move. Alaska has warmed so much that it is causing havoc to a lot of nature.\u201d</p> <p>While most species aren\u2019t able to move as far as terns, scientists are noticing shifts across Alaska. Moose and beavers have moved north of the Brooks Range and onto the Arctic plain, which increasingly offers suitable vegetation as the region <a href=\"http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/reportcard/tundra_greenness.html\">warms up and greens</a>. </p> <p>Red foxes have moved in and have started to outcompete Arctic foxes. A similar thing may happen if the beefy Caspian terns start to push out their smaller cousins. The relationship between grizzly bears and polar bears may be a little more amicable \u2013 as their range starts to overlap there have been reports of a hybrid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/18/pizzly-grolar-bear-grizzly-polar-hybrid-climate-change\">\u201cpizzly\u201d bears in the Arctic.</a></p> <p>But the situation for polar bears is otherwise grim \u2013 they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/14/polar-bears-losing-crucial-sea-ice-study-arctic\">losing life-sustaining sea ice</a> critical for hunting and breeding across the Arctic. They are being forced onto land, where they risk starvation. This desperate scenario is shared with walruses, which have already suffered a 50% drop since the 1980s. In recent years tens of thousands of the tusked beasts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/27/walruses-alaska-arctic-sea-ice-melt\">have had to crowd ashore</a>, with many perishing in stampedes.</p> <p>The melting on land is just as stark. Over the past decade, Alaska has lost 850 gigatonnes of water from its shrinking glaciers, enough to raise the global sea level by 2.9mm. We are living through the fastest Arctic glacier decline in at least 6,000 years, according to Dr Martin Sharp, professor of Earth and atmospheric science at the University of Alberta.</p> <p>\u201cIf the warming trends continue then we expect to see continuous retreat,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cWe are seeing the complete loss of glaciers, areas that had ice caps in the 1950s don\u2019t have them now. That trend will probably increase.\u201d</p> <p>Alaska is being locked into an unhappy cycle of events. As the declining glaciers lose albedo, or reflectivity from sunlight, they absorb more heat and therefore melt further. </p> <p>The vegetation poking through thawing permafrost aids the spread of wildfire which in turn releases more carbon dioxide \u2013 flames have recently licked areas of Alaskan forest previously unburned for thousands of years. The amount of area burned each year in the state is <a href=\"http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/regions/alaska\">expected to double by 2050</a> even if the world acts swiftly on climate change.</p> <p>Summer Arctic sea ice is forecast to winnow away completely by the 2030s, which will be a boon for tourism operators looking to traverse the opening <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/northwest-passage-clear-ice-again-2016\">north-west sea passage</a>.

After record winter warmth, Alaska baked as the season turned to spring \u2013 the temperature from January to April was an incredible 11.3F (6.2C) warmer than the long-term average taken from the 20th century.</p> <p>Still, Alaska and neighboring Canada may well prove a haven for overheated animal species in the future. The state will still be cooler than the lower 48 states and has plenty of wilderness. </p> <p>\u201cThe Caspian tern is a success story in many ways,\u201d said Root. \u201cUnfortunately, many animals won\u2019t be able to move. There\u2019s only so far a salamander can crawl or a gopher tortoise can walk. We stand at the beginning of a mass extinction event. </p> <p>\u201cOne of the most important wildlife corridors runs between Mexico and the US, so Donald Trump\u2019s stupid wall could be a huge problem for nature. At least we won\u2019t have a border like that with Canada, I guess.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>The photo on this story was changed on 23 September 2016. The photo was changed because the original showed a great crested tern, not a Caspian tern; the headline was changed to indicate that the terns were not fleeing to the north of Alaska, rather expanding their migratory area.</li> </ul>",
  "<p>In February, Tomi Lahren had yet another viral moment after she came out swinging at Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Black Panther-themed Super Bowl <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/14/beyonce-profile-black-power-super-bowl-civil-rights\">performance</a>. The Blaze\u2019s up-and-coming TV pundit opened with the view that Beyonc\u00e9 was pushing the notion that \u201cblack lives matter more\u201d. She pressed on with a characteristically acerbic three-minute tirade, referring to Jay Z as a drug dealer and suggesting that if Beyonc\u00e9 wanted to protect black neighborhoods, she could \u201cstart at home\u201d. </p> <p> The video garnered millions of views, delighting her fellow hardline conservatives and outraging the left. She was later invited to reiterate her points on TMZ and in other mainstream outlets well away from the fringes of rightwing media.</p> <p>By June, Jay Z had responded. He dropped a sample of Lahren\u2019s broadcast remarks before his verse on Pusha T\u2019s track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPp7dNDe00U\">Drug Dealers Anonymous</a>. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2O5MGpfKTc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p2O5MGpfKTc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Lahren views it as a feather in her cap. In a phone interview from Dallas, where her show is produced, she says \u201cnot many conservatives can say that they are a rap muse\u201d. </p> <p>Fewer can say that they have been personally called out by Jay Z, but the incident was no fluke.</p> <p>Lahren\u2019s steep, two-year rise from student journalist to national conservative media star has been propelled by her series of combative, widely shared Final Thoughts segments. On a normal day, her videos, pushing familiar conservative positions, get millions of views. But most of her big viral hits have come from putting pop culture under a conservative lens, and leveraging that to talk about the politics of race in the US.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was the girl who eviscerated Obama</p> <footer> <cite>Tomi Lahren</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As she puts it, she \u201cgoes hard at celebrities who use their platform to preach some narrative of social justice\u201d. Just this month, she proved again that her formula works. Her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq0_nyWVXCI \">takedown</a> of NFL star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/12/colin-kaepernick-anthem-protest-monday-night-football\">Colin Kaepernick\u2019s national anthem protest</a> was posted on Facebook on 31 August. At the time of writing, after just three weeks, it had garnered nearly 65m views on that platform alone.</p> <p>Political scientist Dan Cassino, author of a new book on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-American-Politics-Psychology/dp/1138900125\">Fox News</a>, says this willingness to make \u201ca rightwing criticism of pop culture\u201d is one of the things that has so quickly developed Lahren\u2019s profile: \u201cIt is a surefire way to inject yourself into the soft news cycle. That\u2019s a niche that other people haven\u2019t moved into, and she\u2019s done a very good job of that.\u201d</p> <p>Her success is especially striking given that barely two years ago, the only videos she was appearing in were YouTube posts from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPU7k4jQUPE\">The Scramble</a>, the student newscast she hosted at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.</p> <p>Mark Ciavolo was UNLV student body president at the time Lahren hosted the show, and was a regular guest. He\u2019s also a conservative, and counts Lahren as a friend. \u201cShe\u2019s been a consistent conservative voice as long as I\u2019ve known her.\u201d He says her role on The Scramble was more the even-handed host, but her views haven\u2019t changed, even though \u201cthe delivery might vary\u201d. He\u2019s not surprised by her steep, post-collegiate trajectory. \u201cTomi is a very determined, strong woman.\u201d</p> <p>Lahren says her UNLV experience proves that she can do journalism, but that\u2019s not what she\u2019s doing now. \u201cI fully acknowledge that I am not a journalist. I clearly have a point of view, I am very passionate about my point of view. I am a commentator.\u201d </p> <p>Near the end of her degree, in April 2014, she went looking for a journalism internship. The Blaze rejected her application with a form letter. She reached out to the fledgling One America News Network. CEO Robert Herring replied directly, saying they didn\u2019t offer internships but she should come in and \u201cwe\u2019ll see if there\u2019s a job for you\u201d.</p> <p>The audition was successful, and at just 21, she was thrown in at the deep end, running her own show, On Point on OANN, which began in August 2014. <br>\u201cI built it from the ground up, and I learned a lot because I didn\u2019t have a lot of help.\u201d</p> <p>She developed the Final Thoughts segment, and began to think about how it could garner attention beyond the ranks of the channel\u2019s small audience. </p> <p>\u201cI noticed early on that people liked my Final Thoughts, so that\u2019s when we started pulling them and putting them on YouTube.\u201d<br></p> <p>Their quick cuts, discontinuous camera movements, and compression were perfectly pitched to the short attention spans of the social media era. So is Lahren\u2019s forthright outrage. Lahren calls them \u201cdirect, succinct, easy to understand and easy to follow\u201d.</p> <p>In July 2015 she got her first brush with national notoriety, when she criticised Barack Obama\u2019s reluctance to blame Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez\u2019s shootings on a military recruiting centre and navy reserve base in Chattanooga on \u201cradical Islam\u201d. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABrauM7yvco\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ABrauM7yvco?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Lahren\u2019s boyfriend at the time was deployed overseas with the US military, so \u201cit was something that really resonated with me, and I was very angry at the way the media was covering it.\u201d With American flags streaming on a monitor behind her, Lahren said, among other things: \u201cRadical Islam is becoming the rule, not the exception. Yesterday\u2019s moderate is today\u2019s terrorist.\u201d She also called for a redoubled assault on Isis.<br></p> <p>The next morning, her phone blew up.</p> <p>\u201cPeople from high school were texting me and saying \u2018You\u2019re going viral.\u2019 I was the girl who eviscerated Obama.\u201d</p> <p>The video not only demonstrated that Final Thoughts was a winning formula: it brought her to the attention of honchos at The Blaze, Glenn Beck\u2019s post-Fox News conservative media company. Having rejected her as an intern, they recruited her as a rising star.</p> <p>In her new primetime slot, she is still intimately involved with the day-to-day production of the show, and she is dedicated to it. \u201cI don\u2019t have a family, I don\u2019t have a boyfriend. I am in Dallas for one reason only, and that is to do this show.\u201d She makes it back to her home town of Rapid City, South Dakota, only on the biggest holidays. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m very controversial, and I don\u2019t back down from being controversial</p> <footer> <cite>Tomi Lahren</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her senior producer, Jessica Grose, works closely with Lahren. She came to The Blaze from long stints in daytime television, from TMZ to Oprah. She says they\u2019re not just colleagues but close friends. Grose\u2019s political views are less fixed, but she says that when she met her, \u201cI knew that there was something insanely special about her.\u201d Grose\u2019s pop culture chops feed into Lahren\u2019s issue and story selection. </p> <p>Lahren, Grose, and the rest of their small production team are all young women \u2013 unusual in any media company, and a surprise in a conservative outfit. That doesn\u2019t make her a feminist, though. In her view, that movement has been \u201chijacked\u201d, and has become \u201cpassively aggressively anti-men\u201d.</p> <p>This view might seem to contradict her independence and intense ambition. But historically, according to Professor Ronnee Schreiber at UC San Diego, conservative women have often been prominent in holding anti-feminist positions, not only as a movement strategy, but because \u201cit\u2019s a media story, and it helps conservative women get media attention\u201d.</p> <p>When asked to nominate a single quality that explains the speed with which she has become successful, Lahren quickly replies: \u201cFearlessness. I am fearless.\u201d Others who share her conservative views use the same adjective. Ciavolo, her college friend, says Lahren \u201chas been fearless in the way she\u2019s presented her message\u201d.</p> <p>Glenn Beck, her boss for just over a year, says via email: \u201cTomi speaks her mind and is fearless. At this point in history people are looking for people that say what they believe, regardless of the consequences.\u201d</p> <p>Lahren agrees with his analysis: \u201cThere are too many conservatives who are terrified of being labelled. They\u2019re afraid of being labelled and they\u2019re afraid of being not liked. I do not bullshit, I am genuine and authentic. I don\u2019t say these things to go viral or to be controversial, but I say things that a lot of people wish they could say but are fearful of saying.\u201d One of the labels some conservatives shrink from \u2013 and it is one that critics have freely applied to Lahren \u2013 is racist. She says commenters have repeatedly lampooned her as \u201cwhite power Barbie\u201d.</p> <p> It\u2019s undeniable that her notoriety has come from incidents where she has taken on topics related to immigration (she describes herself as a \u201chardliner\u201d on the topic) and anything associated with or inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, which in one segment she compared to the Ku Klux Klan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"baa42aa07bd95a531bd9328442f95481e77ad5a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/baa42aa07bd95a531bd9328442f95481e77ad5a4/5_0_545_551/495.png\" alt=\"Tomi Lahren: \u2018I clearly have a point of view\u2019.\" width=\"495\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tomi Lahren: \u2018I clearly have a point of view.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tomi Lahren</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cassino, the political scientist, thinks that like Donald Trump, Lahren may be both an example and beneficiary of a sea change in the way conservatives talk about race. \u201cThere was an unspoken rule in the conservative movement for a long time, which they learned from Richard Nixon: you do not talk openly about race. It was seen as toxic to talk about it in anything but dog whistles.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty years ago, conservative commentators would talk in code about it, in terms of \u201cwelfare\u201d, \u201cinner city crime\u201d, or \u201cfamily breakdown\u201d. But in the last five to 10 years, Cassino says, \u201cit has become acceptable for conservatives to talk about race in concrete terms\u201d.</p> <p>The election of Obama, for example, led to arguments that talk of racial inequality was overblown, and eventually to criticisms of the president in terms of his racial identity. All of this precisely coincides with Lahren\u2019s formative political years.</p> <p>Like Trump and many other conservatives, Lahren puts this change down to a weariness with political correctness. \u201cFor too long, white people have been told that they can\u2019t talk about race, and that only some people of colour can talk about race. I don\u2019t buy that.\u201d<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t say things to go viral, I say things that a lot of people wish they could say but are fearful of saying</p> <footer> <cite>Tomi Lahren</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She insists that she is not racist, but also that \u201cthere can\u2019t be a group of people in this country who are blamed for the ills of minority communities and then not allowed to speak or defend themselves.\u201d</p> <p>This appeal to white grievances is similar to the one made by the Trump campaign. Even if more conservatives are more willing to talk bluntly about their own racial views, there is still, for their audiences, a frisson in this that gets attention.</p> <p>Lahren has lately become a more enthusiastic supporter of the Republican nominee after her first choice, Marco Rubio, lost. A big motivation is her dislike of his opponent. \u201cI am #NeverHillary all the way down,\u201d she says. \u201cYou may not like what Donald Trump says, but I don\u2019t like what Hillary Clinton does.\u201d Trump\u2019s excesses, she says, are forgivable as the flourishes of a performer. \u201cI\u2019m a performer, too,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Part of that performance is self-presentation, and her appearance is something that has attracted the ire of critics, including, she says, feminists. Certainly, it\u2019s been suggested that she is where she is because of her looks. \u201cI take care of myself,\u201d she says. \u201cDo some people watch me because they think I\u2019m pretty? Maybe, sure. But more are watching because they appreciate what I am saying.\u201d </p> <p>Her gender and age, however, do differentiate her from a sea of middle-aged, male conservative pundits \u2013 the kind of guys Cassino says are a dime a dozen. Just as important are her broadcasting talent and her ability to \u201cseize this political moment\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq0_nyWVXCI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qq0_nyWVXCI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>As to whether Lahren\u2019s moment will last beyond our current political season, one consideration is that The Blaze, her employer, has had well-reported financial difficulties. The subscriber base is small, but it is also suffering from the same problem that led to the departure of Glenn Beck\u2019s still-popular show from Fox News. That is, an inability to attract big advertisers to support programming which is perceived as extreme.</p> <p>Lahren says she is committed to The Blaze, and is full of praise for Beck, but at some point she may be forced to find a new perch. According to Cassino, this may not be easy. \u201cThe messaging she\u2019s doing is going to make it very difficult for her to get mainstream advertisers. Like it or not, what you say on television is dictated by the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble and Chevy,\u201d Cassino says.</p> <p>Especially on issues of race, Lahren is speaking in terms corporate clients might find difficult to associate themselves with. And if she changes her messaging, what happens to her \u201cfearless\u201d and \u201cauthentic\u201d conservative brand? This is not something Beck is worried about. In his email, he added: \u201cAs long as she continues to be authentic, continues to seek knowledge, and is true to herself \u2013 even when she feels compelled to go against the grain, and her audience \u2013 she will be a force to be reckoned with for years to come.\u201d</p> <p>Lahren clearly understands why and how her Final Thoughts videos work. \u201cI\u2019m very controversial, and I don\u2019t back down from being controversial,\u201d she says. She is able to articulate 2016\u2019s conservative anger, and target its sources, in a way that seems fresh. </p> <p>It\u2019s hard to see that anger dissipating, whatever the result of the election, but even if it does, Lahren may be around for a long time. Like American conservatism itself, she is supremely resourceful and adaptable. </p>",
  "<p>Theresa May has told senior commanders that every effort must be made to stop British soldiers from falling victim to \u201cabuse of the legal system\u201d by lawyers representing Iraqis who allege they were victims of war crimes during the occupation of their country. </p> <p>In a 90-minute meeting with senior commanders, the prime minister said she was determined to protect the armed forces against any \u201cvexatious complaints\u201d relating to the eight-year occupation, during which tens of thousands of British soldiers were deployed to the Arab republic. </p> <p>It comes amid mounting criticism of the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (Ihat), which was set up to investigate allegations of murder, abuse and torture by British forces. Former soldiers have claimed they have been hounded through the courts on unfounded claims and there are growing calls for Ihat to be shut down. </p> <p>Reports claim more than 1,200 cases of alleged abuse will be dismissed in the next three months after the collapse of a single law firm, Public Interest Lawyers, after <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/15/public-interest-lawyers-iraq-war-al-sweady-theresa-may-uk-troops\">it was stripped of legal aid funding</a> over a failure to come clean about conflicting evidence in a case against British forces. </p> <p>A Downing Street statement said: \u201cThe prime minister spoke of her pride in the UK armed forces, and praised the work they do to keep our nation safe. She said that every effort must be made to prevent any abuse of the legal system, and restated her determination to protect the armed forces against any instances of vexatious complaints.\u201d</p> <p>But the Law Society, which represents lawyers, hit back, warning that political interference in the legal cases risked undermining \u201cthe independence of the legal profession, the rule of law, and the separation of powers which are fundamental to a strong and diverse society.\u201d</p> <p>Robert Bourns, president of the society, said: \u201cLawyers must not be hindered or intimidated in carrying out their professional duties and acting in the best interests of their clients within the law. They should not be identified with their clients or clients\u2019 cases.\u201d </p> <p>He added: \u201cThe right to access to justice for all depends on lawyers being able to represent their clients\u2019 cases within our framework of laws, no matter how the client or case may be perceived by the public, media or government. The merits of each case are decided by the relevant court, a function that is and must remain separate from government.\u201d</p> <p>In Thursday\u2019s meeting with chief of the defence staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, the Ministry of Defence permanent under secretary, Stephen Lovegrove, the heads of the navy, army and air force, and commander joint forces command, May was briefed on \u201cthe full extent of current operations\u201d, Downing Street said. </p> <p>\u201cThe PM reiterated the UK\u2019s determination to keep Britain\u2019s streets safe by taking the fight to Daesh in Iraq and Syria and noted that we have conducted more than 1000 airstrikes in both countries, second only to the US,\u201d the statement said. </p> <p>She also discussed tackling the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean, the UK\u2019s role in United Nations operations and Nato, collaboration between British and French armed forces and the Navy\u2019s operations against pirates off the Horn of Africa and in sea lanes in the Gulf. </p> <p>May said: \u201cThe men and women of our armed forces do an incredible job, often making huge sacrifices to keep us safe. Whether taking the fight to Daesh in Iraq and Syria, helping to tackle the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean or providing flood relief at home \u2013 we owe them a huge debt of gratitude.</p> <p>\u201cOur armed forces are the best in the world and with the biggest defence budget in Europe and the second biggest in Nato we will continue to play our part on the world stage, protecting UK interests across the globe.\u201d </p> <p>The Conservative MP Johnny Mercer, a member of the defence select committee, who is heading an investigation into Ihat, has branded the legal pursuit of troops \u201ca national disgrace\u201d and called for the team, which was set up in 2010, to be axed. This month, Mercer claimed that May\u2019s predecessor, David Cameron, had wanted to shut down the investigations, only to be overruled by the attorney general. </p> <p>The Birmingham-based Public Interest Lawyers had submitted hundreds of allegations of misconduct and unlawful killing by British soldiers, including triggering the \u00a331m <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/al-sweady-inquiry\">Al-Sweady inquiry</a> into the conduct of British troops in a 2004 firefight with insurgents. </p> <p>However, it was subsequently accused of sitting on evidence that undermined its clients\u2019 claims in that case for a year, before withdrawing their claim. It was criticised when the inquiry\u2019s 2014 report concluded the most serious allegations of war crimes following a 2004 battle in southern Iraq were based on \u201cdeliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility\u201d.</p> <p>It was announced in August that the firm would no longer receive public funding after the legal aid agency ruled it had breached contractual requirements. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

Even more worrying is the damage being done to our values by a referendum that has divided the nation and stoked fear and hatred.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/get-serious-labour-rebels-deal-with-brexit-catastrophe\">Get serious, Labour rebels, and deal with the Brexit catastrophe | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Centre-left parties must put tribalism and factionalism to one side, and urgently work together to make the case for a progressive exit from the EU. Their vision needs to meet the concerns and anxieties of Brexit-voting northern post-industrial towns without losing the internationalist outlook of the centre-left remain voters.</p> <p>This is challenging, but far from impossible given the deep ideological divide that runs through the Brexit constituency itself. To undermine the fear and hatred, we need a message of hope, of security and of solidarity. And we need to get real about the best tactics to achieve this. At Global Justice we have set out a <a href=\"http://www.globaljustice.org.uk/brexit-red-lines\" title=\"\">series of red lines</a> that would from the basis of a progressive vision of leaving the EU.</p> <p>First, progressive parties need to admit that the conversion of social democracy to free market economics in the 1990s was a political disaster that fed Brexit. In an article this week, Stephen Kinnock MP declares that the problem for centre-left values is that they\u2019ve been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/cure-divided-britain-managed-immigration-work-permits\" title=\"\">too lax on immigration</a>. This gets everything upside down \u2013 the problem is the privatisations, the corporate-backed trade deals, the competition over low tax rates that was remorselessly pushed here and abroad, and which left working-class communities hollowed out, and individuals abandoned to the mercy of the market.</p> <p>So we urgently need to create hope by proving another sort of economy is possible. Here, the public is to the left of most centre-left politicians. While politicians have largely supported a new corporate trade offensive, including US-EU trade deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/transatlantic-trade-partnership-ttip-canada-eu\" title=\"\">TTIP</a>, the public has opposed it. It\u2019s time for the British opposition to unequivocally oppose TTIP\u2019s sister agreements, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/30/ttip-trade-deal-agreements-ceta-eu-canada\" title=\"\">Ceta</a>, the Canada-EU deal due to be ratified this winter, and Tisa, a super-privatisation trade deal that would lock in privatisation and liberalisation of services from finance to transportation.</p> <p>Let\u2019s put something progressive in their place: economic relationships based on building up public services fit for the 21st century, on long-term investment, on sharing skills and technologies, on prioritising the realisation of low-carbon, better educated and skilled jobs, with sustainable demand driven by well-being not debt.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s security. Our economy breeds precarious jobs, breaks community bonds and runs down public services. The resulting fear and individualism turns people against one another \u2013 and against those who are \u201cdifferent\u201d most of all. Regulation, where it challenges unfettered market power, is an antidote to this insecurity.</p> <p>Anti-corporate regulation would be welcomed by many families, consumers, workers, minorities. Or small-scale farmers, who should be protected from the end of the Common Agricultural Policy by a fairer subsidy system. But progressive parties must battle to reclaim the language around regulation \u2013 as we have on tax \u2013 so that is not a symbol of \u201cunfreedom\u201d but a democratic means of social, and environmental, protection.</p> <p>Here, progressive politicians will come across as rational, and undogmatic next to trade secretary Liam Fox, who told parliament last week that he wants a \u201clow-tax and low-regulation\u201d economy. Or next to Theresa May, who continues to threaten to exit the European Convention on Human Rights, something that would leave us in a category with Belarus. Or next to Andrea Leadsom, said to believe in replacing agricultural support with an \u201cinsurance\u201d system that makes farmers more dependent on financial markets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/cure-divided-britain-managed-immigration-work-permits\">My cure for a divided Britain? A programme of managed immigration | Stephen Kinnock</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s the internationalism, most prized by many progressive remain voters, that is the toughest nut to crack, but if communicated as part of a single agenda with hope and security, we can win people back. And we need to do this because ditching freedom of movement will not preserve domestic harmony and an international outlook. It would, rather, fuel demands for a harsher migration system, a further clampdown on refugees, an increase in racism, and increase in Ukip\u2019s vote.</p> <p>In theory, free movement can be the most progressive aspect of our economy, treating people, wherever they\u2019re from, as human beings with equal worth. It allows people an escape from poverty, unemployment and governments they don\u2019t like. The EU\u2019s treatment of migrants is an international disgrace. But the solution is to gradually extend that freedom \u2013 not stop it altogether.</p> <p>So rather than ditch free movement of people to preserve the free movement of capital, as the mainstream remain campaign is now doing, we must do the opposite. Big business must be controlled and regulated. And the poorest should not pay the price for these principles. Perhaps, rather like universities, migrants come to an area accompanied by investment, meaning the appearance of migrants means all lives getting better.</p> <p>How to achieve this? Time is not on our side, and we need to be realistic; the best and perhaps only way to prevent an immediate rewriting of our constitution on the worst terms possible is joining the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/28/the-norway-option-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-mean-for-britain\" title=\"\">European Economic Area (EEA)</a>. There are as many problems with the EEA as there are with the EU, and one additional one, which is that we don\u2019t even get a seat at the negotiating table. But the alternative is a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, which would give the current government a free hand to abolish our protections, introduce immigration controls, and embed the \u201cmarket knows best\u201d mantra into every aspect of our lives.</p> <p>The political tide is currently flowing against the EEA, and only a concerted and unified campaign by progressive politicians will reverse this. The window is closing on this tactically vital act of damage limitation.</p> <p>If progressive forces fail to create a vision that resonates with significant portions of leave and remain voters, the future is very bleak indeed \u2013 a free-trade, low-tax, low-regulation economy, with opposition coming not from the left, but from an increasingly insular economic nationalism fuelled by the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/27/arron-banks-the-millionaire-hoping-to-bankroll-uk-into-brexit\" title=\"\">Arron Banks</a>.

  "<p>In a dusty expanse of desert in eastern Kenya sits the world\u2019s largest refugee settlement, the place I call home.</p> <p>The camp was <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2008/aug/27/somalia-international-aid-and-development\">set up in 1991</a> to house Somalis fleeing the civil war. At first, there were three settlements: Ifo, Dagahaley and Hagadera. Ifo II and Kambioos were later added. They are all generally called Dadaab, named after the nearby town 50 miles (80km) from the Somali border.</p> <p>Half a million people are estimated to live here. My family are among them. They arrived in Ifo in the early 1990s; I was born in 1996. </p> <p>I grew up and completed high school here in 2014, and I hope to start university soon.

In 2012, closing the camp was mooted due to \u201ceconomic concerns\u201d, and last year, the Kenyan deputy president, William Ruto, said Dadaab would be shut within three months, although this never happened.</p> <p>From the attack on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/westgate-mall-attacks-kenya\">Westgate shopping mall</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/kenya-attack-survivors-garissa-al-shabaab\">slaughter at Garissa</a> University College, the Kenyan government has long blamed Somali refugees for insecurity, but for people in the camp, the most recent announcement feels like the most serious yet. The government disbanded the department for refugee affairs and politicians are keen to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/kenya-seaside-look-peaceful-murderous-war-al-shabaab\">appear in control</a> of national security, with a presidential election coming up next year.</p> <p>It is true that security has become an issue here. There is one main dusty road that runs through Ifo. I used to go there as a child to watch the cars drive past at exactly 8am, every day, etched with UN letters, carrying workers to their field offices. Today, it is almost dormant. </p> <p>Two Spanish aid workers from Doctors Without Borders were <a href=\"http://www.catalannewsagency.com/society-science/item/the-two-spanish-msf-workers-kidnapped-in-kenya-21-months-ago-are-released\">kidnapped in October 2011</a> and there have been multiple explosions over the years. Cars no longer move without a heavy security escort or following a predicable schedule. </p> <p>Other things have also changed. The playground where I played football is now occupied by people living in tents. The narrow path I walked to school is a graveyard and the hospital I attended as a child lies in ruins.</p> <h2><strong>What happens to us?</strong></h2> <p>The government has said we should return to Somalia voluntarily. This week, it <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-refugees-idUSKCN11R270\">asked the UN</a> for financial support, but has not disclosed many details on how our return can happen quickly and humanely. </p> <p>The UN refugee agency has a plan. UNHCR suggests that refugees awaiting resettlement in a third country, and those not originally from Somalia \u2013 about 30,000 people \u2013 should be rehomed at the Kakuma refugee camp, about 450 miles from Nairobi. </p> <p>It says 42,000 people living in Dadaab are registered Kenyan nationals and should be reintegrated into local communities. The remaining 170,000 refugees must return to Somalia.</p> <p>My family are in the first category. The UN opened a resettlement case for us in 2004 and we were supposed to go to live in the US. We attended the necessary medical examinations 17 times, but our flight never arrived.<br></p> <p>We suspect fraud. Maybe someone sold our slot and a different family went on it. This does happen.</p> <p>\u201cWait, be patient,\u201d is what I was told when I contacted the resettlement support centre, but 12 years is a long time to hold out. My father has given up; he says we should return to Somalia. But I was born here, in Kenya \u2013 a country that doesn\u2019t accept me.</p> <p>People in Dadaab are reacting to the threat of closure differently. Some, such as Hawa Abdi, 23, have gone back to Somalia of their own accord. I spoke to the mother of three children in Ifo II a week before she left in July. She explained that she had fled Sakow in 2011 after the devastating drought in Somalia. </p> <p>Abdi had heard that rainfall was predicted for her home town. \u201cIf Kenya doesn\u2019t want us, why should we stay here?\u201d she asked. </p> <p>But for Fatuma Mohamed, 44, a long-term resident of Ifo, this is home. Mohamed fled Somali in 1991 and has since married and had eight children here. \u201cThe land we had in Somalia has long been taken away and we don\u2019t have a place to return to ... I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said, speaking at her polythene-thatched home with a kitchen made out of twigs.</p> <p>Mohamed Issack, 20, who grew up in Dagahaley, dreams of being accepted by his host country. \u201cI would have loved to be a Kenyan and free to live in any part of this country ... but that is not an option for me,\u201d he said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/asadhussein_/status/738851697192259588\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Who has the courage to stand at the place where they were born and not cry?

Humanitarians know that. The families and friends that we leave behind know that.

There is no safety when attacks are met with silence. When a colleague and I were in South Sudan last November, we heard of several recent violent attacks against aid workers. Despite clear confirmation of the incidents, none were reported or condemned publicly by the political leadership. The incidents became security anecdotes \u2013 devoid of humanity, dismissed as rumour. Impunity for prior attacks, the weakness of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan as a protection force, the negative local public campaign against NGOs, and the relentless intimidation of humanitarians were not the only factors, but all contributed in their own way to the Terrain incident.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70f503852730d0fc45a2802e67651bb6e6510608\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70f503852730d0fc45a2802e67651bb6e6510608/0_308_5068_3040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aid is seen strewn across the floor the morning after a convoy delivering aid was hit by a deadly air strike.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aid is seen strewn across the floor the morning after a convoy delivering aid to Aleppo was hit by a deadly air strike.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Omar Haj Kadour/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During my last trip to the border of Syria in May this year, my colleagues and I met with NGOs carrying out cross-border programmes.

No one wishes misfortune on any family. In fact, I\u2019d like to think I share in this family\u2019s happiness. They have overcome a system that otherwise would have treated them as merely numbers.

Yes, they hail from the other side of the planet but really, they might as well, pardon the pun, be neighbours.</p> <p>If this post-Brexit referendum story tells us anything, it is that there is room for foreigners in this country, but only if they are people like \u201cus\u201d.

  "<p>BP is proposing to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight using plans that fall a long way short of industry best practice and would not be allowed in some other regions, according to an expert in oil spill disasters.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Andrew Hopkins, emeritus professor at the Australian National University, has researched BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://theconversation.com/bp-in-the-bight-why-the-planned-oil-spill-response-is-too-slow-to-protect-the-coast-65945\">Writing in the Conversation</a> he said it was \u201cby no means obvious\u201d that BP had reduced risks of a spill in the Bight to as low as reasonably practicable, which is the requirement under Australian law.</p> <p>BP has proposed to drill for oil inside a commonwealth marine reserve in the Great Australian Bight. Its first two environmental plans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/17/bp-application-drill-oil-in-great-australian-bight-rejected-for-second-time\">were rejected</a>, after the regulator found they did not meet its requirements.

But, if that failed, it would drill a \u201crelief well\u201d, which would intersect with the one spilling oil.

Earlier estimates from the company <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/25/bp-would-need-to-bring-equipment-from-texas-to-contain-south-australia-oil-spill\">suggested it would take 157 days</a>.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.bsee.gov/sites/bsee_prod.opengov.ibmcloud.com/files/federal-register-notice//2016-15699.pdf\">new US regulations</a> for drilling in the Arctic require a relief well to be drilled and completed within 45 days. To achieve that, the company must have access to a nearby rig.</p> <p>BP has not said it will have its own rig nearby in the Bight. Instead, it would borrow one from another company. But it is unclear where such a rig would come from, since there are no other rigs in the Bight.</p> <p>Hopkins told the Guardian it also wasn\u2019t clear how quickly another company could release a rig for this purpose.</p> <p>\u201cThe Gulf of Mexico blowout was stopped in 87 days, during which time it inflicted <a href=\"http://www.cchbooks.com.au/disastrous-decisions-the-human-and-organisational-causes-of-the-gulf-of-mexico-blowout\">damage worth at least $40bn</a>. Who knows what the toll would have been if it had lasted almost twice as long?\u201d</p> <p>Before drilling a relief well, BP would try to cap the blowout using a a \u201ccapping stack\u201d, a new piece of equipment designed after the Gulf of Mexico disaster.</p> <p>BP has previously said it would rely on shipping a stack from Singapore to the Bight, which would take <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/25/bp-would-need-to-bring-equipment-from-texas-to-contain-south-australia-oil-spill\">32 days</a>.

BP has said subsea dispersal would begin within 10 days \u201cwhere that is possible\u201d but oil could reach the coast within 9.2 days.</p> <p>\u201cIts published oil spill response plan gives no guarantee that an oil spill in the Bight would not reach the shoreline and damage the environment,\u201d Hopkins said.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for BP said: \u201cIn the very unlikely event that there was a well incident, we would take action immediately, starting from within seconds. There are lots of parallel activities that we would mobilise, such as starting dispersant injection or surface recovery, at the same time as capping the well.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema) is a technically credible, strong and independent regulator overseeing a world-class regulatory system. The \u2018objectives-based system\u2019 used by Nopsema requires companies including BP to identify and appropriately manage risk; this system ensures each activity is assessed based on its circumstances, instead of the one-size-fits-all approach taken in some other countries.\u201d</p>",

you\u2019re not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you\u2019re watching on television,\u201d Trump said in remarks to the Shale Insight Convention in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p> <p>The remarks were ad-libbed during a longer section of Trump\u2019s address in which he declared that his presidential administration would have \u201cno compassion\u201d for \u201clawless conduct.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCrime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cOur job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the African American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children a great education.\u201d</p> <p>When asked earlier this week how he would prevent violence in African American communities, Trump called for <a

We will all be arrested for this movie.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cNow, to be fair, Mel also said, a little more eloquently, that, \u2018Every human being has hundreds of separate people living inside his skin. And the talent of a writer is his ability to give them their separate names, identities, personalities and have them relate to other characters living within him.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Other medal recipients included poet Louise Gl\u00fcck, composer Philip Glass and historian Isabel Wilkerson, author of The Warmth of Other Suns, and celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, who pulled out of Trump\u2019s new Washington hotel over his anti-immigrant comments.</p> <p>Obama added: \u201cWe also honour Wynton Marsalis, who unfortunately could not make it here today, and Morgan Freeman, who undoubtedly is off playing a black president again.

The questions in Trump\u2019s survey include whether he should refer to his opponent as \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d onstage \u2013 and here are a couple more:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d09bbecb68a15f3887a700293e0945435c70148d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d09bbecb68a15f3887a700293e0945435c70148d/0_0_856_669/500.jpg\" alt=\"trump debate Qs copy\" width=\"500\" height=\"391\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">trump debate Qs copy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trump screen grab</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-22T16:50:39.166Z\">at 5.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e406b5e4b0fcb95da8f95b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-22T16:33:15.987Z\">5.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Clinton camp: Trump's Russian holdings represent conflict of interest</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Following a bombshell ABC News report on Donald Trump\u2019s business dealings in Russia and former Soviet states, which you can watch below, the Hillary Clinton campaign has released a statement saying that Trump\u2019s \u201calarming financial ties present a possible motive for his otherwise puzzling pro-Putin policies.\u201d</p> <p>Here\u2019s the Clinton camp statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite his effort to hide his business dealings, we now know that Donald Trump has profited from hundreds of millions of dollars from Russian interests. These alarming financial ties present a possible motive for his otherwise puzzling pro-Putin policies such as his openness to lifting sanctions against Russia that currently inhibit money making opportunities for corporations like the Trump Organization. This is precisely what more than fifty national security experts warned against when they called on Trump to disclose and divest his conflict-laden foreign assets that could endanger America\u2019s national security. Unless Donald Trump immediately details all his business connections with Russia and every other foreign nation, we will never know what is driving his decision making: the interests of the American people or his own bottom line.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here\u2019s the ABC News report:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0DMOBBOJ0U\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D0DMOBBOJ0U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e403fce4b052c716b30dfe\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-22T16:23:07.404Z\">5.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump county chairwoman apologizes, resigns</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The chair of the Donald Trump campaign in Mahoning County, Ohio, who said in a filmed interview with the Guardian that Barack Obama started racism and went on about African Americans and \u201cgenerations still having unwed babies\u201d and \u201cwhen do they take responsibility\u201d \u2013 she has resigned.</p> <p>The Trump campaign has released a statement calling the comments \u201cinappropriate.\u201d</p> <p>The chairwoman, Kathy Miller, released a statement: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My personal comments were inappropriate, and I apologize.

Because, as the White Queen admitted: \u201cWhy, sometimes I\u2019ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.\u201d</p> <p>The three authors, including Dr John Cook, of the University of Queensland, look at both rhetorical and scientific arguments put by deniers. </p> <p>One example is the popular theme that casts \u201csceptics\u201d as \u201cdissenting heroes\u201d who bravely oppose \u201cpolitical persecution and fraud\u201d. You know, like modern-day Galileos. </p> <p>But the authors write that deniers will also try and convince the public that there is no consensus among scientists about the causes of climate change (there is and it\u2019s us). They write:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Either there is a pervasive scientific consensus in which case contrarians are indeed dissenters, or there is no consensus in which case contrarian opinions should have broad support within the scientific community and no fearless opposition to an establishment is necessary.</p> </blockquote> <p>The authors unleash similar jujitsu-style logic on other contradictory arguments and give examples of where the same individuals have apparently argued against themselves.</p> <p>One of the authors\u2019 examples of incoherent logic comes from the Australian geologist and mining industry figure Prof Ian Plimer and his 2009 book, Heaven and Earth \u2013 a book favourably cited by the likes of the former prime minister Tony Abbott and Cardinal George Pell.</p> <p>On page 278, Plimer writes that \u201ctemperature and CO2 are not connected\u201d but, on page 411, writes that \u201cCO2 keeps our planet warm\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think that people who deny basic science will continue to do so, no matter how contradictory their arguments may be.</p> <footer> <cite>Stephan Lewandowsky</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>According to the authors, their examples of \u201cincoherence\u201d only hold together in the minds of the deniers if you apply types of glue known as \u201cconspiracist ideation\u201d and \u201cidentity-protective cognition\u201d.</p> <p>So what\u2019s that all about? </p> <p>Conspiracist ideation, or conspiratorial thinking, is the tendency to entertain suggestions: for example that Nasa and the Bureau of Meteorology are conspiring to deliberately manipulate temperature data just to make global warming seem worse than it really is, rather than to correct for known issues.</p> <p>An example of \u201cidentity-protective cognition\u201d in this case, the authors explain, is where people who advocate for small governments and \u201cfree markets\u201d face a dilemma. </p> <p>Accepting the scientific consensus would likely see increased levels of regulation, which challenges their identity as free-market advocates. So instead, the authors argue, the only options open are to either deny the consensus or try and discredit it.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Because cutting GHG emissions requires interventions \u2013 such as regulation or increased taxation \u2013 that interfere with laissez-faire free-market economics, people whose identity and worldview centres around free markets are particularly challenged by the findings from climate science.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lead author Prof Stephan Lewandowsky, an expert in cognitive psychology at the University of Bristol, has written several research papers finding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/jul/08/climate-denial-linked-to-conspiratorial-thinking-in-new-study\">links between the rejection of science, \u201cconspiracist ideation\u201d</a> and the belief in free market economic principles. </p> <p>One argument that deniers may try with this <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-016-1198-6\">Synthese</a> paper is that climate scientists also contradict each other and have offered several explanations for the supposed global warming \u201cpause\u201d or \u201cslowdown\u201d (this was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2014/feb/12/global-warming-fake-pause-hiatus-climate-change\">never really a thing</a>). </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/apr/26/climate-scientists-are-now-grading-climate-journalism\">Climate scientists are now grading climate journalism | Daniel Nethery and Emmanuel Vincent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lewandowsky told me:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Phenomena can have multiple explanations \u2013 so, for example, it is entirely conceivable that volcanic activity and heat exchange with the ocean though the La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon might have contributed to what has been called a \u201cslowdown\u201d in warming. Similarly, just because contemporary climate change is driven by CO2 does not mean that the sun could not have caused earlier episodes of climate change. The same phenomenon may have multiple causes \u2013 but the same cause cannot have contradictory consequences. For example, it would be ridiculous to say that the alleged \u2018slowdown\u2019 was driven by La Ni\u00f1a but that La Ni\u00f1a also causes warming. Equally, it cannot be the case that CO2 causes warming as well as cooling. But CO2 as well as La Ni\u00f1a may both contribute to global temperatures.</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, Lewandowsky and his colleagues are by no means the first to see the many contradictory arguments from deniers. But does he think looking at them in such detail will make any difference? </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that people who deny basic science will continue to do so, no matter how contradictory their arguments may be. However, these pervasive contradictions should caution the media against giving an airing to those opinions.</p> </blockquote>"
