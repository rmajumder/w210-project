She couldn\u2019t afford to have the doctor treat both of them, so she handed over her baby.<br></p> <p>Although Reid and her daughter were both ill, the GP would bulk bill for only one of them and Reid, a Weilwan woman from Gulargambone, didn\u2019t have the money to pay for herself.</p> <p>At that time, 20 years ago, the cost of medical treatment was not just a problem for the Indigenous population of Nambucca Valley, in New South Wales. It was a problem for everyone in the area who had to go through the humbling process of having to ask to be bulk-billed at surgeries that did not advertise their billing policies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/20/young-female-and-determined-how-millennial-social-entrepreneurs-are-changing-the-world\">Young, female and determined: how millennial social entrepreneurs are changing the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bulk billing \u2013 where the bill gets sent straight to Medicare \u2013 was given at the \u201cgrace and favour\u201d of local doctors and their staff.

Bawrunga is one of a growing number of social enterprises founded by Indigenous women.</p> <p>The program manager of Indigenous business education at the University of NSW, Rebecca Harcourt, says there is a flowering of Indigenous-led social enterprises. \u201cThere has always been some incredible commitment and leadership around community organisations,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea of Indigenous business is not a dirty word any more \u2013 whether that is social enterprise or big business. Business and social enterprise is a way in which you can mobilise change.\u201d</p> <p>A social enterprise is defined as a commercially viable business existing to benefit the public and the community, rather than shareholders and owners. It also dedicates at least 50% of its profits to its mission.</p> <p>Bawrunga is self-sustaining, is set up as a not-for-profit and has bought its premises at Nambucca Heads.</p> <p>The service employs 43 people and has about seven Aboriginal people working in ancillary services such as reception, Aboriginal health work and building maintenance. \u201cIt does bring the community together,\u201d says Reid. \u201cIt gets rid of that [racial] division there. We are working towards trying to close that social gap,\u201d she says, adding that a lot of the doctors were born overseas. \u201cIt is also a very multicultural service.\u201d </p> <p>\u201c[Bawrunga] started from nothing. Not one cent. We started from a passion, a vision, and we started to grow it into an actual profitable service.\u201d</p> <p>Harcourt says the proliferation of Indigenous owned-and -run enterprises has been assisted by the Indigenous business directory <a href=\"https://www.supplynation.org.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supply Nation</a>. \u201cI think there has been real momentum and that is through technology and connecting.

It is getting them out and about and moving and keeping them fit as well. </p> <p>\u201cIt brings opportunities for them to come together. There is a lot of isolation out there in communities.\u201d</p> <p>Tjanpi provides skill development workshops and engages senior women to teach younger girls. Young says there are up to 800 women involved and, each year, about 400 will produce something to sell.</p> <p>Nancy Jackson in Warakurna, one of the weavers, makes a basket every day, earning a few hundred dollars a week. \u201cShe then uses that money to go to the store and buy food and that would be on the table for dinner that night.\u201d</p> <p>Some women make only a couple of bowls a year for extra cash, but there are also artists involved in major works and collaborations, creating works for institutions, exhibitions and art awards.</p> <p>Tjanpi sells the products to galleries and the sales price is split equally three ways between the maker, Tjanpi and the retailer.</p> <p>\u201cThe costs of goods out in communities is extremely high,\u201d says Young. Tjanpi helps them make their money go further by providing bush gear such as crowbars and blankets at cost price.</p> <p>Young says Tjanpi relies on government and philanthropic funding, but 40% of its income comes from the sale of art works. \u201cTjanpi will always be somewhat dependent on external funding for its operations, but we also bring much more than simply economic returns \u2013 there are social and cultural benefits that we bring into these communities and great health and wellbeing benefits to these women.</p> <p>\u201cSo we are not ashamed of our somewhat dependence on government funding, just because the price point for baskets is quite small and our cost of service delivery is extremely high,\u201d she says.</p>",
  "<p>The number of EU students applying for places on some of the most sought-after courses in the UK\u2019s leading universities has dropped by 9%, according to Ucas, which administers university entry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/25/brexit-may-force-15-of-staff-at-uk-universities-to-leave-warns-group\">Brexit fears may see 15% of UK university staff leave, group warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The data applies to a limited number of courses with an earlier application deadline of 15 October but the marked decline in interest from EU students will lead to fears about the damaging impact of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote on the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/22/uk-universities-mull-eu-campuses-in-new-era-of-uncertainty\">UK\u2019s universities</a>.</p> <p>The data was published on Thursday and relates to applications for all courses at Oxford and Cambridge universities, as well as applications for medicine, dentistry and veterinary courses elsewhere, beginning in September 2017.</p> <p>Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/\">Universities UK</a>, said the full picture would only become clear after the main January deadline, which usually makes up 90% of total applications. But she linked the decline in applications to uncertainty over government financial support for EU students. \u201cThis fall does, however, highlight the importance of ensuring that prospective European applicants are made fully aware of the fees and financial support arrangements well in advance of the applications window,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe Ucas process for accepting applications for 2017 opened on 6 September but the government guarantee on fees and financial support for EU students for 2017 entry was not provided until 11 October, only days before the October deadline. To avoid future uncertainty, we need the government to extend these transitional arrangements now for EU students considering applying for courses starting in 2018. These prospective European students will soon be starting to consider whether to apply to study at British universities.\u201d</p> <p>Just days before applications closed this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/11/eu-student-funding-in-uk-to-remain-same-in-2017-despite-brexit-vote\">the government finally issued a statement</a> reassuring EU students hoping to begin their studies next year that they would continue to be entitled to the same terms and conditions as home students, with \u00a39,000 fees and access to the student loan book for the duration of their studies.</p> <p>Many in the sector complained the intervention was too late and are now urging the government to eliminate future uncertainty for potential students from Europe by extending the offer further.<br></p> <p>The 9% decline brings to an end the recent trend for increasing numbers of EU applications to UK universities. Numbers applying for courses governed by the 15 October deadline have dropped by 620 to a total of 6,240 \u2013 reversing an 8% increase at the same point last year and a return to 2015 levels.</p> <p>Contrary to the overall trend, Oxford University said it had seen a 1% increase in applications from EU students and a 4% increase overall to more than 20,000 for 2017 entry, with international applications up too. A spokesperson said: \u201cWhile there has been understandable uncertainty around the implications of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, we are confident that students from the EU continue to see Oxford as a welcoming and attractive option for undergraduate study.\u201d</p> <p>Cambridge University reported a decline in applications from EU students, down from 2,652 last year to 2,277 this year, in the context of an overall increase in applications to 16,875.</p> <p>A university spokesperson said: \u201cWe are disappointed to see a reduction in EU undergraduate application numbers on last year, which reflects the considerable uncertainty felt by these students due to the EU referendum. But we still received more applications from the EU this year than we did in 2012, and Cambridge remains an attractive place for EU students to study.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The total number of applicants for places in this round of applications has gone up 1% since last year, with figures for international students holding up, despite uncertainty about future visa arrangements and warnings from the Home Office of a clampdown.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cIt is too early in the application cycle to predict reliable trends. But the overall increase in applicant numbers is positive \u2013 and suggests even more students will be able to benefit from higher education next year.\u201d</p> <p>Mary Curnock Cook, Ucas chief executive, also welcomed the overall increase in applications. \u201cThis is an encouraging increase in applicants to the October deadline courses, particularly given the 2% decrease in the 18-year-old population. We will be watching the numbers of EU applications in the run-up to the January deadline, especially now that the government has confirmed arrangements for continuing access to student loans for 2017 courses.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group, said the latest Ucas figures were broadly back in line with where they were in 2014. \u201cWhile it is too early to know the reasons for the decline, we would be concerned if EU students were deterred from applying to our world-class universities because of Brexit.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Theresa May is not the first politician to have been caught out saying one thing to an audience of bankers and another to voters. Earlier this month Hillary Clinton, the US presidential candidate, was revealed to have taken $675,000 to speak at Goldman Sachs where she adopted a friendlier, more pro-business persona than that offered to the American public. On this side of the Atlantic the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/exclusive-leaked-recording-shows-what-theresa-may-really-thinks-about-brexit\" title=\"\">unearthed an audio recording</a> of a previously undisclosed private question-and-answer session the prime minister had with Goldman Sachs bankers this May on the defining issue of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe. In a wide-ranging discussion the PM went beyond her current gnomic utterance to voters that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d. The then home secretary showed in private that she was more committed to staying in the European Union than the tepid support she gave to the remain campaign. Her most revealing exchange is her stark warning that corporate outlays in the UK would be at risk if the country left Europe. <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2016/04/theresa-mays-speech-on-brexit-full-text.html\" title=\"\">Yet a month earlier in her only major speech she blamed \u201cdiscrimatory EU policies\u201d</a> for the threat to investment in a post-Brexit Britain.</p> <p>It is an irony that in the cloistered preserve of Goldman Sachs, a temple of power and privilege, normally guarded politicans lift the veil of caution. We must be thankful for small mercies. In private to bankers Mrs May said if we voted to leave, European business would make rational decisions about the size of the EU trading bloc, and leave Britain. In public she blamed such decisions on Brussels for discriminating against Britain. Jeremy Corbyn, who missed a trick to hammer home this point at prime minister\u2019s questions, later correctly identified Mrs May\u2019s Janus-like pronouncements. The questions raised by the Goldman Sachs tape are clear: Does she believe now what she said then? If not, why not? The evidence is mounting that she was right to point to stormy times for a Brexit economy in the years ahead. A new <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/pressing-the-reset-button-the-public-finance-options-facing-the-new-chancellor-at-the-autumn-statement/\" title=\"\">analysis by the Resolution Foundation</a> finds that the economy is likely to shrink by \u00a360bn, most of this down to leaving Europe.</p> <p>This smaller Brexit nation would be characterised by lower average earnings, higher inflation and 600,000 fewer jobs in 2020. No wonder the chancellor, Philip Hammond, is fighting a rearguard action to maintain access to the single market. The study says he will be staring at an \u00a384bn hole in the public finances. Mr Hammond knows his room for manoeuvre is tight \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36864099\" title=\"\">that he will have to fudge or break George Osborne\u2019s rules</a> on spending and debt as a proportion of GDP to ensure the motor of the economy does not stall. No doubt leading Brexiters will drop their ideological objections to a looser fiscal position so that extra taxpayers\u2019 cash can be spent to keep the engine ticking over as the gears shift to a post-European economy.</p> <p>The wider macroeconomic picture is criss-crossed by unpromising circumstances. The politics turns <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37710786\" title=\"\">towards a harder Brexit</a>: outside the single market, with maximum control over immigration. The economics would be costly: raising questions over whether London can maintain its position as a major hub for financial services across the EU. The UK\u2019s position as <a href=\"http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/gbr/\" title=\"\">the ninth-largest exporter in the world</a> is threatened. Curbs on EU migrants, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/05/eu-migrants-uk-gains-20bn-ucl-study\" title=\"\">who pay more in tax than they take out in benefits</a>, may strain public finances. How to resolve such contradictions remains a puzzle even to those involved at the highest level of government, as the leaders of the devolved assemblies found on Monday.</p> <p>Unlike other remainers, as home secretary Mrs May failed to vigorously defend Britain\u2019s EU membership. Her one speech was a Eurosceptic explanation of why, after considering the pros and cons, she thought it was best to vote remain. In that speech on the crucial question of the British economy she played up her Euroscepticism. This has helped to set a direction of travel for Britain\u2019s economy that she herself condemned to Goldman\u2019s bankers. Why did Mrs May say one thing in private and another in public?</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May has come under intense criticism from politicians across the UK and Europe after it emerged that she had warned of the dangers of Brexit in a private talk at Goldman Sachs a month before the referendum vote.</p> <p>The prime minister was accused by a string of MPs, headed by Jeremy Corbyn, of ignoring her own concerns about the risks of leaving the single market, as revealed in her remarks to City bankers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/exclusive-leaked-recording-shows-what-theresa-may-really-thinks-about-brexit?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">that were leaked to the Guardian on Tuesday night</a>.</p> <p>In Germany, politicians from both governing parties accused May of failing to show leadership.

To British \u201chard Brexiters\u201d, it is the opposite, a Trojan horse for socialist bureaucracy and external control. To the latter, the Wallonian fiasco proves only how useless the EU has become. If it wants a trade deal with post-Brexit Britain, it should set its house in order and then come cap in hand to London. Otherwise, Britain should shake hands with Canada and others round the world, and let Europe stew in its own juice.</p> <p>So far, so noble. I can see Boris Johnson and Liam Fox stomping the Ardennes, arm-in-arm with Walloon Marxists in defence of plucky little Belgium. Theirs is a coalition of the last stand against the heartless armies of the EU. What a contrast with the leaders of Britain\u2019s Wallonias, Scotland and Wales, who last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/24/brexit-strategy-scotland-wales-northern-ireland-direct-line-david-davis-theresa-may\" title=\"\">traipsed to Downing Street</a>, pleading for Brexit mercy from Theresa May. If Wallonia could stop Europe in its tracks, what about the equally oppressed tribes of the Celtic fringe? They got a flea in the ear.</p> <p>The Wallonian saga shows only the power of provincial lobbyists in ruling the terms of trade, both within and outside the EU. No one can seriously applaud the licence granted to the Walloons to shut out the Canadians. Even in Brexit Britain, leavers and remainers alike favoured free trade. Their chief argument was over \u201ctrade in what, and with whom?\u201d</p> <p>That argument at least is starting to clear. On intra-European migration, May will be forced to concede virtually an open door to bankers, doctors, care workers, fruit pickers and other businesses dependent on foreign labour. It is simply not feasible to erect visa barriers round the UK\u2019s borders, whether along the Channel coast or around Fermanagh and Tyrone. Whatever May says, Brexit is unlikely to make much difference to migration statistics. Her leadership should start lowering expectations.</p> <p>On trade in manufactured goods, the&#xa0;totals at stake are small, but not so for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ce78f36-ed2e-11e5-888e-2eadd5fbc4a4\" title=\"\">80% of businesses that are services</a> and particularly affected by <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/249969/TaskForce-report-15-October.pdf#page=17\" title=\"\"> non-tariff barriers</a>. While the EU market in services remains embryonic, to stay must be in Britain\u2019s interest. Everyone wants access to markets. Everyone accepts, and May concedes, that this means give and take. Give involves a surrender of control. There is no such thing as absolute sovereignty.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Political Europe is in the process of decline, if not disintegration</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In June the British voted narrowly to leave the EU. Barring a revolution, that will plainly happen. But beyond \u201cleaving\u201d, all is pollster conjecture. \u201cHard\u201d Brexit posits some EU relationship along Canadian lines. But even if a deal with Britain may be treated as more urgent, Wallonia shows how pressure groups can damage the public interest. In Britain\u2019s case, transitional \u201cdefault to World Trade Organisation\u201d tariffs would be costly to the economy and, on the Irish border, unenforceable.</p> <p>Any Brexit cloud has a silver lining. Taking the heat out of London\u2019s banking frenzy may be no bad thing. Devaluation can ease the strain of tariffs. Pending a storm of Wallonias \u2013 Germans on banking, the Dutch on pigs, half the EU on car assembly \u2013 ad hoc deals may be reached. But a cloud it would surely be. In the short term, there would be a net loss of business. Hence I cannot see how hard Brexit is in the nation\u2019s interest, political or economic. The virtue of the residual <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea\" title=\"\">European economic area</a> (EEA) \u2013 some version of the so-called Norway option \u2013 is that it would take Britain out of the EU politically, but leave in place a common market. Trade in goods and services would remain, but at the price of their regulation, and that would have to be paid for.</p> <p>Political Europe is in the process of decline, if not disintegration. As refugees, bank bailouts, recession and unemployment all testify, the EU and especially the eurozone are not a functioning confederation but a zone of German influence. Britain has decided to distance itself from that zone. It cannot divorce itself from the economy of its entire continent. Caution and common sense advise the EEA, \u201csoft\u201d Brexit.</p> <p>Meanwhile, do not mock the Walloons. Their flexing of political muscle reflects a widespread identity crisis among all the world\u2019s subordinate regions. From Scotland to Spain, from Ukraine to Turkey to Syria to the Gulf, the greatest threat to global stability \u2013 and its ally free trade \u2013 is sub-national separatism. The rebellion of local peoples against centralist power is everywhere.</p> <p>As Brexit stumbles forward, May should read the lessons of Wallonia. She&#xa0;should appease the Scots and others by granting them status in her impending negotiations. She is a remainer at heart. She may welcome a Wallonian card in her hand.</p>",

After winning the ball in their own half through the tackling of the centre-forward Tost\u00e3o, Brazil essayed a series of languid passes in midfield before feeding the ball to Clodoaldo, who dribbled exquisitely past four Italian players to give Rivellino an opening down the left flank. Rivellino swiftly moved the ball further down the wing to Jairzinho, who cut inside to draw in two opponents before sliding the ball across to Pel\u00e9, who was just outside the penalty box.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/25/carlos-alberto-dies-brazil-captain\">Pel\u00e9 and Franz Beckenbauer lead tributes to \u2018brother\u2019 Carlos Alberto</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the move built up to a thrilling crescendo, Pel\u00e9 sensed Carlos Alberto crashing in on the overlap from his right-back position, and waited for a crucial half-second to deliver a perfectly weighted pass to his skipper. Carlos Alberto hit the ball so hungrily and with such power that both feet came off the ground, yet he lost no control in doing so, and his shot flew with absolute accuracy across the angle and along the ground into the bottom left-hand corner of the goal, giving the goalkeeper no chance. It was a joyous, tear-welling, celebratory finish to a marvellous game, and was testimony to the ability of that Brazilian side to raise football to an art form.</p> <p>\u201cI realise how beautiful and how important that goal was, because everybody is still talking about it,\u201d he<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/brazil/4759831.stm\"> told the BBC many years later</a>. \u201cNobody talks about Pel\u00e9\u2019s goal, the first goal, the second goal.

I think it was the best goal ever scored in a World Cup.\u201d</p> <p>Carlos Alberto Torres was born in Rio de Janeiro, and joined the city\u2019s Fluminense team at the age of 19, in 1963. Though a defender, he immediately caught the eye with the range of his play \u2013 including his reading of the game, leadership skills, dribbling, ball control and passing. Those all-round abilities won him the first of his 53 Brazil caps within a year, yet to general surprise he was not picked for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jul/24/1966-world-cup-final-conspiracy-refereeing-50-years\">1966 World Cup</a> squad. Brazil\u2019s gifted team were knocked out of the 1966 finals in the group stages, after which a new managerial regime not only brought Carlos Alberto back into the fold, but, judging that a collection of strong-willed players needed greater direction and backbone, chose him as captain with a brief to put the team back on track.</p> <p>That he did, in spades, delivering the 1970 World Cup at the age of 25 in a tournament celebrated for some superb football and competed for by a number of excellent sides, including England, West Germany and Italy. Carlos Alberto could not, however, follow up with the 1974 World Cup, which he missed due to a bad knee injury, and though at 32 he was again selected as captain of Brazil in the qualifiers for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/quiz/2011/jun/14/1\">1978 World Cup</a>, he had to move to centre-half to compensate for a loss of speed, and decided to retire from international football before the finals, having played only five matches for his country since 1970.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/09/-sp-a-century-of-the-selecao-the-remarkable-story-of-brazilian-football\">A century of the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o: the remarkable story of Brazilian football</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Domestically, after three years and almost 100 appearances at Fluminense, he had left his home city to join Pel\u00e9 at Santos in 1966, playing more than 400 games there before 1974, when he returned to Fluminense for a successful three-year stint. After a brief period with the Rio club Flamengo, in 1977 he made a lucrative move to the US to sign for New York Cosmos, where Pel\u00e9 was also playing. Apart from a short fling with the California Surf team, Carlos Alberto remained with the Cosmos from 1977 to 1982, winning three North American Soccer League titles before retiring there.</p> <p>Within a year he was back in Brazil, managing Flamengo. He lasted two years in that job, and over the next two decades there followed head coach posts with 15 other teams, including Fluminense, Miami Sharks in the US, and, on the international scene, Oman and latterly Azerbaijan, where he finished his managerial career in 2005.</p> <p>On his death Carlos Alberto was living in Rio, where he was still working as an entertaining and forthright sports commentator who rarely held back on his assessment of players or the game in general.</p> <p>He is survived by his third wife, Gra\u00e7a Garbaccio, and by two children, Alexandre (a former footballer who made a single appearance for Brazil, in 1992) and Andr\u00e9a, from his first marriage.</p> <p>\u2022 Carlos Alberto Torres, footballer, born 17 July 1944; died 25 October 2016</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2016.

  "<p>Vladislav Surkov was the mysterious Kremlin puppet master who wrote rock lyrics and loved Tupac Shakur yet was simultaneously the chief architect of Vladimir Putin\u2019s system of \u201cmanaged democracy\u201d. </p> <p>Now, after some time on the sidelines, Surkov is well and truly back in the thick of Kremlin intrigue after a cache of emails purporting to show his office coordinating affairs in separatist east Ukraine was leaked online.<br></p> <p>Sanctioned and thus banned from travel to the EU for his role in the Kremlin\u2019s Ukraine policy, the 52-year-old Surkov nevertheless popped up at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/ukraine-peace-process-leaders-agree-roadmap-to-revive-talks\">recent four-way negotiations</a> in Berlin over Ukraine, sitting at the round table next to Putin, and just one seat across from Angela Merkel. It was a very visible signal of Surkov\u2019s importance to the Kremlin\u2019s controversial Ukraine policy.</p> <p>Several sources have told the Guardian that Surkov has on occasion made secret trips to Donetsk, technically still part of Ukraine, to bring local separatist politicians into line and tell them what is expected of them if they are to continue to receive Russian funding and support. More regularly, emissaries from east Ukraine come to Moscow to meet with Surkov. <br></p> <p>On Tuesday, a giant cache of emails purporting to be from Surkov\u2019s office, some of which allude to his role in managing Russia\u2019s relations with the separatist entities in east Ukraine, was leaked by a Ukrainian outfit calling themselves the CyberJunta. The Kremlin has suggested the leak is a fake, though at least part of it appears to be real. It is possible that going after Surkov is the first salvo in what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/russian-hacking-us-retaliation-cyberwar-international-treaty\">the CIA promised</a> would be \u201cunprecedented cyber covert action against Russia\u201d in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">alleged Russian hacking</a> of the Democratic party\u2019s computer networks.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d4331e8c3048804170b3f4be9babdd575239ca9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d4331e8c3048804170b3f4be9babdd575239ca9/0_0_2999_2361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Putin and Vladislav Surkov.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"787\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Putin and Vladislav Surkov.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexei Nikolsky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed the email account as a fake, saying Surkov never used email. The hacked emails, however, do not purport to be from Surkov\u2019s personal account, but from an account run by an aide. It received messages for Surkov which were presumably then passed on. While there is no guarantee some of the mails have not been doctored in some way before release, much of it appears to be genuine. The hackers released photographs of the passports of Surkov and his children, apparently as further proof the hack was real.<br></p> <p>Mark Galeotti, senior researcher at the Institute of International Relations in Prague, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible, but unlikely that Ukrainian hackers would be able to break into Surkov\u2019s government email account and download a huge collection of files from 2014. Given that the Americans have been hinting at a response, I cannot help but wonder if this was a US government shot across Putin\u2019s bows, a warning that it also has the capability to intrude and embarrass and a willingness to use it if Russia persists.\u201d<br></p> <p>Galeotti said it was possible Ukrainian proxies had been used to cover the tracks. This could explain why the 2014 emails were released alongside what looked like a crude forgery, supposedly a current Kremlin plan to destabilise Ukraine.</p> <p>Surkov is a unique character in Putin\u2019s Kremlin. Unlike many of the yes men and former security officials who surround the Russian president, he first came to prominence as a marketing man for Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the oligarch who would later be jailed for a decade. In 1999, he moved to the Kremlin. He almost never gives interviews, and has been shrouded in mystery over the years.</p> <p>During Putin\u2019s first decade, Surkov was known for coordinating the \u201cmatrix\u201d of Russian politics, cultivating fake opposition parties and funding pro-Kremlin youth groups. He personally curated what was allowed on to Russia\u2019s television screens, and was seen as the architect of \u201cpost-truth politics\u201d where facts are relative, a version of which some have suggested has now taken hold in the west.</p> <p>In 2011, a Russian photographer released an <a href=\"http://varlamov.ru/347515.html\">extraordinary photo essay</a> from Surkov\u2019s Kremlin office, revealing that he had portraits of, among others, Che Guevara, Barack Obama and Tupac Shakur. He also had a bank of old-school white telephones with dozens of buttons bearing the surnames of the most powerful people in Russia.</p> <p>He usually wears a faint, knowing smile and there is just a hint of Mr Bean about his appearance. While he wears sharp suits in the Kremlin, he will occasionally appear on his wife\u2019s Instagram feed <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BF_L0XQAKbg/?taken-by=natan_d\">wearing edgy outfits</a> that say \u201ccontemporary artist\u201d more than \u201cKremlin apparatchik\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe likes writing and poetry; he thinks in a non-standard way. He has a rounded personality that despite his abstract modes of thinking is very capable of tackling serious state tasks,\u201d said one source who has worked closely with Surkov. </p> <p>Surkov is widely believed to be the real author behind the pen name Natan Dubovitsky, who has written a postmodern novel and a number of short stories. In March 2014, a short story attributed to Dubovitsky called Without Sky was published, set in an imaginary future where the planet was engulfed in \u201cworld war five; the first non-linear war\u201d. </p> <p>One passage read: \u201cThe simple-hearted commanders of the past strove for victory; now, they were not so stupid. Of course, some of them acted like before and tried to retrieve the old worn-out slogans, like \u2018Victory will be ours\u2019. Sometimes it worked. But mostly, they understood war as a process; part of a process, its most acute phase, but maybe not its most important phase.\u201d</p> <p>Less than a week after the story was published, the annexation of Crimea was completed. </p> <p>Surkov\u2019s initial fall from grace came back in 2011, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/01/medvedev-stay-russian-president\">Russian elite was split</a> between those who wanted to see the relatively liberal Dmitry Medvedev stay in the Kremlin for a second term, and those who wanted Putin to return. In an uncharacteristic misstep, Surkov backed the wrong horse, and let it be known in elite circles that he was firmly in the camp that wanted to see Medvedev given the chance for another term. </p> <p>When Putin came back, Surkov was edged out, and after a period as deputy prime minister, seemed to be a spent force. He later returned, but was put in charge of relations with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two Russian protectorates essentially annexed from Georgia. It was hardly a glamour job, and was a spectacular step down from directing the entire Russian domestic political scene. </p> <p>But as Russia was drawn into a clandestine war in east Ukraine, Surkov has gradually risen to a position of prominence again; both his experience in managing relations with the Georgian protectorates and his talent for intrigue and subterfuge made him the perfect person to run the Kremlin\u2019s relations with the \u201cpeople\u2019s republics\u201d that sprang up in east Ukraine and were essentially coordinated from Moscow.</p> <p>Surkov has not yet commented on this week\u2019s hack. When he was put on the US sanctions list for his role in the Ukraine events back in 2014, he likened it to \u201cgetting an Oscar for best supporting actor\u201d and said it made him happy. \u201cThe only things that interest me in the US are Tupac Shakur, Allen Ginsberg and Jackson Pollock. I don\u2019t need a visa to access their work. I lose nothing,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>He was also placed on the EU sanctions list, although Time magazine <a href=\"http://time.com/4476005/vladislav-surkov-putin-athos-greece-sanctions/\">reported</a> he was spotted at an Orthodox monastery in Greece earlier this year, and he then popped up very publicly alongside Putin in Berlin.</p> <p>\u201cI am too odious a person for this brave new world,\u201d said Surkov, with characteristic irony and ambiguity, back in 2011 when he was removed from his post in the presidential administration. <br></p> <p>Now, it seems he fits right in again.</p>",
  "<p>My father, Dimitri Petrohilos, who has died aged 81, was an architect and furniture designer.</p> <p>The son of an architect, George Petrohilos, and his wife, Elli (nee Georgiadis), Dimitri was born in Athens. His family lived in their cellar when the German army occupied their home during the second world war. After the war, they settled in Tanzania, where Dimitri rode camels, rallied cars, hunted in the bush and crash-landed a Tiger Moth, in a tree. He created his first building, a church, with his father.</p> <p>After taking a sculpture course in Florence, Dimitri applied widely to study architecture and in 1953 went to the University of Cincinnati. He revelled in all that 1950s America had to offer a handsome Greek in a pink zoot suit. He travelled through Mexico to Cuba, where he recalled meeting Fidel Castro; he also ran into Elvis Presley at Radio City in New York, he told us. An outspoken and avid reader of communist material, he came to the attention of the House Un-American Activities Committee and in 1955 left the US, initially for Canada.</p> <p>In 1956 he returned to his family in Dar es Salaam and joined his father\u2019s firm. Four years later, he moved to London to study at the Architectural Association and work for Booty Edwards &amp; Partners. Using his expertise honed in the tropics, he was the project architect on the new Standard Chartered Bank headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, an elegant concrete building that towered above the developing city but is now dwarfed by its neighbours.</p> <p>Returning to Tanzania in the late 60s he worked for the architecture consultancy firm Norman and Dawbarn, where, among many other buildings, he designed Nkrumah Hall for the University of Dar es Salaam. In 2003 it appeared on the newly designed 500 shilling banknote, and in 2015 the Tanzanian government decreed it a national heritage site.</p> <p>Like many architects, Dimitri became fascinated with designing furniture. In the mid-60s he founded Adeptus, initially with a studio and shop in Primrose Hill, north London, then on Tottenham Court Road and elsewhere in London, and also sold in the US. Eventually there were 19 stores worldwide. He was obsessed with simplicity and economy of material, developing foam furniture to create designs such as the Bedsit and the Duo chair.</p> <p>In 1979 he<strong> </strong>founded Estia Designs, continuing a modular flat-pack approach to office and studio furniture. He invented and patented innumerable ingenious clips and hinges, and dreamed of furniture made up of infinitely configurable components, to give the customer complete control over what they bought.</p> <p>My father told stories to rival those of Homer and in explaining the gentle curvature of the Parthenon steps he inspired me to become an architect too.</p> <p>Dimitri is survived by his third wife, Julia (nee Thomas), whom he married in 2012; by two daughters, Elli and Daphne and a son, Alexi, from his first marriage, to Poppy (nee Kazamia), which ended in divorce; by a daughter, Zoe, from his second marriage, to Jill (nee Syrett), which ended in divorce; and by me, his son from a previous relationship with Naomi Games.</p>",

Only five countries were found to have met their 2015 targets: Denmark, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Sweden and UK.</p> <p>Seamus Jeffreson, Concord\u2019s director, called on EU states to stopping inflating aid with spending that, he said, had dubious development impacts. \u201cThis is particularly true when it comes to refugee costs \u2013 an area where EU member states have a moral duty to do their part, but without diverting aid budgets,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The shape of EU aid last year was heavily influenced by the refugee crisis, said the report. More than a million refugees claimed asylum in Europe in 2015, prompting many EU states to apply an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development rule allowing member countries to count certain refugee-related expenses as ODA for a year after their arrival.</p> <p>The study anticipated that the looming EU departure of the UK, one of the union\u2019s biggest and best-performing donors, would affect British and EU aid budgets, diminishing their effectiveness. </p> <p>Concord added that the political shifts behind Brexit may also empower domestic anti-aid critics, putting greater pressure on the UK\u2019s aid budget and the pledge to spend 0.7% of national income on aid.</p> <p>The report welcomed political recommitments on the latter, but said the British government\u2019s stance was challenged by \u201clacklustre aid effectiveness implementation and shrinking engagement with UK civil society\u201d. </p> <p>It added that the UK\u2019s new ODA strategy, launched at the end of 2015 with a renewed emphasis on national interest, called into question how effectively UK aid could deliver on its core purpose of poverty reduction and sustainable development.</p> <p>\u201cIncreasing amounts of UK aid will be spent by government departments and cross-government funds other than the development ministry, the Department for International Development (generally considered a good performer on aid effectiveness), and this may undermine the quality of UK aid,\u201d said Concord.</p>",

  "<p>Mexico City is in the mood for a fiesta and clearly has no intention of doing it by half. That Formula One has arrived in town is impossible to miss \u2013 the posters, the promotion and the beaming local fans are all too obvious. Better still there is a buzz \u2013 a throbbing sense of excitement and anticipation that is unique to venues where passion for the sport far outweighs crass commercialism or political agendas.</p> <p>On Wednesday, while the teams were unpacking in the paddock, Mexico City was revelling in their arrival, as well it might. Amid the exaggerated caterwauling of the doom-mongers fearful of dropping attendances and viewing figures, this weekend\u2019s race is part of an almost unparalleled success story from which F1 would do well to learn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/01/nico-rosberg-wins-mexican-grand-prix-f1\">Nico Rosberg leads home Lewis Hamilton to win F1 Mexican Grand Prix</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/01/nico-rosberg-wins-mexican-grand-prix-f1\">After an absence from the calendar of 23 years</a>, the Mexican Grand Prix returned last year with a bang. That the race was a dead rubber in the championship mattered not a jot to the fans and 134,850 of them packed the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez. Only Silverstone could boast a bigger attendance in 2015 and then only by a few thousand. More impressively, the numbers could have been higher. The circuit is located in a public park \u2013 limited both by space and by having the equivalent of listed status \u2013 so organisers were unable to construct more grandstands.</p> <p>To put the figures in perspective, the attendance at Bahrain in 2015 was 32,000; in Malaysia 44,611. It is what has happened here in Mexico City in 2016 that really stands out, however. New tracks traditionally suffer a second year drop-off on being added or returning to F1. Austria, for example, had a disastrous 20% fall in 2015 after coming back in 2014. In contrast, Mexico is already 99% sold out again and the numbers are set to be up on last year.</p> <p>History has its part to play in this passion for F1 \u2013 the circuit is named in honour of the brothers Rodr\u00edguez. In 1961, in his first race at Monza, Ricardo was the youngest driver to qualify on the front row \u2013 a record he held until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/01/max-verstappen-ferrari-f1-sebastian-vetttel-kimi-raikkonen\">Max Verstappen bettered him</a> at Spa this year \u2013 and raced for Ferrari in 1961 and 1962, taking best finishes of fourth and sixth from six races and a second at Le Mans in 1960. He was killed aged only 20 at his home grand prix in 1962 when the suspension on his Lotus 24 failed on the high-speed banking of the Peraltada \u2013 the awe-inspiring and daunting turn now truncated for safety purposes.</p> <p>His elder brother Pedro was even more successful, winning two grands prix, in South Africa and at Spa during an eight-year career in F1. He also won Le Mans in 1968, one of many victories in sports cars and was acknowledged as a master in the wet. Tragically he too died in an accident, at the Norisring in Nuremberg, in 1971. Both were formidable drivers and are still revered in Mexico, while the interest they engendered in the sport is palpable today.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/oct/28/f1-mexico-gp-guide-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-autodromo-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59k6f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2849109\"            data-video-name=\"F1 Mexico GP guide: everything you need to know about the Aut\u00f3dromo \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58133323e4b0219a00d39946\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028F1MexcioGPCircuitGuide_KP-30362987_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028F1MexcioGPCircuitGuide_KP-30362987.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028F1MexcioGPCircuitGuide_KP-30362987_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/oct/28/f1-mexico-gp-guide-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-autodromo-video\">F1 Mexico GP guide: everything you need to know about the Aut\u00f3dromo</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The presence of two Mexican drivers on the grid \u2013 Sergio P\u00e9rez and Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez is, of course, also a factor, but not one that can be taken for granted.

But May deliberately included a strong attack on the European convention on human rights, knowing it would be widely, but inaccurately, portrayed as evidence of being a secret Brexiter at heart regardless of the fact the ECHR has nothing to do with the EU.</p> <p>Since becoming prime minister May has had to accept the result of the Brexit vote. In the process she has recalibrated her public rhetoric on Brexit by qualifying the need for British companies to have \u201cthe maximum freedom to trade and operate in the single market\u201d by saying it must not be at the expense of \u201cgiving up control of immigration again\u201d. She has also promised Britain will not accept rulings from the EU\u2019s European court of justice.</p> <p>These carefully calculated shifts in language have led some to conclude she is now set on the path to hard Brexit. But her private Goldman Sachs speech just five months ago makes clear that she personally believes a future out of the single market means a business exodus from Britain. </p> <p>Perhaps she should spell out her views about hard Brexit to the British people rather than giving American bankers the inside track.</p>",
  "<p>The road on which Theresa May currently finds herself is well travelled. Most successful politicians rely on a kind of necessary deception, projecting authenticity and credibility while conducting business in the only way that political business can be conducted: by negotiation.

But at neither event did she suggest, as she did in her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-speech-tory-conference-panel-verdict\">conference speech earlier this month</a>, that curtailing free movement must take priority over membership of the single market, nor advocate, as her home secretary did, that employers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas\">count their foreign workers</a>, or that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/zero-chance-eu-citizens-keep-same-rights-post-brexit-expert\">fate of EU citizens in Britain </a>might be a matter for negotiation. Quite the opposite in fact: in her on-the-record speech in April, she actually said that while free movement rules make it harder to control European immigration <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/home-secretarys-speech-on-the-uk-eu-and-our-place-in-the-world\">\u201cthey do not mean we cannot control the border\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Since 23 June, Mrs May has said scarcely a kind word about the EU. This is not necessarily dishonourable: her rhetoric has been aimed at persuading the 52% who voted leave that she feels what they feel. She is marching to their tune. A consequence of the binary choice of a referendum as opposed to the choice between programmes offered by a general election is that it appears to deliver a single message that politicians are obliged to honour. We are all learning how to manage the consequences.</p> <p>That is more or less the official line from No 10 this morning, in the wake of the Guardian\u2019s story about her private speech: \u201cWe are working to make a success of this new opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>But this is no way to rebuild the confidence of voters in the good intentions of politicians. May is overinterpreting the result, using it to construct headlines and justify policies that are not borne out by the subsequent analysis of the no vote \u2013 which shows that it was neither exclusively among poorer people, nor mainly motivated by anti-migration sentiment \u2013 and then using it to promote division. This is not leading, it is following.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>May is establishing herself as one of the most evasive of modern prime ministers. This is a lethal electoral strategy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Healing the divisions that the referendum exposed does not mean acting as if all the right was on one side. That is democracy as the tyranny of the majority. Often, it is clear that May does really understand that. On the steps of Downing Street as the new prime minister in July, she began by acknowledging the kind of institutional injustice that makes people feel powerless, and she talked persuasively of an economy that works for all. That is the tone of voice that the post-referendum country needs.</p> <p>May is already establishing herself as one of the most evasive of modern prime ministers. The psychologist Peter Bull <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/theresa-may-has-a-very-special-technique-for-avoiding-questions-67424\">describes her as a sphinx-like equivocator</a>, author of a new technique of never giving a specific answer to a direct question. This is a lethal electoral strategy.</p> <p>The Theresa May who talked to the smart kids at Goldman Sachs a couple of months earlier might have allowed her audience to influence her tone of voice. She might have thought that her words would remain unreported. But I think that was the authentic Theresa May. She should remember that authenticity is the quality voters most value. And she should reframe her message about Brexit to reflect her real concerns before she leads a car-crash departure with all the miserable consequences that she foresaw when she was talking the truth to the city slickers.</p>",

When a TV crew confronted him earlier this year, Gunnlaugsson looked so pained that Edward Snowden&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/716751158937686018\">tweeted his facial expression</a>&nbsp;as a gif.</p>\n     <p>The anti-establishment Pirate party has risen on a subsequent wave of public anger directed at Iceland's political elite. After Iceland's disastrous 2008 banking collapse, the Panama Papers leak was for many the last straw.&nbsp;</p>\n    </div> \n   </figure> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This time around, analysts say it could win between 18 and 20 seats. This would put it in pole position to form a government at the head of a broad progressive alliance of up to five parties currently in opposition. </p> \n<p>The party\u2019s leader and figurehead is Birgitta J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, a 49-year-old feminist MP, poet, artist and former WikiLeaks collaborator. J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir says she has no ambition to be prime minister, pointing to the Pirate party\u2019s horizontal structure. Rather, she wants to sweep away what she sees as Iceland\u2019s dysfunctional system. </p> \n<p>\u201cPeople in Iceland are sick of corruption and nepotism,\u201d <a href=\"http://birgitta.is/92-2/\">she has said</a>. She likens Iceland to <a href=\"https://newint.org/features/2015/01/01/democracy-digital-era-keynote/\">a chilly North Atlantic version of Sicily</a>, ruled by a few \u201cmafia-style families\u201d plus their friends, whom she nicknames \u201cthe Octopus\u201d. </p> \n<p>Of her political movement, she says: \u201cWe do not define ourselves as left or right but rather as a party that focuses on the systems. In other words, we consider ourselves hackers \u2013 so to speak \u2013 of our current outdated systems of government.\u201d<br></p> \n<p>This anti-establishment message has resonated with large swaths of Iceland\u2019s 320,000-strong population, especially the young. On Monday J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir and two party colleagues <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/58zq55/we_are_the_icelandic_pirate_party_leading_the/\">took part in an AMA</a>, or \u201cask me anything\u201d, on Reddit. Their wide-ranging discussion covered the EU (the Pirates would put Iceland\u2019s membership application to a referendum), fishing quotas, whaling, climate change and the party\u2019s name.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re called the Pirate party in reference to a global movement of Pirate parties that popped up over the last decade,\u201d parliamentary candidate Sm\u00e1ri McCarthy explained. \u201cDespite our name, we\u2019re taken fairly seriously in Iceland, in particular because of our very aggressive anti-corruption stance, [and] our pro-transparency work.\u201d</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_parliamentary_election,_2016#Opinion_polls\">poll last week</a> put the Pirates, who hang a black pirate flag in their parliamentary office, on nearly 21% of the vote. This is far short of the 40%-plus it was polling at the height of mass anti-government protests this spring, but enough to leave a combination of it and the Left-Green party, on 19%, just 10 points short of a majority.<br></p> \n<p>The Pirate party has <a href=\"http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2016/10/17/iceland_s_pirates_gun_for_anti_government_grand_all/\">ruled out</a> any possibility of forming a coalition with either of the current two ruling parties, the centre-right Independence party and centrist Progressive party. It says it hopes to form a pre-election alliance with supportive parties so voters can \u201cknow what their vote will mean\u201d. </p> \n<p>All too often in Icelandic politics, the party says, electoral pledges are reneged on after elections, with \u201cthe parties forming a government \u2026 hiding behind compromises in coalition \u2013 enabling them to cheat voters again and again\u201d.</p> \n<p> Saturday\u2019s election was prompted by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/iceland-prime-minister-resigns-over-panama-papers-revelations\">resignation of Iceland\u2019s prime minister</a> Sigmundur Davi\u00f0 Gunnlaugsson. He became the first major casualty of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\">Panama Papers</a> in April after the leaked legal documents revealed he and his wife had millions of pounds of family money offshore. Gunnlaugsson hadn\u2019t declared the British Virgin Islands company. </p> \n<p>This was not illegal, but the news sparked outrage and some of the largest protests that Iceland has ever seen. The ruling coalition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/06/icelandic-mps-call-for-fresh-elections-after-pm-resigns\">replaced Gunnlaugsson with the agriculture and fisheries minister Sigur\u00f0ur Ingi J\u00f3hannsson</a> and promised elections before the end of this year.</p> \n<p>Gunnlaugsson\u2019s Progressive party is now languishing at about 8% in the polls, barely a third of its score in the 2013 elections. Support for the Independence party, the Pirates\u2019 rival for the position of largest party, seems to be holding.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"947b13170e6ddcee9ec87fb62cbacdefb8a92d05\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/947b13170e6ddcee9ec87fb62cbacdefb8a92d05/624_93_2736_1642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Birgitta J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Birgitta J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Knox/Tim Knox (commissioned)</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, the Pirates\u2019 parliamentary leader, has said her party is willing to form a government with any party that subscribes to its agenda of \u201cfundamental system change\u201d, including the introduction of a new, crowdsourced national constitution. </p> \n<p>It strongly advocates greater protection for whistleblowers. Its first ever bill proposed back in 2013 was on granting Snowden asylum. J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir attracted international attention in 2010 when she worked with Julian Assange on a leaked video which revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/05/wikileaks-us-army-iraq-attack\">US helicopter pilots killing two Reuters journalists on the streets of Baghdad. </a></p> \n<p>Built on the belief that new technologies can help <a href=\"http://piratar.is/en/core-policy/\">promote civic engagement and government transparency and accountability</a>, the Pirates also advocate an \u201cunlimited right\u201d for citizens to be involved in political decision-making. It wants voters to be able to propose new legislation and decide on it in national referendums.<br></p> \n<p>The Pirate party is part of a global anti-establishment trend typified by parties on the left such as Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain, and on the right such as Germany\u2019s AfD and Britain\u2019s Ukip. As well as promising to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, Iceland\u2019s Pirates have pledged to maintain the country\u2019s economic stability. </p> \n<p>Iceland has recovered economically since the 2008 crash, when Iceland\u2019s three biggest banks collapsed; owing 11 times the country\u2019s GDP. Reykjav\u00edk\u2019s stock market fell 97% and the value of the krona halved. Helped by a tourism boom \u2013 2.4 million visitors, nearly seven times the country\u2019s population, are expected in 2017 \u2013 economic growth is forecast to reach 4.3% this year, and unemployment has fallen to just over 3%.</p> \n<p>Unlike some other anti-establishment parties, the Pirates have made clear they have no intention of doing anything likely to upset the economy.

In fact, I used to help maintain it. It was set up in 1990 by Phil Clarke, who worked at BT in Martlesham (near Ipswich) when the web was still very much experimental. He then passed it on (1993-1995) to Paul Felton, who was a student at UEA in Norwich (boo, hiss). </p> <p>\u201cAfter Paul graduated, he passed it on to me, as I was, at the time, a PhD student at Warwick (1995-1996). Paul then took it back in 1996, and ran it until 2001, when the club finally woke up to the potential of the web, and got a local company called AWS to run it \u2026 There used to be some discussion with Sheffield United fans about our claim to primacy, but I believe that it was decided in our favour.\u201d</p> <p>As for unofficial websites \u2026 \u201cVery likely to be Reading\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.royals.org/\">Hob Nob Anyone</a> which has been knocking around since November 1994,\u201d reckons Peter Sorrill. \u201cAlthough the distinction between \u2018official\u2019 and \u2018unofficial\u2019 was moot in the early 90s as most clubs weren\u2019t that tech savvy.

The theme to Tetris originated from a Russian folk song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W80xBX0jK-c\">Korobeiniki</a>, about a peddler and a girl haggling over goods, it says here. The basic tune has popped up on football terraces in a few places, starting in Chicago.</p> <p>\u201cSection 8, the supporters\u2019 group for Chicago\u2019s MLS team, the Chicago Fire, has used the song from Tetris as one of the regular chants for years,\u201d notes xtomx. \u201cWhy, you ask?

But reader David Hopkins reminded us of another.</p> <p>\u201cIn the 1930 World Cup semi-final between Argentina and the USA, the American team doctor Jack Coll ran on to treat an injured player, dropping his bag on to the pitch as he arrived to do so,\u201d he emails. \u201cThis caused a bottle of chloroform inside the bag to break, leading to Coll being overcome by fumes \u2026 and being carried off himself.\u201d</p> <h2>Wandering players: a follow-up</h2> <p><strong>Also last week, we had a section on players who have appeared for more than four clubs in a season,</strong> and while it doesn\u2019t trump the seven of Jefferson Lewis, Mark A Thomas has another nomination. \u201cRay Wilkins played for five in the 1996-97 season. He started as player-manager at QPR (one of the reasons he left I believe was because he was picking himself too much), played under his mate Alan Smith at Wycombe for one game, headed to Hibs for a few games, then came back down to Millwall and Leyton Orient.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Mitchel Ankers has a correction: \u201cWhilst reading this week\u2019s Knowledge, I spotted a minor inaccuracy regarding John Burridge\u2019s career history.</p> <p><em>\u2018It should be said that he didn\u2019t play all that much. Of the 19 clubs he\u2019d signed for, he only played a total 29 games for half of them. Interestingly, he was listed as player-manager of his final club Blyth Spartans without actually playing.\u2019</em></p> <p>\u201cI have a vivid recollection of attending a first round FA Cup tie between Blackpool and Blyth Spartans in 1997 where John Burridge featured in goal for Blyth. As a nine-year old Blackpool fan at the time I knew nothing about him but I remember there being a lot of fanfare surrounding the return of a club legend, so I was convinced my memory was right. I then found <a href=\"https://blythspirit.wordpress.com/2014/11/03/classic-matches-blackpool-fa-cup-19971998/ \">this blog article</a> which suggests that he did play in the match. I think the issue here is that Wikipedia only records league appearances so it\u2019s not a reliable source on whether or not a player played for a club in any competition at all.\u201d</p> <p>Wikipedia? Inaccurate? Surely not. </p> <h2>Knowledge archive</h2> <p><strong>\u201cWho is the shortest goalkeeper to have played for a major European club?\u201d </strong>mused Daniel Koytchev <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/23/the-knowledge-players-no-transfer-fees-ever\">three years ago</a>.</p> <p>Immediately we shall dispense with the \u201cmajor European club\u201d aspect of this question, Daniel, because there aren\u2019t that many wee keepers to go around. Only one gets close to satisfying your criteria, and that\u2019s Bert Williams, who played for Wolves during the finest period in their history, winning the FA Cup in 1949 and the league title in 1954. Later that year Williams, who stood 5ft 9in tall in his socks, played in goal when Wolves beat Honved 3-2 in one of the \u201dfloodlit friendlies\u201d that inspired the European Cup. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxoI4AjgokU\">In the Path\u00e9 News footage</a> you can see him making a double save at the end of the first half, leaving Wolves with just the two goals to make up in the second. Roy Swinbourne\u2019s second goal, Wolves\u2019 third, in the 78th minute, is a belter. Also in the late 1940s/early 50s, Wilf Chisholm stood between the sticks for Grimsby Town \u2013 all 5ft 8in of him.</p> <p>If we were playing Mallett\u2019s Mallet, chances are you\u2019d respond to \u201cshort goalkeepers\u201d with \u201cJorge Campos\u201d (or, if not, get biffed on the bonce). It\u2019s been suggested that Campos was as short as 5ft 6in, but most sources put him at 5ft 8in \u2013 either way, he didn\u2019t loom large in the penalty area, but he more than made up for any lack of height <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2011/jul/06/terrible-goalkeeping-kits-gallery#/?picture=376558630&amp;index=1\">with his fashion sense</a> (all goalkeepers should be asked to design their own shirts, please) and athleticism. Campos was always charging off his line, and even if he had committed himself going the wrong way, he often managed to wriggle back in to position to snaffle the ball away from the toes of attackers. Mexico have also had \u00d3scar P\u00e9rez in goal, measuring 5ft 7in and known as the Rabbit for his leporidine agility.</p> <p>Also 5ft 7in was the Reading goalkeeper Steve Death (is this the only time anyone can have been \u201csaved by Death\u201d?), the man who went 11 matches without conceding a goal to set a then-record English total of 1,103 minutes without picking the ball out of the back of the net. In the promotion-winning 1978-79 season, he kept 26 clean sheets, conceding in only a quarter of Reading\u2019s home matches. He wasn\u2019t much of a kicker, but he was quick off his line and a great shot-stopper. After his debut for Reading, a 1-0 win over Brighton, one report called him \u201can insignificantly built bundle of daredevil energy\u201d, a description we think rather lovely.</p> <ul> <li><em>For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge\">the Knowledge archive</a>.</em></li> </ul> <h2>Can you help?</h2> <p>\u201cAfter the recent death <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/13/thai-king-bhumibol-adulyadej-dies-after-70-year-reign\">of the King of Thailand</a> it was announced that the current standings in the Thai football leagues will stand with three rounds of games still remaining,\u201d reports Robert Davies. \u201cThis means that whoever was in the relegation zone at the time were relegated, whoever was leading the league was pronounced champion, etc. Has something like this ever happened before in any other leagues?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA couple of evenings ago some friends and I realised that the exciting new Watford player (and nominative determinist) Isaac Success has only two unique consonants in his first name and surname combined,\u201d cheers Jack Webb. \u201cA friend later realised that Dele Alli also has only two.

  "<p>In a little copse of oak, hazel and willow trees, on the edge of a ploughed field in Cambridgeshire, a door is opening into a new way of death for 21st-century Britain: a brand new stone-and-earth round barrow, a burial mound of a type perfected more than 5,000 years ago.<br></p> <p>Beyond the low, narrow door, the stone walls curving up to a corbelled roof are lined with hundreds of niches, waiting for the living to pay up to \u00a34,800 to lease a space for the cremated remains of loved ones to rest for 99 years \u2013 and, its creators hope, for centuries longer than that.</p> <p>Before the official launch of the <a href=\"http://www.sacredstones.co.uk/\">Sacred Stones</a><a> burial mound</a>, the first booking for a niche came from a man on his mobile phone, standing in a car park outside the hospital where his father was gravely ill. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c16e38e77668c8f85c159c9d1bef874d525899ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c16e38e77668c8f85c159c9d1bef874d525899ad/0_367_5504_3302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sacred Stones burial mound\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The space is lit with candles when visitors are expected</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The early visitors have included potential clients but also landowners curious about the investment potential, a vicar, a bank manager who had already agreed the loan but was fascinated by the project, and several local authority planners.</p> <p> Some who stepped into the cool darkness \u2013 there is no electricity, and the space is lit with candles when visitors are expected \u2013 away from the sound of birdsong and the traffic on the busy road a few fields away have burst into tears, some laughed out loud, and many just sat down on the stone bench and remained for some time in silence.</p> <p> It was the blue nylon carpet in an urban crematorium that convinced Toby Angel there had to be a better way of doing death.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a08d27036762cda2715ab03881eb200713f4ca89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a08d27036762cda2715ab03881eb200713f4ca89/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roof of Sacred Stones burial mound\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The corbelled roof of the burial mound</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe cremated my poor aunt, and it was the absolutely typical affair, blue carpet, Luther Vandross, 20 minutes later the next family is hanging around looking embarrassed waiting to get in, and everyone shuffles out to look at the flowers.

He spoke to one young mother with terminal cancer, who wanted cremation but didn\u2019t want her ashes scattered: her children, she felt, would need a place where they could come and rage with anger against her for abandoning them.</p> <p>The first new barrow they know of was built by Tim Daw, a farmer and amateur archaeologist, on his land in Wiltshire near Stonehenge, and is now two-thirds full. Fildes heard that Daw was going to build in concrete, and approached him to suggest a traditional structure instead, built in hand-dressed slabs of stone without cement, and sheltered by a mound of earth, like the West Kennet Long Barrow near his farm which was built more than 5,000 years ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dbf792a528641b21fea4b80060af005aff46056b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbf792a528641b21fea4b80060af005aff46056b/0_575_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"Toby Angel\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toby Angel outside the burial mound</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Daw\u2019s was a one-off, but Angel, Fildes, scientist Mark Davis and stonemason Geraint Davies have formed a new company, Sacred Stones, to develop the concept. Willow Row was built in just five months out of 300 tonnes of limestone from a quarry in Oundle, on a small patch of land leased for the next century on a farm near Saint Neots. They already have planning permission for a site in Herefordshire, and as word spreads have had inquiries from half a dozen counties, from Orkney, and even from Canada. They have been asked about woodland burials, ash scattering, and funeral pyres \u2013 the latter an interesting idea, Angel said, but not for them, or not yet.</p> <p>Sophie Churchill, a forestry expert and president of the Royal Forestry Society, is also project leader of the strikingly named <a href=\"http://www.thecorpseproject.net/\">Corpse Project</a>, a research project backed by the Wellcome Institute on contemporary attitudes to death, which has been looking at what happens to the bodies of the 500,000 people who die in England and Wales every year. Most are now cremated, with issues including the materials used in coffins, the toxic byproducts of embalming, and where to scatter gritty salty ashes without choking trees and plants to death.</p> <p>They offer brutally practical advice: anyone planning to lay out a body for a wake at home in the traditional way, in a centrally heated modern house, is advised to stock up on ice packs well in advance.</p> <p>\u201cIn England we have been very bad at confronting the reality of death until it actually occurs, and then we stumble into it an very awkward, embarrassed way. But there are signs that attitudes are changing, and I think Toby\u2019s project \u2013 certainly not an option for everyone \u2013 is part of that.\u201d<br></p> <p>The first great revolution was the widespread acceptance of cremation, she says. She sees another under way now in the natural death movement, death cafes, homemade funerals, cardboard and wicker coffins \u2013 once seen as appealing only to a hippy fringe, now available from high street undertakers \u2013 woodland burials, and a growing acceptance that with conventional cemeteries running out of space fast, there will have to be an alternative to an eternal resting place six feet under.</p> <p>Toby Angel thinks death should be taught in schools. \u201cIt\u2019s the one thing that is absolutely certainly going to happen to all of us, and yet we are given no help whatsoever to prepare for it.\u201d</p> <p>He hopes that the days when the urns are placed in the niches can be joyful occasions for the families.</p> <p>\u201cThere must be tea and biscuits. Bring a brass band. Bring a bottle. Bring a priest. Bring a shaman. Death is sad, but it doesn\u2019t have to be solemn.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Theresa May has been criticised for refusing to prioritise membership of the single market when Britain leaves the EU after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/exclusive-leaked-recording-shows-what-theresa-may-really-thinks-about-brexit\">the emergence of a leaked tape</a> from before the referendum in which she warned companies would leave if the UK pulls out.</p> <p>\u201cI think the economic arguments are clear,\u201d she said. \u201cI think being part of a 500 million trading bloc is significant for us,\u201d said May, adding that membership of the union also made the UK a safer place.</p> <p>Opposition politicians said her comments to Goldman Sachs bankers, made a month before the poll in June, showed May really believed the UK was better off in the single market, even though she has signalled controls on immigration are the most important thing to secure from a Brexit deal with the EU.</p> <p>EU leaders have repeatedly said the UK cannot stay in the single market if it wants to end freedom of movement for EU citizens.<br></p> <p>Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, tweeted: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Tweet\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Before referendum PM says access to 500m strong trading bloc essential; now won&amp;#39;t make economy &amp;amp; jobs the priority! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/EaqRLxd59F&quot;&gt;https://t.co/EaqRLxd59F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer/status/791051978545782784&quot;&gt;October 25, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><br></p> <p>His colleague, Andrew Gwynne, the shadow minister without portfolio, added: \u201cAs if we needed it, this recording is cast-iron evidence of how Theresa May and other senior Tories have been saying one thing in private about the economic impact of Brexit and another in the comfort of Tory conference halls.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s plain that she recognises what a disaster it would be for Britain to lose access to the single market, so why doesn\u2019t she be honest with the British people and say how she plans to retain it?\u201d</p> <p>Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, said it was \u201cdisappointing that Theresa May lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of Brexit\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cMore disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge, she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self-harm on the UK economy by pulling Britain out of the single market.\u201d</p> <p>Phil Wilson, an MP speaking for the Open Britain group campaigning for the UK to stay in the single market, added: \u201cIt\u2019s good to know that privately Theresa May thinks what many of us have been saying publicly for a long time \u2013 leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy.</p> <p>\u201cNow she is prime minister, Theresa May is in an unrivalled position to act on her previous concerns \u2013 starting by putting membership of the single market at the heart of her government\u2019s negotiating position.\u201d</p> <p>The news comes as a thinktank warns that the worsening economic outlook could leave the chancellor facing an \u00a384bn black hole when he lays out the government\u2019s spending plans next month. The Resolution Foundation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/26/hammond-80bn-black-hole-economic-worsens-brexit-treasury\">warned Philip Hammond</a> that lower tax receipts and higher spending following the Brexit vote would leave the Treasury with a shortfall every year until 2020-21.<br><br>Speaking on 26 May, the then home secretary appeared to go further than her public remarks to explain more clearly the economic benefits of staying in the EU. She told staff it was time the UK took a lead in Europe, and that she hoped voters would look to the future rather than the past.<br></p> <p>In an hour-long session before the City bankers, she also worried about the effect of Brexit on the British economy.</p> <p>She said: \u201cIf we were not in Europe, I think there would be firms and companies who would be looking to say: do they need to develop a mainland Europe presence rather than a UK presence? So I think there are definite benefits for us in economic terms.\u201d</p> <p>Her warning about the importance of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU comes in marked contrast to her <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/oct/20/theresa-may-to-tell-eus-other-leaders-there-will-be-no-second-referendum\">positioning in recent weeks</a>.</p> <p>May said at the Conservative party conference that she wanted to <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\">prioritise reducing immigration</a> over being part of the single market. In her speech, she said British companies needed the \u201cmaximum freedom to trade and operate in the single market\u201d but not at the expense of \u201cgiving up control of immigration again\u201d or accepting the jurisdiction of judges in Luxembourg.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/26/why-theresa-mays-secret-speech-really-does-matter\">Why Theresa May's secret speech really does matter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At Goldman Sachs, May also said she was convinced Britain\u2019s security was best served by remaining in Europe because of tools such as the European arrest warrant and information-sharing between the police and intelligence agencies.</p> <p>\u201cThere are definitely things we can do as members of the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/eu\">European Union</a> that I think keep us more safe,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The disclosures could prove embarrassing for the prime minister, who faced <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/sep/25/brexit-books-david-cameron-theresa-may-party-split\">criticism for lying low during the referendum campaign</a> and offering only lukewarm support for the remain side.</p> <p>In April, May gave a speech in which she set out some of the reasons for staying in the EU, <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2016/04/theresa-mays-speech-on-brexit-full-text.html\">warning that it could have an impact on the development of the single market for the rest of the EU</a> if the UK left. But her comments at the Goldman Sachs event a month later go further in warning about the dangers to the British economy from businesses relocating to continental Europe.</p> <p>During the referendum campaign, May infuriated senior Conservative colleagues on the remain side by largely staying out of the day-to-day arguments in favour of staying in the EU. One of her major pro-remain interventions was overshadowed by an announcement that she would like to take the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/apr/25/uk-must-leave-european-convention-on-human-rights-theresa-may-eu-referendum\">UK out of the European convention on human rights</a>, which she quickly ditched when running for the party leadership.</p> <p>Her refusal to participate much in the campaign led Craig Oliver, David Cameron\u2019s former chief of communications, to wonder if she was secretly an \u201cenemy agent\u201d for the other side. However, others have suggested she believed in the arguments for staying in but was keeping her powder dry in case of a pro-Brexit vote.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs confirmed May had spoken to staff but was not paid. She accepted an invitation as part of the bank\u2019s Talks@GS programme, in which high achievers from all walks of life are given a chance to reflect on their experiences and answer questions.</p> <p>Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP and former shadow business secretary, said May was \u201cright then \u2013 and it underlines why single market membership should be her ambition now\u201d.<br></p> <p>A No 10 spokesman said: \u201cBritain made a clear choice to vote to leave the EU and this government is determined to make a success of the fresh opportunities it presents.</p> <p>\u201cDavid Davis made very clear in the House of Commons last week the importance the government places on financial services across the UK in the negotiation to come, as has the chancellor in recent weeks.</p> <p>\u201cWe want a smooth and orderly exit from the European Union, which would be in the interests of both Britain and the EU.\u201d</p>",

But it has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/11/cassie-jaye-red-pill-feminism-mens-rights\">faced backlash</a> from members of the feminist community and has <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-capsule-red-pill-review-20161008-snap-story.html\">been criticised</a> as unbalanced and in favour of men\u2019s rights groups.</p> <p>The Australian premiere was cancelled on Wednesday, after an online petition calling on the cinema to abandon the \u201cmisogynistic propaganda film\u201d eclipsed 2,000 signatures.</p> <p>Susie Smith, who founded <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/palace-cinemas-stop-palace-cinemas-screening-the-red-pill-film\">the petition on change.org</a>, said the film gave a platform to views similar to those of Daryush \u201cRoosh V\u201d Valizadeh, a self-described neo-masculinist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/02/controversial-neo-masculinist-daryush-valizadeh-claims-he-can-enter-australia-with-no-visa\">whose planned visit to Australia</a> caused a stir with immigration in February.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the kind of disgusting, violent message that is totally out of line with Australian values and law,\u201d Smith wrote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/04/daryush-roosh-v-valizadeh-cancels-neo-masculinist-meetings-over-safety\">Daryush 'Roosh V' Valizadeh cancels neo-masculinist meetings over safety</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPlease do not associate your cinema with the kind of people who teach men how to violate women physically and emotionally.

Guardian Australia has contacted Williams for comment.</p> <p>Williams pasted the email above <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/stop-extremists-censoring-what-australians-are-allowed-to-see-save-the-red-pill-screening-0c5c742e-f44d-4ade-8b17-4c5c576cab2b\">a rival petition on change.org</a>, set up to \u201cstop extremists censoring what Australians are allowed to see\u201d. At time of writing it had more than 5,000 signatures. </p> <p>In the email, the representative of Kino cinema told Williams that much of the feedback to the screening of The Red Pill assumed that it was a \u201ccuratorial decision ... which is potentially damaging to our credibility as we are yet to see the film so cannot stand by its contents in the face of the criticism we are receiving\u201d.</p> <p><br></p> <p> </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Palace Cinemas confirmed that the email pasted by Williams was sent by staff at Kino cinema.</p> <p>Benjamin Zeccola, chief executive of Palace Cinemas, told Guardian Australia on Thursday that the decision to cancel the screening was made \u201cin the absence of any judgement of the film, filmmakers or attendees\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, what was initially booked as a closed, private screening was being publicised widely and this in turn upset a significant proportion of our customers, who communicated their feelings to us directly.</p> <p>\u201cUpon receiving such direct feedback we realised that irrespective of the content, its presence in one of our cinemas was offensive to a large section of our core audience and movie club members. Therefore we took the decision to cancel the screening aware that regardless of the decision we took, a significant number of people would be disgruntled: so we took the decision that we think was best for our customer base at that time.\u201d</p> <p>Jaye rallied against the decision on social media, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RedPillMovie/posts/1209351719122129\">and called for</a> \u201cone Melbourne movie theatre to defend free speech\u201d and host the screening.</p> <p>\u201cThe numbers are on our side, people want to see The Red Pill, so why aren\u2019t any Australian movie theatres wiling to stand up to censorship?\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>Williams told <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/mens-rights-group-vows-to-push-ahead-with-documentary-screening/news-story/6b13eab641877fe0ed2e527dd489448c\">the Herald Sun</a> he was \u201cdetermined\u201d to find a new venue to screen her film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Cassie_Jaye/status/790771137760243712\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It&#39;s confirmed: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/palace_cinemas\">@palace_cinemas</a> has pulled The Red Pill, a film they have not even seen!

  "<p>Can war be beautiful?

Their military genius is a moment of glorious payback in a history dominated by white exploitation, rapacity and racism since the Dutch settled at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652. Johannes Phokela cleverly pastiches 17th-century European art in his painting Pantomime Act Trilogy (1999): child soldiers wearing Comic Relief red noses and the rotting bodies of colonial forebears inhabit baroque architectures painted in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grisaille\">grisaille</a>. Phokela\u2019s surreal painting captures the strangeness and macabre violence of the history this exhibition resurrects. </p> <p>South Africa: Art of a Nation tells the longest story of art any nation can claim. The oldest exhibit here is 3m years old. It is a pebble with a face. The way it looks is accidental. Its two eye-like holes and slit of a mouth were cut by natural erosion. So what makes it art? An <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecine\">australopithecene</a> \u2013 an early hominin \u2013 picked it up and carried it home, apparently because of the way it looked.

But her comments at the Goldman Sachs event a month later go further in warning about the dangers to the British economy from businesses relocating to continental Europe. </p> <p>During the referendum campaign, May infuriated senior Conservative colleagues on the remain side by largely staying out of the day-to-day arguments in favour of staying in the EU.

However, others have suggested she believed in the arguments for staying in but was keeping her powder dry in case of a pro-Brexit vote.</p> <p>May went to Goldman Sachs as a guest speaker and answered questions from the floor. In relaxed exchanges, she praised Cameron, the then prime minister, and said he had returned with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/02/theresa-may-announces-intention-to-back-eu-membership\">important concessions</a> from his EU summit earlier in the year.</p> <p>She sidestepped a question about whether she wanted to be prime minister and focused on explaining why Britain should stay in the EU. May said: \u201cThat is one of my messages in terms of the issue of the referendum, actually we shouldn\u2019t be voting to try to recreate the past, we should be voting for what is right for the future.\u201d</p> <p>Goldman Sachs confirmed May had spoken to staff but was not paid. She accepted an invitation as part of the bank\u2019s Talks@GS programme, in which high achievers from all walks of like are given a chance to reflect on their experiences and answer questions. </p> <p>Previous speakers in the series include double Olympic champion Dame Kelly Holmes, David Benioff, the co-creator of the Game of Thrones TV series, and Loyd Grossman, the man behind the eponymous sauces.

Trump is so repulsive not because he offends our civilisation\u2019s most basic values, but because he embodies them.</p> <p>Trump personifies the traits promoted by the media and corporate worlds he affects to revile; the worlds that created him. He is the fetishisation of wealth, power and image in a nation where <a href=\"http://valuesandframes.org/\">extrinsic values</a> are championed throughout public discourse.

None of this distinguishes him from the majority of the very rich, whose entrepreneurial image, loyally projected by the media, clashes with their histories of huge bequests, government assistance, monopolies and rent-seeking.</p> <p>If his politics differ from those of the rest of the modern Republican party, it is because he is, in some respects, more liberal.

Encouraged by the corporate media, the Republicans have been waging a full-spectrum assault on empathy, altruism and the decencies we owe to other people. Their gleeful stoving in of faces, their cackling destruction of political safeguards and democratic norms, their stomping on all that is generous and caring and cooperative in human nature, have turned the party into a game of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/23/mortal-kombat-x-review-violent-but-charmingly-hammy\">Mortal Kombat</a> scripted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/19/reading-breitbart-news-steve-bannon-donald-trump\">Breitbart News</a>.</p> <p>Did Trump invent the xenophobia and racism that infuse his campaign?

In the <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp\">10th federalist paper</a>, written in 1787, he argued that large republics were better insulated from corruption than small, or \u201cpure\u201d democracies, as the greater number of citizens would make it \u201cmore difficult for unworthy candidates to practise with success the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried\u201d. A large electorate would protect the system against oppressive interest groups. Politics practised on a grand scale would be more likely to select people of \u201cenlightened views and virtuous sentiments\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, the US \u2013 in common with many other nations \u2013 now suffers the worst of both worlds: a large electorate dominated by a tiny faction. Instead of republics being governed, as Madison feared, by \u201cthe secret wishes of an unjust and interested majority\u201d, they are beholden to the not-so-secret wishes of an unjust and interested minority. What Madison could not have foreseen was the extent to which unconstrained campaign finance and a sophisticated lobbying industry would come to dominate an entire nation, regardless of its size.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/25/elizabeth-warren-us-president-workers-rights-wall-street\">Elizabeth Warren is the US president we need, but can\u2019t have \u2013 this time | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For every representative, Republican or Democrat, who retains a trace element of independence, there are three sitting in the breast pocket of corporate capital. Since the supreme court decided that there should be no effective limits on campaign finance, and, to a lesser extent, long before, candidates have been reduced to tongue-tied automata, incapable of responding to those in need of help, incapable of regulating those in need of restraint, for fear of upsetting their funders.</p> <p>Democracy in the US is so corrupted by money that it is no longer recognisable as democracy. You can kick individual politicians out of office, but what do you do when the entire structure of politics is corrupt? Turn to the demagogue who rages into this political vacuum, denouncing the forces he exemplifies. The problem is not, as Trump claims, that the election will be stolen by ballot rigging. It is that the entire electoral process is stolen from the American people before they get anywhere near casting their votes. When Trump claims that the little guy is being screwed by the system, he\u2019s right. The only problem is that he is the system.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/583qb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2817569\"            data-video-name=\"Eleven women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian, Access Hollywood, AP, CNN, Getty Images, NBC, Reuters, Palm Beach Post\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58066cf1e4b0cd26ff71e6cc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/24/161024women_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/24/161024women.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/24/161024women_KP-2166838.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\">Eleven women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The political constitution of the United States is not, as Madison envisaged, representation tempered by competition between factions. The true constitution is plutocracy tempered by scandal. In other words, all that impedes the absolute power of money is the occasional exposure of the excesses of the wealthy. What distinguishes Trump\u2019s political career is that, until recently, his scandals have done him no harm.</p> <p>Trump disgusts us because, where others use a dog whistle, he uses a klaxon. We hate to hear his themes so clearly articulated. But we know in our hearts that they suffuse the way the world is run.</p> <p>Because this story did not begin with Trump, it will not end with Trump, however badly he may lose the election. Yes, he is a shallow, mendacious, boorish and extremely dangerous man. But those traits ensure that he is not an outsider but the perfect representation of his caste, the caste that runs the global economy and governs our politics. He is our system, stripped of its pretences.</p>",

Less than half the public (43%) say they have a great deal of confidence that their vote will be counted accurately, while 38% have some confidence and 17% have hardly any confidence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/25/american-political-parties-democrats-republicans-representation-survey\">Most Americans do not feel represented by Democrats or Republicans \u2013 survey</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580feb1de4b08d944ba4aa23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T23:30:51.560Z\">12.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>LeBron James - and Nike - appear to be coming for a certain presidential candidate\u2019s views regarding immigrants, women and inner-city African Americans in a new ad:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOZxIpy6Gm4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dOZxIpy6Gm4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580fe799e4b08d944ba4aa11\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T23:15:52.392Z\">12.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>TrumpTV is back after Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Florida:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Donald Trump, TV\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FDonaldTrump%2Fvideos%2F10157973074675725%2F&show_text=0&width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580fe139e4b08d944ba4a9ed\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/spencerackerman\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T22:50:02.348Z\">11.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Analysis: Hillary Clinton's plans for no-fly zones in Syria could provoke US-Russia conflict</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Retired senior <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military\">US military</a> pilots<strong> </strong>are increasingly alarmed that Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposal for \u201cno-fly zones\u201d in Syria could lead to a military confrontation with Russia that could escalate to levels that were previously unthinkable in the post-cold war world.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5808ba39e54a90bc64f62b75397b3424d2d45f81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5808ba39e54a90bc64f62b75397b3424d2d45f81/0_0_2400_1526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maria Lorenzino/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The former strategists spoke to the Guardian as Clinton\u2019s Republican rival Donald Trump warned that Clinton\u2019s proposal to establish \u201csafe zones\u201d to protect beleaguered Syrian civilians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/25/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-syria-world-war-three\">would \u201clead to world war three\u201d</a>.<br></p> <p>The proposal of no-fly zones has been fiercely debated in Washington for the past five years, but has never attracted significant enthusiasm from the military because of the risk to pilots from Syrian air defenses and the presence of Russian warplanes.</p> <p>Many in US national security circles consider the risk of an aerial confrontation with the Russians to be severe.<br></p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft,\u201d said James Clapper, the US director of national intelligence, on Tuesday in response to a question from the Guardian at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p> <p>Those who have patrolled no-fly zones over the relatively freer skies of Bosnia and Saddam-era Iraq fear that a President Clinton would oblige the US to what one retired US air force three-star general described as an indefinite \u201cair occupation\u201d.

The Times is using them as the basis for this article and a two-part episode of its election podcast, \u201cThe Run-Up.\u201d<br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Here\u2019s a pretty amazing anecdote:</strong></p> <p>\u201cAnd when Mr. Trump feels he has been made a fool of, his response can be volcanic. Ivana Trump told Mr. D\u2019Antonio about a Colorado ski vacation she took with Mr. Trump soon after they began dating. The future Mrs. Trump had not told her boyfriend that she was an accomplished skier. As she recalls it, Mr. Trump went down the hill first and waited for her at the bottom:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>IVANA TRUMP: So he goes and stops, and he says, \u201cCome on, baby. Come on, baby.\u201d I went up. I went two flips up in the air, two flips in front of him. I disappeared. Donald was so angry, he took off his skis, his ski boots, and walked up to the restaurant. ... <strong>He could not take it. He could not take it.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c9c7d2f727ed4e47301fbf193a15304e47e65d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c9c7d2f727ed4e47301fbf193a15304e47e65d5/0_306_4985_2993/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cI went two flips up in the air.\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cI went two flips up in the air.\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Sacha/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T15:20:25.696Z\">at 4.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580f75dae4b0219a00d3870f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T15:10:34.407Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hillary Clinton turns 69 tomorrow. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dougmillsnyt/status/790929216619548676\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton\">@HillaryClinton</a> gives a thumbs up when asked about how Stevie Wonder performed last night at her fundraiser/early birthday party. <a href=\"https://t.co/vxKHN3aZn7\">pic.twitter.com/vxKHN3aZn7</a></p>&mdash; Doug Mills (@dougmillsnyt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dougmillsnyt/status/790929216619548676\">October 25, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580f72d5e4b01c528432c716\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T15:02:36.992Z\">4.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Reader challenge: what's your map look like?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is a two-part challenge, actually.

Wasserman imagines a Clinton landslide, a Clinton majority, a 2012 redux, a Clinton squeaker \u2013 and, yes, a Trump upset.</p> <p>The piece rather brilliantly imagines the turnout and loyalties of various demographic groups underlying each imagined result, as well as likely down-ballot effects. </p> <p><strong>In the landslide scenario,</strong> Wasserman imagines Clinton with 413 electoral votes, including victories in Arizona, Texas and Georgia; he gives Utah to independent candidate Evan McMullin. In this scenario, senate candidate Patrick Murphy upsets Marco Rubio in Florida and the Democrats end up with a 54-seat senate majority. But, to underscore just how hard this would be, <em><strong>the Democrats still don\u2019t take the House</strong></em>.</p> <p><strong>What about the Trump upset?</strong> He gets Pennsylvania (where polling averages have Clinton up six points), Wisconsin (ditto) and New Hampshire (five points), in addition to all the Romney states plus Florida, Iowa and Ohio.

  "<p>Persuading \u201cparanoid\u201d North Korea to stop building nuclear weapons is probably a lost cause and efforts to cap its capability are the best hope, according to the US director of national intelligence.</p> <p>James Clapper\u2019s comments on Tuesday come amid mounting concern that the North is moving closer toward having a nuclear-tipped missile that could reach the American mainland. It has conducted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/09/north-korea-nuclear-test-earthquake\">two atomic test explosions in 2016</a> and more than 20 ballistic missile tests.</p> <p>The US has long insisted that it will not accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state and the state department said on Tuesday there had been no change in policy.</p> <p>Clapper said that while North Korea has yet to test its KN-08 intercontinental ballistic missile, the US already operated on the assumption that Pyongyang potentially had the capability to launch a missile that could reach parts of the United States, particularly Alaska and Hawaii.</p> <p>\u201cI think the notion of getting the North Koreans to denuclearise is probably a lost cause,\u201d Clapper said at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. He added that the best the US could probably get is some kind of a cap on North Korea\u2019s nuclear capabilities.</p> <p>\u201cThey are under siege and they are very paranoid, so the notion of giving up their nuclear capability, whatever it is, is a nonstarter with them,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>US administrations have demanded that North Korea agree to denuclearisation, although aid-for-disarmament negotiations have been stalled for years and sanctions have failed to stop the North\u2019s weapons\u2019 programmes.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/north-korea-nuclear-weapons-development-timeline\">Timeline: North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons development</a> </p> </aside>  <p>State department spokesman John Kirby said he had not seen Clapper\u2019s comments but said the US still aimed for a resumption of six-nation aid-for-disarmament negotiations that have been stalled since the North pulled out of the talks in 2009 \u2014 three years after conducting its first nuclear test.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe want to continue to see a verifiable denuclearisation of the peninsula. We want to see a return to the six-party talk process and that means we need to see the North show a willingness and an ability to return to that process which they haven\u2019t done yet,\u201d Kirby said.</p> <p>Separately on Tuesday, Scott Busby, a senior state department official for human rights, criticized China\u2019s implementation of UN sanctions against North Korea that are intended to starve it of revenue for its development of weapons of mass destruction.<br></p> <p>Busby, who was speaking at a Washington thinktank, said China\u2019s use of a loophole in the sanctions to purchase huge amounts of North Korean coal was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. He said coal sales were probably the North\u2019s main source of foreign currency.</p> <p>He said the No 2 US diplomat, Antony Blinken, would raise that issue at a planned meeting this week with Chinese officials in Beijing.</p> <p>The US wants China to agree to tighter UN sanctions on North Korea in response to a 9 September nuclear test explosion, and to enforce restrictions already in place.</p> <p>Busby credited China with a \u201cslight improvement\u201d in its treatment of North Korean asylum-seekers who escape across the northern border into China. But he added that China was still repatriating significant numbers to the North.</p> <p>The Obama administration says it is intent on tightening sanctions on the regime of Kim Jong-un, who has doubled down on increasing the North\u2019s nuclear arsenal. In addition to its nuclear and missile tests this year North Korea is also believed to producing more fissile material for bombs. US experts estimate North Korea has 13 to 21 nuclear weapons and could have as many as 100 by 2020.</p> <p><em>With Associated Press</em><br></p>",
