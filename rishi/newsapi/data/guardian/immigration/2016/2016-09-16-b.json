How are they going to survive?</p> <p>Fuelled by posts on social media, particularly Facebook, they have discovered what they think the root of their problems is \u2013 foreign investment and asset sales.

They don\u2019t just read Hanson\u2019s Facebook page, they are talking to her. She is talking to them. Hanson responds to multiple comments every day, reassuring people who are upset about particular policies and situations, arguing with people who disagree with her and seemingly taking them into her confidence (\u201cI don\u2019t handle compliments very well\u201d) while her fans tell her they are concerned about immigration, politician wages (\u201ccut them across the board to the average Australian\u2019s wages\u201d) or offering Hanson advice (\u201cI notice you get quite flustered when you are upset or angry, try mindfulness breathing\u201d). </p> <p>Or they just talk to her as they would any of their other mates on Facebook. \u201cGood job getting the tea in without looking, really good technique.\u201d</p> <p> Young has befriended people as part of the community and has had Hanson respond personally to her messages and comments.

Watch as those rivals swoop in, Bake Off style, to lure away the BBC\u2019s biggest names.</p> <p>The corporation has largely survived the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/12/guardian-view-on-bbc-charter-renewal\" title=\"\">charter review</a> process intact. But what a way to treat one of Britain\u2019s very few world-class cultural assets. (Full disclosure: I present <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006s7d6\" title=\"\">The Long View</a>, an occasional series on BBC Radio 4.) Instead of being nurtured, it is constantly hounded, buffeted from one&#xa0;renegotiation or review to the next, made constantly to fear for its future. The BBC\u2019s critics stand over it, criticising its every move, undermining its self-confidence and micro-managing its every decision.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What accounts for this war on a UK success story? In part it's commercial interest. But the key motive's ideological</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What accounts for this bizarre, decades-old war on an institution that is, in fact, a British success story? Part of it is crude commercial interest. For Rupert Murdoch and others, the BBC is a direct competitor to be fought. But the key motive is ideological. The notion of a hugely successful, publicly funded broadcaster offends the doctrine of free-market supremacism. James Murdoch once declared that the only reliable guarantor of editorial quality is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/24/james-murdoch-wrong-on-bbc\" title=\"\">profit</a>\u201d. Yet the BBC stands as&#xa0;a rebuttal. It does not work for profit and yet it works. Brilliantly.</p> <p>You would think conservatives, of all people, would want to protect such an institution. You\u2019d think they would see the BBC as a venerable, rooted British institution that ain\u2019t broke and does not need fixing. Yet that traditional, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/burke_edmund.shtml\" title=\"\">Burkean </a>conservatism is trumped by doctrinaire dogmatism: the BBC must be challenged at every turn because even though it works in practice, it does not work in theory. And it\u2019s theory that counts.</p> <p>This jars with our conventional understanding of the role of the right in our national life. Received wisdom holds that the left is ideological, driven by theory, while the right is practical, empirical and unimpressed by -isms. Indeed, in this view, -isms and -ologies are properly the province of those funny continentals: in Britain, and especially England, it\u2019s what works that counts.</p> <p>The rhetoric may still nod in that direction. May, like David Cameron before her, projects a suitably sceptical disdain for grandiose ideology. But look at the deeds rather than the words. May is promising the return of grammar schools not because there is any evidence that they improve social mobility \u2013 on the contrary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-grammar-school-selection-middle-class\" title=\"\">they do not</a> \u2013 but because of a Conservative commitment to the principle of selection. The ideal matters more than the reality.</p> <p>And of course the big example is Brexit. The leaders of the EU are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/bratislava-summit-donald-tusk-urges-eu-leaders-not-to-waste-brexit-crisis\" title=\"\">meeting this weekend</a> in Bratislava. But there will only be 27 of them. Britain has absented itself, even before it has formally started divorce proceedings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/ukip-elects-diane-james-as-new-party-leader\">Ukip elects Diane James as new party leader</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Among our European neighbours, the most common reaction to the 23 June decision, even now, is disbelief. Britain had a set-up the other nations envied. We were signed up to the bits that worked for us \u2013 like the single market \u2013 but comfortably out of the things that did not, such as the euro or the Schengen no-border area. Speak to&#xa0;those involved and they\u2019re adamant: it will be impossible to negotiate anything like as good an arrangement for Britain once we\u2019re out.</p> <p>But, for the Brexiteering right, all that we had was worth ditching, just for the abstract, illusory notion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/26/brexit-campaign-wrong-uk-sovereign-nation-eu-masters-of-our-destiny-power\" title=\"\">unfettered sovereignty</a> (along with old-style hard-covered, blue passports, if Nigel Farage\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/ukip-elects-diane-james-as-new-party-leader\" title=\"\">parting speech</a> is any guide).

Yet in the eyes of those who led the charge for Brexit it was principle, not practical reality, that mattered most.</p> <p>Perhaps the key shift came with Margaret Thatcher, a radical who managed to dress up a ferociously ideological programme as if it were no more than household common sense. But the pattern is undisguised now. From the BBC to schooling to Brexit, we&#xa0;are ruled by those ready to wreck what works, for the sake of dogma. They&#xa0;call themselves conservative, but&#xa0;they betray the name.</p>",

  "<p>All political parties contain contradictions, but few are as confused about their purpose as Ukip. The party was founded in opposition&#xa0;to European integration and evolved into a less coherent nationalistic protest movement. On that journey, hostility towards \u201cBrussels\u201d has served as a sanitising agent, lending mainstream propriety to an organisation in which anxiety about a loss of identity sometimes merges with outright racism. The adhesive quality of Euroscepticism is weaker now that Britain has a prime minister committed to Brexit.

In presentational terms she was the slickest candidate; she appealed to members who want a more professional organisation. Nigel Farage shared but never achieved that objective, partly because of his narcissistic character and partly because of the nature of the movement he had built. Beyond the European question, there is a tension in Ukip between an ambition to be respectable and a wilful embrace of maverick identity that rejects \u201cestablishment\u201d notions of respectability. This problem was encapsulated in Mr Farage\u2019s problematic relationship with parliament, denouncing it as a den of corruption while desperately trying to win a seat there. The Faragist platform resonated widely enough to give Ukip <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/09/margate-ukip-greens-electoral-reform-farage\" title=\"\">a double-digit share</a> of the national vote without ever electing him an MP.</p> <p>That is a technical obstacle of the Westminster voting system, but it expresses also Mr Farage\u2019s failure to reassure mainstream voters that his claims to abhor racism were sincere. Ukip\u2019s only MP, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/10/ukip-wins-clacton-first-parliamentary-seat-douglas-carswell\" title=\"\">Douglas Carswell</a>, first won his seat when badged as a Tory, and he espouses an internationalist libertarianism that can share a tent with Ukip\u2019s anti-immigration, nativist tendency only if both sides agree to pretend they are compatible. That pretence is breaking down. Mr Carswell would look more at home rejoining the Conservatives. He is not alone. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/nigel-farage-aide-says-ukip-supporters-have-flocked-to-tories\" title=\"\">Alexandra Phillips</a>, Ukip\u2019s former head of media, told the Guardian today that she has joined the Tories and claimed that tens of thousands of Ukip members had done the same. Mrs May\u2019s commitment to Brexit, grammar schools and immigration control appear to have made her party once again a&#xa0;natural home for those who defected to Ukip in horror at David Cameron\u2019s dalliances with more liberal conservatism.</p> <p>Even before the Brexit vote, Mr Farage said that his party had reached the limits of growth available by recruiting disgruntled Tories. He envisaged future advances being made in Labour seats in the Midlands, the north of England and Wales. Many Labour MPs, witnessing the receptivity of their core voters to anti-EU messages during the referendum campaign, fear a challenge from Ukip could trigger a collapse of their heartland support. Ms James inherits an organisational shambles where the leading figures hate one another. Her first move was to stop the party\u2019s leader in Wales, the ex-Tory MP Neil Hamilton, from addressing conference. She has the notional support of Mr Farage, but only after his first-choice candidate, immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/31/ukip-leadership-favourite-steven-woolfe-legal-action-excluded\" title=\"\">excluded from the ballot</a> on technical grounds that supporters believe were trumped up and motivated by factional spite. The outgoing leader may not relinquish the limelight to which he has become so obviously addicted.</p> <p>Anyone who judges Ukip\u2019s influence in British politics to have been pernicious \u2013 laundering xenophobia with the ideological detergent of Euroscepticism \u2013 may enjoy seeing it consumed by factional bickering. But institutional malaise must not be confused with abeyance of the force Ukip represented. Brexit cannot satisfy many of those who voted to leave the EU because EU membership was not the root of their dissatisfaction. The drivers of Faragism \u2013 economic insecurity and disorientation connected to the pace of globalisation \u2013 will remain. The capacity of Mrs May\u2019s government to address them while bogged down in complex European negotiations, will be limited. A period of Ukip disarray still creates an opportunity for the Tories and Labour to reconnect with disillusioned supporters who have been lending protest votes to Ukip. That will not be easy, but the moment must be seized quickly. It may not last long.</p>",

On the contrary: under a president Trump, what happened in Flint could happen everywhere. It would be the inevitable outcome of what is quite possibly the only Trump policy we can be sure of: radical deregulation.</p> <p>Look at what happened in Flint in the 1980s: when nearly all of General Motors\u2019 plants in the city were either deemed to be noncompliant or flagged for potential noncompliance with EPA regulations, GM started closing its plants rather than face increasing labor and cleanup costs, according to <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/26/11117022/flint-michigan-water-crisis-lead-pollution-history\">an investigation</a> into the source of the Flint water contamination by the Verge. (Industry is not to blame for the whole water-poisoning debacle, but neither is it innocent.)<br></p> <p>Local officials were more worried about saving money than protecting the safety of Flint residents. But they didn\u2019t poison the water to begin with \u2013 a whole structural array of forces did, including Trump\u2019s beloved private sector dumping untreated waste.</p> <p>That\u2019s because the best check on the kind of gross state and local government mismanagement that we saw in Michigan is the EPA. The problem in Flint was not what the EPA did; it\u2019s what it didn\u2019t do. It\u2019s that the EPA was by an order of magnitude far too weak and inactive.<br></p> <p>As Joel Beauvais, head of the agency\u2019s water office put it in <a href=\"http://www.clickondetroit.com/live/watch-live-house-oversight-committee-holds-hearing-on-flint-water-crisis\">his testimony</a> before the House Oversight Committee earlier this year, the EPA urged local authorities to address the lack of corrosion control in Flint\u2019s water, \u201cBut (the EPA) encountered resistance.\u201d</p> <p>If Trump had his way, the agency would be <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-says-hed-eliminate-department-of-environment-protection/article/2584908\">gutted</a> entirely.

After leaving Flint, he turned around the very next day to condemn the EPA\u2019s Clean Water Rule in a speech in New York Thursday, and earlier this year, Trump lackey Chris Christie discussed Trump\u2019s desire to fire federal workers at the EPA and other regulatory agencies, <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/trump-hopes-to-purge-civil-service-of-democrats.html\">replacing them with CEOs</a>.</p> <p>As New York magazine <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/trump-hopes-to-purge-civil-service-of-democrats.html\">noted at the time</a>, \u201cIn Trump\u2019s America, progressives won\u2019t have to worry about former banking executives regulating their old colleagues \u2014 active CEOs will be doing that for their current ones.\u201d (You might replace \u201cprogressives\u201d with any old human worried about being poisoned.)</p> <p>Perhaps Christie\u2019s own abysmal record on clean water is worth mentioning as well. He recently vetoed a bill aimed at protecting children from lead poisoning in a cost-cutting measure that protects his budget, uncannily similar to the cardinal sin of local officials in Flint. Under Christie\u2019s administration, environmental inspections and enforcements have been slashed by at least 60%, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2016/02/flint_can_happen_in_nj_with_christie_siding_with_water_polluters_opinion.html\">according to</a> the New Jersey Star-Ledger. </p> <p>But let\u2019s keep the focus on Trump. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/14/john-doe-files-scott-walker-wisconsin\">the John Doe papers</a> leaked in the Guardian this week, Trump donated to the third-party group of a special prosecutor accused of coordinating with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker\u2019s recall campaign along with, guess who? The head of a lead paint company facing millions in lawsuits from poisoned residents.</p> <p>Walker would later sign off on legislation granting effective immunity to the lead paint industry (the law was later <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/election-matters/report-scott-walker-wisconsin-club-for-growth-received-support-from/article_b805be8e-b7f7-5b07-a7a6-682e1f4847f8.html\">blocked</a> by a federal court). And though Trump was not directly involved with that issue, he was broadly on their side of the political battle, donating $15,000 to the group at the center of the investigation. As in Flint, the population most affected was poor children.</p> <p>Defunding federal regulatory agencies like the EPA is simply easier to do as the country\u2019s chief executive than anything else Trump is proposing \u2013 Congress is <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/245137-house-panel-approves-3017b-bill-to-cut-epa-funds-block-climate\">already halfway there</a>.

The Smithsonian is saying that the African American experience is the American experience \u2013 which is true. But to have the black experience in need of such validation, to require a building of such grandeur with a tony address, is quite at odds with the current political moment. Although the museum is a celebration of blackness, it is also a project of US nationalism, meant to sell the image that African Americans have a claim to the American project when, in terms of life and wealth, we have no such claim.

The official narrative is that a black president, on his way out the door, can open this museum that will usher in a better future for African Americans. The less convenient truth is that US nationalism has continued to fail black America \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/colin-kaepernick-anthem-protest\">which is why football players are refusing to sing the national anthem</a>.

If you view it as I did \u2013 from the bottom to the top \u2013 you\u2019ll see them in this order. First, you dig into history by taking an elevator down, which <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/thrasherxy/status/776081286301638656\">ticks dates down</a> slowly from 2015, past 1776, until you get to the beginning of the 15th century \u2013 when you are deposited into a scene depicting the Atlantic world of the slave trade, in a time before there is even a real concept of Africa as a place. </p> <p>\u201cSlavery is foundational to the modern world,\u201d curator Nancy Berklew says in the exhibit, stressing it is a shared history that \u201ceveryone can learn from\u201d, white or black. Everyone in the US is a descendant of a national economy where sugar, cotton, banking, insurance and shipping \u2013 indeed, the entire US culture \u2013 were built by the labor of enslaved people.

On the other are more descriptions of slavery intended, as curator Michelle Wilkinson explained, to \u201calways show you there was a real person\u201d who was enslaved. One of the most effective exhibits here is a baby\u2019s cradle, carved out of wood, which has shackles over it. The cradle shows the cruelty of slavery, but also that enslaved people would carve, build, sing, draw, do whatever they could to show affection towards and share humanity with one other. I saw a black woman break down when she saw it and have to walk away. </p> <p>The history section moves forward through the present, including black queer people (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/23/us/flo-kennedy-feminist-civil-rights-advocate-and-flamboyant-gadfly-is-dead-at-84.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">Florynce Kennedy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/steventhrasher/walter-naegle-partner-of-the-late-bayard-rustin-talks-about\">Bayard Rustin</a> get shout outs) and a very good examination of the black feminist and black power movements of the 1960s.

There\u2019s a wonderful room dedicated to educator and philanthropist <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/mary-mcleod-bethune-9211266\">Mary McLeod Bethune</a>, a member of Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http://www.inmotionaame.org/gallery/detail.cfm;jsessionid=f8302929971473999832890?migration=9&amp;topic=8&amp;id=487435&amp;bhcp=1\">black cabinet</a>\u201d and national leader in women\u2019s clubs whose name ought to be as known as Oprah Winfrey\u2019s (whose name is on the museum\u2019s auditorium). </p> <p>There is also a fascinating and huge section dedicated to sports.

What happens when black people endorse it?

On the one hand, I could picture black families coming here and reveling, rightfully, in our contribution to the United States. The museum will help black adults and children feel celebrated in a society that disregards us, and such respite is necessary. It was truly joyous being with adult black journalists from around the country as giddy as kids going to Disneyland. </p> <p>And yet, the museum supports a fiction. What good to African Americans, I have to wonder, is a museum dedicated to us, when we are getting shot in the street daily? When we\u2019re routinely being slaughtered by police? When we die on average<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/28/not-white-thing-suicide-african-americans\"> years younger than our white counterparts</a>? When we have <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/02/why-some-americans-are-more-equal-than-others.html\">1/12th the wealth </a>of white people, and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/02/05/465748249/african-americans-face-uncertain-reality-despite-low-unemployment-rate\">twice as much unemployment</a>? </p> <p>I worry that the museum is playing into a central trap of respectability politics: that if we just present ourselves in right way \u2013 on the National Mall! with a modernist building! \u2013 black lives will be seen as worthy. This would be a tenuous fiction at the best of times, but especially while a black man has had the most high-profile seat at the table of respectability politics of them all: the American presidency, which has done little for altering disparities in black health or wealth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85a8b4e084dfb58a25ad9ed9f43f75855297d7cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85a8b4e084dfb58a25ad9ed9f43f75855297d7cc/0_108_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The taking the stage section of the exhibition.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The taking the stage section of the exhibition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This museum might have meant more, say, during the Reagan 80s of my youth, <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=40708\">when Martin Luther King Day</a> was inaugurated. Then, the fiction that a veneer of respectability could help black people would held more weight; my father, who hated Reagan, would have loved this museum and seen it as a chess move to get white people to take black people seriously. But when Obama formally opens the museum next week, he will do so as the first black president who is also leaving office with black people still suffering disproportionately. Black people have been protesting in the streets, football players have been kneeling and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/08/beyonce-black-panthers-homage-black-lives-matter-super-bowl-50\">even Beyonc\u00e9 has been wearing Panthers garb</a>, because we have seen that symbols of progress mean little in protecting us.</p> <p>That jig is up. If the Oval Office can\u2019t help our cause, can a museum? </p> <p>Or is this too big a goal to lay at the feet of the NMAAHC? <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.si.edu/About/People\">David Skorton</a>, the Smithsonian\u2019s secretary, said \u201cpeople appear to change, especially young people\u201d when they\u2019re in a museum. But the older I get, the less interested I am in racism as representation, or in terms of how people appear to change; I increasingly understand racism in terms of power relations. </p> <p>I was happy to see a great racial mix of creative people working at the museum as architects and curators. But as I walked around, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that as they scurried to get the museum ready for opening day, all the construction workers I saw were men, and most (not all) were white. At the same time, every single security worker I saw (male and female) was black, just like at most places. And in the cafeteria, every person serving food was black and brown, while the chefs and managers overseeing them were all white \u2013 something that felt especially uncomfortable as the food stations, like the slavery exhibits, were divided into southern and northern regions. When white tourists go to the cafeteria, they will be as likely to be served food by a black face as they would have a half-century ago. </p> <p>Is it asking too much to want a museum about African Americans to undo racial job patterns and upend power relations? Perhaps. But a museum like this is also bolstering a national American identity, so it has high ambitions which deserve to be scrutinized. It opens its doors when the Black Lives Matter movement has made football players, protesters and commentators like myself question everything about celebrating US nationalism.

  "<p>Our bay tree is one of the best buys we\u2019ve ever made. Bays grow happily in a pot or in the ground and, once they take to their new home, have to be regularly pruned to keep them under control, which has obvious benefits for the cook of the house. Even so, bay has a very underrated scent. Sure, it\u2019s the solid stalwart of the stock pot, but beyond that it tends to get overlooked. Not in our house, though, because bay is delicious in all kinds of dishes, from poached pears (or plums or damsons, as in today\u2019s second recipe) to simple creams and savoury rubs. I also regularly blitz a handful of bay leaves with other herbs and salt, and smear the result over a joint of meat or fish, or tuck it into the cavities.</p> <p>Our plum tree is another source of regular pleasure and every year around this time, we are awash with its fruit. Being at the front of the house, our tree also provides passers-by with free treats.</p> <h2><strong>Balsamic-baked new potatoes with taleggio cheese and bay</strong></h2> <p>This is a brilliantly satisfying dinner in its own right, but if you need something more, serve alongside roast pork or a Barnsley chop. Serves four as a main course, more as a side.</p> <p><strong>1 large white onion, peeled and halved </strong><br><strong>1kg new potatoes</strong><br><strong>Flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br><strong>4 tbsp balsamic vinegar</strong><br><strong>5 bay leaves (fresh, ideally)</strong><br><strong>150g taleggio, sliced</strong><br><strong>100g rocket leaves</strong><br><strong>A few sprigs fresh thyme, picked</strong><br><strong>20g finely shaved parmesan</strong><br><strong>1 lemon, juiced</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p> <p>Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Cut the onion into thick pieces across the halves; leave the potatoes whole or, if they are on the large side, cut them into bite-sized pieces. Toss the potatoes and onion in half a teaspoon of flaky sea salt (less if using fine sea salt), lay them in an oven tray and roast for 30-40 minutes, until golden and tender.</p> <p>Tip the cooked veg into an oven dish and pour the vinegar over the top. Toss to coat, then tuck in the bay leaves and cover with the slices of taleggio. Season with a touch more salt and lots of pepper, and bake for 10 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and golden.</p> <p>Meanwhile, put the rocket, thyme leaves and parmesan in a bowl, dress with the lemon juice and oil, season generously and toss gently. Serve with the hot, cheesy potatoes.</p> <h2><strong>Damson (or plum) trifle</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82200da577e6334ee0b5062737294440486c70a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82200da577e6334ee0b5062737294440486c70a6/0_51_1881_1128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers\u2019 damson (or plum) trifle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers\u2019 damson (or plum) trifle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian.

Serves four.</p> <p><strong>20 ripe damsons or 10 plums</strong><br><strong>20g dark brown sugar </strong><br><strong>1 cinnamon stick </strong><br><strong>3 cloves </strong><br><strong>2 star anise </strong><br><strong>1 lemon, zest peeled off in long strips (use a vegetable peeler)</strong><br><strong>100ml damson (or plum) vodka (or brandy if you have neither)</strong></p> <p>For the sponge <br><strong>100g caster sugar </strong><br><strong>4 large free-range eggs </strong><br><strong>100g self-raising flour</strong></p> <p>For the custard <br><strong>300ml double cream</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp damson vodka (optional)</strong><br><strong>1 vanilla pod</strong><br><strong>3 egg yolks</strong><br><strong>50g caster sugar </strong></p> <p>To finish<br><strong>600ml double cream, whipped to soft peaks</strong><br><strong>25g flaked almonds </strong><br><strong>25g pecans, slightly crushed</strong><br><strong>5 biscotti, crushed</strong></p> <p>Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Grease and line a 33cm x 23cm roll tin with baking paper.</p> <p>First, make the sponge. In a large bowl, whisk the sugar and eggs until light and frothy, then sift in the flour and gently fold in to combine. Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 10-12 minutes, until lightly golden, bouncy and a skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool.</p> <p>Halve and stone the damsons or plums, then put in a wide pan with the sugar, spices, lemon rind and a splash of water. Cook on a high heat for a minute or two, then turn down the heat, cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the fruit is very tender.</p> <p>While the fruit is cooking, make the custard. Heat the cream, vodka (if using) and vanilla pod until just below boiling point. Remove the vanilla pod, split it lengthways and scrape the seeds into the cream mix; leave to cool and infuse. Meanwhile, whisk the eggs and sugar until thick and pale, then whisk in the cream mix. Tip back into the pan, and stir for 10-15 minutes over a medium heat, until the custard thickens and coats the back of a spoon.</p> <p>Now build the trifle. Put the sponge in the base of a transparent, two-litre bowl, pressing it firmly into the base. Spoon over the vodka and some of the cooking juices from the fruit, then spoon the damsons over the sponge, making sure they go right to the edges of the bowl (make sure there are no errant stones). Top the fruit with the custard.</p> <p>Whip the cream to soft peaks and spoon in large dollops on top of the custard. Sprinkle with the crushed pecans, toasted almonds, biscotti and a little extra plum syrup (if you want to gild the lily, grate over 20g of very dark chocolate, too).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/26/borlotti-bean-salad-wild-black-bream-recipes-thomasina-miers\">The weekend cook: Thomasina Miers\u2019 borlotti bean salad and wild black bream recipes</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>And for the rest of the week\u2026</strong></h2> <p>The taleggio bake can very easily be turned into a richer, meatier dish. Dice the cheese into 1cm cubes, then mix with a chopped onion, a crushed clove of garlic and some lardons, then sprinkle over the potatoes before baking. If, like me, you\u2019re looking to use up excess plums or damsons, turn them into a ripple ice-cream. Just double the quantities in the trifle custard, then stir-freeze or churn in an ice-cream machine; pur\u00e9e the fruit and, as the custard thickens, pour it in bit by bit and stir so it ripples through the ice. Bay leaves make a delicious ice-cream, too: infuse them in the cream with the vanilla pod, or poach with the plums (add a vanilla pod or essence for a more classic flavouring). If you have a glut of plums, turn them into jam; vanilla and star anise is just one excellent pairing.</p>",

  "<p>Dante\u2019s Inferno makes little mention of those who profit from the work of others, but cult indie director Abel Ferrara once predicted a special place in the pit of suffering for anyone who dared to remake his classic films. Upon learning that Werner Herzog, the famed German champion of bonkers romanticism, was making a new version of Bad Lieutenant, his scuzzy 1992 tale of a lost soul on the streets of New York, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://gawker.com/393076/charitable-bad-lieutenant-director-wishes-hellish-explosive-death-on-werner-herzog-and-nicolas-cage\">Ferrara seethed</a>: \u201cI wish these people die in hell. I hope they\u2019re all in the same streetcar and it blows up.\u201d</p> <p>At least Herzog\u2019s version, which he <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2008/06/werner_herzog_on_abel_ferrara.html\">cheekily claimed to have made without any knowledge of Ferrara\u2019</a>s existence, turned out to be rather good \u2013 at least if you\u2019re fond of peak-crazy Nicolas Cage and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kknXBbnppzA\">phantasmagorical segues starring imaginary iguanas</a>. Dutch film-maker Paul Verhoeven has had to sit tight as two of his best films, RoboCop (1987) and Total Recall (1990), were remade by lesser mortals with all the verve of a Britpop covers band dashing out Wonderwall.</p> <p>\u201cBoth those movies needed the distance of satire or comedy to situate [the stories] for audiences,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://collider.com/paul-verhoeven-elle-robocop-reboot-interview/\">Verhoeven told Collider</a> in an interview published this week. \u201c\u201cSomehow they seem to think that the lightness of, say, Total Recall and Robocop is a hindrance. So they take these somewhat absurd stories and make them much too serious. I think that is a mistake.\u201d</p> <p>The Dutchman deserves praise for taking a measured approach in his criticism of the folies de grandeur of those who followed him. These other venerable film-makers were not quite so kind.</p> <h2>George Lucas on Star Wars: The Force Awakens</h2> <p>Give Lucas some credit. After selling the rights to the space opera in 2012, he tried his best not to meddle, taking Disney\u2019s decision not to use any of his ideas for a new trilogy good grace and promising instead to return to making \u201cexperimental\u201d movies like his early trifle THX 1138. But after Lucas saw JJ Abrams\u2019 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/16/star-wars-the-force-awakens-review-a-spectacular-homecoming\">blockbuster reboot</a>, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/31/george-lucas-attacks-retro-star-wars-the-force-awakens\">he was unable to contain his contempt</a> for a film that essentially stole half its plot from his original 1977 movie, failed to so much as mention trade federations or <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian\">midi-chlorians</a> and featured no scene set in the riveting galactic senate.</p> <p>Unwisely quipping in an interview with US talkshow host Charlie Rose that he had sold his \u201ckids \u2026 to the white slavers that take these things\u201d, Lucas blurted: \u201cThey wanted to do a retro movie. I don\u2019t like that.\u201d He pointed out that he had worked constantly to innovate during his six-film run in charge of Star Wars, \u201cwith different planets, with different spaceships \u2013 you know, to make it new\u201d. Lucas later apologised to Disney for the \u201cwhite slavers\u201d comment, saying that he had used a \u201cvery inappropriate analogy\u201d.</p> <h2>Alan Parker on the remake of Fame</h2> <p>Despite the director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/24/fame-review\">the 2009 reworking</a>, Kevin Tancharoen, having claimed that Alan Parker was on board, the Bafta-winning British film-maker behind Bugsy Malone and Mississippi Burning likened the experience of finding out his work was to be revisited to being mugged. \u201cI have never had a single phone call from anyone \u2013 the studio, the producers \u2013 about this remake.

I spent months with the kids at the school then spent a year making the movie. You do the work and make it as good as it can be, and you try to protect it.

The thing we did with the second film is that we reinvented the first film completely; spun it on its ass and made the Terminator the good guy, and came up with a whole new concept for a villain. It felt fresh. I didn\u2019t feel the fourth picture was fresh enough. It also lacked a certain stamp of authenticity because Arnold wasn\u2019t in it. I mean, he was in it briefly, digitally, but that\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was bad,\u201d Cameron continued. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was embarrassing. I don\u2019t think he let the franchise down in some huge way, but I did feel some sort of unease.\u201d</p> <p>If you think that sounds like damning with faint praise, Cameron, the director of 1986\u2019s brilliant Alien sequel Aliens, was less positive about the first Alien v Predator movie in 2006. \u201cThey\u2019ve really screwed up the whole franchise,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKnS7CGWNmU\">he told the Daily Habit</a>. </p> <p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LqgdNVTcRA\">Cameron did quite like recent Terminator effort Genisys</a>, praising its innovation and even <a href=\"http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/terminator/32579/james-cameron-on-arnold-schwarzeneggers-ageing-terminator\">contributing a theory about the cyborg ageing process</a> that allowed Schwarzenegger to return as a really knackered T-800.

But zombie movie guru Romero wondered why Snyder excised all the satirical gravy from the original, in which the undead\u2019s surrounding of a shopping mall is a metaphor for the soulless consumerism of American society.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe first 15, 20 minutes were terrific, but it sort of lost its reason for being,\u201d he told Simon Pegg <a href=\"http://www.eatmybrains.com/shownews.php?id=463\">in an interview for Time Out in 2005</a>. \u201cIt was more of a video game.

But everything that had unsettled me about London in the beginning \u2013 the hectic pace, the constant noise, the onslaught of people \u2013 became an essential part of my daily routine, one that gave me comfort.\u201d <em>(Anonymous, moved from Berlin to London in 2013)</em><br></p> <p>\u201cArriving in London was like putting on the best pair of shoes you\u2019ve ever worn. I realised London was my home the day I arrived 32 years ago; it still is. I came to study ballet, and to arrive and swim in such culture-rich waters was a homecoming. Irish by nationality, European by inclination, Londoner by choice ... 32 years and counting.\u201d<em> (Connor Byrne, moved from Limerick to London in 1984)</em></p> <p>\u201cThere have been several moments that made me realise London is my home. The first was when I got the tube for the first time to meet a friend and I didn\u2019t have to use the tube app on my phone to get around. I just strolled straight through the underground with ease.\u201d <em>(Esra Gurkan, moved from Leicester to London in 2015)</em></p> <h2>New York, US</h2> <p>\u201cI began to realise New York City was home when the hustle and bustle became soothing. Also, when you see the same people on the subway every morning, leaving their flats at the same time and getting off at their respective stops. The community feeling comes alive once you have familiar faces during the commute.\u201d <em>(Olivia Graham, moved from Boston to New York in 2014) </em></p> <p>\u201cNew York is the antithesis of the pristine natural beauty and calm in Seattle, where I had a yard. I found it impossible to ignore the roar of the adjacent six-lane highway in my new home. About a year in, I began walking a lot. I realised every walk in New York is an epic saga for people-watching alone, but on top of that, it got me involved in eclectic local communities.\u201d<em> (Helen Brew, moved from Seattle to New York)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9d3490cf6586b5442453046d278af97118b7a10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9d3490cf6586b5442453046d278af97118b7a10/73_731_3635_2181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miraflores neighbourhood of Lima at night\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lima: \u2018I found it huge, noisy, congested\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: zxvisual/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Lima, Peru</h2> <p>\u201cIt was my first time ever living in a big capital city. I found it huge, noisy, congested and I was exhausted and with the feeling of being constantly on guard. I was also amazed by the cultural diversity. I felt at home when I fell asleep on the public transport, when I realised I was able to cross the entire city changing from one bus to another a hundred times and when I was no longer afraid of going out at night and coming back home on my own. Also, when the taxi driver thought I was \u2018lime\u00f1a\u2019 after singing the full lyrics of one salsa song played on the radio. (<em>Patricia, moved from Barcelona to Lima in 2004)</em></p> <h2>Berlin, Germany</h2> <p>\u201cFinding an apartment in Berlin is not easy when you are effectively unemployed, barely speak the language and have not yet amassed all the necessary paperwork. After about nine months of bouncing from sublet to sublet, we found a home of our own. Arriving to collect our keys and seeing our names on the doorbell felt like a massive milestone, even though it was only a tiny one-room apartment.\u201d <em>(Kate, moved from Melbourne to Berlin in 2011)</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/31/how-i-found-my-toronto-thing-when-does-a-city-become-home\">How I found 'my Toronto thing': when does a city become home?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Jakarta, Indonesia</h2> <p>\u201cIt was strange arriving here. People are less likely to smile at strangers. But Jakarta is the most developed city in Indonesia \u2013 you can get everything here. I can order food at 2am delivered right to my door. In Indonesia, that\u2019s awesome. What made it familiar to me was when I realised that Jakarta is the most progressive and open-minded city in Indonesia. I feel safe knowing that.\u201d <em>(Irawan, moved from Malang to Jakarta in 2011)</em> </p> <h2>Ljubljana, Slovenia</h2> <p>\u201cI tried to make Ljubljana mine by making mental perky to-do lists \u2013 walks that would last several hours through the lesser-known parts of the capital, comparing and then bitching about the prices of coffee in the most popular cafes, remembering fun facts about the names of all of the streets that meant something to me (the street where my faculty is located, for instance, is named after an 19th century Slovenian priest who couldn\u2019t resist writing mildly sensual poetry, because he was just too curious). And now, after three years, I can safely say that I have become something else, something more than a tourist and less than an immigrant.\u201d <em>(Marija Jeremi\u0107, moved from U\u017eice to Ljubljana in 2013) </em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ce11fdb4661b293f3e3600e9fa96b71f60e00a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ce11fdb4661b293f3e3600e9fa96b71f60e00a0/0_239_5122_3073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amsterdam woman cycling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amsterdam: \u2018Everyone bikes here.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Desjardin/Moment Editorial/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Amsterdam, the Netherlands</h2> <p>\u201cAmsterdam was so different than the busy, bustling, dirty and unpredictable Athens. Everything was clean, manicured, ordered. It was very alienating at first. I also found it a bit boring. The moment I realised I was home was when I was biking to work \u2013 everyone bikes here \u2013 and I came across some tourists on rented bikes going the wrong way on the bike path. Instead of smiling permissively (which is what my Athenian self would have done), I shot them the \u2018Dutch Blaming Look\u2019: a look of derision and disdain, preserved for everyone who breaks any rule. I myself had been the recipient of that stare many times, and my friends and I had given it its name. The moment I gave that look, I knew that I had become a bona fide Amsterdammer.\u201d <em>(Tania Theodorou, moved from Athens to Amsterdam in 2002) </em></p> <h2>Manchester, UK</h2> <p>\u201cWhen I started riding a bike to work it transformed the way I viewed the city \u2013 everything felt easier to get to, and I felt much calmer. I started really noticing my surroundings for the first time, and appreciating things like the change of seasons. My itchy feet gradually went away, and I finally began to really enjoy living in Manchester.\u201d <em>(Joe Paxton, moved to Manchester in 2007)</em></p> <h2>Katowice, Poland</h2> <p>\u201cEvery day I would walk for hours in the city, getting to know street patterns, nice cafes, local groceries etc. There was this \u2018map Katowice\u2019 project I helped with (the result of which, a map of all buildings in the city colour-coded by age, is stunning), and then I started going to the museum for lectures about local architecture. And if someone would criticise the city, I would defend it.\u201d <em>(Szymon, moved to Katowice in 2012)</em></p> <h2>Austin, US</h2> <p>\u201cI feel more like an Austinite as I have come to terms with nature over the years,. Hearing coyotes howl in the middle of the night (and losing one of our cats to them); our son discovering a scorpion hiding under a pail and being stung; myself needing surgery from a brown recluse spider bite; and pulling a 10-inch long centipede out of a window box planter are some of the highlights. Now we live in Austin\u2019s ever-expanding downtown where the wildlife is more of the alcohol-infused variety, but it still feels like a small town and very much like home.\u201d<em> (Melanie, moved to Austin in 1997) </em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a89f0bcb56fc2f4232900b09c0efcf2d3517c961\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a89f0bcb56fc2f4232900b09c0efcf2d3517c961/0_1383_3446_2066/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Melbourne Domain Park and skyline\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melbourne: \u2018The parks made me feel at home.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chad Ehlers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Melbourne, Australia</h2> <p>\u201cIt was cold, it was confusing, it was foreign. But soon I realised Melbourne has a lot of things that Jakarta doesn\u2019t have. The first thing you notice is proper public transport. Despite the fact that I\u2019ve encountered quite a few locals who complain about the tram being slow, I don\u2019t care. To me, it\u2019s an upgrade from Jakarta\u2019s transport system. The second thing that makes me feel at home are the parks. There aren\u2019t that many open public spaces in Jakarta that are comfortable and relatively non-threatening.\u201d <em tabindex=\"-1\">(Anonymous, moved from Jakarta to Melbourne in 2016)</em></p> <h2>Abu Dhabi, UAE</h2> <p>\u201cWhen we first arrived in Abu Dhabi, we greeted our new city somewhat treading precariously. But we soon realised that there can indeed be many homes for those living the expatriate life. Being Indians in the Middle East means you can feel relaxed knowing that India is a short flight away and the city is inhabited by others hailing from the Asian subcontinent. </p> <p>What really clinched it for me was the taxi drivers and their warmth. A Pakistani taxi driver who goes out of his way to make an Indian passenger feel welcome and comfortable in today\u2019s world when the two countries are embroiled in political turmoil speaks volumes of people and their need for camaraderie that can make them forget all else.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Home is instinctively waking up from a nap seconds before it\u2019s time to step out at my intended metro stop</p> <footer> <cite>Sarah McMahon-Sperber</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These taxi drivers in Abu Dhabi certainly fuelled a feeling of comfort in me and reinstated that belief that echoes in many of us: that home is where the heart is, and where you find good people to share it with.\u201d <em>(Anonymous, moved from Munich to Abu Dhabi in 2015) </em></p> <h2>Oslo, Norway</h2> <p>\u201cOslo felt like a quiet, small village in comparison to the hustle and bustle of London. I took the ferry from Harwich to Gothenburg and drove to Oslo, my first long solo drive. I realised I was home in Oslo when I started to read Jo Nesb\u00f8 (in English) and I recognised all the landmarks and areas he described and understood the Norwegian characters and their quirks.\u201d <em>(Homa Jansen, moved from London to Oslo in 1997) </em></p> <h2>Dubai, UAE</h2> <p>\u201cThere used to be no street signs in Dubai \u2013 strange for such an advanced city \u2013 and with the rapid growth, roads and intersections were changing every other day, so navigating the city was via landmarks (like the \u2018clocktower roundabout\u2019 in Bur Dubai), buildings, or billboards. You\u2019ve finally clicked with the city when you\u2019re able to get from A to Z easily.\u201d <em>(Olivia Roqua, moved from Australia to Dubai in 2010)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"24a4f502852ad404ea0d00e6d42ad63431b6e0f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24a4f502852ad404ea0d00e6d42ad63431b6e0f4/28_128_1341_805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Montreal metro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Montreal: \u2018Home is knowing which of the network\u2019s hallways have the best acoustics.\u2019 Photograph: <a href=\"http://www.chrismforsyth.com/\">Chris M Forsyth</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris M Forsyth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Montreal, Canada</h2> <p>\u201cThirteen years in, I often describe my relationship with Montreal as my longest love affair. Just like any love affair, our beginnings were ravenous. I wanted to know Montreal intimately. I went looking for her in the city\u2019s restaurants, bars, parks and festivals; and I found hints of her in these iconic and tangible spaces. But my real sense of understanding came when I started intuitively navigating the city\u2019s metro system.</p> <p>All of a sudden, something clicked. I started carving paths for myself across the whole city. I knew where to wait for the doors to open in a busy crowd, knew which end of the platform to embark on depending on my final station, knew which of six confusing exits would take me exactly where I needed to go. I like to think I literally know parts of Montreal inside and out.</p> <p>These days, I\u2019ve been making a point of stopping to read all of the plaques around the metro network. Turns out, there are tons of them sprinkled across the city, and they tell rich and insightful stories. They help me add context and intricacy to my city\u2019s narrative.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/04/vienna-migration-crisis-refugees-refuge-cities-residents\">After the flood: Vienna's struggle to make its refugee residents feel at home</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since I first arrived here, my definition and sense of home has changed. I\u2019ve found home in a feeling and in the familiar rhythm down new metro steps. Home is in the three notes that play right before Montreal\u2019s metro staff announce a system-wide shut down. Home is instinctively waking up from a nap seconds before it\u2019s time to step out at my intended metro stop. Home is knowing which of the network\u2019s hallways have the best acoustics and echo. Today, home is most definitely Montreal.\u201d <em>(Sarah McMahon-Sperber, moved to Montreal in 2003) </em></p> <h2>Brussels, Belgium</h2> <p>\u201cBelgium is a notoriously hard country to integrate into, but after the bombings in March this year I have felt more a part of the social fabric than ever before. I have spoken to many people outside of my normal social structures and I now feel like Belgium is my turf. All our opinions matter and we all need to share our experiences; this process brings us closer together.\u201d <em>(Anonymous, moved from Dublin to Brussels in 2001)</em></p> <h2>Paris, France</h2> <p>\u201cI knew I was well-assimilated the first time I dropped my keys and said \u2018<em>merde</em>\u2019 to myself instead of its English equivalent.\u201d <em>(John Agee, moved from Los Angeles to Paris in 2006) </em></p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and join the discussion</em></p>",

It\u2019s in that context that the hype for the original Blair Witch Project should be remembered \u2013 it\u2019s almost inconceivable that a marketing campaign which hinges on suggesting to the public that the events contained in a horror film are real could succeed now, when a simple Google would reveal the actors\u2019 digital footprint for all to see.

Counter-terrorism detectives are hunting for the 24-year-old, but believe he may have crossed the border into Syria to join Isis.</p> <p>Syeedy and Kadir, from Rochdale and Oldham respectively, developed a hatred of Uddin last summer after discovering he practised a form of Islamic healing called taweez<em>, </em>the court was told.</p> <p>Uddin moved to Rochdale 15 years ago from Bangladesh. The former imam was well known in the area for his use of healing amulets to ward off ill health and protect people from evil spirits.</p> <p>Uddin\u2019s friends warned that the killing had left an open wound in Rochdale\u2019s Muslim community, as his family paid tribute to a \u201cgreatly respected man, a caring and loving soul\u201d.</p> <p>Uddin\u2019s relatives said they had been \u201cleft empty\u201d by his murder in a statement released by police.</p> <p>\u201cWe came to court to seek answers from Mohammed Hassan Syeedy. He has shown no remorse or sympathy towards Jalal or his family, as indicative of his attitude and demeanour throughout the last four weeks,\u201d the family said.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough Jalal was a Muslim who peacefully practised his faith, he had a love and respect for all religions, cultures and creeds, and the fact that he was murdered by someone inspired by Isil shows the true nature and barbarity of this organisation and those who serve it.\u201d</p> <p>In a victim impact statement read to court, one of Uddin\u2019s seven children, Sala al-Arif, said his father told him two days before he died that he planned later this year to return to Bangladesh for the first time in 15 years to see his wife, children and grandchildren.</p> <p>Instead, he said, his relatives have been left with an \u201ceverlasting void\u201d. Al-Arif said that when he visited his father\u2019s body in the mortuary he was \u201cdenied the most basic human right\u201d to kiss his father\u2019s face because of the horrific injuries he had suffered.</p> <p>Describing his father as a \u201cdevout pacifist who showed nothing but love to anyone he came across,\u201d Al-Arif said Uddin\u2019s relatives had been left without answers as to why he was targeted: \u201cI cannot begin to understand why anyone would want to murder him. This is the ultimate question for me and my family: why was my father murdered?\u201d<br></p> <p>Jurors were told that Syeedy and Kadir, who were not known to the police, believed Uddin\u2019s use of<em> </em>taweez was black magic and that he deserved to be killed.</p> <p>Uddin, known as the Qari Saab by his followers for his deep understanding of the Qur\u2019an, was mocked as a magician by Syeedy and his friends, who nicknamed him Voldemort after the evil wizard in the Harry Potter books.<br></p> <p>Six months before the murder, Syeedy and his friends destroyed Uddin\u2019s notes and books on taweez after stealing them from their mosque. They then started monitoring Uddin\u2019s whereabouts, taking covert pictures of him in the street, as they plotted to have the community leader deported by immigration services.</p> <p>But that plan was abandoned after a photograph emerged of Uddin with the Rochdale MP, Simon Danczuk, outside the Jalalia mosque in December last year.

Whoever succeeded Nigel Farage was likely to plunge Ukip into charisma deficit but, on the basis of that speech, Diane James seems remarkably bland. To her credit, though, she acknowledged quite openly that she was not a colourful character. \u201cI am not Nigel-like, I am not even Nigel-lite,\u201d she said. You certainly can\u2019t argue with that.</p> <p>Still, dull and sensible is not always a bad thing in politics and, although James did not say anything particularly specific in her speech, she did give some indication as to what sort of leader she will be. She stressed the importance of Ukip having a credible manifesto and she said the party should be offering \u201cpragmatic\u201d solutions to the country\u2019s problems. That means the era of bonkers ideas like<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/04/15/ukip-2015-manifesto_n_7068920.html\"> compulsory uniforms for taxi drivers </a>is definitely over. By Ukip standards it was a remarkably moderate speech. The only line that slightly jarred was her claim that Ukip was the \u201copposition party in waiting\u201d (a touch of David Steel telling the Liberals to go back to their constituencies and \u201cprepare for government\u201d?) But she compensated for that with a reasonably good line about the Conservatives and \u201cmagpie May\u201d stealing Ukip policies.</p> <p>But that only raised the question that Alexander Phillips (see<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/16/ukip-conference-nigel-farages-last-speech-as-leader-politics-live?page=with:block-57dbb0f0e4b067ad3008849c#block-57dbb0f0e4b067ad3008849c\"> 9.51am)</a> and others have been asking: if Theresa May is adopting Ukip policies, then what is the role for Ukip? Like Farage earlier, James said Ukip would be insisting that Brexit does actually materialise, but she sounded far less suspicious on this front than Farage did and her demands (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/16/ukip-conference-nigel-farages-last-speech-as-leader-politics-live?page=with:block-57dbebcce4b0e813b694da80#block-57dbebcce4b0e813b694da80\">1.57pm) </a>sounded much the same as Liam Fox and David Davis\u2019s. In fact, about the only thing she said that would have sounded out of place in a speech at the Conservative party conference was her attack on first-past-the-post.</p> <p>And that\u2019s why Labour will be pleased by the speech. Ukip lead by a working-class leader with a northern accent committed to blue collar issues would have been a huge threat to Jeremy Corbyn. A party led by someone who sounds like a Tory is much less of a worry.</p> <p>But in one respect, at least, James\u2019s election should make Labour feel uncomfortable. The Tories are on their second female leader, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the DUP all have female leaders, the Greens have one too, but the only parties yet to get in on the act are the UK\u2019s two biggest \u201cprogressive\u201d ones, Labour and the Lib Dems.

(See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/16/ukip-conference-nigel-farages-last-speech-as-leader-politics-live?page=with:block-57dac330e4b0e813b694d5b0#block-57dac330e4b0e813b694d5b0\"> 9.18am.) </a>It is very rare to see a politician stand down having succeeded so completely in his own terms and, if this speech was triumphalist, then that was understandable. But in fact it was more reflective than smug, and Farage was very interesting as he reminisced on how Ukip had emerged from nothing, and how PR (for the European elections) was absolutely crucial to the party\u2019s success. Whether electoral reformers will regard that as good or bad for their case is another matter.</p> <p>Otherwise, by Farage\u2019s standards, it was relatively low key. Apart from taking a swipe at Neil Hamilton, he avoided the temptation to engage in internal party score-settling. (Perhaps he got that out of his system<a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/farage-on-carswell-i-dont-know-why-he-joined-10579532\"> with Sky.) </a>Instead he gave us some clues as to what he will be doing next: supporting leave movements in other EU countries, and building up a profile in the US. He repeated his claim that Ukip has a huge opportunity to take votes from Labour. And, interestingly, he set three tests for Brexit. Two of those may well be achieved by 2020: British passports (preferably old-style blue, hard-cover, inconveniently-sized ones, he implied) and withdrawal from the single market. But the chances of Britain having exclusive access to fishing waters up to 200 miles off the coast are slight because EU countries almost certainly would not accept this, and the threat of retaliatory measures would make it not worth the risk (<a href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7669\">see this House of Commons briefing paper)</a>.

The party is at once libertarian and authoritarian. It preaches individual freedom but contains admirers of Vladimir Putin. It wants to privatise the National Health Service, apart from when it does not. It has flirted with both a tax on luxury goods and deep tax cuts for the richest. It hems and haws on gay marriage, halal food and the burkini. It is vague about what sort of immigrants Britain should let in, and in what numbers. Even on the EU it is utterly divided: some (like Mr Carswell) want Britain outside the union to become a European Singapore, while others (like Aaron Banks, the forthright businessman who bankrolled the party\u2019s pro-Brexit efforts) want something more like a return to the 1950s.</p> <p>All parties, and especially populist ones, contain a range of views. Yet they tend to congregate around certain stretches of the political spectrum. Founded in pursuit of Brexit alone, UKIP has no such common ground. On sprawling, defining themes like the vocation of the state, the meaning of nationhood, the interaction of public and private spheres, and the roles of pluralism, globalisation and citizenship in modern societies it has no continuity and is irredeemably at odds with itself. That inhibits it from establishing and sticking to the sort of long-term strategy it needs to become and remain more professional.</p> <p>This points to a grim cycle. The last time Mr Farage resigned, UKIP tumbled. For 11 ignominious months Lord Pearson, a languidly aristocratic former Tory, trashed his party\u2019s prospects: in a television interview shortly before the 2010 election he appeared not even to have read its 14-page manifesto. All of which may now repeat itself. \u201cOne quite plausible possibility is we end up with a re-run of the Lord Pearson experience: a year or two of messy and incoherent leadership under a figure not cut out for the big leagues, then Farage comes back,\u201d suggests Robert Ford, a UKIP expert at Manchester University. The fact is that UKIP\u2019s weaknesses point to Mr Farage\u2019s weird genius. Besides the quest for Brexit, his unique schtick was all the party had. Now, again, it may be its only salvation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57daccf8e4b067ad3008811c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-16T09:00:54.697Z\">10.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Nigel Farage on Ukip's NEC</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier I quoted what<strong> Nigel Farage</strong> had to say about Ukip\u2019s national executive committee.

It is called the National Executive Committee. Many of its current crop are among the lowest grade of people I have ever met. To them, being a member of the governing body of Britain\u2019s third-largest political party is the equivalent of scaling Everest.</p> <p>People with no qualification in business or politics make the ultimate decisions of whom should be our candidate at a by-election. Or whether the former disgraced Tory MP Neil Hamilton should be given a route back to public life via being elected as an Assembly Member in Wales. It may sound odd to many but I have been a moderniser in Ukip. I have been fought at every step of the way by total amateurs who come to London once a month with sandwiches in their rucksacks, to attend NEC meetings that normally last seven hours.</p> <p>The new Leader of Ukip should bypass the vanity of such people and make big decisions about Ukip\u2019s future via direct polling of the membership. Yes of course, it brings risk but in a way we get back to the Brexit referendum result. Do you trust the political class or the people? Ukip must trust its members.

Its supporters would claim that it is the most successful party in the history of British politics. Its detractors would claim that it is one of the most shambolic and useless. Both descriptions are reasonably accurate.</p> <p>Ukip has only won one national election (the European elections in 2014) and it only has one MP, but if you judge a party by whether it has achieved its key objective, then Ukip\u2019s record is hard to fault. Just over 20 years after it was founded, it got exactly what it wanted: a referendum on EU membership, and a vote to leave. No other party can make this boast. There is an argument to be had about quite how important a part Ukip played in the EU referendum campaign itself. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/09/douglas-carswell-im-having-far-too-much-fun-lo-leave-ukip\">(Douglas Carswell, Ukip\u2019s only MP, told the Guardian at the weekend that leave only won because Vote Leave ignored the approach favoured by Ukip\u2019s leader Nigel Farage.)</a> But Ukip was decisive in ensuring that the referendum was held in the first place. David Cameron has a hearty dislike for Farage and Ukip, and he conceded a referendum because he was under pressure to do so from Tory MPs, but those Tories had leverage because the Ukip started soaring after the 2010 general election and Cameron concluded that, without offering a referendum, the Conservative party could not win in 2015 (and/or he could not survive as leader).<br></p> <p>But, organisationally, Ukip is also a total disaster. In fact, it is so riven with hate and feuding that it makes Labour relatively harmonious.

  "<p>Barack Obama\u2019s announcement that the United States proposes to admit 110,000 refugees over the course of the next year has elicited a <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/14/outgoing-obama-plans-to-increase-refugees-by-twenty-nine-percent-next-year/\">furious</a> reaction from some Republican leaders. This was predictable. A spirit of xenophobia has once again taken hold in the United States, as has happened on several previous occasions in American history.</p> <p>As early as 1798, just a few years after the establishment of the Republic, Congress adopted a Naturalization law that was intended to keep out radicals who could promote sedition. The main targets were the French, who might spread the \u201cJacobin\u201d ideology of the French Revolution. In the 19th century, a focus of exclusion was the Chinese who were explicitly kept out under the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. That law was not repealed until 1943, when it became embarrassing because China was an ally of the United States in the war against Japan. In the early part of the 20th century, a number of measures were adopted to limit the admission of southern Europeans, such as the Italians, ostensibly because they were thought to be more likely to spread the anarchist ideology than fairer-skinned immigrants from northern Europe. And so things have gone.</p> <p>Today, of course, the main focus of those denouncing Obama\u2019s proposal is Syrian refugees. Up to now, the United States has admitted a few more than 10,000. So far, at least, their resettlement in the United States has seemed to go very well, though Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, has tried to keep them out of his state.</p> <p>Additional refugees from Syria would constitute a minority of those that Obama proposes to admit over the next year. The number projected for all countries in the Middle East and South Asia is 40,000. Yet in this election year, in which the Republican nominee for president swept aside his opponents for the nomination by saying he would deport 11 million undocumented immigrants from Mexico, and he would bar all Muslims from entering the United States, has made xenophobia look like a winning political strategy.</p> <p>As should be apparent, a wealthy country of 320 million people can easily absorb 110,000 refugees. In the year that ends 30 September, America\u2019s goal has been 85,000 refugees. The increase is modest given the scale of the global refugee crisis. It compares poorly to neighboring Canada, with a population just over ten percent of the United States. </p> <p>In the brief period between 15 November 2015 and 29 February 2016, Canada admitted 25,000 Syrian refugees, as well as many refugees from other countries. As Canada\u2019s highly popular Prime Minister Justin Trudeau does not have political opponents trying to win office by exploiting xenophobia, the absorption of the Syrian refugees has been accepted not only approvingly but enthusiastically by the great majority of Canadians. A large number of the refugees have been sponsored by Canadian church groups, parent-teacher associations and other non-governmental organizations that have paid the initial costs of resettlement, and helped the refugees to find homes, learn English, get jobs and get their children into schools. </p> <p>Canada carefully screens refugees accepted for resettlement. So does the United States. Typically, the American screening program for refugees lasts more than a year. That is possible when an orderly program is established. It is one of the reasons that a refugee program such as that conducted by Canada, and the one under which the United States admitted 10,000 Syrian refugees in the past year, tends to succeed. </p> <p>I don\u2019t think Americans are inherently more xenophobic than their Canadian neighbors. In such matters, as in much else, political opportunism plays a big role. It seems to bring out the worst in many people, including those denouncing the president\u2019s modest proposal.</p>",

  "<p>I have never been shy of a&#xa0;challenge. I practise as a priest, but in my spare time I have climbed Mount Everest, sailed around the world and trekked to the North Pole.</p> <p>I first knew I wanted to fly around the world in a hot-air balloon in the early 90s, when the race between Bertrand Piccard, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/10/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-interview\">Richard Branson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fossett\">Steve Fossett</a> began. Finally, in 2002, Steve Fossett <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jul/02/4\">managed to fly solo</a> after six attempts. I wanted to be the first to do it on the first attempt.</p> <p>For the last two years I trained extensively, spending 150 hours in balloons. This summer, aged 64, I&#xa0;was in Northam, Western Australia, waiting for a weather window. I chose to fly east: across Australia, over the Pacific, South America, the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean.</p> <p>With my ground team, I spent 24 hours preparing the balloon, fuel and capsule. It took us 10 hours to spread it out across the airfield, connect all the parts and fill it with 10,000 cubic metres of helium.</p> <p>Thousands of people had gathered to witness the launch on 12 July and, at 7.33am, I took off. It was perfectly executed, with a smooth and steady ascent. I was wildly excited but had some doubts \u2013 I was venturing into the unknown. I couldn\u2019t guarantee I\u2019d see my friends and family again.</p> <p>My living area inside the gondola was a capsule, a carbon fibre box 2m x 1.8m. It was designed to float if I&#xa0;landed in water, but having sailed around the world four times I&#xa0;knew I&#xa0;wouldn\u2019t be able to survive the harshness of the Southern Ocean in it. I&#xa0;didn\u2019t stop watching the weather, communicating with my land team and changing altitude to optimise the speed and direction. As I passed New Zealand and entered the space above the Pacific, I felt an incredible sense of relief, because there is less air traffic over the sea.</p> <p>Above 5,000 metres you need an oxygen mask to survive. On my fifth day, I was flying over the Pacific at 8,500 metres when I noticed the safety valve on my oxygen cylinder was faulty and I was losing oxygen. It was terrifying. I managed to save myself from suffocating by climbing on to the roof of the gondola and adjusting the pressure in the cylinder to stop the oxygen escaping.</p> <p>I was on standby 24 hours a day, freezing cold, sleep deprived and lonely, but I never questioned why I&#xa0;was doing this. It is such a unique experience to see our beautiful planet from the gondola: it gave me a sense of how small it is. Being on constant watch eliminated the sense of time. It was an 11-day state of wakefulness, with half-hour naps here and there. Even when sleeping, part of my brain was still listening and sensing the situation. I had to constantly stay alert to control the flight, altitude, my&#xa0;oxygen flow, and to look out for cumulonimbus clouds, because they are a sign of atmospheric instability. I&#xa0;had to hold a spoon between two fingers to keep myself awake: if I&#xa0;dozed off, it would fall and clang against the floor, waking me up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/26/experience-bitten-by-rabid-bat\">Experience: I was bitten by a rabid bat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Temperatures reached -50C. Over the Atlantic, the gondola was covered in a thin layer of frost. Flying at 9,000m at 200km an hour, I&#xa0;climbed out to chip the ice off the burners for an hour until they restarted.</p> <p>Nine days in, I was caught in a&#xa0;thunderstorm over the Indian Ocean for three hours. To avoid the lightning, I had to fly at 10,500m, a&#xa0;very dangerous height. I thought I&#xa0;was going to die. It was both physically and emotionally draining. Luckily, I&#xa0;managed to spot a narrow gap between the belt of huge clouds and find a calmer course.</p> <p>Seeing the coast of Australia again on my 11th day was a huge relief. I&#xa0;knew my journey was nearly over. It was to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/russian-priest-in-hot-air-balloon-flies-round-the-world-in-record-time\">a new world record</a>. I could see my team celebrating below as I&#xa0;flew over. After a bumpy landing, my hatch was opened and I saw the faces of my friends and family. It hit me when I was finally able to stand on the ground and hug my sons Oscar and Nikolay. Flying for 11 days solo, thousands of metres above the ground, and then all of a sudden seeing familiar faces was a relief beyond words. This challenge really pushed me to my limits, but it hasn\u2019t put me off. Next year, I want to fly 15&#xa0;miles into the stratosphere, breaking the record for the highest ever hot-air balloon flight.</p> <p>\u2022 As told to Jack Dutton.</p> <p>Do you have an experience to share?

But we fall on it like pack animals, hooting with pleasure.</p> <p>Nor is onion and anchovy tart (aka pissaladi\u00e8re) particularly challenging.

How can something so mundane taste so magical? Turns out that, far from mundane, it\u2019s outlandishly complex: veal and pork spiked with chicken liver, bacon, ricotta, parmesan, chervil, fennel seeds, thyme, black pepper and breadcrumbs soaked in milk, all cooked with white wine, butter, tarragon and cream.

Cliched old ratatouille is translated into a big-boned, chunky, smoky beast of a thing. Dishes are wood-fired or baked; if anything this urbane could be described as rustic, I\u2019d go for that. Lamb is treated almost primitively \u201c\u00e0 la ficelle\u201d: strung up over open flames and cooked slowly, then slapped with the most unphotogenic mess of white beans and \u201cgreen sauce\u201d thrumming with Proven\u00e7al-style herbs and garlic. Pretty it ain\u2019t, but who cares when it\u2019s so thrilling? And yes, actual main courses, not the almost mandatory-in-London \u201csuccession of small plates\u201d.

  "<h2><strong>Day 1</strong></h2> <p><strong>Morning<br></strong>Start with a tour of the city\u2019s most historic district, the St. Lawrence neighbourhood. Local historian/man-about-town <a href=\"http://www.brucebelltours.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bruce Bell</a> will show you interesting views of the <a href=\"http://www.stlawrencemarket.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">St. Lawrence Market</a> (proclaimed best in the world by National Geographic) \u2013 and the historic town jail. The market is filled with everything from water buffalo sliders to smoked teriyaki salmon and fresh raspberries as deep and red as the Maple Leaf flag.</p> <p>Stop in the market for a class Canadian lunch: a peameal bacon sandwich at <a href=\"http://www.stlawrencemarket.com/vendors/vendor_detail/56\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carousel Bakery</a>. For about \u00a34 (C$7), you\u2019ll get thick, juicy slices of bacon that are really more like cured ham. Other options at the market include tasty veal or chicken sandwiches drenched in tomato sauce (and saut\u00e9ed onions, peppers and mushrooms) at <a href=\"http://www.unomustachio.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uno Mustachio</a>. Want something more formal? The highly rated <a href=\"http://www.biagioristorante.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Biagio</a> is nearby.</p> <p><strong>Afternoon<br></strong>From the market, head east on the Queen streetcar to The Beaches neighbourhood. Toronto has a series of fine beaches along Lake Ontario, with boardwalks and bike trails that march for miles alongside shady parks. There\u2019s decent swimming in summer, as well as stand-up paddle boarding and beach volleyball played by athletic, youthful locals. If that\u2019s your thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5ae21d6d4d98b18ed50e399d98c46e2089f9801\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5ae21d6d4d98b18ed50e399d98c46e2089f9801/0_190_5100_3061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Take a walk along the boardwalks looping around Lake Ontario and check out the beach volleyball action.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Take a walk along the boardwalks looping around Lake Ontario and check out the beach volleyball action.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Education Images/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Evening<br></strong>Stop in at the Distillery District for a local lager or ale at <a href=\"http://millstreetbrewery.com/toronto-brew-pub/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mill Street Brew Pub</a>. There are indoor and outdoor seating areas with great views of the restored industrial sheen of this historic district, once part of the Gooderham and Worts distilling empire.

For food, <a href=\"http://www.elcatrin.ca/home\" rel=\"nofollow\">El Catrin</a> restaurant has a terrific patio or the super-colourful mural indoors is an equally impressive backdrop. Try the guacamole, which they make at your table, or the pork tacos.</p> <h2><strong>Day 2</strong></h2> <p><strong>Morning<br></strong>Try breakfast at <a href=\"http://www.overeasyrestaurants.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Over Easy</a>, a nice cafe with just the right ambience on Yonge Street. If you want something lighter (and with fancier coffee), head instead to <a href=\"http://dineencoffee.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dineen</a>, just a few blocks north.</p> <p>To really appreciate Toronto, you need to visit one of the city parks when the weather is nice.

A trip to the <a href=\"http://www.torontoisland.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toronto Islands</a> also allows you the park experience <em>plus</em> a short ferry ride (but come early to avoid crowds). Alternatively, check out quiet waterways by canoe, or admire the refurbished homes on Ward\u2019s Island.

A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/28/hold-off-applying-for-passport-ireland-tells-britons\">surge in applications for Irish</a> and other EU passports suggests many Britons are keen to carry on enjoying unfettered access to work opportunities within Europe.</p> <p>With so many varied and interesting countries to choose from, deciding where to pack up and move to can be hard. Thanks to open data on what it is like to live in different cities, some of the guesswork has already been done. After combining a range of publicly available datasets, for example, it turns out the UK rates as pretty average when it comes to good work-life balance and the amount of money a typical worker loses as a result of traffic congestion. It will come as no surprise to discover that compared with the rest of the world, London is one of the most expensive places to study.</p> <p>These insights are made possible by analytics companies combining datasets and adding a human element to typically economic figures. Through this they can gain insight into what it is actually like to work in different cities.</p> <p>For budding tech leaders, a useful case study comes from Bobbi Brant, a researcher at <a href=\"http://www.expertmarket.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ExpertMarket.com</a>. She decided to see if the assumption that Silicon Valley is the only tech hub to head for stands up to scrutiny. She combined each major tech hub\u2019s reputation for launching startups, the level of finance raised, salary levels and time taken to launch a company, information available from startup researchers <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.compass.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Compass</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The World Bank\u2019s</a> open data service. She then cross-referenced lifestyle data from living index <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Numbeo</a> for the cost of living, rent levels, holiday entitlement and commute times. With the four economic and four personal datasets given even weighting, it was a surprise to find that San Francisco was not the number one tech hub in the world. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.expertmarket.com/focus/research/top-tech-hubs\" rel=\"nofollow\">That honour fell to Berlin</a>.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of reports into tech hubs are based on economic data but that\u2019s of more use to investors than young people starting out on a career,\u201d she points out. \u201cIt\u2019s no good looking to work in the hub with most investment if you can\u2019t afford to live there or the work-life balance is wrong for you. So, when you add data on affordability and lifestyle, Berlin comes out top with Silicon Valley in fourth spot. London\u2019s way down the table at 16th because of the high cost of living.\u201d</p> <h2>Better balance</h2> <p>Similar recent studies from ExpertMarket.com have also named the city where workers can expect the best work-life balance and parents will lose the least sleep fretting about paying university fees. For each study the site\u2019s content manager, Jessica Laporte, started with open data on average earnings from Swiss bank UBS. For the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://blog.expertmarket.co.uk/work-life-balance\" rel=\"nofollow\">education project</a> they were correlated with average university fees and college rankings from researchers at <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/subject-rankings/2016\" rel=\"nofollow\">QS</a>. For the work-life balance <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://blog.expertmarket.co.uk/work-life-balance\" rel=\"nofollow\">project</a>, the amount of holiday people take was combined with average earnings figures. In both studies, France won.</p> <p>\u201cParis is obviously the place to work and study because the French work more than a thousand hours fewer than Hong Kong, which provided the worst work-life balance,\u201d Brant says.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK is 17th out of 70 countries and so not nearly as bad as some people who feel overworked might suspect. France is also the most affordable country, where fees apply, for parents to fund their children through university, with the Scandinavian countries all in good positions just behind it.\u201d</p> <h2>Stuck in traffic</h2> <p>Combining extra datasets gives an extra understanding around commute times, or rather the implications behind congestion. Josh Frisby, content manager at vehicle tracking company Global Positioning Specialists, combined average salaries around the world with data on commuting distance at Numbeo alongside congestion levels published by TomTom. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.gps.com.au/earnings-lost-to-congestion-around-the-world\" rel=\"nofollow\">result</a> was a table for the cities where workers driving to the office waste the most amount of time, in terms of wages lost to traffic jams. Mexico City was way out ahead as the worst but, surprisingly, British and American cities did not perform as badly as Frisby had expected.</p> <p>\u201cIn Mexico City the average person could earn nearly 10% more if they weren\u2019t stuck in traffic jams,\u201d says Frisby. \u201cWe were really surprised that Los Angeles and New York only came out 19th and 26th respectively and that London is only the 16th worst city for the cost of traffic jams. It was also surprising to see that Manchester was just behind the capital in 20th place, meaning people lose more money in Manchester driving to work in heavy traffic than they do in cities you would presume would be much worse, such as New York, San Francisco, Paris and Singapore.\u201d</p> <h2>Apac cost of living</h2> <p>Anyone considering moving further afield, as far as Australia or the wider Asia Pacific area, might want to check out a new, free online service which compares the cost of living in eight of the region\u2019s major cities. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://webapps.qlik.com/costofliving-apac/index.html#/\" rel=\"nofollow\">comparison website</a> has been launched by data analyst company Qlik. Senior solution architect Stephen Street explains the service uses a combination of data services, such as Numbeo and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PropertyGuru</a> to enable a like-for-like comparison between the region\u2019s top business destinations.</p> <p>\u201cWe want the service to be truly useful to anyone comparing Apac cities,\u201d Street says. \u201cSo we have a general, average comparison, where Tokyo is the most expensive city and Mumbai is far and away the cheapest. However, we also allow people to tailor the data to their lifestyle. You can compare the cost of living for someone who likes to eat out and drink, or perhaps buy designer clothes. Then Singapore and Sydney become more expensive to live in than Tokyo. As you change the settings the table changes so you can match your lifestyle to the city that appeals the most.\u201d</p> <p>Before the era of open data, comparing what it is like to live and work in different cities was largely a case of testimonials from locals and expats. However, now, anyone wondering if they could have a better standard of living abroad can find out online from a combination of data sources. Ironically, the open data projects may well persuade many that the UK is not such a bad place after all. </p> <p>However, for those who are determined to have it all \u2013 low-cost education, low congestion and a good work-life balance \u2013 it may well be time to dust off the French phrasebook and head for the Eurostar.</p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong><br></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cPaid for by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sponsored-content\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>",
  "<p>The European Union is in a critical situation, Angela Merkel has said, as she arrived in Bratislava for a special summit \u2013 without the UK \u2013 that hopes to set a new course for a project battered by Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to show with our actions that we can get better,\u201d the German chancellor said. The bloc had to improve \u201cin the domain of security, internal and external security, the fight against terrorism, the cooperation in the field of defence\u201d, as well as defence and jobs, she added. </p> <p>Donald Tusk, the European council president who chairs EU leaders\u2019 summits, hopes to cool tempers in Slovakia after Luxembourg\u2019s foreign minister called for Hungary to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/expel-hungary-from-eu-for-hostility-to-refugees-says-luxembourg\">thrown out of the EU</a> for allegedly treating asylum seekers \u201cworse than wild animals\u201d. Hungary counterattacked with stinging criticism of the grand duchy\u2019s record in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/05/-sp-luxembourg-tax-files-tax-avoidance-industrial-scale\">helping big corporations avoid tax</a>.</p> <p>On the eve of the summit, Tusk called on EU leaders to take a \u201cbrutally honest\u201d look at the bloc\u2019s problems, declaring: \u201cWe must not let this crisis go to waste.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t come to Bratislava to comfort each other or even worse to deny the real challenges we face in this particular moment in the history of our community after the vote in the UK,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t start our discussion ... with this kind of blissful conviction that nothing is wrong, that everything was and is OK,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have to assure ... our citizens that we have learned the lesson from Brexit and we are able to bring back stability and a sense of security and effective protection.\u201d</p> <p>The Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico, who is hosting the summit, said the leaders \u201call want to show unity\u201d but warned that it would not be easy.</p> <p>\u201cAfter Brexit and the risks connected with Brexit, it is absolutely necessary to me to be very honest,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Tusk hopes to focus on areas that the 27 leaders can agree on: border security, counter-terrorism and moves to \u201cbring back control of globalisation\u201d. Officials are playing down expectations of results from the meeting at Bratislava castle, in the capital of Slovakia, one of the four Visegr\u00e1d countries along with Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. <br></p> <p>The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, promised that the Visegr\u00e1d group would present a plan to tackle the EU\u2019s problems, which he said would \u201cbe an important moment in the life of these four countries\u201d.</p> <p>In a radio interview released on Friday morning, Orb\u00e1n also said he expected migration pressure to increase in the Balkans again, once the weather worsens and sea routes to Italy become more difficult.</p> <p>Officials close to Tusk hope for small but symbolic breakthroughs, most notably an agreement to send an extra 200 border guards and 50 vehicles to the EU\u2019s external frontier in Bulgaria by next month.</p> <p>Agreeing on stronger border defences may prove easier than sharing the cost of protecting refugees, which is likely to continue to strain unity. Visegr\u00e1d group members are fiercely opposed to the EU executive\u2019s attempts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/03/eu-refugee-crisis-closed-door-countries-pay-solidarity-contributions\">fine them for not accepting refugees</a> in their countries. Hungary has flatly refused to take in refugees under an EU quota scheme, while many other countries are falling short.</p> <p>Orb\u00e1n has called a referendum for 2 October on the EU relocation plan, under which the country would accept 1,294 asylum seekers.</p> <p>Before the vote, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, appeared to offer an olive branch to his opponents. In his annual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/juncker-european-unity-brexit-vote-eu\">state of the union address,</a> he said solidarity \u201cmust come from the heart\u201d and could not be forced. One EU source said it was too early to say what this meant for the policy, describing it as \u201ca semi step back by the commission that might be a useful way out\u201d. Another EU official said the dispute was \u201ca cancer we have to cure\u201d.</p> <p>In the citadel that towers over the Danube, Tusk will brief leaders on his recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/donald-tusk-theresa-may-article-50-brexit-negotiations-eu\">meeting with the British prime minister</a>, Theresa May, although officials say there is little to report. The EU refuses to negotiate with the UK until the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/government-awaits-first-legal-opposition-to-brexit-in-high-court\">government triggers article 50</a>, a position that is likely to be reaffirmed at the summit. EU leaders are also likely to repeat the mantra that Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/28/brussels-eu-summit-leaders-push-quick-divorce-cameron-germany-brexit\">must accept freedom of movement</a> in order to gain access to the single market.<br></p> <p>In a recent letter to EU leaders, Tusk said it would be \u201ca fatal error\u201d to assume that the UK vote was a specifically British issue, describing it as \u201ca desperate attempt to answer the questions that millions of Europeans ask themselves daily\u201d about security, cultural heritage and way of life.<br></p> <p>This view is found across EU institutions. \u201cBrexit is a symptom of broader issues,\u201d one EU diplomat said. \u201cIt is not as such the decisive factor, it is a wakeup call.\u201d</p> <p>Many Brussels insiders see little chance of repairing the bloc while France and Germany are preoccupied with elections in 2017. </p>",
  "<p>For as long as Alice, now 32, can remember, her father, \u201ca major drug dealer with freezers full of cocaine\u201d, was physically abusive towards her and her mother. \u201cMy first memory is of him backing us to the front door with a gun, saying he\u2019d kill her, kill me and kill himself one day.\u201d</p> <p>Alice\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/post-traumatic-stress-disorder\">post-traumatic stress disorder</a> (PTSD), a debilitating mental condition that can be caused by experiencing or witnessing a life-threatening event, went misdiagnosed for many years. The panic attacks, body shakes, nightmares and insomnia took their toll, while doctors treated her for depression and anxiety. There were many triggers: physical contact, being alone, showering, seeing someone who resembled a family member, loud sounds, even a red baseball cap \u2013 the kind her father wore. He and his friends also sexually abused her on numerous occasions. The disorder imprisoned Alice; she couldn\u2019t answer the phone or go to the shops on her own. \u201cI would get triggered by something and I\u2019d shake or shiver,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The MDMA just pulls things out of you. There were times when I just sat up and started talking</p> <footer> <cite>Alice, clinical trial patient</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Over the years, she tried talking therapy, somatic therapy, and <a href=\"http://www.emdr.com/what-is-emdr/\">eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing</a> (EMDR), in which a therapist moves his or her fingers left and right in front of a patient\u2019s face as they recount their trauma (the eye movements seem to dampen the memories). Nothing worked.</p> <p>Then, two and a half years ago, Alice enrolled in a clinical trial for a treatment combining psychotherapy with MDMA, near her home town of Erie, Colorado. She took 125mg of the drug, the same dose a clubber might take recreationally, three times over the course of 12 weeks. Her \u201ctrips\u201d were accompanied by eight-hour therapy sessions. \u201cI sat on a comfy couch and my therapist gave me a pill in a little handmade ceramic cup,\u201d she says. \u201cIt had a ritualistic feel to it. I was terrified the first time.\u201d Having taken the capsule, Alice was given an eye mask and headphones, and lay back listening to drum music until the drug, which she\u2019d never taken before, kicked in.</p> <p>\u201cThe MDMA just pulls things out of you,\u201d she says now. \u201cIt supports you. You can start looking at all your experiences and how they are affecting you. There were times when I just sat up and started talking. Or I\u2019d cry. Or there were moments of re-enactment. Physically, I felt like my whole body was vibrating for a while.\u201d</p> <p>During the session, her psychiatrist guided the conversation according to goals she had set with Alice beforehand. \u201cI had the first few minutes of peace I\u2019ve had in years,\u201d Alice says, though the sessions weren\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cSome parts were wonderful and others were kind of hellacious. I was super-sad and couldn\u2019t stop crying. It was not just an automatic love drug. But I was always able to come back to feeling good.\u201d</p> <p>Alice\u2019s recovery was astonishing. The gold-standard assessment tool for this kind of trauma is the clinician-administered PTSD scale, or Caps, which uses a lengthy questionnaire to determine the severity of a patient\u2019s symptoms (sample question: have there been times when you felt emotionally numb or had trouble experiencing feelings like love or happiness?). Any score over 60 is \u201csevere\u201d. Alice\u2019s score went from 106 to two. It\u2019s now at zero. In other words, her PTSD is gone.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Alice is one of 136 patients who have undergone MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in trials run by the not-for-profit <a href=\"http://www.maps.org/\">Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies</a> (Maps), based in Santa Cruz, California. Maps was founded in 1986 by <a href=\"http://www.maps.org/about/board\">Rick Doblin</a>, then a trainee therapist, and now an effervescent 62-year-old who has dedicated his life to studying the medical uses of psychedelic drugs, including psilocybin (magic mushrooms) and marijuana. \u201cIt\u2019s taken 30 years to get to this point,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve always known MDMA would work, but it\u2019s been really gratifying to see such tremendous results.\u201d He has studies nearing completion in Vancouver, Colorado, South Carolina and Israel, with plans for more in Australia.</p> <p>Doblin and his colleagues want to make the drug a prescription medicine. It is currently listed as a Schedule 1 substance by the US <a href=\"https://www.dea.gov/index.shtml\">Drug Enforcement Administration</a> (DEA) and a Class A drug by the Home Office in the UK, along with heroin, cocaine and LSD. So far, the Maps studies have been relatively small, but the results are encouraging. One South Carolina study involved 20 patients, mostly victims of sexual abuse, who had suffered from PTSD for more than 19 years. It was a placebo-controlled study, so all patients were given the same therapy, but only some were given the MDMA; 83% of those given the MDMA no longer met the criteria for PTSD following treatment, compared with 25% of those who were not given the drug. Best of all? The results have held for several years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e4cdc76bc26f2b323820b3df7ed0df6d2504c23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e4cdc76bc26f2b323820b3df7ed0df6d2504c23/0_279_4256_2553/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rick Doblin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rick Doblin, founder of Maps, has spent 30 years studying the medical uses of psychedelic drugs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gretchen Ertl</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the real test will be next year\u2019s phase three trials, the final stage of validation required if MDMA-assisted therapy is to be legalised. (Around 50% of all medical treatments fail at this stage.) A phase three trial requires bigger groups, at least 230 people, around the world. Once two trials are completed, and provided the results still look positive, the data can be submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (<a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/\">FDA</a>) and the <a href=\"http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/\">European Medicines Agency</a> for approval. In theory, MDMA could be legalised for therapeutic use by 2021.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>MDMA is not a silver bullet: treatment is heavily reliant on the accompanying therapy, and there is a lot of therapy: three monthly sessions with the drug, lasting eight hours each, punctuated by nine weekly 90-minute sessions without it.</p> <p>International guidelines recommend the first line of treatment for PTSD should be EMDR or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/08/cognitive-behavioural-therapy\">cognitive behavioural therapy</a>; but it can be very hard to treat. \u201cPerhaps 50% of people will have resistance,\u201d says Jonathan Bisson, professor in psychiatry at Cardiff University. \u201cWe need new treatments.\u201d</p> <p>Antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications are already big business for pharmaceutical companies. According to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18588361\">a 2008 US Veterans Association study</a>, about 80% of veterans diagnosed with PTSD are given psychiatric drugs. But <a href=\"http://time.com/3982440/ptsd-veterans/\">a 2015 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association</a> found that about two-thirds of veterans still meet the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis after treatment.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the US military continues to spend huge sums on drugs and disability payments. The Veterans Association says that, of the nearly 1.5 million former soldiers receiving compensation, 870,000 have PTSD, and their treatment costs the government as much as $17bn (\u00a312.7bn) a year. (In the UK, the Ministry of Defence pays \u00a3875m ($1.16bn) a year to those bereaved or injured through service; this figure covers mental and physical disability.) Doblin argues that if even a small portion of those funds were allocated to MDMA-assisted therapy, significant savings could be made. \u201cTo make MDMA into a medicine will cost around $30m,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it works, it could save hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars a year.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>MDMA use under medical supervision is a world away from someone necking a load of pills at a rave</p> <footer> <cite>Harry Shapiro, DrugWise</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If the FDA approves the drug, the DEA will have to decide whether to declassify it to Schedule 2, alongside morphine, opium and codeine \u2013 drugs that have a high potential for abuse but can be used under supervision. It is tempting to draw comparisons with the way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/17/pennsylvania-legalizes-medical-marijuana\">medical marijuana has been legalised in many US states</a>. If MDMA were to follow the same pattern, it wouldn\u2019t be long before any entrepreneurial drug user could cry trauma to gain access to a steady stream of highly potent ecstasy. But Doblin stresses this won\u2019t happen. \u201cThese drugs are fundamentally different: marijuana is the treatment itself; we\u2019re talking about MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.\u201d</p> <p>These different approaches reflect the level of risk associated with the drugs. No one dies from a marijuana overdose; <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsrelatedtodrugpoisoninginenglandandwales/2015-09-03\">50 people died after taking MDMA in the UK in 2014</a> alone. There is no figure for MDMA-related deaths in the US, but there has been <a href=\"http://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-12-ecstasy-teens.html\">a sharp rise in hospitalisations</a>, from around 4,500 people aged under 21 in 2005 to more than 10,000 in 2011, the latest data available.</p> <p>Used recreationally, MDMA is not without risk. \u201cIt mucks about with the body\u2019s thermostat and pushes up the body temperature, which can lead to organ failure and be fatal,\u201d explains Harry Shapiro, director of the UK charity DrugWise. \u201cBut its use under medical supervision is a world away from someone necking a load of pills at a rave.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>When James \u201cCJ\u201d Hardin, now 36, came back to the US from his tour of Iraq in 2006, he knew something was wrong. He was having nightmares and difficulty sleeping; loud sounds, crowds of people and flashes of light would send him into a state of anxiety. \u201cI\u2019d get tunnel vision and become hypervigilant, pulse racing and breath shallow.\u201d</p> <p>There were no flashbacks while he was awake, but he had nightmares about combat almost every night. He self-medicated with alcohol, combined with prescription sleeping pills and antidepressants. The Veterans Association offered CJ group therapy, but he found it a \u201cdick measuring contest\u201d, where participants engaged in one-upmanship over the atrocities they had experienced. When the sleeping pills became less effective, he also took the sedating antihistamine Benadryl, and drank rum until he passed out.</p> <p>After leaving the military in July 2010, CJ moved to North Carolina. \u201cI isolated myself and continued my bad habits, staying at home, drinking and smoking marijuana all day. Then I\u2019d wake up, eat and do it all again.\u201d A chance meeting with a Maps researcher led him to sign up for one of its studies \u2013 this one led by psychiatrist Michael Mithoefer and his wife Annie, a nurse, from their home and clinic in Charleston, South Carolina. The couple, now in their 60s, trained with the Czech psychedelic therapy pioneer <a href=\"http://www.stanislavgrof.com\">Stanislav Grof</a>, and have been working with MDMA since 2000.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"091a33c50f508cebd7a60040a8c06bdcfa79ce7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/091a33c50f508cebd7a60040a8c06bdcfa79ce7c/137_142_822_493/500.jpg\" alt=\"James \u201cCJ\u201d Hardin\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James \u2018CJ\u2019 Hardin was having nightmares and difficulty sleeping after his tour of Iraq.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James \u201cCJ\u201d Hardin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By that time, CJ was having frequent suicidal thoughts: \u201cI\u2019d resigned myself to believing my life wasn\u2019t going to change.\u201d But during his first session, once the drug had taken effect, he started to open up about his trauma. \u201cAll of a sudden I knew I was safe. I realised I\u2019d been treating my life like I was in Iraq the whole time, when I\u2019m not. I am back in the US. That left me immediately.\u201d</p> <p>He was able to talk about his fears of mortar attacks, and how he felt in a constant state of peril, as if he might die at any moment. \u201cI felt like there was no light at the end of the tunnel. After that first session, the light clicked on. It wasn\u2019t right in front of me, but it was there. I had hope.\u201d The MDMA alone wouldn\u2019t have worked, he says; it was the catalyst that made the therapy work. \u201cIt disarmed me, opened my mind and allowed me to feel at peace and safe as I talked about the things I did. After years thinking you\u2019re a horrible person and not safe, it\u2019s the biggest vacation.\u201d</p> <p>Like Alice, CJ had three sessions. And, like Alice, his Caps score plummeted: from 87 to just seven, falling to three the following year.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/18/topstories3.drugsandalcohol\">MDMA (full name 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) was first synthesised in 1912</a> by the German pharmaceutical company Merck, which had been looking for a substance to stop bleeding. It wasn\u2019t until the 1970s that its potential was explored more fully, when a California chemist called Alexander Shulgin started to experiment with cooking up psychoactive drugs. He made a batch of MDMA and started testing it on himself. In 1976, following a 120mg dose, he wrote, \u201cI feel absolutely clean inside, and there is nothing but pure euphoria. I have never felt so great or believed this to be possible \u2026 I am overcome by the profundity of the experience.\u201d</p> <p>Shulgin introduced the drug to California psychotherapist Leo Zeff, who had previously developed LSD therapies. Zeff was so impressed by MDMA, describing it as \u201cpenicillin for the soul\u201d, that he came out of retirement to introduce the drug to therapists across America and Europe. But just as its therapeutic potential was being explored, it started to make its way into the rave scene; in 1985, it was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/01/us/us-will-ban-ecstasy-a-hallucinogenic-drug.html\">banned by the DEA</a>.</p> <p>\u201cMDMA is highly volatile in one person but not the next,\u201d says DEA spokesman Melvin Patterson. \u201cYou and I could both take it, and I would have no reaction and your organs would start to shut down. There were tons of raves happening, and a lot of people being rushed to hospital and packed in ice to get their temperature back to normal. It was rare that people overdosed or died, but it did happen, and at such a frequency that we had to step in.\u201d</p> <p>The Mithoefers began researching MDMA-assisted therapy in 2000. \u201cIt seemed to make particular sense for PTSD,\u201d Michael says. \u201cMost of the treatments that have been effective involve revisiting the trauma in a therapeutic setting, but a lot of people are unwilling or unable because they get overwhelmed by anxiety. MDMA decreases fear and defensiveness, while increasing trust and empathy.\u201d He worked with Doblin to develop a plan for a clinical study, approved by the FDA in 2001.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df58137450757890b8b6478538e78bb0cfb720d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df58137450757890b8b6478538e78bb0cfb720d6/0_159_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Psychiatrist Michael Mithoefer and his wife Annie, a nurse\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Psychiatrist Michael Mithoefer and his wife Annie, a nurse, have been researching MDMA-assisted therapy for a decade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hunter McRae</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So far, all the Maps trials have used doses of MDMA from a 31-year-old batch with 99.8% purity made in a lab at Purdue University, Indiana. But for phase three trials, the drug needs something called <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/good-manufacturing-practice-and-good-distribution-practice\">good manufacturing practice</a> certification: Maps has to be able to show that, if MDMA were legalised, it could be produced on an industrial level at the same quality. This is where <a href=\"http://www.shasun.com\">the pharmaceutical company Shasun</a> comes in.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Shasun\u2019s factory is in the Northumberland village of Dudley, located a few miles south of Cramlington, a small town with the highest life expectancy in the UK. It is not a secret facility: taxi drivers know the plant without being given the address, which is on a main road opposite a row of red-brick semis and shops. But they may be surprised to learn that, inside, chemists are synthesising MDMA, perfectly legally.</p> <p>Security is high. Visitors must first report to the lodge inside the gates and in front of the red-and-white barrier, the kind more often seen at military bases. Mobile phones must be surrendered, along with laptops, pagers, cameras and electronic car key fobs. The confiscation has less to do with secrecy than with the fact that the equipment could ignite and cause an explosion \u2013 a huge safety risk on a site processing volatile chemicals.</p> <p>Shasun has been given a licence from the Home Office to manufacture Schedule 1 substances. About 20 of the company\u2019s 325 UK staff are involved in the production of 1kg of MDMA \u2013 worth close to \u00a3300,000 ($398,000). After that, it will be shipped to licensed distributors<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>in the US and Europe.</p> <p>British CEO Kevin Cook met Doblin two years ago in Boston, after being introduced by someone Cook describes as \u201ca friend in big pharma\u201d. He came away from the meeting reassured that Doblin knew what he was doing, and was doing it for a good cause; Shasun was prepared to jump through all the regulatory hoops to keep everyone on board.</p> <p>Getting the Home Office licence was not easy. The firm has had to comply with a very long list of health and safety regulations, and security procedures. The drugs they make, and their key ingredients, are now stored in an alarmed vault to which just a handful of staff have access, their movements monitored by CCTV. \u201cWe can handle products here where there is a high risk of diversion \u2013 products that can be used for recreational as well as medical benefit,\u201d says Cook, who has worked for Shasun for 27 years. Shasun\u2019s business development manager, Mike Hopkins, jumps in to stress: \u201cWe\u2019re not doing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/breaking-bad\">Breaking Bad</a> here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"345a2845d4d30e04cc54e5f13ece2bc0ab2c0c8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/345a2845d4d30e04cc54e5f13ece2bc0ab2c0c8d/0_90_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Cook, CEO of the British company manufacturing MDMA for medical use\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Cook, CEO of the British company manufacturing MDMA for medical use. \u2018We\u2019re not Breaking Bad here.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The MDMA lab is in Shasun\u2019s development centre, a prefab in a corner of the site. A rabbit hops around on the grass outside. \u201cOh, he\u2019s fine, don\u2019t mind him,\u201d Cook says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any chemicals out here he needs to worry about.\u201d To access the building, visitors must wear white lab coats and protective goggles. Making the MDMA is much like following a recipe \u2013 one that was acquired from a German firm and emailed to Shasun\u2019s chemists as an attachment. \u201cAdd X of this, stir to Y, heat to Z. It\u2019s like cooking, but to get a really good-quality end product, you have to experiment a lot,\u201d Cook explains. Robert Smith, a chemist with a degree from Cambridge and a PhD from Manchester, demonstrates the equipment his small team uses to synthesise the drug. Unlicensed manufacturers would face many years in jail, but making MDMA does not give Smith any kind of illicit thrill. \u201cWe just treat it like any other project.\u201d He shrugs.</p> <p>Recruiting a team was not difficult, Hopkins says; no one cited ethical concerns. \u201cWe always try to inspire our teams to understand what they are making and why. In this case, they are working for a non-profit trying to help people with severe PTSD. They find that sort of thing very motivating.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>After fundraising, Maps\u2019 second biggest challenge is training therapists, who must undergo the same treatment as their patients, to understand how it works. In November last year, Ben Sessa, a British psychiatrist based in Bristol, travelled to South Carolina for a 10-day stay with the Mithoefers, during which he underwent his own MDMA-assisted therapy session. \u201cI haven\u2019t got any psychological trauma,\u201d he says. \u201cI had a lovely upbringing, stable family. But it\u2019s really important to learn this mental state in order to guide my patients through it.\u201d</p> <p>On the day of his session, all of it captured on video, Sessa takes his first dose of MDMA just before 11am, washed down with a swig of Gatorade. It\u2019s a double blind study, so he doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s a placebo. He hopes it isn\u2019t. (\u201cI chose the red pill and not the blue pill,\u201d he says, referencing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE7PKRjrid4\">The Matrix</a>.) Dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, Sessa reclines on a bed with Michael in a chair facing him, to his right, and Annie to his left. Propped into a seated position by a fortress of pillows and a large red and gold cushion, he has a blood pressure monitor wrapped around his left arm while the Mithoefers\u2019 small white dog, Flynn, snuggles next to his leg.</p> <p>The conversation is led by Sessa, with occasional prompts from the Mithoefers. Music plays in the background, starting with a gentle piano piece and building to higher tempo as the drug kicks in. The Mithoefers tell him to lie back, close his eyes and \u201cgo inside\u201d. Annie regularly checks in on him, offering sips of juice, extra blankets and words of encouragement.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is not a panacea. We need a cautious, methodological approach with sound scientific evidence</p> <footer> <cite>Ben Sessa, psychiatrist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Around two hours into the session, Sessa takes a supplementary dose. Even though he\u2019s in a darkened room, he asks for his red-rimmed sunglasses. \u201cThat second dose really hit the spot, man,\u201d he tells the Mithoefers. He breathes heavily and purposefully, nodding his head to the music with his eyes closed, his lower jaw shifting subtly from left to right. Clearly, he did not take the placebo.</p> <p>Sessa had taken MDMA in a rave context in the past but tells me: \u201cThis was very different from taking ecstasy recreationally. Imagine taking all that external energy that keeps you pumping all night on the dance floor and turning it inwards.\u201d</p> <p>Much of his session is spent lying down with an eye mask and headphones on; at times he hums and moans or reaches out to hold one of the Mithoefers\u2019 hands. \u201cI felt very safe and secure, but when I went to the toilet in the harsh light and stood looking at myself in the mirror, that\u2019s when it felt like raving. I was completely fucked. I wanted to rush back into the bed and get under the covers and go back inside.\u201d</p> <p>At other times, he is encouraged to sit up and talk \u2013 about personal issues, psychotherapy, his constant need to be busy. \u201cLife\u2019s too short,\u201d he tells the Mithoefers. \u201cAll these trinkets we adorn ourselves with are meaningless. It\u2019s time that\u2019s the only gift. So I don\u2019t like to waste time.\u201d</p> <p>By around 4pm, the effects of the drug are wearing off, though Sessa says he experienced no comedown. He thinks ravers\u2019 comedowns are mostly hangovers. \u201cMost people who take ecstasy will go to the pub, drink three pints, then go to a club and stay up until five, take coke, drink more wine and beer, then get some soup and sleep on Sunday. Of course they feel bad on Monday!\u201d</p> <p>Three days later, Sessa had a second session. It was the same setup, but this time without the drug. \u201cIt was incredibly cathartic,\u201d he says. \u201cI was in floods of tears at times and talking about all sorts of issues. It was as if the MDMA had unlocked them three days earlier. It\u2019s not just the drug sessions themselves where the work takes place \u2013 the real work is how the material that\u2019s unlocked is then processed in the non-drug sessions.\u201d</p> <p>Sessa, who has worked with many children and adolescents battling trauma and addictions, believes MDMA could be an incredibly powerful tool for his patients. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any medicines that allow patients and their therapists to approach trauma. Antidepressants only treat the symptoms, so this could be a very important step forward.\u201d</p> <p>Trauma is incredibly hard to treat, he says. \u201cYou sit in a room with a stranger and ask them to tell you about their child abuse and expect them to do it. They don\u2019t. They can\u2019t. So their mental health problem becomes a chronic disorder. In 20 years\u2019 time, people may say: \u2018Do you remember when we used to do psychotherapy without psychedelics?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"23c3d2abedd25bff4baf48257454b945040c540a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23c3d2abedd25bff4baf48257454b945040c540a/0_1075_3744_2245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pill\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MDMA could be legalised for therapeutic use by 2021. \u2018Imagine taking all that external energy that keeps you pumping all night on the dance floor and turning it inwards.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Tilley/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite his enthusiasm, Sessa remains pragmatic and is put off by some of the more evangelical factions in the pro-psychedelic movement, as well as its strong links with anti-establishment hippy culture; for him, this detracts from the science. \u201cSome people want to live in a chemical utopia. This is not a panacea. We need a cautious, methodological approach with sound scientific evidence.\u201d</p> <p>Sessa has brought what he\u2019s learned back to the UK, where he is hoping to start two Maps-funded MDMA studies in 2017; for now, he says, he\u2019s in a \u201cfragile period of getting ethical approval\u201d.</p> <p>One of these studies is in Cardiff and will involve giving patients either MDMA or a placebo and putting them in an MRI scanner, where they will be subjected to a narrative script of their trauma to see what happens in their brain. The second study, in Bristol, will treat patients with alcohol dependency, post-detox. \u201cWe\u2019ll put them through a course of MDMA psychotherapy and look at the rates of recovery. The link between trauma and addiction is unambiguous,\u201d Sessa says.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>In anticipation of the drug\u2019s legalisation, Maps has set up a benefit corporation, a socially responsible company that, unlike Maps, is allowed to manage prescription sales of a medicine. All profits from the MDMA developed by Shasun will be funnelled back into Maps\u2019 research. The patent for MDMA has long expired but, thanks to a law signed by Ronald Reagan in 1984, no other pharmaceutical company would be able to use Maps\u2019 research data for five years after the drug is approved.</p> <p>Big pharma probably wouldn\u2019t be interested anyway, Doblin says, because the therapy involves so few doses of MDMA. \u201cMost pharmaceutical companies want to make a drug people take on a daily basis, that treats symptoms, not the problem, so when you stop taking it, the problem comes back. It\u2019s a money-making formula. We are the opposite of that: you take the drug a few times, hopefully it cures you and you go on your way.\u201d</p> <p>For Alice and CJ, legalisation can\u2019t come soon enough. Alice says the biggest change since treatment has been her relationship with her husband and two young children. \u201cIt allowed me to connect \u2013 I could step into now, instead of living back then.\u201d For the first time, she was able to hug her husband, whom she married 11 years ago, when she was 21, and to undress in front of him. \u201cI could hold on to my children\u2019s hands and snuggle them without feeling gross.\u201d She is now working as an optician and training to become a psychotherapist herself.</p> <p>For CJ, the treatment led to a \u201c100% turnaround\u201d in his life. Like Alice, he no longer has therapy or takes medication for his mental health. He has given up drinking and found a job with an aviation company. He married his long-term girlfriend at the end of August. He still thinks about his time in the army, but now remembers the good things, the people he bonded with. He wishes other people could experience the benefits: \u201cIt feels as though there\u2019s a cure for cancer that I know of \u2013 and it\u2019s not being used.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Alice is a pseudonym.

  "<p>As Bill, Chris and Jim took the podium on Tuesday to announce the Turnbull government\u2019s decision to scrap the baby bonus, preserve the clean energy supplement, and wipe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/12/scott-morrison-signals-willingness-to-compromise-on-6bn-budget-savings-bill\">$6.3bn off the deficit</a>, it seemed as if Bizarro Malcolm, Bizarro Scott and Bizarro Mathias had turned up to run the country.</p> <p>Sometimes it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling Australia is living in a Seinfeld episode.</p> <p>After all, we did just experience an election campaign about nothing at all. Also, the campaign ran for eight weeks, making it seem as interminably long as Seinfeld\u2019s final episode.</p> <p>Is it possible Malcolm Turnbull is just a great big Seinfeld fan, and he\u2019s enacting all his favourite moments while in office?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/03/seinfeld-modern-tv-seinfeldia-jennifer-keishin-armstrong\">Seinfeld: the show that invented modern television is still 'shockingly relevant'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not a crazy theory. Consider that on the one-year anniversary of his prime ministership, notable Coalition figures such as Jeff Kennett, Peta Credlin and deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce struggled to identify a raison d\u2019\u00eatre for the Turnbull government. My Seinfeldian theory of Turnbull\u2019s governing can\u2019t be dismissed out of hand.</p> <p>Dear readers, I do confess: I feel that, as a former premier, I should use a more substantial tool for political analysis than American sitcoms. </p> <p>Then again, I\u2019m not the one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/23/malcolm-turnbulls-continuity-and-change-slogan-straight-out-of-veep\">who borrowed Jerry\u2019s friend Elaine\u2019s campaign slogan</a> to describe the Coalition government. </p> <p>More proof. </p> <p>But as the parliamentary week wore on, I started to wonder if I\u2019d gotten the TV analogy all wrong. Maybe the current state of the Australian government wasn\u2019t so much Seinfeld as Bewitched. Remember when, after four seasons, the show casually brought in a new actor to play the part of Darrin, as if its audience wouldn\u2019t notice?</p> <p>For example, this week the part of Tony Abbott was played by Turnbull. Turnbull really threw his all into the role of \u201cAustralia\u2019s most inept prime minister\u201d by trying his best to match Abbott\u2019s Newspoll net satisfaction ratings. He also wasted a lot of political capital by introducing legislation to run Abbott\u2019s plebiscite on same-sex marriage \u2013 the very process that Turnbull had decried just 13 months ago. </p> <p>The part of Turnbull was played by Bill Shorten. Not only did Shorten announce Coalition government policy but he also took a Dixer in question time and junked the last two days of parliament so he could meet the Canadian prime minister. </p> <p>(By the way, I think I speak for a large portion of Australia \u2013 men and women alike \u2013 when I say I understand Shorten\u2019s decision. Given a choice of looking across the chamber at the Coalition frontbench, or across the table at Justin Trudeau, I know where I\u2019d rather be.)</p> <p>The part of the responsible and grown-up treasurer of Australia was played by Scott Morrison. He negotiated in good faith with the opposition to pass the omnibus savings legislation. He also resolved the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/superannuation-backflip-on-500000-cap-wins-over-coalition-conservatives\">superannuation debate</a> that had been paralysing his government. I don\u2019t know where the Coalition found this guy, but he\u2019s a vast improvement on their usual treasurer. </p> <p>And the part of Shorten was played by Tanya Plibersek. In Shorten\u2019s absence she led the opposition in question time in what I judged to be an admirable effort. </p> <p>For a brief moment it looked like Peter Dutton would be playing the part of the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz (you know, he\u2019d discover that he really did have a heart all along). An ambiguous interview <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/peter-dutton-open-to-refugees-on-nauru-being-resettled-in-new-zealand\">Dutton gave on al-Jazeera</a> led to speculation on Thursday afternoon that the Australian government was about to announce that refugees on Manus Island and Nauru could go to New Zealand.

If a large fraction of water use goes to feed industry or a particular crop like sugarcane with state subsidies, say, is it still important to focus on reducing individual household water use?

Pulses and beans etc are a really inexpensive way to get protein. Nuts and seeds on the other hand can be quite pricey. Remember that the world's poorest people are on the whole pretty close to being vegan most of the time. However, there is also a cultural veganism that can look and sound elitist. That is a perception vegans should counter, in the hope of making this choice more widely acceptable.</p> <p>On the issue of soya, paradoxically, if you want to eat less of it, you should eat soya. The reason is that the great majority of soya is fed to livestock, in order to produce milk, eggs and meat. And that production process is highly inefficient by comparison to eating it yourself. If you eat it directly, you can choose soya products that are grown without rainforest destruction and other such impacts. That's much harder if you are eating it indirectly, through animal products.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-16T10:03:30.294Z\">at 11.03am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57dbc274e4b067ad3008850e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/georgemonbiot\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-16T10:00:12.742Z\">11.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/sep/16/george-monbiot-qa-post-your-questions#comment-83369843\">greenwichite</a> asks:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Do you think journalists need to change their mindset, given their tendency to evaluate governments almost exclusively on their delivery of \u201cGDP growth\u201d, regardless of the environmental impact? <br></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/sep/16/george-monbiot-qa-post-your-questions#comment-83374121\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1395989\" title=\"View GeorgeMonbiot\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/1395989\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for GeorgeMonbiot\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1395989\" title=\"View GeorgeMonbiot\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">GeorgeMonbiot</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/83374121\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">16 September 2016 10:50am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>I think this is a big issue.

We have recently built a small extension ( less impact than moving) we have improved insulation to house.</p> <p>We consider ourselves normal doing what we can do. In reality we are a tiny drop as a family even if we lived off grid zero emissions type lifestyle it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. We can only tackle it as a nation, as a world United. Our politics is not fit for purpose to tackle climate change. <br></p> <p>What are the best things we can do, to deliver politics that can combat climate change?</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/sep/16/george-monbiot-qa-post-your-questions#comment-83372324\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1395989\" title=\"View GeorgeMonbiot\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/1395989\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for GeorgeMonbiot\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1395989\" title=\"View GeorgeMonbiot\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">GeorgeMonbiot</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/83372324\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">16 September 2016 10:27am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>The simplest solution to almost all environmental problems is government intervention. But as a result of neoliberal ideology and regulatory capture (the first in service to the second) the self-hating state refuses to intervene on a wide range of issues where it could quickly make a difference. So we're left with the far weaker leverage of consumerism: changes in diets, habits, buying patterns etc. it's not enough, but on many issues it's about all we have. Of course we have to be political as well, and do everything we can to precipitate wider change, but on issue after issue, the state is not your friend.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57dbbc9de4b0e813b694d962\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/georgemonbiot\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-16T09:35:24.047Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/sep/16/george-monbiot-qa-post-your-questions#comment-83371851\">Rams65</a> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I vote Green as they offer the most positive policies to me.

But I kept going, because I knew that if I stopped studying, I wouldn\u2019t have anything.</p> <p>My home village was destroyed so when I graduated I made the dangerous journey to Turkey with my brother to continue my studies.

I wasn\u2019t a hellish student, but I was struggling and when a teacher told me I\u2019d fail, I left. I fell into a bad crowd and the negative aspects of my personality, like my temper, impressed them and I played up to it.</p> <p>Once you\u2019ve reached a point of no return, it\u2019s like pushing a boulder down a hill \u2013 it gathers momentum and won\u2019t stop. My mother died and a few years after that I ended up behind bars for possession of crack cocaine.<br></p> <p>The one thing <a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Shawshank-Redemption,-The.html\">the Shawshank Redemption</a> gets absolutely right is that the first night in prison is the hardest and the walls really do wail. Prison is terrifying, it\u2019s a place of paranoia and fear and you can\u2019t show emotion, but everyone breaks down at some point.<br></p> <p>I wanted to end my life a few times, but education gave me a second chance. I hadn\u2019t read a book before, but I did my GCSEs in prison. I\u2019d help other prisoners by reading letters for them, or with sums in the canteen. I was on a voyage of self discovery. I saw I had potential and just hadn\u2019t realised it.</p> <p>After I was released, I achieved a first-class degree in youth work from Middlesex University, followed by a master\u2019s in youth crime and criminology, while working at <a href=\"http://www.stgilestrust.org.uk/\">St Giles Trust</a>.

It just wasn\u2019t the sort of thing a Brummie, working-class girl was meant to do. After some years I realised the nunnery wasn\u2019t right for me, but with no family to go back to I became homeless when I left.</p> <p>I spent the next few years living in fields. I got a cushion cover and a piece of curtain out of a dustbin for clothes. I lived off food from litter bins. The worst thing was trying to keep clean, which you can\u2019t really do. I hitchhiked and spent time living in a squat in London with heroin addicts, where I tried my best to help people. Once I was woken up by someone holding a knife to my throat.</p> <p>Eventually I got a room in an attic and worked as a carer for an older lady, before finally becoming a piano teacher. In my late sixties, I thought it was now or never. I had talents I hadn\u2019t used, so I studied a music degree and a master\u2019s to improve my piano lessons.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to study a master\u2019s at 69, because I often get exhausted. But music has always had great importance in my life.

I later worked as a nurse because I wanted to help people.

  "<p>Following Paddy Ashdown up the stairs of his Kennington home (I tell him: \u201cI love your house\u201d \u2013 because that\u2019s what I do when I go to people\u2019s houses \u2013 and he returns smartly: \u201cIt\u2019s a flat\u201d), I mistake his publisher for his co-author, Sylvie Young. \u201cShe\u2019s not my co-author.\u201d \u201cSorry, researcher?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s my collaborator.\u201d I say he should shave her head for the book launch. He gives me a look that says, \u201cNow, why would I shave a person\u2019s head?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s quite easy to make a mistake with Lord Ashdown, but he is also a very equable, forgiving man. \u201cI just regard myself as being an exceptionally fortunate person,\u201d he says at one point. \u201cI\u2019ve had the opportunity to have adventures in circumstances that are no longer possible. Britain was just coming out of empire. But I\u2019m also able to live the life that I live now.\u201d It has by any lights been fulfilling: a military career, leadership of the Lib Dems, on to the House of Lords, smattered with the memoirs and books that he writes, he says, \u201cin the corners of my life, on trains, waiting for planes\u201d.</p> <p>His latest, Game of Spies, is the true story of a fascinating wartime triad: a spy, a traitor and a disarmingly human member of the Gestapo. It is an insistent and sometimes mesmerising read, tugging at your attention when you put it down, based on an extraordinary cache of documents sent to him by a reader of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/23/paddy-ashdown-spoils-afternoon-prime-minister\">a previous book of his, A Brilliant Little Operation</a>. However, despite this proposed subject matter, most exchanges either begin or end \u2013 or both \u2013 with Brexit, an event about which he felt, \u201clike everybody else, bereft; a sense of personal bereavement. I knew this was coming, a month before. You entertain hopes at the last moment, it\u2019s always a shock. But we drove back to London over Salisbury Plain, it was one of those lovely June mornings. I turned to [his wife] Jane and I think there were probably tears in my eyes, and said, \u2018It\u2019s not our country any more.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>So begins the prologue of his book, in which he writes that it seems to him \u201cextraordinary that our besieged little country committed so many of its young men and women and so much of its resources to secret and extremely hazardous operations to free the countries of Europe, which we have now chosen not to be part of\u201d. So return his thoughts, to the fact that he is \u201cvery, very, very frightened about where we are. There is something really nasty here: I remember saying about three years ago, there is a monster below the placid surface of British politics, and it has bloody well emerged.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"593d6f55eaf0d14dbcf3a5c9f192d4c82ae73767\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/593d6f55eaf0d14dbcf3a5c9f192d4c82ae73767/0_229_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashdown, centre, with David Cameron and former Labour party leader Neil Kinnock, make campaign calls during the EU referendum campaign.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashdown, centre, with David Cameron and former Labour party leader Neil Kinnock, make campaign calls during the EU referendum campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are times when his misery could not be more trenchant: \u201cLeave aside the fact \u2013 which is good \u2013 that we don\u2019t have mad militarists who want to go to war, everything else about our age reminds me of the 1930s. The fracture, the disrespect for the business of government, the hatred of the establishment. You see a retreat into isolationism, you see the rise of ugly forces, you see those who lie and make a pattern of lying ... As Goebbels said, if you\u2019re going to tell a lie, tell a big one and tell it often. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/brexit-camp-abandons-350-million-pound-nhs-pledge\">It\u2019s hard not to think of the [\u00a3350m for the NHS] bus</a>. I\u2019m not calling Boris Johnson Goebbels.\u201d Well, except you are. He shakes his head sadly \u2013 hyperbole would diminish the seriousness of the situation: \u201cRespect for our country has fallen so much,\u201d he modifies, \u201cand putting Boris Johnson in that position is not best calculated to improve that.\u201d<br></p> <p>He isn\u2019t the only person to liken political movements across Europe today to the rise of fascism in the interwar years \u2013 sociologists do it all the time, and Andrew Marr said something similar last weekend in the Sunday Times \u2013 but Ashdown might be the greatest vexation to the leave side. Especially on Twitter, he pulls no punches (arguably, it is not possible to pull a punch on Twitter), <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paddyashdown/status/772678098345160704\">likening the Tory Brexiteers to brownshirts last week</a>, which caused <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3778989/Why-Paddy-Ashdown-clown-s-wrong-QUENTIN-LETTS.html\">the Daily Mail to call him a \u201cclown who\u2019s wrong about everything\u201d</a>. He waves off this sort of stuff: \u201cI don\u2019t believe you should ever allow yourself to be frightened into timidity for using a metaphor. I\u2019m a writer, I\u2019m not going to be frightened off a metaphor.\u201d He pronounces it \u201cmetafer\u201d, like the name of a gun or a private. He still sounds incredibly military, and says that it informs his writing. \u201cHave I been involved in the business of intelligence, one way or another? Yes. Have I been in the special forces? Yes. Have I been in politics? Yes. That gives you certain insights, much as a woman\u201d \u2013 a look of discomfort crosses his face, which I must admit I enjoy \u2013 \u201cbecause she\u2019s a woman, could write a piece, and know what a woman\u2019s view of these events would be. I don\u2019t say men can\u2019t do it, but you\u2019re better equipped.\u201d Cheers, dude.</p> <p>However, he insists that the military is the least interesting thing about his past. \u201cIt\u2019s the bit where people love to pigeonhole me \u2013 \u2018He was in the Royal Marines and the special services.\u2019 Let me ask you this one question: did you know that I\u2019m the only member of parliament elected from the unemployed register? Well, I was.\u201d In 1983, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/paddy-ashdown-speaks-of-his-life-on-the-dole-1150327.html\">he was on a community programme for the long-term unemployed</a>, working voluntarily as a youth worker, having applied unsuccessfully for 150 jobs. Five years later, he was leader of the Lib Dems. He is not without pride, but he\u2019s generally proud about the right things.</p> <p>That said, he has a bit of a blindspot about the Lib Dems, against whom he will not hear a word. Nick Clegg is \u201ca vastly underappreciated figure in British politics\u201d, he says, although doesn\u2019t deny calling him <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/03/nick-clegg-did-not-cater-tories-brazen-ruthlessness\">\u201cfat, pale and unhealthy\u201d, as Clegg recalled in his recent memoirs</a>. \u201cYeah, absolutely. He was the person at the front of the campaign. We get on very well together, I like him very much, but I wasn\u2019t about to not tell him something that I felt he ought to know.\u201d He thinks the Lib Dem \u201cresurgence is happening, take a look at the byelection results\u201d and that the party will, long-term, see a \u201cdividend\u201d from having been in the coalition: \u201cWe will have a reputation for being able to bear the burdens of government, I never expected that in the short run.\u201d And finally \u2013 this is the bit that makes me boggle: \u201cI think history will judge it [2010 to 2015] one of the best periods of government we\u2019ve had in my lifetime, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see another as good for some considerable time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7efab327649947c3e762bd53fe748704deffe178\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7efab327649947c3e762bd53fe748704deffe178/0_0_4256_2833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Charles Kennedy, centre, and Nick Clegg in 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Charles Kennedy, centre, and Nick Clegg in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seriously? \u201cI think it did a number of things that were really important.\u201d Like what? \u201cFirst of all, it restrained the Tories; secondly, it helped the country through a very, very difficult passage by providing a majority government who took some sensible decisions.\u201d Like what? \u201cThirdly, it was serious about its environmental targets. Most people say that the green deal did a huge amount. Speak to environmentalists.\u201d (I did so at the time, as luck would have it: the deal started off with some ambition, but ended up as a programme of market-driven loans \u2013 at 7%, not even that cheap \u2013 for people to insulate their homes. A poor household couldn\u2019t afford one, and a richer household would get a much better rate sticking it on their mortgage. Three years into the scheme, only 2,000-3,000 households had taken it up. I don\u2019t want to bore on, but in the interests of a pre-post-truth politics, I feel bound to point out that this was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jan/18/green-deal-green-disaster\">one of the limpest, most pathetic policies in the history of government.</a>)</p> <p>\u201cFourthly, did we do everything to close the gap between the rich and the poor? No, but we did some very important things, such as the pupil premium. It was good, sensible, solid government. It didn\u2019t do all the things I would have wanted, but I\u2019m very clear that it was the right thing to do for the country.\u201d His loyalty to the party is absolutely unswerving, but he will, finally, admit: \u201cDo I want to see them recover? Yes. Will I help them recover? Yes. Do I see signs of recovery? Yes. But that isn\u2019t going to be in time to help the people I want to help.\u201d</p> <p>This is the thinking behind <a href=\"http://www.moreunited.uk\">More United, a joint venture with others broadly of his mind</a> such as Martha Lane Fox \u2013 which attempts to connect people to politics by some route other than a party. \u201cIt has 35,000 members in five weeks, which is not bad, half the size of the Lib Dems.\u201d It has five very broad principles \u2013 fair markets, rebooted democracy, a green economy, openness and tolerance, pro-immigration \u2013 and its members campaign, with money and by any other means they can think of, to give support to the candidate they think best embodies the ideas. It\u2019s neutral in a party political sense, anyone can join, has <a href=\"https://www.crowdpac.co.uk\">a lot in common with Steve Hilton\u2019s Crowdpac</a> and relies ultimately on open primaries, in which non-affiliated voters can choose a candidate.</p> <p>There are politicians who remain profoundly opposed to this idea, most of them in the Labour party, and whose furthest concession to a possible progressive alliance is that the Greens, the Lib Dems and Labour might cut some electoral deals between constituencies. \u201cBeen there, done that,\u201d says Ashdown. \u201cIt turns friends into enemies, it exhausts and uses up vast amounts of political capital. And by the way, politicians aren\u2019t even believed. If the centre-left says, \u2018Do this\u2019, the people will say, \u2018Fuck off\u2019.\u201d He thinks, and he\u2019s by no means alone in this, that political parties have come unshackled from the movements that gave them legitimacy and energy. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a public that doesn\u2019t feel represented by the political parties, they will react. So they either take over, Trump or Corbyn, a political party, move in and occupy it. Or they form their own political parties, Ukip is an example, Marine Le Pen, the Greens in a way.\u201d</p> <p>The question he\u2019s trying to answer now is: \u201cWhy do movements always have to be for horrible things?\u201d and, on the heels of that, how to organise those on the left \u2013 environmentalists, liberals, \u201csensible Labour\u201d, in his winning phrase. \u201cIn the past, if you wanted to get the left together you had to accept the single dominant polarity, which was Labour. Especially with Blair, it meant doing that kind of deal, top-down by the way. Now the left is so fractured, so broken, so diverse, so pluralist. How do you assemble the pieces to make an effective centre-left political force possible?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63f7f9a869cde095e07f4408baec5cda550f3481\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63f7f9a869cde095e07f4408baec5cda550f3481/0_0_3687_2489/1000.jpg\" alt=\"By the Bell suspension bridge in Glasgow in 1995.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">By the Bell suspension bridge in Glasgow in 1995.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although he had never entertained the idea of retiring, it seems as though he did think his days in the political fray were over. Having written two volumes of memoirs at the start of the century, he gave up the discipline of keeping a diary. \u201cI should have kept one during the referendum. I didn\u2019t expect to find myself doing anything interesting.\u201d His sadness over the result is tinged, like all great regrets, with self-criticism. \u201cIt\u2019s not generally known, but about four weeks before the referendum debate, I was so worried that we were going to lose, I went to see John Major, I went to see Gordon Brown, I went to see George Robertson. Major was really impressive and Gordon did his Gordon best, but that wasn\u2019t the issue. The strategy was wrong. I said: \u2018Listen, the only way that we\u2019re going to win this is if the heavyweights get together and tell them that they\u2019re going to lose. Each of us played our individual parts, but we didn\u2019t get together to turn the campaign.\u201d</p> <p>It is perhaps in this glimpse of his sense of failure that you recognise his great success. Disappointment cannot wither him \u2013 not his party\u2019s first bite of government turning sour, not its minuscule remains, not the end of British internationalism, not the slog of rebuilding tolerance and generosity as political ideals, not the fact that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/oct/21/uk.politicalnews\">his foes on social media still call him Paddy Pantsdown</a>. His resilience is all the more impressive for the fact that he doesn\u2019t so much swing between as simultaneously occupy positions of intense pessimism and wild optimism. One minute <a href=\"http://www.potw.org/archive/potw351.html\">he\u2019s quoting Yeats\u2019s The Second Coming </a>as a current-affairs commentary (\u201cThe blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere / The ceremony of innocence is drowned; / The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity\u201d, and I must admit, the last line brings an unbidden and wholly unwelcome image of James Delingpole flashing before my eyes).

  "<p>World leaders are guilty of a \u201cshocking failure of leadership\u201d over the global refugee crisis, <a href=\"http://www.international-uk.org/charities/amnesty-international-uk/?gclid=CJniwe_3kM8CFRYTGwodaHoOig\">Amnesty International</a> has said, in advance of a march across London on Saturday expected to be attended by thousands of people.<br></p> <p>Before the <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/actions/join-refugees-welcome-march-demo-protest-2016\">Refugees Welcome march</a>, some have told their stories to the Guardian, including a young man who describes his journey from Afghanistan to the UK as more torturous than seeing his family and friends murdered at home, and a woman sentenced to 74 lashes and 91 days in prison in Iran for protesting at the death sentence given to a spiritual leader.</p> <p>The march will take place two days before the <a href=\"http://refugeesmigrants.un.org/summit\">UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants</a>, after which Barack Obama will host <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/p/io/c71574.htm\">a meeting</a> to appeal to leaders to agree to specific commitments on helping refugees.<br></p> <p>But Kate Allen, the director of Amnesty International UK, said that instead of being ready to announce steps to end the crisis, \u201cworld leaders have been engaged in a race to the bottom, prioritising narrow self-interest over the rights of some of the most vulnerable people on the planet and trying to outdo each other in hostility and obstruction\u201d.</p> <p>The day before Obama\u2019s meeting, the prime minister, Theresa May, will join leaders of UN member states in New York, where they are expected to adopt an agreement on responding to the global refugee crisis. </p> <p>The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, had put forward <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/09/world-leaders-have-shirked-responsibility-on-refugee-crisis/\">proposals</a> on sharing responsibility, but in discussions before the summit, the EU and governments including Russia and China removed the requirement to take in specific numbers of people. This, said Allen, \u201crenders it toothless\u201d.</p> <p> There are <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/uk/figures-at-a-glance.html\">21 million refugees in the world today</a>, according to <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/uk/\">the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR)</a>, of whom only 14% live in developed countries.

With few possessions and just the clothes he stood up in, he wasn\u2019t sure exactly what had happened to him. \u201cThe way we were trafficked, we didn\u2019t see much,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Zazai had no choice but to leave his home in Kabul. \u201cOur neighbours were murdered, my family home was bombed and my beautiful city was reduced to rubble when the mujahideen came in 1979. The firing was indiscriminate and my family had no choice but to escape to Jalalabad. </p> <p>\u201cThe journey was terrifying. Civil war has a domino effect. When you start dividing people over religion, the next step is to pick on those from a different tribe or who speak differently. On our journey out of Kabul, with bullets chaotically fired from outside, passing through our car, we were stopped at least 10 times and questioned. Each one of those times, a small mistake could have led to us all being killed. It was a nightmare. </p> <p>\u201cWhen we arrived in Jalalabad, we lived in a tent in a refugee camp. There were 15 of us. There was no water, sanitation and almost no food. It was appalling, but the situation has got worse since then. There are now 1.2 million people internally displaced in Afghanistan. </p> <p>\u201cBut even under such dreadful conditions, we didn\u2019t want to leave our country. We wanted to return to Kabul, but the violence there just kept getting worse. Then in 2001, after the September 11 attacks, the Americans attacked and the Taliban began forcing all the young men to fight. </p> <p>\u201cMy family risked everything to smuggle me to Pakistan but even there, I risked being sent back so I flew to a central Asian country, possibly Uzbekistan \u2013 I\u2019m not sure \u2013 then walked and hid in cars and lorries, for 12 months to get to Belgium, where I was smuggled into Dover. </p> <p>\u201cThe whole journey was horrendous. The traffickers gave us drugs to keep us quiet. When children cried, their parents were beaten as punishment, and we were often left by the smugglers, hiding in boarded up houses, for weeks at a time.</p> <p>\u201cI had thought the conflict in Afghanistan was bad, but the escape from it was absolutely terrible. Then once I arrived in the UK, the treatment by the Home Office was torturous all over again, the disbelief, the stigmatising, the waiting.\u201d</p> <p>After he arrived in the UK, Zazai was sent to Coventry. He studied for a degree and in 2008 was given British citizenship. Now director of the city\u2019s<a href=\"http://covrefugee.org/\"> Refugee and Migrant centre</a>, he is also a key player in <a href=\"https://coventry.cityofsanctuary.org/\">City of Sanctuary</a>, a nationwide support network for refugees. </p> <p> \u201cThe march is important because we need to put a human face on the refugee crisis,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople need to understand that refugees are just like them, that anyone living in torment and violence will strive to get their family and children to safety.\u201d</p> <h2>Sara\u2019s story</h2> <p>The student of a spiritual leader in Iran who was imprisoned for his beliefs, Sara Saei, was arrested in 2015 during protests for his release. She was sent to <a href=\"https://adibmasumian.com/gharchak-prison/\">Gharchak prison</a>, where she was held alongside murderers and other dangerous prisoners. </p> <p> In February this year, she was found guilty of disrupting public order and <a href=\"https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2016/01/sara-saei/\">sentenced to 74 lashes and 91 days\u2019 imprisonment</a>. \u201cI was terrified. If you go into prison in Iran, you don\u2019t necessarily come out alive,\u201d she says. \u201cI fled to the UK. I arrived illegally without a passport. It was very stressful, especially in Turkey where the government cooperates with Iran. It took one and a half months before I landed at Gatwick and could claim asylum.\u201d</p> <p> While Saei applies for refugee status, she volunteers at Amnesty and studies for her maths and English GCSEs. She shares an eight-bedroom flat with 10 people in east London. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard not being allowed to work,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to do a masters at university and contribute to this country. </p> <p>\u201cThis is a wonderful country. I\u2019m still amazed by how freely people can express their religion and opinions.

Gurning\u2019s most famous event is its world championship, which takes place at the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.egremontcrabfair.com/index.html\">Egremont Crab Fair in Cumbria</a>. Though the sport is probably not as old as the event, which has been going since 1267, it was described as an \u201cancient tradition\u201d as early as 1852; arguably, nothing is more quintessentially English.</p> <p>Traditionally, competitors frame their chiselled phizogs with a horse halter known as a \u201cbraffin\u201d before performing the gurn. This involves using the bottom lip to grip as much upper face as possible, not dissimilar to the pouting duck-face so beloved of the selfie generation. Contestants are ordered to \u201csnarl like a dog, look savage, distort the countenance\u201d and are banned from wearing make-up, though as with competitors in similar disciplines such as boxing, diving and gymnastics, they cannot legislate for the impressionistic scoring that decides their fate.

Standing in front of a panel of judges, participants compete to see who can withstand the pain of the subsequent escape attempts the longest. While the one-minute mark was long considered a milestone for \u201ckeeping \u2019em down\u201d, the world record for ferret legging is an astonishing five hours and 26 minutes and is held by the late Reg Mellor, a native of Barnsley who pulled off his heroic feat in 1981, in front of 5,000 witnesses at the Annual Pennine Show in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/05/the-joy-of-six-sporting-pitch-fiascos\">The Joy of Six: sporting pitch fiascos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The history of ferret legging is unclear but the sport is believed to have originated in Britain, at a time when poachers who used to send their animals down rabbit warrens to scare out the occupants were obliged to smuggle their furry assistants past gamekeepers by hiding them in their trousers. As a test of manliness and a feat of sporting endurance, the practice became popular among Yorkshire miners during the 1970s but has since waned in popularity. Mellor may have shuffled, trousers bulging, off this mortal coil but his legacy looks likely to remain intact for eternity.</p> <p>The rules of the sport are simple, and no great finesse or skill beyond the capacity to endure extreme pain is required. All involved <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbrtKSr-HAM\">must be sober and sedative-free</a>. Each competitor must wear baggy trousers to allow free movement of the ferrets from one leg to the other with a minimum of fuss. Competitors are also obliged to go commando and are forbidden from wearing underpants, jockstraps or protective clothing of any kind.

It has two teams, a ball and a net with a clear objective. But imagine swapping your hands for your feet to get a ball historically made of rattan rather than leather over the net \u2013 then you have sepak takraw. The sport originated around the 15th century in south-east Asia and is now played in more than 100 countries, including the UK and US (seemingly brought to both by Asian students), though of course in both instances it is not especially well-participated in.</p> <p>Its popularity in Asia, however, is perhaps at its greatest level ever and, though professionally it is played on badminton-like courts, minimal equipment plus an ability to improvise makes it accessible for all. Thailand are currently the world\u2019s best team, with Malaysia, Singapore and Japan also strong. Indeed it is the national sport of Malaysia and commands significant media attention \u2013 in stark contrast to the focus it has received in the western world. In 2011 a deal was struck with Eurosport to broadcast the ISTAF World Cup but the agreement was not renewed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2912ecd0fffeecdbd2bb05aa53d2f6d62c24d3a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2912ecd0fffeecdbd2bb05aa53d2f6d62c24d3a7/0_194_3900_2339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burmese monks play a game of Sepak Takraw\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burmese monks play a game of Sepak Takraw at the Thirisaridar monastery inside the Mae La refugee camp in Tak province, Thailand, June 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the sport dates back more than 500 years, with several countries disputing who started it, the first known set of rules did not appear until 1829, written by the Siam Sports Association. Four years later the net was added but it was not until 1965 that international competition was formed, five years after the Asian federation was established. Efforts have also been made for sepak takraw to become an Olympic sport, but the campaign has fallen on deaf ears at the IOC. It has nonetheless featured prominently at the Asian Games, which are also held on a four-year cycle, since 1990 \u2013 Malaysia won the first two but the subsequent five titles have gone to Thailand. <strong>AS</strong></p> <h2>4) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIT3hODiccU\">Buzkashi</a></h2> <p>Traditionally played during the winter and early spring, Buzkashi is the national sport of Afghanistan in which players on horseback attempt to get the headless, disembowelled carcass of a goat or calf weighing up to 160lbs into a goal or scoring circle on a square pitch measuring 400 metres on each side. Literally translated as \u201cgoat grabbing\u201d, the sport has two variations: Quarajai, and Tudabarai, with both having similar objectives even if the rules of the former are more complicated. To take part in this extremely violent game, the horses, bred specially for the sport, and riders must undergo years of intensive training. Games could often last up to five days but are now restricted to two halves of 45 minutes by rules introduced by the Afghan Olympic Federation. These rules, which also dictate that each team has 10 members, are only adhered to in matches staged in Kabul.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6ea6e724cce5fcd5edbf97a69b2353ea9733447\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6ea6e724cce5fcd5edbf97a69b2353ea9733447/0_32_2632_1579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Buzkashi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Afghan horsemen compete during a Buzkashi game in Panjshir province, north of Kabul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ahmad Masood/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just as footballers tend to reach their peak in their mid to late 20s, the best Buzkashi riders tend to be men in their 40s, while the importance of their horses cannot be understated. \u201cBetter a poor rider on a good horse than a good rider on a poor horse,\u201d say the Afghans. The most successful Buzkashi competitors are sponsored by wealthy patrons, while the prizes on offer include money or expensive clothes. Arguably the most famous practitioner of the sport is Sylvester Stallone, who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp5sbOZRT0\">took to it like a duck to water in Rambo III</a>. Injuries are common, but players are expected to continue with broken ribs, head injuries and assorted other ailments as quitting is considered a sign of weakness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/welcome-to-the-world-nomad-games-if-genghis-khan-was-alive-hed-be-here\">Welcome to the World Nomad Games\u200b: 'If Genghis Khan were alive, he\u2019d be here'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps because spectators like to gamble on Buzkashi, the sport was banned for the duration of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, on the grounds that the rulers found it immoral. Confiscating the horses of those who played the sport, they put them to work at the moral job of helping the military instead. <strong>BG</strong></p> <h2><strong>5) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocy9uXXDE8M\">Quidditch</a></strong></h2> <p>And you thought it was just a fictional sport in a series of books about wizards.

There are seven players on each team with rolling substitutes. They are made up of chasers (who pass and score with the quaffle), keepers (self-explanatory), beaters (tasked with attacking the chasers with balls called bludgers) and seekers (whose sole objective is to catch the snitch, entering the field after 18 minutes of action).

Celebrants dress in colourful attire, wearing ski masks, special belts and even stuffed animal hats; men must wrap their hands. Then they take to the ring, made out of everyone they know, and dish out windmill punches and kicks until someone falls down. The rules are beautiful in their simplicity: no biting, no booting someone when they\u2019re down, have fun! Any infringements are dealt with in the first instance by a referee armed with a colourful whip \u2013 no doubt the sensation is like being hit with a rainbow \u2013 but police are also in attendance in case things get out of hand because, amazingly, aunties pagga-ing is deemed perfectly fine.</p> <p>As you\u2019d expect, the simple brilliance of the idea has seen it spread to larger cities, with punters in Lima and Cuzco adopting the custom; prepare to wince and cheer in equal measure upon discovering its cultural appropriation by attention-seeking hipsters near you. <strong>DH</strong></p>",
  "<p>Landlords hand over as much as a fifth of their rent to letting agencies to look after a property, while tenants have to fork out a further \u00a3300 each. So should landlords be ditching the pricey high-street letting agents in favour of a raft of new online alternatives that promise to slash such costs and even axe fees to tenants altogether?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.noagent.co.uk/\">No Agent</a> is the latest firm to launch, claiming it will save a typical landlord \u00a31,600 in the first year, and leave tenants \u00a3337 better off. It joins a number of other online players such as <a href=\"https://www.upad.co.uk/\">Upad</a>, <a href=\"http://easyproperty.com\">easyProperty</a>, <a href=\"http://www.purplebricks.com/\">Purplebricks</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rentify.com\">Rentify</a>.</p> <p>The charges made by conventional letting agents can be breathtaking. For example, London and south-east agency <a href=\"https://www.foxtons.co.uk/help/fees/\">Foxtons</a> charges landlords 13.2% of the annual rent for finding a tenant, rising to 20.4% if the landlord also wants the agency to manage the property. Then there is a \u00a3420 admin fee, \u00a3165 to check-in a tenant, \u00a3150 for gas and electricity safety certificates (each), plus 12% of the value of any works above \u00a31,000 that need to be done on the property.</p> <p>Those are the charges that are levied on landlords. Foxtons then charges tenants a separate fee of \u00a3420 per property and \u00a3165 to organise a tenant check-out at the end of the tenancy. For someone letting a property at \u00a31,000 a month, fully managed by the agency, it means Foxtons will pick up around \u00a33,000 in fees in the first year alone.</p> <p>Letting agency fees vary markedly around England \u2013 and in Scotland fees to tenants are banned. According to David Cox, managing director of the Association of Residential Letting Agents, there are three levels of fees.</p> <p>The basic is just to find a tenant, handle the vetting and contracts. Typically it\u2019s around 6%-10% of the first year\u2019s rent, or, for a flat, a pre-agreed fee. The second level is to find a tenant and handle the monthly rent collection, usually 8%-12% of the rent. Finally, the full service of tenant finding, collection and management, including repairs, can be as high as 20% of the rent.</p> <p>Cox says the vast majority of landlords prefer to deal with a conventional high street letting agent, likening them to British Airways versus a no-frills airline. \u201cThe landlord is charged one fee and everything is included. The online agents often have what looks like a cheap basic fee, but then they bill you for everything else, such as viewings.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d0d29f76ac178ada7e96e95cb046efea5e09e0b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0d29f76ac178ada7e96e95cb046efea5e09e0b6/0_2_553_1224/452.jpg\" alt=\"rental table\" width=\"452\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>New regulations \u2013 such as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/check-tenant-right-to-rent-documents/who-to-check\">right to rent</a>\u201d immigration checks \u2013 are also encouraging landlords to use traditional agents to ensure they are complying with the law, he says.</p> <p>But the online agents argue they can do everything a traditional agent does, but at a fraction of the cost. Crucially, they are able to advertise on Rightmove and Zoopla, where nine out of 10 prospective tenants now find a property. Charges start at around \u00a3100 for advertising on the major property portals, to around \u00a3500-\u00a3600 a year for a full property management service, although a menu of charges is not unusual.</p> <p>For example, No Agent charges a flat fee of \u00a339 a month in London or \u00a329 outside for management. There\u2019s an additional \u00a390 to handle viewings for the first 30 days, \u00a390 for photography, \u00a365 for floor plans and \u00a390 for safety certificates. Tenants are not asked for a penny.</p> <p>Calum Brannan, the 27-year-old founder of No Agent, says: \u201cThe lettings agency market has been overpriced for way too long. For example, we don\u2019t charge for credit checks, but then Experian is almost giving them away. It gives you an idea of the huge mark-ups that traditional letting agents are making.\u201d</p> <p>But can a landlord really trust an online agent to handle the very human issues of finding tenants and dealing with issues as they arise, such as broken washing machines, or damp building up in the corner of a room?</p> <p>No Agent says it has a 24-hour call centre for tenants and landlords to ring, with a network of property professionals in every part of the UK who will handle issues as they arise. When it comes to arranging viewings, it promises that someone can be at the landlord\u2019s property the next day to show a prospective tenant around. Equally, it says, landlords are free to handle viewings themselves.Upad is the largest online letting agency, handling around 1,250 lettings a month. It charges \u00a3118.80 for its most basic service, which is getting the landlord\u2019s property advertised on Rightmove and Zoopla, through to \u00a3598.80 for its full management service, although it won\u2019t handle initial viewings.</p> <p>Founder James Davis says the key advantage of an online letting agent is that it lets landlords do the bits they want to do, while leaving the agency to pick up the rest. He says that 80% of landlords \u201cself-manage to some degree, and most want to meet the tenants face to face before letting\u201d. He adds that 90% of tenants say they would rather see the landlord at a viewing than the agent. \u201cOur model is less about cutting costs and more about offering a fuller service. We are probably the most expensive of the online agents, but we do a lot more hand-holding for landlords than the others.\u201d</p>",

When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?\u201d</p> <p>In her remarks before the gathering of prominent Hispanic leaders, Clinton reiterated her support for comprehensive immigration reform while decrying Trump\u2019s rhetoric against immigrants and Muslims alike.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no innuendo or dog whistles any more,\u201d Clinton said of the Republican nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s all right out there in the open now.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the day Trump reiterated his economic vision, pledging to voters that he would \u201clower your taxes beyond any number you thought possible\u201d at a rally in New Hampshire.<br></p> <p>The promise came just hours after Trump unveiled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/donald-trump-jobs-vision-25-million-economic-policy\">the latest iteration</a> of his fiscal policy at the New York Economic Club in a speech where he said he outlined the ambitious goal of creating 25 million jobs over the next 10 years. The Republican nominee promised to drastically slash taxes with savings coming from reducing federal bureaucrats whom his campaign has derided with phrases like \u201cthe FDA Food Police\u201d. Trump pledged that the result would increase economic growth from 2% to 3.5% and \u201cturn America into a magnet for new jobs\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s remarks came after her four-day absence due to pneumonia. Before the Washington event, she first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-returns-campaign-pneumonia\">returned to the campaign trail</a> with a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina. Taking stage to James Brown\u2019s I Feel Good, the former secretary of state said she took sick days to \u201creflect\u201d. </p> <p>Clinton told the crowd: \u201cBeing on the trail does not encourage reflection. It\u2019s important to sit with your thoughts every now and again and this helped me to reflect on what this campaign is all about.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton, who has been reluctant to take questions from reporters on the campaign trail, later held a brief press conference after her speech where she dodged repeated questions about when she told running mate Tim Kaine about her diagnosis. </p> <p>The subject of health was relevant for both candidates as an interview of Trump with television personality Dr Mehmet Oz <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/donald-trump-dr-oz-medical-report\">aired on Thursday.</a> There, Trump brandished a doctor\u2019s letter and insisted that, although he could lose a few pounds, he was in peak health. In December, Trump\u2019s doctor, Harold Bornstein previously published a letter that said Trump would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\u201d. The Republican nominee is a septuagenarian fond of fast food who doesn\u2019t exercise. </p> <p>The Republican nominee also continued his hostility towards reporters. Trump bragged at his New Hampshire speech that his travelling press pool wasn\u2019t able to attend, which he called \u201creally good news\u201d and proclaimed to a cheering crowd: \u201cI love it.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the day, he called for the New York Times to fire their respected national political correspondent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jmartnyt?lang=en\">Jonathan Martin</a> while also railing against CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, a debate moderator, because Cooper was \u201cvery biased\u201d and worked for \u201cthe Clinton News Network\u201d.</p> <p>Donald Jr joined in on the act when he told a Philadelphia radio station that \u201cthe media has been [Hillary Clinton\u2019s] number one surrogate in this\u201d. The Trump son added \u201cwithout the media, this wouldn\u2019t even be a contest, but the media has built her up. They\u2019ve let her slide on every indiscrepancy [sic], on every lie, on every DNC game trying to get Bernie Sanders out of this thing. If Republicans were doing that, they\u2019d be warming up the gas chamber right now.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton campaign quickly bashed Donald Jr\u2019s comments as \u201cinsensitive, divisive, and reckless\u201d. In a statement, the campaign added \u201cthe bottom line is this \u2013 offensive references to the Holocaust are never acceptable, especially from a presidential campaign\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Batman has always been defined by his Batwear. Tim Burton ushered in a new era for Gotham\u2019s dark knight by jettisoning the familiar colour scheme sported by Adam West in the much-loved 1960s show in favour of typically gothic black and an armored, musclebound look. <a href=\"http://www.dorkly.com/post/60798/why-the-nipple-suits-in-batman-robin-were-actually-brilliant\">George Clooney\u2019s awful Batnipples</a>, intended as a paean to classical visions of the gods, came to define the floundering Joel Schumacher years.

To be fair to West and the show\u2019s writers, it is hard to look menacing when you\u2019re wearing your underpants over a pair of tights, so a comic approach was probably advisable. And at least Batman\u2019s bargain bin gold utility belt always seemed to contain exactly the right weapon of choice to take down the relevant member of the caped crusader\u2019s rogues\u2019 gallery.</p> <h2>Michael Keaton\u2019s rigid ebony musclesuit</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a922ee14c5e880889aad2ea007196fd35086e7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a922ee14c5e880889aad2ea007196fd35086e7c/0_507_2393_1435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Keaton in 1989\u2019s Batman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Keaton in 1989\u2019s Batman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Five-foot-10, 160-pound Keaton might not have been the obvious choice to play Gotham\u2019s terrifying defender in the Tim Burton films, but who needs endless trips to the gym and a diet of raw eggs and protein powder when moulded rubber muscles and a fearsomely beaky cowl can serve just as well? Nevertheless, with the new black Batsuit featuring a design based on unyielding foam rubber that extended to his skull, the actor was faced with a whole new set of problems. Legend has it that the caped crusader\u2019s famous \u201chero turn\u201d in 1989\u2019s Batman and its 1991 sequel Batman Returns came about because Keaton simply had no alternative.

Apparently at the behest of Christian Bale, who found the costume uncomfortable, Morgan Freeman\u2019s Lucius Fox simply develops a cowl that\u2019s only loosely connected to the rest of the suit.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/19/books-interview-deborah-levy-hot-milk\" title=\"\">Deborah Levy</a> is a novelist, playwright and short story writer whose work explores memory and the messy intersections between identity, repression and depression \u2013 the people we are, the people we think we are and the chasm that can lie between. Her two most recent novels, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/07/swimming-home-deborah-levy-review\" title=\"\"><em>Swimming Home</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/27/hot-milk-deborah-levy-review\" title=\"\"><em>Hot&#xa0;Milk</em></a> have been, among other things, powerful investigations of identity under threat. They are populated by characters who can\u2019t seem to fully catch sight of themselves or each other. <em>Stardust Nation</em>, a graphic novel adapted from one of her short stories in collaboration with the illustrator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2008/jul/07/masterandmargarita\" title=\"\">Andrzej Klimowski</a>, is a troubling crystallisation of many of these ideas using the graphic form.</p> <p>Tom Banbury is a high-flying advertising executive; alcoholic but successful, he relies on \u201ca slight shamanistic edge\u201d. As he puts it, \u201cit is our job to crash into the unconscious of the consumer and broadcast a number of messages that end with \u2018buy this product\u2019.\u201d Unfortunately for Tom, as we begin the story, we learn that his colleague and friend Nick Gazidis has \u201csomehow extended his brief as Head of Finance and crashed inside ME\u201d. What this means is that Nick has absorbed traumatic memories from Tom\u2019s past and is repeating them back as if they were his own. This is not&#xa0;the first time Levy has explored the&#xa0;thin membrane between characters in her work \u2013 in <em>Hot Milk </em>she writes about a mother and daughter, the daughter limping when the mother does, \u201cmy legs are her legs\u201d \u2013 but here she takes this idea to darker and more surreal lengths. Tom\u2019s is a past full of trauma: he had a violent father who \u201cuncomfortable with the lack of excitement on home leave, he did tend to start small wars against his five-year-old son \u2013 usually with his leather belt\u201d. Nick suffers a breakdown as a result of \u201ctaking on\u201d Tom\u2019s past.</p> <p>It has been observed that Levy is a writer who builds her characters from inside out. She is far less interested in telling us how tall they are or what colour hair they have than in capturing the flickering self from within. And this&#xa0;presents an interesting tension within this work. In many ways, illustrations would seem to remove the need for many of the traditional hand-holding of literary fiction \u2013 she did this, I felt like this, he looked like this \u2013 but to begin with I found myself reaching for&#xa0;more. The central conceit of the story is powerful, but none of the characters seem to react to it. Klimowski\u2019s art, too, seems purposefully designed to&#xa0;deflect attempts at realist interpretation \u2013 the characters look as if they come from propaganda posters issued by their own broken psyches. It&#xa0;took me a while to get used to how everything in this story seems to be drifting past just out of reach. This is partly a representation of Tom\u2019s way of&#xa0;coping with his past \u2013 \u201cWhile he beat&#xa0;me I used to imagine myself somewhere else, away from Lt-Col. Banbury, away from my forlorn mother.\u201d Here he is shown in space as&#xa0;an astronaut. At another time of anxiety \u2013 telling his tutor that he is afraid, he projects himself outside on to the birds he is watching, and becomes a boy-headed bird.</p> <p>There is a horrifying, dreamlike logic to the relationship between text and imagery. Nick ends up in an asylum, confused about who he is, guarded by his sister, who Tom starts imagining as a guard dog, and dreaming about her as a three-headed Cerberus figure. By the end it seems that Tom\u2019s plan may have been to empty his bad memories into the vessel of Nick, that his reticence in showing an emotional response to Nick taking on his past is because it\u2019s all part of his plan. Which makes the moment when Tom tells Nick what eventually happened to his father even darker \u2013 Tom washing his hands of the guilt, passing it on to Nick.</p> <p><em>Swimming Home </em>was famously too literary for literary London. Although two Booker listings have presumably put paid to that, this is still a brave and&#xa0;unapologetically difficult book. For a readership used to the more straight-forwardly confessional tone&#xa0;of&#xa0;the memoir, which is still the graphic form that receives the most attention, things may be too oblique, never resolving themselves.</p> <p>Yet<em> Stardust Nation</em> leaves a mark, an&#xa0;echo of something unsettling made more unsettling by pinpricks of realism. There is a kind of joy in this slippage, in giving up on realism and delineation. As Tom says, \u201cDon\u2019t be frightened. We are all of us breathing in&#xa0;atoms that were once forged in the furnace of a star. There are tiny shards of your life inside them and their life is inside you too.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Stardust Nation</em> is published by Self Made Hero.

  "<p>When Nigel Farage set up Ukip it was to campaign for an EU referendum. I asked him at the time what he would do if he got one. He said he would try to win it. And what would he do if he won, or if he lost? Either way, he said, his job would be done. He would go down to the pub. Farage has been as good as his word.</p> <p>Ukip was no more than Farage\u2019s vehicle. It was not really a party but a lobby group for a single issue, that of securing a popular vote on whether or not to stay in the EU. It has achieved that aim.</p> <p>Ukip\u2019s purpose is fulfilled. The leader who gave it direction and distinctive personality has departed for the promised pub. The party should disband. Its work is done.</p> <p>The Ukip conference commenced with the assumed pretence that it is a \u201cproper party\u201d. Yet it is already displaying the symptoms of purposelessness that comes when any association has departed from its reason for existing.</p> <p>It is like Nato in Afghanistan. The party\u2019s leadership campaign is riven with faction. The candidates, pygmies alongside Farage, appear universally unappealing and ill at ease with each other. Mass defection seems likely to occur. Stopping that will be the chief task of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/16/ukip-conference-nigel-farages-last-speech-as-leader-politics-live\" title=\"\">the new leader, Diane James.</a></p> <p>To survive, a modern party requires not just a cause. It needs to be able to distribute the rewards of patronage and power to its members. It needs the smell of power, not just of influence. Ukip never was able to build up a group of MPs, as have the Liberal Democrats even in their worst hours. It has a presence, but no hold, in local government. There is no core group of loyalists to hold it together.</p> <p>The prevailing narrative is that Ukip is still needed to hold the May government to the Brexit cause. But the government has shown not the slightest intention of retreating from Brexit, however hard progress may be in that direction. The job of guarding Brexit has been taken on by a more substantial body, both in parliament and in the country: that of the overwhelming majority of the Tory party.</p> <p>Ukip has lost that capacity to dictate policy. The electorate stole it away and handed the task to the Tories.</p> <p>May is clearly determined to leave no room to critics on her right wing. She has been adamant throughout the Brexit debate that she will meet the central Ukip demand, of regaining control of Britain\u2019s borders and bringing a limit to mass immigration. If she fails, it will not be for want of trying.</p> <p>In addition, she has astonished even her own supporters by seizing Ukip\u2019s most eccentric policy, a return to the 1950s <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/education/2016/09/full-text-theresa-mays-speech-grammar-schools\" title=\"\">and a separatist secondary education system</a>. To want to divide Britain\u2019s teenage population \u2013 one-third, two-thirds \u2013 on lines of \u201cability\u201d and religion and, de facto, on income and social class is a move so retrogressive that Ukip should disband in May\u2019s honour on this cause alone. The bulk of Ukip\u2019s support over the past five years has come from people indistinguishable from the present prime minister.</p> <p>Ukip came into being in the steps of the short-lived <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum_Party\" title=\"\">Referendum party</a>. It has always occupied the vague, single-issue role on the party\u2019s right that the Greens have occupied on Labour\u2019s left.</p> <p>The party\u2019s fate is now to descend into the grimy fringes of British politics. Farage often spoke of the nightmarish members he had attracted, even as he succeeded in scuppering the old British National party.</p> <p>As moderate Ukippers return to the Tory fold, the party will be left with its least attractive faction, the racists and xenophobes who were so often Farage\u2019s curse: men and women whose sole common cause seemed to be a collective unpleasantness, and hatred for some perceived foe.</p> <p>Last June the British people rebelled, peacefully but emphatically, against what it saw as the ruling class. It was a gesture of democratic defiance: to some, an act of mob rule; to others, a great democratic uprising. The nation is still reeling. That the rebellion pumped adrenalin into Ukip\u2019s veins is understandable. It scored a remarkable triumph. But its job is done. It should respect those who gave it victory, and go.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/nigel-farage-aide-says-ukip-supporters-have-flocked-to-tories\">Nigel Farage aide defects to Tories claiming a mass exodus from Ukip</a> </p> </aside>",

It will only improve with time and they will find things easier when Granit Xhaka is restored to the starting line-up. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger rested the Swiss international for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/arsenal-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">the win over Southampton</a> and the trip to Paris, only bringing him off the bench with 19 minutes to play in the latter, and while it is a sensible move not to overexert a newcomer to the Premier League (perhaps Wenger has learned a thing or two about overplaying midfielders) he will presumably be restored to the team at Hull City. Xhaka was excellent in the away games at Leicester and Watford, and the thought occurs that it is exactly games like these \u2013 Premier League away matches where Arsenal have sometimes struggled for stability \u2013 where he will be needed the most. On paper there will be tougher assignments despite Hull\u2019s respectable start to the campaign, but if Xhaka can steer Arsenal quietly through this one he will have again done exactly what he was bought for. <strong>NA</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/ray-parlour-arsenal-wembley-tottenham-hard-lessons\">Ray Parlour: \u2018Arsenal got a few Champions League lessons at Wembley\u2019</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/13/same-old-arsenal-but-arsene-wengers-team-in-transition-earn-a-useful-point\">Barney Ronay: Same old Arsenal, but team earn useful point in Paris</a></li> </ul> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/liverpool-jurgen-klopp-strikeforce-sadio-mane\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp: improving Liverpool\u2019s strikeforce was almost impossible</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>3) Spurs to feel at home again with Sunderland visiting</h2> <p>Tottenham did a very good job of Spursifying Wembley on Wednesday night, plastering their livery on every available surface in the vicinity of the national stadium and hanging cockerel-bearing banners from every lamppost in the borough, but the fact remains that it wasn\u2019t <em>their</em> borough, and in the end <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/tottenham-hotspur-monaco-champions-league-group-e-match-report\">it was Monaco who took ownership</a> of the only part of town that actually mattered.

But it turns out that perhaps the biggest impact made by Pep Guardiola has been on his players\u2019 workload \u2013 last season Manchester City weren\u2019t even in the Premier League\u2019s top 10 hardest-working sides, ranked by the average distance covered by their players each game. This year they\u2019re at No2, just behind Liverpool (Bournemouth, last season\u2019s No2, are eighth). Kevin de Bruyne is City\u2019s top athlete, having covered 46km in his four matches so far (that put him sixth overall, with Burnley\u2019s George Boyd the overall leader on 49.6km). With his side playing more passes per match and enjoying more possession than any other, in the top three for total shots and pass accuracy and leading the league on goals scored and, of course, points won, perhaps Guardiola is aiming not just at victory but at total, across-the-board statistical domination. <strong>SB</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-fans-stop-champions-league-booing\">Pep Guardiola urges fans to stop Champions League booing</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/12/leicester-city-bournemouth-chase-udinese-midfielder-jakob-jankto\">Bournemouth and Leicester lead chase for Udinese\u2019s Jankto</a></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"623a5af2dffc12ad22cc7087da3b57851f1d2022\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/623a5af2dffc12ad22cc7087da3b57851f1d2022/0_79_3800_2280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pep Guardiola has had an immediate impact on his players as Manchester City manager.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pep Guardiola has had an immediate impact on his players as Manchester City manager.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5) A familiar feeling for Manchester United fans<br></h2> <p>Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s words after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/feyenoord-manchester-united-europa-league-match-report\">the dull Europa League defeat at Feyenoord</a> may have reminded you of someone. \u201cWe were just in control of the game and waiting for the possibility to win or not to win,\u201d he said of Manchester United\u2019s performance, adding that they were \u201cplaying at half-pace\u201d. United supporters have certainly become used to away reverses in Europe of late but Mourinho could more specifically have been describing any number of the games overseen during Louis van Gaal\u2019s tenure: control, but little in the way of dynamism or intent. It was a reminder that Mourinho\u2019s ideas will take time to translate themselves into action and suggested, too, that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/wayne-rooney-out-manchester-united-squad-feyenoord-europa-league\">absent Wayne Rooney</a> has not been the only encumbrance to United\u2019s attacking style. </p> <p>Paul Pogba is supposed to liven things up in the long run but Thursday saw his second sluggish performance of the week and United\u2019s other players cannot afford to wait for him to ignite. The predictable questions about his deployment have already been raised \u2013 the Manchester derby certainly passed Pogba by, to put it kindly, when he was paired deep with Marouane Fellaini \u2013 and looking through United\u2019s squad it is difficult to see a blend that you instinctively feel will click. They will win plenty of games under Mourinho but plenty of old habits have to be undone and no one should be too surprised if more bitter medicine is in store yet. A high-octane display at Watford, pointless at home so far, would be timely.<strong> NA</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/jose-mourinho-unhappy-offside-feyenoord-goal-manchester-united\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho says team deserved more after defeat to Feyenoord</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/picture/2016/sep/13/david-squires-on-the-manchester-derby-city-united\">David Squires on ... the Manchester derby</a></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Football Weekly Extra\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/283034279&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\"></iframe> <figcaption>Football Weekly Extra: Leicester batter Brugge and Celtic collapse in Barcelona</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6) Barkley\u2019s place in danger at in-form Everton<br></h2> <p>Those who watched Everton\u2019s game at Sunderland on Monday on Sky would have witnessed a particularly punishing moment of pundit-humbling. Jamie Carragher and Phil Neville spent much of the build-up to the game eulogising the ability of Ross Barkley, who proceeded to play poorly for 45 minutes before being substituted at half-time. Barkley may have been left out of Sam Allardyce\u2019s England squad but he had played all but six minutes of Everton\u2019s three previous league games this season, and started all but two of their top-flight matches last season (coincidentally he was also substituted at half-time the last time they visited Sunderland, last May). Now his place in the Everton team is in genuine peril, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/ross-barkley-must-raise-game-everton-ronald-koeman\">with Koeman publicly criticising his performance</a> both at the Stadium of Light and again in Thursday\u2019s press conference looking forward to the game against Middlesbrough. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/player/card/competition/attack/415799/8/100\"> <div data-embed-type=\"table\" class=\"player-card player-card--football\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <div class=\"player-card__image-container\"> <img class=\"player-card__image\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://sport.guim.co.uk/football/player-images/100/415799.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Ross Barkley\"> </div> <div class=\"player-card__player\"> <div class=\"player-card__position\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Midfielder</div> <div class=\"player-card__name\" itemprop=\"name\">Ross Barkley</div> </div> <dl class=\"player-card__stats\"> <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Appearances</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">4</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Goals</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">1</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Shots</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">10</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Shots on target</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">40%</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Offsides</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">2</dd> </dl> </div> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere was a reason to change him, he lost many balls,\u201d Koeman said on the latter occasion. \u201cWe showed [him] the clips, and there is no escape.\u201d Of his chances of starting this match, he said only that \u201che needs to improve, but we will see at the weekend\u201d.

Given the unconvincing start to their domestic campaign, and with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/liverpool-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\">last week\u2019s heavy defeat at Anfield</a> kicking off a run of nasty away fixtures that between now and November takes them to Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham, the champions cannot countenance failure here.

  "<p>Perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019ve just finished the Netflix series Stranger Things that I\u2019m preoccupied with different yet co-existent realities, playing out on different planes simultaneously.<br></p> <p>There are several different ways we could characterise this past week in politics. If so inclined, we could cast the cartoonish LNP backbencher George Christensen as <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/i-give-malcolm-full-marks-george-christensen-humble-backbencher-seizes-the-limelight-20160915-grgskh.html\">the most powerful man in Canberra</a>, a characterisation he\u2019d find both apt and delightful.</p> <p>We could conclude that politics is a bitch by noting that one of the most publicly minded, genial and least artful people I\u2019ve met in politics over the past 20 years, Ewen Jones \u2013 Christensen\u2019s north Queensland Liberal neighbour \u2013 won\u2019t be representing the voters of Herbert in the new 45th parliament, because he was taken out, in part at least, because of the swing to One Nation in Queensland. This week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/13/liberal-national-party-wont-challenge-herbert-election-loss\">the LNP decided there were no grounds to challenge the result</a>. A pity, this, because good souls in politics can be hard to find.</p> <p>We could scratch our heads about the enigma wrapped up in a riddle that is Peter Dutton, who, this week, provided his most heart-starting insight since that time during the election campaign when he said asylum seekers would come to Australia to steal our jobs and go on welfare. Continuing this quaint trend of don\u2019t sweat the obvious internal contradictions, Dutton in the space of one day appeared to say two contradictory things. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/peter-dutton-open-to-refugees-on-nauru-being-resettled-in-new-zealand\">suggested asylum seekers on Nauru might be resettled in New Zealand</a>, something of a thunderbolt, given the government has been saying the exact opposite for years.

This week was about doses of reality, measured out in different contexts, with different results.</p> <p>We can start with the political newcomer Liberal Julian Leeser, who achieved the rare feat of making Australian politics catch its collective breath when <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/julian-leesers-maiden-speech-prompts-the-sound-of-furious-compassion-from-the-house-20160914-grg1gh.html\">he shared a personal story</a> about his father\u2019s suicide in his first speech to parliament.</p> <p>Leeser recounted the day his mother had woken him from sleep to say Dad had gone. \u201cI got up from my bed to comfort my mum, trying to calm her. I went down the hall to my father\u2019s office, where he worked late into the night for his clients. There I found his pyjamas in a pile and on the glass-topped table in the hall, was a note, like so many of the notes from my father, written in red pen on the back of a used envelope. It said, simply: I am sorry Sylvia. I just can\u2019t cope, love, John.\u201d</p> <p>Leeser\u2019s stoicism in recounting the tale, his simple desire to say something real, to make the personal the political, instantly shamed the B-grade melodramas of the sitting week. Truth and clarity rang out in the House of Representatives like a bell.</p> <p>Politics also had to face up to the reality that Pauline Hanson had successfully clawed her way back into the subculture she was bundled out of in 1998.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/14/pauline-hanson-first-speech-senate-calls-for-immigration-ban\">Hanson is back with a new category of \u201cothers\u201d to scapegoat</a> as a ritualised salve for the alienation of white working-class blokes who believe they\u2019ve been stiffed by globalisation, and can\u2019t work out why the Australia they were born into in the last century appears almost unrecognisable to them in 2016.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/14/pauline-hanson-first-speech-senate-calls-for-immigration-ban\">Pauline Hanson calls for immigration ban: 'Go back to where you came from'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But this time, Hanson delivered her speech with the Indigenous leader Pat Dodson sitting diagonally across from her, hat off, back straight, beard flowing down the front of his suit, watching on unflinchingly; and she was followed immediately by Malarndirri McCarthy, who opened her first speech in her Indigenous language, the words lilting up through the Senate chamber to the large group of assembled family and friends, who cheered, and bawled, and held the Indigenous flag aloft with a punch of pure triumph.</p> <p>Politics had changed since 1996, there were now countervailing forces, possibly catalysed by the dogged persistence of her public ambitions. Hanson had moved on from the \u201cAboriginal industry\u201d in any case. So 1996.</p> <p>By Friday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/16/stephen-conroy-resigns-from-the-senate\">the Labor senator Stephen Conroy articulated his own personal reality</a>. After 20 years, it was time to move on to the corporate world. He departed with the pithy summation: \u201cWhen you resent being in Canberra because you are missing your daughter\u2019s soccer training it is time to retire from the federal parliament.\u201d</p> <p>Colleagues were wrong footed, because Conroy hadn\u2019t told all of them. He hadn\u2019t told the party leader, his sometime friend, sometime frenemy, Bill Shorten. Anyone who knows Conroy will know that this is how things generally are with him \u2013 stuff the talking points, snowboard downhill, at breakneck speed, minus crash helmet, never mind the concussion.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sensibly, Turnbull ignored this posturing and set about constructing a verb</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Conroy\u2019s New South Wales colleague Anthony Albanese, who was looking very zen about this turn of events, thought he might shovel a bit of reality back in the direction of a press pack so revved it was in danger of hyperventilation. This Conroy resignation looked incredibly strange. Where was Conroy, why wouldn\u2019t he front up and explain himself? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/sep/16/albanese-on-conroy-resignation-frankly-its-none-of-your-business-video\">Albanese was brutal</a>. \u201cThat is your problem. No one else\u2019s. Stephen Conroy told the Senate last night.\u201d</p> <p>After the dog bit the man (called Sam) last week, various forces aligned to ensure the man then bit the dog. The Coalition was persuaded that if you make a big political fuss about one senator and his propensity to ask Chinese business people to kick in with contributions, you might need to be seen to be doing something more systemic about reform of the donations and disclosure regime. Actually doing it is, of course, another matter \u2013 and on the doing front, we\u2019ll have to wait and see \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/turnbull-government-launches-sweeping-inquiry-into-donations\">but the joint standing committee on electoral matters was given a reference allowing it to take steps to improve a system desperately in need of substantial improvement.</a> Who\u2019d have thunk it? Almost grounds for hope.</p> <p>Then there was the prime minister, making peace with his own complicated reality. </p> <p>Malcolm Turnbull entered his anniversary week absolutely determined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/14/turnbulls-tipping-points-how-the-liberal-partys-saviour-failed-to-grab-malcolms-moment\">to turn around perceptions that he\u2019d achieved two-fifths of bugger all</a> since taking the leadership from Tony Abbott 12 months ago. This was partly a message for external consumption, to pacify the bobble heads who go on Sky News programs and ABC24 programs and talk incessantly about \u201coptics\u201d, or who write ponderously about seminal turning points; and partly a message for internal consumption, given Abbott was Around, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/14/malcolm-turnbull-says-labor-preaching-hatred-in-marriage-equality-debate\">being pacified by Alan Jones about the Terrible Injustice of one year ago</a>, burnishing some parallel reality where Abbott Could Have Done Better Than Malcolm. Never mind all those polls telling us the Coalition was heading for a stupendous rout. National affairs is no fun at all if you can\u2019t choose your own facts.</p> <p>Abbott has been saying recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/26/tony-abbott-urges-turnbull-to-pursue-reform-to-counter-populist-politics\">the Turnbull government must be different to its opponents</a>, which is code for saying the Coalition must exist in a state of rigidly inflexible purity inside its own ideological bubble, and continue with the unproductive tub thumping that killed his own prime ministership. This is a dispatch from a strange, disconnected universe where talking incessantly about doing something in a righteous manner exciting the shock jocks and the base is somehow better than doing it.</p> <p>Sensibly, Turnbull ignored this posturing and set about constructing a verb. The profound need for momentum in anniversary week drove the government to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/13/labor-under-fire-over-6bn-budget-savings-deal-with-coalition\">make peace with Labor on $6bn worth of budget savings</a> by actually having a negotiation rather than pounding the gavel. The increase in the tobacco excise also cleared the parliament, another nice thing to pacify the ratings agencies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/16/stephen-conroy-resigns-from-the-senate\">Stephen Conroy resigns from the Senate, taking colleagues by surprise</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not content with that, Turnbull decided this was the week to walk over and lift the club from Abbott\u2019s hand \u2013 the superannuation club he\u2019s been using to beat Turnbull and Scott Morrison and Kelly O\u2019Dwyer with behind the scenes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/superannuation-backflip-on-500000-cap-wins-over-coalition-conservatives\">A peace deal on the vexed super policy was settled and bowled up on the final sitting day</a>.</p> <p>If the price of that deal was having Christensen out, crowing like a year nine prefect in the Mural Hall about being the man of the moment, then that was a price worth paying.</p> <p>Then there was the plebiscite. The realities around the plebiscite are more vexed. Turnbull genuflected at the start of the week to the reality of the various demands conservatives were making \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/13/cabinet-approves-15m-public-funding-for-same-sex-marriage-plebiscite\">demands sufficient to kill the whole exercise</a>. He appeared to execute this submission willingly enough, but on Friday, safely past the pressures of the parliamentary week, a loose construction. The prime minister told the radio host Neil Mitchell that he might look to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/16/malcolm-turnbull-willing-to-negotiate-on-marriage-equality-plebiscite\">compromise in order to salvage the plebiscite</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s a flare. Turnbull is clearly saying to Shorten \u201cI will negotiate\u201d. You might ask on what? Well, a couple of things. It\u2019s possible the government could look to strengthening the protections against government-funded advertising being used to say hateful things. It\u2019s possible Shorten could get something approximating a joint platform on which to campaign. Perhaps there are other things that could be applied to the process to address some of the concerns about the plebiscite becoming some sort of sanctioned vilification exercise.</p> <p>The signal is limited, but it\u2019s also deliberate.</p> <p>So where does it end?</p> <p>Well that depends on how far both leaders can extend. Turnbull is completely ring-fenced by the plebiscite, his internal reality says it is that process or nothing. As for Shorten? It\u2019s a threshold question.</p> <p>Is the reality now that Labor does not want a plebiscite on any terms? Or is it more shaded? Is Shorten hesitating ever so slightly about locking Labor in, once and for all, behind killing the whole process, because he is prepared to deal?</p>",

The building\u2019s sloping tiers lean at the same angle as the tip of the Washington Monument.

With the forbidding air of defensive arrow-slit windows, these cuts frame views to the White House and the Washington Monument, to the Thomas Jefferson and Martin Luther King memorials a kilometre away, binding DC\u2019s ceremonial landscape to the African American story \u2013 and suggesting the museum is here to keep a watchful eye out.</p> <p>The design also draws on African precedents. The pagoda-like form was inspired by the crown of a carved figure on a veranda post, made by a Yoruba sculptor in west Africa, which Adjaye spotted in an overlooked corner of a Munich museum (it\u2019s now on loan here, with pride of place in the centre of the uppermost gallery). The filigree metal cladding is a reference to the decorative ironwork found on houses in Charleston and New Orleans, made by slave craftsmen. Adjaye has created his own abstract version, with a repeat pattern of 3,600 panels that have an organic, slightly sci-fi air. Somewhere between art nouveau and HR Giger, it gives the building the look of an exotic mothership, ready for takeoff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b5d5d1477df93a586c291a7aeee50a3b364f4fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b5d5d1477df93a586c291a7aeee50a3b364f4fc/0_42_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Powerful exhibits \u2026 statue of Tommie Smith and John Carlos giving the black power salute at the 1968 Mexico Olympics\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Powerful exhibits \u2026 statue of Tommie Smith and John Carlos giving the black power salute at the 1968 Mexico Olympics</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This chameleonic coat has a dark brown patina in some lights and shimmers bright gold in others, <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/BKTv0qUAyrd/\">shifting its character</a> as you pass around it. From some angles it gleams in the sweltering late-summer sun, but it\u2019s not quite as sparkly as planned. The intended cast bronze is now coated aluminium: bronze would have been too heavy, and the fixings couldn\u2019t be guaranteed for the Smithsonian\u2019s required 50 years. The plan for large surfaces of perforated metal (similar to <a href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/66619/m-h-de-young-museum-herzog-de-meuron\">Herzog &amp; de Meuron\u2019s De Young Museum</a> in San Francisco) also gave way to smaller repeat modules. These choices don\u2019t ruin the effect, but they lend the building a slight cheapness \u2013 a feeling that gets more pronounced when you step inside.</p> <p>Walking into the main entrance hall, past a reflecting pool and under a dramatic cantilevered concrete canopy, it\u2019s hard to shake the sense of an airport. Once you have navigated through the security obstacle course, you\u2019re left in a space of grey plasterboard walls and suspended ceiling tiles, and shuffled towards an elevator. <a href=\"http://freelon.com/lib/images/projects/1464.jpg\">Early designs</a> depicted a dramatic ceiling of undulating wooden stalactites, abandoned for reasons of practicality and fire safety. Adjaye isn\u2019t too concerned. \u201cSince I revealed that image eight years ago, it has become the most copied ceiling in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cNow it\u2019s even in Starbucks, it\u2019s been completely destroyed.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://instagram.com/p/BKTv0qUAyrd/\"                                                                        > <video src=\"http://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t50.2886-16/14370956_303057900059319_1967266375_n.mp4\" width=\"460\" height=\"820\" type=\"video/mp4\" controls frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></video> <figcaption>Video: changing patterns of light on the museum\u2019s exterior</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It might also have been out of his hands. Although credited as lead designer, Adjaye is one of four architecture practices responsible for the project, a cocktail of divided responsibilities that feels like too many cooks. The Freelon Group, headed by African American architect Philip Freelon, was the lead practice, with specific responsibility for the building\u2019s interior from the ground floor up. Davis Brody Bond, co-founded by another black architect, the late Max Bond, handled the interiors below ground. </p> <p>Long-time Smithsonian collaborator, SmithGroup, was in charge of the envelope and foundations, while Adjaye is described as the \u201ccreative force\u201d behind the \u201cformal development\u201d of the building: he came up with the shape and the key organisational ideas. The whole project, then, was co-ordinated in the cloud, using BIM modelling software, and there are moments where you sense the left hand might not have quite understood the right hand\u2019s intentions, areas that appear to have slipped through the contractual cracks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/aug/02/david-adjaye-interview-not-always-looking-at-usual-references\">David Adjaye interview: 'I'm not always looking at the usual references'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The circulation areas, housed in the gap between the outer facade and the gallery levels within, promised to be a dramatic sequence up escalators and along cantilevered landings, veiled by the lacy mesh. The result feels half-baked. From the inside, the cumbersome steel structure needed to hold up the facade takes up most of the view, while the impact of specially framed vistas to nearby monuments is lessened by clunky fixings.</p> <p>In the heart of the exhibition spaces, these niggles fade away.

A warren of low-ceilinged rooms give way to a gaping triple-height hall, lined with rough-textured grey plaster walls, and a winding route past such haunting exhibits as a whipping post and a segregated train carriage, slave huts and a stone auction block, along with an overwhelming number of artefacts, text panels, films and interactive video screens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"455288523531fb361d1586c6be06b5ccbbee7797\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/455288523531fb361d1586c6be06b5ccbbee7797/0_0_3000_1999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This wooden sculpture by Nigeria\u2019s Olowe of Ise wears a crown on which the NMAAHC\u2019s design is based.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This wooden sculpture by Nigeria\u2019s Olowe of Ise wears a crown on which the NMAAHC\u2019s design is based.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Things get cheerier upstairs.

(It\u2019s a feeling some Corbyn supporters, furious at being told their heartfelt beliefs are naive or electorally unpopular, may recognise.) However inadvertently, by holding three referendums in five years, Cameron gave people who don\u2019t normally get heard in general elections a voice and they\u2019re not about to give it up.</p> <p>And making the case for grammars, May explicitly tied the two things together. The referendum wasn\u2019t just about Europe, she argued, but a more widespread feeling of people being \u201cfed up with being ignored or told that their priorities were somehow invalid, based on ignorance and misunderstanding\u201d. Which is undeniably true, but leaves hanging the awkward ethical question of what a democratically elected servant of the people should do if the people\u2019s concerns ever did start to be based on ignorance or misunderstanding, or on evidence that crumbles to dust under cursory prodding. Point that out, and you\u2019re an arrogant elitist. Surrender, and they\u2019ll only blame you if it all goes wrong.

But outside, where facts increasingly bounce off voters enraged by the very word \u201cexperts\u201d, things can be very different. Personal experiences count. What May seems to be doing is responding to this changing mood as unsentimentally as she confronted the very different electoral challenges facing the Tories 15 years ago.</p> <p>What\u2019s often forgotten about her infamous \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/oct/08/uk.conservatives2002\" title=\"\">nasty party</a>\u201d speech is that she never told the party it was nasty; she merely observed that voters thought so, and therefore the party had to knuckle down and accept it. As the old saying goes, \u201cThe people have spoken, the bastards\u201d; it doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re right or wrong. She appears now to be applying the same brutally simple logic \u2013 call it populist or nobly democratic, depending on whether you like the results \u2013 to bigger and more dangerous&#xa0;questions.</p> <p>What makes education a particularly interesting example of knuckling under and accepting the popular verdict, however, is the particular people whose verdict is being accepted. It\u2019s a good indicator of how far the electoral ground is shifting quietly under all our feet, and not just because of this week\u2019s threatened boundary changes.</p> <p>The strongest advocates now of new grammars are not parents seeking good schools, but older people for whom school is a distant memory. Only 39% of people aged 35 to 44, the age group most likely to have children, support new grammars compared to 66% of over-65s, <a href=\"http://www.comresglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Independent-Sunday-Mirror_Political-Poll_August-2016-3215.pdf\" title=\"\">according to a recent ComRes poll</a>.

Hanson did, after all, dedicate a large majority of her address to Muslims and Islam, so it appears to be rather logical to seek a response from said community.</p> <p>Unfortunately for them, journalists and news presenters are usually met with a seemingly inexplicable wall of silence from the Muslim community. It may seem frustrating to some who are seeking a \u201cbalanced\u201d discussion, but it disguises much larger issues.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/14/pauline-hanson-first-speech-senate-calls-for-immigration-ban\">Pauline Hanson calls for immigration ban: 'Go back to where you came from'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Firstly, seeking comment from any representative on Hanson\u2019s speech on Wednesday night ignores the fact that she doesn\u2019t actually make any sense.</p> <p>It\u2019s one issue to try to respond to a thin veneer of logic, veiling a racist agenda, and another entirely to respond to an illogical rant. It would be challenging just to know where to start.</p> <p>Furthermore, in requesting a Muslim response on Hanson, there are implications that one single person can actually represent the entire Muslim community. Very often, comment will be sought from people like the Grand Mufti or the Head of the Australian National Imam\u2019s Council (ANIC), as though representation mimics a hierarchy.</p> <p>There is no hierarchy in the Muslim community, and there is no peak body or individual who can adequately speak on behalf of the entire community. Our community is made up of a complex web of ethnicities, backgrounds, sects, cultures, generations and political groups, with constant cross-pollination. There are no clear divides between these lines, and no one uniting factor.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.unisa.edu.au/Global/EASS/MnM/Publications/Australian_Muslims_Report_2015.pdf\">report by the University of South Australia in 2015</a> indicated there were 31 different nationalities that make up the community, with over a third were born in Australia. Similar research recently undertaken by the Scanlon Foundation has indicated that Muslims are just as diverse in piety and cultural expression. Less than 20% of Australian Muslims were born in the Middle East or Arab countries. Most Australians Muslims are Sunni but there is a significant minority of Shia and smaller numbers of Bektashis, Ahmadis, Alawis and Druze.</p> <p>It thus becomes inherently reductionist to request comment from one person on such a broad matter. It assumes a reduction of all these differing elements, squishing this broad community into one homogenous blob.</p> <p>This reductionism also largely characterises the narrative that currently surrounds Muslims. It is one that continues to reduce Muslims to caricatures, a narrative rooted in ways in which privilege shapes our society and our communities.</p> <p>It leaves a 1400-year-old intellectual tradition as nothing more than motivation for murder, reinforcing the already dangerous assumption that Muslims are to account for the violence enacted in the name of Islam and that Muslims have something to answer for.</p> <p>It would ignore the many complex root causes of such violence, ignoring the socio-economic, political and cultural factors at play, reducing it to a problem with Islam as a religion and not a societal one.</p> <p>This, in turn, divorces the government and the wider Australian society of any responsibility in actually addressing any of those root causes. It enables demands to be made of the Muslim community without any effort put into addressing the deeper issues. </p> <p>And it is here we find the biggest reason Muslims will not speak out in certain discussions of Islam and Muslims. Considering the utterly embarrassing lack of nuance and fact around the discussions of Islam, this position can be very frustrating. Why should Muslim leaders be complicit in reducing a far larger problem to one defined by one or two outlying senators? </p> <p>It would merely enable the continued demonisation of Muslims, allowing the conversation to be had on Hanson\u2019s parameters. Muslims, as a community, are left to respond to her every scrap, whether it be on a <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/08/16/its-just-toilet-multicultural-chief-questions-hansons-squat-toilet-outrage\">toilet bowl</a> or on welfare payments.</p> <p>This perpetual enforcement of a defensive position, this stripping of Muslim agency in a discussion of Muslims, leaves any Muslim representative a pawn in a rightwing race to the bottom of the xenophobia barrel.</p> <p>Navigating these spaces has proven nearly impossible. Journalists want a story that will gain traction, traction is often wholly reliant on the narrative, and so will ask relatively leading questions to get their quotes and their story.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/14/agenda-21-is-conspiracy-theory-but-dont-dismiss-malcolm-roberts-as-a-harmless-kook\">Agenda 21 is conspiracy theory.

Ultimately, they are all just in service of this narrative, and it dwarfs everyone involved, leaving the Muslim community with a catch-22.</p> <p>Either concede, and speak solely in response, thus reinforcing both the dehumanisation and the narrative above it, or stand defiant and have no one listen. In her speech, Hanson referred to an apparent \u201csilence\u201d from the Mufti, saying, \u201cThe Grand Mufti and other Muslim leaders are deafening with their silence, or lack of sympathy.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, we need only take a quick glimpse at the Mufti\u2019s Facebook page for his long list of responses to violence, whether it be in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dribrahimsalem/photos/a.406289879480757.1073741825.161934833916264/902403183202755/?type=3&amp;theater\">France</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dribrahimsalem/photos/a.406289879480757.1073741825.161934833916264/887560978020309/?type=3&amp;theater\">Istanbul</a> or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dribrahimsalem/photos/a.406289879480757.1073741825.161934833916264/764218850354523/?type=3&amp;theater\">Parramatta</a>. The lack of coverage of these responses, when the opposite causes mass outrage, is difficult to understand but unsurprising. It comes down to that very same reductionist narrative that fuels which stories are picked up and which are ignored.</p> <p>The problem with standing defiant, though, is that maintaining silence often leaves ravenous voices to take over the conversation and shred what little humanity Muslims can still demand. .</p> <p>True change in this area requires the media and the government to genuinely listen to the Muslim community.

  "<p>Derryn Hinch is unlikely to remember this, but way back in the 1980s I had a long, long lunch with him and several other journalists. I was editor of a television guide in Melbourne and he was the \u201cKing\u201d of talkback radio station 3AW. </p> <p>My memory of the lunch was that good wine flowed for hours, and so did the opinions of Hinch. He talked, a lot. He argued and held forth. He had a journalist\u2019s love of anecdote to prove a point and a radio presenter\u2019s self regard. I don\u2019t say that nastily. He was smart company, a big personality intensely interested in current events, who could puff himself up, but just as easily make a joke at his own expense.</p> <p>Watching Hinch\u2019s maiden speech to the Australian Senate this week, you couldn\u2019t help but witness his irrepressible personality, and wonder whether the 72-year-old Bearded One might turn out to be a good representative after all, in the sense of being candid, principled, sceptical of spin and tremendously energetic (when not nodding off). </p> <p>The crossbenchers who hold the balance of power in the Senate have their quixotic obsessions. Some like Pauline Hanson have ugly views on race and religion. Libertarian David Leyonhjelm is driven by ideology. Hinch says he\u2019s apolitical \u2013 a conservative on law and order but all-but a socialist on hospitals and medicine. He says he\u2019s going to listen and learn before making up his mind on legislation. Who knows? He just might end up an improbable voice of reason.</p> <p>Except for one thing: his sex offender crusade, and his determination to yell \u201cshame! shame!\u2019 as he names offenders in parliament. All perfect for a tabloid tub thumper, but not for a politician who aims to be more than a headline grabber.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/06/senate-reform-did-not-cause-pauline-hanson-to-return-heres-why\">Senate reform did not cause the return of Pauline Hanson. Here's why</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hinch has been a big figure in Melbourne my whole life, his career a roller coaster of highs and lows, loves and dramas, all revolving around Hinch. All have been played out in public to the point where many people, many times, have rolled their eyes and wondered when he\u2019ll disappear at last.</p> <p>That he has turned up as a senator five years after a donated liver saved his life is astonishing. He says he is \u201cgob smacked\u201d to be a senator after more than half a century working as a journalist, a job where you can criticise politicians as much as you like without having the responsibility of making decisions yourself. </p> <p>By his own admission, he\u2019s been sacked 16 times. He\u2019s been married five times, twice to Oscar-nominated actor Jacki Weaver. He\u2019s been rich and he\u2019s been poor. He\u2019s been convicted of contempt of court and related offences multiples times over his \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d sex offenders, and he\u2019s been jailed twice, the last time for 50 days in 2014. The Human Headline is, let\u2019s say, a character, and there\u2019s room for characters in politics.</p> <p>Listening to Hinch\u2019s debut was like tuning in to one of his radio editorials, but instead of lasting for a few minutes it went on for 47, surely heaven for Hinch. His speech skidded from topic to topic, from having met every prime minister since Robert Menzies, to covering the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, to opposing compulsory voting, to free speech, to dying with dignity, to paedophiles travelling to Asia, to ridiculing calls to ban Muslim immigration, to supporting same sex marriage. </p> <p>It was dizzying and entertaining, with Hinch full of confidence, his voice booming, his enthusiasm palpable. \u201cI will try to be an unpolitical politician, a commonsense politician,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not be politically correct. That is why I say from the outset that I have hopes, high hopes, of achieving good things.\u201d</p> <p>And yet Hinch couldn\u2019t help himself. His speech exposed the difference between a larger-than-life media commentator paid a lot of money to have provocative opinions, and a credible politician who does boring things like setting emotion aside to weigh up evidence and competing values. If he\u2019s going to be more than another Senate oddball known for grabbing media attention but little else, he\u2019ll get the difference. </p> <p>Hinch has been snubbing his nose at court-ordered suppression orders on identifying sex offenders for decades and he is a campaigner for a public national register for offenders. There is no doubt he feels passionately about this issue and no doubt he has considerable public support. And he has courage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/17/derryn-hinch-arrested-for-failing-to-pay-100000-fine\">preferring to go to jail in 2014</a> for breaching a suppression order rather than pay a large fine. Now that he has parliamentary privilege, there\u2019s no stopping him, and he named several convicted paedophiles, and vowed to name more.</p> <p>At least three of the people he named are subject to suppression orders in Victoria. Two of them he named at a rally in 2008, leading to five months\u2019 home detention for contempt of court (he would have gone to jail had he not been very ill at the time). How arrogant of him to name these men again just to make a point, knowing that if he did so outside parliament, he would have again broken the law. </p> <p>\u201cIt has been speculated that I will use parliamentary privilege to name names under the protection of what is derided as \u2018coward\u2019s castle\u2019, and I will,\u201d he said in his speech. \u201cBut it will be a court of last resort. I will not be a \u2018cowboy\u2019. But, if it is necessary to protect a child\u2019s wellbeing, then, damn right, I will name the human vermin.\u201d </p> <p>There was nothing \u201clast resort\u201d about his parliamentary stunt. It was a stunt. Even his arguments begin to wobble under scrutiny. His idea for a register is based on a US scheme that would allow the public access to a site that would include an offender\u2019s name, photograph, current address and criminal history. Hinch says the public has a \u201cright to know\u201d such information.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/26/derryn-hinchs-first-move-in-senate-will-be-to-oppose-ridiculous-media-rules\">Derryn Hinch's first move in Senate will be to oppose 'ridiculous' media rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Victoria\u2019s police commissioner Graham Ashton told 3AW this week that he understood the sentiment around such calls but the expert advice he had received was that there was <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/no-evidence-to-back-naming-sex-offenders/news-story/142907b8b16d0cd0997cc2018367e051 \">no evidence that it improved public safety</a>. He\u2019s right. <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-1899-7_17#page-1\">Study</a> after <a href=\"http:// https://www.hrw.org/report/2007/09/11/no-easy-answers/sex-offender-laws-us\">study</a> has shown that public registers have no impact on recidivism and do little to prevent sexual violence. The risk of vigilantes harassing offenders who have served their sentences is obvious. The prospects for offenders to get a job and rehabilitate would plummet.</p> <p>We already have sex offender registers in Australia, mostly for child abusers, but they can be accessed only by the police, not the public. Hinch says they are a PR joke, but the problems with them are not the ones he identifies. Ashton said that, in Victoria, there were now 6,000 people on the register, which requires a person to report to police and to provide up-to date-information including address, phone number, email, employment, social media use, interstate travel and even tattoos.</p> <p>The intent of the register was worthwhile \u2013 to protect the public and to help police investigate heinous crimes against children. Ashton said the problem was that there were so many people on it, it was impossible for the police to monitor it properly. That\u2019s the issue. There are far too many people on the register who pose little or no risk to the public and for whom constant monitoring is a waste of time and money.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.lawreform.vic.gov.au/content/sex-offenders-registration-final-report-html-version\">Victorian Law Reform Commission report</a> a few years ago said that if we keep going the way we are, there will be 10,000 people on the register by 2020, and that\u2019s just in Victoria (other states have similar schemes). </p> <p>These are the unintended consequences of politicians being pressured by people like Hinch and the law and order crowd who lazily demonise judges and magistrates for being \u201csoft\u201d on crime. Criminal barrister and vice president of Liberty Victoria Michael Stanton supports the register, but says it has become unwieldy and unworkable.</p> <p>Hinch\u2019s insistence that judges have far too much discretion about who they put on the register is wrong \u2013 there is no discretion in the vast majority of cases, one exception being where it is a child who has committed the offence. The commission recommended that to make the system work to actually protect the public, the government needed to \u201cstrengthen the scheme by sharpening its focus\u201d. In other words, give the judiciary some discretion and limit it to those who pose a continuing risk to children. </p> <p>One example the commission gave of someone who should not be on the register was a 19-year-old soldier who had consensual sex with two teenage girls which would not have been illegal but for their age. The judge had no alternative but to put the man on the register for life, even though she said he posed \u201cno risk to the sexual safety of the community\u201d. One consequence of being on the register is that a working-with-children check would mean he could never hold down a job that involves children. He could never even volunteer to coach a children\u2019s sporting team \u2013 for the rest of his life. </p> <p>The register is far from the only check on sex offenders. Victoria, like other states, has laws under which offenders who have finished their sentence but who pose a serious risk to the community can be subject to significant supervision, including restricting where they can live, continuing detention if necessary, preventing them from going anywhere near schools and other places where children gather, and wearing ankle bracelets to keep track of their whereabouts.</p> <p>As a journalist, I am sceptical of the large number of suppression orders issued in Australia, and will always argue that they should be kept to a minimum, with an open court system essential in a democracy. No doubt there are cases where suppression orders have been wrongly issued, yet in most cases they are put in place to protect the victim\u2019s identity. </p> <p>Hinch likes to portray a sex offender as a monster living across the road, but it\u2019s not true. Most children are molested by family members or someone known to them. In some cases, a suppression order is issued before an offender is released to give them a chance at rehabilitation, to get a job, find somewhere to live, and get on with a lawful life. In many cases, they are issued temporarily so an accused person can get a fair trial, a fundamental tenet of our justice system.</p> <p>In 2013, Hinch was found to have breached suppression orders by alluding to Bayley\u2019s extensive criminal record before he had pleaded guilty to the murder of ABC employee Jill Meagher. He revealed on his website that Bayley was on parole and on bail for other matters. It was messy \u2013 other journalists breached the order inadvertently, too \u2013 and there is a real question about the usefulness of suppression orders in an internet age when Bayley\u2019s crimes were all over the web.</p> <p>And yet, as horrific as Bayley\u2019s crime were, he was entitled to a fair trial without a jury being prejudiced by knowing his previous crimes. As it happened he pleaded guilty and the suppression orders were later lifted. Hinch was charged with breaching a suppression order regarding Bayley\u2019s record, refused to pay a fine and went to jail for 50 days, declaring himself a scapegoat and a whipping boy. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/12/derryn-hinch-uses-parliamentary-privilege-to-name-sex-offenders-in-maiden-speech\">Derryn Hinch uses parliamentary privilege to name sex offenders in maiden speech</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why? Bayley posed no threat to anyone at this point \u2013 he was in custody. Hinch wasn\u2019t protecting anyone by outlining Bayley\u2019s previous offences. In our system, even the worst criminals are entitled to a fair trial \u2013 without that, none of us are. These are principles Hinch dismisses as somehow tiresome and irrelevant.</p> <p>Let\u2019s take one more example. In his 2004 memoir, The Fall and Rise of Derryn Hinch: How I Hit the Wall and Didn\u2019t Bleed, Hinch recounted that he had sex with a \u201cstupendously beautiful\u201d model he met at a boozy party in 1979. Hinch was then in his 30s and says he thought the woman was in her mid 20s. But she told him over dinner that she was a girl of 15. Hinch called it a \u201cdreadful mistake\u201d and said he never saw her again.</p> <p>A few years ago, <a href=\"http://www.humanheadline.com.au/hinch-says/friday-thoughts-01-nov\">he claimed the woman had contacted him</a> and told him she was actually 17 at the time, so above the age of consent. But let\u2019s say she was 15 as Hinch believed for many years. Under current law, Hinch could have been charged with a serious crime. It would be up to him to prove that he had reasonable grounds to believe she was older. If he failed to do so, he could have gone to jail, and would certainly have been put on the sex offenders register. </p> <p>If Hinch had his public register, his photograph, address and crime \u2013 with no mention of the circumstances \u2013 would have been available for any member of the public to see. His marvellous career would have been over. Trying to find another job would have been hard \u2013 he could never work around children. He couldn\u2019t be a teacher, a tram driver, or even volunteer to coach a kids\u2019 footy team.</p> <p>Would that have been fair? Should we have labelled Hinch \u201cvermin\u201d and exposed his address so that parents could keep their children away from him? As simply as Hinch would like to portray these issues, they are not always easy. There are competing interests and principles. There are complexities and different paths to achieve what we want \u2013 a safer community. </p> <p>Hinch will get away with shaming sex offenders in parliament because he can\u2019t be held in contempt of court if he does so. But it would still be contemptible. For a person of considerable integrity, who could do good in his twilight career, it would be beneath him. </p> <p><em>This article was amended on 16 September 2016 to reflect the fact that Derryn Hinch did not reveal the nature of Adrian Bayley\u2019s previous crimes, but rather revealed that he had a criminal history</em></p>"
