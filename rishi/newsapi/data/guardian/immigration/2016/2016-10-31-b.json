At the time, 60 Minutes\u2019 story was so scandalous that, although it was largely right, the authenticity of key documents was questioned, and producer Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett as a fierce woman pushed to the edge of self-doubt) and anchor Dan Rathers lost their jobs.</p> <p>With Robert Redford cast as Rathers, the shadow of journo classic All the President\u2019s Men looms tall over Truth. Though Truth doesn\u2019t reach those heights, it\u2019s a pretty good iteration of the genre, wrapping you up in the ethos of table-slamming self-righteousness, just as a good journo movie should. And from the mad vantage point of the US election campaign, it\u2019s fascinating to see the disgracing of Mapes and Rathers as part of a broader political witch-hunt in what we thought at the time were the USA\u2019s gloomiest days. </p> <p>Truth is like a devoted fan\u2019s love letter to the great newsroom dramas that preceded it, and an enjoyable and smart film for a night in. </p> <p><strong>Film: Alice (1990, US), director Woody Allen \u2013 out now</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOsWXU06c8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oFOsWXU06c8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/25/woody-allen-traumas-in-life-weaken-us-cafe-society-amazon\">Woody Allen: 'There are traumas in life that weaken us.

Alice\u2019s treatments from a Chinese doctor (please turn your Hollywood-racism filters to HD) supernaturally switch off her inhibitions. </p> <p>There are two lovely observations at the heart of Alice: the first is that there is a particular type of person for whom infidelity is actually incredibly difficult, even when they desire it; and the second is that all types of people have ways of insisting on unhappiness via increasingly elaborate forms of self-sabotage. On the surface, Alice has everything she should want (wealth, a husband, lovely children); as a character, she also has the compassion of her film-maker \u2013 an unusual thing to treasure in an Woody Allen film.</p> <p><strong>Film: Volcano (Ixcanul) (2015, Guatemala/France), dir.

Our Mayan heroine Mar\u00eda is set for a local arranged marriage, but yearns to run away with another man, Pepe, for a new life in the United States. She is torn: \u201cWhat else is there?\u201d in the US, she asks Pepe. \u201cMoney. Dollars,\u201d he replies while the camera remains on Mar\u00eda\u2019s face. \u201cWhat does the air smell like there?\u201d He doesn\u2019t know. \u201cHere, the air smells of coffee. And of the volcano.\u201d </p> <p>The really special thing about Volcano is its palpable creation of this remote place, with clean cinematography that captures life in the plantation in long, wide, unmoving shots. Through that honest film-making approach, debut writer-director Jayro Bustamante lets the story unfold like a fable, and makes Volcano a lovely, living eulogy to a culture that may soon be lost. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/23/frackmans-accidental-activist-theres-blood-in-the-water-and-im-the-shark\">Frackman</a> (film, 5 November), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/06/nightcrawler-review-jake-gyllenhaal-toronto-film-festival\">Nightcrawler</a> (film, 18 November), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/what-we-do-in-shadows-review\">What We Do In the Shadows</a> (film, 25 November), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/19/20000-days-on-earth-review-nick-cave-artistic-legacy-documentary\">Nick Cave: 20,000 Days on Earth</a> (film, 27 November), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/26/no-activity-patrick-brammall-and-darren-gilshenan-deliver-australian-farce-at-its-finest\">No Activity</a> (TV, season one, out now)</p> <h2>Netflix Australia</h2> <p><strong>TV: Black Mirror, season three (2016, UK), created by Charlie Brooker \u2013 out now</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvvMdJUz3rc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rvvMdJUz3rc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/21/black-mirror-review-charlie-brooker-nightmare-sterile-world-is-only-five-minutes-away\">Black Mirror review \u2013 this nightmare sterile world is only five minutes away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no cure for the internet. It\u2019ll never go away.\u201d It\u2019s always been pessimistic, but episode three of Black Mirror\u2019s new season delivers the dystopian drama\u2019s thematic mandate in two brutal sentences.</p> <p>Now a Netflix Original, the latest Black Mirror instalments continue the template set early in the series: each hour-long episode is a self-contained, speculative science-fiction about one element of technology gone rogue \u2013 episode one, for instance, shows a Pinterest-y pastel world in which every person is reduced to a numerical rating via a social media app \u2013 with a twist in the final moments that usually sends the protagonist to madness, social expulsion or death. </p> <p>The difference now is that showrunner Charlie Brooker\u2019s bleak outlook is increasingly expressed in classical horror conventions, most notably in episode two\u2019s haunted house concept. Black Mirror is not always subtle and never light viewing, but it remains anchored in beautifully observed truths about how tech amplifies existing anxieties and unhappinesses.</p> <p><strong>TV: The Crown, season one (UK/US, 2016), created by Peter Morgan \u2013 4 November</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTfo44bGXdg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qTfo44bGXdg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Netflix\u2019s entry into British longform storytelling and the company\u2019s most expensive production to date, The Crown is indeed a must-watch \u2013 but not for the reasons you might think. </p> <p>Based on a viewing of the first two episodes, Netflix has applied the sensibility of prestige UK film-making to television production: Stephen Daldry (The Reader, Billy Elliot) directs a script from Peter Morgan (The Queen) presenting an origin myth of Queen Elizabeth II, beginning with the decline of King George VI\u2019s health in late 1940s and newlywed Elizabeth\u2019s premature ascent to throne. </p> <p>With its original programming, Netflix\u2019s genius may be its ability to tap into the cultural zeitgeist of each country: where House of Cards is a melodramatic thriller that undermines US political institutions, The Crown is an immaculately-art-directed propaganda biopic aimed at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/27/the-crown-writer-peter-morgan-ducked-chance-to-meet-queen\">humanising those in the monarchy</a> and positioning the Queen as a kind of proto-feminist. </p> <p>Mmmmm, politically dubious addictive longform prestige trash.

  "<h2>1) Vettel brings the noise</h2> <p>Radio Sebastian Vettel is becoming something that should be confined to a post-watershed time slot. His increasingly erratic and expletive-laden messages are upsetting people in much the same way that the late, great John Peel did when he brought punk to the airwaves in 1976. Red Bull\u2019s Helmut Marko, with whom Vettel had been very close during his championship-winning years at Red Bull, was certainly unimpressed. \u201cThe situation is unworthy of a four-time world champion,\u201d he said. \u201cHis choice of words certainly wasn\u2019t first-class.\u201d</p> <p>Many will have been offended and his decision to send a message to the race director, Charlie Whiting, to \u201cfuck off\u201d was absolutely uncalled for, especially given Whiting\u2019s dedication and long-term commitment to the sport, not to mention his skill and professionalism that is admired across the paddock.</p> <p>But equally Vettel\u2019s exasperated missives from the cockpit are without doubt entertaining. Modern drivers are routinely criticised for being PR-trained automata, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/30/lewis-hamilton-formula-one-emerson-fittipaldi\" title=\"\">indeed Emerson Fittipaldi praised Lewis Hamilton this weekend</a> for being one of the few to show real personality, so should Vettel really take so much flak for being human? Had he reacted entirely calmly after Max Verstappen failed to give back the place Vettel believed he had earned, it would have been exceptionally unemotional and hugely dull.</p> <p>Vettel is clearly frustrated at the position Ferrari are in, with no wins this season, no advance towards Mercedes and third in the constructors\u2019 championship to Red Bull. But he is also a grown-up and, as Christian Horner noted, if you miked up footballers the results would doubtless put Vettel\u2019s outbursts in the shade. If there is real concern his language is corrupting the nation\u2019s kids \u2013 as many thought Peel spinning the Damned and the Pistols was \u2013 then FOM need not broadcast them. But the show would be poorer for it.</p> <h2>2) Confusion rules over cutting corners</h2> <p>Lewis Hamilton, suffering with glazed brake discs from the formation lap, locked up on entering turn one and cut the corner to maintain his lead from pole but escaped censure. Verstappen cut the same corner while Vettel was attempting to pass and took a five-second penalty that cost him his podium spot.</p> <p>That there appeared to be a double standard caused considerable debate and plenty of vexatious remarks from drivers. Verstappen and his Red Bull team-mate, Daniel Ricciardo, were extremely vocal post-race in criticising the lack of sanction against Hamilton and it certainly will have made little sense to casual fans of the sport. In fact the stewards did look at the incident involving the British driver. They concluded he had not gained any lasting advantage from cutting the corner and looked at telemetry that showed he had in fact backed off immediately afterwards. That Nico Rosberg was some way back and tussling with Verstappen through the corner would have been a factor, as was the deployment of the safety car shortly afterwards which brought the cars together again.</p> <p>In contrast Verstappen was adjudged to have maintained his place ahead of Vettel only by cutting the corner and hence was punished. He, with his usual enthusiasm, vehemently denied that Vettel had got ahead, but the stewards examined all the data and angles and will have been in a better position to make that call than the driver.</p> <p>None of which makes it necessarily clearer to viewers just tuning in for the race on a Sunday but it does highlight the issue that going off should carry some forfeit. Again here perhaps the return of some form of gravel trap, an imposition to speed and the state of the tyres, would be useful, or indeed raised curb chicanes that force the driver to slow before rejoining would be worth investigation. If Hamilton had faced some form of obvious impairment for going off, the question of an official penalty would not have needed to be raised.</p> <h2>3) Ecclestone\u2019s plan highlights a real problem</h2> <p>Hamilton\u2019s off-track excursion had been to an extent pre-empted by Bernie Ecclestone, increasingly sounding like almost a fringe group of one in F1, even before the race weekend began. He had suggested that 40cm-high walls on the corners would increase the danger and the excitement of the sport and was almost universally panned.</p> <p>Rosberg, who had already given short shrift to another Ecclestone comment that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/27/nico-rosberg-bernie-ecclestone-jibes-f1-title-mexican-gp\" title=\"\">his taking the title would not help the sport</a>, had even less time for this idea. \u201cThere are 10 other areas which we should look at, if we want to make the sport even better than it is, before we start looking at turning back time on safety,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Various other drivers agreed and Jenson Button, a director of the Grand Prix Drivers\u2019 Association, was pithy. \u201cIt would be good for advertising in the sport \u2013 the sponsors,\u201d he said drily, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a pointless comment to comment on.\u201d But he and Daniel Ricciardo did acknowledge that it had raised an issue that really must be dealt with \u2013 staying within track limits.</p> <p>Currently the rules vary from circuit to circuit as does their enforcement and of course drivers exploit them everywhere to take advantage. The FIA World Endurance Championship race director, Eduardo Freitas, makes track limits clear before every meeting and rigidly enforces them with warnings and then penalties during races. A technique which would at least be a good place to start.</p> <h2>4) F1 belongs in Mexico</h2> <p>The numbers at the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez were huge in 2015 \u2013 134,850 \u2013 second only to Silverstone and this year they were even better with 135,026 fans packing the circuit in Mexico City. Interest was expected to be high after absence from the calendar for 23 years but bucking the traditional drop-off in year two is an extraordinary achievement.</p> <p>There are two factors at work here. The first is fairly straightforward \u2013 Mexico loves F1. There is a motor racing heritage here \u2013 38,000 attended the WEC race in September \u2013 but a long-standing, deep-seated passion for Formula One in particular. It was clearly evident from Friday practice when swarms of fans, bedecked in team merchandise, arrived before any cars had gone out and filled the circuit to a level that many tracks would gladly take on a Sunday.</p> <p>Trackside in the stadium section during FP2, to hear the roar every time Sergio P\u00e9rez and Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez went past was an absolute pleasure and their presence certainly helps, but it is really further evidence that taking the sport to a decent track (which it still is, even post-Herman Tilke remodelling), where there is genuine passion for the sport, does work.</p> <p>It has also been promoted exceptionally well. \u201cJoin the \u2018F1esta\u2019,\u201d proclaimed the posters that were spread blanket-like all over town. The city\u2019s myriad underpasses hosted huge, long pictures of a sequence of cars and, as one drove through them, it triggered speakers blaring out engine sounds \u2013 which was innovative and a sure-fire way to stir the heart of fans. A public-private partnership, the organisers have tried to price tickets to take account of local incomes and not just sat back and waited for them to buy.</p> <p>A full track promotes the city better than a half-empty one and makes the TV coverage all the more spectacular. Some circuits will never attract such interest but they could at least make the effort as Mexico has done.</p> <h2>5) The Hulk is making his mark</h2> <p>He was a winner of the Le Mans 24 Hours with Porsche in 2015 but Nico H\u00fclkenberg has still to stand on the podium in Formula One after 113 starts and six years competing in the sport. It is a record he will not take pleasure in but one that Mexico proved again surely cannot last.</p> <p>He will join Renault, a works team, next year and they will expect to be vastly more competitive than this season. Now they have had the manufacturers\u2019 full backing this year in developing 2017\u2019s car, their engine should also make a further step forward \u2013 it is already performing well in a car with a good chassis as Red Bull finish the season second only to Mercedes. They will expect much from H\u00fclkenberg and he showed it at the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez.</p> <p>He qualified exceptionally strongly in fifth ahead of the two Ferraris, only two-tenths of a second back from the fourth-placed Red Bull of Ricciardo and a full seven spots ahead of his team-mate Sergio P\u00e9rez, who was in identical machinery. His race was equally impressive, even given his spin while battling Kimi Raikkonen and seventh, the first place outside the big six, even after the musical chairs of the stewards had been completed, was another strong run \u2013 and three ahead of P\u00e9rez.</p> <p>It was crucial for his team as well; with the two Williams finishing in eighth and ninth, these were vital points to keep Force India nine ahead of the Grove-based squad in the battle for fourth in the constructors\u2019 championship. Renault will expect similar, while the Hulk will be happy with a car that can help him achieve that elusive podium finish.</p>",

And recent events suggests he may have a fine grasp of the dark arts of political spin.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/31/mark-carney-hasnt-just-played-a-political-game-hes-won-it-hands/\">The Telegraph\u2019s James Kirkup argues</a> that Carney has played a blinder this month, by using the attacks from Brexit supporters to spark a debate about his future.</p> <p>The key to the saga is Carney\u2019s declaration last week that his decision on whether to stay or go in 2018 was \u201centirely personal\u201d. That sent the hare running.... and it got a second burst of speed when various Carney \u2018friends\u2019 suggested he was leaning towards a return to Canada.</p> <p>Kirkup explains how Carney outfoxed his detractors within Theresa May\u2019s government: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Before the row over his ideological commitment to Brexit blew up, there was a perfectly respectable question to be asked about Mr Carney\u2019s future based on his competence as a central banker. Some of his policies, especially \u201cforward guidance\u201d about rates, have been less than impressive, leading to confusion instead of the clarity he promised.</p> <p>But the Carney-bashers have allowed that debate to shift from economics into politics, an arena where Mr Carney does rather well. He understood that Mrs May could not afford to have markets and investors (and even some voters) see Brexit Britain as the sort of country where the central bank governor can be purged for failing to pass a political purity test. </p> <p>Simply, it might (just) have been viable to let Mr Carney go for being incompetent, but it wasn\u2019t sensible to do so for reasons of politics. The Governor saw that and upped the ante accordingly: he could afford to walk away; could Britain afford to have him go?</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jameskirkup/status/793092190746599428\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Mark Carney hasn&#39;t just played a political game, he&#39;s won it hands down <a href=\"https://t.co/DysNcGVOMT\">https://t.co/DysNcGVOMT</a> via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TelegraphNews\">@telegraphnews</a></p>&mdash; James Kirkup (@jameskirkup) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jameskirkup/status/793092190746599428\">October 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581751a8e4b0219a00d3a9e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T14:19:01.101Z\">2.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s our latest news story on Mark Carney\u2019s future, by economics editor Larry Elliott: </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/theresa-may-support-mark-carney-full-term-bank-of-england-governor\">May backs Carney to serve full term as Bank of England governor</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58174ea7e4b01c528432e9c4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T14:12:54.621Z\">2.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">A quick catch-up</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Right, let\u2019s quickly recap before Mark Carney emerges from his meeting at Number 10 Downing Street.</strong></p> <p>The future of Britain\u2019s central bank chief could be decided soon, following a weekend of speculation that has gripped the City.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-bank-of-england-speculation-eurozone-gdp-business-live?page=with:block-5816f394e4b08d944ba4c7f7#block-5816f394e4b08d944ba4c7f7\">Mark Carney is meeting with Theresa May now, less than a day after the Financial Times reported that he was ready to serve another three years as Bank of England governor</a></strong>.</p> <p>Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman has already signalled that the government backs Carney, following several days of criticism from politicians who campaigned for Brexit.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-bank-of-england-speculation-eurozone-gdp-business-live?page=with:block-58172d71e4b01c528432e925#block-58172d71e4b01c528432e925\">The spokeswoman said that Carney was \u201cabsolutely\u201d the right man to run the BoE, saying</a></strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The PM has been clear in her support for the governor, the work he is doing for the country.

  "<p>Liberal democracy and free market capitalism are under threat unless governments do more to tackle inequality, the US Treasury secretary has warned on a visit to the UK.</p> <p>Jack Lew <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-treasury-lew-idUKKBN12V14Z\">called for Britain and the EU to ensure their economies remain \u201chighly integrated\u201d when Britain leaves the bloc</a>. He linked the vote for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> to a more general rise in anxiety among people over how economies have evolved and the \u201clopsided\u201d nature of gains.</p> <p>With just over a week to go to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">US presidential election</a> and against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/democratic-senators-fbi-director-comey-clinton-emails-letter\">the backdrop of a tight race</a> between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, Lew told an audience in Oxford that populism was on the rise in many countries, calling it \u201ca challenge in so many parts of the world right now\u201d.</p> <p>Lew told the Oxford Union debating society: \u201cClearly it was an issue during the vote here and the decision whether or not to remain part of the European Union. It\u2019s clearly a part of the elections taking place in the United States this year. And if you look around in Europe, it\u2019s part of elections in so many countries in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>He said people\u2019s worries about their economic situation and economic prospects stemmed from many sources, including technological changes and globalisation.</p> <p>\u201cIn the United States \u2013 and I would hazard to say that this is true here in the vote for Brexit \u2013 there is some anxiety that flows from the way that the modern economy has evolved that is looking for a solution,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t people feel good? They are looking at an economy that increasingly seems lopsided,\u201d he added, saying many workers who paid tax felt wronged by what they saw as a business tax system where \u201con the international side you see a whole lot of international firms organising themselves to avoid paying in some cases any taxes\u201d. </p> <p>The onus was on government to reform the tax system, to increase investment in people so that they have the right education and skills for the modern workplace and to spend on infrastructure, according to Lew, who has served as Treasury secretary under the US president, Barack Obama, since 2013 after a stint as White House chief of staff.</p> <p>Without such moves, he predicted drastic long-term consequences. \u201cWe run the real risk that middle class, working class people say, \u2018I see the economy is growing but I don\u2019t see how I am going to benefit from it.\u2019 The danger, if that is where things drift to, is not just a short-term political one, I actually think it\u2019s a fundamental threat to liberal democracy and to free-market capitalism.\u201d</p> <p>Without referring specifically to Trump and his proposal to build a wall between the US and Mexico, Lew also addressed rising concerns among voters over immigration.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a history [in the US] of \u2018everyone should have an opportunity\u2019, and you look at the way the modern economy has evolved and people are beginning to question that proposition. </p> <p>\u201cWhen people question that proposition they lash out and historically one of the places people lash out is against outsiders. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprise to see that when people are anxious they lash out on issues like immigration. But the answer is not to put up borders that are impermeable \u2026 but it\u2019s also not to ignore the anxieties,\u201d Lew told his audience in Oxford.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/27/theres-comfort-gdp-figures-early-days-philip-hammond\">There's comfort in the GDP figures \u2013 but it's strictly early days</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Touching on a debate at the heart of the UK\u2019s referendum battle, when pro-Brexit MP Michael Gove remarked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/09/michael-gove-experts-academics-vote\">\u201cpeople in this country have had enough of experts\u201d</a>, Lew also raised concerns about widespread scepticism over fact-based analysis. </p> <p>\u201cI fear that there is a growing distrust of authorities in general \u2026 The alternative to relying on expert analysis is making decisions more emotionally and that worries me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He also championed US efforts to strike free trade deals but said politicians had a responsibility to convey to people how those trade deals were improving economic growth and living standards. Barriers, on the other hand, hindered economic growth, he added, in another apparent dig at Trump\u2019s protectionist policies.</p> <p>Lew also congratulated himself and his administration for progress made on shoring up financial stability since the global crisis. </p> <p>He said conversations with big banks in the week after the Brexit vote showed him that moves to build up capital and readiness to deal with shocks was paying dividends. But he stressed that the fact the global economy had been able to withstand shocks like the referendum should not lead to complacency.</p> <p> \u201cWe should never take our eye off the ball in terms of asking what is the threat of the future \u2026 False complacency is a thing to worry about,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Earlier on Monday, Lew met bank bosses in London. Following the discussions, his spokeswoman relayed his pleas for an orderly Brexit process. \u201cThe secretary reiterated that a transparent, smooth and cooperative process that results in a highly integrated economic relationship is in the best interests of Europe, the United States, and the global economy,\u201d she said.</p>",

He told MPs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Through many conversations I, and my colleagues had, here and in Japan, it became clear that four reassurances were important to securing the investment for Britain.</p> <p>Three were about the automotive sector generally and one was about Brexit.</p> <p>These were</p> <p>1 - That we would continue our successful and longstanding programme of support for the competitiveness of the automotive sector, including Nissan.</p> <p>This support is available to firms for skills and training of the local workforce, for research and development and innovation \u2013 in line with EU and UK government rules.</p> <p>Since 2010 the government has invested \u00a3400m into the UK automotive sector in this way and we will continue to invest hundreds of millions more over the coming years.</p> <p>All proposals of course \u2013 from any company \u2013 must be underpinned by strong business cases and tested against published eligibility criteria. All proposals are subject to rigorous external scrutiny by the Independent Industrial Development Advisory Board and are reported on to parliament.</p> <p>2 - We would continue our work with the automotive sector, including Nissan at Sunderland, to ensure that more of the supply chain can locate in the UK, and in close proximity to the major manufacturing sites. In a previous post I established the local growth deals and the city deals which working with Local Enterprise Partnerships, have provided a way in which local councils, businesses and the government can upgrade the sites, especially sites brought into use from dereliction, and to provide the infrastructure for small and medium-sized businesses that can supply these major companies. This programme I can confirm will continue and with vigour</p> <p>3 - We would maintain a strong commitment to research and development and in particular to the take-up of ultra-low emission vehicles.

Clark has not published the letter the government gave to Nissan that helped secure the investment, but he spoke about the assurances in some detail yesterday in an interview that shed considerable light on how the government will approach Brexit.</p> <p>Over the summer, and at the Conservative conference, Theresa May suggested that her Brexit priority would be getting control of immigration, even if that meant limiting access to the single market. Clark\u2019s comments yesterday suggested that in recent weeks there may have been something of a rethink, because<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/nissan-eu-tariff-free-brexit-sunderland\"> he implied Downing Street want a free trade relationship similar to the single market and customs union.</a></p> <p>Clark\u2019s interview has already prompted much analysis.

If you conduct the negotiations in a serious, constructive and civilised way there is a lot in common that we can establish.

This is a very important consideration when looking at the necessity for an inquiry or independent review and the public interest to be derived from holding one.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She says policing has changed \u201cfundamentally\u201d since 1994, and she implies this makes it very unlikely that the Orgreave events could happen again.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There have been very significant changes in the oversight of policing since 1984, at every level, including major reforms to criminal procedure, changes to public order policing and practice, stronger external scrutiny and greater local accountability.</p> <p>The operational delivery and practice of public order policing has moved on a great deal from the arrangements in 1984, and tactics have now been reviewed and altered several times both by the police and the courts.</p> <p>Protections which were singularly lacking at the time of Orgreave now exist with the introduction in the mid-80s of the Police &amp; Criminal Evidence Act which has vastly improved the way police investigations and powers operate.</p> <p>The creation of the Crown Prosecution Service in 1986, with the introduction of independent CPS prosecutors, fundamentally altered the prosecution of offences. It ended the existence of ad hoc prosecution arrangements across the country whereby a mixture of police prosecutors and private firms of solicitors - hired by the police and acting for and on the instruction of the police \u2013 conducted prosecutions.</p> <p>With regards to the external scrutiny of complaints against the police, this was strengthened by the creation, in 1985, of the Police Complaints Authority which was replaced in 2004 by the more effective Independent Police Complaints Commission and in turn will be replaced by the Office for Police Conduct in 2017. The exemplary standards of behaviour expected of everyone who works in policing were reinforced by the introduction of a statutory Code of Ethics, laid before this House in 2014.</p> <p>Lastly, the introduction of directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners in 2012 has given the public a voice in shaping their local policing priorities and improved the accountability of police leadership.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She says she is not convinced that a proper investigation into Orgreave at the time would have prevented the Hillsborough tragedy.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The campaigners say that had the consequences of the events at Orgreave been addressed properly at the time, the tragic events at Hillsborough would never have happened five years later.

On a walk around Richmond town centre with the Lib Dem candidate, Sarah Olney<strong>,</strong> <strong> Nick Clegg</strong>, the latest big name brought in to boost the campaign, was keen to stress the temporary Ukip leader\u2019s support for Goldsmith to constituents who stopped to chat. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For all those people who were originally attracted to Zac Goldsmith as a modern, idealist, attractive, faintly glamorous ... minor royal, for those people, if you look back to his demeanour (when he was first elected), I think many people will be gobsmacked that he\u2019s now Nigel Farage\u2019s favoured candidate.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Lib Dems projected an aura of confidence about their chances with Olney declaring her chances of winning at 10/10. She said it could not be a referendum on Heathrow as there was no candidate in favour of a third runway while Clegg said Goldsmith had been unable to stop the government taking the Heathrow decision when a Tory so would be even less influential as an independent. He recalled:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All the hours and hours I spoke to David Cameron and George Osborne (about Heathrow)... Goldsmith\u2019s name never came up.

He was one of Nigel Farage\u2019s chief advisers in the run-up to the 2015 and was credited/blamed for encouraging Farage to adopt increasingly hard right positions, especially on immigration. When he announced his leadership bid he seemed an unlikely candidate, partly because of his age (30) but more because <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/ukip-leadership-frontrunner-raheem-kassam-nicola-sturgeon-twitter-apology_uk_5813943de4b0672ea688ddc0\">his Twitter feed is littered with offensive comments that make Donald Trump sound diplomatic, </a>but he campaigned energetically, and was good at generating publicity.

This was a very difficult decision, and I want to thank everyone who supported me in the process.</p> <p>It is a decision I have not taken lightly, but following meetings this weekend I realised the path to victory is too narrow. <strong>I would encourage my supporters to back Peter Whittle, who I think would make a fantastic leader of the party.</strong></p> <p>On their own, the following issues would not have caused me to take this decision, but taken together, the following reasons created an impossible route forward for me: </p> <p><strong>1. The top of the party is treating this like a coronation:</strong> I am not satisfied about the integrity of the process, and having put a number of complaints in to the party chairman, I was disappointed that incidents whereby Members of the European Parliament are using party databases to effectively campaign against me \u2013 ostensibly against the rules \u2013 were not challenged.</p> <p><strong>2. Disgraceful treatment by the media: </strong>I am tough and I can take it, but when<em>Times</em> journalists show up at my elderly parents\u2019 house at dusk, intimidating them, I draw the line. Billy Kenber at the <em>Times</em> has a lot to answer for and I will be pursuing a harassment complaint further.</p> <p><strong>3. Fundraising:</strong> While we raised enough for our deposit, and got over 200 assentors to my nomination, we could not raise enough for this to be more than a digital campaign run from SW1, and to not feature at events all around the country would have made me a hypocrite, given how much I criticise the establishment for ignoring the country.</p> <p>Over the next few weeks I will be providing a statement of accounts for all my donors, and in-keeping with my money pledge on my website, I will be giving them the choice as to what happens with the remainder of the money they donated. I will suggest we either: donate to the Royal British Legion or Help for Heroes, donate to the party, donate to Peter Whittle\u2019s campaign. Those who want refunds are welcome to contact me.</p> <p>I wish the UK Independence Party and whoever its new leader is all the best in ensuring Brexit happens, and in the upcoming electoral tests next year. I remain commited to the causes of the UK Independence Party, but sadly, at this campaign, it was a bridge too far for us.</p> <p>I will be continuing at my job as Editor in Chief of Breitbart London, returning to the United States this week to cover the last leg of the presidential elections.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T09:59:30.064Z\">at 9.59am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58171022e4b0219a00d3a8b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T09:36:25.031Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>NHS Providers,</strong> a group representing hospitals, has put out <a href=\"https://www.nhsproviders.org/news-blogs/news/time-has-come-for-a-new-financial-settlement-for-the-nhs-and-social-care\">a statement backing what the MPs from the health committee are saying. </a>This is from Chris Hopson, its chief executive.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We share the health committee\u2019s concerns that short term pressures, combined with cuts to public health, social care and capital funding, risk overwhelming the NHS\u2019 ability to provide the quality of care we all want when funding increases significantly tail off from 2017/18 onwards.

She told the programme.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, it\u2019s only technically correct if you\u2019re looking at spending on NHS England and you add an extra year to the spending review and you also take account of the switch from other budgets that we would normally think of as health spending. So, for example, you can only arrive at the \u00a310bn by shifting money from public health budgets and from health education and training, and also by changing the date at which you calculate real terms increases. So, yes, you can see how they have arrived at the figure. But the real figure we feel should be quoted at \u00a34.5bn which is considerably less ... That\u2019s over the period of the spending review and that\u2019s the period that we usually talk about increases in spending. We wouldn\u2019t normally, say for other government departments, just add an extra year.</p> </blockquote> <p>She also rejected the claim that Simon Stevens, NHS England\u2019s chief executive, has said that the government has given him what he wants. In fact, health spending is due to fall on a per head basis towards the end of this parliament, she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Stevens] was very clear when he came before our committee during our inquiry that if you look at the middle years, next year and the year after, we are going to be seeing a far more constrained situation, and certainly not what he asked for. So, certainly, for 2018-19 we will be seeing a per capita fall in funding for the NHS at a time when our demographics [are changing], the increase in older people, a 21% increase in the number of people over 65 in the last decade up to 2015.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is a clip from Wollaston\u2019s interview.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/792994381645148160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&#39;Government wrong on NHS spending&#39; - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarahwollaston\">@sarahwollaston</a> says actual figure \u00a34.5bn rather than \u00a310bn they have claimed <a href=\"https://t.co/BfALjw4bMg\">https://t.co/BfALjw4bMg</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/BVT6qNe3F2\">pic.twitter.com/BVT6qNe3F2</a></p>&mdash; BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/792994381645148160\">October 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>I will report more on this if the story moves on.</p> <p>Otherwise, it\u2019s a patchy day.

This implication is not confined to one instance, but rather is increasingly how Britain responds to any group in need: from foreign children begging for refuge to disabled people struggling without benefits.</p> <p>It showed itself back when the Conservatives <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9263502/Iain-Duncan-Smith-Im-not-scared-to-light-the-fuse-on-disability-reform.html\">began to roll out sweeping disability cuts</a> in 2012 as government ministers and the rightwing press combined faux concern for the \u201cvulnerable\u201d with the claim the welfare bill was riddled with fraud and abuse.

But when suspicion is the default setting, the goalposts are ever shifting. A teenager can meet the requirements necessary to be approved for refugee status by the British authorities, but one look at a photo and the Sun can declare he\u2019s \u201c35 if he\u2019s a day\u201d. A disabled person can be judged as eligible for social security for life only to be<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/we-cant-help-being-disabled-reassessment-hysteria-scroungers-cheating-system\"> retested and have it removed</a>.</p> <p>At its most manipulative, the genuine v fakes narrative can be deployed to stigmatise whole groups of individuals under the guise of trying to help them. Critics can not only introduce invasive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/16/fit-for-work-tests-serious-toll-mental-health-work-capability\">harmful fit-for-work testing</a> regimes out of apparent necessity but promote obscenely callous acts \u2013 be it leaving lone children to sleep outside or sanctioning disabled people\u2019s benefits \u2013 with the reassurance that they aren\u2019t, of course, talking about the genuine. On the contrary, it\u2019s all been done to ensure support goes to those who truly need it.</p> <p>In reality, this line of thinking not only suggests that the people who are not genuine \u2013 say, 19-year-old refugees \u2013 don\u2019t deserve help, it also creates a excuse to not help anyone at all. \u201cI\u2019d support a benefit system for real disabled people but all the scroungers make it impossible,\u201d goes the argument. Or \u201cI\u2019d obviously help a refugee child, but how can we if we can\u2019t tell who\u2019s actually a child?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/29/kindertransport-heros-daughter-urges-uk-to-welcome-calais-refugees\">Kindertransport hero\u2019s daughter urges UK to welcome Calais refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What it is doing fundamentally is setting us against each other, introducing a poisonous paranoia into daily discourse that says we should look with suspicion at anyone who asks for help. It starts to eradicate empathy, as it is based on the premise that compassion \u2013 here, a limited good \u2013 will be saved for the few real people in need, and society has no reason or duty to care about the rest.</p> <p>The consequence is that this country can now sit by comfortably as fellow human beings suffer. Crying refugee children, paraplegics, cancer patients. The first question becomes not \u201chow can I help?\u201d but \u201care they genuine?\u201d. It is not a coincidence that the people who are being abandoned happen to be the most vulnerable: those who in any other circumstance a so-called civilised society would be the first to give help to. But rather, it\u2019s a symptom of how rotten things have become. In the politics of the genuine, ultimately, no one is worthy of help.</p>",
  "<p>The 1973 film Westworld, directed and written by Michael Crichton, was a crude movie about crude machines staffing a depraved theme park. Crichton\u2019s pleasure robots were either sexy toasters or bad toasters. When they malfunctioned, the machines simply played out their protocols and killed all but one guest. Remember how infected web cams and smart fridges brought down a chunk of the Internet last week? That, but with bullets. HBO\u2019s serial television expansion of Westworld\u2019s Cowboy-Guignol is staffed with robots beyond the toaster stage, androids flirting with consciousness. Considering the violence in play, this isn\u2019t necessarily an improvement. If Westworld doesn\u2019t hit an unexpected fork in the plot soon, it could go down as a mild update of the bloodbath from Game of Thrones\u2019s first season. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/31/westworld-recap-episode-five-hold-on-to-your-hats-its-dolores-the-lawless\">Westworld recap: episode five \u2013 hold on to your hats! It's Dolores the lawless</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike Game of Thrones, Westworld can\u2019t make up its mind up about torture \u2013 never mind evil and good \u2013 and the show hasn\u2019t presented a villain as easily loathed as King Joffrey or a hero as obvious as Daenerys Targaryen. Robots becoming sentient is only interesting if those robots are worth saving, and Westworld will only gain our trust if the abuse of robots is dramatically and philosophically distinct from the suffering of actual humans.<br></p> <p>The twin suns of Westworld are in the logo. At base, the image is Da Vinci\u2019s Vitruvian Man, rebooted as the musculature of a half-finished android stretched on a circular frame. In the show\u2019s intro, these figures sink into vats of scientifically advanced milk, which turns them, somehow, into the lifelike hosts of the 21stcentury Westworld park. This protean figure is also a few fibers shy of the flayed red man on the House Bolton sigil from Game of Thrones. These are the forces holding Westworld in place: philosophical queries into selfhood and the bloody spectacle that underpins HBO\u2019s most popular product. </p> <p>The only compelling characters, so far, are robot hosts: Evan Rachel Wood as Dolores Abernathy, a rancher\u2019s daughter, and Thandie Newton as Maeve Millay, an olde tyme madame in a local saloon. Newton manages to seem more alive than the living, and Wood pulls off silent shifts in reflex that suggest a machine under the skin. To date, Dolores and Maeve have been raped, scalped and abused in unknown ways. (Only some violent bits are shown on-screen.) Here is where philosophy overlaps with crowd-pleasing. Game of Thrones built an audience on the bodies behind the Bolton sigil, characters raped, bisected, disemboweled, flayed, despined and castrated in the name of prestige television. But the disproportionate violence against women backfired, leading to a protest against the rape of Sansa Stark in season five. Westworld flirts with these levels of sadism, while giving itself a possible out. As Ford himself explains, as he casually slices an offline host with a scalpel: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get cold, doesn\u2019t feel ashamed. Doesn\u2019t feel a solitary thing that we haven\u2019t told it to.\u201d Can\u2019t get upset about hurting robots \u2013 right?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13cd8d1e35ddf8a130e293dd8f0c9f1fd29aa30b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13cd8d1e35ddf8a130e293dd8f0c9f1fd29aa30b/0_103_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Evil Dead: Iwan Rheon as Ramsay Bolton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Evil Dead: Iwan Rheon as Ramsay Bolton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 2016 Home Box Office, Inc. Al</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hosts are in a category scientists call \u201cWeak AI,\u201d where machines play out binary decisions to sophisticated levels of action without ever achieving the consciousness that allows for intentionality. On Westworld, the hosts are approaching \u201cSmart AI,\u201d where coding leads to consciousness. The Weak/Strong AI distinction is not minor. As Westworld begins, new lines of programming are causing host memories to multiply, even though the hosts go through a nightly memory erasure. This glitch is creating traumatic feedback loops for Maeve and Dolores \u2013 except, hang on, there is no trauma without consciousness. As Dr Ford \u2013 the park\u2019s creator and mastermind \u2013 has explicitly told us, his hosts are Weak AI. This squares with what is now possible, and what keeps Westworld in the realm of speculative fiction rather than fantasy. In place of the giants of rug and ice in Game of Thrones, Westworld presents a make-believe charnel for the 1% and derives frisson by not being inconceivable.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/30/westworld-wild-fan-theories-about-sci-fi-tv-series\">The \u2018truth\u2019 about Westworld: seven fan theories to blow your mind</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Which is where we go off the rails. What happens if your heroes aren\u2019t real and your villains aren\u2019t that villainous? The men and women creating or abusing the hosts haven\u2019t sunk any lower than bureaucratic creeps and black card frat boys. If Westworld asks for suspension of disbelief and allows hosts to be sentient, two potholes yawn wide open. First, the hosts will be, categorically, victims of ritual abuse, which is as sickening as anything on Game of Thrones. Second, if the hosts mount up and override the built-in safeguards that prevent them from hurting humans, will we care? Aside from the emo head of programming, Bernard Lowe (Jeffrey Wright), the staff are either ruthlessly ambitious or ambitiously narcissistic. Our god mode God, Dr Ford, is more detached than Bolton-level evil. We would miss approximately none of these people. This means that we are at least a season away from developing strong feelings about the actual humans, which is a long time in the age of generous binge-watching options.</p> <p>Wishing for violent retribution is an odd square to land on. Game of Thrones played fast and loose with sexual violence to bring in the gawkers, just to pull it back in season six and let the Stark women have their moment. In Westeros, the depraved eventually get their depravity back, at least. Westworld can\u2019t make up its mind about what should and shouldn\u2019t happen to bodies, or karma. Last night\u2019s episode featured a dogleg into an orgy with no narrative significance, and a repairman calling Maeve a \u201cfuck puppet\u201d.

Still, the Martin estate\u2019s refusal to include the works is tantamount to declaring them fake. </p> <p>The question of authentication, Polsky believes, is becoming a profound problem for the art world. \u201cArt has become such a commodity, and there\u2019s so much money at stake, that [if] a painting that belongs to you or as a dealer you may have sold is declared essentially worthless, you\u2019ll do anything to turn the decision around.\u201d </p> <p>The timing of the latest dispute to hit the headlines is significant. <a href=\"https://www.guggenheim.org/exhibition/agnes-martin\">A major retrospective of Martin\u2019s work recently opened at the Guggenheim</a> in New York and the value of her work has soared in recent years. </p> <p>According to the Mayor Gallery\u2019s complaint, it sold certain paintings to individual collectors in the belief (and representing) that the works were by the artist.

In each case, the committee apparently rejected works. Mayor claims the decisions were reached with an inadequate level of interest or responsiveness.</p> <p>The dispute comes on the heels of several recent clashes. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/arts/design/a-dubious-old-master-unnerves-the-art-world.html\">Earlier this month</a>, it was revealed that Sotheby\u2019s auction house sold Frans Hals\u2019s Portrait of Man for $10m in 2011, a work which rival Christie\u2019s had passed on because its experts were not satisfied with the provenance and attribution. The painting has since been declared a fake and a refund issued to the buyer.</p> <p>In September, the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/13/alec-baldwin-sues-art-dealer-over-190000-painting\">Alec Baldwin sued New York dealer Mary Boone </a>after he was sold a Ross Bleckner painting, Sea and Mirror, under the impression, he claims, it was a work he had first seen and admired in 1996. Baldwin said something about the $190,000 work made him uneasy. Besides, it smelled new \u2013 and the actor says that in fact, the painting was a version made in 2010. The dispute is now headed to court. </p> <p>Earlier in the year, in an epic case, the former Gucci CEO Domenico de Soles sued the world-famous but now defunct Knoedler Gallery, <a href=\"http://www.artnews.com/2016/01/28/domenico-de-sole-who-paid-8-3-m-for-fake-rothko-takes-the-stand-in-knoedler-trial/\">for selling him a fake Mark Rothko painting for $8.3m</a>. That was settled out of court after it became clear that Knoedler had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/apr/22/forged-art-scandal-new-york-artist-china-spain\">been selling dozens of abstract expressionist \u201cmasters\u201d created by a Chinese artist in the New York borough of Queens</a>.</p> <p>In that case, several experts had authenticated the painting, despite the fact that in something of a giveaway, the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/feb/02/fake-rothko-trial-reduces-tragic-art-to-farce\">Knoedler Gallery director, Anne Kennedy</a>, had hung a Jackson Pollock in her office that was not only signed on the front (something the artist never did) but also had the artist\u2019s name spelled \u201cPollok\u201d.</p> <p>An expert called to testify at the trial explained that without provenance, authenticating art would be a little like watching Elvis Presley against several Presley imitators \u2013 one intuitively knows which is real and which is fake. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/13/alec-baldwin-sues-art-dealer-over-190000-painting\">Alec Baldwin sues art dealer over $190,000 'original' that wasn't</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the problems posed by authentication are only likely to get worse, warns Polsky. Over the past several years, estate boards that once authenticated works by Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat and the pop master Roy Liechtenstein have shut up shop. </p> <p>The move came after the Warhol Foundation spent a reputed $7m defending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/18/artnews.art\">its decision to deny the authenticity of a self-portrait owned by the UK collector Joe Simon</a>. Not only did the Warhol Foundation refuse to authenticate the work, but it stamped \u201cdenied\u201d on the back, rendering the painting \u2013 considered by others to be genuine \u2013 virtually worthless. </p> <p> But with the approach of the November sales, new questions of authenticity are unlikely to bring to cheer to an art market that has already seen sales volume decline since peaking in 2014. </p> <p>Part of the problem, Polsky believes, is a lack of industry standards. \u201cEvery authentication board is different and every catalogue raisonn\u00e9e is different. People may not like it if you turn something down, but if at least if you\u2019re open and honest with people about why, they probably won\u2019t sue you or feel that you\u2019ve been treated unfairly.\u201d</p>",

It turned out he\u2019d spoken to Ghana team-mate Wakaso Mubarak, at Las Palmas last season, and Wakaso told him that Seti\u00e9n was a bit special, a manager who liked to play. That sounded good to him. </p> <p>Jes\u00fas Gil once accused Seti\u00e9n of hanging around with \u201costentatious\u201d women, which was a bit rich coming from the man whose TV show featured him, a gelatinous blob in a jacuzzi, surrounded by women in bikinis, and which was just as excuse to get rid of a midfielder who dared say what everyone else thought. Quique spoke, alright; he also listened, when it was worth listening to: Luis Aragon\u00e9s was forever shouting at him and he was forever grateful. But he went his own way, knew his own mind. A midfielder who was different and a manager who\u2019s something else, he later admitted one or two might have been ostentatious, yes. But if it\u2019s really ostentatious you\u2019re after, try his team. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9336e367c46c2f19ce6be50685c151a1e850a722\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9336e367c46c2f19ce6be50685c151a1e850a722/0_75_1512_906/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Las Palmas\u2019 coach Quique Setien gestures from the sideline.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Las Palmas\u2019 coach Quique Setien gestures from the sideline.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jose Jordan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A purist and a preacher man, at Las Palmas Seti\u00e9n has found his kind of place and his kind of club; \u201cthe kind of place where they understand me, and that\u2019s not easy.\u201d The clich\u00e9 talks of the Canaries \u2013 dry hot, land of beaches \u2013 as a kind of Spanish Brazil: a place where football is more fantasy and finesse than fitness. And watching Las Palmas is just like watching Brazil. When Brazil were good. The ball is usually theirs and the football is usually fun. This season started continuing the trend set last season. They got four against Valencia, five against Granada, and when they turned up at the S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n in week three, their flag flew in first place on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/774658733691564032\">the roof-top league table</a>.</p> <p>The next day it was taken down and it hasn\u2019t gone back up. They lost 2-1 to Sevilla and although they beat M\u00e1laga 1-0 the following week, Las Palmas haven\u2019t won since. Six weeks have passed. Knocked off the top, where no one expected them to stay, that day Seti\u00e9n was asked: \u201cwhat now?\u201d \u201cOur target has to be survival,\u201d he said, \u201cbut then we\u2019ll see if we can do anything beyond that, if we can be comfortable enough to play some nice games for our fans to enjoy.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/31/newcastle-united-rafa-benitez-promotion-extremadura-tenerife-championship\">Rafa Ben\u00edtez's record as a promotion specialist bodes well for Newcastle fans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They\u2019ve done that. Even when they stopped winning, which they did swiftly, it was well worth watching. There were 2-2 draws with Osasuna and Real Madrid. If they were a little fortunate then, against Sevilla they were superb for an hour but lost to a goal in the 89<sup>th</sup>minute \u2013 a questionable penalty \u2013 and another in the 94<sup>th</sup>. At Villarreal last week they scored the most beautiful goal you could wish to see, 18 passes from one end to the other ending with a lovely dinked ball, a lovelier volleyed backheel assist, and an even lovelier volleyed finish, Prince leaping to guide it in, a metre and a half off the floor. Only to be defeated by a 92<sup>nd</sup> minute goal, having conceded another questionable penalty. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time. And I\u2019d like to know, if it was the other way around, whether the referee would have the balls to give it?\u201d Seti\u00e9n said.</p> <p>And so it came to this. Las Palmas versus Celta. Even in <em>boring, predictable</em> Spain where things that only happen in the Premier League seem to happen quite a lot, where there are goals every week, this promised to be pretty good. AS said it was a \u201cballroom\u201d game in which the teams would wear tuxedos \u2013 which sounds ridiculous and, <a href=\"http://media.foxdeportes.com/photos/cache/640x360/photos/2014/08/01/53dbeb57241bf.jpeg\">as Cultural Leonesa proved</a>, looks ridiculous too. \u201cIt will be an aesthetic show,\u201d they said. Goals guaranteed. Las Palmas\u2019s results, after all, included a 5-1, two 2-2s, a 1-4 and a 2-4. As for Celta, their last three games read: 4-3, 0-5, 4-1. And if Las Palmas are very much Seti\u00e9n\u2019s side, Celta\u2019s are just as much Berizzo\u2019s.</p> <p> \u201cWe\u2019re two teams who look forwards instead of backwards,\u201d Seti\u00e9n said. Berrizzo insisted: \u201cLas Palmas are a good team\u201d. So, Seti\u00e9n responded, are Celta. Two good teams; two goalkeepers who, truth be told, contributed too. \u201cIt will be a nice game,\u201d Seti\u00e9n promised. </p> <p> It was better even than that. The kind of game where, as one Canary Island daily put it: \u201cYou want to kill them, but you can\u2019t help but love them too.\u201d The kind of game that that closed with socks down by ankles and cramp creeping up claves, ball flying from one end to the other, and left you wishing there could be extra time. The kind of game where it wasn\u2019t just the players who were exhausted but the fans too, a match of \u201cfaith and madness\u201d as one headline had it, \u201ctotal madness\u201d another said, and which was nicely summed up in Momo\u2019s face, a grin stretching across it just after he ran on. <em>So, it really is a wild in here as it looked from out there.</em></p> <p>\u201cWe had the ball, which is what we like,\u201d Seti\u00e9n said, but they did not have the goals. At half time, the stat read: 73%-27% in possession, 384 attempted passes to 157 (just 65 of them completed for the visitors) and 0-3. Three chances, three goals. \u201cThey went one on one with us all over the pitch,\u201d Las Palmas striker Jonathan Viera admitted, and it worked: Tucu Hern\u00e1ndez on him, Daniel Wass on Roque Mesa, Nemanja Radoja on Vicente G\u00f3mez. Rob and run: fast, direct, aggressive. From either side, Pione Sisto and Fabi\u00e1n Orellana tore into Las Palmas every chance they got, which was often. In twenty-five minutes, Celta scored three times, Wass hitting a free kick through the wall and Iago Aspas twice lifting over the keeper \u2013 that\u2019s six in six for him now. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/31/newcastle-united-rafa-benitez-promotion-extremadura-tenerife-championship\">Rafa Ben\u00edtez's record as a promotion specialist bodes well for Newcastle fans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Las Palmas hadn\u2019t won in five, but it wasn\u2019t over. They were still playing, still passing, still attacking, only quicker now. And as long as it took them to lose it, they got it back again: three goals in sixteen second half minutes. The first a penalty, sure but beautifully made. The second a header from Pedro Bigas. The third, built on the right and finished by Prince, diving in, the comeback completed.</p> <p>Yet still it wasn\u2019t over. Between the first and the second, Celta had hit the post. It had gone from 0-3 to 3-3 but it wasn\u2019t all one way and from there it could have gone to 4-3 or 3-4 or 4-4. A graphic in AS marks the shots on goal with a minute-by-minute bar chart: this game\u2019s graphic was the Manhattan skyline. \u201cThe result was reward for their intentions,\u201d Berizzo said. \u201cAnd yet we almost won it too.\u201d In the 91<sup>st</sup>minute, Marcelo D\u00edaz Celta hit the bar, another collective coronary. A moment later, the whistle went, Aspas gave up his shirt and the fans gave it up for the players, smiles on their faces.</p> <p>\u201cThis tastes like glory,\u201d Viera insisted; Berizzo reckoned it tasted \u201cbitter-sweet\u201d. \u201cWe foresaw a mad game, because they always make things happen,\u201d Seti\u00e9n said. \u201cThe game went mad,\u201d Berizzo said. As for everyone else, there wasn\u2019t much that could be said, except: thanks.</p> <h2><strong>Results and talking points</strong></h2> <p>Legan\u00e9s 0\u20132 Real Sociedad, Sporting 1\u20131 Sevilla, Alav\u00e9s 1\u20134 Real Madrid, Atl\u00e9tico 4-2 M\u00e1laga, Barcelona 1\u20130 Granada, Eibar 2\u20131 Villarreal, Athletic 1\u20131 Osasuna, Betis 0\u20131 Espanyol, Las Palmas 3\u20133 Celta Deportivo-Valencia.</p> <ul> <li>Barcelona beat Granada 1-0. And, erm, that\u2019s about it.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Black shoes, black suit, black tie. Diego Simeone was back in black \u2026 and Atl\u00e9tico were back winning again. Coincidence? Maybe. Or maybe not. Another day at the Calder\u00f3n, another four goals for the team that are more attacking than ever before, two each for Kevin Gameiro and Yannick Carrasco. Not that Simeone necessarily saw it like that. Asked what he made of the fact that some people say that <em>now</em> they\u2019re an attacking team, that <em>now</em> the score goals, the Atletico manager replied: \u201cI laugh.\u201d</li> </ul> <ul> <li>On Thursday night, one TV channel asked whether Ronaldo was past it. On Saturday afternoon, he scored a hat-trick. Of course.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The ridiculous thing was not that the referee gave the penalty to Madrid for the handball(?) from Deyverson, nor would have been that he didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t that some thought it was a penalty and some thought it wasn\u2019t. It was that some claimed it was \u2018clear\u2019, either way. And that you knew beforehand exactly who would say what.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Friday night is cinema night, and Legan\u00e9s provided the popcorn \u2013 free for fans at the gate. At least they were fed as they were fed up. They were beaten 2-0 by Real Sociedad, leaving Butarque waiting for its first ever win in <em>primera</em>.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>\u201cKeep off the grass.\u201d There is a patch of grass at the Villarreal training pitch, just by the corner, where no one was allowed to tread as they prepared to travel to Eibar. After all, that space does not exist at Ipurua, they were told. And so it was that on Thursday they practiced corners without a run-up, Samu Castillejo turning to one team-mate to say \u201cno, mate, that\u2019s a wall \u2026 and those are cameramen and photographers,\u201d as he took a step back onto the astroturf beyond. The first time they got a corner in the match, it was exactly as they had planned it in training too, played short and played back again, but ultimately it didn\u2019t help much. That corner came to nothing and although Villarreal went 1-0 up, Bruno hopping to score a penalty, Eibar came back to win 2-1, the second scored by Pedro Leon with four minutes to go \u2013 and on the eleventh anniversary of his brother\u2019s death. It was Villarreal\u2019s first defeat in twelve games. \u201cThat can happen in football; we can\u2019t lose hope,\u201d Fran Escrib\u00e1 said, quite rightly.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>\u201cPoyet, come out your cave!\u201d chanted the Betis fans, but Gus wasn\u2019t moving off the bench. He later explained that he didn\u2019t want to take the attention from the players but most fans thought that he just didn\u2019t want to face them on the night they lost to Espanyol, thanks not least to an astonishing late save from Diego L\u00f3pez. So they carried on chanting: \u201cPoyet, go now!\u201d. \u201cThe fans are free to chant what they like but please don\u2019t keep asking me about it every week or we\u2019ll still be here in June,\u201d Poyet said afterwards. Well, they will be anyway. Whether he makes it that far looks like a very different matter.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-table\"

To the response of \u201cfewer\u201d, Wilders replied: \u201cWell, we\u2019ll take care of that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/demagogues-and-cheats-un-human-rights-chief-condemns-trump-and-wilders\">'Demagogues and cheats': UN rights chief condemns Trump and Wilders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than 6,000 people filed official complaints to the police about Wilders\u2019 comments and, nine months later, he was formally charged with racial discrimination and inciting hatred. The maximum sentence is two years in prison, although fines and community service orders are more common.</p> <p>On Monday in court, the panel of judges watched video footage of the speech and read out a list of questions that they wanted to put to the PVV leader, such as \u201cWhat did you intend to gain?\u201d </p> <p>A sample of the 6,474 police complaints was read out in court, with some people saying they had felt \u201csick\u201d, \u201cangry\u201d and \u201ctreated like pariahs\u201d by Wilders\u2019 statements.</p> <p>Judge Hendrik Steenhuis said he had no doubt Wilders would be following the live coverage of the trial and suggested he could reply via Twitter. </p> <p>Prosecutor Wouter Bos expressed his frustration at Wilders\u2019 decision not to attend. \u201cIt would have been courteous of him if we had heard his views via the defence rather than in the newspaper,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Wilders announced his intention to boycott the trial on Friday in a column for the AD newspaper in which he claimed he spoke for \u201cmillions of Dutch people, fed up with the disruption and terror caused by so many Moroccans \u2026 If talking about that is an offence, the Netherlands is no longer a free country, but a dictatorship\u201d.</p> <p>Wilders\u2019s lawyer Geert-Jan Knoops said his client\u2019s decision was \u201cnot sensible\u201d, but consistent with his view of the proceedings against him.</p> <p>The prosecution is expected to submit its sentencing demands on 16 November.</p> <p>Wilders has been the frontrunner for the Netherlands\u2019 parliamentary elections next March for about a year, but the latest opinion polls show him running either neck and neck or just behind the Liberals (VVD) of the prime minister, Mark Rutte, with about 18% of the vote in the highly fragmented Dutch landscape.</p> <p>His shrinking lead has coincided with a steep drop in the number of refugees arriving in the Netherlands since last year when plans to build new centres for asylum seekers led to riots outside town halls.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Wilders has hardened his anti-Islam, anti-EU stance for the election campaign. His party\u2019s draft manifesto includes pledges to shut every mosque \u2013 previously he merely opposed building new ones. It also calls for a ban on the Qur\u2019an and headscarves from government buildings, the tearing up of the Schengen open borders agreement and a \u201cNexit\u201d referendum to follow the UK out of the European Union.</p> <p>Under the Dutch proportional representation system, the leader of the largest party is conventionally given the first shot at forming a government. But these are unconventional times; most other parties have ruled out a coalition with Wilders and, if the district court in The Hague finds him guilty, voters will have to decide whether to endorse a convicted criminal as their prime minister.<br></p> <p>It is not the first time that Wilders\u2019 public statements have landed him in court. In 2011, he was acquitted of discriminating against, and inciting hatred towards, Muslims in interviews in which he denounced Islam as a \u201cfascist\u201d religion. But the case is stronger this time because his comments were directed against a racial group, according to Henny Sackers, professor of administrative criminal law at Radboud University in Nijmegen.</p> <p>\u201cThe European court says you can criticise religion in public even if it shocks, hurts or disturbs,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the case of discrimination on grounds of nationality, you can be guilty of an offence in Dutch law if you provoke social unrest. So I see the chances of a conviction for Wilders as being considerably higher than three years ago.</p> <p>\u201cThose who know our constitutional law say this trial has come at a very unfortunate time for democracy. Whether Wilders is acquitted or convicted, he will present himself as the Dutch Donald Trump, a crusader for the free world. It will always give him a potential electoral advantage.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>One of the most significant moments in my life came one afternoon about five months ago, when I was volunteering in an elephant sanctuary in Thailand. I was tidying the park as part of my duties when I came across a beautiful, solitary elephant with a badly deformed front leg. Concerned as to why she was alone and curious about her physical health, I asked a guide.</p> <p>Kabu was 26 years old, like me. She had been rescued about a year before but sadly never settled with a herd. She had been used for the illegal logging trade since infancy, pulling huge weights up and down steep mountain ravines. During one of these tortuous journeys, a log came loose, rolled into her and badly broke her leg. Forced to continue working, her injury never healed. When Kabu was finally rescued she was weak and traumatised.

This gave me a sense of safety and security, so I pressed against her further as if to hug her.

Perhaps<a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/7140/0\" rel=\"nofollow\"> just 50,000 are left</a>. In Thailand there are about 6,000, half of which live in captivity. The ancient tradition of capture and domestication not only raises welfare problems, it is also a strain on the dwindling wild stock. On top of this many, some Asian elephants are subjected to a centuries-old domestication ritual known as \u201cthe crush\u201d, which breaks the spirit of a baby elephant to make it submit to human control.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Here was an animal who had gone through unspeakable horrors, yet was still willing to trust a human</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/04/thai-elephant-attack-spotlight-abuses-animal-tourism\">Animal rights groups report</a> that some elephants in the south-east Asian tourism industry \u2013 whether being used for riding or appearing to calmly paint pictures in the street \u2013 have gone through some form of the crush. In the most extreme examples of the crush wild calves are separated from their mothers and tied in a pen so constrictive it cannot move or lie down. This treatment may last for several weeks, and observers describe cases where food, water and sleep are restricted, and injuries are inflicted on the animals.</p> <p>Elephants are highly sentient, evolved animals, who form lifelong relationships with their families. Anyone who has spent any time with these beautiful creatures cannot doubt their sensitivity and intelligence, and the risk of lifelong damage from treatment such as the crush. Some elephants become withdrawn or behave aggressively towards humans \u2013 both examples of how psychological damage can be manifested.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/jun/14/elephants-soothed-with-lullabies-in-thailand-sanctuary-video-report\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4y5dk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2543123\"            data-video-name=\"Elephants soothed with lullabies in Thailand sanctuary \u2013\u00a0video report\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57606706e4b005ab05d2100f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11596099&amp;format=video/mp4\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/06/14/160614elephantlullaby_large.3gp\"> <source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11596099&amp;format=video/webm\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/06/14/160614elephantlullaby_small.3gp\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/06/14/160614elephantlullaby.m3u8\"> </video> <figcaption>Sangduen \u2018Lek\u2019 Chailert, the founder of Chiang Mai\u2019s Elephant Nature Park, sings lullabies to the elephants in her care.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The ethos of the ENP sanctuary, surrounded by rainforest and rivers, is for rescued elephants to roam completely free, for them never to work and to live out their lives in peace, happiness and fun. They form new family bonds, and some even have calves. While it is still visible how much pain and suffering these animals have endured \u2013 some are blind and others are too emotionally unpredictable to interact with humans \u2013 most of the elephants are relaxed and enjoy their freedom. ENP largely raises money through sponsorship and tourism. Visitors can stay for one day, or volunteer for up to two weeks (as I did).</p> <p>And how had I ended up here? A few months earlier I had been sitting in therapy, wrestling with conflicting urges to harm myself or to help myself. After experiences of abuse in my childhood, I began self-harming before I was 13. At this particular moment I was wrestling with hallucinations and beliefs that by hurting myself the disturbing images would go away. This time, however, I realised there could be another solution. I needed to do something life-changing, something that would take me out of my own head and into the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Anyone who has spent any time with these beautiful creatures cannot doubt their sensitivity and intelligence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I didn\u2019t initially know where to go. But after some research I found the Elephant Nature Park. Being a vegan and animal advocate, I felt it had the right ethos. While both my therapist and my wife were encouraging, they did have some concerns. Would I be well enough to travel far away? Would I be able to stay safe if I encountered anything that triggered urges to self-harm? What if being in such an environment were disheartening as opposed to inspirational, as I hoped? Although I was giddy with excitement about my grand adventure, I had to admit that these were concerns I shared.</p> <p>It took an overnight train ride from Bangkok to reach Chiang Mai province in northern Thailand, near the border with Burma. On the first day, everyone met at the ENP office in Chiang Mai city centre for registration and transport to the sanctuary itself. Our minivans were equipped with DVDs about how not to get trodden on by an elephant, something which had fleetingly crossed my mind before but was now crystallised as a legitimate possibility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b88e9d2e66fb4e9eda76f55bb30ff327b61319e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b88e9d2e66fb4e9eda76f55bb30ff327b61319e8/0_134_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Asian elephant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Elephants are highly sentient, evolved animals, who form lifelong relationships with their families.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Upon arrival, 50 or so excitable individuals waited to be paired up with roommates and organised into our volunteering groups. They were a lovely group of various ages from all over the world. </p> <p>Our first task was unloading the watermelon truck and filling up the \u201celephant kitchen\u201d. We each got into single file, passing along watermelons from the van to the many giant shelves that housed the elephant food. I was hit with the heady aroma of sweet fruit, and willed my body to adapt to the heat while shifting the heavy loads.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/12/why-the-guardian-is-spending-a-year-reporting-on-the-plight-of-the-worlds-elephant-population\">Why the Guardian is spending a year reporting on the plight of elephants</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My first elephant encounter was in fact rather unexpected; a sneaky trunk peeking around from the back of the kitchen, curious to identify any chopped up pieces of fruit ready for eating. I instantly knew that this was going to be a wonderful fortnight.</p> <p>The volunteering itself focuses on providing care for the elephants such as bathing, food preparation (I have seen enough watermelons to last a lifetime), and accompanying them to the vets. Volunteers also look after the park; scooping poop (there is a proper technique to this; shovel from the back of the pile, lift up from the centre) tidying shelters and planting trees. </p> <p>All of us as volunteers were incredibly touched to have the opportunity to stay here and look after the elephants. My group of new friends and I would come together each meal time with new stories and experiences to share, and certain times of day became graced with new importance: 3pm, time to help bathe the elephants; 4pm, feeding time opposite our own dinner table. It would be unrealistic to say that I did not experience intrusive thoughts or that my hallucinations stopped outright, but I felt no need to act upon them, and my happiness far outweighed any negative emotions. The routine and the socialising was important, but the fact that I was helping these amazing creatures was by far the most important factor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/indian-zip/giv-310757P5ysgFlayR1/\" data-alt=\"Range of Asian elephants\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/indian-zip/giv-310757P5ysgFlayR1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Range of Asian elephants</a> </figure>  <p>I think being in such an environment was therapeutic for all. There is a wealth of anecdotal evidence that animal assisted therapy can have a real impact on the social and psychological wellbeing of those struggling from both physical and psychological problems. I have a degree in psychology, and being here highlighted to me that there is a need for more formal studies to be conducted to build up the evidence base.</p> <p>I have returned from ENP with a renewed sense of wanting to face and survive my own pain, actively working towards giving up self-harm. Although I have had challenging moments, I have not self-harmed once since coming back and I am approaching a year free of self-harm altogether. Kabu continues to be a source of inspiration. If an elephant can go through the crush and survive forced labour without giving up hope and trust, then there is no reason why I cannot overcome my own trauma.</p> <p><em>Jake Dorothy lives in Cardiff, United Kingdom, with his wife and rescue cat.

  "<p>Obviously it\u2019s not a competition, but cities are winning. Every year, more people move to cities and they generate more of the world\u2019s prosperity. And as a result, they\u2019ve become wildly unpopular in some quarters.</p> <p>Conservative politicians in the US jeer at \u201cNew York values\u201d, while the \u201cmetropolitan elite\u201d are now held responsible for all of Britain\u2019s failings. A bogus moral superiority, fixation with cultural authenticity and a stifling national identity have become the abiding principles for all those who look on at the world\u2019s economic and creative powerhouses with resentment and baffled fury.</p> <p>But this is nonsense. New York values, just like those of other world cities, are the values of optimism, diversity and tenacity we should all aspire to, and cities at their best are an expression of humans at their best. Here are just 10 of the many reasons why \u2026</p> <p><strong>1 For their tolerance.</strong> A source of enduring comfort about humans is that the more often different peoples and cultures bump up against one another, the more they end up liking one another. In the year of Brexit and Trump, we should remind ourselves that the racism and bigotry that infects so much of national politics largely melts away at the city level. Cities have prospered because in them people get on together and overcome their hang-ups about ethnicity, faith, gender and sexuality. Of course, cities have social problems, income inequality and cultural fault lines, but whatever the outcome of the presidential election, America\u2019s metropolitan areas will firmly reject Trump, just as the UK\u2019s large cities rejected Brexit.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4364392ac1916bb02ef7fb538504c278b0174a66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4364392ac1916bb02ef7fb538504c278b0174a66/0_0_2992_1972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Participants staged a die-in outside Trump Tower in memory of all the lives taken by homophobia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Participants staged a die-in outside Trump Tower in memory of all the lives taken by homophobia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SIPA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>2 Because they are well regulated \u2026</strong> Cities pioneered planning and the social and economic rules of conduct that make civilisation possible. Ever since the first great cities of antiquity, urban administrators have had to devise policies for them to function, and these have expanded as cities have grown in size and complexity. As a consequence, cities today are managed through a web of regulations, restrictions, prohibitions and directives. Largely impenetrable and often infuriating, it is these rules that allow millions of us to live together in such harmony.<br></p> <p><strong>3 \u2026 although also a little bit lawless.</strong> The Dark Web might now be a thing, but city centres are still the place to go for recreational drugs, sexual misadventures, open-all-hours drinking dens, street food which doesn\u2019t conform to health standards, and nightclubs which breach acceptable noise guidelines.<br></p> <p><strong>4 Because you get to interact with nature.</strong> Barely anyone who lives in the countryside ever actually experiences the countryside. Industrial agriculture means that fields are now fenced off, drenched in pesticide and viewed as a blur from the motorway. In cities, however, people flock to public parks and nature reserves, visit botanical gardens, swim in ponds and take riverside walks, or simply buy fresh produce from farmers\u2019 markets. Not many cities can match Vienna, which has a whopping <a href=\"http://citiscope.org/story/2016/vienna-ranks-high-almost-every-urban-quality-life-list-heres-why\">120 square metres of green space per resident</a>, but even in New York there are <a href=\"http://www.milliontreesnyc.org/html/about/urban_forest_facts.shtml\">5 million trees</a>. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"60756b8de2650eaedcb454527da077e005138619\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60756b8de2650eaedcb454527da077e005138619/0_478_7360_4415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vienna, 120 metres of green space per capita.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vienna has 120 square metres of green space per capita.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>5 Because immigrants live in them.</strong> Cities have always attracted the planet\u2019s brightest and best, in other words: immigrants. Despite the endless studies showing this; despite all of <a href=\"http://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Immigrants-and-Nobel-Prizes.NFAP-Policy-Brief.October-2016.pdf\">America\u2019s 2016 Nobel Prize winners</a> (with the honourable exception of Bob Dylan) being immigrants, national politicians have become increasingly hysterical on the issue. But the world\u2019s leading cities are going the other way. The British government wishes to audit foreign workers, but London is openly welcoming them; Donald Trump wants to build a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/31/trump-mexico-border-wall-video\">wall across the Mexican border</a>, but just two hours away in Los Angeles, <a href=\"http://time.com/3678320/antonio-villaraigosa-senate/\">Antonio Villaraigosa</a>, the son of a Mexican immigrant, recently completed two terms as its mayor.</p> <p><strong>6 Because all the artists live there.</strong> In Plato\u2019s ideal city, there would be <a href=\"http://www.iep.utm.edu/republic/\">no artists or poets</a>. Happily, every single city since then, with the possible exception of John Calvin\u2019s Geneva, has ignored this advice. From the impressionists in 1870s Paris to the abstract expressionists of 1950s New York and <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/y/young-british-artists\">Young British Artists</a> of 1990s London, it is cities where all the great art scenes have flourished. And where there are art scenes, there is also innovation, new ideas, a successful night time economy and a glimpse of the future. To live in a city of artists is to live in the world\u2019s cockpit.<br></p> <p><strong>7 Because cities make you healthier.</strong> No one should ignore issues of air quality and inequality, but the fact remains that people in cities live healthier lives. They often walk and cycle to work, get out more and have <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304793504576434442652581806\">lower levels of obesity</a> than those in the countryside. In many parts of the world, they also have access to good hospitals and the very best (usually immigrant) health care professionals. All of this means that <a href=\"http://www.medicaldaily.com/life-expectancy-gap-between-city-and-country-folk-widens-how-access-health-care-plays-part-267929\">life expectancy in cities is higher than rural areas</a> \u2013 and the latest research from the US suggests that the gap is widening.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41f8a4676a632ef60f2c9012d95af13ca0202399\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41f8a4676a632ef60f2c9012d95af13ca0202399/0_183_3908_2346/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abstract expressionist painter Jackson Pollock moves one of his paintings in his studio, known as \u2018The Springs\u2019, in East Hampton, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abstract expressionist painter Jackson Pollock in his New York studio. Great art scenes flourish in cities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Vaccaro/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>8 Because cities forge great institutions.</strong> National governments struggle to create them, while commercial interests often destroy them. But it is cities that actually make the institutions that form the bedrock of our heritage, culture and public life. The world\u2019s great museums, universities, galleries and libraries are not just found in cities \u2013 they were founded by them. Through citizens subscriptions, local philanthropy and municipal foresight, the treasures of the world are collected, studied, conserved and made available for everyone to enjoy.<br></p> <p><strong>9 Because of their strong communities.</strong> Cities are often associated with anonymity but they are better characterised by their strong sense of community. It is in cities \u2013 particularly European ones with narrow roads, public spaces, local schools and high-density housing \u2013 that people come together. By contrast, the modern countryside can be deeply isolating; a place where people drive their children to school, shop in retail parks and spend their evenings watching satellite television. If the world really is undergoing an epidemic of loneliness, then the cure will be found in cities.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/31/why-i-hate-living-in-cities-dirty-dull-no-free-toilets\">Dirty, dull \u2013 and hardly any free toilets. Why I hate living in cities</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>10 For their generosity.</strong> Across the world, people who live in cities give huge amounts of money to people who don\u2019t. In the UK, London makes up 14% of the national population and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/07/london-top-taxpaying-city-uk-report\">almost 30% of its tax base</a>, with Londoners thought to be making a net contribution to the Treasury of approximately \u00a32,000 a year. What\u2019s amazing about this is that the response of rural populations is to heap scorn on metropolitan liberals, inflict reactionary governments on them, and vote to destroy their economic wellbeing. And yet, cities still continue to subsidise farms, finance national infrastructure and pay for public services. If cities are judged not just for what they do for their citizens but what they do for everybody, then surely it is all of us who should love them.<br></p> <p><em>Tom Campbell is the author of <a href=\"http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-planner-9781408818268/\">The Planner</a>, published by Bloomsbury Circus. </em><em>To order this novel for \u00a310.39 (RRP \u00a312.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/planner.html\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a></em></p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and join the discussion</em></p>",
  "<p>Ooh aah indeed. What an extraordinary Fright Night for Strictly. Judge Rinder as an insane moth doing the paso doble. Batastacia battling for her life. And Ed Balls as the mad scientist who cannot dance to save his life \u2013 and yet, miraculously, can somehow go like the clappers when he feels like it, moving in time and on time without stepping on his partner\u2019s feet, unlike (this week) Danny Mac. Say what you like, the former Chancellor has guts.</p> <p>There were some bizarre music choices, though. Evanescence\u2019s Bring Me Back to Life as a rumba? Meatloaf\u2019s Bat Out of Hell as a jive? Pro dancers must have their jaws on the floor when they hear these choices. Their task is frequently impossible and I take my Oksana tribute butterfly wig off to them for the work they do. (As I understand it, the producers choose the music, not the pro dancers. Or there\u2019s a nebulous consultation between the two. Either way, it does feel as if you can draw the short straw, music-wise, and through no fault of your own.) </p> <p>Now, though, what matters is that the competition is really starting. Some of the dancers are flagging physically (who can blame them). But worse, the psychology of the thing is kicking in. Ore and Danny both lost their nerve a little this week. Oti, Danny\u2019s partner, was right to take a risk with the \u201celastic band\u201d manoeuvre, but unfortunately it didn\u2019t pay off.

His morale seems to go from strength to strength: he really is a true politician, blundering on no matter who he\u2019s up against. You\u2019ve got to admire that. I suspect, though, that if anyone other than Daisy or Anastacia had been in the dance-off the backlash against Balls would have started. It\u2019s coming soon.</p> <h2>Darcey: woman of a thousand hairstyles</h2> <p>The blonde wig was truly scary. But it was the only terrifying thing about Darcey this weekend. It can feel as if she is forced to take the maternal role, and tones down her comments to buoy up contestants who might otherwise go postal over Craig\u2019s barbs. I\u2019d like to hear what she really thinks. She was generous and encouraging to both Anastacia and Daisy, which was perhaps a premonition.

It\u2019s hard not to get flashbacks of him doing a Dracula on Darcey and enjoying it rather too much in Saturday\u2019s opening number. Bruno\u2019s script this year is hilarious, as are his frequent deviations from it. On Louise and Kevin: \u201cYou don\u2019t see that at the Tate Modern, but you do see it on Strictly!\u201d This was a dance that bore very little relevance to contemporary art, other than a random Lichtenstein backdrop. But bless him for playing along. Also this classic to Greg and Natalie: \u201cHeathcliff and Cathy reunited on Wuthering Height!\u201d (sic) Love Bruno.

Classic Craig on Ed Balls: \u201cThat bottom was moving spasmodically. I\u2019ve never seen anything so bizarre in my life.\u201d He awarded a 4 to Bruno\u2019s 8, giving an indication of where this might be going next week: highly polarised scoring in the run-up to Blackpool. <br></p> <h2>This week\u2019s verdict</h2> <p>Laura upped her game impressively, but she is clearly in pain from her ankle injury and could barely get up the stairs to Claudia after her dance. Natalie Lowe must be stressed. Her decision to ignore the rumba brief and go for a crowd-pleasing dance kept them in the show, though. She\u2019d be wise to continue playing to Greg\u2019s strengths. Daisy surely has to get a stay of execution next week: she\u2019s working hard and is turning out to be a rather adorable person. Ore and Danny need to calm down, work hard and get back on form. And Ed Balls ... well, he\u2019s unstoppable.<br></p>",

That\u2019s truly frightening. Trump would further divide our nation \u2013 his rhetoric alone has deepened existing divides. We must remember the richness immigrants have brought to our country. The first priority of the next president must be to unify us, as nothing can be accomplished in the current atmosphere. This has been the ugliest campaign I have witnessed in my 51 years. Trump\u2019s campaign has been embarrassing and dangerous and it will take a while for the nation to recover. One good thing that has come of this cycle is that it has woken people up from apathy and encouraged them to make their voices heard at the ballot box \u2013 for better or worse.</p> <h2>\u2018We have become a politically correct society to our detriment\u2019<br tabindex=\"-1\"></h2> <ul> <li>Anne-Marie, 69, New Jersey, voting for <strong>Donald Trump</strong></li> </ul> <p>Born in 1946, the first year of the \u201cbaby boom\u201d, I am a second-generation American. I earned my BA, MEd and MA in, respectively, history, teaching and journalism. Most of my working life was in publishing. I have been alone since my divorce some 40 years ago. My views do not fit any one party, and my voting history is mixed. I have voted for Democrats and Republicans, and I threw away a vote on Ralph Nader in 2000 because I could not vote for either of the main candidates. I will vote for Donald Trump. He might not change this country \u2013 Congress can obstruct a president, as it has been doing since 2008 \u2013 but if he could, it would be in directions I support: defeating Isis, strict(er) immigration, encouraging businesses to stay or return here, a much better relationship with Russia, and the disestablishment of the politically correct society we have, to our detriment, become. A president\u2019s priorities should be protecting the American land and people, and promoting the general welfare \u2013 here, stateside. I have found the campaign absolutely horrid. The only good thing about election day is that it ends the campaign. </p> <h2>\u2018Trump\u2019s misogyny, racism and general ignorance astound me\u2019<br tabindex=\"-1\"></h2> <ul> <li>Wendy, 63, California, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m 63 years old, a Democrat, and a retired registered nurse. My husband of 36 years is a retired teacher. We live in Panorama City, a working-class suburb in the San Fernando Valley. This election is the worst I\u2019ve ever seen, and I lived through Watergate and the Vietnam war. Donald Trump\u2019s misogyny, racism and general ignorance astound me. I\u2019m worried that Russia\u2019s attempt to influence the outcome of this election in Trump\u2019s favor might yet succeed. I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m angrier at \u2013 Donald Trump for being a compulsive liar \u2013 or the press for letting him get away with it. Trump\u2019s supporters chanting \u201cLock her up\u201d are the worst. Hillary Clinton is not a criminal! We face serious problems with no easy solutions. Over 20% of our children live in poverty. Climate change is real. We have too many guns and not enough good jobs. Our son is unemployed \u2013 I don\u2019t want Obamacare repealed \u2013 I want it fixed. Hillary has a plan for that. Hillary cares about people, about children and families. She\u2019s a feminist who will appoint supreme court justices who will stand up for women\u2019s rights. Especially if the Democrats take back the Senate, she can get things done. Even Trump conceded that she\u2019s a fighter. This is a historic election and, yeah, I\u2019m excited about it. I didn\u2019t think a woman president would happen in my lifetime. On November 8th, I hope we will elect Hillary Clinton as the first woman president of the United States.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d88c255f6b9784ac704bd2d08318a47aa0ec741a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d88c255f6b9784ac704bd2d08318a47aa0ec741a/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pumpkin portraits of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump by Disney artist Joseph Yakovetic, on Hollywood Blvd, 27 October 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pumpkin portraits of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump by Disney artist Joseph Yakovetic, on Hollywood Blvd, 27 October 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Livingston/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I will remain apprehensive until she is president-elect\u2019</h2> <ul> <li>Sarah, 28, Florida, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m a third-year medical student living in Brooklyn, NY, voting by mail as a Florida resident. My vote this year is unequivocally going to Hillary Clinton. There is a vocal proportion of Clinton voters who make no secret of their reluctant support, whether grudging Bernie Sanders advocates, or voters of any persuasion who oppose Donald Trump only marginally more than they do Clinton. Despite having backed Sanders myself, I take a less noncommittal position: Clinton, far from being the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d, is a remarkably qualified, intelligent candidate whose views largely mirror my own, a stark contrast to the unsympathetic view of her character that is frustratingly widespread. Her proposed policies demonstrate forward thinking that would enable the United States to stand upright as a respected model among nations. I anticipate with hope the improvement of the Affordable Care Act to make healthcare universally affordable, the push to end gun violence, the increase in police accountability, the reform of our prison system, and a social promotion that advances race relations, LGBT rights and gender equity. None of these changes can be expected under the influence of Donald Trump, who sees the truth as tractable, promotes his sexism and narcissism as assets, and in the end, is excessively volatile and unprincipled. It\u2019s embarrassing that Clinton, whose political competence is nigh unparalleled, holds only an uncertain majority over his farcical campaign. While the current poll aggregates are tentatively reassuring, I will remain apprehensive until she is confirmed as president-elect after election day.</p> <h2>\u2018Washington is offering no choice besides disaster\u2019<br></h2> <ul> <li>Geno, 37, Pennsylvania, voting for <strong>Jill Stein</strong></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m in that middle class suffering from decades of neoliberalism \u2013 involuntarily in debt, in a dead-end job because of health coverage and few options. My household can eat and pay bills most of the time, so we\u2019re luckier than some, but doing much more is a rare treat. The nation needs living wages, progressive taxation, universal healthcare, renewable energy, an end to US aggression, and investment in our future instead of the already-rich. Society should support people over profit. The most wretched excuse for a campaign in our lifetimes has only promised the opposite. The major parties offer a deranged rightwing sociopath provoking global war or a reality-TV buffoon with no actual policy, both of them hopelessly corrupt and staggeringly incompetent. Reinforcing Bush-Obama corporatism isn\u2019t an option. Libertarianism is suicidally shortsighted. We need a progressive administration that\u2019ll keep the grassroots engaged in fighting for constructive, sustainable goals. That\u2019s why I\u2019m voting Jill Stein. It\u2019s already too late to prevent a president Clinton; that\u2019s what the establishment wants and that\u2019s what it\u2019ll get. Of course Trump never had a chance \u2013 he\u2019s only there to scare us towards Hillary. No thanks. I won\u2019t throw my vote away on a felon and war criminal. I\u2019d rather affirm policies I actually support. The alternative is staying home, but I\u2019d rather send a message rejecting business as usual (hopefully amplified a little in a swing state). Washington is offering no choice besides disaster. Our first duty is to refuse to be complicit or legitimize it.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m not so much with her as I am against the fascist Donald Trump\u2019<br tabindex=\"-1\"></h2> <ul> <li>Chris, 50, New York, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>My name is Christopher; I am a gay African American illustrator and comic book artist living in New York City with my husband who is an Episcopal seminarian. As a Bernie Sanders supporter, allow me to make my position crystal clear: I\u2019m not so much with her as I am against the fascist, racist and misogynist Donald Trump. I would love to have another choice, but unfortunately, with Jill Stein polling even worse than Gary Johnson I\u2019m forced to be pragmatic and vote for Hillary Clinton. Liberal supreme court nominations; banking, healthcare, student loan and immigration reform; increasing living wages, honest discussions of the true effects of mechanization of labor, infrastructure revitalization, climate change, federal enforcement of police reform \u2026 these should be presidential priorities. Will they be under a centrist Clinton administration? Doubtful. Still, it is my sincere hope that the more progressive side of the Democratic party will apply the appropriate pressure. This entire presidential campaign has been a demoralizing debacle, and I for one can\u2019t wait until election day. I\u2019m just going to need a shower or two to scrub off the stink after leaving the voting booth.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e80b8e18f28860102232c90c229eda747b769af7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e80b8e18f28860102232c90c229eda747b769af7/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders answers a question about college affordability during a Clinton campaign event in Durham, New Hampshire, 28 September 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders answers a question about college affordability during a Clinton campaign event in Durham, New Hampshire, on 28 September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Had Sanders won the primaries, I wouldn\u2019t be writing this\u2019</h2> <ul> <li>Dan, 59, California, voting for <strong>Donald Trump</strong></li> </ul> <p>My name is Dan and I\u2019m an older, white, middle-class male who intends to vote for Donald Trump. But I didn\u2019t start out that way. Although I\u2019ve been a Republican since registering to vote at age 18 I switched to the Democratic party this year in order to vote for Bernie Sanders in the California primary election. Had Sanders won the Democratic primary I wouldn\u2019t be writing this little essay and I would most definitely <em>not</em> be voting for Donald Trump. Let me be clear \u2013 I\u2019m not voting for Trump because I like him. I\u2019m voting for Trump \u2019cause I like Hillary Clinton even less. I don\u2019t think policy positions matter much in a presidential election. Presidents don\u2019t actually get to direct much policy. What matters most to me is leadership. The ability to lead a large organization and inspire those being led. In this respect both candidates have serious liabilities. But Hillary\u2019s appear to be the far more serious breaches of integrity. From her early days on the Nixon impeachment issue to her operation of the state department she has left behind a taint of corruption at the highest levels of government. We are already hearing of the rumblings of disorganization and discontent in both the state and justice department as a result of her corrupting influence. The priority of a president should be to manage the immense federal bureaucracy and inspire citizens. Hillary has proven herself to be singularly inadequate to the task.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m a Mormon Republican voting for Clinton\u2019</h2> <ul> <li>David, 43, Colorado, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m a westerner, having lived and voted in Utah, Nevada and Colorado. I\u2019m educated, with two postgraduate degrees. I\u2019m also religious, having been Mormon all my life. I\u2019ve been a registered Republican since my first voting experience in 1996. I\u2019m voting for Hillary Clinton. Or, to put it more precisely, I\u2019m voting against Donald Trump. The most important factor for me in voting for any public office is character, and I think it is obvious that Trump has the worst character of any candidate I\u2019ve ever seen. There are many very reasonable objections to Clinton, and I\u2019m really not a big fan of hers, but I don\u2019t think they come anywhere close to the magnitude of Trump\u2019s deep moral flaws. I think Clinton is a very capable politician, and I like her experience in public service. I also think she\u2019s quite moderate, which is what I consider myself to be. Presidents are important, but they can\u2019t do all the things for which people often hold them responsible. I think she\u2019ll do well at foreign relations. I think she\u2019ll choose capable but moderate supreme court justices, and I hope that Congress will approve them. This has been a miserable campaign, not just because of the poor field of candidates and the disgusting rhetoric, but also because it has divided the citizenry in very ugly ways. I am voting early, by mail, and I look forward to having the whole thing finished.</p> <h2><br></h2>",
  "<p>The emails currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/democratic-senators-fbi-director-comey-clinton-emails-letter\">roiling the US presidential campaign</a> are part of some unknown digital collection amassed by the troublesome Anthony Weiner, but if your purpose is to understand the clique of people who dominate Washington today, the emails that really matter are the ones being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-paid-wall-street-speeches\">slowly released by WikiLeaks</a> from the hacked account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chair John Podesta. They are last week\u2019s scandal in a year running over with scandals, but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal: they are a window into the soul of the Democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answers.</p> <p>The class to which I refer is not rising in angry protest; they are by and large pretty satisfied, pretty contented. Nobody takes road trips to exotic West Virginia to see what the members of this class looks like or how they live; on the contrary, they are the ones for whom such stories are written. This bunch doesn\u2019t have to make do with a comb-over TV mountebank for a leader; for this class, the choices are always pretty good, and this year they happen to be excellent.</p> <p>They are the comfortable and well-educated mainstay of our modern Democratic party. They are also the grandees of our national media; the architects of our software; the designers of our streets; the high officials of our banking system; the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or fine-tune the Middle East with precision droning. They are, they think, not a class at all but rather the enlightened ones, the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-us-immigration-daca-arizona-obama-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59n4x\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2851228\"            data-video-name=\"'We learned to fight back': Dreamers campaign against Donald Trump \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58140c67e4b08d944ba4bd15\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/29/161028Daca_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/29/161028Daca_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12004004&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-us-immigration-daca-arizona-obama-video\">\u2018We learned to fight back\u2019: Dreamers campaign against Donald Trump</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Let us turn the magnifying glass on them for a change, by sorting through the hacked personal emails of John Podesta, who has been a Washington power broker for decades. I admit that I feel uncomfortable digging through this hoard; stealing someone\u2019s email is a crime, after all, and it is outrageous that people\u2019s personal information has been exposed, since WikiLeaks doesn\u2019t seem to have redacted the emails in any way. There is also the issue of authenticity to contend with: we don\u2019t know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from John Podesta. The supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their authenticity, and though they seem to be real, there is a small possibility they aren\u2019t.</p> <p>With all that taken into consideration, I think the WikiLeaks releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the American status hierarchy in all its righteousness and majesty.</p> <p>The dramatis personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of work: financial innovators. High-achieving colleagues attempting to get jobs for their high-achieving children. Foundation executives doing fine and noble things. Prizes, of course, and high academic achievement.</p> <p>Certain industries loom large and virtuous here. Hillary\u2019s ingratiating speeches to Wall Street are well known of course, but what is remarkable is that, in the party of Jackson and Bryan and Roosevelt, smiling financiers now seem to stand on every corner, constantly proffering advice about this and that. In one now-famous email chain, for example, the reader can watch current US trade representative Michael Froman, writing from a Citibank email address in 2008, <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/137798/important-wikileaks-revelation-isnt-hillary-clinton\">appear to name</a> President Obama\u2019s cabinet even before the great hope-and-change election was decided (incidentally, an important clue to understanding why that greatest of zombie banks was never put out of its misery).</p> <p>The far-sighted innovators of Silicon Valley are also here in force, interacting all the time with the leaders of the party of the people. We watch as Podesta appears to <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15865\">email</a> Sheryl Sandberg. He makes plans to <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/29255\">visit</a> Mark Zuckerberg (who, according to one missive, wants to \u201clearn more about next steps for his philanthropy and social action\u201d). Podesta exchanges emails with an entrepreneur about an ugly race now unfolding for Silicon Valley\u2019s seat in Congress; this man, in turn, appears to forward to Podesta the remarks of yet another Silicon Valley grandee, who <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/19482\">complains</a> that one of the Democratic combatants in that fight was criticizing billionaires who give to Democrats. Specifically, the miscreant Dem in question was said to be:</p> <p>\u201c\u2026 spinning (and attacking) donors who have supported Democrats. John Arnold and Marc Leder have both given to Cory Booker, Joe Kennedy, and others. He is also attacking every billionaire that donates to [Congressional candidate] Ro [Khanna], many whom support other Democrats as well.\u201d</p> <p>Attacking billionaires! In the year 2015! It was, one of the correspondents appears to write, \u201cmadness and political malpractice of the party to allow this to continue\u201d.</p> <p>There are wonderful things to be found in this treasure trove when you search the gilded words \u201cDavos\u201d or \u201cTahoe\u201d. But it is when you search \u201cVineyard\u201d on the WikiLeaks dump that you realize these people truly inhabit a different world from the rest of us. By \u201cvineyard\u201d, of course, they mean Martha\u2019s Vineyard, the ritzy vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts where presidents Clinton and Obama spent most of their summer vacations. The Vineyard is a place for the very, very rich to unwind, yes, but as we learn from these emails, it is also a place of high idealism; a land of enlightened liberal commitment far beyond anything ordinary citizens can ever achieve.</p> <p>Consider, for example, the 2015 <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30396\">email</a> from a foundation executive to a retired mortgage banker (who then seems to have forwarded the note on to Podesta, and thus into history) expressing concern that \u201cHillary\u2019s image is being torn apart in the media and there\u2019s not enough effective push back\u201d. The public eavesdrops as yet another financier <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/24270\">invites</a> Podesta to a dinner featuring \u201cfood produced exclusively by the island\u2019s farmers and fishermen which will be matched with specially selected wines\u201d. We learn how a Hillary campaign aide <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/19449\">recommended</a> that a policy statement appear on a certain day so that \u201cIt wont get in the way of any other news we are trying to make \u2013 but far enough ahead of Hamptons and Vineyard money events\u201d. We even read the <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32784\">pleadings</a> of a man who wants to be invited to a state dinner at the White House and who offers, as one of several exhibits in his favor, the fact that he \u201cjoined the DSCC Majority Trust in Martha\u2019s Vineyard (contributing over $32,400 to Democratic senators) in July 2014\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59yvc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2849673\"            data-video-name=\"How does the US electoral college work? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian/Getty Images\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58136bc4e4b08d944ba4ba7a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028elect1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028elect1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028elect1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\">How does the US electoral college work?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>(Hilariously, in another <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/8640\">email chain</a>, the Clinton team appears to scheme to \u201chit\u201d Bernie Sanders for attending \u201cDSCC retreats on Martha\u2019s Vineyard with lobbyists\u201d.)</p> <p>Then there is the apparent nepotism, the dozens if not hundreds of mundane emails in which petitioners for this or that plum Washington job or high-profile academic appointment politely appeal to Podesta \u2013 the ward-heeler of the meritocratic elite \u2013 for a solicitous word whispered in the ear of a powerful crony.</p> <p>This genre of Podesta email, in which people try to arrange jobs for themselves or their kids, points us toward the most fundamental thing we know about the people at the top of this class: their loyalty to one another and the way it overrides everything else. Of course Hillary Clinton staffed her state department with investment bankers and then did speaking engagements for investment banks as soon as she was done at the state department. Of course she <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927\">appears to think</a> that any kind of bank reform should \u201ccome from the industry itself\u201d. And of course no elite bankers were ever prosecuted by the Obama administration. Read these emails and you understand, with a start, that the people at the top tier of American life all know each other. They are all engaged in promoting one another\u2019s careers, constantly.</p> <p>Everything blurs into everything else in this world.

  "<p>Far-right leader Geert Wilders has gone on trial in the Netherlands on charges of inciting discrimination and hatred of Moroccans.</p> <p>The case comes as Dutch, French and German voters gear up for a series of elections next year in which populist rightwing groups, such as Wilders\u2019s Freedom party (PVV), will seek to make immigration a central issue.</p> <p>On Friday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/28/dutch-far-right-mp-geert-wilders-says-race-hate-trial-is-travesty\">Wilders announced that he would be boycotting the trial</a>, which he called a travesty and \u201cagainst freedom of expression\u201d. In a column for the AD newspaper, he claimed that he spoke for \u201cmillions of Dutch people, fed up with the disruption and terror caused by so many Moroccans \u2026 If talking about that is an offence, the Netherlands is no longer a free country, but a dictatorship\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In a statement read out by one of his lawyers on Monday, Wilders said he had done nothing wrong. \u201cIt is my right and my duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country. Because the Netherlands has a mega Moroccan problem,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>The charges relate to an evening in March 2014 when Wilders\u2019s party narrowly failed to become the largest group on the city council in The Hague. Wilders asked a room packed with supporters and activists if they wanted to have \u201cmore or fewer Moroccans\u201d in the country. To the response of \u201cfewer\u201d, Wilders replied: \u201cWell, we\u2019ll take care of that.\u201d</p> <p>More than 6,000 people filed official complaints to the police about Wilders\u2019 comments and, nine months later, he was formally charged with racial discrimination and inciting hatred. The maximum sentence is two years in prison, although fines and community service orders are more common. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/un-human-rights-high-commisioner-zeid-raad-al-husseins-speech-reject-populist-bigots-in-full\">UN human rights chief  Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein calls for world to reject populist bigots - in full</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wilders has been the frontrunner for the parliamentary elections next March for about a year, but the latest opinion polls show him running either neck and neck or just behind the Liberals (VVD) of prime minister Mark Rutte, with about 18% of the vote in the highly fragmented Dutch landscape. </p> <p>His shrinking lead has coincided with a steep drop in the number of refugees arriving in the Netherlands since last year when plans to build new centres for asylum seekers led to riots outside town halls.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Wilders has hardened his anti-Islam, anti-EU stance for the election campaign. His party\u2019s draft manifesto includes pledges to shut every mosque \u2013 previously Wilders merely opposed building new ones. It also calls for a ban on the Koran and headscarves from government buildings, the tearing up of the Schengen open borders agreement and a \u201cNexit\u201d referendum to follow the UK out of the European Union.</p> <p>Wilders has dismissed repeated calls to withdraw or apologise for his remarks, which have made his party a pariah in Dutch politics. Rutte has ruled out any collaboration between his Liberal group and the PVV until Wilders issues a retraction. </p> <p>But the prime minister has not shirked from strong language on migration either; in a recent TV interview, he said Dutch Turks who held pro-Erdogan demonstrations in Rotterdam in July should \u201cget lost\u201d.</p> <p>Wilders retorted that he would not govern with the Liberals while Rutte remained leader. There is a history of antagonism between the two men: Rutte\u2019s first government, in 2010, was a minority administration propped up by a post-election pact with the PVV, but collapsed after 18 months when Wilders refused to back a \u20ac14bn austerity package.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/23/munich-violence-rocks-europe-politics\">Violence rocks political foundations of fractured, fearful Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under the Dutch proportional representation system, the leader of the largest party is conventionally given the first shot at forming a government. But these are unconventional times; most other parties have ruled out a coalition with Wilders and, if the district court in The Hague finds him guilty, voters will have to decide whether to endorse a convicted criminal as their prime minister.</p> <p>It is not the first time that Wilders\u2019 public statements have landed him in court. In 2011, he was acquitted of discriminating against, and inciting hatred towards, Muslims in interviews in which he denounced Islam as a \u201cfascist\u201d religion. But the case is stronger this time because his comments were directed against a racial group, according to Henny Sackers, professor of administrative criminal law at Radboud University in Nijmegen. </p> <p>\u201cThe European court says you can criticise religion in public even if it shocks, hurts or disturbs,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the case of discrimination on grounds of nationality, you can be guilty of an offence in Dutch law if you provoke social unrest. So I see the chances of a conviction for Wilders as being considerably higher than three years ago.</p> <p>\u201cThose who know our constitutional law say this trial has come at a very unfortunate time for democracy. Whether Wilders is acquitted or convicted, he will present himself as the Dutch Donald Trump, a crusader for the free word. It will always give him a potential electoral advantage.\u201d</p>",

If we get attacked, Japan doesn\u2019t have to help us,\u201d he said. \u201cSomehow, that doesn\u2019t sound so fair.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s frequent claim that Japan is taking advantage of US largesse is inaccurate. Tokyo contributes \u00a5192bn ($1.84bn) a year towards maintaining the US military presence. US bases in Japan cost about $5.5bn a year, according to the Pentagon, about half of which goes on salaries and other personnel costs.</p> <p>South Korea, meanwhile, contributes $850m a year \u2013 about half the cost of maintaining 28,500 troops on the southern side of the heavily fortified border that divides the Korean peninsula.</p> <p>Yet Trump has returned to the theme throughout the campaign: \u201cAs far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the world,\u201d he said at an event in Las Vegas. \u201cWe\u2019re defending other countries, we\u2019re spending a fortune doing it.

The perpetrator, Omar Mateen, was of Afghan origin, and Trump\u2019s explicit linking of Afghans to terrorism earned him widespread contempt.<br></p> <p>Afghans in general seem unsure of what either candidate has in store for their country, apart from two indications from the Trump campaign: his proposed ban on Muslims from entering America; and his calls to pull American troops home, or at least limit their role in Afghanistan, which would likely have a destabilising effect on the country. Neither is popular with Afghans.<br></p> <p>Recently, though, Afghans have mostly treated the US elections with a certain sarcastic distance. After the third presidential debate, Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the election results if he did not win led to a wave of snarky commentary on social media. Some suggested that perhaps the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, would need to fly to Washington to broker a national unity government deal, as the US secretary of state, John Kerry, did after the divisive 2014 Afghan election.<br></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sune-engel-rasmussen\">Sune Engel Rasmussen</a> in Kabul</em></p> <h2>Germany </h2> <p>If Hillary Clinton were to run against Donald Trump for the German presidency, she would win by a landslide.

Among these voters, stories about the candidates\u2019 foibles did nothing to dent their popularity. Both could only be brought down by their own self-destructive tendencies, Zucconi concluded.</p> <p>Gianni Riotta, the former editor of Il Sole 24 Ore, said that \u2013 despite being a \u201cdisastrous\u201d prime minister \u2013 Berlusconi was a more astute politician than Trump has proven to be, having counted both George W Bush and Vladimir Putin as friends.

If the infighting continues, then there\u2019s a chance that Ukip, in the way it is now, will not be here this time next year.\u201d</p> <p>Nuttall, a Ukip MEP for the North West, declined to run in the leadership race over the summer. But after the abrupt departure of Diane James just 18 days into the leader\u2019s job, he said he felt he was the only senior party member who stood a chance of healing divisions. </p> <p>He has spent the last few weeks in his home town of Liverpool, gathering nominations from Ukip MEPs, Welsh assembly members and executive committee. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get them in early,\u201d he said jokingly, referring to Woolfe\u2019s leadership bid in the summer, when he submitted his nominations 17 minutes late. Woolfe has since left the party. </p> <p>Nuttall faces a runoff with Suzanne Evans, the author of the party\u2019s 2015 manifesto and a close ally of its only MP, Douglas Carswell, both of whom are bitter opponents of former leader Nigel Farage. Raheem Kassam, a former Farage aide, is running on a promise to continue his mentor\u2019s agenda, and to expel Evans and Carswell from the party.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the issues are down to ideology. It\u2019s a personality problem,\u201d Nuttall said. \u201cAnd those at the top of the party have got to understand that the cause is bigger than the personality. We have to get over it, and everyone has to rally round the new leader. It\u2019s day zero \u2013 bygones have to be bygones.\u201d</p> <p>Nuttall, who chuckles at the suggestion that Kassam is Farage\u2019s candidate, said he did not belong to any faction. \u201cI will not be a Farage-ista or a Carswell-ite \u2013 it will be a Ukip for everyone. I do not do factionalism, I am not interested in infighting. It has to stop, and it will stop if I win on November 28.\u201d</p> <p>Kassam has said Nuttall, far from being the unity candidate, will try to depose Farage as the head of the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD) grouping at the European parliament if elected Ukip leader. The EFDD role is a lucrative one and involves representing rightwing MEPs from across the EU, including populist parties such as the Swedish Democrats and Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement.</p> <p>Nuttall denied that there was a \u201cMachiavellian plot\u201d against his former leader, but said he hoped he and Farage would \u201ccome to an agreement\u201d. Hinting that he would like to take on the EFDD role, Nuttall said: \u201cIf the opportunity became available, of course, as leader of Ukip, I would like to do it, but it would only be done with agreement of Nigel.\u201d</p> <p>Talk of a coup was \u201ccomplete baloney\u201d, he said. \u201cTrust me, it will not be problem, and we will sort it out over a nice beer, not through coups. This will be a new Ukip, where backstabbing will not be tolerated.\u201d</p> <p>One of Nuttall\u2019s first priorities would be to heal the rift with Carswell, who has kept himself at a distance from any leadership debate. \u201cTo Douglas I would say, \u2018Be part of the team, be collegiate,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe have open goals, we have to make sure we are on the pitch to kick the ball in the back of the net.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Bootle, Merseyside, and a survivor of the Hillsborough stadium disaster, Nuttall is the antithesis of Evans and James, both from the Tory shires. The former lecturer is seen as Ukip\u2019s most viable leader in terms of winning over Labour voters in the Midlands and the north. </p> <p>Though Nuttall admitted that he found Theresa May\u2019s Tory party conference speech \u201con the surface quite impressive\u201d, voters in traditional working-class communities \u201cwould literally rather remove their own eyeballs with spoons than vote Conservative\u201d, he said. \u201cThey remember the miners\u2019 strike, the poll tax riots, the inequality of the late 1980s, when people were on the breadline in the north and the Midlands.\u201d</p> <p>Nuttall said he wanted to shift Ukip\u2019s focus back to local politics, with constituency and wards are also riven with infighting. \u201cIf we can prove Ukip councillors are responsible, that they can hold briefs, we can use that as a Trojan horse to Westminster in 2020. If I win, local government will be the heart of everything I do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Nuttall said that although Ukip\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre was pushing for a hard Brexit \u2013 out of the single market and with a points-based immigration system \u2013 the party had to find new causes to lead on. One in particular, is a rethink on devolution to Scotland and Wales. </p> <p>\u201cThe union that we all love is under attack, and it needs to be rebalanced, and England needs equality,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I will push the case for an English parliament. That\u2019s something we can take up, fairness for the English.</p> <p>\u201cUkip is at its best at its most radical, when we are the outriders on issues and we lead and don\u2019t follow.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Immigration is likely to remain an overarching theme in European politics. And for a long time yet.

On one side are liberal internationalists attached to fundamental asylum principles or to the dream of a borderless world; on the other are xenophobic fence-builders who see migration as a modern version of barbaric invasions threatening culture and civilisation. The latter, alas, tend to hold sway.</p> <p>One of the collateral damages of post-truth politics is that not only the present gets distorted \u2013 the past gets rewritten as well. Racist videos online depict fantasies of Europe \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d migration. \u201cBefore\u201d is depicted with orderly scenes of 1950s streets, shops and parks where an all-white population strolls or plays happily. \u201cAfter\u201d is groups of dark-faced men attacking women, rioting against the police, shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d.</p> <p>The essential narrative of bigots is that our European world is collapsing under the onslaught of mass arrivals from cultures that we cannot possibly mingle with. In France, a theory called the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11323557/Enfant-terribles-literary-vision-of-an-Islamic-France.html\">great replacement</a>\u201d has spread to large parts of the right and certainly the far-right. It states that, as a result of immigration, the nation\u2019s core population is set to be replaced by non-European outsiders who will wreck the country\u2019s identity. There are also echoes of this in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/27/pegida-germany-anti-immigrant-group-polarising-dresden\">Germany\u2019s Pegida movement,</a> whose full name is \u201cPatriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the west\u201d.</p> <p>Debunking these myths can be hard work. Hatred and passions overtake rational approaches and documented facts get swept away. It is even harder when Europe\u2019s long history of almost constant population movement and mixing of cultures is ignored, untaught or forgotten. For example, it\u2019s often said that the arrival of Arabs and Muslims in France started when post-second world war reconstruction efforts required a new labour force, or after Algeria became independent in 1962. Yet Algerians (especially from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabylie\">Kabylie</a>) have been in France for at least a century. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/29/world/europe/a-life-spent-remembering-a-war-france-has-tried-to-forget.html?_r=0\">French historian Benjamin Stora</a> says the real challenge of immigration is \u201cthe challenge of knowing the other\u201d \u2013 and it goes both ways.</p> <p>The 2015 refugee crisis has held up a mirror to Europeans: it\u2019s forced them to ask themselves who they are, how they define themselves and their actions. The <a href=\"http://time.com/4434720/1-3-million-migrants-2015-pew/\">1.3 million people</a> who reached the continent last year represented only <a href=\"http://www.stand.ie/refugee-crisis-are-the-numbers-really-that-big/\">0.2% of the EU\u2019s total population</a>. It should have been manageable. Germany alone took in roughly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/20/germany-raises-estimate-refugee-arrivals-800000\">800,000</a>. That\u2019s equivalent to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/aug/20/asylum-seekers-eu-comparison-germany-datablog\">1% of its own population</a>, and is the same number it absorbed in 1992 when people fled the Balkan wars and ethnic Germans left the former Soviet Union..</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bigots claim that Europe is collapsing under mass arrivals from cultures we cannot possibly mingle with</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If there was a crisis in 2015, it had less to do with the refugees \u2013 who knew what they were fleeing and where they wanted to go \u2013 and much more to do more with European governments and societies who did not all step up to the plate. In fact, Europe isn\u2019t confronted with a refugee and migrant crisis. It\u2019s the refugees and migrants who are confronted with a crisis of Europe. The scandal is that, in the Mediterranean, they have been paying with their lives.</p> <p>Demographers point out that the pivotal migration year for Europe was 2014. That\u2019s when <a href=\"http://www.college-de-france.fr/site/colloque-2016/symposium-2016-10-14-14h30.htm\">Europe for the first time surpassed the US as a destination for immigrants, according to the French demographer Fran\u00e7ois H\u00e9ran</a>. Around <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Migration_and_migrant_population_statistics\">1.9 million legal immigrants</a> came to the EU (population 508 million) and <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/06/us/immigration-statistics-fast-facts/\">1 million to the US</a> (population 319 million). With that, the European ratio became 3.7 legal immigrants per 1,000 inhabitants, while the US\u2019s was 3.1. This is the new, transformative reality many Europeans have yet to acknowledge.</p> <p>Historically, Europe exported its population, whether to distant colonial possessions for conquest and domination, or to the New World as a consequence of poverty, persecution or war. Now, it has become the foremost magnet and refuge for those who seek safety and a better life. We are simply much richer and more stable than many other parts of the world.</p> <p>And our diversity is set to grow, but not in the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d scenario. Europe needs immigration as an injection of youth and dynamism if in the decades to come it wants to address its workforce and pension problems.</p> <p>Europeans were once the huddled masses on boats reaching Ellis Island, in New York, or <a href=\"http://www.pier21.ca/home/\">Pier 21 in Halifax</a>, Canada\u2019s gateway for immigrants \u2013 both now museums. I visited Pier 21 a few years ago, and spent some time looking at pictures of Hungarian refugees who had fled the repression of the <a href=\"http://time.com/3878232/the-hungarian-revolution-of-1956-photos-from-the-streets-of-budapest/\">1956 Budapest uprising and celebrated their arrival</a>. Perhaps <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-28/orban-says-he-seeks-to-end-liberal-democracy-in-hungary\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n</a>, Hungary\u2019s self-avowedly \u201cilliberal\u201d prime minister, who shuns refugees, should take a look. Perhaps other European politicians should too.</p> <p>Canada and the US are countries whose creation derived from the movement of people to faraway shores; European nations are rooted otherwise. But Europe could draw inspiration from the capacity to form a positive narrative that embraces migration instead of treating it mainly as a threat. Europe, as the new continent of immigration, will increasingly need that narrative.</p>",

The man known to legions of Star Wars fans as the <a href=\"http://www.starwars.com/databank/emperor-palpatine-darth-sidious\">Emperor Palpatine</a> is now playing Powell in Chris Hannan\u2019s play What Shadows. He\u2019s even grown a silver-grey moustache for the occasion.</p> <p>How does he feel about getting his tongue around Powell\u2019s divisive language? The answer, from an actor who has played such polarising characters as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/feb/13/life-of-galileo-review\">Galileo</a>, Denis Thatcher and Satan, is typically magnanimous. \u201cI have to do him justice. Chris has written a rounded character, so I\u2019ve just got to get it right.\u201d</p> <p>When pressed, his instinct is not to excuse Powell\u2019s racism but to see him as a politician infuriated by the reluctance of either the Conservatives or Labour to discuss immigration in public.

You\u2019d see him moved to heights of rhetorical fury but he also cried a lot in private. That\u2019s a gift for an actor to play.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, but Powell was also prepared to quote one of his constituents as saying: \u201cIn this country in 15 or 20 years time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man.\u201d Conservative leader Edward Heath said the speech was \u201cracialist in tone and liable to exacerbate racial tensions\u201d and sacked him as a member of the shadow cabinet.

Birmingham had one of the most tightly contested votes in the UK, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis\">50.4% opting to leave</a>. Instead, he wanted to push the discussion about race and identity beyond the polarised arguments that have led to our current impasse. \u201cPeople are going to turn up who admire Enoch and people who loathe him from the depths of their boots,\u201d says the playwright, who redrafted the script in the light of the referendum. \u201cI imagined an audience of liberals and conservatives.

Early in rehearsals, Scroggs tweeted a picture of her Powell-related reading list and asked: \u201cIs conversation possible with those we are sworn to hate?\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s a question that echoes the opening lines of the play: \u201cHow to talk to people we hate? How to speak across the anger that divides us?\u201d Such entrenched positions remind Hannan of his formative years growing up in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/glasgow\">Glasgow</a> on the Catholic side of Scotland\u2019s sectarian divide. \u201cOne can criticise Enoch Powell, but what one can\u2019t do is say he needs to stay in some intellectual gulag,\u201d he says. \u201cOur fellow citizens need to be addressed and that speech needs to be addressed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb87e79e7ecfed69aab3b27f0456f3cbdb8b02c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb87e79e7ecfed69aab3b27f0456f3cbdb8b02c1/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Is conversation possible with those we are sworn to hate?\u2019 \u2026 Rebecca Scroggs and Brid Brennan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Is conversation possible with those we are sworn to hate?\u2019 \u2026 Rebecca Scroggs and Brid Brennan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ellie Kurttz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s extraordinary about Powell is that, nearly 50 years after his notorious speech, his name still has an emotive power.

  "<p>This was not written by Sam Wollaston. When Wollaston came to work yesterday, he was told that the Guardian had issued a standardisation programme across all operations, and that his would no longer be a human role. This review was therefore produced by a synth, a green-eyed anthropomorphic robot, using statistical analysis of the electrical responses in the brains of a test group of sentient synths who were shown the television programme <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/humans\"><strong>Humans</strong></a> (Channel 4, Sunday).</p> <p>Oi! What do you mean that would be an improvement?</p> <p>I was begging for it, I guess. But I\u2019m still here \u2013 just, for about another five minutes, if things keep progressing as they are. In this series-two opener, Joe loses his job as a regional distribution manager to a synth. Science fiction? Maybe, but in the real world of logistics, last week a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/10/ubers-self-driving-truck-makes-first-delivery-50000-beers/\">driverless truck made a delivery of beer in Colorado</a>.

A human one, a boy, who is part of a government scheme to get people back to work. Man works for machine. How do Joe and Laura, the boy and <em>you</em> feel about that?</p> <p>It\u2019s one of the beauties of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/humans\">Humans</a>: it constantly throws up interesting questions about tech and the future that also resonate with the present and relate to humanity, ethics, politics, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/immigration\">immigration</a> even. (Synths are basically immigrants \u2013 they do all the shitty jobs and now people feel threatened by them.) In the first series, these were mainly questions about whether you would get one; and, if so, would you have sex with it; and, if so, and if you were also with someone else, to what extent would that be cheating on them (it gets more complicated with sentient synths, like Anita, with whom Joe had sex). Now, it\u2019s getting more complex still, as sentience spreads. It is about procreation, morality and rights.</p> <p>That is what is happening \u2013 sentience is spreading. Niska, another sentient synth, ran off with the consciousness code, remember? Now a lesbian living in Berlin, she releases the programme on to the net. So that, in Bolivia, an underground mining synth suddenly feels his fingers and a strong urge to see daylight. At a Nottingham chemical plant, another worker synth drops her load and makes a run for it. They hook up with Max and Leo who are still hanging around in the woods. The miner came here by stowing away on trucks and ships. Ring any bells? But there are bad guys in the woods, too, with vans and guns, out to get them. Humans is a pulse-quickening thriller, and the chase is back on. Noooo, the Bolivian gets shot, before he has even chosen himself a name.</p> <p>Anita, meanwhile, works at a failing beach cafe, doing her best not to show she has feelings to her nice, unbusinesslike employer/owner who she clearly has feelings for. When she can, she slips away to feel the grass, or the sea breeze on her cheek and other un-robot-like things.</p> <p>And Joe and Laura are seeing a relationship counsellor because of what happened with Anita. The counsellor\u2019s a synth, and that might be a good idea \u2013 basing her advice on statistical evidence. Plus, Joe and Laura appear to be able to open up and be honest to her in a way they might not be able to if she was human. They also seem to be re-bonding with each other over the absurdity of the situation. Shrinkbots \u2013 along with automated lorry drivers and regional distribution managers \u2013 may make sense. Human writing, I\u2019m hoping, might hold out a little longer. Humans is certainly very humanly written \u2013 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/10/humans-robot-drama-series\">Sam Vincent and Jonathan Brackley</a>, both humans, I think. And it\u2019s a very human show.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b081v8yc\"><strong>Nigel Farage Gets His Life Back</strong></a> (BBC2, Sunday), Kevin Bishop gets the voice, the intonation, the wheezy smoker\u2019s laugh and the mannerisms of his subject so spot on that it soon doesn\u2019t matter that he doesn\u2019t look much like him. A spoof doc that follows the interim Ukip leader around after his (third) resignation in July \u2013 to the pub, to the man-cave. It\u2019s not actually very funny. Perhaps that is because a good impression alone is no longer enough, or because the mockumentary format is wearing a little thin. Or \u2013 and, again, this could be seen as testament to the spot-onness of Bishop\u2019s performance \u2013 it could simply be that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage\">Nigel Farage</a> isn\u2019t very funny, either.</p>",

  "<p>Nissan was convinced to stay in the UK with a promise of no tariffs or extra bureaucratic burdens on the car industry after Brexit, the business secretary has finally revealed, prompting fears that sector-by-sector deals could cost the taxpayer \u201ccolossal amounts of money\u201d.</p> <p>Greg Clark caved in after four days of pressure in an interview on Sunday to reveal some details of how the government convinced the Japanese manufacturer to produce a fleet of new vehicles at its Sunderland plant. The Tory minister said he wrote to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nissan\">Nissan</a> with a series of four assurances as he went \u201call out\u201d to allay concerns about Brexit, promising that the government was confident of securing a deal that would keep the car industry competitive.</p> <p>\u201cOur intention, our negotiating remit, when it comes to the discussions with our European partners, is to have a constructive dialogue and look for the common interest here,\u201d Clark told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. \u201cOur objective would be to ensure we have continued access to the markets in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> and vice versa without tariffs and bureaucratic impediments, and that is how we will approach those negotiations.\u201d He suggested that this applied to the car industry in general and possibly to other major sectors of UK business.</p> <p>That suggests No 10 is seeking a free trade relationship for the automotive industry that at least brings benefits similar to membership of the single market and customs union. Theresa May has however said she wants greater immigration controls and freedom from the oversight of the European court of justice \u2013 a combination that Brussels politicians have repeatedly said is unachievable.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/oct/30/uk-seeks-brexit-deal-with-no-trade-tariffs-for-car-companies-nissan-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5a2vk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2855513\"            data-video-name=\"UK seeks Brexit deal with \u2018no trade tariffs\u2019 for car companies \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC The Andrew Marr Show\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5815efc6e4b0219a00d3a47f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/30/161030MarrClark_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846490&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846490&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/oct/30/uk-seeks-brexit-deal-with-no-trade-tariffs-for-car-companies-nissan-video\">UK seeks Brexit deal with \u2018no trade tariffs\u2019 for car companies \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The admission prompted questions about the financial cost of protecting the industry from the impact of Brexit. Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister, wrote to Clark, his former cabinet office colleague, warning that a series of deals for different industry sectors could cost the taxpayer \u201ccolossal amounts of money\u201d in subsidies.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats\u2019 spokesman on Brexit also raised the prospect that the UK might have to continue paying billions into the EU budget in order to secure preferential trading terms with the single market for certain industries or all of them.</p> <p>On the promise relating to Brexit, Clark told Marr that the UK could not know the outcome of negotiations with the other 27 members but that it was \u201cvery important that we make a commitment to keep competitive the UK industry\u201d through the government\u2019s industrial strategy. </p> <p>The business secretary said there was no specific promise to compensate Nissan if it did face tariffs, because that would not be allowed under competition laws, but the letter of comfort had been sufficient to persuade the carmaker to continue investing in north-east England. The letter contained promises of a continuation of funds for training, skills and scientific research, and regional relocation grants.</p> <p>In his letter to Clark, Clegg said the news that Nissan was staying was welcome, but questioned whether the assurances were \u201cpart of a planned strategy with a desired endpoint or a one-off concession which shows those that shout the loudest get the best deal from ministers\u201d.</p> <p>Clegg, who is playing a leading role in the Open Britain campaign group, called for more clarity on what it meant for No 10\u2019s wider Brexit strategy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/30/greg-clark-brexit-negotiations-andrew-marr-show-nissan-auto-industry\">Greg Clark's big reveal on 'demeanour' of Brexit negotiations strategy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAny assurances given about our future relationship with the customs union and the single market would go to the very heart of the Brexit negotiations, revealing whether the government is intending to stay within either, or whether you intend to negotiate a patchwork of carve-outs, subsidies and sectoral arrangements, which will create winners and losers and may cost the taxpayer colossal amounts of money,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Clark\u2019s interview led to further criticism that the government had been telling industry more about No 10\u2019s negotiating aims than the UK electorate. Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cWhile we welcome the commitment to securing tariff-free trade for the automotive sector, Greg Clark has raised more questions than he\u2019s answered. What about other manufacturing sectors, or services, which, let\u2019s not forget, account for 90% of our economy?

Adversaries, comrades and former lovers, they bet that if Valmont can win the affections of the notoriously prim Madame de Tourvel (Birgitte Hjort S\u00f8rensen, of Borgen fame), the Marquise will once again grant him her favors. </p> <p>If he can also manage to deflower a silly teenager just released from a convent (Elena Kampouris), so much the better. </p> <p>\u201cLove and revenge,\u201d the Marquise entices Valmont. \u201cTwo of your favourites.\u201d</p> <p>Liaisons was revived on Broadway fairly recently, in a 2008 production that starred Laura Linney and Ben Daniels and did little to surmount audience memories of Alan Rickman and Lindsay Duncan in the stage debut or Glenn Close and John Malkovich in the Stephen Frears film. </p> <p>That revival felt trivial; this one feels a little more ponderous. Rourke and some of the actors take the script so seriously they sometimes forget to have much fun with it. What\u2019s the point of all those bodices if they won\u2019t be ripped? </p> <p>Even the set seems rather somber, a distressed chateau that suggests the ways in which sexual gamesmanship and societal manipulation continue from pre-revolutionary France to the present.</p> <p>Rourke offers a feminist reading of the work, one in which the roles women play, by force and by choice, are closely examined. Observations about gender dynamics (\u201cOur sex has few enough advantages, you may as well make the most of those you have\u201d; \u201cMen enjoy the happiness they feel; we can only enjoy the happiness we give\u201d) are afforded particular weight. </p> <p>This is an astute and intellectually provocative approach, but it doesn\u2019t always serve the rather more salacious script and has the undesired effect of making a grandly hyped battle of the sexes into a first-round KO. </p> <p>This production has no doubt that Merteuil will win, though at some cost to herself, and Schreiber seems to sense this. There\u2019s a saturnine, slightly defeated air to his alcoholic Valmont. Despite Schreiber\u2019s height, swagger and masculine force, his Valmont is no match for Merteuil. He layers some of his eventual rout into the earlier scenes, all but ceding the stage to McTeer.</p> <p>McTeer knows what to do with it. She has set her voice somewhere between purr and growl and arranged her hands and arms into movements that are both perfect expressions of court gestures and precise parodies of them. Her Merteuil is both elegant and vicious, with an air of surface refinement barely concealing the ferocity below. </p> <p>There are claws beneath her manicure, fangs behind her smile.
