On Saturday, <a href=\"http://www.mcall.com/news/local/elections/mc-pa-poll-trump-clinton-toomey-mcginty-20161105-story.html\">a Morning Call poll</a> put Toomey up just 43% to 42% against the Democrat, Katie McGinty, in a race that could be key to deciding control of the Senate.</p> <p>Obama also admonished Toomey for his role in the current impasse over his supreme court nominee, Merrick Garland, saying: \u201cVoting to shut down the government and against bills to close the terrorist gun loophole isn\u2019t courage. And playing politics with the supreme court isn\u2019t courage.\u201d</p> <p>The same Morning Call poll put Trump six points behind Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, one of the states he would probably need to win the White House on Tuesday.

  "<p>The tragic story that Modou Barrow turned over in his mind this week felt depressingly familiar to the Swansea City winger. It concerned the news that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/03/gambian-goalkeeper-who-died-in-mediterranean-wanted-to-play-for-major-club\">Fatim Jawara, the goalkeeper of the Gambia women\u2019s team</a>, had drowned in the Mediterranean after the boat she was on board was hit by a sudden storm. The 19-year-old had been trying to cross from Libya to Italy to chase her dreams in Europe and build a better life.</p> <p>\u201cI found out about it on Thursday. It\u2019s very sad,\u201d says Barrow, who is the only Gambian to have played in the Premier League. \u201cThe area I lived in, where I was brought up in the Gambia, some of the houses next to me have people who died on this route. A lot of people have passed away this way. But this was in the newspaper, maybe because of sport and she\u2019s a footballer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/05/emre-can-liverpool-steven-gerrard-jurgen-klopp\">Emre Can: \u2018It is nice to be compared to Gerrard but I am not the same level\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSome of the people, they see that their parents are struggling, so they want to take the opportunity to go to Europe and maybe get a job where they can help their parents and brothers and sisters back home. I know that\u2019s what [Jawara] was trying to do. She couldn\u2019t get a visa and nobody could help with passports, so she thought: \u2018Let me take this way.\u2019 A lot of Gambians have done it.\u201d</p> <p>Barrow knows all about the hardship that fuels such desperation. He nods when it is put to him that 60% of the population in the Gambia live in poverty and goes on to explain how he tries to do all he can to make a small difference whenever he returns to his homeland, where every trip is poignant because of the opportunity it gives him to visit the grave of his mother, who died when he was a child.</p> <p>\u201cBack home it\u2019s not easy and that\u2019s why always when I\u2019m there I\u2019m trying to do my best to help,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I go back I buy bags of rice with onions and oil \u2013 big bottles \u2013 and I share it to each house. Last year I donated rams and this year my father did it. When people have food, it keeps their mind out of that kind of thinking [risking their lives by making a hazardous journey]. Some of the other guys in the national team who play in Europe are doing the same as me, but even if they do that it\u2019s not going to help everybody.\u201d</p> <p>Although born in the Gambia, Barrow lived in Sweden for more than a decade. His parents separated and when his father, a plumber, took a job in Sweden, Barrow moved there with the elder two of his four brothers. It was a huge change and made all the more difficult when he was given the most devastating news. \u201cI was nine years old, almost 10, when my mum passed away,\u201d Barrow says. \u201cI had just come to Sweden, I was young and so my Dad didn\u2019t want to tell me at first, so I didn\u2019t find out for a couple of months.</p> <p>\u201cMy mum was ill for one day only. She woke up and was happy \u2013 my sisters and my [younger] brothers told me because they witnessed everything. But then all of a sudden she was complaining of a pain in the chest, which is not normal because none of our family had that before.\u201d</p> <p>Barrow, not surprisingly, struggled to cope. \u201cWhen I was at school in Sweden I used to be angry, I used to fight a lot, they had to call my dad and get him to take me away \u2013 it was because of my mother passing away. I was sad and a bit lost, because she was my best friend. I was always with my mum, so I was closest with her.</p> <p>\u201cMy mum suffered a lot for me. She would spend her own money in the market on buying football boots, so that I could use them to play. There\u2019s nothing I can do now, but I wish she was here, so that with everything I get now I could buy her things that she could enjoy.\u201d</p> <p>The one thing that helped Barrow to make friends and adapt to his new life in of Vaxjo was his football skills. In the Gambia, Barrow remembers how he used to come home from school, drop his bag inside the door and dash to the makeshift pitch on the beach until the sun went down. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a lot of time to think about poverty or being hungry \u2013 the only thing I cared about was taking the ball,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Those hours of practice showed in the playground in Sweden, where the father of one of Barrow\u2019s school friends was manager of a local team and \u201ccame to my dad\u2019s house and begged him for me to join them\u201d. Through playing football as well as taking language lessons at school, Barrow\u2019s Swedish became better \u2013 he describes it now as \u201cgood but not excellent\u201d \u2013 while his speed and trickery on the wing caught the eye of a club called Mjolby Sodra, who offered him a scholarship.</p> <p>After spells with a couple of other Swedish teams, Barrow\u2019s career took off at Ostersund, where he thrived under the management of Graham Potter, who made eight Premier League appearances for Southampton in the mid-1990s, and his assistant Billy Reid, who had been in charge of Hamilton Academical and Clyde. \u201cThey believed in what I had,\u201d Barrow says.</p> <p>With pace to burn, Barrow attracted serious interest from Bolton Wanderers and in August 2014 was offered a trial at Swansea. \u201cI was going to be there for three days, but after the first session I was told that Swansea wanted to offer me a contract. I think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/garry-monk\">Garry Monk</a> [the manager at the time] saw something. He knew that maybe I\u2019d find it difficult in the beginning, but perhaps if he kept me for a year, with my pace and technique, he could help me learn.\u201d</p> <p>In a whirlwind first few months, Barrow swapped Sweden for Wales, became a father for the first time when Alice, his daughter, was born in Swansea that September and in November, almost two years ago to the day, made his Premier League debut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/09/swansea-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">in a 2-1 victory over Arsenal</a>, when he had a hand in Gylfi Sigurdsson\u2019s equaliser.</p> <p>For the people in the Gambia, it was a landmark moment. \u201cThey used to watch the Premier League and see players from different nationalities but never see a Gambian playing,\u201d Barrow says. \u201cSo they\u2019re happy and proud because I\u2019m one of their own.\u201d</p> <p>By the end of that first season, Barrow had made 17 appearances, including four on loan at Nottingham Forest, and found himself at the centre of a tug of war between Sweden and the Gambia. \u201cI was going to play for Sweden at the European Under-21 championship finals in 2015, which they won, but the Gambia was calling me as well,\u201d Barrow says. \u201cIt feels better for me to play for the Gambia because every time I\u2019m there I can have the opportunity to go to my mum\u2019s grave, to visit her and pray for her, and I have family there. So I chose with my heart.\u201d</p> <p>Lean, quick and direct with the ball at his feet, Barrow has showed flashes of real promise over the past 12 months or so, not least in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/15/arsenal-swansea-city-premier-league-match-report\">the 3-2 defeat at Arsenal</a> last month, when he tormented Nacho Monreal in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/03/bob-bradley-american-coach-premier-league-swansea\">Bob Bradley\u2019s first game in charge</a>. The Swansea manager said: \u201cMo\u2019s just scratching the surface. My gosh, this is a player with talent.\u201d</p> <p>Barrow, who turned 24 last month, smiles as he listens to those comments. \u201cHe saw that if I get one against one, it\u2019s hard for the defenders. Monreal is a very good full-back, there is not a lot of people who have the opportunity to run around and pass him every time.\u201d</p> <p>The missing ingredient at the moment is consistency, as Monday\u2019s match at Stoke highlighted, when Barrow had an off night and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/31/stoke-city-swansea-city-premier-league-match-report\">Swansea fell to a 3-1 defeat</a> that leaves them second from bottom and without a win in nine league matches. \u201cYou could see how bad everyone felt after Stoke, we were so depressed and angry,\u201d Barrow says. \u201cBut if we keep playing like we did in the two previous games, I think we can change things.\u201d</p> <p>A victory at home against an out-of-sorts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united\">Manchester United</a> side today would be worth more than three points in terms of the psychological lift it would give everyone at the club. Barrow is looking forward to coming up against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/zlatan-ibrahimovic\">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> \u2013 something he could never have imagined when he first moved to Sweden \u2013 and hoping that his father will be in the mood to chat and tuck into some food afterwards.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s back in the Gambia now and he never misses a game,\u201d says Barrow. \u201cWe chat every day but when I called after the matches against Liverpool and Stoke, he was not in the mood to talk so I spoke to his wife. She told me: \u2018Since the game finished, your dad is not eating anything\u2019. When we lose he doesn\u2019t have any appetite.\u201d</p> <p>Another voice in the room suggests that his father must be starving, given the results this season. \u201cHe\u2019ll eat a lot if we win against Manchester United,\u201d says Barrow, smiling.</p>",
  "<p>There is a rest area on the way into Young in southern New South Wales that has become a makeshift camp for backpackers waiting for the start of the Australian cherry-picking season.</p> <p>At this stage, the campers are young French backpackers, a German and a few Australians on their way somewhere else. The backpackers sleep in their cars, while coffee pots, cups and cereal bowls sit on a camp table. Helene Chaphuif, Brice Lancauchez, Charlotte Loiseau and Romain Quiru are killing time because the cherries are about 10 days late this year.</p> <p>\u201cWe were here last year so we came back because it is pretty good money for picking cherries,\u201d said Chaphuif. \u201cWe can earn A$250 a day [about \u00a3150] for a very big day from 5.30am to 2pm.

Now they are telling friends to go to New Zealand instead.\u201d</p> <p>The issue is red hot because the National Farmers\u2019 Federation (NFF) estimates young backpackers make up 25% of Australia\u2019s agricultural workforce \u2013 for seasonal harvest jobs, like cherry picking, growers say it is much higher.

In a world where every backpacker has a smartphone and is on social media, news of the proposed new tax has travelled like a bush fire. At a senate inquiry into the bill, forced by Labor and the minor parties, the NFF estimated a fall in applications for farm work of between 40% and 90% since the tax increase was proposed..</p> <p>Minor party senator Nick Xenophon said that in his home state of South Australia, tourist operators in the Riverland had struggled to fill backpacker hostels which were fully booked last year. \u201cThat is going to be pretty catastrophic for the bush, for the regions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The president of the NFF, Brent Finlay, told the committee of a mango farm he visited near Humpty Doo in the Northern Territory. \u201cThe mango farmers left 15% of their crop on their trees last year because they did not have enough labour,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cThey were planning to plant another 40,000 trees \u2013 they have the water and they have the infrastructure \u2013 to double the size of their farm, and they won\u2019t go ahead with that work because they know they cannot get a labour force at the current rate.</p> <p>\u201cI have spoken to that farm a number of times this season, and their mango season [began] at the start of August \u2026 They are significantly down [in workers] again this year.\u201d</p> <p>In Tasmania, Australia\u2019s southern-most state, Howard Hansen of Hansen Orchards and Timothy Reid of Reid Fruits are two of the biggest fruit growers and the biggest employers of backpackers in the state.</p> <p>Reid\u2019s company has invested more than A$30m in the business in the past 20 years. In the last financial year, he completed 817 tax statements for employees at the end of the season and 65% were backpackers.</p> <p>\u201cAll of that has been based on the availability of labour in what is a very labour-intensive industry,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe are heavily reliant on backpackers. We have a policy of employing locals first, but there are simply not enough local people, particularly in that peak period when we require harvest.</p> <p>\u201cWe have over 600 people on our farm during harvest. Again, around 65% of them are backpackers. The locals are really good but without the backpackers we do not have a hope.\u201d Hansen said that more than 35% of a payroll worth A$6.5m to A$7m last year went to travellers on working holiday visas. He said the tax plan also threatens the jobs of the Australians who make up the remainder of the workers.</p> <p>\u201cFor more than 25 years, we have used the itinerant labour supply as the spike of labour we need to help harvest the crops,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cIf we cannot harvest the crop, we won\u2019t have a crop to pack for the rest of the year, so we will not need as many Australians. We will not need to maintain orchards; we will not need to prune them; we will not need to make the capital investment. It is not just the jobs of the itinerant people that are at risk; it is the Australians as well.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/01/backpacker-tax-restores-balance-local-workforce-sussan-ley-qanda\">Backpacker tax restores 'balance' with local workforce, Sussan Ley tells Q&amp;A</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Johnson\u2019s agency placed 300 people with local growers last year but she is unsure how many will arrive this time. And if the tax does go ahead, it will require a change mid-harvest.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the [backpackers] that have already started and have done their tax declarations? Do we get a new tax declaration now to override the others as they continue picking?\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe ones flying in and out should be charged the tax rate but the ones that are staying here, that are earning the money to spend on their trip, they will pay their accommodation, get their food and drinks and the money goes back into the community.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the backpackers in Young insist the higher tax plan would not have changed their own travel decisions. \u201cIt would still be better than it is in France,\u201d Chaphuif says. \u201cYes, it not as good as it was but it is still better than in France and it\u2019s easy to get a job.

  "<p>A sharp start to the season, this, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/05/wales-australia-rugby-union-autumn-international-math-report\" title=\"\">a defeat that stung like the autumn weather</a>. Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/24/michael-cheika-allows-all-blacks-and-steve-hansen-to-get-under-his-skin\" title=\"\">had lost seven of the 10 games they had played this season</a>, three to England, three to New Zealand, another to South Africa. There was a thought that they were weaker than they had been in a while but the Wallabies poured cold water all over it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/nov/04/wales-australia-losing-streak-11-matches-michael-cheika\" title=\"\">They have now won their last 12 Tests against Wales</a>, a run started way back in 2008. It already felt like Wales had lost to them in pretty much every which way a team can; undone by penalties, drop goals, and tries in the final minutes, beaten in both tight kicking contests and free-scoring try-fests. But none of the previous 11 defeats were quite like this one.</p> <p>Wales were utterly outplayed and lucky, in the end, to lose by only 24. The game was pretty much up at half-time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/nov/05/wales-v-australia-live-rugby-union\" title=\"\">At that point Australia were leading by 17</a> and could have been many more ahead if they had only been a little more clinical with their finishing. Australia are a conundrum Wales just cannot seem to solve and they have never looked further from figuring it out than they did here, where they did not even seem to understand the question, much less approach an answer. It was the final quarter before something like a competition broke out. But then wing Dane Haylett-Petty scored Australia\u2019s fifth try, sprinting in after sweeping up a loose pass on the halfway line.</p> <p>Despite the best efforts of the Welsh Rugby Union, who laid on a firework show before the start, the atmosphere had been unusually flat throughout. But then for 60 minutes the crowd had precious little to cheer. They roused themselves into a chant when Scott Williams scored their only try, chasing his own grubber kick to the try-line after a good break and even better underhand offload by Hallam Amos. But by time Haylett-Petty dived over the line, thousands had turned their backs and started to walk out. Beating the rush seemed a better idea than enduring any more of the match.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/05/wales-australia-rugby-union-autumn-international-math-report\">Australia dispel rumours of demise with five-try demolition of Wales</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wales showed more wit and skill in that one passage of play by Amos, Webb, and Williams than they did in the entire first half. There are some telling stats for those first 40 minutes: Australia made 90 carries for 400m between them, Wales 30 carries for 30m. Australia had 70% of the possession, and 80% of the territory. One-sided doesn\u2019t cover it. Wales only made two trips into the Australian half, both forays ending in penalty shots at goal, one of which Leigh Halfpenny kicked, the other he missed. Otherwise, they were always back in their own ground, scrambling around trying to patch the gaps in their defence, throwing themselves after all those onrushing Australian runners tearing through their line.</p> <p>Foley was superb, the man of the match. He played the Welsh for fools, made them look like rubes. It was as though he was flicking the ball back and forth underneath three upturned cups. Around him, Australia\u2019s backs, brilliantly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/28/stephen-larkham-aspires-to-wallabies-coaching-job-just-not-quite-yet\" title=\"\">orchestrated by their attack coach, Stephen Larkham</a>, drew the Welsh in with dummy runs and decoy lines, while Foley spat the ball this way and that. Wherever the tacklers were, the ball was not. It had already shifted some place else along the line. Australia should have scored three more. They had two good chances while Dan Biggar was in the sin-bin, one missed when Haylett-Petty knocked on with the line wide open in front of him, another cut short when Halfpenny put in a bone-rattling tackle on Reece&#xa0;Hodge.</p> <p>Wales somehow held themselves together while Biggar was off but as soon as he came back they broke open. Foley\u2019s inside pass put Hodge through on a sharp angle and he then swapped a simple one-two with Israel Folau on the way to the try-line. Tevita Kuridrani scored a third when George North got himself in a tangle backtracking between two oncoming runners. Befuddled by Kuridrani\u2019s dummy, he picked the wrong man to tackle. And Foley himself finished the fourth after a turnover, the try made by a swift pass by the giant lock Adam Coleman. Wales were reeling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/nov/05/wales-v-australia-live-rugby-union\">Wales 8-32 Australia \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They were without Sam Warburton, Taulupe Faletau, and Alun Wyn Jones, as well, of course, as Warren Gatland, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/06/warren-gatland-lions-wales-new-zealand-2017\" title=\"\">who is on sabbatical in the run-up to the Lions tour</a>. It showed. They looked listless and lacked leadership. Until Amos came on for North, they were blunt and bleary, as if caught short by the intensity of the match. Australia, hardened by their recent games in the Rugby Championship, were in a higher gear. Wales have an inexplicably poor record against the southern hemisphere teams for a side who have been so consistently competitive in the Six Nations. Before the match Martyn Williams suggested it was \u201ca mental thing\u201d. In this match their problems were simpler than that.</p> <p>As for Australia, it feels as if they have been underestimated up here in Europe.

By that measure, Cheika\u2019s doing just fine. They look to be in ominously good form at the start of this brutal tour. They play Scotland next week, then France, Ireland, and England.

Sanders rushed out an alert to supporters: \u201cDire news from Wisconsin. A poll released this afternoon has Russ Feingold only up by one point \u2013 meaning he\u2019s in a virtual tie.

This sprawling desert metropolis is in many ways a rebuke to everything that Trump says is wrong with the country. Though it was hit hard by a property boom that turned to bust during the banking crisis, it has a modern and diverse economy and an even more diverse workforce \u2013 swollen by internal and external immigration, as workers move from the rust belt to the sun belt and the population steadily becomes more Hispanic.</p> <p>The state\u2019s other Republican senator, Jeff Flake, was one of the first to distance himself from Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric on immigration.

Wales 8-32 Australia</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A day to forget for Wales and a 12th consecutive loss to Australia</strong>. A bit more fight in the second half and a well-taken try from Scott Williams, but in a cohesive attacking sense, it was dross. Utter dross. Significant backwards steps have been taken since the summer tour in New Zealand. They have a habit of starting autumn campaigns slowly but that\u2019s no excuse for the abject defending, in the first half particularly. Ross Moriarty at least put in a shift and can take a bit of credit, Tipuric too in patches, everyone else \u2026 nope. Not after their heaviest defeat by Australia since 2007 and the heaviest against the Wallabies in Cardiff since 1991.</p> <p><strong>Take nothing away from Australia though</strong>. They were marvellous. They speed, the fluidity with which they attack is a delight to watch. The chasm between the north and south in that sense remains as big as ever. Australia ruled the breakdown and as a result Foley had plenty of front foot ball and he had a field day. That probably doesn\u2019t do him justice \u2013 he was magnificent, at the level he was when ripping England to pieces last year. Outside him Hodge, Kuridrani and Folau also enjoyed themselves and after a difficult year, Australia will be buoyant that their November tour can ensure it finishes on a high.</p> <p><strong>A first Grand Slam since 1984?</strong> That may be getting ahead of ourselves a touch and they did leave plenty of points on the pitch but they will head to Scotland now full of confidence and deservedly so.</p> <p><strong>Next for Wales</strong>, Argentina are the visitors and Howley will hope, pray, that he has Warburton and in particular Liam Williams available. Still, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/05/japan-argentina-international-rugby-union-match-report\">Argentina showed Japan no mercy</a> earlier today and if they are in the mood they can be very difficult to leave with. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ad408fe8a2bb80dc31f2276af944e85e313cf9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ad408fe8a2bb80dc31f2276af944e85e313cf9c/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dejected Wales captain Gethin Jenkins leads his team off the pitch following their 32-8 defeat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dejected Wales captain Gethin Jenkins leads his team off the pitch following their 32-8 defeat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T16:41:29.417Z\">at 4.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581e05ace4b07ceadb3a2c23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T16:18:03.451Z\">4.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>80 mins:</strong> Quade Cooper is on and flicks an inside pass.

  "<p>The US is not the only western nation to be undergoing political ructions over the faltering post-crisis recovery. New counter-establishment parties have emerged in several countries and, as in the UK, people have voted for dramatic change. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a growing sense in developed economies that workers have yet to benefit from the recovery or rising globalisation.</p> <h2><strong>Germany</strong><br></h2> <p>Germany\u2019s economy has largely outperformed the wider eurozone in recent years. Its unemployment rate is low and youth unemployment is the lowest in EU. But not everyone feels they are getting the benefits of Germany\u2019s stand-out performance. Wage growth has been relatively modest, and anger has intensified recently over meagre returns on savings as the European Central Bank cut key interest rates into negative territory. That has exacerbated grievances some Germans have long held over the euro, a union they feel benefits poorer countries more than their own.</p> <p>Animosity towards the single currency was behind the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/19/frauke-petry-acceptable-face-of-germany-new-right-interview\" title=\"\">founding of the populist Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party in 2013</a>.

Ministers have repeatedly hailed Britain\u2019s rising employment and relatively strong economic growth, but a quick look behind the headline figures explains why such boasts have been met with disbelief by many. Employment is up, but a significant driver of this gain has been self-employment and other forms of insecure work such as zero-hours contracts, and employers have continued to rely on low-paid labour rather than investing to grow. A recent study by the Trades Union Congress,the umbrella body for British unions, found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/27/uk-joins-greece-at-bottom-of-wage-growth-league-tuc-oecd\" title=\"\">Britain suffered a bigger fall in real wages since the financial crisis than any other advanced country apart from Greece</a>.</p> <h2>France<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a8daab149992ed3104290e48a76acb4eadbd9a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a8daab149992ed3104290e48a76acb4eadbd9a9/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marine Le Pen poster\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marine Le Pen has seen support grow with anti-globalisation and anti-euro feeling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Ena/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Years on from the financial crisis, many French people feel they are not sharing in the recovery. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/francois-hollande\" title=\"\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande</a> has come under fire for his handling of the economy and is France\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/08/hollande-sets-out-stall-for-french-elections-with-attack-on-identity-politics\" title=\"\">least popular president on record</a>.

But there is a feeling among many workers that their lives have become bleaker as high inflation erodes household incomes, while companies fared better thanks to state support and a weak rouble.</p> <p>This squeeze on the working classes has not manifested itself in the kind of new populist movements seen in EU countries. Russia expert Charles Movit at consultancy IHS Economics says: \u201cThe media is totally controlled by the state in Russia and the tradition of strong leaders is ingrained.

  "<p>The decline of traditional US industries has formed the backdrop to Donald Trump\u2019s central pledge to \u201cmake America great again\u201d. It has also energised the support of a former mainstay of the Democrat vote, the white working class. Five key sectors in particular have suffered since their heydays in the previous century.</p> <h2><strong>Manufacturing</strong></h2> <p>Fewer than one in 10 Americans work in manufacturing, compared to one in four in 1960. While Nafta (the North American Free Trade Agreement) is often blamed for shipping American manufacturing jobs south of the border to Mexico, the number of employees in manufacturing actually increased in the US after it was enacted in 1994. But economists argue that China joining the World Trade Organisation in 2001 has had the biggest impact on American manufacturing jobs by flooding the US with cheap imports that have knocked out homemade goods.</p> <h2><strong>Coal mining</strong><br></h2> <p>Coal has had an ill-fated recent history in the US, as momentum has grown around a push for renewable energy. Employment peaked in the 1920s, when almost half a million people worked in the coal mines. But those jobs were shed over the ensuing decades as improvements in technology made mines more efficient. Nevertheless, US coal production had grown continuously up until its peak in 2008. Since then, production has dropped as the government has steadily phased out more coal energy plants in favour of renewable power such as wind and solar.</p> <h2><strong>Steel</strong></h2> <p>The US industry has collapsed due to competition from cheap overseas steel. Production of American steel peaked in the 1970s, and its decline was accelerated by the 2008 financial crisis. The situation has been made worse by the slowdown of the oil industry \u2013 a heavy user of steel. Automation has been a key driver of job losses, however.</p> <h2><strong>Textiles</strong></h2> <p>America used to make a lot of its own clothes, but the signing of trade deals and much cheaper labour costs overseas have led to the majority of clothing companies sending production offshore. In the 1960s, approximately 95% of clothing worn in the US was made domestically, according to the American Apparel &amp; Footwear Association. Now, 97% of clothing and 98% of shoes sold in the US are made overseas. The trend is set to continue, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics ranks clothing, leather, and allied manufacturing as the most rapidly declining industry in the US. The bureau forecast the industry to decline by -5.9% between 2014 and 2024.</p> <h2><strong>Cars</strong></h2> <p>America was the world\u2019s leading automotive manufacturer in the early 1900s, when technology created the era of mass production. Annual sales of American cars peaked in 1978 at 12.9m but declined to 7m in 1982, as Japan usurped the US as the world\u2019s leading car producer. Car sales were also hit in the 2000s by a sustained increase in petrol prices. This left General Motors and Chrysler poorly positioned to handle the recession in 2008 and needing an $85bn (\u00a368bn) government bailout. Since 2010, the American automotive industry has rebounded, adding jobs consistently.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 7 November 2016 to correct the byline.

So, surely, engaging an architectural practice south of the border to oversee the project would be politic?</p> <p>That\u2019s the thinking behind the Mexican architectural practice Estudio 314\u2019s proposal, which offers a distinctly Latin take on the Republican wall. A team of seven interns working under 314\u2019s creative director, Leonardo D\u00edaz Borioli and Hassanaly Ladha from the American experimental design lab the Mamertine Group, reimagined the border proposal in the spirit of the great 20th-century Mexican architect Luis Barrag\u00e1n.</p> <p>Barrag\u00e1n, who won the Pritzker prize in 1980 and died in 1988 at the age of 86, was known for combining simple, modernist designs with lyrical, spiritual flourishes, employing bright pinks, as well as other startling pastel shades, in his otherwise restrained works.</p> <p>Estudio 314\u2019s rendering adopts a Barrag\u00e1n colour scheme with an equally faithful lack of ornament, though the studio has a little fun with other features in this imaginative, uncommissioned proposal. This wall also encloses \u201ca prison where 11 million undocumented people will be processed, classified, indoctrinated, and/or deported\u201d, the studio explains, making reference to Trump\u2019s immigration plans. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5eb776a82142d8945230c01e3e9aa686e123ebd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eb776a82142d8945230c01e3e9aa686e123ebd6/0_333_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Interior view of the house and studio of Mexican architec Luis Barragan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Interior view of the house and studio of the Mexican architect Luis Barrag\u00e1n.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At other points, the wall could also accommodate a shopping mall, or even an observation terrace, where would-be migrants might look upon, but not touch, the Land of the Free.</p> <p>Of course the architectural practice, which is based in Barrag\u00e1n\u2019s birthplace of Guadalajara, does not sincerely believe its pink wall will break ground anytime soon. Instead, 314, which is more used to working on hospitality and public-park commissions, hopes its proposal will \u201callow the public to imagine the policy proposal in all of its gorgeous perversity\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/donald-trump-links-mexico-border-wall-plan-to-israels-successful-separation-barrier\">Donald Trump links Mexico border wall plan to Israel's 'successful' separation barrier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBecause the wall has to be beautiful, it has been inspired by Luis Barrag\u00e1n\u2019s pink walls that are emblematic of Mexico,\u201d says 314, adding: \u201cIt also takes advantage of the tradition in architecture of megalomaniac wall building.\u201d</p> <p>Well, quite. And while Barrag\u00e1n may have approved of the pigmentation and the clean lines, there\u2019s very little else likely to endear the scheme to the late Pritzker laureate, including the flamboyantly haired client north of the border and his swingeing terms of payment.</p> <p>As the architecture critic Jonathan Glancey put it in a 2001 article, Barrag\u00e1n was a generous man. \u201cWhen he was asked to rebuild and extend a convent in Tlalpan not far from his own home, he paid for the extra work needed to give the resident nuns a special design far and above what they had expected. The result was a sensual, spiritual place influenced by the Court of the Myrtles at the Alhambra.\u201d</p> <p>It seems unlikely that, in years to come, anyone will be choosing similar words to describe this wall or its chief commissioner, no matter what the colour.</p>",

  "<p>Out on Route 21 in Washington state, the long golden prairies of wheat stretch out on either side of the road, lapping against distant purplish mountain ranges. Abandoned farms dot the landscape: gaunt timber-framed skeletons, their owners given up and gone to California or Seattle. I even spy a lone grey wolf, standing and staring at my passing car. He must have come across from Canada, heading south for winter maybe.</p> <p>Some of the towns are no longer alive, but <strong>Pomeroy</strong>, in the south-east of the state, shows signs of hope. There\u2019s a great bookshop where the owner, John, swears things are on the up. \u201cDon\u2019t call us Pomeranians though. That\u2019s a dog.\u201d</p> <p>I tell him about my quest: a search for the perfect funky small American town, a place with a buzzing homespun coffee shop and a great little deli, a town with some youthful exuberance and a shared passion for the great outdoors \u2013 plus, of course, friendly bookshops such as his.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/travel_us_road_trip/giv-1406o78bsB5bcPjP/\" data-alt=\"US north-west map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/travel_us_road_trip/giv-1406o78bsB5bcPjP/\">US north-west map</a> </figure>  <p>To me, those towns are where America is at its best. It\u2019s the new American dream. It seems particularly appropriate that I\u2019m doing this in the middle of a vicious election battle between two very different visions of America. John swears that Pomeroy is heading for success, but after a look around town I can see the battle is not quite won. I mark Pomeroy as a \u201cmaybe\u201d.</p> <p>Alternative funky towns of America. I\u2019d spent the previous year compiling a list of possible locations. After I discovered a rich seam of internet discussion on the subject, my list had grown inordinately long and covered almost every state in the union. But what stood out was that north-west corner: northern California, Oregon, Idaho and Washington. The area was obviously catnip to people who wanted something more from life than can be bought in Walmart. I drew lines on the road atlas. I discounted the cities \u2013 Portland and Seattle \u2013 too big and well-known. I caught a plane to San Francisco. I got on Highway 101. I went north.</p> <p>That first night I made it as far as the Benbow Inn near <strong>Garberville</strong>, on the cusp of redwood country. Next morning, I had breakfast in the <a href=\"http://www.thewoodrosecafe.com/\">Woodrose Caf\u00e9</a> and decided that all my towns would need somewhere just like this: a busy little diner serving kickstart-the-day food for lumberjacks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f16aadb9793f15b81a4affc2ba2adf2ab1e71642\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f16aadb9793f15b81a4affc2ba2adf2ab1e71642/0_0_960_720/500.jpg\" alt=\"Breakfast at The Woodrose Cafe, Garberville\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breakfast at The Woodrose Cafe, Garberville</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Woodrose Cafe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But why, I asked my neighbour at the counter, were there so many grubby guitar-packing youths sitting by the gas station with cardboard signs that read: Garden Work Needed. \u201cThat\u2019s a specialised form of garden work they\u2019re wanting,\u201d he told me with a wink, and when I still didn\u2019t twig, he explained that Garberville is the capital of Californian marijuana culture. \u201cGardening here is paradise for stoners.\u201d</p> <p>Weed had not been on my list of requirements for the new utopia, but a decent bookshop was: preferably a place in which to sink into a period armchair with a good guide to American ghost towns. I love American ghost towns: after all, they are the shadows behind those rejuvenated places. Garberville has such a bookshop (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tiger-Lily-Books/160873477267058\">Tiger Lily Books</a>), but the town\u2019s real attraction lies to the north along what is known as Avenue of the Giants.</p> <p>The overpowering physical presence of a redwood forest is shocking: imagine picking your way through a million Big Bens standing a few feet apart. North of Garberville, the highway plunges into a deep sombre cathedral of trees that goes on and on. I emerged at <strong>Eureka</strong>, a coastal town known for its seafood and Victorian architecture. I checked in at <a href=\"http://carterhouse.com/\">Carter House Inn</a> (doubles from $189 B&amp;B), one of the lovelier old buildings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9a3071902c60d36e46a16c192adc253d2398d799\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a3071902c60d36e46a16c192adc253d2398d799/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walking in the forest just off the Avenue of the Giants, northern California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Walking in the forest just off the Avenue of the Giants, northern California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Funky cafes? I spotted a few. Bookshops? Three. It was looking hopeful. There was a bustling marina where gangs of seals and gulls were awaiting the next tuna boat. There were some good restaurants and bars. In one, the Oberon Grill (516 2nd Street), I found a framed newspaper story from 1911 describing how Jack London had got into a fist fight in that very place.</p> <p>Eureka has gentrified a lot since then, but still has a colourful edge that harks back to pioneer days. In the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/speakeasyeureka/\">Speakeasy Bar</a> that evening I heard tales of Bigfoot sightings and monster trees. I gave Eureka a large tick on my list.

I pressed on, however, crossing into Oregon on Highway 199, <a href=\"http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byways/\">one of the US\u2019s 120 national scenic byways</a>.</p> <p>My objective that night was a treehouse B&amp;B outside Cave Junction, but arriving in the area after dark my GPS failed and, inexplicably, my phone too. I pulled in to a gas station and found myself taking directions from a customer with a teardrop tattoo under one eye \u2013 the mark of a murderer I seemed to remember \u2013 and feeling like I had wandered into a Coen brothers film. Four hours later, having explored every backcountry road for miles, I finally rolled up at <a href=\"http://www.treehouseparadise.com/\">Treehouse Paradise</a> (rooms for two from $350). By flashlight I was shown the footpath to my treehouse which proved to be a luxurious den high up in a Douglas fir.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"65e91c5f45128d845c178c365cd96a46ea3a026a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65e91c5f45128d845c178c365cd96a46ea3a026a/0_761_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Treehouse Paradise B&amp;B, Cave Junction, Oregon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Treehouse Paradise B&amp;B, Cave Junction, Oregon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At dawn I was woken by skittering noises and peeped out to see three deer chasing each other around the base of the tree. Down in the main house the owner, Phil, was cooking breakfast. \u201cI came up here from southern California 38 years ago,\u201d he told me, \u201cWe grew up surfing, climbing and hunting. But then it got very crowded down there. I wouldn\u2019t go back.\u201d</p> <p>Phil and Jodie, his wife, had constructed an idyllic retreat. After arriving, they decided never to shoot anything on their land and soon transformed it into a haven for wildlife and birds \u2013 hence my experience of the deer that morning. Phil\u2019s breakfast was near perfect too: a feast of fresh fruit and home cooking. \u201cWe are pretty self-sufficient out here,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you tried my blueberry jam?\u201d</p> <p>A week in the treehouse would have suited me just fine, but instead I set out again, cutting inland towards Idaho, passing through attractive little towns along the Rogue river. After Crater Lake and Bend I turned east on Highway 20, passing an astonishing dwarf forest of whitebark pines before the road became bleaker and emptier and finally sought sanctuary in a long shallow canyon that burrowed its way into Idaho, emerging on Interstate 84, which took me south to <strong>Boise</strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7e004fa0fe14587aee62429cccc43911c30e5304\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e004fa0fe14587aee62429cccc43911c30e5304/0_494_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Boise, Idaho\u2019s capital\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Downtown Boise, Idaho\u2019s capital with a small town vibe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This city interested me. In the 1970s, a Hewlett Packard exec, Ray Smelek, was tasked with finding the best company HQ and location in the US. He selected Boise (pronounced boy-see), reasoning that you could ski in the morning and play golf all afternoon. Since then the place has boomed, but retained a small town feel.</p> <p>I met up with a local climbing guide, Randall, and got his take on it. \u201cI like Boise,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut it\u2019s too big and too white to be perfect.\u201d He listed his criteria for a small town. \u201cMountains nearby, and some young professionals, but a diverse culture, and not too bourgie. Somewhere like Ketchum \u2013 mind you, that can get pretty bumpin\u2019 in winter.\u201d</p> <p>We unpicked this slowly. Ketchum is a ski town in Idaho, much loved by the wealthy (the bourgeois) who have those great (bumpin\u2019) parties.</p> <p>I, too, liked Boise, despite its size. It boasts the largest Basque community outside Spain, which brings an unexpected dimension to its tidy grid-iron streets. There\u2019s a burgeoning wine industry with tasting rooms, several craft breweries and some great restaurants (try <a href=\"http://www.goldysbreakfastbistro.com/\">Goldy\u2019s</a> for breakfast).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"45558c54d7d7d29a7123908e0aebc90cd2722a98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45558c54d7d7d29a7123908e0aebc90cd2722a98/0_471_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sawtooth Hotel in Stanley, Idaho.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There\u2019s a frontier feel to the Sawtooth Hotel in Stanley, Idaho.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After a couple of nights, however, I had to admit that Boise was just too big for perfection. I drove on, sweeping on a huge curve through Idaho, stopping frequently to admire the mountain panoramas. I liked <strong>Stanley</strong>, deep inside the Sawtooth mountains, and especially the <a href=\"http://sawtoothhotel.com/\">Sawtooth Hotel</a> (rooms from $70) with its genuine frontier feel. But Stanley suffers severe winters and even in September the nights were frosty.</p> <p>I cut north-west, luxuriating in roadside hot springs Sunbeam and Kirkham\u2019s, then passing Hells Canyon and arriving at <strong>Joseph</strong> \u2013 one of Oregon\u2019s strong contenders for the alternative funky town title. Once a typical logging and ranching outpost, Joseph has reinvented itself as an arts town, with a speciality in bronze-casting.</p> <p>I wandered around, noting a great little pizza oven place, a bookshop and a cafe \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.redhorsecoffeetraders.com/\">Red Horse</a>, a real treat. There were deer tiptoeing across the lawns of clapboard houses and a very friendly visitor centre. \u201cA good hike is up Hurricane Creek,\u201d they told me. \u201cFolks say there\u2019s a cabin of an old-time gold prospector up there still exactly as he left it. Nothing\u2019s been moved.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bda03c3d57c5f9a40adb22649c642541ef7ca252\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bda03c3d57c5f9a40adb22649c642541ef7ca252/0_10_5400_3241/1000.jpg\" alt=\"agricultural landscape near Pomeroy, Washington State\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farming today \u2026 agricultural landscape near Pomeroy, Washington State.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019d have liked a week to enjoy Joseph and hunt down that cabin, but the road was calling me. I headed north to the Snake river, then turning west, spotting my wolf and visiting Pomeroy. It made me wonder: how are those small towns made? The common theme of the successful places I\u2019d seen seemed to be a handful of hardy young entrepreneurs, the sort who can make their own clothes, granola and business plans at the same time as snowboarding the local mountains or debugging a laptop: the cool tycoons.</p> <p>My next stop was <strong>Bellingham</strong>, right up near the Canadian border. I was running out of US and I still hadn\u2019t quite found perfection although, for the first time, I was coming across Trump posters \u2013 none for Hilary. The <a href=\"http://www.treefrognight.com/\">Tree Frog Night Inn</a> (doubles from $100) where I stayed, definitely had the right vibe, as did the <a href=\"http://www.aslanbrewing.com/\">Aslan Brewery</a>, where all the beers were excellent and the tycoons definitely cool. Bellingham, however, was just too big to take the title. Next day I turned tail and hared back south, popping over the bridge to <strong>Anacortes</strong> on Fidalgo Island.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b21a0f709e5e3e2d455f69734ced9279450e98b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b21a0f709e5e3e2d455f69734ced9279450e98b2/0_0_5079_3386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Antiques store in Anacortes, Washington\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Antiques store in Anacortes, Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Truth is, this wasn\u2019t even on my list. I just liked the name. And when I saw it, I was in love. Any town that has large ships being built on its beach cannot be bad. Plus they had bookshops, cafes and complimentary pianos on street corners. Yes, overstrung, gaudily painted, honky tonk joannas for passersby to hammer out jazz standards on, which \u2013 naturally \u2013 many appeared to be able to do. Big tick for Anacortes, especially when I saw orcas in large numbers out in the bay.</p> <p>These islands have some other good contenders, I realised. On Whidbey Island there was <strong>Langley</strong>, with a fine coffee shop, <a href=\"http://uselessbaycoffee.com/\">Useless Bay Coffee Co</a>, and <strong>Coupville</strong>, with its glorious old high street and wonderful Captain Whidbey Inn.</p> <p>Time was running out, I had only one more destination. I caught the ferry west to the Olympic peninsula and pulled in at <strong>Port Townsend</strong>. I got off the boat and walked around and knew I\u2019d found it. There were cafes, bars, bookshops and great architecture. There was the ocean and the mountains. It had it all. And it was mine. Except I had no time.

Camilleri named his detective in honour of the Spanish writer and intellectual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/oct/21/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries1\">Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalban</a>, who created his own gastronome-private eye in Pepe Carvalho, a weary, sardonic Catalan with a penchant for rice dishes and a good recipe for fish stew.

The ultimate comfort reads, they give you a murder, a solution and most important of all, recipes; the detectives are chefs (in one case the White House\u2019s chef \u2013 the book gives you all you need for your own presidential dinner), or tea shop owners or chocoholics or cake obsessives, full of practical good sense and advice on barbecue techniques.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For detectives, food provides a civilised and nostalgic relief from the horrors of work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I, too, have recently succumbed. My latest book, <em>The Devil\u2019s Feast</em>, features a Victorian celebrity chef (the real life culinary prodigy Alexis Soyer), several long meals and some very painful deaths. It\u2019s caused me to reflect on why food is such an effective and pleasurable adjunct to crime writing and what function it serves in these books.</p> <p>One thing good crime novels give you, along with the puzzle of the crime, is a world. It might be Maigret\u2019s mid-century France,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/28/ian-rankin-rebus-edinburgh-street\"> Rebus\u2019s Edinburgh</a>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/29/lamentation-cj-sansom-review-sixth-tudor-mystery-shardlake\"> Shardlake</a>\u2019s Tudor England or Carvalho\u2019s Spain (Montalban was explicit in his desire to describe contemporary Spain and all its faults). They open up the life and social habits of the world they investigate. Good food writing does the same thing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/roland-barthes\">Roland Barthes</a> wrote, \u201can entire world is present in and signified by food\u201d. In crime writing, descriptions of food immediately add texture, authenticity and three-dimensionality. They are a kind of shorthand. Look, they say, this world is real, the glasses are chipped and the shiny hot bacon fat sheens the plates, even if the crime is far-fetched. They also reach out beyond the crime and its investigation. The writer Jason Goodwin, whose investigator Yashim is a eunuch and a keen cook at the 19th century Ottoman court, has written, \u201cYou uncover a place in the scent of a dish, more absolutely than in a thousand words.\u201d This is never more clear than in the Maigret novels, where the inspector learns the world of the crime and its secrets by eating, inhaling the atmosphere of grubby basement bars and shabby bistros, knocking back a small glass of marc, accepting a plate of roast lamb and a few leaves bathed in a garlic dressing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"281d5180cc78c075e57d70984ebf4bcbfce64b13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/281d5180cc78c075e57d70984ebf4bcbfce64b13/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luca Zingaretti Montalbano\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luca Zingaretti in an Italian adaptation of Montalbano.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Food also defines, elaborates \u2013 and humanises \u2013 character. \u201cSherlock Holmes played the violin. I cook,\u201d said Carvalho. But cooking and eating is more than just a habit. It is in food \u2013 along with sex \u2013 that Carvalho finds respite from the politics and corruption that he so jadedly observes. Holmes\u2019s tea blend suggests light eccentricity, while his hearty diet is one of the few respects in which he is similar to his gentleman creator Conan Doyle. The eunuch Yashim\u2019s precise pleasure in cooking demonstrates a fastidious, agile mind. The fact that, in the exaggeratedly gendered world of the Ottoman court, he cooks at all reminds us how he bestrides both male and female worlds and possesses a unique perspective wider than the rest. For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jul/06/andrea-camilleri-montalbano-life-in-writing\">Montalbano</a> too, food provides a civilised and nostalgic relief from the horrors of his work. Food resonates with the past: as he reaches into the fridge for his dinner, he remembers being a little boy on the Sicilian festival of All Souls\u2019 Day, and reaching excitedly and nervously into the traditional wicker basket of sweet treats \u201cwhich the dead had left \u2026 during the night\u201d (<em>The Terracotta Dog</em>). And he prefers to eat alone, as if for all his humour and levity, he trusts more to the comfort of food than the uncertainties of human relationships. Even Sam Spade, in choosing John\u2019s Grill, shows he has his finger on the city\u2019s pulse and is not bereft of a little class.</p> <p>It\u2019s a peculiarity of these books that food and eating rarely progress the plot. Descriptions of eating or cooking are dropped coolly into the action, and suspend it. There\u2019s a current orthodoxy in certain kinds of crime and thriller writing that a book is a dash to the edge of the volcano crater, action and tension upon action and tension. But that\u2019s not the whole story \u2013 look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/lee-child\">Lee Child</a>, who doesn\u2019t do food but does do plenty of description. These moments of digression let air into the plot. They give a necessary beat, a breath, a lull. They pull back from the blood and chaos. They re-establish the world around the crime. They even create more suspense, as the reader is diverted and waits for the next breakthrough. I wonder too, if there is not some similarity in the rhythms of good crime writing and good food writing. Many crime novelists have written about food, among them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jul/22/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\">Freeling</a>, Montalban and the thriller writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/14/len-deighton-observer-cookstrips-michael-caine-1960s\">Len Deighton</a>. Both require precision and an abjuring of over-wordiness.</p> <p>Food, as inevitable as death, is the perfect digression in these books: it is the natural counter, a tangible weapon, against the disruption and chaos of murder and violence. (Of course, sex is another fundamental too, but sex scenes that aren\u2019t cliched, wince-making or offensively titillating are rare.) \u201cDining is the privilege of civilisation,\u201d Mrs Beeton wrote. As these investigators cook and eat they assert life, reason and thought. And though food is fallow time from the plot, the implication is that it is tied up with intelligence, cogitation and therefore the resolution of the story. The elephantine Nero Wolfe will not allow cases to be discussed while he eats, but when he ponders and solves in his chair with his eyes closed, his lips push in and out as if he\u2019s chewing. Maigret solves cases like he eats, immersing his senses, almost savouring.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f580e7e2f3bb05407aa2947449ef7be1eef98f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f580e7e2f3bb05407aa2947449ef7be1eef98f4/0_118_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rowan Atkinson  Inspector Maigret\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rowan Atkinson as Inspector Maigret.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin Hutton/PR Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s appropriate then, that in the main the classic hard-boiled American crime novel is usually food-free. American detectives live off salt, fast food, grease and caffeine; in their world things move too fast for a sit-down dinner. The implication is that fine food is decadent. This is particularly the case with tough female investigators who establish their fitness to walk the mean streets by having no domestic talents or interests. Thus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/18/sue-grafton-childhood-ended-when-five\">Sue Grafton</a>\u2019s Kinsey Millhone cuts her hair with nail scissors and lives off McDonald\u2019s and KFC.</p> <p>What we see less of these days is crime fiction that subverts the safe rituals of eating, where the civilised becomes the vehicle of savagery. Poisoning barely features in contemporary crime writing, no doubt because forensics and detection are so good these days, and poisoning feels too Grand Guignol (though lashings of elaborately described torture, blood and guts apparently do not). Hannibal Lecter, so profoundly unsettling because of the complete lack of contradiction he sees in being a civilised epicure while giving full rein to his darkest urges, is a rare and powerful example.</p> <p>This is surprising, as some of the oldest roots of crime-writing \u2013 in the new popular newspapers that sprung up in the early 1840s, such as Lloyd\u2019s Weekly and the News of the World \u2013 were intertwined with the subversion of food. These newspapers, which devoted half their space to crime and murder, arrived at the beginning of what\u2019s been called the golden age of Victorian poisoning, as chemists began to develop reliable tests to detect poison and the perpetrators began to stand trial.</p> <p>There were 98 poisoning trials in Britain during the 1840s and the papers covered them in breathless, gleeful detail. Some of the most prominent involved women knocking off husbands, children, lodgers and lovers by adding arsenic and strychnine (cheap and easy to get) to porridge, coffee and soup. In 1843 alone two women were hanged for multiple domestic poisonings. Elizabeth Eccles for killing her five children and a stepson (she was suspected of poisoning five earlier children); and Sarah Dazeley for killing two husbands and her son. The subversion of the domestic hearth and pot made the stories sinister indeed. Maybe, after all, some stories are too dark for novels.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Devil\u2019s Feast</em> by Miranda Carter is published by Fig Tree.

The company\u2019s healthcare costs increased by 14% following the introduction of Obama\u2019s signature healthcare policy, the Affordable Care Act. A rule that covers the dependent children of insured workers up to the age of 26, touted as a boon for parents of college kids, has also led to the coverage of many of her workers\u2019 adult offspring even though they are not in school. If those legal adults don\u2019t have their own coverage, they turn to their parents\u2019 insurance. The average number of dependents on War Fab\u2019s insurance in 2012 was 2.2; in 2016 it is almost 4.9, and some of the ensuing costs have had to be passed on to workers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/unemployment-obama/\" data-alt=\"unemployment chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/unemployment-obama/\">unemployment chart</a> </figure>  <p>The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to dig its way out of the last recession with record low interest rates has also hurt War Fab.

But the EMicro One is a scooter with a motor, and a different beast; when you reach 5km an hour, the electric motor kicks in, then you are in a truly new transport space, somewhere between a three-year-old and a person with a mobility buggy.

  "<p>Dear women of America and men who love women,</p> <p>All week I have received emails, texts and calls from my sisters around the world. They were as diverse as you get \u2013 sisters in Congo fighting an epidemic of rape and brutality, and sisters in Iceland striking across the country protesting pay inequity. Sisters in Kenya fighting against genital cutting, and sisters in Iraq building safe houses as fast as women are being taken and enslaved. Again and again there was one panicked question: is it possible that Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/barack-obama-samantha-bee-halloween-episode-trump\">could become president</a> of the United States?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I want us to declare we are united and will never elect an assaulting, insulting, disgusting man to lead our nation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They are all trying to make sense of how a man like this could be on the brink of becoming the most powerful person in the world. A man who has openly admitted and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">bragged</a> that he can grab women without consent by their genitalia. A man who has now been accused by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations\">numerous women</a> of harassment or assault. A man who is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-alleged-rape-lawsuit\">fending off a lawsuit</a> from a woman who claimed she was raped by him as a 13-year-old. A man who has an ex-wife who claimed in a divorce deposition that he raped her. A man who appears to project his own sexual predation on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">fictional Mexican rapists</a> and innocent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york\">African American youth</a>.</p> <p>My sisters wanted me to remind American women that this election is our election. Yes, we could have the first woman president. But more importantly this election will determine whether we stand against blatant misogyny, or whether we reward it. It is an election which has unleashed the subculture of sexual violence in America \u2013 and that could be our breakthrough, or our breakdown.</p> <p>They reminded me that next Tuesday, we have the power to direct this moment of truth. We as women have such difficulty believing that how we are seen and treated could be the central criteria for judging our candidates. Patriarchy has normalized our suffering, and made us terrified about speaking up. How often do we excuse the most oppressive, denigrating behavior of male leaders, because we believe there is something more important? We as woman often put everything else before ourselves.</p> <p>But this time it should be different. The truth despite the differences between us is that we are 50% of the population of the world. Women do two-thirds of the work of the world but get paid 10% of the income. If we were to start tomorrow refusing to nurse, serve, clean, teach, nanny, mother, organize, create, lead, support, sell, arrange, the world would come to a complete halt. Everything would crumble.</p> <p>There are an endless list of reasons not to vote for Donald Trump. By contrast, Hillary Clinton \u2013 for all her real flaws \u2013 is a woman who knows what it feels like to be hurt and humiliated by a womanizer. If we choose Trump and not her, all our years of struggle will be for naught. The culture under a Trump will be a Doris Lessing-esque nightmare. I don\u2019t want to spend the next four years using their language, playing in the cesspool of their degradation. I get to determine my own identity. I am done being traumatized.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/11/white-people-racism-america\">It's time for white people to reckon with racism | Eve Ensler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You don\u2019t have to trust Hillary Clinton.

If, once she has settled in office, Hillary Clinton does not move to implement our collective vision, we will rise and push her ceaselessly at every front. With Trump, there is no front. It\u2019s scorched earth. There is only a hate-filled man and the haters around him, the haters he will grow and give permission to \u2013 who have already let us know in no uncertain terms that they will assault, degrade, deny, diminish and destroy us and our rights.<br></p> <p>If we send Trump back to his gross phallic tower, we will be saying we want these horrifying woman-hating days to be over forever. Defeating him will give us ground to fight the last dirty gasp of the patriarchy which is built on a conviction that subordinated people must stay in their assigned place. So much of the fury that Trump has unleashed is because all too many of us are perceived as breaking the chains of a society built on gender and race hierarchies. I want this to be the moment where all of us who identify as women say what happens to us is the bellwether of the future of life on this planet, and must be heeded. This is our world. I want us to declare we are united and will never elect an assaulting, insulting, disgusting degrading man to lead our nation \u2013 and we will ever let another one like him get this far.

The last days of the Calais refugee camp</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Camp officials would not release the precise number of inhabitants and the formal position is that the site is closed to newcomers. But volunteers distributing food and aid say there has been a sharp rise in the number of people arriving and note that huts designed to accommodate four people are often housing twice as many.</p> <p>Christian Salom\u00e9, the president of refugee charity L\u2019Auberge des Migrants, who has been working on the issue for the past 24 years, said clearing the Calais camp did not mean the crisis was over. \u201cIt will come again. about 97% of the people who come are fleeing war, and those wars continue, particularly in Iraq. Until the demolition, 40 people were arriving every day. They will continue to come,\u201d he said.</p> <p>This week, there was a heavy police presence guarding motorways around Calais, and police in Paris were making checks on people without papers trying to board trains and buses for northern France. But Salom\u00e9 expects a surge in the number of people arriving in Calais a month from now, by which time the 6,000 taken by bus to temporary accommodation last week have been told they must move on, either by claiming asylum or returning home.</p> <p>Although the Calais camp has been demolished, it is not possible to extinguish the desire many refugees have to travel to the UK, Salom\u00e9 said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want to claim asylum in France, they will have to leave the centres. They can\u2019t be deported back to their countries if there is a war there. There is no possibility for them to work in France. They will continue to come to Calais,\u201d he said.</p> <p>For the moment, refugees who chose not to take buses to French reception centres are at pains to stay hidden from authorities. The camp in the ditch is remote enough to avoid the attention of police. The Afghans who live there have no desire to claim asylum in France.</p> <p>\u201cIn Paris, I saw people who have been given 10 years leave to remain in France, who are still sleeping in the park and sitting outside churches asking for money. That\u2019s not a life,\u201d Sattar said. His belief that he stands a better chance of working in the UK has fuelled his determination to return. So far, he has twice climbed into lorries on the motorway, but was discovered at the port both times.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a2062655de5990971e0b410ac217b472475f862\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a2062655de5990971e0b410ac217b472475f862/0_198_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People play football at a government-approved refugee camp near Dunkirk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People play football at a government-approved refugee camp near Dunkirk. Many choose to hide from authorities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sattar is very attached to England. \u201cIn Reading, I had the best time of my life. I grew up there,\u201d he said. After college he got a job at a poultry factory in Birmingham. \u201cIt was a very good job,\u201d he said. Sattar has not told his family in Afghanistan that he has had to leave Britain.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt would break their hearts. Whenever I call them, I say I am safe, having a good life,\u201d he said. But living in the ditch could not accurately be described as such. \u201cIt\u2019s not good here. When it rains, your clothes get wet, it\u2019s muddy everywhere,\u201d he said, warming himself against the cold, sitting by a small open fire made of branches collected from nearby woods.</p> <p>He has also not told his foster family or friends where he is. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make them upset. They think I am in Birmingham,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody knows what I went through and what I am going through.\u201d Sattar despairs at the UK asylum system, which first embraced and then expelled him.</p> <p>But his situation is not particularly unusual. Namitullah Echkzei, 23, from Kunduz in Afghanistan, came to Britain as a child refugee and was educated at Waltham Forest college in north-east London. He is also living in the dip between the fields. His brother was granted asylum in the UK, but for reasons he does not fully understand, his application was not accepted.</p> <p>\u201cThe Taliban threatened our family. We faced the same problems. They rejected me, but my brother was accepted,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say it is safe, but Kunduz is not safe.\u201d He is also hoping to return to the UK, to the flat where his brother lives in Walthamstow, to contest the decision.</p> <p>Doctors of the World makes weekly visits to the ditch to see how people are coping. Staff at the charity regularly have to take people from the camp to hospital with broken bones and sprains, particularly ankles and wrists, the result of falls from moving lorries during their night-time attempts to get to the UK.</p> <p>Food is distributed by local volunteers. The men, some of whom have been living here for a year, look unhealthy and exhausted, and complain of brutal treatment at the hands of police whenever they are picked up near the motorway. \u201cWe had our own lives in Afghanistan, we had families, houses, jobs. Now we are in a ditch \u2013 with no future, no job. We want a solution quickly,\u201d said a former baker who left his home in Afghanistan after receiving death threats.</p> <p>Steve Bedlam, one of the founders of Refugee Community Kitchen, which has been providing food in the area for the past year, said volunteers were aware of a few informal camps popping up, but refugees were so anxious to avoid police attention that they usually refused offers of help. \u201cVolunteers are wonderful, but they bring attention and authorities. Mostly they say they don\u2019t want any help, because they don\u2019t want the attention, but some people are taking small food parcels to them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Volunteers at Grande-Synthe said they had seen a \u201csteady trickle\u201d of arrivals from Calais, Paris and elsewhere. Until recently, the population was mostly Kurdish, with many families, and more than 120 children, living in about 300 wooden shelters on a patch of land sandwiched between a motorway and a railway line. Recently there have been arrivals from Pakistan and Vietnam. Conditions are better than they were in Calais, but there is no electricity and the health of residents, particularly children, is deteriorating as winter arrives.</p> <p>With conflicts continuing in the Middle East and Africa, the flow of people escaping violence is unlikely to let up, said Florence Vanderborght, a field supervisor at Doctors of the World. \u201cLast year, the population of asylum seekers in Dunkirk rose from 300 to 3,000 between August and October. We didn\u2019t see it coming. It can be very quick,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>The words \u201cbudget\u201d and \u201csafari\u201d are not often found in the same sentence. Safaris are a notoriously expensive holiday choice. But there are ways to enjoy a bush experience for under (sometimes well under) \u00a3150 per person per night, if you do as the locals do. Despite the fall in sterling\u2019s value, the rand/pound exchange rate means that South African safaris, paid for in the local currency, continue to offer the continent\u2019s best value. While many African lodges in Botswana, Kenya and Tanzania, for example, quote only in US dollars, many excellent options in South Africa do not. <br><em>All prices correct at time of writing but approximate because of fluctuations in currency exchange rates</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/travel_south_africa/giv-1406cyRt4XoSQmKp/\" data-alt=\"Safari South Africa map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/travel_south_africa/giv-1406cyRt4XoSQmKp/\">Safari South Africa map</a> </figure>  <h2>Explore the national parks<br></h2> <p>SANParks (South African National Parks, <a href=\"https://www.sanparks.org/\">sanparks.org</a>) is responsible for 20 parks across the country, and its properties are much cheaper than privately operated lodges, including those that have their own concessions in the national parks.</p> <p>The most traditional South African family holiday is a self-drive trip from Johannesburg to the 19,500 sq km (approximately the size of Wales) Kruger national park. Entrance for foreign adult visitors, called the standard conservation fee, is \u00a318 a day (child \u00a39). Bookings should be made online in advance (fee \u00a31.20).</p> <p>Accommodation options in the national parks range from campsites, huts and chalets to cottages and guesthouses, all bookable through the parks\u2019 central website. In Kruger, sociable types can self-cater in one of the rest camps. The largest of these, <a href=\"https://www.sanparks.org/parks/kruger/camps/skukuza/\">Skukuza</a>, offers cottages of various sizes, shops, a decent steakhouse chain restaurant, as well as play areas and swimming pools for families. A cottage for four costs from \u00a3138 a night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b4ce14c832608e85434f85b93d832ad93403f589\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4ce14c832608e85434f85b93d832ad93403f589/0_353_5250_3150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cheetahs crowd around an interesting scent marking on a rock, South Africa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Biyamiti bush camp, in the Kruger national park, is a good place to see cheetahs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those who dream of a truly isolated bush experience might prefer an electricity-free tent at one of the wilderness camps, where only a low fence separates people from animals. At <a href=\"https://www.sanparks.org/parks/kruger/camps/tamboti/\">Tamboti</a>, on the Kruger\u2019s western edge, a two-person tent costs from \u00a332 a night.</p> <p>If getting that intimate with wildlife is too daunting, but regular camps are too big and crowded, a good compromise might be one of Kruger\u2019s many bush camps: three of the most popular are <a href=\"https://www.sanparks.org/parks/kruger/camps/biyamiti/\">Biyamiti</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sanparks.org/parks/kruger/camps/shimuwini/\">Shimuwini</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sanparks.org/parks/kruger/camps/talamati/\">Talamati</a>. A bush cottage at Biyamiti, on the banks of the Mbiyamiti river, which comfortably sleeps a family of four, costs from \u00a3150 a night. Wild dog, white-tailed mongoose, cheetah and leopard are often seen around this camp.</p> <p>Shimuwini is Shangaan for \u201chome of the baobab\u201d and refers to the huge 3,000-year-old trees that line the Letaba river. Cottages along the Shimuwini dam cost from \u00a366 a night for two. At Talamati, residents enjoy the bonus of privacy, as only they are allowed to use its access roads, waterhole and hide. Cottages sleeping two cost from \u00a366 a night. Giraffe, kudu, eland, impala, zebra, rhino and buffalo are all often to be seen from the cottages\u2019 verandas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"44c9e788dd56fbc48d3fa58ce3a54d0b4f12ead3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44c9e788dd56fbc48d3fa58ce3a54d0b4f12ead3/0_192_5700_3420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White Rhino and safari-goers in South Africa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White rhino are relatively plentiful in South Africa\u2019s game reserves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Kruger, like all the SANParks, is set up to make self-driving and self-catering holidays easy, even for novices. Managers and support staff are available around the clock at rest and bush camps, to ensure guests\u2019 comfort and safety. Rangers are available to guide walks or drives, with rates from \u00a312 per adult for a night drive from Skukuza. While groceries are available in the rest camps, the towns of Komatipoort and Malelane, with their supermarkets and off licences, are close by. Water at the bush camps comes from boreholes and is drinkable, but salty.</p> <p>Visitors should note that the Kruger is in a malaria-risk area and that booking is recommended at least 11 months in advance, as the camps are very popular. Cancellations do occur, though, so it\u2019s worth monitoring the site.</p> <h2>Fly to major airports<br></h2> <p>Internal flights in South Africa, especially to airports close to remote bush destinations, such as Skukuza, Hoedspruit, Hazyview, Hluhluwe and Richard\u2019s Bay, are expensive. Picking a safari close to a big city airport served by local low-cost airlines (Mango, Kulula, Safair) will bring the cost down significantly. Car hire all over South Africa is reasonably priced.</p> <p>The malaria-free <a href=\"http://www.pilanesbergnationalpark.org/\">Pilanesberg national park</a>, for example, is just two hours\u2019 drive from central Johannesburg and 1\u00bd from the city\u2019s Lanseria airport. It is one of the most beautiful parks in the country, though its proximity to the huge Sun City holiday resort means it can be extremely busy at weekends and during school holidays. Visit during the week, when prices dip and the 550 sq km park is much less crowded. The <a href=\"http://www.pilanesbergnationalpark.org/accommodation/black-rhino-game-lodge/\">Black Rhino Game Lodge</a> has 18 detached suites overlooking a busy waterhole, from about \u00a3123pppn (low season), including two game drives and three excellent meals a day.</p> <h2>Walk in the morning<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"74f196e7251dced3db6c95f43c982675b19bc3fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74f196e7251dced3db6c95f43c982675b19bc3fd/0_78_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lions lope towards a visitor-laden jeep in Klaserie private nature reserve.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lions lope towards a visitor-laden jeep in Klaserie private nature reserve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Em Gatland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.africaonfoot.com/\">Africa on Foot</a>, in the <a href=\"http://klaseriereserve.co.za/\">Klaserie private nature reserve</a>, bordering the Kruger, is six hours\u2019 drive from Johannesburg. The basic but comfortable camp offers guided big-five walking safaris every morning, and guided game drives in the evening. The Klaserie shares unfenced borders with the Kruger and guests can expect to encounter the big five, as well as wild dog, cheetah, honey badger, porcupine, aardvark, plus small cats \u2013 civet, caracal and serval. Guests can also request a night sleeping under the stars in the lodge\u2019s treehouse. Rates for 2017 are from \u00a3150pppn including three meals a day, a walk and a bush drive each day.</p> <h2>Travel out of high season <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3f6b157dc45dce0d79776dd0b3a484e3f3df6be3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f6b157dc45dce0d79776dd0b3a484e3f3df6be3/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A leopard tortoise at Samara private game reserve.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A leopard tortoise at Samara private game reserve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rates for most lodges are also significantly cheaper off peak. South Africa\u2019s dry winter (between May and September) is considered low season, even though, in the north of the country, it is the best time for game viewing. During the drier months, animals congregate around waterholes, making game viewing much easier than in the hot, rainy summers, when they are dispersed and harder to spot in the long grass.</p> <p>In the north of the country, close to the Botswana border and a 3\u00bd-hour drive from Lanseria airport, the family-owned and run <a href=\"http://www.thebushcamp.com/\">Mosetla Bush Camp and Eco Lodge</a>, in the malaria-free, game-rich Madikwe reserve, offers great value for money and reliable game viewing year-round. This rustic camp has no electricity and is lit at night by romantic paraffin lamps; water is provided by wood-fired \u201cdonkey boilers\u201d. The fence around the camp keeps the elephants out, but sightings of hyena, civet and buffalo around the huts are common. Rates are at about \u00a3150pppn. This includes two ranger-guided safaris and three meals a day.</p> <p>The 283 sq km <a href=\"http://www.samara.co.za/\">Samara game reserve</a> is a 2\u00bd-hour drive from Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape. Off peak, it\u2019s possible to stay in the reserve\u2019s Sibella suite in its upmarket and luxurious Karoo Lodge for \u00a3139pppn. Samara, in the dramatically beautiful Camdeboo national park, is famous for its vistas. An ideal addition to a trip up the <a href=\"http://www.gardenroute.co.za/\">Garden Route</a>, it\u2019s malaria-free and home to cheetah, black and white rhino, giraffe, buffalo, enormous herds of eland, wildebeest, zebra and, most uniquely, the timid and seldom-sighted aardvark. Samara does not offer large predators, as it is focused on cheetah conservation.</p> <h2>Stay just outside the national parks</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c6a7cb9dd48314af601b4c4770dc12007103bb7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6a7cb9dd48314af601b4c4770dc12007103bb7e/0_243_5364_3220/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honeyguide Ranger Camp, South Africa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It is easy and often more affordable to stay outside the parks and self-drive or book guided game drives once inside, via SANParks or the individual park. <a href=\"https://www.sanparks.org/parks/addo/\">Addo Elephant national park</a>, an hour\u2019s drive from Port Elizabeth and its airport, is a typical example.

  "<p>The capture of eastern Aleppo by Syrian rebels in July 2012 was a severe blow to the regime of Bashar al-Assad early in the country\u2019s civil war. Ever since, the brutal, attritional warfare wrought on Syria\u2019s second city has served as a microcosm of the wider conflict.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s pro-regime intervention in late September 2015 turned the military tide, allowing Assad to prioritise the isolation and eventual recapture of opposition-held districts. These already devastated areas now stand on the brink of a renewed offensive as Moscow tries to force a decisive victory for Assad while the US is preoccupied with its presidential election. </p> <p>This objective is ambitious \u2013 rebel fighters know the territory intimately and have had years to prepare for a street-by-street assault. But Moscow and Damascus know that a rebel defeat would be a psychological blow from which their cause might not recover. Aleppo is their last urban stronghold, and relegating the rebellion to a rural insurgency is a major aim of the regime.</p> <p>Using highly granular data tracking nearly 1,500 locations in Aleppo, it is possible to show how the stranglehold on the east of the city has tightened since Russia\u2019s intervention; and how even ceasefires appear to have been used strategically, with hostilities pausing only when the regime reached important waypoints.</p> <h2>Early October saw the familiar pattern of airstrikes, regime gains and then a pause</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/aleppo-zip/giv-14067LSlVsXtZxiE/\" data-alt=\"October map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/aleppo-zip/giv-14067LSlVsXtZxiE/\">October map</a> </figure>  <p>Since the collapse of the September ceasefire, regime forces backed by Russian airstrikes have continued their assault on Aleppo\u2019s eastern districts. The main theatres have been to the north of the rebel-held redoubt, where the regime continues to consolidate its control of roads which might be used to resupply the rebels, and in the south, where the regime has retaken an outlying district and resisted attempts by the rebels to link up with their allies in the western suburbs.<br></p> <p>A three-day ceasefire in mid-October was not long enough to evacuate civilians, but the intervening period has been relatively calm. The rebels sought to use this period to break the siege by shelling government-held areas of western Aleppo. Regime forces have fought back and limited the rebel gains, and all the while the Russians have signalled that they are preparing for a major offensive. A large Russian taskforce led by the country\u2019s sole sole aircraft carrier, Admiral Kuznetsov, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/russia-cancels-spanish-fuel-stop-for-syria-bound-warships\">has been sailing towards Syria</a>, and a Russian deadline for people to abandon eastern Aleppo expired on Friday night.</p> <h2>September\u2019s brief truce came only after pro-regime forces encircled the rebels</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/aleppo-zip/giv-1406dLzSZO8bkIyh/\" data-alt=\"September map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/aleppo-zip/giv-1406dLzSZO8bkIyh/\">September map</a> </figure>  <p>The nationwide ceasefire that began on 12 September was supposed to help deliver aid to besieged rebel-held areas and pave the way for an ambitious US-Russian air campaign against Islamic State and other extremist groups.

Meanwhile, on the Tibetan border \u2013 the global frontline of climate change \u2013 environmental issues are also being taught to youngsters. Worrying yet hopeful, and beautifully shot.<em> Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Strictly Come Dancing<br> 6.55pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Expect spray tans, dad jokes and Ed Balls gliding gracefully across the floor for week seven. There\u2019s been plenty of drama so far in the series, said to be Len Goodman\u2019s last. Who will the Strictly curse strike next? Lines open at the end of tonight\u2019s episode so the public can decide which of the nine to boot off. Winkleman and Daly guide proceedings nicely, but it still seems cruel to make the dancers run up all those stairs after strutting their stuff. <em>Grace Rahman</em></p> <h2>The X Factor<br> 8pm, ITV</h2> <p>Following Gifty\u2019s shock exit last week, no one is safe. Even so, this week\u2019s theme \u2013 boyband v girlband \u2013 surely gives largely lifeless wildcards Four Of Diamonds and poundland JLS Five After Midnight some kind of advantage over the rest. As well as the two groups, Emily, Sam, Matt, Ryan, Saara and \u2013 of course \u2013 Honey G are still in the running. Whether the latter is a genius performance artist, an unfunny spoof or just chronically deluded remains to be seen. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2><strong>Britain\u2019s Ancient Tracks With Tony Robinson<br> </strong><strong>8pm, Channel 4</strong></h2> <p>The final trek in this series, along Britain\u2019s oldest trackways, takes Tony Robinson up the North Downs Way, a route utilised by traders, hunters and invaders for millennia. Thought to have offered \u2013 and Brexiteers will doubtless be delighted to hear this \u2013 open access to mainland Europe in prehistoric times, the route would later afford ingress to Celts and Romans alike, providing a rich seam of archaic artefacts for modern history hunters. <em>Mark Gibbings-Jones</em></p> <h2>The Code<br> 9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Penultimate-episode time for this smart, gripping cyber-thriller, and following an attack on the protest march, a life lies in the balance. Will the outcome drive Roth (an excellent Anthony LaPaglia) further into a supervillain-style rage? You betcha: \u201cI haven\u2019t decided what systems I\u2019m going to target yet, but what I do know is nobody pays attention unless a lot of people are screaming,\u201d he snarls wickedly.

Set amid Atlanta\u2019s grassroots hip-hop scene, it\u2019s a textured, sometimes surreal tale of hustle and flow, with Glover\u2019s would-be mogul Earn teaming up with his gruff rapping cousin to navigate the pitfalls of the music biz, from radio payola to street beef. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Murder Files With Martin Kemp<br>9pm, Quest</h2> <p>The ex-EastEnder, now luminously orange and silver like a galvanised Troll Doll, is merely the bookend for a workmanlike look at Fred and Rose West\u2019s crimes.

Matthew Broderick is novice union colonel Robert Shaw who leads the fighting 54th; Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington are among those called up. The recreations of Gettysburg and Fort Wagner are stunning, and led to an Oscar for cinematographer Freddie Francis. <em>PH</em></p> <p><strong>The Impossible (JA Bayona, 2012), 10pm, Channel 4<br></strong>The Boxing Day tsunami of 2004 killed 230,000 people in south-east Asia, and this gripping film brings all the shock, horror and emotion of the disaster surging back. It\u2019s based on the true story of a Spanish family who were separated in the chaos and struggled desperately to locate each other. Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts are excellent as the parents in an extraordinary tale of familial love and survival. <em>PH</em></p> <p>The Lady Vanishes (Alfred Hitchcock, 1938) Saturday, 1pm, BBC2<br>Dame May Whitty is portly Miss Froy, who disappears from a train between the Tyrol and London; a concerned Iris (Margaret Lockwood) enlists handsome young Gilbert (Michael Redgrave) to help find her. A brilliant comic thriller set almost entirely on the train, The Lady Vanishes also introduces the famed double act of Charters and Caldicott, a pair of imperturbable, archetypal English gents played by Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne.

  "<p>For the past two months, California has been brimming with pumpkins. From country lanes to freeways, the agricultural fields that surround us are dotted with orange. The occasional scarecrow flaps crookedly on its pole, overseeing its seasonal crop.</p> <p>Since coming here with my family, we have visited as many farms as possible \u2013 a good distraction for my small baby, not to mention being super\u2011interesting for her parents.

Butternut squash is available almost everywhere in the UK. It is a delicious, dense variety that works well in baking \u2013 ideal for cakes, pumpkin pies and this week\u2019s bundt cake, combined with added spices, maple syrup and a cream-cheese frosting \u2013 a quintessential, and American-inspired, autumn cake. I use spelt flour for this as I love its nutty flavour. It\u2019s also an ancient grain, less refined than other flours, giving it better shelf life and disease resistance.</p> <p>I had read before about making caramel from sweet potatoes, harnessing the intense natural sweetness of the root, and thought I would try it with squash. The technique of cooking squash in water, then caramelising its natural sugars while stirring produces a thick, sweet and concentrated paste which is delicious folded through ice-creams, dolloped on almost any cake as a topping, or served with roasted meats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/28/halloween-meringue-bones-recipe-bonfire-toffee-claire-ptak-baking\">Claire Ptak\u2019s halloween recipes for meringue bones and bonfire toffee | Baking</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Pumpkin maple bundt cake (main picture)<br></strong></h2> <p><strong>Serves 8-10</strong><br>1 large butternut squash or sweet pumpkin (about 500g), halved, seeds scraped, baked cut-side down, cooled<br>200g vegetable or mild olive oil<br>100g caster sugar<br>100g maple syrup<br>100g light brown sugar<br>4 eggs<br>100g ginger, peeled and finely grated<br>280g fine/white spelt flour <br>\u00bd tsp salt<br>2 tsp bicarbonate of soda<br>2 tsp cinnamon<br>A grating of nutmeg</p> <p><strong> For the icing</strong><br>250g cream cheese<br>1 tsp vanilla<br>200g icing sugar<br>1 tbsp maple syrup</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4.

In front of a sell-out crowd, a young American team lost by eight tries to one and learned a lot about top-level rugby.</p> <p>The Eagles in fact started strongly, in the hard-hitting vein of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/10/us-eagles-maori-all-blacks-cam-dolan\">a 29-19 loss in Philadelphia three years ago</a>. But they wasted the first clear chance of the night, captain Todd Clever stepping inside instead of using Danny Barrett on the overlap after the wing Matai Leuta had been sent clear. The Maori immediately made clear the cost of such errors, full-back Damian McKenzie scattering the defence before the wing James Lowe strolled over on the left. Ihaia West converted.<br></p> <p>Barrett showed strongly with a charge or two in between plenty of rather aimless kicking from both sides, but his opposing No8, Akira Ioane, got the Maori\u2019s second try. The tourists ran a move round the front of a lineout, having drawn Eagles wing Martin Iosefo away from his station. They therefore found the defence staffed only by the scrum-half Nate Augspurger, and he fell off Ioane like a scrap of ice from a slow-moving berg. West converted again.</p> <p>The Maori nearly had a third try, Kane Hames penalised for a double movement, but Hames and fellow prop Ben May put an end to the next Eagles advance with one big shove. Up popped the American props, out of a scrum in a good attacking position.</p> <p>After that, a one-two ended the game as a contest. The third Maori try came from a planned move, a chip from West finding the centre Matt Proctor and his pass sending Lowe strolling over again. If there was a whiff of offside about the charging Maori three-quarters, the delicacy of West\u2019s chip and Proctor\u2019s equally fine flip dispelled it. West made it 21-0 and by the break the margin was 28, the Maori pack driving a maul for hooker and captain Ash Dixon to score in the absence of his opposite number, James Hilterbrand, who was shown a yellow card for killing the ball.</p> <p>It took four minutes of the second half for the fifth try to come, Ioane ambling over again, the Eagles\u2019 defence absent presumed flummoxed by backline feints behind another lineout maul. A similar play then gave the Eagles their consolation try \u2013 with all of half an hour still to go \u2013 Clever stretching over after a concerted shove. Will Holder kicked the conversion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fbc099a7e866ba14828a05a22b6e2145e3fd7f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fbc099a7e866ba14828a05a22b6e2145e3fd7f1/0_47_4643_2788/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Lowe of the Maori All Blacks runs in for his second try.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Lowe of the Maori All Blacks runs in for his second try.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Walter/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hames ran in Maori try No6, the once-capped All Black loosehead galloping over from a McKenzie counter launched from yet another missed touch kick.

On the final whistle, McKenzie kicked the final two points.</p> <p>Eagles coach John Mitchell was missing key players employed by European clubs, but would have hoped to show more strongly before games against Romania and Tonga for which such professionals will be present.

Back in 1992, Hillary Clinton was something of an oddity, a political spouse with her own high-powered career, who hadn\u2019t set it aside to stand by her husband when Bill Clinton became governor of Arkansas.

Bill Clinton had funneled state business into her law firm.</p> <p>When asked about her career in a press gaggle, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EGranwN_uk\">Clinton responded</a>, \u201cYou know, I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life. And I tried very, very hard to be as careful as possible, and that\u2019s all that I can tell you.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T02:20:01.488Z\">at 2.20am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581d3f28e4b07ceadb3a2a40\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T02:08:48.725Z\">2.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some video of Beyonce\u2019s arrival in Cleveland:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/awzurcher/status/794723013891649536\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The much awaited Beyonc\u00e9 entrance at the Clinton rally <a href=\"https://t.co/UtwwZ6gfau\">pic.twitter.com/UtwwZ6gfau</a></p>&mdash; Anthony Zurcher (@awzurcher) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/awzurcher/status/794723013891649536\">November 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SabrinaSiddiqui/status/794722799642378240\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Beyonce&#39;s backup dancers are wearing &quot;I&#39;m with her&quot; t-shirts.</p>&mdash; Sabrina Siddiqui (@SabrinaSiddiqui) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SabrinaSiddiqui/status/794722799642378240\">November 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T02:09:21.992Z\">at 2.09am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581d3d9be4b07ceadb3a2a3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T02:03:12.665Z\">2.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cThere was a time a woman\u2019s opinion did not matter,\u201d Beyonce says. \u201cLess than 100 years ago women did not have the right to vote.
