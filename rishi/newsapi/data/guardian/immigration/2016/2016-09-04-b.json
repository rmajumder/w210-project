  "<p>There are many sides to the refugee debate in Australia, but an overarching question is this: how can we create a more sustainable and humane policy that accords with international law?</p> <p>I was challenged to identify a single intervention that could have this effect. It seemed a formidable task, but the answer is quite simple if we go back to first principles.</p> <p>We could insert a legislative requirement that Australian law must be interpreted in good faith, in accordance with our responsibilities under international refugee law and international human rights law.</p> <p>In most democratic countries, no one would blink at such a proposal. It simply reflects basic rules of international law. It\u2019s sobering that in Australia, a provision like this would be seen as radical.</p> <p>Australia is the only country whose law explicitly says it is \u201cirrelevant\u201d whether or not our <em>non-refoulement </em>obligations are engaged when removing an asylum seeker. Indeed, under the Migration Act, an official\u2019s duty to remove such a person \u201carises irrespective of whether there has been an assessment, according to law, of Australia\u2019s <em>non-refoulement</em> obligations in respect of the non-citizen.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">The Nauru files: cache of 2,000 leaked reports reveal scale of abuse of children in Australian offshore detention</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The principle of <em>non-refoulement</em> is the cornerstone of the international refugee regime. If there is one thing on which all states agree \u2013 even those that are not parties to the Refugee Convention \u2013 it is that this principle is sacrosanct. It prohibits the return of people to places where they risk being persecuted, tortured, subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or arbitrarily deprived of life. </p> <p>This September, the principle will be reaffirmed unreservedly in the political declaration that world leaders will adopt at the UN secretary general\u2019s summit on refugees in New York.</p> <p>To my knowledge, Australia is also the only country to have deleted all references to the refugee convention from its domestic law. Instead, it has replaced them with a \u201cself-contained statutory framework\u201d setting out Australia\u2019s own interpretation of its protection obligations under the refugee convention. International law makes clear that states do not have the right to auto-interpret their treaty obligations. </p> <p>Basic rules of treaty interpretation state that a treaty must be interpreted in good faith, and in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context, and in the light of the treaty\u2019s object and purpose. Furthermore, asserting that a treaty obligation is inconsistent with domestic law provides no justification for breaching it.</p> <p>If Australia did insert a legislative provision requiring a principled, good faith interpretation in accordance with international refugee law and international human rights law, our approach to asylum would necessarily change.</p> <p>For a start, it would flip our focus towards the responsibility to provide protection, as part of a global cooperative effort, rather than deflecting those in need. It would mean that people seeking asylum would live among us in the Australian community, not in closed mandatory detention. </p> <p>Offshore processing could not continue, and families would not be separated. Children\u2019s best interests would be a primary consideration in every decision affecting them. Refugees would be welcomed into Australian society quickly, resulting in greater cultural, economic and social benefits over time. People would not be pushed back at sea without the opportunity to have their protection claim thoroughly examined and reviewed. </p> <p>Principled, effective and transparent refugee status determination in Australia would be reinstated, with well-trained decision-makers, access to legal assistance, and robust independent merits and judicial review.</p> <p>All this might sound like wishful thinking in today\u2019s political climate. But each element reflects a feasible past practice in Australian asylum policy.</p> <p>By learning from history and effective practices, we could model \u201cprotection in action\u201d. In turn, we could help to grow the capacity for protection and assistance within our region. We would regain our international reputation as a welcoming country that respects human rights and the rule of law \u2026 and we would also save a lot of money.</p> <p>The drafters of the refugee convention \u2013 including Australia\u2019s representative \u2013 were well aware that refugee protection was not a way to short-circuit migration controls. In fact, the refugee regime requires the most stringent checks of all. But what they also recognised was that never again should the world bear witness to millions of people fleeing for safety and being turned away.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/the-claim-that-locking-asylum-seekers-up-in-nauru-and-png-saves-lives-is-bogus\">The claim that locking asylum seekers up in Nauru and PNG saves lives is bogus | Philippe Legrain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Refugees and other vulnerable migrants embark on dangerous land and sea journeys because there are no safe alternatives. Governments could rectify this situation, and save lives, with some simple policy changes \u2013 for instance, by creating humanitarian visas allowing travel to places of safety, by increasing resettlement, or by abolishing carrier sanctions that impose hefty fees on airlines that transport people without visas.</p> <p>Acknowledging that forced migration will continue for as long as war, persecution and human rights violations continue, it is imperative that we adopt a policy that does the least damage to people who have been forced to leave their homes. </p> <p>Our current approaches are not sustainable, fiscally responsible or protection-sensitive. We must develop and promote durable, legal and humane solutions for people in need of protection.

Disappointed by the harsh tone of Trump\u2019s Phoenix speech, the Republican National Committee <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/us/politics/donald-trump-rnc-reince-priebus.html?_r=0\">reportedly</a> withheld planned praise.</p> <p>\u201cHe pivots and then pivots right back,\u201d the Arizona senator Jeff Flake told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday. \u201cSo it\u2019s kind of a 360-degree pivot at times. That\u2019s not clear at all. Some people said it was hardening, some said softening. I say it was just confusing.\u201d</p> <p>Flake is one of a handful of Republican senators who have refused to support Trump, though he said on Sunday he would like to escape that \u201cuncomfortable\u201d position and vote for the businessman. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see a firm position that he sticks with for a while,\u201d he said, \u201cand obviously I\u2019d like to see a more realistic position in dealing with those who are here illegally now.\u201d</p> <p>But Flake also damned Trump with a hint of praise for his rival, Hillary Clinton, who has recently urged Republicans to remember that the businessman\u2019s claims that Mexicans are \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/02/donald-trump-racist-claims-mexico-rapes\">rapists</a>\u201d and refugees a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-warns-refugees-could-be-trojan-horse-for-u-s/\">Trojan horse</a>\u201d of terrorism do not reflect their party. </p> <p>\u201cFor people to be reminded that this is not what the party stands for I think is a good thing,\u201d Flake said. \u201cI wish more Republicans would say that as well. But if Hillary Clinton wants to say it I\u2019m glad \u2013 I\u2019m glad people, voters, are being reminded of it, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday night Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/772556213313765377\">responded on Twitter</a> \u2013 by bashing Flake. \u201cThe Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as Jeff Flake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration,\u201d he said. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/772571293438840832\">Shortly thereafter</a>, he elaborated: Flake, he said, was \u201ca very weak and ineffective senator\u201d.</p> <p>Trump and Flake had already clashed, exchanging sharp words in July when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/07/donald-trump-meeting-congress-republicans-divided-responses\">the Arizona senator confronted Trump</a> in a meeting with elected Republicans on Capitol Hill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b83f948a778a654583782a3dab8f706cd11dacee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b83f948a778a654583782a3dab8f706cd11dacee/0_155_4720_2833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump Phoenix\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump supporters during his immigration policy speech in Phoenix this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cruz/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/az/arizona_trump_vs_clinton-5832.html\">the realclearpolitics.com poll average</a> for Arizona, which has been won by a Democratic presidential candidate once in 65 years, Trump leads Clinton by less than three points. However, a rapidly growing Hispanic population means the state\u2019s politics are turning steadily from red to purple, if not yet blue, prompting Clinton to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/01/politics/hillary-clinton-arizona-advertising-immigration/\">advertise</a>. In attacking Flake, Trump is unlikely to aid his own Arizonan cause.</p> <p>Senator John McCain, Flake\u2019s fellow Arizona senator and the party\u2019s 2008 presidential nominee, has started running an ad that look toward a hypothetical Clinton presidency.<br></p> <p>\u201cMy opponent, Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, is a good person,\u201d he says <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAdOwaIQ-E \">in the ad</a>. \u201cBut if Hillary Clinton is elected president, Arizona will need a senator who will act as a check, not a rubber stamp, on the White House.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is conspicuously absent from the ad: his name unsaid, his image omitted and his ideas implicitly rejected as McCain tells voters: \u201cWe need more control over our borders but also smarter immigration policies that enforce the law and reflect our values.\u201d</p> <p>McCain has not explicitly rejected Trump, who last year mocked the Vietnam war veteran <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/19/donald-trump-john-mccain-vietnam-prisoner-of-war\">for having been captured</a> by the Vietcong, but he has repeatedly asked the businessman to apologize to other former prisoners of war. Months of such harsh rhetoric from Trump have painted Republicans like McCain in a corner, Flake admitted, by threatening to turn reliably red states like Arizona into swing states. </p> <p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be up for grabs,\u201d he said, \u201cbut frankly it is.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018When America is safe, we will be open to all of the options\u2019</h2> <p>Even Trump\u2019s most stalwart allies could not seem to agree about his immigration message, even though the businessman said in Phoenix: \u201cYou can call it whatever the hell you want. They (undocumented immigrants) are gone.\u201d</p> <p>Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union that Trump had left \u201ca very big opening for what will happen with the people that remain here in the United States after the criminals are removed and after the border is secure\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen America is safe, we will be open to all of the options,\u201d Giuliani said. According to the former mayor, Trump \u201cwould find it very, very difficult to throw out a family that\u2019s been here for 15 years, and they have three children, two of whom are citizens. And that is not the kind of America he wants.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told ABC\u2019s This Week through crosstalk with the host that it was \u201ccorrect\u201d the businessman would deport more than just migrants with a criminal record \u2013 and then changed her tone. </p> <p>\u201cBut,\u201d she said, \u201cno, but he also said that, once you enforce the law, once you get rid of the criminals, then we\u2019ll see where we are.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we don\u2019t know where we\u2019ll be. We don\u2019t know who will be left. We don\u2019t know where they live, who they are. That\u2019s the whole point here, that we\u2019ve actually never tried this.\u201d</p> <p>The man who would serve Trump as vice-president, Indiana governor Mike Pence, evaded any clear answer about his running mate\u2019s position. In an interview aired Sunday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/mike-pence-will-release-tax-returns-next-week\">with NBC\u2019s Meet the Press</a>, he said: \u201cWhat Donald Trump laid out this week in Arizona was really a roadmap to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Pence then rattled off some of Trump\u2019s ideas, including a wall on the southern border, targeting people who have overstayed visas and increasing border patrol staff, but left details for the future. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll give consideration, working with the Congress, in a new and reformed immigration system, to consider it at that time,\u201d he said.</p> <p>All three said Trump would prioritize deportations of people with criminal records, the same strategy Barack Obama has taken during his two terms, during which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/21/latino-immigrants-us-war-on-terror-study\">record numbers of migrants have been deported</a> and Border Patrol staffing has reached an all-time high. Obama has also deferred deportations for several million migrants who came to the US as children through executive actions that Trump has said he will rescind.</p> <p>Giuliani also conceded the limits of Trump\u2019s shifting deportation plans, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/27/donald-trump-deport-11-million-migrants-is-that-even-possible\">would eject between 4 and 11 million people</a> and cost <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/01/trumps-big-immigration-crackdown-comes-with-a-big-5-year-price-tag-more-than-50-billion/\">an estimated $50bn</a>. But he and Conway insisted that Trump will somehow force Mexico to pay for the proposed border wall, even though Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">told Trump this week</a> it would not.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"831ff957c45156a52f27689a8fad0b3e5130fbcf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/831ff957c45156a52f27689a8fad0b3e5130fbcf/0_18_4365_2619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump and Pena Nieto\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Donald Trump shake hands after a meeting in Mexico City on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuri Cortez/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/who-will-win-presidential-election-2016-labor-day-prediction\">Who will win the presidential election?

Labor Secretary Tom Perez told CNN that Trump was \u201ca loose cannon\u201d and said his week of Janus-faced speeches \u201cwas a perfect illustration of why he\u2019s not fit to be president\u201d. </p> <p>In a taped interview with CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria, Obama was more stoic, saying anti-immigrant sentiment could be traced to the founding of the US, \u201cbut that\u2019s not the majority of America\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe next generation of Americans, they utter \u2013 completely reject the kinds of positions that he\u2019s taking,\u201d the president said. \u201cSo overall, I\u2019m optimistic. But, you know, I think we have to pay close attention to what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>Polls suggest that only some voters were swayed by Trump\u2019s winding week.

  "<p>Hopes that the US and Russia could reach agreement on a joint initiative to tackle Islamic State and stem the violence in Syria\u2019s brutal civil war have suffered a setback after the US said Russia had retreated on some issues it believed had been settled.</p> <p>The US Department of State had said it was hopeful that the US president, Barack Obama, and Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, would reach an understanding at the G20 summit taking place in China. But on a day that saw Syrian government troops resume their siege of the city of Aleppo, a planned joint press conference between the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was cancelled. The agreement would have been the culmination of long-running talks between the US and Russia in Moscow, Washington and Geneva. </p> <p>The deal focuses on a slowdown in the Syrian air campaign against rebel forces in return for an agreement that Russian and Syrian air forces can target Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, the former al-Nusra Front forces linked with al-Qaida. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/al-qaida-syria-nusra-split-terror-network\">Al-Nusra changed its name to Jabhat Fateh al-Sham</a> (Conquest of Syria) in July in what was seen as a rebranding exercise by some but a genuine ideological shift by others.</p> <p>Many US-backed Syrian rebel groups have worked alongside al-Nusra and are reluctant to abandon that cooperation, arguing it is an effective fighting force willing to risk lives to defeat the common enemy, President Bashar al-Assad. </p> <p>In practice, it would be hard to disentangle US-recognised forces from al-Sham and would mean a level of unprecedented intelligence sharing between the US and Russia. Negotiators on both sides have spent weeks looking at maps of areas where opposition groups operate and where Assad\u2019s forces would be prohibited from launching airstrikes. A deal might also open the way for the restoration of UN humanitarian convoys across Syria, and a ceasefire in Aleppo, where 250,000 civilians are still under the threat of starvation in the east of the city.</p> <p>Speaking on the sidelines of the <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/barack-obama-xi-jinping-discuss-south-china-sea-thaad-deployment-during-night-stroll-eve-g20-1579548\">G20 summit that got under way in Hangzhou</a>, China, on Sunday morning, Obama said both countries still had \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/syrian-regime-warplanes-allegedly-bomb-rebels-response-major-offensive-hama-1579267\">grave differences</a>\u201d over the future course of action to put an end to the five years of violence in Syria. \u201cI think it\u2019s premature for us to say there\u2019s a clear path forward, but there\u2019s the possibility at least for us to make some progress,\u201d the US president said.</p> <p>The UN special envoy on Syria had said he hoped a deal could be struck between in Geneva on Saturday before the G20, at separate meetings in London next week with the main Syrian opposition negotiating committee, and then the UN general assembly in New York later in September. But the talks have not made the expected progress, due partly to the lack of trust between Russia and the US. </p> <p>The Turkish incursion into northern Syria, part of a bid to force back Kurdish forces supported by the US, has complicated the already multi-layered civil war. </p> <p>Speaking to the G20, Obama said: \u201cIt is a very complicated piece of business. These are difficult negotiations. We have grave differences with the Russians in terms of both the parties we support but also the process that\u2019s required to bring about peace in Syria.</p> <p> \u201cBut if we do not get some buy-in from the Russians on reducing the violence and easing the humanitarian crisis it\u2019s difficult to see how we get to the next phase.\u201d</p> <p>The US has been sceptical of forging military ties with Russia, blaming the country for <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/russias-claims-it-killed-key-isis-leader-abu-muhammad-al-adnani-laughable-says-us-1579176\">violating ceasefire treaties</a> during the Syrian civil war. Russian forces in Syria have also been blamed for attacks on civilian targets, including a field hospital and an <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/syria-msf-hospital-bombed-russian-warplanes-targeted-rescuers-second-tap-air-strike-1544663\">airstrike on a M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res hospital</a>.</p> <p> Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said a deal was close but that Washington had to dissociate itself from Sham. \u201cMany of the groups considered acceptable by the US have actually affiliated with the Nusra Front, while the Nusra Front is using them to avoid being attacked,\u201d Ryabkov told Russian media.</p> <p>The situation on the ground near the Turkey-Syria border was developing fast on Sunday, as the Syrian army and allied forces took control of an area south of Aleppo, severing the only remaining route into the eastern neighbourhoods held by the rebels. \u201cThe armed forces, in cooperation with their allies, took full control of the military academy zone south of Aleppo and are clearing the remaining terrorists from the area,\u201d state television said, citing a military source. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said rebels backed by Turkish tanks and warplanes had seized the last parts of the border held by Isis. \u201cIsis has lost its contact with the outside world after losing the remaining border villages,\u201d the UK-based monitor said. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Turkey\u2019s prime minister later confirmed the news. Speaking at a dinner with non-government organisations in the south-eastern city of Diyarbak\u0131r, Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m said: \u201cFrom Azaz to Jarablus, 91km (57 miles) of our border has been completely secured. All the terrorist groups are pushed back \u2013 they are gone.\u201d <br></p> <p>Much of the work to expel Isis from other parts of the border has been carried out by the Syrian Kurdish YPG, working with the US-led coalition. But Ankara considers the YPG a terrorist group and has been alarmed by its expansion along the border, fearing the creation of a contiguous, semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northern Syria. </p>",

In July it published an interim report saying it was not yet convinced that buying sex should be outlawed, but that soliciting by sex workers should be decriminalised.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/04/keith-vaz-one-scandal-too-many-for-the-publicity-seeking-mp\">Keith Vaz: one scandal too many for the publicity-seeking MP</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, said that he regarded this as a \u201cprivate matter\u201d and that he had no intention of suspending Vaz from the party, but that Vaz\u2019s future as the chair of the home affairs committee was a matter for the committee and Vaz himself to decide.</p> <p>\u201cHe has not committed any crime that I know of,\u201d said Corbyn, when asked if he was happy for Vaz to remain in the Labour party. \u201cHe is going to meet the home affairs committee and discuss with them what his role will be in the future. I\u2019m not sure what their decision will be.\u201d</p> <p>Vaz seems to be hoping that that he will be able to temporarily stand aside without having to give up the chairmanship, which he has held for nine years, for good. But his fate will depend on whether fellow members of the committee accept this solution or whether they take the view that the allegations have made his position as chairman permanently untenable.</p> <p>On Saturday night, when the story first broke, Vaz gave a statement to the Mail on Sunday saying that he was \u201cgenuinely sorry for the hurt and distress that has been caused by my actions in particular to my wife and children\u201d and that he would be \u201cstanding aside\u201d from chairing home affairs committee hearings with immediate affect.</p> <p>On Sunday morning his office released a statement to the media which said nothing about being sorry or standing aside, but which criticised the Sunday Mirror and said he was referring the allegations to his lawyers. His office refused to say whether he stood by the comment issued to the Mail on Sunday.</p> <p>Then, on Sunday afternoon, Vaz issued a fresh statement signalling that he intended to duck out of the limelight. \u201cAt this time I do not want there to be any distraction from the important work the home affairs select committee undertakes so well,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSelect committees do vital work in holding the government and others to account. We are due to publish two reports, one into antisemitism and the other into FGM in the next few days, in addition we have a number of key witnesses.</p> <p> \u201cI will of course inform committee members first of my plans when we meet on Tuesday.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday the committee is scheduled to take evidence from the immigration minister Robert Goodwill and on Wednesday it will be questioning Amber Rudd, the new home secretary. Vaz\u2019s office and the committee\u2019s spokesperson were unable to say who would be chairing those sessions.</p> <p>Naz Shah, a Labour MP who sits on the committee, said on Sunday that it was right for Vaz to stand aside from the chairmanship. John Whittingdale, the Conservative former culture secretary, also said this was the correct move for Vaz. \u201cGiven the areas [for] which the committee is responsible, that does seem to me to be a sensible course of action,\u201d Whittingdale told Sky News.</p> <p>Diane Abbott, the shadow health secretary, told the same programme that she did not want to comment on Vaz\u2019s future but that \u201cthis must be a dreadful time for him, and his family \u2013 his wife and his two children.\u201d </p> <p>According to the Sunday Mirror, which has illustrated its report with a picture showing Vaz with a man said to be one of the escorts, the MP met two eastern European male sex workers eight days ago in a flat he owns in north London.<br></p> <p>According to the paper, Vaz asked one of the men in a text message sent before the encounter to bring poppers, the sex-enhancing drug used by gay men that the government came close to banning in a law passed this year.</p> <p>Vaz argued in parliament that poppers should not be included in a list of substances banned by the Psychoactive Substances Act and in the paper he is quoted as telling the escorts that he did not use them himself.</p> <p>Vaz, who reportedly told the men his name was Jim and that he was a washing machine salesman, is also quoted discussing with the men the possibility of obtaining cocaine for the next time they met, although Vaz reportedly said he would not want to take the drug himself.<br></p> <p>The paper says two payments of \u00a3150 each were made into a bank account before the 27 August encounter after one of the escorts supplied the account details to Vaz. </p> <p>The Sunday Mirror also claimed that the money paid into the bank account of one of the escorts on behalf of Vaz was paid in by a man linked to a diabetes charity set up by the MP.</p> <p>The Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said he would be urging the Charity Commission to investigate. Bridgen also said he would be writing to the parliamentary commissioner for standards regarding Vaz\u2019s conduct.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Charity Commission said it was aware of the allegations made regarding an individual linked to the charity Silver Star. \u201cThe commission has asked journalists to forward any details and evidence they have in order to determine whether there is a regulatory role for the commission.\u201d</p> <p>There is no suggestion in the newspaper report that the charity\u2019s money was used in the affair or that the man knew what the payment was for. <br></p> <p>In its interim report on prostitution in July, the home affairs committee said: \u201cWe are not yet convinced that the sex buyer law would be effective in reducing demand or in improving the lives of sex workers, either in terms of the living conditions for those who continue to work in prostitution or the effectiveness of services to help them find new ways to earn a living.</p> <p>\u201cEvaluations of the impact of sex buyer laws are largely based on data about street prostitution, and therefore offer little insight into the large parts of the sex industry which take place in various indoor environments, and there are indications that the law can be misused to harass and victimise sex workers, who are the very people whom the law is seeking to protect.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to Vaz\u2019s comment, a spokeswoman for the Sunday Mirror said the paper \u201cstands by the story\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><strong>5 September 2016.</strong> This article has been edited to re-emphasise that the Silver Star charity did not make any payments in connection with the recent claims concerning Mr Vaz.</li> </ul>",

Some, no doubt, find the romanticism cloying and over-sentimental and the phoney Cornish accents make many Cornish wince.\u201d </p> <p>However, he argued the series drew attention to social problems still being felt today. \u201cWhilst set in the late 18th century, it serves as a metaphor for exploitation of the poor by the rich today; this is as relevant to present-day Cornwall as it was in the past.\u201d </p> <p>Joseph Crawford, a lecturer in English across the border at Exeter University, said Ross Poldark\u2019s struggles to keep his mine open neatly <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-ross-poldark-was-a-victim-of-cornwalls-changing-industrial-landscape-64631\">represented the economic difficulties experienced by the region during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. </a>\u201cThey\u2019ve been fairly good on historical accuracy,\u201d said Crawford. \u201cThough the characters tend to be too clean, too healthy and their teeth are too good.\u201d </p> <p>Mike Chappell, chair of the campaign group Kernow [Cornwall] Matters To You, praised the programme makers for including some Cornish language while pointing out that it did not delve too deeply into the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3757386/Slave-girls-aged-six-workers-racked-ill-health-ruthless-exploitation-countless-deaths-barbaric-reality-life-Poldark-s-tin-mines.html \">horrors of mining in the region</a>. Two of Chappell\u2019s ancestors perished in the Levant mine disaster of 1919 and a grandfather ran away to sea to escape the mines. \u201cThe truth of our mining heritage is brutal,\u201d said Chappell.</p> <p>Toni Carver, the long-serving editor of the St Ives Times and Echo, said he enjoyed the first series. \u201cIt\u2019s nostalgia, but you\u2019ve only got to visit a pub music session in Cadgwith Cove [on the Lizard Peninsula] or climb and walk through the old mining areas, or sail around the coast to realise a lot of the romance is still here. It\u2019s a magical county, the ghosts of the past are everywhere.</p> <p>\u201cAll these popular books by writers like Daphne du Maurier, Winston Graham [author of the Poldark series] and Rosamunde Pilcher and the TV spin-offs promote Cornwall as a tourist destination and are effective and valuable free promotion for the tourist industry.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddcaca92f99d341b34684a36a4e203850b0b3029\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddcaca92f99d341b34684a36a4e203850b0b3029/0_19_4485_2690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heida Reed playing Elizabeth Poldark\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heida Reed playing Elizabeth Poldark.

So, it\u2019s a double-edged sword.\u201d</p> <p>The makers and cast emphasise how important it is that they film in Cornwall. Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays Demelza, said: \u201cI love Cornwall; it\u2019s glorious and so much the heart of this show. Sometimes you forget the part it plays until you get there and suddenly everything makes sense.\u201d </p> <p>Heida Reed \u2013 Elizabeth Poldark \u2013 said she believed the Cornish people were hugely proud of Poldark. \u201cThey feel like they own a piece of it, which they really do what with the landscape and having had so many Cornish people participate in the production.

  "<p>When Michael Lakey stopped off at his local gas station in Hayden, Alabama, to pick up ice for a barbecue, he was greeted with clenched-teeth hostility by the clerk.</p> <p>Something, he knew, was awry.</p> <p>At the store counter was a stack of copies of <a href=\"http://justbustednews.com/72505/2376/1/home\">Just Busted</a>, a \u201crogue\u2019s gallery\u201d tabloid costing $1 featuring the mugshot photographs of people arrested in the local area and the crimes they are suspected of committing.</p> <p>And inside, on page 20, was a picture of Lakey, 39, a law-abiding metal worker with a wife, Gloria, a one-year-old granddaughter and four foster kids to support.</p> <p>The caption next to his mugshot read, to his shock, \u201cthat I\u2019d been arrested for sexual assault of a child under 12 years old\u201d.</p> <p>The caption was, to put it mildly, erroneous.</p> <p>In May 2009, Lakey had been issued a ticket for driving on expired license plates and duly paid the fine, but the payment had been incorrectly logged into the police computer system. Then just over a year later, he was pulled over again. With no receipt on his person to prove he had paid his fine, he was arrested and had his mugshot taken.</p> <p>And under state public access laws, Just Busted\u2019s publishers could access arrestees\u2019 mugshots from police departments.</p> <p>It later emerged that the Just Busted graphic artist responsible for compiling the issue had mistakenly paired Lakey\u2019s picture with another suspect\u2019s charges.</p> <p>Lakey knew that the chances of people in the community seeing his mugshot with the inaccurate accompanying charge were high \u2013 Just Busted had a circulation of over 10,000 in the area. But he did not anticipate that those he had considered friends and confidants would make a pariah of him.</p> <p>Three days after publication, the door of the Lakey\u2019s house rapped purposefully. On the stoop stood several social workers from the state\u2019s department of human resources, responsible for child protection services.</p> <p>\u201cThey had seen my mugshot and they came out with the intention of taking our foster kids and our granddaughter if we could not prove that my mugshot with those charges was false,\u201d Lakey said in a south Texas brogue.</p> <p>The agony lasted for the four hours it took to reach the Blount County officer responsible for sexual abuse cases, who confirmed that Lakey was not a child molester.</p> <p>Just Busted printed a series of retractions, but locals\u2019 suspicions festered and grew. Death stares on the street escalated.</p> <p>\u201cA few days after the magazine article came out my wife started receiving [anonymous] threatening phone calls from people telling her I was gonna get what I had coming to me and if she knew what was good for her she would pack her and the kids up and leave, that [I was going to] get beat up or killed,\u201d Lakey said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3d9cc6470e464d5a6870e16f5a6373bfd363bac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3d9cc6470e464d5a6870e16f5a6373bfd363bac/0_0_1090_1378/791.png\" alt=\"Michael Lakey\u2019s mugshot in Just Busted erroneously describes him as having been charged with child sex abuse.\" width=\"791\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Lakey\u2019s mugshot in Just Busted erroneously describes him as having been charged with child sex abuse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: none</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their home was vandalised on numerous occasions.</p> <p>Months later, shortly after his wife died, Lakey and his granddaughter packed up and left Hayden for Texas.</p> <p>Then last year, Lakey successfully sued Just Busted for defamation, winning a five-figure sum. He said that publishing mugshots before suspects have been tried undermined a sacred tenet of American jurisprudence and hoped his case would force Just Busted to change its ways.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody\u2019s innocent until proven guilty,\u201d he said before taking the stand in December in Jefferson County court in Birmingham. \u201cBut if you put somebody in a magazine like that you\u2019re already saying that they\u2019re guilty to the community.\u201d</p> <p>His attorney, James Morgan, believes that these publications are not the crime-stopping news organizations they claim to be. \u201c[They] deal in schadenfreude \u2026allowing an audience to view people at their worst and to ridicule them.\u201d He points out Just Busted\u2019s regular \u201cDrunk Tank\u201d and \u201cSticky Fingers\u201d sections in which the inebriated and suspected thieves are singled out for mockery.</p> <p>During testimony, Just Busted\u2019s editor explained how the tabloid is compiled.</p> <p>Matthew DeGlopper, the paper\u2019s editor, explained that he did not employ a copy editor or fact-checker to guard against errors. Each issue is put together by a graphic artist rather than a journalist.</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Lakey is not the paper\u2019s first victim of an egregious error. A previous designer had made five mistakes in seven issues. And in 2014, a Sevierville, Tennessee, man sued Just Busted for defamation, saying he was wrongly described as a rape suspect; that suit was eventually settled.</p> <h2>A \u2018deprivation of liberty\u2019</h2> <p>Just Busted is a major player in the mugshot publication market with titles across several states. But since 2010, copycats have sprouted across the country: Gotcha! covers central Virginia, the Hard Times in Alabama, Green Mountain Mugshots in Vermont, Jailbirds Rocks in Oklahoma. </p> <p>There are others who have been defamed by mugshot magazines, including James Suddarth, a 46-year-old Charlottesville, Virginia, man who successfully sued for defamation in 2012 after the Crime Times wrongly labelled him as a felon who had fired a gun in a public building.</p> <p>Some mugshot websites have also failed in their fact-checking duties. A lawsuit that gained <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/08/mugshot-websites-stop-charging-photo-removal\">national attention in 2014</a> was filed after people complained about being charged hundreds of dollars to remove the mugshots even if the cases against those arrested had been dropped. Two sites eventually settled the suit and agreed to stop charging.</p> <p>Mugshot publications and free-press advocates argue that they are providing a civic service, and one of Just Busted\u2019s owners, Wanda Gilham, said in December that her magazines have led to the capture of fugitives.</p> <p>In 2011, a woman who had been been sexually assaulted three years earlier in Saginaw, Michigan, <a href=\"http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2013/02/first-degree_sexual_assault_co.html\">identified James W Gunn</a> as her attacker only after seeing his picture in a local mugshot magazine after he had been arrested on a separate charge.</p> <p>Scott Ciolek, an Ohio-based attorney who brought the 2014 lawsuit, said that cases such as Lakey\u2019s are extremely hard to win, which does little to incentivise editors to take measures to prevent defamation. </p> <p>\u201cWhen a magazine makes mistakes like this they will argue that the error was made by the local sheriff\u2019s office,\u201d Ciolek said. \u201cAnd in most states, sheriff\u2019s departments have immunity from tort liability.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e49d4d3982259986837cad46e50a277ca471f21a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e49d4d3982259986837cad46e50a277ca471f21a/0_0_508_246/500.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Lakey looking at Just Busted magazine before his case.\" width=\"500\" height=\"242\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Lakey looking at Just Busted magazine before his case.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny McDevitt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ciolek, who says there are at least 200 mugshot publications across the country, went on to say that while regulating mugshot magazines seems unlikely, there are other options available to reign in \u201cfly-by-night operations\u201d. He pointed to the FBI\u2019s discretionary policy on the availability of booking photos as one that could be rolled out to other law enforcement agencies. He also called for magazines to be held to the same defamation standards as an individual rather than a newspaper. </p> <p>\u201cJust like if you were to keep a lion in your backyard and somebody climbs over the fence and gets attacked by it, you are liable as its owner,\u201d Ciolek said.</p> <p>Some states have moved to restrict public access to mugshots. In July, the federal appeals court in Ohio for the sixth circuit ruled 9 to 7 that federal booking photos are no longer public records, with Chief Judge R Guy Cole Jr remarking that \u201cthese images preserve the indignity of a deprivation of liberty, often at the [literal] expense of the most vulnerable among us\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018My reputation completely shredded, that was the worst part\u2019</h2> <p>Gemma, who does not wish to have her real name published, was a well-respected hospital staff nurse in upstate South Carolina.

But after taking the pills, she panicked and called paramedics.</p> <p>She was arrested for theft of a controlled substance.

But after a pre-trial intervention the charges against her were dropped and she has resumed working as a nurse.</p> <p>In Gemma\u2019s case, fault initially lay with administrators at the local county jail who had inputted the wrong charge with her mugshot, but she never received an apology.</p> <p>\u201cAn officer spoke to me and her explanation was \u2018someone clicked the wrong button\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The paper still has the digital issue with Gemma\u2019s front cover mugshot on its Facebook page at the time of writing.

The huge numbers have placed a massive strain on the kingdom\u2019s economy and resources as well as raising security concerns.</p> <p>The crowds began building up when the border with Syria was tightened last November. This meant that people who might previously have passed into Jordan <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=52760#.V7yP0DYrKhc\">began collecting instead in a disputed no man\u2019s land</a>, sometimes known as \u201cthe berm\u201d after the sandy mounds that border the area where refugees have settled.</p> <p>\u201cThey are completely out of options, they are not able to move forward, and can\u2019t go back into Syria,\u201d Thurtle said.</p> <p>On a visit to north Jordan last week, Stephen O\u2019Brien, the UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, described flying over the berm area. \u201cIn between two berms are tens of thousands of tents quite sparsely populated compared to a normal organised refugee camp,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to imagine [what it is like] completely out in the middle of desert \u2026 in very, very hot [conditions], baking in the tents.\u201d</p> <p>From May, some aid groups were allowed in to offer limited supplies of food, water and medical help. The MSF team spent at least six hours a day driving a mobile clinic to reach a \u201cservices area\u201d on the fringe of the camp.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt was an extremely challenging logistical operation, leaving at 6am from the nearest town where we could be based. We had to drive the entire operation for three to four hours, half of it off-road, then return the same way before evening,\u201d a member of the MSF team said. </p> <p>However, even that access was cut off in June, on security grounds, after <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/21/jordanian-soldiers-killed-by-car-bomb-outside-syrian-refugee-camp\">Islamic State militants drove a suicide bomb </a>into a Jordanian army checkpoint and killed at least six soldiers. But Sammonds said there was no connection between the refugees and the attack.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThat suicide vehicle came from some distance to the north and at speed, with no link that I have ever heard of with the would-be refugees,\u201d he said. \u201cI would suspect that Jordan is using the security incident politically to \u2018justify\u2019 its overall closure policy.\u201d</p> <p>Since June, authorities have given permission for one severely ill boy to be evacuated, and allowed aid groups worried about starvation to make a single drop of <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c8b032df75ac49daaeff4c15d8b00271/aid-dropped-crane-reaches-75000-syrians-jordan-border\">food supplies by crane</a>. That was on 4 August. Distribution inside the camp could not be monitored so the most vulnerable may not have received supplies, and since then there has been nothing.</p> <p>There are credible reports of malnutrition, and water supplies are just five or six litres per person in some areas. That is barely enough to meet drinking needs in the sweltering heat, leaving nothing for sanitation, and disease has already set in.</p> <p>\u201cThere is almost certainly a hepatitis outbreak at the berm,\u201d Thurtle said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t witnessed it, but I am pretty confident that is happening.\u201d</p> <p>Credible sources are reporting 30 cases of severe jaundice each day, Thurtle said, and there have been at least 10 deaths in the last month. Hepatitis E is particularly dangerous for pregnant women, with a mortality rate of 20-25%, and there have already been reports of deaths during childbirth.</p> <p>Thurtle is part of a team on standby near the border, currently campaigning to be allowed back in and keep the plight of the refugees on the international radar.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like they don\u2019t exist, they are stuck in purgatory,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen them, nobody has for eight weeks. It\u2019s really easy for them to disappear from the consciousness of the international community, the Jordanian government, everybody.\u201d</p>",

The community has its origins in the Balkan refugee crisis in the 1990s, when Yugoslavia was ripped apart at its seams, displacing millions. Bosnian refugees were resettled in St Louis by the thousands, and eventually the city became the anchor of the United States\u2019 Bosnian diaspora.</p> <p>Historically, Missouri has been a swing state, though is often assumed by pundits to be a Republican giveaway. In 2008, Republican John McCain won the state\u2019s electoral votes by a margin of less than 1% \u2013 mere thousands of votes. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney won the state by 10%, but liberal Democrat Claire McCaskill also kept her seat in the US Senate by more than 15%.

  "<p>Japan\u2019s threat that many of its companies will quit the UK if Brexit negotiations are botched comes with an unprecedented and slightly panicky list of demands. The message to London and Brussels is that Tokyo wants certainty from the outset that every effort will be made to keep the UK\u2019s borders open for people, goods and the complex financial transactions that are the lifeblood of modern global capitalism.</p> <p>In a letter to the EU and UK at the G20 summit in China, Japan says it is representing the needs of businesses that have invested heavily in the UK with a view to exporting across Europe. NIssan\u2019s Washington plant in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, exports more than 80% of the cars it makes. The new Hitachi train factory down the road in Newton Aycliffe is making trains for the UK, but has ambitions to compete with Germany\u2019s Siemens for contracts across the continent.</p> <p>Although the letter says Tokyo respects the referendum vote, the clear demand is for the current arrangements to stay the same for businesses to invest and create jobs. At its heart, the letter implies that UK exports could be jeopardised by a Liam Fox- or David Davis-inspired break with the EU that involves the re-introduction of trade barriers and quotas restricting immigration, whatever the secretary of state for international trade (Fox) or secretary of state for exiting the European Union (Davis) says about their plans for signing deals with other countries.</p> <p>The demands range from the maintenance of low tariffs on exports to keeping various EU agencies in the UK. Some look possible, others almost fanciful. Here we assess the likelihood that the upcoming negotiations can address the concerns of Japanese businesses, beginning with:</p> <ul> <li><em>Maintenance of the current tariff rates and customs clearance procedures</em><br></li> </ul> <p>There is pressure from businesses on both sides of the channel to keep tariffs on goods low and allow lorries to zip back and forth without hindrance. It\u2019s possible the French and German governments will accede to giving the UK special privileges to please Volkswagen and Renault \u2013 which owns 43% of Nissan \u2013 as much as UK exporters concerned at the potential loss of trade.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/g20-theresa-may-warns-of-tough-times-for-uk-economy-after-brexit\">Theresa May joins G20 summit to face Brexit warnings from US and Japan</a> </p> </aside>  <ul> <li><em>Maintenance of the access to workers who are nationals of the UK or the EU</em> <br></li> </ul> <p>It seems likely the Conservative government will adopt a points-based immigration system that will favour skilled workers, alleviating the concerns of Japanese employers at the loss of unfettered access to EU nationals.</p> <ul> <li><em>Maintenance of the freedom of establishment and the provision of financial services, including the \u201csingle passport\u201d system</em><br></li> </ul> <p>UK banks and insurance companies can process transactions without any barriers while they remain part of the EU. The National Institute for Economic &amp; Social Research has said the loss of passporting rights for financial services companies will be a huge blow for London.</p> <ul> <li><em>Maintenance of the freedom of cross-border investment and the provision of services as well as the free movement of capital, including that between associated companies</em><br></li> </ul> <p>London plays host to the financial businesses that process most transactions in euros, to the resentment of Frankfurt and Paris. Appeals to the European court of justice are expected post-Brexit from continental financial centres, seeking to bring all euro transactions with the EU. Most likely they will succeed, robbing London of an important resource.</p> <ul> <li><em>Location within the UK of EU agencies such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the maintenance of the UK\u2019s access to the EU budget for research and development and participation in the Japan-EU joint research project</em><br></li> </ul> <p>Both these requests are almost certain to be denied. Without a doubt, Brussels will pull back all its agencies to inside the EU, probably encouraged by Japan\u2019s statement that its London-based pharmaceutical companies would shift their headquarters across the channel if this happened.</p> <ul> <li><em>Maintenance of basic policies regarding the entry of foreign capital and implementation of measures to promote investment</em><br></li> </ul> <p>There are unlikely to be any barriers put up by the government against foreign investment post-Brexit. If anything, the incentives are likely to increase once EU state-aid rules preventing the UK from subsidising business investment no longer apply. </p> <ul> <li><em>Ensuring the consistency of regulations and standards between the UK and the EU</em><br></li> </ul> <p>Exporters appreciate harmonised regulations, and initially little is expected to change. There will be demands for the UK to develop its own rules, especially when signing trade deals with countries outside the EU, in areas like agriculture.

It\u2019s a fictional story of six orphaned sisters in Turkey who are left under the guardianship of their uncle. He can\u2019t cope and in a bid to control them and marry them off he turns them into prisoners in their own home. But it\u2019s no Fritzl tale about the insane actions of a perverted individual; it\u2019s about a culture of oppression that still exists on the outskirts of an otherwise very modern society. It is a roar of young female power and sexuality and the terrified, controlling patriarchs that try and suffocate and silence it. There is something so raw about the story and the performances, it just ripped through me. I cried so much it was sort of embarrassing. Stories about siblings always tug at my heart as I am so close to my own.

Two people meet and fall in love, but in three different ways, over an entire lifetime.

I have happy travel experiences with friends and years later, family. The sheer beauty of the landscape, the coast, the abandoned mines where several of my ancestors worked. Plus, Cornwall is the only place in the world where people do not ask about the origin of my unusual surname as it comes from old Cornish. When I am in Britain, heading to Cornwall feels like going home. </p> <p>Ten years ago I was left for four days in the UK with my three sons. I had planned to stay in Devon and avoid driving and dealing with English traffic but got lost and ended up in Cornwall. We spent three magical days staying at the Coverak Youth Hostel and touring the region. The weather was splendid and I relished sharing with my children all the things I loved about Cornwall. And I enjoyed the driving too. The boys particular memory of Cornwall however is less illustrious. It involves traipsing through a cow paddock on my most infamous short cut which took us several miles out of our way. The landscape is stunning with a rugged coastline seeped in history, the towns interesting reflecting with a early twentieth century feel.</p> <p>I would describe Cornwall as a little corner of Britain which has been mostly forgotten or overlooked. It has a distinct character that is resistant to change, rather like my Cornish ancestors. </p> <p>My visits to Cornwall have been too brief to have a real appreciation of the culture so my favourite thing about Cornwall is the land itself and the history from ancient to recent industrial that shapes it.</p> <p><strong>Janette Menhennet, Australia</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45e5f9c9f391a83ef2cd7a4658b1400d693e6e33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45e5f9c9f391a83ef2cd7a4658b1400d693e6e33/0_0_3264_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018My most favourite thing is walking along the beaches and cliffs and taking in the magnificent scenery.

Its a spectacular place with a magnificent coastline and a beauty which is overwhelming.</p> <p>The region is very special to me as I have been visiting it all of my life and I never grow tired of it. I discover new things every time I go. It is a magical place with its celtic roots and culture. </p> <p>My most treasured memories are of the years I spent camping every year with my two children and friends on the north coast. Every year I spent there was so special and no matter how tired I felt when I arrived, there was a magic about the place that was completely relaxing and healing. I also built some fantastic memories with my children and they too share my love of the county. </p> <p>Fantastic sandy beaches which stretch for miles along the coastline, huge waves which roll in from the Atlantic on the north coast which make surfing ideal, small quaint fishing villages, beautiful rivers and estuaries, dramatic cliffs and the ruggedness of the moors where the weather can change so quickly and dramatically.<br>Its a perfect place for walking, surfing, exploring or just relaxing </p> <p>It never fails to disappoint me no matter how many times I visit.

It\u2019s a long drive from St. Austell where I live to Porthcurno, but I took the chance and set off. I arrived an hour and a half later to slate grey skies and Biblical rainfall. Far out in the Atlantic was the promised break in the clouds moving swiftly towards me and when it reached the cliffs the light was extraordinary a wonderful orange glow diffused by the spray cast up by the storm. <br></p> <p>Cornwall is my home, it is where I belong and I will never leave it. I love that I can, with a little walking and scrambling, have beaches such as Strangles and Tregardock on the North Coast to myself.

  "<p>Vid is sitting in his winter living room among the large model boats he has carved from driftwood \u2013 everything from galleons to the Titanic. \u201cThis is not a job,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThis is a lifestyle. I came here five years ago to escape the world of business and city life. There are only three rules: no politics, no assumption of status and no grumpiness.\u201d</p> <p>On this Croatian road trip we have reached, it seems, the furthest possible point from cities, politics and grumpiness. Vid is an avuncular presence, gently supervising his hostel-campsite-taverna on the island of Kornat, the largest in the Kornati archipelago, a chain of 140 limestone outcrops off the port of Zadar. Vid has forgotten to mention another rule, actually a necessity, of his kingdom: you cannot drive or walk to it. The only access is by boat or kayak.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a filter,\u201d he says. \u201cPaddlers and sailors are more likely to be good people. They\u2019re friendly and don\u2019t look down on other people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/travel_croatia_week4/giv-31075A8UmdpHCV5NU/\" data-alt=\"Kornati map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/travel_croatia_week4/giv-31075A8UmdpHCV5NU/\">Kornati map</a> </figure>  <p>For us, that has meant paddling. The journey begins when we leave our vehicle in a car park in Zadar. (My question, \u201cWill my laptop be safe inside?\u201d prompts reassurance from a local: \u201cThere is very little crime here. But to be extra sure, lock the car.\u201d) We then catch the passenger ferry to Sali on Dugi Otok \u2013 Long Island. This ferry is our first step towards Vid\u2019s kind of normal: local people heading home from Zadar\u2019s markets laden with fruit, veg and flowers. People who bring their own sandwiches, drink out of thermos flasks and never stop chatting.</p> <p>In Sali, an unpretentious little port, we meet Marko, our guide and kayaking mentor. Over the next four days he\u2019ll take us from our base on Kornat on kayaking day trips to explore the archipelago. Marko likes to talk, and in a jokey conversation held across the waves during a long paddle later on, we decided that if he were a dog, he might be Timmy, the endlessly enthusiastic hound of the Famous Five.</p> <p>We stock up on snacks in Sali, then cycle for 20 minutes to a quiet little bay where we spend an hour packing everything in dry bags and inspecting the conditions out at sea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06866224308d23770bda447d8a0c477f77619765\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06866224308d23770bda447d8a0c477f77619765/0_154_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maddy prepares for the kayak crossing in Croatia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maddy prepares for the kayak crossing</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis wind is the bura,\u201d Marko declares. \u201cBut this is the third day of it, and it will die down soon.\u201d</p> <p>Our tiny flotilla sets out, performing a nervous turn through choppy waves and heading south. My daughter Maddy (13) and I, however, are in a double sea kayak which is as steady as a rock, and when we turn, the wind is at our backs, propelling us quickly around a headland, then through a narrow strait into the necklace of small outer islands that hangs from the neck of Kornat.</p> <p>It is already clear that August is not Kornati\u2019s quietest month. In fact, Italian families with speedboats love to whizz across the Adriatic and then spend an idyllic week or two carving these tranquil waters into white slices. Another summer migrant to spot is the billionaire. You might spy his super-yacht lying sleek and supercilious in a lonely cove, but sighting an actual superhero of capitalism himself is unlikely. (Croatia\u2019s ports are full of gossip about them. One relative of a crew member told me how the flowers, \u20ac5,000-worth, were changed every day, whether anyone was on board or not. As this yacht belonged to a very minor member of the species, I shudder to imagine what other pointless extravagances are perpetrated.)</p> <p>It is also clear, however, that a kayak can take you places no speedboat or superyacht ever will. On our first day out from Vid\u2019s little paradise, Marko leads us to a chain of rocky islets with tough, bleached faces of karstic limestone, anything between a few metres tall to epic edifices as high as St Paul\u2019s cathedral.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6820d0c0540e5bc086e80e493128f983c4c463f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6820d0c0540e5bc086e80e493128f983c4c463f4/0_0_2304_1382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vid in his living room.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vid in his living room</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We have already had a lesson in how to exit a kayak at sea, and climb back aboard. Now it is time to practise. But the bura has been replaced by the mistral, a steady southerly that is rapping insistently on these cliffs. The reflections cause all kinds of wildness and into this we jump. Marko ties the kayaks together and steers away from the cliff. We swim into a mysterious and wonderful little cave, unseen from above the waves. The cliff is deeply undercut and so a theatrical blue light shines from below. After a few minutes we retrieve our boats and climb aboard \u2013 which is actually not as difficult as you might imagine.</p> <p>Next day some of the group want to relax so Marko and I drop them at a lovely shingle beach with a restaurant and head for Mana. This island has truly magnificent cliffs set in a vast overhung amphitheatre, on top of which is a ruined castle. It is actually a film set, built before CGI for some lost epic about the new world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0d66881506dfb66a9cc636f48e219082c7e9832a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d66881506dfb66a9cc636f48e219082c7e9832a/0_50_2304_1382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"aerial shot of kayaks near Kornat, Croatia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Below it, the snorkelling along the edge of a dark deep drop is stunning. Then we paddle over to Baluni island for some deepwater solo climbing. This is Marko\u2019s first love, I feel. He rolls from the kayak, swims strongly to the cliff, and climbs barefoot up a vertical 10-metre crack before leaping off the top and doing it again. My own attempt is fun, but not half as elegant or successful.</p> <p>The days roll by. The initial annoyance with speedboats fades as I realise they all go to the same spots \u2013 the ones we don\u2019t visit. One morning I climb up the hill behind Vid\u2019s place to watch a panorama of islands, ethereal and mysterious in the dawn mist.</p> <p>When we have paddled back to Dugi Otok and cycled to Sali, we are getting down from our bikes when a man approaches and hands out cakes. Who is he? A Marko stooge? No, just a passerby, heading home from the bakery, who felt like handing out delicious buns. Well, if nowhere can ever be paradise, this is about as close as it gets.</p> <h2>Discovering Croatia<strong>:</strong> anyone for picigin?</h2> <p>Croatian beaches in August can be crowded, but don\u2019t rule the popular spots out too readily. Split\u2019s Ba\u010dvice beach, for example, is where the game picigin was invented, and braving the crowds to see it or, even better, take part, is fun. The idea is simply to keep the ball out of the water. Aficionados argue about rules: some say the ball must be a tennis ball with all the fur removed \u2013 handy for using up local hero Goran Ivanesovic\u2019s cast-offs.

  "<p>The Syrian city of Aleppo crumbles into rubble, assailed by Russian bombs, government artillery and chemical weapons. In the heat of battle, Turkish troops and Kurdish fighters turn on one another, fighting their age-old war, though both are supposed to be fighting a common enemy, Islamic State (Isis), advancing on the battered, tortured civilians of Aleppo and other Syrian and Kurdish communities in a murderous pincer movement.</p> <p>So the Middle East continues to implode \u2013 but amid the chaos emerges a further force, perhaps incredibly, a poetic and literary one. It comes in defiant journalism, like the story televised last week of a gardener in Aleppo who was killed by bombs while tending his roses and his son, who helped him, orphaned.</p> <p>And it comes in the verses of two female poets, part of an emergent school of verse, much of it written by women: Bejan Matur and Maram al-Masri \u2013 Kurdish and Syrian respectively. Matur and Masri are the two most illustrious and cogent of this new generation of female poets; their verse combines to create a devastating but richly composed verbal landscape that it is at once epic and intensely human. Raw and lyrical, of the moment but seeped in the memories of their people, immediate and for ever.</p> <p>The two women write very differently. Masri\u2019s poetry vividly encapsulates the frailty of our human condition in a brutal society. It can flay you at first reading. It is fair to see Masri as a love poet whose verse spares no truth of love\u2019s joys and mercilessness, to whose work war then came, as it tore her native Syria apart, and overwhelmed it, and her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m Kurdish, and you learn early that others do not regard or accept the land in which you are born as your own</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Matur\u2019s verse is more mystical: it sublimates the political and politicises the sublime; it locates her people\u2019s wandering within a philosophical meditation on both the meaning and emptiness of being. While Masri\u2019s verse is modern, and modern war poetry of the cruellest order, Matur\u2019s evokes the Romantics, Coleridge and Emily Bront\u00eb. Both record, with power and sentient humanity, the vortex of war in our world today, and the millions these wars scatter and shatter across it, not least to Europe\u2019s shores.</p> <p>\u2018For me, only through writing poetry can I reach my own horizons,\u201d says Matur. We\u2019re talking in a cafe by the river Lee in Cork, after a discussion of her work in the city library. During the discussion, she had confronted the fact that all her poetry until now was written in Turkish, rather than her native Kurdish, the banned, therefore private language of home and family.</p> <p>But in the library, she had read aloud her first Kurdish poems. \u201cMy mother corrected me,\u201d she told the audience. \u201cShe pointed out, for instance, the different Kurdish words for \u2018to turn around\u2019 and \u2018to return\u2019 \u2013 I had used the wrong one. So there was my mother, who cannot read, becoming my editor!\u201d</p> <p>Now Matur reflects on these origins. \u201cWe lived a happy life, but it was always confined; even as a child I was aware of this. I\u2019m Kurdish, and you learn early that others do not regard or accept the land in which you are born as your own.\u201d</p> <p>Now, repression in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/erdogan-reprisals-turkey-attempted-military-coup\">failed coup against Turkey\u2019s President Erdo\u011fan</a> moves against all Alevi Kurds, like Matur\u2019s family \u2013 seen not only as enemies of the state, but also as heretics by its aggressive Islamicisation. \u201cNo one feels safe,\u201d she says, as pro-regime mobs stage incursions into Kurdish communities.</p> <p>Matur was born in 1968, in the ancient Hittite city of Mara\u015f, in Turkey\u2019s south-eastern corner, Iraq to the south, Iran to the east. \u201cI was a bookish little girl,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Her student days in the late 1980s were dominated by Saddam Hussein\u2019s persecution and gassing of Matur\u2019s fellow Kurds across the border in Iraq, and Turkey\u2019s less dramatic but unrelenting persecution of Kurdishness, let alone its political expression. \u201cAnd so my idea, my notion, of being Kurdish became more fundamental to me.\u201d As a law student in Ankara \u201cKurdish students were suspected, and arrested for their activities, and I was one of them.\u201d</p> <p>Matur, arrested and jailed for 12 months in 1988-9, explains how she began writing poems in prison. She recently went to a family wedding in Switzerland, at which she met her parents and relatives and friends she had not seen since childhood, such is diaspora life. \u201cAt the wedding, my father and I were trying to calculate how long I had been held in solitary confinement during my detention,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought it was for 18 days; my father corrected me \u2013 it had been 28. And that was very strange for me, because there was no way of knowing. I was held in total darkness, alone \u2013 a place in which there was no time. It was up to those outside, my father, to count the days.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"948d1e3ed1e59a31411e198673516bf32f46aa33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/948d1e3ed1e59a31411e198673516bf32f46aa33/0_158_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman inspects the damage after an airstrike in the Bab al-Nairab neighborhood of Aleppo, Syria, August 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman inspects the damage after an airstrike in the Bab al-Nairab neighborhood of Aleppo, Syria, August 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abdalrhman Ismail/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was \u201cin that dark cell that the interrogations began. That\u2019s how your world is taken from you, in pure, total darkness. And when the interrogations stopped, I thought: \u2018I can\u2019t just try to count time in this timeless dark, I have to find another way to feel my being\u2019. That\u2019s how I started writing poetry. In my head. To bring back to life an existence they were trying to obliterate. My poems are about the reconstruction of a shattered being.</p> <p>\u201cI started to focus on this way of survival. Words \u2013 and with them the reality of being \u2013 became visible to me. I had a pen and paper in my head, and was speaking the words silently to myself. As in our oral tradition, the words had rhythm, a kind of music \u2013 in jail, you cannot feel the energy to sing, but the words gave me balance in the darkness. I was not theirs any more.\u201d</p> <p>Matur and her fellow students had been arrested for suspected membership of the insurgent Kurdish political movement, \u201cbut they couldn\u2019t find anything \u2013 being Kurdish was enough to get arrested\u201d. After being held for eight months, she was cleared by a court hearing \u2013 \u201cbut when I got to the prison gates, my father waiting for me, the police arrested me again, for nothing. They even burned all the poetry I had written while in prison after solitary confinement. When I was finally released by the police, I ended up back to jail for another four months, depressed, collapsed, broken \u2013 I wanted to die.\u201d</p> <p>But in the aftermath of this nightmare, Matur spoke at an Amnesty International conference, and for the first time \u201cfound the energy to share my story\u201d. She wrote what became a defiant bestseller in Turkey, <em>Looking Behind the Mountain</em>, a collection of Kurdish voices, simply but intelligently \u2013 therefore explosively \u2013 collated. It begins with an essay, in which Matur says: \u201cWe need a person like Mahatma Gandhi\u201d.</p> <p>Matur has been writing poetry for many years \u2013 her first book was published in 1996, winning many literary prizes, and there have been more awards since. The critic John Berger writes of her work: \u201cIts aim is to outwit nonsense by outflanking it. It does so, it succeeds. Once everything was and so nothing existed. This nothing then broke into fragments, into shards which were real. And on these existent shards were written obscure phrases, which she, the poet, today transcribes. The reader does not follow word by word, but hand in hand, to touch and recognise piece after piece in the dark.\u201d</p> <p>A first volume of her poetry, <em>In the Temple of a Patient God</em>, was published in English in 2003. \u201cTo read Bejan Matur\u201d, writes Maureen Freely in the introduction, \u201cis to walk in a windswept desert strewn with bones and broken bodies and stones stained red by absent gods \u2026 It is a haunted, desolate and fragmented landscape.\u201d</p> <p>Both Freely and translator Ruth Christie invoke <em>Wuthering Heights </em>in Matur\u2019s references to \u201cmansions howling with winds\u201d. As with Beckett, whom Matur admires, \u201cI understood /time passes./Going is not going/staying is not staying\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Poetry should be an anti-weapon, a means of abating the weapons</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then, inescapably, there is war. \u201cThese are not autobiographical works,\u201d writes Freely. \u201cMatur is writing about a people, not a person.\u201d Matur writes of a refugee people, like those who haunt our nightly news bulletins now: \u201cBirds hovered between earth and sky./Now the tribe cannot possibly survive/they said and flew away./We believed the birds/in their flurry,/that the tribe would not survive./With the tremulous souls/of all migrant peoples/we peered about us./First at the mountains/then the plain.\u201d</p> <p>Matur speaks with a curious combination of passionate engagement and ethereal quality. As befits her poetry: the rock of ages, the sources of rivers, the counsel of ancestors are as much a part of the cast as she is.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t use a political language, but my poetry is very political. Poetry is about the meaning beyond, about why we exist, what is the meaning of our being? At some level, these inevitably become political questions too.</p> <p>\u201cI have travelled like a nomad,\u201d she says. \u201cbut when I return to my village and sit with my mother, I am back among my people. I want to say: we are not invisible, as Turkey says we are. We have a culture, we have a language, and we want to be seen. What I try to understand is the meaning of our existence, and if you do that, you take a political position, you state an act of resistance.\u201d</p> <p>After her ordeal at the hands of the Turkish regime, and now renewed threats to her friends and colleagues, Matur seeks to establish herself in the UK, where she has family. Some months after our meeting in Ireland, walking in Kenwood, London, she says: \u201cThe moment you fight against the terrible order of things on its own terms, you join it. You have to find another way, and poetry is about finding another way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bdd9a49334616fb3db78457be64630c4412af72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bdd9a49334616fb3db78457be64630c4412af72/215_915_5799_3480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bejan Matur: \u2018Poetry is about finding another way.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bejan Matur: \u2018Poetry is about finding another way.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maram al-Masri remains at the table outside a cafe in Paris while I go in to pay the bill; when I return, her eyes have filled, and she licks a tear from the corner of her mouth. \u201cLook at him,\u201d she says, of a handsome, smiling face on her phone. \u201cHe\u2019s just been killed. By murderers from the Assad regime. A journalist, and photographer. Yet another one, another friend. It happens every day, every time I check the news from Syria.\u201d</p> <p>His name was Khaled al-Issa, \u201ca lovely man, good at his job, kind, gentle \u2013 look!\u201d, she says, and shows me a video of Khaled feeding a songbird perched on his finger with birdseed placed on his own tongue.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like prolonged torture,\u201d says Masri, \u201cwaiting, knowing, not knowing, wondering: who next of my friends and family? And all the other people, every day.\u201d It is only later that Masri informs me that her own son, whom she has not seen for 13 years, was among the rebels when the demonstrations started. \u201cI asked him: did you join the revolution? And he said yes, and I was so happy \u2013 I would have felt bad if he\u2019d said no.\u201d</p> <p>With the noose tightening around Aleppo, Masri says: \u201cAleppo is the final revenge against the city that was the cradle of the peaceful revolution - a genocide against everyone that does not flee all they have, and the graves of their families. I follow every moment.</p> <p>\u201cThey say poetry is a weapon, but I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she continues. \u201cWhy should poems be weapons? If they are, they simply take us back to the war. Poetry should be an anti-weapon, a means of abating the weapons.\u201d The implosion of her country tears at her every waking hour \u201cand my sleep too. I dream about the war. I am there and I\u2019m not there. I am here, but my family and friends are there in Syria \u2013 most of all, my people are there.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/aug/19/a-week-in-aleppo-syria-in-pictures\">A week in Aleppo - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Masri\u2019s poetry is not Sassoon for our time \u2013 it\u2019s more complicated, postmodern, differently tortured than that: this is war poetry from the diaspora, from those who are not there, scattered into limbo. There is a poem about how \u201cWe are the exiles/we live on the pills of sedation/\u2026 We sleep embracing our mobile phones/To the light from our screens.\u201d</p> <p>Later, Masri picks at dinner: \u201cI can feel the thirst, the hunger, as though I\u2019m living with them, even though I\u2019m here.\u201d She occupies a tiny room in Montparnasse, \u201cwith hardly any daylight \u2013 but I like this neighbourhood. Half of me is here, half of me is there. It\u2019s a kind of double way of living.\u201d</p> <p>Masri was born in the Mediterranean coastal city of Latakia, where she grew up in what she describes as a crossroads between Arab roots \u201cand nurturing ourselves with Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Leonard Cohen\u201d. An avid reader and writer as a child, her parents knew French and she studied English literature at Damascus University. Masri began publishing poetry in magazines across the Arab world during the 1970s; during the 1980s, she moved to France, living between her native and adoptive countries. In 1987, she published a first volume, followed 10 years later by a singular book called <em>A Red Cherry on a White-tiled Floor</em>.</p> <p>These are love poems with a difference, which helped Masri claim the Adonis prize, named after the world\u2019s most famous living poet in Arabic.</p> <p>The book deals not with broken hearts, nor even bruised lust, but with passion \u2013 never ambivalent, but often taking ambivalent, even perilous, directions. It deals with adultery and lies, indeed subjugation to lies: \u201cGive me your lies/I will wash them/and tuck them in the innocence of my heart/and make them facts.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"486d14a6c67cb89183aeccc5cd6aece639bccb5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/486d14a6c67cb89183aeccc5cd6aece639bccb5b/0_234_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women walk through the rubble of a neighbourhood in Aleppo, Syria, 30 August 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women walk through the rubble of a neighbourhood in Aleppo, Syria, 30 August 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abdalrhman Ismail/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBefore the war,\u201d says Masri, \u201cthe woman in me was my universe, my source of inspiration. I became fragile, I paid a price. It was like baring yourself naked in front of people. [My husband\u2019s lawyer] used my poems in the divorce case against me. The judge agreed with him that my poetry was not compatible with marriage, with the mind of a good, faithful wife.\u201d</p> <p>Masri was honoured in French literary circles for a fourth collection in 2009, translated into English as <em>Barefoot Souls</em>. \u201cI wrote about my small world, what I had: my heart,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then there were the windows I had opened on to other people\u2019s worlds, as a woman, mother, wife, housekeeper.\u201d</p> <p>The book establishes the poetic world Masri had wrought before Syria\u2019s carnage, before her theme of love was engulfed by what is supposed to be love\u2019s nemesis, war. Only Masri\u2019s account of love is so painfully as well as sensually layered, they are not opposites at all.</p> <p>The book consists mainly of portraits of women and thereby womanhood, each short poem representing the voice of an individual. We are taken into the worlds of her cast, starting with a droll, poignant poem that recalls the Beatles ballad Eleanor Rigby \u2013 about Betty the retired schoolmistress and her cat, Katheline, which is \u201cdetested by everyone/except Betty/who loves nobody/except Katheline\u201d.</p> <p>Then the poetry transgresses boldly into the taboo of doctrinaire Islamic customs that would become a part of Syria\u2019s nightmare, and latterly that in France: Fatima, aged 12, is \u201cconfined to a corner/to make her understand that from now on/she is/eligible for marriage and childbearing\u201d. She ends up finding her man, but abandoned and \u201cselling her gold bracelet\u201d in order to \u201cpurchase a new virginity. But her childhood/that/she can never buy back.\u201d</p> <p>In another, Atife asks whether her love of life and a sense of her womanhood are crimes: to \u201ctouch the essence of earth\u201d, \u201clet my hair float free\u201d, \u201cput colour on my lips/to say that I have a mouth.\u201d The poem reads like a celebration of existence itself, until that existence is abruptly ended in the final stanza: \u201cIs it a crime to live in a country/where freedom/is hanged by the neck?\u201d The country is Iran; the story is true; the girl was hanged for her feminine <em>joie de vivre</em>.</p> <p>Masri tackles the barbarism of female genital mutilation: Aminata from Senegal has \u201ca living sorrow/that bleeds\u201d between her legs. \u201cThey cut it away/morsel by morsel \u2026 They said proudly: \u2018We have cut off the head of Satan.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/14/very-quiet-foreign-girls-poetry-foyle-young-poets-kate-clanchy\">The Very Quiet Foreign Girls poetry group  | Kate Clanchy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But now comes the war: now the shells start falling, the chemicals burn, the sieges begin and continue in Aleppo, Homs and Masri\u2019s home town.

Some of the raped women are killed by their own families \u2013 they\u2019re said to have brought shame on them. One woman in Turkey told me she had lost her three boys, lost everything \u2013 home, children. There was so much suffering in her eyes \u2013 how can I help such a person ? You can give money, I can read them what words I have. I\u2019m not a heroine, nor could I be one. But they listen carefully; often they cry when I read, and talk to me about what has befallen them.

He posed for selfies and held up a baby.</p> <p>Trump had not been expected to address the congregation, having sat beforehand for a privately taped interview with Jackson that was due to be edited and published later on Saturday. In the event, he said he would read some remarks he had written several days earlier.</p> <p>Trump is not known for his strong Christianity: asked last year at an evangelical event in Iowa <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sWzJZMTNd4\">if he had ever sought God\u2019s forgiveness</a>, he said that he had not. Accordingly, he has struggled among white evangelical voters. In Detroit, his speech was heavily focused on faith and the importance of black churches through US history.</p> <p>Reading from a script and adopting a milder tone than that familiar from campaign rallies and debates, the billionaire businessman said: \u201cWe\u2019re all brothers and sisters and we\u2019re all created by the same God. We must love each other and support each other and we\u2019re in this all together.</p> <p>\u201cI fully understand that the African American community is suffering from discrimination and there are many wrongs that must still be made right. They will be made right. I want to make them right.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s from the pews and pulpits [and] Christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the civil rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation. </p> <p>\u201cThere is perhaps no action our leaders can take that would do more to heal our country and support our people than to provide a greater platform to the black churches and churchgoers.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also noted that the Republican party was the party of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president, who defeated the slave-owning Confederacy in the civil war and signed the emancipation proclamation.</p> <p>\u201cBecoming the nominee of the party of Abe Lincoln has been the greatest honor of my life,\u201d said Trump. \u201cIt is on his legacy that I hope to build the future of the party, but more importantly the future of the nation.\u201d</p> <p>Trump did not focus on crime and law and order, as he has done when speaking to white audiences, or touch on police violence against the black community, gun violence or mass incarceration \u2013 major African American issues that the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, has discussed on the campaign trail. Instead, he focused on jobs.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here today to learn so that we can together remedy injustice in any form and so that we can remedy economics so that the African American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and many different ways,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>\u2018Detroit\u2019s only gone through bankruptcy once\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"833be2b2535bf79a6b20fa26e302310bd5044ef5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/833be2b2535bf79a6b20fa26e302310bd5044ef5/0_73_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Detroit Trump protesters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters march outside the church.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Cook/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/03/citizens-united-david-bossie-trump-campaign\">Trump's new hire David Bossie has decades-long history attacking Clintons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Outside, protests continued. A group of clergy from across metropolitan Detroit denounced Trump\u2019s visit. The Rev Lawrence Glass said Trump\u2019s message to the black community and minorities \u2013 asking \u201cwhat do you have to lose\u201d through a vote for the Republican \u2013 was not genuine.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do we have to lose?\u201d Glass said. \u201cHow about voting rights, civil rights, human rights?\u201d </p> <p>The mayor of Detroit, Mike Duggan, also criticised Trump\u2019s decision to speak in his city and attacked the businessman on economic lines. At a press conference, in a restatement of remarks at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July, Duggan said: \u201cThe difference between Donald Trump and Detroit is Detroit\u2019s only gone through bankruptcy once.\u201d </p> <p>The city is attempting to leave behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/18/detroit-formally-files-bankruptcy\">the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history</a>. In his speech to the Detroit Economic Club <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/donald-trump-economic-speech-detroit-michigan-locals-angry\">last month</a>, Trump sought to use the city as an illustration of Democratic party policies that he said produced \u201csilenced victims\u201d. Duggan noted key improvements, particularly falling rates of homicide and unemployment. </p> <p>Detroit\u2019s police chief, James Craig, told reporters at the church he had spoken to Trump for about 30 seconds, and said the Republican nominee told him: \u201cThanks for making us safe.\u201d As of 11.45am no arrests had been made, Craig said. Activists claimed a woman\u2019s shoulder was broken by a police officer during a brief confrontation prior to the service.<br></p> <p>When events inside the church were over, attendees said Trump had received a warm welcome. Frank Bailey, 69, had driven in from Farmington Hills, a suburb about 20 miles north-west of the city. He said he enjoyed the service, having been concerned about how Trump would be received, due to his low polling among African Americans.</p> <p>\u201cI think at the beginning [of the service] it was slow, but the more he talks and the more he said and the more genuine he seemed to become, I guess, I felt that they really warmed up to him,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Jacquelyn Rhodes, a pastor at New Light Christian Ministries in Detroit, said Trump offered substantive remarks. A lifelong independent, Rhodes said the visit had bolstered her support for the Republican. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nobody had any animosity toward him because we\u2019re all Christians</p> <footer> <cite>Cynthia Price</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t my first choice during the primaries,\u201d Rhodes said, \u201cbut I do support Donald Trump.

The mayor highlighted one question Jackson intended to ask \u2013 \u201cAre you a Christian and do you believe the Bible is an inspired word of God?\u201d \u2013 and said: \u201cDonald Trump can\u2019t answer that question to a minister without going through scriptwriters and consultants.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the most phony major party candidate I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>After Trump\u2019s address, Jackson presented him with a Jewish Heritage Study Bible, a prayer shawl and a pin. Wrapping Trump in the shawl, Jackson said it was from Israel and added that he had prayed and fasted over it.</p> <p>Thanking the presidential candidate for his speech, Jackson declared that he had another title for Trump: \u201cPreacher.\u201d</p>",

Indeed, the performance can\u2019t be sustained unless we support it with our credulity, like a tentful of rubes gaping at the tricks of a carnival magician, even offering ourselves up as subjects.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We wanted heat. We wanted him to call liars liars, idiots idiots. We wanted him to bully the bullies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The wishful thinking that is the source of this credulity is, of course, a prelude to disappointment if our candidate actually gets elected. Take the case of candidate Barack Obama. He was going to get us out of Iraq and Afghanistan, and close Guant\u00e1namo. He would save our failing economy, mend our broken healthcare system, and enact sensible gun control legislation. He would overhaul our immigration system, address climate change with meaningful policies, and change the bilious tone of our political discourse. We weren\u2019t a nation of red states and blue states, he reminded us: we were the United States. Despite my years, I believed \u2013 believed not only that he meant what he said, but that he could get it done.</p> <p>My wife and I gathered several friends on a November night in 2008, and watched with joy and disbelief as this young, literary, ironical man with a Kenyan father was elected to the presidency. Some of us had tears in our eyes. I was one. But as time went on those tears began to burn. He wasn\u2019t getting it done, or so it seemed to me. Guant\u00e1namo was still in business. The planet kept heating up, and the wars dragged on, though increasingly waged by special forces. As before, just about anybody was free to walk into a gun store and come out armed, and each year some 30,000 Americans continued to pay for that freedom with their lives.</p> <p>And the tone of political life had become even more toxic than before the election. During President Obama\u2019s first State of the Union address, a congressman from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/10/you-lie-joe-wilson-obama-speech\" title=\"\">South Carolina shouted: \u201cYou lie!\u201d</a> and became a Republican hero, even as the leaders of that party dedicated themselves to obstructing President Obama\u2019s legislative initiatives and judicial appointments, effectively disabling the government in order, as the senate majority leader shamelessly admitted, to make Obama a one-term president. The birthers continued to question his legitimacy, and, further, to imply that he was a secret Muslim and supporter of Isis. He was Hitler. He was Lenin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e56117a38f01fbd094540f19d141d7eeec2b9ae9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e56117a38f01fbd094540f19d141d7eeec2b9ae9/0_137_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Obamacare supporters react to the US Supreme Court decision to uphold President Obama\u2019s health care law, 28 June, 2012, Washington, DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obamacare supporters react to the US Supreme Court decision to uphold President Obama\u2019s health care law, 28 June, 2012, Washington, DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Wilson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>None of this of this was Obama\u2019s fault. Indeed, he reacted to the unrelenting stream of slander and congressional malfeasance with unflappable calm and an air of faintly amused detachment. And for that I did blame him. The coolness I had admired during his campaign became an irritant. In fact, it drove me sort of crazy. Why didn\u2019t he fight back? Show some rage at what was truly outrageous, the obstruction, the name-calling, the attacks on Michelle Obama for encouraging schools to serve healthy food, even for occasionally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/04/fashion-michelleobama\" title=\"\">wearing dresses that showed her arms</a>? Call these liars and bullies out, damn it! Politics is mud wrestling, did he not understand that? And if he really didn\u2019t feel anger, then why not take some acting lessons, and fake it?</p> <p>Well, I was wrong. As Barack Obama prepares to leave office, I think about what he managed to do in the face of implacable resistance. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/24/obama-guantanamo-bay-closure-republicans\" title=\"\">No, he didn\u2019t close Guant\u00e1namo</a>; the Republican congress wouldn\u2019t let him, nor would they let him bring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/05/what-obama-said-on-gun-control-doesnt-matter-republicans-oppose-it\" title=\"\">sanity to our gun laws</a>, or to our immigration policies. But as most economists agree, his financial initiatives, narrowly approved, did save us from a profound recession, possibly even a depression. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/aug/06/auto-industry-obama-bailout\" title=\"\">successful auto industry bailout</a>, fiercely contested at the time, saved countless jobs at virtually no expense to the taxpayer. If Obama couldn\u2019t entirely extricate us from the wars he inherited, he has refrained from entangling us in new wars, despite being constantly urged to do so by congressmen and senators who otherwise refuse to spend tax dollars \u2013 on, say, education, or roads, or environmental safeguards.</p> <p>Finally, 20 million <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/28/obama-healthcare-reform-key-provisions\" title=\"\">Americans who&#xa0;did not have health insurance</a> when Barack Obama took office have it now; and in spite of dire Republican predictions, and umpteen votes for repeal, it has actually lowered the healthcare cost inflation rate. No one in this country, however poor, or sick, need be without insurance. This achievement eluded Theodore Roosevelt and Bill Clinton, among others.</p> <p>So why has Obama not been celebrated for what he\u2019s done? Why did so many of us so often feel a sense of impatience, even disappointment? I believe it comes down to immaturity \u2013 in us, not him. At least part of the reason for our failure to recognise and praise what he\u2019s accomplished has to do with his style \u2013 that coolness. He doesn\u2019t brag, or gloat. He doesn\u2019t call attention to himself, or proclaim his deeds in the thoroughfares, or ridicule those who oppose him. But we wanted him to. We wanted heat. We wanted anger, slashing rhetoric, mockery. We wanted him to call liars liars, idiots idiots. We wanted him to bully the bullies. We wanted him to wage war, and crow over his fallen enemies. And because we did not get the melodrama we demanded, we lost the plot.</p> <p>But now we have a candidate who will give us all the sound and fury we could ask for, or imagine. Let\u2019s see how we like it.

But I had a hope that we were about to move past the worst of our racial history. Right now, America is at a crossroads. The Obama presidency can move us forward, or we can backslide into racial intolerance and violence for good. One of the effects of Obama being elected is that there is a level of racism in America that can no longer be ignored. If a man like Barack Obama, so well-educated, so graceful, so intelligent, so charming, can be so reviled and denigrated on a daily basis in some parts of the country and in Congress (to the point that he can hardly do his job), you can no longer as a normal American ignore the profound problem of race in this country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f4c73953412b135a39a7e8521615a3dc8e4eca6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f4c73953412b135a39a7e8521615a3dc8e4eca6/39_90_1261_723/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama\" width=\"1000\" height=\"573\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack and Michelle Obama: \u2018We\u2019re just beginning to see what this man and his wife together are going to do for the country. \u2018</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are a lot of well-meaning white folks who for years could not see the breadth of racism in America, so I feel that one of the gifts of Obama\u2019s presidency \u2013 a perverse gift \u2013 is the fact it allowed a sickness to bubble up to the surface, like a boil on the skin. You can\u2019t treat what you can\u2019t see. And now that we see it, maybe there\u2019s a chance to treat this racial sickness for good.</p> <p>As for my feelings about Obama, the man himself, I think he\u2019s done a lot of positive things. He got dumped with an economy in freefall in 2009 but he\u2019s managed to turn it around. And his healthcare reforms were humongous, as big to me as stuff that Lyndon Johnson did back in the 60s, like creating Medicare. Of course he\u2019s done things that I do not agree with. I have a problem with the failure to close Guant\u00e1namo, I have a problem with drone strikes around the world. But you\u2019re never going to like everything that any president does. What I\u2019m not going to do is hold Obama to a higher standard, where he has to be a magical negro who is perfect. He\u2019s allowed to make missteps.</p> <p>I think we\u2019re just beginning to see what this man and his wife together are going to do for the country. He\u2019s done what he can within the office of the presidency, but now I think he could be like Jimmy Carter, who has done some incredible work since leaving office. We\u2019re just seeing the beginning of Obama\u2019s power as a human being. <strong>As told to Killian Fox</strong></p> <h2>Hari Kunzru: \u2018His rhetorical skill soothed the terror induced by his blackness\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"653f1e541c75ea4010862fe0e24f3c64b5ea3fc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/653f1e541c75ea4010862fe0e24f3c64b5ea3fc7/0_132_4368_2780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hari Kunzru\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hari Kunzru: \u2018His clearest legacy is symbolic.\u2019<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>British novelist Hari Kunzru left London for New York eight years ago.

It\u2019s hard for non-Americans (and, indeed, non-whites) to understand the psychic blow dealt to the nativist right by the ascent of a black man to the White House. That part of the Republican base that abandoned the Democrats after the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, and which has been so irresponsibly indulged by the party of Lincoln, took the news like medieval villagers witnessing an eclipse. We\u2019ve now spent eight years watching Republican congressmen scurrying hither and thither brandishing pitchforks, outraged at the latest whiff of terrorist fist-bumpery.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Obama has always been a cautious centrist Democrat, not a man likely to align himself with the politics of black power</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The obstructionist opposition to Obama came tricked out in 18th-century Founders\u2019 drag, bewigged and buckle-shoed. Ostensibly they were angry that the framers of the constitution were being traduced by a stoner Kenyan community organiser, yet beneath the surface, their grievances often turned out to be rooted in the erosion of the racial deference that has been expected in this country since the days when Jefferson and Washington toured their slave quarters .</p> <p>The presence of a black first family in the White House, the nation\u2019s lifestyle fishbowl, is just as symbolically powerful as the sight of a black husband and father shouldering the responsibilities of the presidency. In their immaculate media presentation, the Obamas have communicated themselves to the readers of the kind of magazines found in supermarket checkouts as a family whose dignity and essential decency are well sheathed in the necessary American armour of glamour. Whoever wins the presidency in November, the first spouse will command a fraction of the respect that Michelle Obama enjoys. The sight of the two Obama daughters, young black women growing up with unlimited aspirations in a loving home, begs a response from a country where the number one cause of death for black women aged 15-34 is homicide by a current or former partner.</p> <p>Many of the young people driving the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter movement</a> came of age during the Obama presidency, their political consciousness formed by the 2008 election. For them, Obama turned out to be more hope than change, and his failure to speak in a full-throated way in their support has felt like a betrayal,&#xa0;but once the thick rind of symbolism has been peeled, the president has always been a cautious&#xa0;centrist Democrat with an instinct for consensus, not a man likely to align himself with the politics of black power.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d9ffa28b259de0ab5fc2f7a010a58bb318bc948\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d9ffa28b259de0ab5fc2f7a010a58bb318bc948/0_0_3512_2098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a US Air Force MQ-1B Predator drone at a secret air base in the Persian Gulf\" width=\"1000\" height=\"597\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The drone war is considered in many parts of the world the administration\u2019s signal moral disaster\u2019: a US Air Force MQ-1B Predator drone at a secret air base in the Persian Gulf:</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In policy terms, the Obama legacy is mixed. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/live/2015/jun/25/supreme-court-rules-obamacare-healthcare-law\" title=\"\">passing of the Affordable Care Act</a> has curbed some of the more egregious iniquities of the dysfunctional US healthcare system, but hundreds of thousands of Americans still go bankrupt every year because of medical bills. Eight years after the financial crisis, the president has succeeded in keeping the wheels on American capitalism, but once the dust settled, it became clear that the crash accelerated the transfer of wealth from the middle class to the very rich, an injustice he has done nothing to address.</p> <p>Middle Eastern policy has been rudderless. There were, to be honest, no good options available after the squalid disaster of the Bush wars, but Obama\u2019s vacillation about engagement helped produce the chaos in Libya and the vacuum in Syria so ruthlessly exploited by Isis and the Russians. He allowed \u201cred lines\u201d to be crossed without sanction. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/20/americas-drone-policy-all-exceptions-no-rules-yemen\" title=\"\">The drone war</a>, considered in many parts of the world as the administration\u2019s signal moral disaster, has carried on with little serious domestic opposition. The failure to close Guant\u00e1namo is, in the scheme of things, the least of these failures. Only time will tell whether the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/18/obama-iran-deal-weekly-address-world-safer-republican-opposition\" title=\"\">vaunted Iran deal</a> produces a harvest of peace and stability.</p> <p>And yet Obama will be missed. Sometimes, out of his extensive rhetorical tool kit, the president pulls a weird folksy tone, a subliminal suggestion of Merle Haggard, designed, no doubt, to soothe the terror induced by his blackness. Desperate as it is to go on a psychic vacation in the magical kingdom of the \u201cpost-racial\u201d, America will discover that it was lucky to have had a figure capable of such virtuosic code-switching, a man who demonstrated that it was possible to communicate across the lines.</p> <h2>Jayne Anne Phillips: \u2018Just by being who he is&#xa0;he has made an enormous impact\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1c80c3cc95be6b3bc15f1b54451ae4e13636f83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1c80c3cc95be6b3bc15f1b54451ae4e13636f83/0_759_2912_2154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Author Jayne Anne Phillips\" width=\"1000\" height=\"740\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jayne Anne Phillips: \u2018Obama has been a stealth president.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon &amp; Sc</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Guggenheim fellow </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/11/fiction.familyandrelationships\" title=\"\"><em>Jayne Anne Phillips</em></a><em> won the 1980 Sue Kaufman prize for first fiction when she was only 26, for her debut book of stories, Black Tickets.

People forget that when he assumed the presidency in 2009, he was handed a financial disaster in the making and his response to it really saved the country, and possibly the world, from financial collapse. But he\u2019s done so much more. In the two years in which he had a Democratic Congress, he passed the Affordable Care Act and oversaw a $36bn dollar expansion in Pell Grants, which very much affects students at Rutgers University-Newark, where I direct the MFA programme.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Obama\u2019s presidency marks an honourable few years in American history.

He has worked hard to fight climate change. Solar energy production has increased 30-fold since he became president. Jobs in the solar industry have grown exponentially, and he\u2019s leading the effort to phase out damaging hydrofluorocarbons used in air conditioning. His presidency has accomplished so much of which citizens are not aware. He has embraced executive actions, unwilling&#xa0;to accept the stasis Congress embodies.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the whole leadership case. He can\u2019t end racism and sexism in America, but just by being who he is, he\u2019s made an enormous impact. I think he is truly a visionary who is uniquely qualified to serve.

It\u2019s like going from the sublime to \u2013 if Trump is actually elected \u2013 the ridiculously dangerous. It\u2019s a very strange time in this country and we can only hope that Trump will&#xa0;continue to implode. Hillary Clinton is exceptionally qualified and I think she\u2019d be a good president; American sexism plays a huge part in her supposed \u201cunlikability\u201d. She might not be as inspiring as Obama, she\u2019s not cool or chic, but she is such a policy wonk, so prepared and careful. And constant. Her priorities \u2013 children, families, justice \u2013 are the same after 30 years. Yet she is suspected because she has breached the establishment. I\u2019m just praying she\u2019ll win. If Trump wins, there\u2019ll be a lot of people in America trying to marry Canadians.</p> <p>Obama has been a inspiring and provocative leader. The fact that this is more or less the consensus around the world really matters, because it means he\u2019s not vulnerable to the sniping and griping, to the ridiculous \u201cgo low, no, go lower\u201d tone that Trump has set in this election. I don\u2019t think anything will change the fact that Obama\u2019s presidency marks an honourable few years in American history. He is Trump\u2019s polar opposite. What a country this is, to nurture and succour two such opposite cultural/political beings. The best and the worst have moved further and further apart; we are a completely divided nation. Those paradise moments \u2013 the very surprising 2008 Obama election, the crowds, the alliances, the decency, charm and intelligence of it all \u2013 exist alongside all that we now endure. It\u2019s a world that only a 24-hour news cycle could love. What will Trump do or say next? Like everything Trump touches, it\u2019s all about him. But I digress.</p> <p>Desperation and chaos are distracting. How dark will it get? Regardless, Obama is not going away.&#xa0;The America that elected him twice is not going away either. Like Elvis, that America has left the building. Hopefully it will reappear on election day.</p>",

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.spbt.ru/\">St Petersburg Ballet Theatre</a> was founded in 1994 by Konstantin Tachkin, a former soldier turned impresario. In 1998 a promising young graduate named Irina Kolesnikova joined the company, and 18 years later she is its uncontested star. SPBT\u2019s repertoire is built around Kolesnikova; the publicity for its new production, <em>Her Name Was Carmen</em>, describes her as \u201cthe world\u2019s leading ballerina\u201d (a claim unblushingly repeated on <a href=\"http://irinakolesnikova.com/main/?lang=eng\">Kolesnikova\u2019s own website</a>), and the programme contains page after page of photographs of her.</p> <p>The production relocates the Carmen story to a present-day refugee camp. With Oxfam\u2019s help, Kolesnikova visited camps in the Balkans, and was moved by the plight of the people she met there. But scrappy storytelling by librettist Roman Smirnov and woefully amateurish choreography by Olga Kostel result in a work that is creakily sentimental, expressive neither of the suffering of displaced peoples, nor of the drama of <em>Carmen</em>. The plot centres on the efforts of Carmen (Kolesnikova), a Spaniard of Syrian descent, to escape the violent and lustful attentions of people-smuggler Garcia (Yuri Kovalev), while indulging the love of Jos\u00e9 (Dmitry Akulinin), a policeman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e0e842d7c9a08678051d248f186c17b44b6610a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e0e842d7c9a08678051d248f186c17b44b6610a/489_0_2511_2686/935.jpg\" alt=\"Irina Kolesnikova (Carmen) and Yuri Kovalev (Garcia) in Her Name Was Carmen.\" width=\"935\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Irina Kolesnikova (Carmen) and Yuri Kovalev (Garcia) in Her Name Was Carmen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marilyn Kingwill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The SPBT dancers are well-trained, and many are impressive. Akulinin has style and panache to spare, Kovalev is brawny and unambiguously villainous; both project old-school Russian-balletic virility. Kolesnikova herself is tall and lissom, with an appealing stage presence and confident technique. But all three are constrained by choreography that veers between the vacant and the contrived. Kolesnikova\u2019s Carmen is either posturing emptily \u2013 much reaching-out of clasped hands \u2013 or being awkwardly manoeuvred by her partners. Nothing flows, and Murat Kabardokov\u2019s reworking of Bizet\u2019s long-suffering score contains some decidedly unusual modulations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This production is trying to have it both ways, reducing the objects of its compassion to an Aladdinesque human backdrop</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Given that this is a work reflective of real-life political tragedy, the costumes by Vladimir Firer are stunningly inappropriate. This is a pointe-shoe ballet, and no one is demanding strict <em>verismo</em>, but to dress 21st-century refugees as if they were exotics from a 19th-century orientalist fantasy like <em>Le Corsaire</em> is beyond the pale. We have all seen the news footage and the photographs, and the fierce determination with which Syrian women and girls, under the most hostile circumstances imaginable, maintain traditional standards of modesty. Kolesnikova has met the refugees, noted the headscarves and the dusty robes, the pitifully inadequate windcheaters and ragged sportswear.</p> <p>So why are these stage refugees dressed in a rainbow palette of wraparound pyjamas and sexy, form-fitting tops? Why the women\u2019s plunging necklines, bare limbs and uncovered heads? And why is Carmen, here supposedly a Syrian, dressed in a barely-there red chiffon minidress, like no Muslim refugee ever? This production is trying to have it both ways, to project a compassionate and contemporary social conscience while reducing the supposed objects of that compassion to a colourful, Aladdinesque human backdrop.</p> <p>There\u2019s no reason to suppose that Kolesnikova is anything but honest when she says that she has \u201clonged to do something to help\u201d, and that this production is an \u201canthem of love\u201d. Her sincerity shines through the paltry choreography. But it doesn\u2019t save the show.</p>",

Music was very accessible for me. It was something that I picked up super-quick.\u201d</p> <p>He tried to resist it for a while. In his early teens, he \u201cstopped regarding music as such an adamant passion \u2013 skateboarding took over\u201d. But music soon reinstated itself, and at 15 he decided to throw all his energies into pursuing it as a career.</p> <p>Since then, Collins, who grew up in the city of Evanston, north of Chicago, has been honing his skills as a rapper and producer \u2013 and his debut album, Nat Love, which came out last April, suggests he made the right move. A confident, engaging record, it tips a cap to the local hip-hop scene but draws inspiration from all over \u2013 Tame Impala and Black Sabbath were influences as well as Kanye West and Chance the Rapper. Collins produced most of the album himself, and its <strong>hazy, </strong>soulful sound complements his delivery, which can shift from laidback introspection to complex wordplay in a beat.</p> <p>The title refers to a black folk hero from the old west; one track, Death of a Salesman, nods to both Arthur Miller and Edgar Allan Poe. Was Collins an attentive student? \u201cNo, I was really bad,\u201d he says, wincing. His mind was elsewhere. \u201cI can make all my music in my bedroom. Which is nice, but it\u2019s also really distracting and it took its toll [on school work]. Graduating was definitely a relief.\u201d</p> <p>Collins still lives at home in Evanston and seems perfectly happy there, but he\u2019ll probably move to Chicago soon to be closer to his record label (he signed to Closed Sessions in March 2015, just before graduating). New tracks are forthcoming and he\u2019ll be touring later in the year and might even make it to Europe for the first time.</p> <p>Does he feel, at 19, that he has enough life experience to feed his music?</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d he replies. \u201cThat being said, I still have a lot of living to do. What you\u2019re hearing now is just the tip of the iceberg. I\u2019ve no idea what\u2019s coming next, but I\u2019m really excited to find out.\u201d<strong> Killian Fox</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Key track: </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl6OW07A5q4\"><strong><em>Stupid Rose</em></strong></a></p> <h2>WondaGurl</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c2accfbc2a6799462c437ed858d765ae9069ad8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c2accfbc2a6799462c437ed858d765ae9069ad8/0_161_3280_1967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ebony Oshurinde (AKA WondaGurl)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Hip-hop is as male today as it\u2019s been since the Wu-Tang sausagefest arrived in \u201893.

Born in Ripon, North Yorkshire, Marten was eight when her mother suggested she record some songs so they could send them to her grandparents in France via YouTube.</p> <p>Four years and numerous grandparents-only videos later, Marten was asked by popular YouTube channel <a href=\"http://www.ontsofa.com\">Ont\u2019 Sofa</a> to perform a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCkNyg2zgz0\">cover</a> of Lucy Rose\u2019s Middle of the Bed, which resulted in nearly half a million views. It was around this time that her mother asked if she\u2019d like to do music full-time. \u201cAt that point I realised I couldn\u2019t really do anything else,\u201d she told <em>Teen Vogue</em>. With her songwriting evolving at a startling pace, 2015\u2019s acclaimed EP, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeGJ23hXwuA\"><em>As Long As</em></a>, was written in-between studying for her GCSEs.</p> <p>Inspired by the lyrical dexterity of Nick Drake, Laura Marling and Loudon Wainwright, Marten\u2019s songs have delicacy and warmth. An air of melancholia underlies her bewitching vocal, and her guitar-playing is often augmented by distant strings or pitter-patter drums.

This is just what you get when you put the four of us in a room without any expectations.\u201d</p> <p>At the age of 12, guitarist Vilhelm Strange was in a punk band called Psykisk H\u00e5rdt.

It\u2019s important that you can hear the emotion.\u201d</p> <p>Liss rose swiftly: Holm started playing with drummer Tobias Laust in school, bonding over graffiti, Portishead and Massive Attack. One day they met Strange and bassist Villads Tyrrestrup in a rehearsal space and decided to merge bands.</p> <p>Jittery funk single Try was the first song they wrote together, and an instant online hit. XL Recordings signed them the day of their first London gig, and as a perk, took them to see Adele. (\u201cSo much to learn from her,\u201d says Holm.) Despite their inauspicious DIY beginnings, Liss are already breaching Adele\u2019s world, breaking into mainstream Danish radio. They definitely have common DNA with The 1975, and Sorry, the flickering vocoder-laden lead track from their debut XL release First, shares its name with Justin Bieber\u2019s massive 2015 hit.

Maybe it\u2019s because his story recalls two other Scottish pioneers of woozy, hip-hop-inflected electronica, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/14/hudson-mohawke-kanye-west-producer\">Hudson Mohawke</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/15/rustie-even-if-dont-believe-review-third-album\">Rustie</a>, who cut their teeth on the Glasgow scene as teenagers and started putting out music on Warp Records half a decade ago.</p> <p>Gellaitry hails from Stirling and has signed to XL, not Warp, but his sound owes a debt to his neighbours. Listen to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af-BdT-Y4B8\">Temple</a> from his February 2015 EP <em>Short Stories</em>, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_m2besVZeU\">Long Distance</a> on the <em>Escapism</em> EP, which followed last November, and you\u2019ll hear menacing horns, a la Hudson Mohawke, and complex, skittering beats and weird effects that wouldn\u2019t seem out of place on a Rustie record. Yet Gellaitry is no mere imitator. He has deft control over his material, which can be intricate, with an exuberant globetrotting aesthetic, but rarely feels cluttered. His <em>Escapism</em> EP contains middle-eastern strings, pitch-shifted dancehall vocals, snake-charmer woodwind, harps and EDM drops. You\u2019d expect these to clash horribly on a 17-minute EP, but somehow they make complete sense. Gellaitry\u2019s new EP, <a href=\"http://hypetrak.com/2016/08/sam-gellaitry-escapism-ii-ep-stream/\"><em>Escapism 2</em></a>, was released last month. <strong>KF</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Key track: </em></strong><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/samgellaitry/the-gateway\"><strong><em>The Gateway</em></strong></a></p> <h2>Harsh Crowd</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93051e828e5deb1e98921ab628611e69a1a48f4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93051e828e5deb1e98921ab628611e69a1a48f4e/0_72_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harsh Crowd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Teenagers hate stupid questions, and New York punks <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HarshCrowd/\">Harsh Crowd</a> have experienced plenty.

On their debut album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/16/lets-eat-grandma-i-gemini-review\"><em>I, Gemini</em></a>, they\u2019re playing recorders and ukuleles one moment, sounding like witchy sisters captured on an obscure early 70s psych-folk album; the next, they\u2019re messing with dubby electronics, and doing raps about bubblegum on their trainers.</p> <p>Hollingworth and Walton\u2019s hometown of Norwich has helped their uniqueness, they say, because it\u2019s \u201cquite isolated \u2026with a reputation for inbreeding\u201d. (They mentioned other local inspirations in another recent interview: \u201cUSA Nail Parlour: where we get our claws sharpened\u201d.) They met at four, and have been inseparable since, writing songs in Hollingworth\u2019s attic (\u201cbecause it\u2019s quiet\u201d) and rehearsing in her bathroom. Unlike many other young talents, there are no musicians in their families; both talk enthusiastically about how writing songs gives them power. \u201cThey can change things in the world, and help you express yourself when you don\u2019t know what to say\u2026\u201d \u201cAnd they\u2019re all about our friendship, too, of course,\u201d says the other.

One Soundcloud upload got them a record deal, and a first gig followed last year.</p> <p>The best rock can be divided into two categories: songs of attraction or repulsion. Some of the greatest songs encompass both opposing emotions. What\u2019s most important is feeling something, anything, and Pretty Vicious understand this visceral hunger for sensation better than any band of their generation. The music they\u2019ve released so far is reminiscent of Arctic Monkeys\u2019 teenage reportage, lacking their arched-eyebrow lyrical voyeurism, but unleashing a grungy fury that\u2019s breathtaking to behold. Brash lead riffs buzzsaw around twitchy guitar rhythms, the subterranean basslines are more menacing than a pool of fresh blood at a bus stop, and apocalyptic drums summon thunder to Griffith\u2019s curled-lip cawing.</p> <p>Some may gripe that the music is as subtle as a lobotomist\u2019s drill; it\u2019ll be interesting to see if they want, or are able, to get deeper on their upcoming debut album. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6uBrek6Kd4\">Cave Song</a>, their most recent single, is 140 seconds about drinking in a cave.

Later they entered talent shows around Atlanta, before someone suggested they put their covers on YouTube. They posted Pretty Hurts and watched in shock as it went viral. They also started writing their own songs, learning to play instruments via YouTube tutorials. Once signed to Parkwood, the pair worked on the EP in their home studio. \u201cTrying to find our sound was a process of us just writing songs every day and really digging in to see what would come out,\u201d Halle remembers. \u201cWe tried everything.

  "<p>He was \u201ca modest little man, with plenty to be modest about\u201d. So said Winston Churchill of the politician who was at his side throughout the war and then crushed him at the ballot box immediately afterwards.</p> <p>Clement Attlee is, as John Bew explains in his exemplary biography, Labour\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labour.labourconference\" title=\"\">unlikeliest of heroes</a>. He was remarkably unremarkable. He hailed from the suburbs and returned to the suburbs; the young man from the minor public school was, like John Major, obsessive about cricket. His most memorable moment as a schoolboy was Queen Victoria\u2019s diamond jubilee, one of the great celebrations of empire. As he wrote towards the end of his life in 1960: \u201cMost of us boys at that time were imperialists with an immense pride in the achievements of our race.\u201d</p> <p>So how did a man who was the object of so much private derision by his peers come to preside over Labour\u2019s greatest (some might say only) radical government? Bew puts the question at the core of his story. He answers it convincingly by mixing arresting narrative with a thorough study of the people and policies of the Labour movement at a time of hardship interspersed by war and fierce ideological difference.</p> <p>Attlee was elected mayor of Stepney in 1919, a year to the day after the Armistice, having begun his intellectual inquiry into the problem of poverty in the East End working for the Haileybury Boys Club. He was the unthreatening figure who could get the job done. Throughout his career he was surrounded by larger personalities. His trick was to appear as the family solicitor \u201cadvising the old lady very sagely on her investments\u201d. Was this most unspun of political leaders really that guileless, or was it part of the game plan to rise without trace?</p> <p>It was Ramsay MacDonald, the great betrayer of the Labour party, who gave Attlee his big break. Oswald Mosley had resigned from the cabinet. MacDonald looked around him and chose \u201cthe most uninteresting, unimaginative but most reliable among his backbenchers to replace the fallen angel\u201d.</p> <p>MacDonald\u2019s decision to form a national government resulted in the closest thing modern Britain has produced to a one-party state. In the election that followed, Labour ended up with only 46 MPs. One of the few left was Attlee, who in 1935 took over as leader. The <em>Daily Mail</em> struggled to do a proper hatchet job on him, resorting to observing that he had a similar-shaped head to that of Lenin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"314c0826b4b3914cf256fe6054740ae8d5ed538b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/314c0826b4b3914cf256fe6054740ae8d5ed538b/0_1110_3375_2024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clement Attlee in the garden of 10 Downing Street, London, in August 1945\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clement Attlee in the garden of 10 Downing Street, London, in August 1945.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When war came, Attlee threw in his lot with Churchill. While the prime minister focused on the military effort, his deputy made sure the country still functioned on the domestic front. Introducing the <a href=\"http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1940/may/22/emergency-powers-defence-bill\" title=\"\">emergency powers defence bill</a>, Attlee told the nation the government was assuming full control over all persons and property. Britain suddenly entered an era of state planning. William Beveridge\u2019s drily entitled report, <a href=\"http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/public-health-and-wellbeing/beveridge-report/\" title=\"\">Social Insurance and Allied Services</a>, may have been radical in content, but it was in keeping with the time. Bew includes the intriguing observation that a copy of the report was found in Hitler\u2019s bunker.</p> <p>For an exhausted electorate, Attlee\u2019s modesty at the 1945 election was a welcome contrast to Churchill\u2019s bombast. The six years of that government were remarkable not just for the huge social agenda \u2013 the formation of the NHS and welfare state \u2013 but also for foreign policy challenges that put the present Brexit fiasco into perspective. On any given day Attlee was dealing with demobilisation, the withdrawal of the US-provided <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease\" title=\"\">Lend-Lease</a> financing that almost bankrupted&#xa0;the UK, the withdrawal from India and Palestine, the increasing&#xa0;threat of Soviet Russia and the nuclear bomb.</p> <p>As the <em>Manchester Guardian</em> wrote: \u201cWe walk in the shadow of economic catastrophe and live month to month.\u201d Attlee exhorted the people to work harder, to keep those belts tightened. One of the many huge billboards around the country declared: \u201cAn all-out effort will increase our production by the 10% we need to turn the tide.\u201d This was 1948, the year George Orwell completed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/10/1984-george-orwell\" title=\"\"><em>1984</em></a>.</p> <p>And yet this was a government led by a man who shunned publicity, who enjoyed tending the garden and whose wife, Violet, would drive him around, frequently crashing the car. (Clem, she reported, was \u201calways an absolute dear\u201d about these scrapes.) The book is replete with amusing vignettes. In February 1933, Nye Bevan was due to debate Mosley at the Cambridge Union, but had to pull out at the last minute with the flu. Attlee volunteered to do it. He rushed off with Frank Owen, a former MP turned <em>Daily Express </em>journalist, braving ice-covered roads in their hats, scarves and goggles in Owen\u2019s open-top car. \u201cIn the course of the three-hour drive they twice came off the road and hit a ditch,\u201d writes Bew. The author also recounts how, when Bevan first outlined his vision for a national health service in October 1945, Attlee expressed delight that his minister had done well \u201con a pretty sticky wicket\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4c17efeebe474a22d02a1ae0e7ce5126aca794a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4c17efeebe474a22d02a1ae0e7ce5126aca794a/0_725_4878_2926/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clement Attlee addresses a political rally in July 1938\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clement Attlee addresses a political rally in July 1938.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Herald Archive/SSPL via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How best to categorise Attlee? Bew describes him as a social patriot. His was a very British New Deal, a new contract between state and citizen. He was no revolutionary; he did not see it as his mission to purge the establishment. \u201cIt was not that their privileges were taken away; what was taken away was the ethos of hierarchy that made sense of those privileges,\u201d writes Bew.</p> <p>This book will become required reading for the present-day Labour party as it tears itself apart in a desperate attempt to redefine a credible socialism for the 21st century. Attlee has long since become lionised across the left and beyond. The contrast could not have been greater in his lifetime.</p> <p>Another sneering one-liner doing the rounds was: an empty taxi drove up to No 10 and Clement Attlee got out. It was attributed to Churchill, but in this case it wasn\u2019t him. It spoke for many, however.</p> <p><em>Citizen Clem is published by Quercus (\u00a330). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/citizen-clem.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a324</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Some debates are marked toxic from the start. Try the existence of our old chums fairness and balance in reporting Jeremy Corbyn, for instance. The <em>Times</em> clears its front page to announce that Jeremy\u2019s \u201con course to win a bigger mandate\u201d than he did first time round, according to YouGov. Perhaps that means the media campaign, real or perceived, against him isn\u2019t working: or perhaps it shows the BBC and other supposed culprits aren\u2019t hopelessly biased after all.</p> <p>But stir in 170 or so dissident MPs and some equally decisive opinion polls pointing in a precisely different direction \u2013 down and out \u2013 and objective truth sinks into the mists, leaving only one vital difference behind.</p> <p>Fairness and balance can be media mantras at general election time, or whenever they directly affect national decision-making. It\u2019s not so certain, though, that they apply as tightly to the choices that are made within the closed circuit of internal political-party voting.

Isn\u2019t that fair and balanced enough to keep the BBC Trust in chocolate biscuits?</p> <p>But consider \u2026 As a prescient Frank Field MP told the <em>Times</em>: \u201cWho gets elected leader of the Labour party obviously matters in determining its future. But the centre of gravity is shifting. Already Labour\u2019s future may depend less on who wins the contest between Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith than who is elected Ukip\u2019s leader.\u201d</p> <p>Ukip scored 3,881,099 votes in the 2015 general election. More than the Lib Dems and SNP put together. Its current poll rating, even leaderless in the lee of Theresa, mostly hovers in the 14% region. Last June, at Brexit time, it was five or six points higher than that. Without Ukip, Remain would have won. Editorialists talked obsessively, post-referendum, about the disaffected white legions of the north and Midlands in revolt against London\u2019s elite. Yet where is that newfound extra-metropolitan fascination when Ukip makes its own top choices?</p> <p>The answer, of course, is that it\u2019s convenient to forget. Only the <em>Daily Express</em> \u2013 mindful of Richard Desmond\u2019s party donations \u2013 has made any consistent effort. The <em>Telegraph</em> and the <em>Mail</em>, like the<em> Mirror</em>, seem happy to push the competing quintet to the periphery. Of course there\u2019s some coverage: the <em>Guardian</em>, like the <em>Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/30/ukip-leadership-race-exposes-ideological-faultlines-in-party-that-has-achieved-its-goal\" title=\"\">keeps an eye on things from time to time</a>. But Frank Field\u2019s centre of gravity hasn\u2019t exactly shifted yet. No one bar the <em>Express</em> seems to acknowledge it has Ukip readers on board.</p> <p>Who cares? Labour supporters and mainstream Tories don\u2019t want nonentities to become entities by bringing them in from the periphery. BBC interviewers obviously fret when immigration interviews lurch out of control. Five is an unwieldy studio number. You can understand, and possibly applaud, all of this. Pragmatic convenience. But is it fair? Is it balanced? Do such things \u2013 issues of supposed principle \u2013 matter if \u2026 well, if it\u2019s just Ukip?</p>",
  "<p>The leader of the Lib Dems, Tim Farron, struck a chord last week when he said that as a result of the Brexit vote, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/brexit-vote-nigel-farage-making-uk-laughing-stock-abroad-tim-farron\" title=\"\">Britain had become a laughing stock abroad</a>.</p> <p>He is quite right. I myself have been receiving baffled inquiries from friends overseas. And on two recent trips to get away from it all \u2013 to Crete and Provence, since you ask \u2013 we could not escape. Everyone we encountered \u2013 yes, everyone \u2013 asked why this country had taken leave of its senses.</p> <p>It is no good people saying we Remainers, or \u201cBrits-in\u201d as an acquaintance terms us, should shut up, accept that \u201cthe people have spoken\u201d and get on with it. This is the biggest crisis to erupt in my working life, and the implications are far too daunting to be taken lying down.</p> <p>Meanwhile, it is evident from its behaviour so far that the government is all over the place. But one thing is crystal clear: by making immigration the priority over membership of the single market, Theresa May is almost guaranteeing that, in order to offer sops to the Cerberus of burgeoning racism in this country, the economy will suffer.</p> <p>In the past 43 years of membership of the European Union for which successive prime ministers fought so hard, we have become an integral part of the European economy. In addition, until this summer, we enjoyed, in George Soros\u2019s words, \u201cthe best of both worlds\u201d \u2013 being beneficiaries of our trading relations with the rest of the EU, while outside the eurozone and the Schengen arrangement.</p> <p>While I have always been strongly European, I agreed with the many economists who argued that the eurozone was badly constructed, placing noble political aims over economic reality. The American economist and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, who is by no means anti-European, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/10/joseph-stiglitz-the-problem-with-europe-is-the-euro\" title=\"\">has delivered a powerful critique</a> of the way the eurozone has produced lower growth than potential, and unnecessary and potentially dangerous levels of unemployment in nations that, frankly, were not qualified to join a fixed exchange rate system in which the principal beneficiary was Germany.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the decision not to sign up to the euro \u2013 a masterstroke on the part of Gordon Brown and Ed Balls \u2013 did not diminish the advantages of being in the single market. Big business, and many small businesses, operate at a European level, with supply chains all over the continent. They are accustomed to the existing laws and regulations. Moreover, our membership of the EU is the principal attraction for all that inward investment that governments of both major parties have successfully attracted over the decades.</p> <p>All this is being put at risk, as a result of craven acceptance of an \u201cadvisory\u201d referendum whose result was almost certainly determined by the false prospectus offered by the Brexiters.</p> <p>Even those in the Leave camp who complained that our sovereignty had been sacrificed to Brussels must wonder about a prime minister who last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/27/theresa-may-acting-like-tudor-monarch-in-denying-mps-a-vote-over-brexit\" title=\"\">brushed aside the sovereignty of our parliament</a> when it comes to initiating negotiations with the rest of Europe. The following day, the health secretary reminded her and the rest of us that in this country \u201cwe don\u2019t have government by plebiscite\u201d.</p> <p>I meet many people who express the hope that May is playing a clever game. Knowing the incompatibility of the Brexiters\u2019 demands on immigration and continuing membership of the single market, and the years it would take to negotiate trade deals through the World Trade Organisation (WTO), they hope that the Brexiters will soon drive into a cul-de-sac, and normal service will be resumed. Of course, if the hit to the economy is as bad as one fears, we may find that net immigration from the EU reduces spontaneously as unemployed workers return home.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there is a vociferous element in the (mainly) rightwing, Eurosceptic press saying \u201cLook! The economy is fine. Brexit effect? What Brexit effect?\u201d</p> <p>Yes, consumers may have been on a spending spree during a remarkable summer, and London has been awash with tourists on shopping sprees, attracted by the cheap pound. Employment is still relatively high. But there are time lags in these matters. As Llewellyn Consulting has pointed out, investment plans are being cut back and the prospects for future growth are already deteriorating.</p> <p>Now, most commentators are agreed that the Bank of England, in common with other central banks, is running out of monetary ammunition, and fiscal policy \u2013 the use of government spending and tax cuts \u2013 should be brought in from the ideological cold.</p> <p>Indeed, on the eve of the G20 conference in China, US treasury secretary Jack Lew sounded an optimistic note about a resurgence of fiscal policy around the world. He even cited the UK.</p> <p>The UK? I hope so, but I wonder. A lot of hope has been placed on our new chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s references to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36864099\" title=\"\">need to \u201creset\u201d fiscal policy</a>. But there is a danger: remember the oracle at Delphi, whose ambiguous words could be open to dangerous misinterpretation? Noises emanating from the Treasury and the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggest there is already panic in the ranks about a prospective deterioration in the budgetary position as a result of the likely impact on tax revenues of Brexit. Might there be a reset in the wrong direction?</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hantverk &amp; Found, 18 King Street, Margate CT9 1DA (01843 280 454). Meal for two including drinks and service: \u00a360-\u00a380</strong></p> <p>A bright Sunday morning in late summer and along King Street in Margate the pavements are stacked with tattered fragments of my late parents\u2019 lives. There are old suitcases, and the kind of wooden chairs I would have sat upon in a doctor\u2019s waiting room when I was six and had earache. There are transfer-printed tea sets, and walnut sideboards with sliding glass doors that make me shudder.</p> <p>They remind me of overheated afternoons in my grandmother\u2019s council flat in Paddington, heavy with wordless recrimination and the tang of overstewed tea. The older generation are meant to be adored simply for having not died, but my grandmother was a nasty piece of work, manipulative and bitter. Here, now, is what could be the contents of her living room, repurposed, depending on your point of view, as retro furnishing, vintage, kitsch or just plain overpriced junk.</p> <p>Excuse the jaundiced eye. Yes, there are objects in the cluttered junk shops along King Street that trouble me. But I also see glories from its kiss-me-quick seaside past: old neon lights and various bits of fairground gilding; pinball tables, beaten-out enamelled metal signage and faux ships\u2019 figureheads in garish colours which turn out to be not chipped plaster, but aged polystyrene. In the process of moving forward to the new, the old Margate is being sold off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a54b012058de411ab1bdd3e15714963908b6b89e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a54b012058de411ab1bdd3e15714963908b6b89e/733_302_2486_2486/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Salt Hake croquettes with half a lemon on a white plate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Little dishies: salt Hake croquettes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I last reviewed here in 2005 when an unknown chef had put his name above the door of his ambitious restaurant and instituted a \u201cno jeans\u201d policy. The <a href=\"https://www.turnercontemporary.org/\">Turner Contemporary</a>, a major art gallery, had announced it would be opening here, and the chef had attempted to get in early on the opportunity. But the Turner didn\u2019t open until 2011, by which time he had long gone. Now, though, the opportunity, like the money, has properly arrived. Buildings are being bought up by people priced out of London who want to furnish their renovated Georgian villas with those garish offcuts from the crumbling promenade, for reasons of irony or bad taste, or both.</p> <p>It was inevitable. Hardcore naysayers will sneer at gentrification of this sort. They will argue that the impact is patchy and, of course, they\u2019re right; go three streets back from the front and the old, crumbling Margate with its endemic problems of social exclusion is still there. (The marvellous jazz singer, <a href=\"http://www.lianecarroll.co.uk/\">Liane Carroll</a>, describes her forever up-and-coming home town of Hastings as still being \u201ca big drug town with a small fishing problem\u201d.) But good things come with gentrification, too, including a literary festival: the brilliantly named <a href=\"http://margatebookie.com/\">Margate Bookie</a>, now in its second year, with a distinct community focus. This year it gave away 700 children\u2019s books. If gentrification means books being given to kids who wouldn\u2019t otherwise get them, only the professionally angry could sneer.</p> <p>It also means the arrival of places such as Hantverk &amp; Found, a tiny cupboard of a fish restaurant, half tiled in the sea green of a Victorian public convenience. Here, you are encouraged to sit elbow to elbow, or nose to armpit. There are 10 seats up front, plus a few in the garden, and a couple of people in the kitchen knocking out idiosyncratic fish dishes, most of which hit the mark. Hantverk is Swedish for homemade. \u201cFound\u201d, I\u2019m told, references the taking of fish from the waters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24aa68f4cf128abbc2144e080f6e8ae47c6e4636\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24aa68f4cf128abbc2144e080f6e8ae47c6e4636/0_400_4247_2549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A plate of queenie scallops\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Worth shelling out for: queenie scallops, \u00a38.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a literal title, and also does a good job of framing the place and its quiet ambition. Yes, you can have rock oysters plainly served. But they also come dressed, with the crunch and kick of jalape\u00f1o and pickled cucumber, or with yuzu and wakame, which makes them taste even more of themselves. Plates of local crab, dressed and piled on a scallop shell, pass us by, as does the red and silver of tomatoes heaped with torn basil leaves and boquerones, looking like a pen-and-wash illustration from a cook book. That kitchen cares how these dishes look.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d518d7729b41ba36227cdbef244089b2920200b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d518d7729b41ba36227cdbef244089b2920200b4/555_120_3375_3374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A multi-coloured plate of oysters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rock oysters: \u2018dressed with yuzu and yakame, they taste even more of themselves\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We have a generous serving of queenie scallops for \u00a38, deep fried in a pleasingly golden panko crumb and served with a salty-sweet bowl of soy, eased by a good splash of mirin. That dipping sauce comes in handy with the dish of the meal, a salad of cool, slippery black rice noodles, piled with crab and chilli. If there is a general fault here, it is a light hand on the seasoning. A dribble of the dipping sauce poured across the noodles makes the whole plateful sing.<br></p> <p>Croquettes of house-salted hake are warm balls of flaky fish that crumble apart obligingly, ready for a dredge through the saffron mayonnaise that stays the right side of soapy. The more complex dishes stumble slightly. Borlotti beans in a tomato broth with glistening puddles of basil oil is all the flavours you want on a summer\u2019s day, and the giant clams lend a deep burst of surf and iodine and beach breeze to the liquor. But there\u2019s no point pretending. The meat in those clams bounces and springs like a ball of postmen\u2019s elastic bands. They slip down my gullet with all the grace of a teenager going off to tidy their room. The flavours in a stew of braised squid with the kick of harissa demand the bread it comes with. The squid itself should have stayed in there a little longer to soften up. The deep-fried knot of tentacles on the top is better.</p> <p>But I forgive Hantverk &amp; Found these small errors, mostly for the sunny, good natured take-us-as-you-find-us feel of the place. The meringue with raspberries and a dollop of thick whipped cream flavoured with rose water is not an exemplar of the art; it\u2019s too crisp and solid all the way to the core. But it\u2019s a surprisingly well-balanced dessert and when all three elements are taken together, the rose becomes a fragrance, rather than the nightmarish smell of my grandmother\u2019s dressing table. Far better are long-roasted apricots used as the base for a crumble topping, alongside a scoop of strident cinnamon ice cream. It is one of those brilliantly nickable ideas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfe75148c4fcd04447b8ead804eac4bfaf887d03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfe75148c4fcd04447b8ead804eac4bfaf887d03/0_457_4438_2663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dish of the meal: black noodle salad with crab.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dish of the meal: black noodle salad with crab.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is also a reminder that autumn is not far away; that soon cold winds will blow once again along the Margate front.

The woman taps her husband on the shoulder and holds up a copy of Andrew Bolt\u2019s new book, Worth Fighting For.</p> <p>\u201cDarl, why don\u2019t we get this for your dad?\u201d she asks teasingly, a grin on her face.</p> <p>Her husband, dressed impeccably in a tweed suit jacket and trilby hat, visibly recoils at the suggestion, looking her up and down as though a spell has suddenly fallen from his eyes and he\u2019s discovered he\u2019s been tricked into marrying a snake.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, Janet, no! What are you thinking?\u201d</p> <p>Needless to say, the festival is not Bolt\u2019s usual crowd. The yearly talkfest has a reputation for attracting well-moneyed progressives of the pre-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull variety, which made Bolt\u2019s appearance as the guest of choice for the regular \u201cHow Many Dangerous Ideas Can One Person Have?\u201d fixture something of an odd fit.</p> <p>Bolt and the festival hardly have the most cordial of histories. In 2014, he railed against <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/blogs/andrew-bolt/honor-killing-speech-cancelled-critics-blamed/news-story/0db8d6142c7c687e88d78bdeae294ea1\">the programmed appearance</a> of writer Uthman Badar, who was to speak on the ethics of \u201chonour killings\u201d, and contributed to the event\u2019s swift cancellation. Two years later, the announcement that Bolt himself was being given a prime spot on the lineup likewise prompted outrage, with the Indigenous actor <a href=\"https://www.pedestrian.tv/news/arts-and-culture/nakkiah-lui-leads-charge-of-people-wanting-andrew-/34e14d21-778a-4e79-9eaf-16e402282b92.htm\">Nakkiah Lui leading a petition</a> to have him dropped from the event on the grounds that giving him a platform amounted to \u201clegitimising his hate speech and closing your doors to those he vilifies\u201d.</p> <p>The Opera House, which said little throughout the kerfuffle, defended the decision to invite Bolt: \u201cThe FODI session is a rare opportunity to interrogate the views and ideas that Mr Bolt will present\u201d. </p> <p>Such an opportunity doesn\u2019t come often. While he hardly needs additional platforms from which to sell himself, Bolt exercises strict control over almost every iteration of his public profile. His columns go to print in newspapers that share his ideological leanings. The guests on his TV show, The Bolt Report, are usually either his fellow travellers or someone he wants to give a talking to.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/03/some-blunt-truths-and-a-ray-of-hope-for-the-refugee-justice-movement\">Some blunt truths and a ray of hope for the refugee justice movement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So there was a genuine reason for someone not of Bolt\u2019s political persuasion to go along: how would this very prolific, powerful influence on our political landscape do in an arena not of his choosing? Against a live, unpredictable and probably hostile audience willing to challenge him? </p> <p>The answer, unfortunately, was not forthcoming; the long-awaited Great Clash of Ideas in the hopefully named Drama Theatre never materialised. What transpired instead was an hour-long fizzer: half puff-piece interview, half talking points regurgitation. </p> <p>Besides his standard denunciations of the ABC, the Racial Discrimination Act, climate change \u201cwarmism\u201d \u2013 \u201cIn what other field of human endeavour do you hear \u2018the science is settled\u2019? What kind of moron says that?\u201d \u2013 Bolt happily used the furore around his appearance to play the martyr card when it suited. \u201cThe security you\u2019ve had to arrange for this event, it\u2019s not to save you!\u201d he joked to the audience early on, putting forward an argument that his dangerous ideas place himself in more danger than anybody else.</p> <p>FODI cofounder Simon Longstaff, who MCed the event and interviewed Bolt for close to an hour, was less of a foil than he was a wet napkin. Strange gaps in Bolt\u2019s free speech-at-all-costs mantra went unchallenged \u2013 like when he wondered out loud why \u201cpeople can protest wherever they like\u201d and why protesters feel the need to \u201ccreate a great nuisance to other people\u201d. (Presumably Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza, who headlined her own event two hours later, would have a thing or two to say about that.) </p> <p>Nor did Bolt\u2019s own campaign to remove Badar from the lineup in 2014 come up. At the end, Longstaff thanked the crowd for facilitating \u201ca celebration of reason, rather than righteous indignation\u201d, adding that he \u201ccan\u2019t stand the yelling that goes on\u201d.</p> <p>The hour might have benefited from a bit of yelling, if only to liven things up a bit. The fifteen minutes for questions at the end didn\u2019t bring the robust debate and interrogation the Opera House hoped would justify Bolt\u2019s appearance, with proceedings quickly devolving into a weird, slightly unsettling love-in.</p> <p>\u201cThank you so much, you\u2019re brave, you\u2019re courageous, we love you,\u201d gushed one young questioner. Another, who began his question with the phrase \u201cas a libertarian\u201d, spent the next five minutes talking about what we can learn from the French Revolution. The single audience member who asked a mildly challenging question, inquiring if his position on human-induced climate change was softening given new evidence, was yelled at to \u201cget out\u201d by someone in the crowd and scoffed at by Bolt himself. </p> <p>For a festival that prides itself on being \u201cdangerous\u201d, arguably the biggest sin FODI committed in pencilling Bolt in was that of being boring. People who agree with Bolt showed up to cheer him on, people who don\u2019t went to watch race discrimination commissioner Tim Soutphommasane instead and security ensured no one too suspicious-looking did any event hijacking. After all that fuss, no one in the audience came away with anything different to what they carried in.</p>",
  "<p>I have been trying \u2013 so far, I confess, without success \u2013 to discover who minted the phrase \u201cpolitical honeymoon\u201d. It is a strange expression: marriage is rarely an appropriate metaphor for a country\u2019s relationship with its leader. It describes an odd quirk of electorates. The public tell pollsters that they are most enthusiastically in favour of a leader in his or her opening period in office, precisely the time when voters know least about the person who has just taken charge.</p> <p>Theresa May is benefiting from this irrational phenomenon and enjoying much higher approval ratings than those of David Cameron during his final chapter at Number 10. The British are often held to be a cynical bunch, but this country usually awards some sort of honeymoon to a new prime minister. John Major had one when he succeeded Margaret Thatcher and pulled off the clever trick of making the country think that they\u2019d got a new government as well as a new leader. Tony Blair had a long and even intense one after he won his first election in 1997. Hard though it may be to recall now, Labour didn\u2019t lose a seat at a byelection in his first six years at Number 10. At one point, his pollsters were telling him that Mr Blair had an approval rating of above 90%, the sort of numbers you would usually only expect for the leader of North Korea.</p> <p>Gordon Brown had such a hot romance with the electorate when he first moved into Number 10 that he was tempted to call a snap general election. Then he got cold feet and that was the end of his honeymoon. David Cameron had a relatively long period of grace with the electorate after 2010, partly because a lot of the flak for unpopular decisions in the early years of the coalition was deflected on to the Lib Dems.</p> <p>The honeymoon being enjoyed by Mrs May has some features specific to her personality and circumstances. Since she arrived at Number 10, she has combined the novelty of change with the reassurance of the familiar. She was a well-known, if not that well-understood, figure after a long stretch as home secretary. She looks the part as prime minister. After all the turbulence around the Brexit referendum and its aftermath, she has come across as a stabilising presence. At the same time, she is also something different, the first female prime minister in more than a quarter of a century and only the second woman at Number 10 in our history. The media, as is usually the case with a new prime minister, are being reasonably well-disposed towards her. In her honeymoon period, she can get a positive headline out of the admission that she doesn\u2019t like the shape of her nose. The Tory press like her, at least for now. They never really warmed to her predecessor; the rightwing tabloids hated Mr Cameron for the Leveson inquiry and they then went to war against him over Europe. The leftish media are still calibrating their gunsights or too preoccupied with the self-immolation of the Labour party to be concentrating on Mrs May.</p> <p>Defining yourself against your predecessor, even when they were of the same party, is one of the oldest tricks played by new prime ministers. John Major extracted a lot of mileage out of not being Margaret Thatcher. Gordon Brown did well for a short while by not being Tony Blair. Mrs May has scored some quick, easy hits by striking contrasts with Mr Cameron. She has \u2013 at least in words, we will see about the reality \u2013 junked the austerity agenda. She has talked some one-nation language about social reform. Many of her statements since she moved into Number 10 have been implicit, and sometimes explicit, rebukes of the Cameron government for being too posh, too privileged, too metropolitan and too obsessed with what she likes to disparage as \u201cpolitical games\u201d. Her people often refer to the Cameron cabinet as \u201cthe previous regime\u201d as if it was a government of a different party and conveniently forgetting that Mrs May sat in that cabinet for six years.</p> <p>Nick Clegg\u2019s forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/03/nick-clegg-did-not-cater-tories-brazen-ruthlessness\" title=\"\">memoir </a>is not friendly \u2013 he accuses her of misrepresenting immigration statistics \u2013 but the more wounding revelations are probably those at the expense of David Cameron and George Osborne. The former deputy prime minister gives an example of their games-playing when he reports that they weren\u2019t interested in building more social housing on the grounds that it \u201cjust creates Labour voters\u201d. Mrs May has also been helped because the vote to leave the European Union has not had the immediately traumatic economic consequences that some forecast. This doesn\u2019t tell us anything about the long-term impact, but it has been a short-term fillip for the government. The bounce on the stock market has been accompanied by a rally in the Tory party\u2019s poll rating, which currently hovers around the 40 point mark, an improvement on their vote share in the 2015 election. Then there is the competition \u2013 or lack of it. Having achieved what it existed to get, Ukip is trying to work out its continuing, post-Farage point. The Lib Dems struggle to get their voice heard. Labour is going through its own special kind of existential hell. No wonder some of Mrs May\u2019s senior colleagues are bewildered that she has ruled out an early election to capitalise on all these advantages while she still has them.</p> <p>For when parliament returns this week it will be a reminder that her structural position is weak. The Conservatives have a working majority of just 17, which is smaller than the number of people she sacked from the government when she culled the Camborne circle. If there was a common denominator to her purge, it was that the sacked were allies of the previous prime minister or friends of the former chancellor. The dispossessed may have lost their ministries, but they are still MPs. They will bide their time and nurture their wrath, waiting to unleash it when Mrs May starts to trip and fumble.</p> <p>She has so far defined herself more in words than deeds. Mrs May is a relatively blank canvas on which Tories of different persuasions can paint their hopes, their dreams and their fantasies. Trouble will start when she starts to put flesh on Mayism. We have had a couple of harbingers. One was the negative reaction to the decision to water down the government\u2019s anti-obesity strategy. Another was the recent revelation that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/01/lunch-with-theresa-may-thatll-will-be-3150\" title=\"\">\u00a33,150 will buy you into a \u201cbusiness day\u201d</a> at the Tory conference, Mrs May\u2019s presence included in the price of the ticket. People make the point, no less potent for being obvious, that offering companies the chance to purchase access to the prime minister sits badly with her rhetorical flourishes about being on the side of the many, not \u201cthe privileged few\u201d.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s travails are a mixed blessing for the Conservatives. A weak opposition encourages two dangerous traits of the Tory beast: arrogance and ill-discipline. When I recently suggested to one of Mrs May\u2019s cabinet that the implosion of the Labour party was not good news for the Tories over the longer term because it would foment their own divisions, he replied: \u201cI regret to say that I think you are completely accurate.\u201d</p> <p>Mrs May has a thing about discipline. As home secretary, she was not famous for being either a delegator or a sharer of information with colleagues. This style is clearly being imported into her Number 10. She has told civil servants that she wants a more formal style of decision-making. Unlike her predecessor, she will not make the first announcement of a parliamentary vote on a military intervention via Twitter. Number 10 has issued an edict around Whitehall that all media bids for interviews with ministers, and on whatever topic, however significant or inconsequential, must now be cleared through Downing Street.</p> <p>This will frustrate the broadcasters, who have all those hours of airtime to fill, and is already generating consternation, annoyance and resistance in departments. One minister, speaking to us without clearance from Number 10, describes this control order as \u201ccompletely ridiculous\u201d. Mrs May is not the first prime minister to try this and I suspect that, like others before her, she will discover that it is just not achievable for Number 10 to try to impose this level of domination. Some will put it down to control-freakery. Others will see it as an angry reaction to the cabinet leaks and spats about Brexit over August. A third explanation is nerves. Mrs May and the new team at Number 10 sit atop a government with a slender majority, a cabinet with some extremely combustible egos and a party with deep divisions that cannot be long disguised by the meaningless mantra of \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d.</p> <p>Mrs May has had just over 50 days in Number 10, during which she has done a deft job of obscuring her vulnerabilities by projecting herself as a fresh yet solid leader serenely stepping in to take charge. But she, more than anyone else, will understand how shaky is the ground beneath her feet, how uneasy lies the head that wears the crown. She\u2019s also been around long enough to know that the one certain thing about honeymoons is that they come to an end.</p>"
