  "<p>When I was a girl of 11 I had an argument with my father that left my psyche maimed. It was about whether a woman could be the president of the US.</p> <p>How did it even start? I was no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/feminism\">feminist</a> prodigy, just a shy kid who preferred reading to talking; politics weren\u2019t my destiny. Probably, I was trying to work out what was possible for my category of person \u2013 legally, logistically \u2013 as one might ask which kinds of terrain are navigable for a newly purchased bicycle. Up until then, gender hadn\u2019t darkened my mental doorway as I followed my older brother into our daily adventures wearing hand-me-down jeans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-criminal-james-comey\">James Comey: FBI has found no criminal wrongdoing in new Clinton emails</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in adolescence it dawned on me I\u2019d be spending my future as a woman, and when I looked around, alarm bells rang. My mother was a capable, intelligent, deeply unhappy woman who aspired to fulfilment as a housewife but clearly disliked the job. I saw most of my friends\u2019 mothers packed into that same dreary boat. My father was a country physician, admired and rewarded for work he loved. In my primordial search for a life coach, he was the natural choice.</p> <p>I probably started by asking him if girls could go to college, have jobs, be doctors, tentatively working my way up the ladder. His answers grew more equivocal until finally we faced off, Dad saying, \u201cNo\u201d and me saying, \u201cBut why not?\u201d A female president would be dangerous. His reasons vaguely referenced menstruation and emotional instability, innate female attraction to maternity and aversion to power, and a general implied ickyness that was beneath polite conversation.</p> <p>I ended that evening curled in bed with my fingernails digging into my palms and a silent howl tearing through me that lasted hours and left me numb. The next day I saw life at a remove, as if my skull had been jarred. What changed for me was not a dashing of specific hopes, but an understanding of what my father \u2013 the person whose respect I craved \u2013 really saw when he looked at me. I was tainted. I would grow up to be a lesser person, confined to an obliquely shameful life.</p> <p>But I didn\u2019t stop asking what a woman gets to do, and so began a lifelong confrontation with that internal howl. The slap-downs were often unexpected. Play drums in the band? No. Sign up for the science team? Go camping with the guys? Go jogging in shorts and a tank top without fear of being assaulted? Experiment boldly, have a career, command a moral authority of my own? Walk home safely after dark? No, no, no.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/06/why-do-we-love-a-trainwreck\">Why do successful women like Hillary Clinton get under so many people's skin?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eventually, I wrestled my way to yes on most of these things, except of course the last one. And the same dread that stalks me in dark parking lots \u2013 the helpless fury of knowing I don\u2019t get to be just a person here, going about my business \u2013 has haunted all the other pursuits, from science team to career. It\u2019s a matter of getting up each day and pushing myself again into a place some people think I have no right to occupy.</p> <p>My father is very old now. Lately, I brought up our ancient argument about who may occupy the White House, but he didn\u2019t remember it. The world has changed and so has he, urged forward by working daughters and granddaughters. He\u2019s ready and eager to vote for a woman president.

It\u2019s even harder to imagine Clinton indulging in the boorish self-aggrandisement, intellectual laziness, racism and vulgar contempt for the opposite gender that characterise her opponent. If anyone still doubts that the inexperienced man gets promoted ahead of the qualified woman, you can wake up now.</p> <p>This race is close. <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/ap-gfk-poll-most-believe-allegations-trump-women-193133070--election.html\">Polls tell us </a>most Americans believe Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations\">sexually assaulted women</a> (to name just one potential disqualifier).

  "<p>The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has reshuffled his government to boost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/11/alexis-tsipras-greece-criticises-creditors-thessaloniki\">bailout reforms</a> in the hope of getting the EU to agree to critical debt relief by the end of the year. </p> <p>Heralding a new political era for his country, the embattled leader said on Sunday the time had come to expedite measures demanded by international creditors and \u201cturn the page\u201d.

The Oxford-educated economics professor has won plaudits for his low-key efficacy, in sharp contrast to his forerunner, Yanis Varoufakis.<br></p> <p>Stergios Pitsiorlas, a veteran leftist who helped found the ruling Syriza party, was elevated to the position of deputy economy minister. In his previous role as chairman of Greece\u2019s privatisation agency, Pitsiorlas had been praised for his no-nonsense approach to disposing of cash-draining state assets. The shipping minister, Theodoros Dritsas, who was against further investment in Piraeus port by the Chinese conglomerate Cosco was among those dropped, while Panos Skourletis, the energy and environment minister, who had vehemently opposed the partial privatisation of the Public Power Corporation, was moved to the interior ministry. </p> <p>Skourletis, an established Syriza figure, was described by insiders as too powerful to be removed altogether. He was replaced by George Stathakis who had held the economy ministry portfolio. </p> <p>The septuagenarian leftist ideologue Aristides Baltas, who had been culture minister, was similarly replaced by Lydia Koniordou, Greece\u2019s foremost female classical actor. </p> <p>A new migration ministry was also established, reflecting the country\u2019s frontline role in the refugee crisis and allowing the deputy migration minister, Ioannis Mouzalas, to tap into resources and administrative backup in his promoted role as minister. <br></p> <p>The popularity of Tsipras\u2019s two-party coalition has been in free-fall. A Public Issue poll last week put the government 24 percentage points behind the centre right New Democracy, the main opposition party. Tax increases and sustained cuts to wages and benefits have corroded its support with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/greek-police-fire-teargas-at-pensioners-during-anti-austerity-protest-athens\">thousands of pensioners</a> recently taking to the streets in protest in Athens.</p> <p>With many of the measures beginning to bite this winter, the challenges remain immense for the country still seen as Europe\u2019s weakest link. Tsipras told his 48-member cabinet that by completing reforms Greece could \u201cfollow the roadmap\u201d of being included in the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme early next year, which would see the bank acquire Greek government debt. The government is also aiming to regain access to debt markets by the time its latest bailout expires in 2018. </p>",

He thought that journalists had become accessories to the powerful, rather than acting as a check upon them \u2013 in his view, journalism\u2019s role in a democratic society should be to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.</p> <p>It was not surprising that, in 2010, when WikiLeaks began publishing documents on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and then the US state department cables, Gavin became a close ally of the group and of its editor and founder, Julian Assange. While many of the institutions that profited from Assange\u2019s revelations later turned on him, Gavin was steadfastly loyal, seeing his role, as always, to stick up for those under fierce attack from powerful forces. Gavin and his wife Susan Benn were trustees of the Julian Assange Defence Fund, set up to help raise money for Assange\u2019s legal defence.</p> <p>Gavin\u2019s house in London was a salon and refuge for dissidents, journalists and revolutionaries from all over the world. People \u2013 often young, sometimes difficult \u2013 would stay for long periods and be fed and housed. \u201cI love it,\u201d Gavin once told me. \u201cI come down for breakfast and I don\u2019t know who is going to be there.\u201d He said the previous week \u201cthat brilliant Indian writer\u201d \u2013 Arundhati Roy \u2013 had been over with \u201cthat Hollywood actor with good politics\u201d \u2013 John Cusack. That was typical.</p> <p>The CIJ itself was wonderfully chaotic and breathed with creativity and energy. Gavin was an arch democrat, completely open to anyone and everyone. He wanted to stretch the definition of what an investigative journalist is, to include artists, historians and even architects who use society as their raw material and try to filter information to reveal truth. The CIJ was and remains an open shop.</p> <p>Born in Greeley, Colorado, to Marion Hall, a concert pianist, Gavin spent his formative years in Hyde Park, Chicago. He never knew his father, and in childhood took his stepfather\u2019s surname, MacFadyen. In the 1960s, he became an activist in the civil rights movement. In Chicago, he participated in the Rainbow Beach \u201cwade-ins\u201d of 1961 that challenged segregation on public beaches, and was arrested and jailed while protesting against discriminatory university housing, segregated restaurants and in defence of civil rights activists in the south.</p> <p>Gavin led a convoy of trucks filled with relief supplies to an embattled civil rights outpost in Tennessee. On arrival he discovered that police fire had pockmarked the truck with bullet holes, and on returning to Chicago he was informed that FBI agents had raided his house. In Chicago at this time, he met the young Bernie Sanders, then a student at Chicago University, and exposed him to the world of revolutionary leftist politics.</p> <p>By working subsequently as a longshoreman in New York, Gavin was able to pay for a trip to Britain, where he joined the International Socialists, living for a time in the home of one of its leading writers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/mar/27/guardianobituaries.books1\" title=\"\">Michael Kidron</a>. He described this as a formative period in developing his political consciousness.</p> <p>Gavin attended the London School of Film Technique (the forerunner to the London Film School) in 1964, and shortly after graduation he formed an independent collective, Chicago Films. He filmed the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, anti-war demonstrations and race riots in Detroit, Washington DC and Harlem for the BBC. As he became more interested in marrying his aesthetic commitment to film with his politics, he decided he wanted to make hard-hitting investigative documentaries.</p> <p>He produced and directed more than 50 documentaries, many for Granada Television\u2019s World in Action, in countries as diverse as Ecuador, Guyana, South Africa, Mexico, Hong Kong, Thailand, the USSR, the US, Sweden, India and Turkey. His investigations covered topics including industrial accidents, neo-Nazi violence in the UK, Chinese criminal societies, the history of the CIA, Watergate, election fraud in Guyana, the Iraq arms trade, child labour, nuclear proliferation, and Frank Sinatra\u2019s connection to organised crime.</p> <p>In 1980 Gavin left London to work in Hollywood. He became a close friend of the screenwriter, director and producer Michael Mann, and was involved in three of his films, as well as motion picture research projects in south-east Asia and a John Frankenheimer film project. He joined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/27/haskell-wexler\" title=\"\">Haskell Wexler</a> in Nicaragua to make the independent feature Latino in 1985. He also appeared as an actor in Latino, as well as two other movies, Thief (1981) and Ulterior Motives (1993).</p> <p>There was little time for small talk with Gavin; only the big ideas exercised him. He would throw his hands up when he got excited by a devious way of getting a story and shout \u201cyes, yes, YES!\u201d followed inevitably by \u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d Being around Gavin for any amount of time made you feel anything was possible and that, eventually, if Gavin was around to help, justice and the truth would prevail.</p> <p>One approach he favoured in the cause of linking social justice activism and investigative journalism was \u201cdirect action information gathering\u201d \u2013 for example, chaining yourself outside the offices of a multinational corporation or department of state and staying there until they gave you the information you needed for your story. He was unbreakable in his commitment to the oppressed, risked his own life and liberty to stand with them, and saw unspeakable acts of human brutality. Yet at the same time, none of it had broken down his ability to love and bring joy to those around him: his presence lit up any gathering.</p> <p>\u201cFor many journalists, work is simply a job,\u201d he once wrote. \u201cTheir interest is in lapdog confidences and dining with the powerful. Those who passionately want to provide a voice for those without one, and who fight hypocrisy and exploitation, are sadly rare.\u201d Gavin not only gave a voice to the voiceless. He handed them a megaphone.</p> <p>Gavin is survived by Susan, whom he married in 2010, his son Michael, from a previous marriage, to Virginia Daum, which ended in divorce, Susan\u2019s three daughters and six grandchildren.</p> <p><em> \u2022 </em>Gavin Hall MacFadyen, journalist, born 1 January 1940; died 22 October 2016</p>",
  "<p>Mention the name Trevor Noah in the US, and you might be met with a shrug, a sigh or a scoff. Many consider the South African comic\u2019s first year as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/29/the-daily-show-trevor-noah-clears-first-night-hurdles-as-host-but-only-just\">Jon Stewart\u2019s successor at The Daily Show</a> to have been a flop, a particularly excruciating one given the current political environment.

He has always been an exceptional performer, possessed of a charismatic glow that makes it hard to look away. At the second of two performances on Saturday night at the Beacon Theatre, he could have won over many of his detractors. </p> <p>Clad all in black, he was making a clear sartorial break from his Daily Show suits, and only rarely veered into politics. Instead, he talked about the possibilities and problems of a black James Bond, an epic night of drinking in Edinburgh, and his love and wonder at getting around New York City, where pedestrians are exceptionally trusting of the traffic signals because \u201cin America, if you\u2019ve got the white man on your side, you can do whatever you want\u201d.</p> <p>This type of material is where he excels. An extended bit about his time in Scotland was a reminder that the bread and butter of his standup has been his enthusiastic stories about travel and the people he\u2019s met. His greatest skill remains his ability with accents \u2013 he flipped through nearly a dozen foreign voices in the 75-minute show. A bit about Barack Obama\u2019s speaking style gave a peek into his process for producing such spot-on mimicry. </p> <p>But if there is one disappointment about Noah\u2019s show, it\u2019s the writing. A bit about the hypocrisy of anti-immigration nationalists in the UK and the US felt unsophisticated, while other jokes were clearly pandering to a liberal audience. He\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2015/10/15/did_trevor_noah_steal_dave_chappelles_joke_noahs_bit_on_the_racism_connoisseur_is_too_close_for_comfort/\">been accused of joke thievery</a> in the past, but his real crime seems to be that he\u2019s less interested in developing original material and more invested in using his talents to put on a good show.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/06/political-comedy-election-donald-trump-stephen-colbert\">Is the 2016 presidential campaign beyond satire?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And that puts him in a difficult spot. American standup, particularly in New York, is all about writing: there\u2019s not much appreciation for a mediocre joke told brilliantly. And The Daily Show may not be the best fit for him: he seems better suited to a big-tent network late-night show, where his gentle demeanor and genuine curiosity would be seen as assets rather than deficits. </p> <p>These shows were recorded for an upcoming Netflix special, but whether this apolitical hour of standup will win over his Daily Show doubters is uncertain \u2013 he\u2019ll never be the political whiz kid that some want him to be, and he really needs to be seen live in order to appreciate his charms. But maybe this will be a chance for America to see what Trevor Noah does best. </p>",

Clinton would be the first spouse of a president to reach the White House. Trump, at 70, would be the oldest person to assume the office.</p> <p>As both candidates and their surrogates set out on a whirlwind final 48 hours on the trail, the wild card nature of Trump\u2019s candidacy made the map harder to read than usual. Among 10 rallies planned over the last two days were stops in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/29/minnesota-nice-clinton-sanders-deadlocked-super-tuesday\">Minnesota</a>, which has not supported a Republican presidential nominee since 1972, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/08/bernie-sanders-wins-michigan-primary-hillary-clinton\">Michigan</a>, which has not gone to the GOP since 1988. Clinton, however, lost both states to Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary.</p> <p>Van Jones, a former adviser to Obama, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cBeds are damp. There is a crack in the blue wall and it has to do with trade. This is the ghost of Bernie Sanders.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump campaign claimed \u201can enormous surge in momentum and enthusiasm\u201d in recent days, citing Minnesota, where the campaign said that in less than 24 hours it had 18,000 RSVPs for a event that could hold 5,000 people. It now sees \u201cat least six different paths\u201d to victory, aides said.</p> <p>Dave Bossie, deputy campaign manager, told reporters: \u201cWe have expanded the map. We are on offence. We are going to places no one thought we would. It\u2019s an incredibly exciting time for our campaign. Hillary Clinton is on defence and her map is shrinking.

Take Forest, \u201cthe voice and friend of the smoker\u201d, which at least admits in nearly invisible small print that it is paid for by the tobacco industry.</p> <p>Now, however, manipulating social media has become part of the business of government. It may yet influence how governments are formed. Recent reports suggest that many of Donald Trump\u2019s most fervent online supporters are not themselves Americans, but Russians being paid by their government to help him win. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russian-online-troll-tells-samantha-bee-why-she-prefers-donald-trump_us_58184cafe4b0990edc3340d2\">One told Samantha Bee</a> that she pretends to be a housewife from Nebraska.

Even the <a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/special/2010-02/503820.html\">state-owned Global Times</a> reported with approval on the practice in 2010, citing Changsha\u2019s party office as the source of the name after it paid a team of commenters 600 yuan a month in 2004, plus half a yuan \u2013 hence \u201c50 cent\u201d \u2013 for each glowing post they made.</p> <p>Since then, paying stooges to praise your work online has become about as routine for local government in China as hiring traffic wardens. <a href=\"http://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/50c.pdf?m=1463683069\">A recent study at Harvard University</a> found that the Chinese authorities were placing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/chinese-officials-create-488m-social-media-posts-a-year-study-finds\">448m phony comments on the internet each year</a>. In an analysis of 43,800 pro-regime comments, the researchers concluded that 99.3% of them were made by civil servants from a wide variety of government departments. The postings tended to come in bursts at testing times, such as during protests or party meetings.</p> <p>Interestingly, few of the comments qualify as trolling, in the strict sense. Rather than attacking unbelievers, they focus on swamping the doubters with a flood of positive messages, or cleverly diverting the conversation. As with any job, some practitioners are laughably bad at it. In January 2014, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&amp;q=http://quartz.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1478195655507000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGs17wVP9NmQflJocJOU2xhA8V12g\">quartz.com</a> found many stooges <a href=\"http://qz.com/311832/hacked-emails-reveal-chinas-elaborate-and-absurd-internet-propaganda-machine/\">simply cutting and pasting a suggested question into an online discussion</a> with a party secretary in Ganzhou. \u201cIt seems like taxis are far more orderly than in past years,\u201d they all wanted to tell him.</p> <p>Two years before, however, Ai Weiwei interviewed an anonymous 26-year-old with very sophisticated methods. The young man, whose own family knew nothing of his work, estimated that 10-20% of the comments he saw were left by the 50 Cent Party. He described creating several identities in one forum, and structuring arguments between them so that the most authoritative voice could ultimately settle matters in the government\u2019s favour. Another tactic was to be deliberately provocative, and thus draw public anger on to himself and away from the authorities. \u201cSometimes I feel like I have a split personality,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I like it or hate it.

Employees were expected to post on news articles 50 times a day. Those who wrote blogs had to maintain six Facebook accounts and publish at least three posts daily. On Twitter, they had to have at least 10 accounts, on which they would tweet 50 times.

In Hebrew it\u2019s called <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.541142\">\u201chasbara\u201d, literally meaning \u201cexplanation\u201d</a>, and it involves trying to improve the world\u2019s opinion of the country and its causes. Accordingly there are around 350 official Israeli online channels, covering the full range of social media. For instance, besides its well-known Twitter accounts in English, Hebrew and Arabic, the Israeli Defence Force <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/idfonline/\">even has its own Pinterest page</a>, featuring photo collections with themes such as \u201cSoldiers\u2019 Stories\u201d and \u201cIDF Style\u201d.</p> <p>In 2013, the Israeli government revealed that it would also recruit \u201ccovert units\u201d however. These would be staffed by a mixture of international supporters and domestic students, whose high intelligence, low income and familiarity with social media make them generally well suited to professional trolling. \u201cWe need a unified effort to explain why we have a legal right to be here in Israel,\u201d the <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Government-to-use-citizens-as-army-in-social-media-war-322972\">Knesset member Dov Lipman told the Jerusalem Post</a>. \u201cThat is key to defeat the movements pushing to boycott, divest and sanction Israel.\u201d Those who signed up would get quick access to government information, and leaders of student groups would also be awarded scholarships.</p> <p>Sure enough, during the war in Gaza the following summer, a student group called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/16/israel-hamas-clash-social-media\">Israel Under Fire</a> emerged as one of many voices promoting the Israeli side of the story. \u201cWe counter Palestinian propaganda and explain the Israeli perspective,\u201d the group\u2019s leader, Yarden Ben-Yosef, said. \u201cSocial media is another place where the war goes on. This is another way to tell our story.\u201d We do not know whether Israel Under Fire was itself one of these covert units, or whether Ben-Yosef got a scholarship.

The i-army.org site itself, where volunteers can join, is certainly <a href=\"https://meduza.io/\">not very appealing to outsiders</a>. It is a crazed and relentless jumble of unflattering stories about Russia \u2013 from details about the MH17 air crash, to doping by its athletes, to unsubstantiated allegations from the western media that Putin is a paedophile. \u201cDo not let yourself be deceived \u2013 spread the truth!\u201d the site says, rousingly.</p> <p>More obvious signs of life can be found on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i_army_org\">i-army\u2019s Twitter page</a>. This is very active, with 12,800 followers, which isn\u2019t bad, and retweets regularly runs into dozens or hundreds. Clearly some of its followers have been arguing Ukraine\u2019s case online, but the tweets themselves are not very persuasive, offering photographs of captured Russian military hardware, dry political statements and sudden comic memes about Russia\u2019s federal reserves, for example.</p> <p>The account\u2019s wallpaper perhaps tells you everything you need to know about the Information Policy Ministry \u2013 or the \u201cMinistry of Truth\u201d, as some Ukrainian wags prefer. It depicts a group of noble white knights carrying the ministry\u2019s logo into battle against, literally, an army of fantastical trolls (who rather incongruously carry the logos of RT television and Russia 24). No matter how sympathetic one might feel towards the Ukrainian cause, it is hard not to feel that this particular region of the conflict needs a lighter touch.</p> <p><strong>Estimated troops</strong> A few hundred.</p> <p><strong>Favourite subjects</strong> Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.</p> <h2> UK</h2> <p>The so-called \u201cTwitter Troops\u201d of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/31/british-army-facebook-warriors-77th-brigade\">the 77th Brigade</a> were somewhat misunderstood by the media when the new army unit was created last year. In fact social media was just one example of many non-military skills that the specialist soldiers were intended to bring to the army. And in any case, the MoD informs me, it would not be a soldier\u2019s job to launch a disinformation campaign on the battlefield, even if they had the time.</p> <p>You don\u2019t hear much about JTRIG in Britain, however, and they do just this kind of thing. Indeed the very existence of the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group was a national secret until documents from Edward Snowden were published <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/06/22/controversial-gchq-unit-domestic-law-enforcement-propaganda\">by Glenn Greenwald and Andrew Fishman in 2014</a>. And they reveal a very busy group of people, whose work within GCHQ was intended to help everyone from the police and MI5 to the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Bank of England.</p> <p><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/\">Some of JTRIG\u2019s tactics</a>, such as hacking into websites and setting up sexual \u201choneypot\u201d stings, sound more or less like conventional spying. Others were carefully designed to manipulate and deceive. <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/document/2015/06/22/behavioural-science-support-jtrig/\">In the words of the leaked document</a>, these included \u201cUploading YouTube videos containing persuasive messages; establishing online aliases with Facebook and Twitter accounts, blogs and forum memberships \u2026 sending spoof emails and text messages as well as providing spoof online resources; and setting up spoof trade sites.\u201d</p> <p>Some of this sounds reasonable, and frankly welcome, such as disrupting the online activities of terrorists or child abusers. Indeed, if it still exists, JTRIG seems to target specific groups or individuals, rather than trying to influence public opinion. Which groups, however, and who chooses them, might be a legitimate concern. The document mentions the English Defence League, for example, whose members were no doubt not happy to be included. For its part, GCHQ will only say that all its work is legal.</p> <p><strong>Estimated troops</strong> A few dozen.</p> <p><strong>Favourite subjects</strong> Sex, drugs, not travelling to Syria please.</p> <h2><strong> </strong>North Korea, South Korea</h2> <p>Most North Koreans\u2019 experience of social media is none at all, unless they have been given an illicit glimpse by a foreigner or a government official. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/01/north-korea-announces-blocks-on-facebook-twitter-and-youtube\">Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are all officially blocked</a>, just in case. Domestically, there is thus no online opinion for the regime to bother about controlling. (Unless they <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36416970\">launch their own version of Facebook</a>, as some <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/03/13/a-rare-glimpse-of-north-koreas-version-of-facebook/\">believe they plan to</a>.) Across the border, however, just about all South Koreans have smartphones, KakaoTalk and the fastest internet in the world. They also have <a href=\"http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/08/13/2013081300891.html\">about 200 North Korean trolls to contend with</a>, according to a report published by a South Korean think-tank, the Police Policy Institute, in 2013. In total the report estimated that North Korean agents had posted 41,373 pieces of propaganda in 2012. (That\u2019s about one every two days per agent, which is hardly Stakhanovite.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ae12b9bde9fa8009aed49a29c0a29076e02257e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae12b9bde9fa8009aed49a29c0a29076e02257e8/0_0_2362_3283/719.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration: Joe Magee\" width=\"719\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration: Joe Magee</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Joe Magee</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given the extreme strangeness of the regime in Pyongyang, it is easy to presume that they would not know how to talk to a sophisticated southern audience. In fact their approach, as revealed in the report, is rather clever. Instead of hammering people with outlandish and unconvincing Juche propaganda in the usual North Korean way, Pyongyang\u2019s trolls focus on areas that are still debated in the south \u2013 such as whether to give southerners access to sites (currently blocked) that praise the northern regime. Aware that recently started accounts with little background often arouse suspicion, northern agents also tend to work behind identities stolen from real southern users.</p> <p>Clearly the problem has been serious enough for South Korea to react, and indeed to overreact. For years the country\u2019s National Intelligence Service has been routinely posting messages of its own to attack those coming from the north, and at times these have allegedly <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/15/world/asia/south-korean-agents-accused-of-tarring-opposition-before-election.html?_r=0\">strayed into attacks on South Korea\u2019s own opposition parties</a>. Last year the country\u2019s former intelligence chief Won Sei-hoon was convicted of trying to influence the outcome of the 2012 presidential election in favour of the incumbent Park Geun-hye. A retrial has since been ordered, but in the original Won was alleged to be running a team of nine agents who used at least 658 Twitter identities to post many thousands of messages to discredit the north \u2013 and also, in the case of 274,800 messages, <a href=\"https://revolution-news.com/south-korea-50k-protest-national-intelligence-service-election-rigging\">to smear President Park\u2019s opponents</a>, who were described as, among other things, \u201cleftist followers of North Korea\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Estimated troops</strong> 200 (north) 9 (south).</p> <p><strong>Favourite subject</strong> Whether North Korea is a) paradise b) paranoid.</p> <h2> Turkey</h2> <p>President Erdo\u011fan was taught a lesson by the Gezi Park protests of 2013. Not, unfortunately, that Turks should be allowed to live more freely, but that he should take control of social media, with which they had organised themselves against him. By the end of the summer, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) had begun recruiting <a href=\"http://www.dailysabah.com/elections/2015/05/11/ak-party-founded-new-turkey-digital-office-for-the-general-elections-on-june-7\">a team of 6,000 social media operatives</a>. \u201cWe aim at developing a positive political language which we are teaching to our volunteers,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323527004579079151479634742\">a party official told the Wall Street Journal at the time</a>. \u201cAnd when the opposing camp spreads disinformation about the party, we correct them with valid information, always using positive language.\u201d But not always being open about it. When asked to name some of the people who would be correcting this misinformation, the official declined.</p> <p>Sadly for Erdo\u011fan and the AKP, <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/politics/turkey-twitter-trolls/\">their new army of volunteers proved overenthusiastic and, let\u2019s say, under-subtle</a>. In the months that followed it became common for those who even mildly criticised the government to be <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/09/turkey-elections-akp-mulls-dumping-social-media-trolls.html#\">showered with far from positive remarks</a>. Often the abuse arrived in bursts, from people with not very convincing profiles, making accusations that were not only bizarre but bizarrely similar. For instance when the journalist <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/11/akp-social-media-twitter-facebook.html\">Emre Kizilkaya criticised the government\u2019s handling of a hostage negotiation</a> in October, he found himself repeatedly accused of \u201cZionism\u201d.</p> <p>At times the \u201cAK Trolls\u201d, as they became known, spread false stories. In July 2014, it was reported that they started a fake Twitter account supposedly from the musician Erkan Ogur, used it to tweet controversial comments about the state intelligence services, then complained about \u201chis\u201d tweets to the AKP authorities in Sakarya, who promptly cancelled Ogur\u2019s forthcoming concert there. Later, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s own daughter Sumeyye was apparently recorded asking one of his advisers for help from \u201cour trolls\u201d. When recordings allegedly showing Erdo\u011fan\u2019s own corruption began to spread on Twitter in the spring of 2014, he simply (but not very effectively) shut Twitter down.</p> <p>Perhaps aware that this Putinesque farce wasn\u2019t making the AKP more popular, the party changed tack just before the general elections last spring, launching the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turkish-president-s-social-media-campaigners-deny-being-a-troll-army-10301599.html\">New Turkey Digital Office</a>, which would henceforth dish out more conventional online propaganda. \u201cAll of our accounts will be officially announced,\u201d spokesman Besir Atalay told the Turkish media. \u201cOur messages will be determined at the party headquarters. None of the other accounts would be related to us, including those ones [the trolls].\u201d Nevertheless the AKP lost its majority in the elections. Then regained it in new elections later in the year.</p> <p><strong>Estimated troops</strong> Formerly 6,000, probably still 6,000.</p> <p><strong>Favourite subjects</strong> Standing up to the Kurds, standing up to Russia, standing up to Arabs, standing up to Israel \u2026</p>",
  "<p>In the beginning, Donald Trump simply wouldn\u2019t allow the press to eat cold meats from the buffet.<br></p> <p>Trump was holding a house party in suburban New Hampshire in late June 2015. The main event was around a backyard swimming pool under a fickle summer sky. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2016/nov/02/a-z-of-trump-26-illustrators-picture-a-ghastly-future-in-pictures\">A-Z of Trump: 26 illustrators imagine a 'ghastly' future \u2013\u00a0in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The family hosting the presidential candidate had a 22-year-old son who was a Trump superfan. He had somehow coaxed the candidate to appear at the backyard event. Before the speech, there would be a reception for invited guests with hors d\u2019oeuvres stacked on the family\u2019s dining room table. But this was for invited guests only. Reporters, let alone more plebeian Trump supporters, were not permitted to partake. </p> <p>Otherwise, there were no press pens as reporters stood intermingled in the crowd with ardent Tea Partiers and curious onlookers there to see a television celebrity who had somehow ended up in Bedford, New Hampshire, for the evening.</p> <p>Trump delivered a long, winding monologue of the sort that would later become his trademark as he veered from dire warnings about illegal immigrants to praise for executives at Comcast and an extended and impassioned anecdote about how professional politicians couldn\u2019t recognize low-quality highway guardrails.</p> <p>The event, with more than 200 people was one of the rare times that Trump attempted anything approaching traditional retail politics. As he soared in the polls, Trump became a phenomenon who packed arenas and stadiums across much of the south. By September 2015, even the gesture of a retail stop at a tailgate outside an Iowa v Iowa State football game turned into a mob scene. The candidate was swarmed by people chanting his name and reaching out to somehow touch him as a pack of bodyguards protected Trump from getting too close to the masses outside the stadium.</p> <p>It was during this period that the Guardian interviewed Trump in a New Hampshire hotel conference room after he had addressed a non-partisan event designed to focus on \u201cproblem solving\u201d. He was gracious and soft-spoken if vague on policy detail. He broadly endorsed several progressive priorities like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/oct/13/donald-trump-police-body-cameras-video\">federal funding for police body cameras</a> and rail transit while striking his typical isolationist notes on foreign policy. The interview was filmed and it was noteworthy how keenly aware he was of the camera and how carefully he positioned himself for it. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/oct/13/donald-trump-putin-assad-humanitarian-foreign-policy-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4d8yz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2388066\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump talks to the Guardian about Syria and his worldview \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"The Guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-561c4e15e4b0fed5dcd57348\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/10/13/20101012TRUMPFOREIGNPOLICY_FromGuAmRM-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10872835&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/10/13/20101012TRUMPFOREIGNPOLICY_FromGuAmRM/20101012TRUMPFOREIGNPOLICY_FromGuAmRM.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10872835&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/10/13/20101012TRUMPFOREIGNPOLICY_FromGuAmRM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/oct/13/donald-trump-putin-assad-humanitarian-foreign-policy-video\">Ben Jacobs interviews Donald Trump in October 2015</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Instead, Trump became a candidate of big venues and big speeches. Once or twice a day in high school gyms or a convention center in Iowa or New Hampshire, the Republican nominee would put on his show. By the autumn of 2015, Trump had acquired secret service protection and all the other accoutrements of a general election candidate, despite the fact that he was a political novice who had never appeared on a ballot. Reporters were caged in a press pen, unable to freely roam and mingle with voters once the nominee was in the vicinity. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4770e9233e6284dba23b775f979df83acbaace39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4770e9233e6284dba23b775f979df83acbaace39/0_57_2500_1501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supporters jeer at protesters during a campaign rally in Burlington, Vermont, on 7 January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump supporters jeer at protesters during a campaign rally in Burlington, Vermont, on 7 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erin Siegal/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His campaign stops became must-see events, especially in states where visits from presidential candidates were rarities. Trump rallies seemed to resemble rock concerts more than anything previously seen in presidential politics. In a January 2016 rally in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/08/donald-trump-burlington-vermont-bernie-sanders-home-turf\">Bernie Sanders heartland of Burlington, Vermont,</a> lines stretched for blocks in the bitter cold as thousands of people congregated to see Trump in a downtown theater. Many were taking their minds off the weather by drinking steadily as they waited and the street was soon littered with empty beer cans. </p> <p>The atmosphere was just as unusual inside the Trump rallies. The Republican candidate\u2019s events became ground zero for protests over a variety of issues, ranging from his vehement anti-immigrant rhetoric to his advocacy of a ban on Muslims entering the United States. In Burlington, a liberal college town, Trump staffers were eagle-eyed at the door, requiring attendees to take loyalty pledges to enter. That wasn\u2019t enough to stop the event from being repeatedly interrupted, with the candidate urging: \u201cTake him out. Get him out of here. Don\u2019t give him his coat!\u201d as one heckler was ejected. </p> <p>Repeated disruptions became routine, along with actual outbreaks of violence. The disturbing trend culminated in a cancelled rally in Chicago, which descended into chaos. The candidate didn\u2019t take the stage as the venue in the heart of deep Democratic blue, ethnically diverse Chicago was filled with protesters. When the announcement came that Trump was not taking the stage, fights quickly broke out throughout the arena. Such scenes of political violence had not been seen in decades in the United States.</p> <p>The next day, Trump\u2019s rally in Cleveland had about a dozen interruptions from protesters, something which would have been astonishing had it happened in any other year to any other candidate. Instead, there was no violence and no attempt by Trump to encourage violence and it just seemed like the new normal as he sneered at those who were escorted out, claiming that they were sent by \u201cour communist friend\u201d, Bernie Sanders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"74deab6dfdee962f34212028ceb834ba8ec4863f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74deab6dfdee962f34212028ceb834ba8ec4863f/0_233_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump holds forth in Miami, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump holds forth in Miami.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it wasn\u2019t just the crowds at Trump\u2019s events, which were unusual. It was the candidate\u2019s rhetoric. On a daily basis, Trump made statements that were just astonishing by any traditional standard, comparing a rival to a child molester, or linking another\u2019s father to a plot to kill President Kennedy. In the course of a single day on the campaign trail in South Carolina, Trump both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/18/donald-trump-pope-francis-christian-wall-mexico-border\">attacked the pope</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/19/trump-appears-to-endorse-executing-terrorists-citing-questionable-history\">accused</a> one of the most decorated American soldiers in history of committing war crimes. The statements had no effect on his standing in the polls and he won a commanding victory only a few days later in the South Carolina primary. </p> <p>Trump finally clinched the Republican nomination in early May when Ted Cruz dropped out after the Indiana primary. His next event was a raucous rally in a grim brutalist arena in Charleston, West Virginia. It had been scheduled in advance of the state\u2019s primary. Hours before it started, the crowd outside formed a disorderly horde in red and white Make America Great Again hats. Once Trump finally took the stage in the dank 60s-era construction in the dilapidated downtown, he strutted about the stage triumphantly, suggesting to attendees that they didn\u2019t need to bother to vote in the primary any more as he boasted about his abiding love and affection for coal and coalminers.</p> <p>In the weeks that followed, there was no pivot to a general election. Instead, Trump seemed nostalgic for the intra-Republican contest as he travelled the length of California in advance of the state\u2019s June primary, as well as taking a bizarre trip to Scotland to see his golf course in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38a80d8bb302532b77a4f7c25bdc0b5fb18b29cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38a80d8bb302532b77a4f7c25bdc0b5fb18b29cb/17_0_3884_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at the Republican national convention in Cleveland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at the Republican national convention in Cleveland: a grim, depressing slog.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Semansky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Trump officially became the nominee in July, it was at a convention in Cleveland that was more banal than anyone could have imagined. Although Trump had promised star-studded festivities and there were fears that protests in the surrounding streets would rival the dramatic scenes outside the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, it was instead a grim, depressing slog. </p> <p>In lieu of celebrities, there was former Happy Days actor Scott Baio and, instead of graceful concession speeches, former rival Ted Cruz urged Republicans to \u201cvote their conscience\u201d in what was widely viewed as a snub to Trump. Much of the effort seemed to be focused on stopping anti-Trump rebels from forcing any vote or coming close to any open display of dissatisfaction. No one had any illusions that Trump could somehow be thwarted. </p> <p>The nomination was secured after more than a week of grinding procedural warfare replete with the type of tactical chicanery that one would have expected from smoke- not iPhone-filled rooms. Anti-Trump petitions mysteriously disappeared, wavering delegates were subjected to intense pressure and every available scrap of procedure was put to good use. For a moment, he was just like any other candidate overseeing a political organization.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1cade843148294df123422a9b0da647847a1ccf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cade843148294df123422a9b0da647847a1ccf1/0_0_2203_1322/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s campaign CEO, attends a rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s campaign CEO and Breitbart editor, attends a rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paul Manafort, the shadowy veteran campaign aide who had finally elbowed out Trump\u2019s longtime campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, after an intense turf war, oversaw all of these efforts. For his reward, he was unceremoniously fired less than a month later after growing reports of his ties to Russia and acrimony within the highest ranks of the Trump campaign.</p> <p>At that point, the campaign came under the control of Steve Bannon, the editor of the rightwing site Breitbart. Working in concert with veteran GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway, Trump abandoned his unscripted rallies and began using a teleprompter exclusively. He also hunkered down, avoiding the media outside of deeply conservative talk radio and Fox News.</p> <p>In personal unguarded interactions, Trump was genial with the press. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/donald-trump-campaign-ohio-fair-plane-media\">When the Guardian accompanied him on his personal plane</a> in September as a pool reporter, he chatted freely with handful of journalists who accompanied him and went out of his way to be gracious.

There was no more open violence or unruliness. Protesters had become rare. Instead, they became venues for Trump to share his rage over the \u201crigged system\u201d and stir up an angry crowd \u2013 against the media, against Hillary Clinton, against \u201cglobalists\u201d and a host of other villains.</p> <p>Attendees showed up in bitter T-shirts proclaiming that they were \u201cdeplorable\u201d and took up Trump\u2019s invitation to deride reporters.</p> <p>At one rally in Cincinnati in October, the traveling press was booed by a crowd of roughly 15,000 as it entered the arena. </p> <p>Trump had stopped trying to be a normal candidate but he was no longer being Trump. It was a dark hybrid. He had lost much of the freewheeling joie de vivre that had taken him to strange, albeit controversial places. Instead, he had become a relatively coherent figure, articulating a clear world view \u2013 but one that was deeply paranoid and out of the mainstream, where the press was no longer a stalking horse but simply the enemy.<br></p>",

It was popularised by a Karl Astel, a National Socialist university rector who declared tobacco an \u201cenemy of the people\u201d, when not otherwise busy on the racialist eugenics programme and trying to set up an SS university. You cannot keep a good bad phrase down.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/enemies-of-the-people-british-newspapers-react-judges-brexit-ruling\">British newspapers react to judges' Brexit ruling: 'Enemies of the people'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a democratic culture, the way we communicate our political battles is heated when contentious subjects are in play. Yet language, in such circumstances, is not just the funnel of arguments. It has its own momentum and impact, deepening divides and replacing the instinct of moderation and compromise with the assumption that anyone who disagrees with the speaker must be an idiot or traitor.</p> <p>I say all this not as a Brexit wound-licker, hoping the lofty men in wigs will magically unravel the result of a referendum. Legal language often hides its own self-importance behind big words. Brexit, the ruling claims, is \u201cjusticiable\u201d, which is a fancy way of judges deciding that it is fine for them to rule on the triggering of a policy decision taken by the prime minister about the exit mechanism from the EU.</p> <p>Increasingly, from press freedom to the PM\u2019s day job, there is little judges don\u2019t feel is their duty to rule on. That presents a serious risk of the balance of power tipping too much to the courts, which do not, as their backers in this case claim, just \u201cuphold\u201d law, but re-interpret it with a view to challenge or changing a political decision.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78fe1d3880847e05bdaa9a91e57f4db1a04fb845\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78fe1d3880847e05bdaa9a91e57f4db1a04fb845/0_146_5111_3066/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam James (Hovstad) and Hugh Bonneville (Dr Tomas Stockmann) in Chichester Festival theatre\u2019s production of Ibsen\u2019s An Enemy of the People earlier this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam James (Hovstad) and Hugh Bonneville (Dr Tomas Stockmann) in Chichester Festival theatre\u2019s production of Ibsen\u2019s An Enemy of the People earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many progressives support this, in the high court\u2019s recent example, because the change happens to suit their own wishes. But when a democratic vote has taken place with high participation, there is a question mark over using the courts to throw sands in the wheels of what follows.</p> <p>So we should expect this to be hard fought on both sides. And that is exactly the time at which language needs to be tempered, namely, when we feel least like being temperate. Alas, a particularly fractious zeitgeist is our backdrop. Exhibit A, as we contemplate the US election, is Donald Trump\u2019s crass demagoguery and hokey claim to an \u201cauthentic\u201d people-speak, concealing a nihilistic prospectus for power.</p> <p>It is, however, glib to fault only the rhetoric of those we dislike. Look, too, to the kind of language used by those who would proudly disparage Trump and the Brexiters \u2013 and accord a too comfortable moral equivalence. It\u2019s so easy to arrive at a point where a set menu of phrases shows that we have stopped thinking about the alternative position at all. So as soon as someone starts a sneery conversation featuring air quotes around the \u201c\u00a3350m for the NHS\u201d claim in the referendum campaign, and around \u201cexperts\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d, I know that they have probably not given much thought as to what drove the Brexit vote and why these arguments prevailed over their own.</p> <p>Just as surely, we know that the words \u201cmigrants\u201d and \u201cbreaking point\u201d were intentioned to alarm voters and quell arguments about the balancing benefits of immigration.</p> <p>Whingeing or listening back to an echo chamber of the like-minded will not address this. Liberals have not done a good job. On both sides of the Atlantic, they slip into a reactive language of being \u201cterrified\u201d or declaring political events \u201ccatastrophic\u201d, when they mean that they are troublesome, difficult or just not to their taste.

A fair point. But the question of where to draw the line \u2013 and how to do so will decide whether we make things worse or better. Overdo it and liberals come across as pearl-clutching hysterics loath to be challenged. Without doubt, that was one of the traits and tonal inadequacies that let down the Remain camp\u2019s arguments. Do we go down the road suggested by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/alastair-campbell-new-labour-tony-blair-immigration-brexit\">Alastair Campbell, formerly New Labour bruiser</a>, last week suggesting that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/campbellclaret?lang=en-gb\"><em>Mail</em>\u2019s editor</a> be arraigned for incitement to hatred?

We could easily run around for the next few years, trading aggressions and caging every unwelcome thought as an \u201cincitement\u201d to something or other. My right to speak out is your micro-aggression. Down the plughole, meanwhile, goes the culture of debate, a British asset better valued in the rest of the world than at home right now.

  "<p>Dalia was 16 and living in a refugee camp in Lebanon when she was married.

She says: \u201cI was in the 11th grade, expecting to go to university in two years. If it was to happen again, I wouldn\u2019t get married at 16. I won\u2019t let this happen to my daughter.\u201d </p> <p>Child marriage is far from unusual. According to new research from Save the Children, <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=8rKLIXMGIpI4E&amp;b=9357115&amp;ct=14926603&amp;notoc=1\">one girl under 15 is married every seven seconds</a>.

However, they do not necessarily realise the violence that girls face within the context of marriage.\u201d</p> <p>The cycle of violence in which girls find themselves caught up, according to UNFPA, is horrifying. NGO workers say that many young girls think getting married sounds better to being stuck in a refugee camp tent with their family members \u2013 where, at best they will have little privacy and at worst they suffer abuse. This can come from other residents or their own family members. </p> <p>But once faced with the reality of what it means to be a wife \u2013 no school, no playing, staying at home, and having to have sex and bear children \u2013 they find their young bodies and minds are not ready to cope. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>During the four months that I was married he always hit me</p> <footer> <cite>'Zada', Syrian refugee child bride</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Zada, 18, first met her husband when he came to propose.

Zada told the Guardian via an interpreter: \u201cI thought that my life with him would be so beautiful, as when we were engaged he was so kind to me and he showed me love. But after marriage I discovered that everything he told me was a lie. He was having sex with other girls, he raped me many times, when he was not at home his brother would sexually harass me and when I told my husband, he did not believe me \u2013 instead he hit me. During the four months that I was married he always hit me.\u201d </p> <p>Now Zada lives with her family and can\u2019t go outside because her husband \u2013 from whom she is now separated \u2013 has threatened her.<strong> </strong>\u201cI can\u2019t leave the house, I can\u2019t work and the only thing that I want is to go back to school and am not allowed because I am under threat,\u201d<strong> </strong>she says.

The idea is to make sure girls can make informed choices on marriage \u2013 with opportunities for economic, social and psychological development before marriage. \u201cWe also invest in empowering the girls to say no to child marriage,\u201d says Ramanathan Balakrishnan, UNFPA representative. \u201cOften, girls do marry due to lack of alternative life options when they are in the camp.\u201d<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It is one of the most depressing situations I have ever seen</p> <footer> <cite>Nagore Moran-Llovet, Plan International</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But refugee girls are not the only ones affected.

  "<p>The restaurant at the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/trump-international-hotel-washington-opening-protests\">Trump International Hotel</a> in Washington wasn\u2019t empty on Thursday night. But it wasn\u2019t full either. The handful of diners could look down on the marbled lobby and bar and see four TVs: two tuned to American football, one to basketball and a fourth to conservative Fox News \u2013 including election ads for the final days of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.</p> <p>\u201cThe style is jubilant,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dominicvorvlaw1\">Dominic Vorv</a>, 50, a lawyer with a cowboy hat who dined on ribeye steak as banal pop music wafted through the former post office. \u201cMy clients are impressed. My voice does not reverberate here because it\u2019s a large place. You can talk and no one listens to your business to find out: are you a Republican, are you a Democrat?\u201d</p> <p><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-opens-international-hotel-campaign-trail-brand\">The glitzy hotel</a> on Pennsylvania Avenue stands 723 short steps from the White House. Vorv, a Latino from New Mexico who says his legal clients include strippers, hopes that Trump will add the Oval Office to his portfolio on Tuesday. \u201cThe city has been waiting for a leader,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we get is politicians.\u201d</p> <p>Washington has been home to every US president since <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/johnadams\">John Adams</a>, the second president, in 1800. He and his successors have variously embraced the city or seldom ventured beyond the mansion grounds. George W Bush was rarely seen out at night, whereas Barack Obama has helped DC unbutton its collar. So how would Trump or Hillary Clinton fit in?</p> <p>Politically, at least, one would feel right at home while the other would be a square peg in a round hole.

The brash New York businessman\u2019s travelling circus of celebrity, braggadocio and vulgarity would not be likely to impress the capital\u2019s liberal intellectuals, and Trump\u2019s aesthetic taste clashes with the city\u2019s austere marble and concrete. Even his $212m hotel, with its share of chandeliers and gold leaf, is relatively toned down from the faux Versailles aspirations of his properties in Florida and New York.</p> <p>Nor would Trump find similarities between his voters and the city\u2019s demographics: almost half the population of Washington is African American, part of a group that has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/13/new-polls-in-pennsylvania-and-ohio-show-donald-trump-with-0-percent-of-the-black-vote/\">for months</a> rejected him.

He likes the crowds. If he\u2019s in a restaurant, he\u2019d want to be the centre of attention. With Trump, not only would you have glitz but what put him on the map, as well as being a real estate developer, was being a TV star. He\u2019s an entertainer and there would be showmanship. With Ronald Reagan, it was like he was playing a film role; with Trump, it would be his biggest role yet.\u201d</p> <p>But the real stars, Kendall believes, would be Clinton\u2019s daughter Chelsea, 36, or Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, 35.

They favoured the Tex-Mex restaurant Cactus Cantina but otherwise preferred their ranch in Texas. The Obamas, in contrast, have been regulars on the restaurant circuit: there was a stop at Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl on U Street and they celebrated the president\u2019s most recent birthday at Fiola Mare in Georgetown. They have visited bookshops and the Kennedy Center but have been perhaps less visible on the city\u2019s vibrant culture scene <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/a-master-of-pop-culture-had-little-to-do-with-the-high-arts/2016/09/02/e84e8de2-64a7-11e6-be4e-23fc4d4d12b4_story.html\">than some had hoped</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI wish they\u2019d come to theatre more,\u201d said Giardina, whose political play, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/manners-and-politics-collide-in-arena-stages-city-of-conversation/2016/02/05/52d88a38-cc22-11e5-88ff-e2d1b4289c2f_story.html\">The City of Conversation</a>, was produced by the Arena Stage.

It is hard to picture him poring over the reconstruction of <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/jefflib.html\">Thomas Jefferson\u2019s library</a> at the Library of Congress, or the First Folios at the <a href=\"http://www.folger.edu/\">Folger Shakespeare Library</a>. </p> <p>But he has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/donald-trump-diet.html?_r=0\">publicised his diet via social media</a>: a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken, a McDonald\u2019s burger and fries and, in a contrived appeal to Latino voters, a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/07/26/dining/food-fails-presidential-edition.html\">taco bowl</a>.

Maybe he will just drink at his own bar.\u201d</p> <p>But Holzherr does hope that whoever wins will spend time exploring where they live. \u201cI like it when a president really lives in DC versus living in the White House.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u201cSome of this reminds me of dropping a big stone in a pond,\u201d Terry Phillips mused over lunch at the Glenville Queen diner, just outside of Schenectady, New York. \u201cYou get this big wave. And then it hits the shore and bounces back, and then it comes back again, but it\u2019s much smaller and muted. But those little waves are still going back and forth.\u201d</p> <p>Phillips, a former district governor for Rotary International and an engineer by trade, moved to Schenectady more than 30 years ago to work at General Electric (GE), once the largest single employer in the region. </p> <p>But in 1974, General Electric moved its headquarters from New York City to a more expansive facility in Fairfield, Connecticut and, between that and the tectonic shifts in America\u2019s economy, the successive waves of downsizing changed the city and the surrounding area in ways nobody could have predicted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/05/swing-state-voters-donald-trump-youngstown-ohio\">Youngstown, Ohio: why voters are supporting Trump in a bellwether city</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The loss of jobs at GE \u2013 which, at its height, employed about 30,000 workers in a vertically integrated manufacturing facility with back office functions for the rest of the corporation \u2013 transformed Schenectady (like the loss of so many other manufacturers would transform so many other manufacturing communities) into a very different and not altogether better place for the people who had located their lives here.</p> <p>Only about 5,600 people worked in manufacturing in the county in 2011 \u2013 total. General Electric has <a href=\"http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/GE-plans-large-scale-renovation-in-Schenectady-6772801.php\">only about 4,000 employees</a> there now. The largest employment sectors are healthcare and retail work; as part of an economic development plan, the state licensed a casino at the site of one of the manufacturing facilities once used by GE and the 1,500 jobs it will bring to the area is considered a huge boon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33c4ab757cb54ef890a4f0b2e98f572e244ca547\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33c4ab757cb54ef890a4f0b2e98f572e244ca547/148_86_5722_3433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"General Electric in Schenectady, NY 1920s\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">General Electric in Schenectady, New York, in the 1920s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grems-Doolittle Library Schenectady County Historical Society</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What happened to Schenectady as a result of GE scaling back its operations in the area isn\u2019t a unique story: you could write a similar piece about any American rust belt town. But maybe to understand the very real economic anxiety that people feel  here it helps to understand the sense of security with which many people grew up.</p> <p>Sitting in the living room of his house in Scotia \u2013 a suburb just across the river that was developed as the middle class, created by well-paying jobs at GE, increased the demand for housing in the area \u2013 Bernie Witkowski reminisced about the role the company played in his family. \u201cWhen [my dad] got a job with General Electric, that was it. I mean, that was the dream, OK?\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe GE was the thing. Almost all my uncles worked for General Electric in Schenectady, everybody worked for GE. And when I was brought up, that\u2019s what we heard all the time. \u2018Oh, when you get out of high school, you go to GE, you go to GE.\u2019\u201d he explained. \u201cMy cousins went to GE. I went.\u201d</p> <p>He started as a stock boy in March of 1967 after high school and moved into the electrician apprentice program before he was drafted in 1968 and went to Vietnam. When he got out, he went back and spent the rest of his working years at the company. \u201cThere was no reason to leave because it was a good job,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a great job.\u201d</p> <p>Don Chapadeau was a lifer at General Electric, too: he started there in 1973 and retired after 42 years. \u201cMy father was employed by GE \u2013 he worked in Utica [about 75 miles west of Schenectady] \u2013 and my grandfather was GE,\u201d he explained. \u201cBack in the 70s, that was the place to be.\u201d</p> <p>Like Witkowski, Chapadeau joined the company straight out of high school in 1973. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go to college, I worked with my hands, so it was the place to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI did everything from clean toilets to build turbines and generators.\u201d</p> <p>At the beginning of their downsizing in Schenectady, General Electric wasn\u2019t moving facilities to Mexico or China, though that happened later. They moved manufacturing facilities south, where wages were lower and unions less powerful. \u201cThey used to have a motor department there,\u201d Witkowski explained. \u201cThey moved somewhere south, non-union shops, lower wages, that was the first big move.\u201d<br></p> <p>But in a vertically integrated manufacturing facility like General Electric used to be, moving one piece of production has downstream effects. \u201cPart of that motor division, they had a place where they made their own wire,\u201d said Witkowski. \u201cThousands of jobs around the clock, making wire for all these motors. So when the motor department went out, the wire mills went out, too.\u201d</p> <p>Under the union contracts of the time, those blue-collar workers who lost their jobs but had seniority at the company could \u201cbump\u201d less senior workers to stay at GE. \u201cLet\u2019s say you were a lathe operator,\u201d explained Witkowski. \u201cWell, then you could bump a lathe operator somewhere else in the plant, as long as you had more seniority than them. And then that person might have to bump a lower-paying job, maybe a sweeper. Eventually, somebody had to go out on the street.\u201d</p> <p>Or, as Chapadeau put it, \u201cUntil, eventually, there was nobody left for you to bump, <em>you</em> went out of the street.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven though people could bump, the whole population was getting smaller and smaller and smaller,\u201d explained Witkowski. \u201cIf there was less machinists, then they needed less electricians, less carpenters, less steelworkers, less painters, less maintenance people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know a lot of people that got laid off that I worked with, maybe they went somewhere to a machine tool company in Albany and worked as electricians,\u201d added Witkowski. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t make the kind of money they made at GE. They didn\u2019t have the benefits.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the 80s, we got into [laying off] people with 12, 13 years\u201d of service, Chapadeau added. \u201cFirst time I got laid off was 85, came back in 86. Then got laid off in 87, came back in 90.\u201d By then, he had enough seniority to last until he retired in 2015. </p> <p>Like Chapadeau, those people who did find work almost always responded to a recall notice, if they got one, because the money and benefits were better at GE \u2013 even if they knew they might get laid off again.<br></p> <p>\u201cI kind of described it like a rollercoaster ride,\u201d Witkowski added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f275a37162495b74f9eeaea44e674d6cf2c78a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f275a37162495b74f9eeaea44e674d6cf2c78a0/0_361_3462_2078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Production Line12th August 1968: Mechanics putting the finishing touches to six T58 turboshaft engines at the General Electric Company at Schenectady, New York.

There were businesses \u2013 like Sears Roebuck, the uniform company Rudnicks and little lunch places \u2013 that stood just outside GE\u2019s gates on Erie Boulevard to cater to white- and blue-collar workers on their lunch breaks. </p> <p>\u201cThey would run buses from inside the plant and drop you off down in front of Proctors, mainly for the secretaries, who had an hour. They\u2019d go to lunch, they\u2019d go shopping. Thousands of \u2019em,\u201d Witkowski explained. \u201cAnd a lot of people would just walk up Erie Boulevard, the people that had an hour for lunch, and just go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEverybody was out spending money on their lunch hour. And all those stores were thriving,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd then when they laid everybody off, well, you know what happened with downtown Schenectady\u201d he said. </p> <p>Little businesses closed, empty storefronts abounded, nothing seemed to be able to stay in business.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you drive by the GE and look out and see green and a running track or a soccer field, that\u2019s where there was buildings, that\u2019s where there was jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cAll those people. Everybody buying homes, buying cars. Even in Schenectady, there was a lot of car dealerships, you would drive up State Street, there was car dealerships. That\u2019s all gone, too.\u201d</p> <p>The ripples didn\u2019t stop there. Though Phillips, the engineer, wasn\u2019t directly affected by the rounds of layoffs and downsizing, he\u2019s got plenty of examples of the impact on his life as well.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe go to First United Methodist in Schenectady,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen GE was booming, church was full of people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur church will seat about 600, but on a typical Sunday we typically have less than 100,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s been a fact of 37-some-thousand people don\u2019t work here any more. And the people that do work here, not as many of them live downtown, they live in the suburbs.\u201d</p> <p>Schenectady County\u2019s population peaked in 1970; by 1980, it had dropped down to below 1960 levels and kept going down until 2000. As the population has <a href=\"https://pad.human.cornell.edu/profiles/Schenectady.pdf\">begun to grow again</a>, so has median income \u2026 and the number of people living below the poverty line. </p> <p>Like Terry Phillips\u2019s daughters, Bernie Witkowski\u2019s son and Don Chapadeau\u2019s kids left the area for college and most didn\u2019t come back. Most of their high school classmates who stayed in the area aren\u2019t employed by GE \u2013 but, then, only a handful of people, compared with the early 70s, are employed by GE at all. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4de6f026a2e93a121d420f1fabe66c57eeeaaba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4de6f026a2e93a121d420f1fabe66c57eeeaaba/0_551_4230_2539/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Obama toured GE\u2019s Schenectady plant with CEO Jeffrey Immelt in 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama toured GE\u2019s Schenectady plant with its CEO, Jeffrey Immelt, in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J.

Meanwhile, Washington hawks think that Obama, who has bombed seven countries, hasn\u2019t been aggressive enough. They\u2019re looking forward to a more assertive Clinton foreign policy. But Trump proved that you can get the Republican nomination by opposing the Iraq war and global interventionism, and that may lead to more resistance to endless war and more congressional constraints on presidential war powers.</p> <h2>Supreme court: <a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/about/staff/m/john-malcolm\">John Malcolm</a></h2> <p><em>Director, Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the Heritage Foundation</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"787ee3be60fbab8780b706b758d990f728b39e2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/787ee3be60fbab8780b706b758d990f728b39e2d/0_0_500_700/357.jpg\" alt=\"John Malcolm.\" width=\"357\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Malcolm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hills</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is no question that the future of the supreme court is on the ballot.

Median incomes have gone up and the poverty rate is falling. People are not wrong that there has been a long period of economic stagnation and increasing inequality, but we seem to be turning a corner. This is exactly the wrong time to adopt policies that are going to throw the economy into a tailspin.</p> <p>Threatening to shut down trade negotiations or promising to renegotiate settled trade agreements, for example the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), makes no sense if the imperative is to build on the gathering momentum of the US economy. The case for the TPP has as much to do with America\u2019s political influence and interest in Asia as it does with economics. Abandoning the TPP would be a huge gift to China. The other Asian countries will make accommodations to China, and America\u2019s influence will plummet.</p> <p>That is the situation Hillary Clinton will inherit if she wins. The question, then, is how to reconcile the need to tap into those growing Asian markets with her shift on trade during the campaign.</p> <h2>Middle East: <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/people/anthony-h-cordesman\">Anthony Cordesman</a></h2> <p><em>Arleigh Burke chair in strategy, Center for Strategic and International Studies</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6361bbf82c998f93f92b4509093356aa58b95cdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6361bbf82c998f93f92b4509093356aa58b95cdf/61_0_403_504/400.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Cordesman.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Cordesman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Center for Strategic &amp; International\u200b Studies</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next administration will confront serious security challenges across the Middle East. Some are obvious and longstanding: the rise of Islamic State, the impact of the US invasion of Iraq, the fighting and instability in Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen.</p> <p>It is also true that by the time the next president takes office, the game will probably have a changed. If Isis is defeated in Iraq, which it may well be by the time the next administration is in place, that immediately means he or she will have to decide how to secure Iraq and how to proceed in Syria. </p> <p>Isis has never been the only \u2013 or even the dominant \u2013 terrorist threat in the region. In 2015, estimates indicate that Isis accounted for about 20% of the terrorist incidents in the region. So when Isis is defeated as a proto-state, we will have to consider new threats. Do people migrate to other extremist movements? Do we see al-Qaida, which has made serious gains in Yemen and has a strong affiliate in Syria, grow? Does this expose new sectarian, ethnic or tribal tensions?</p> <p>There is a need to restructure US-Arab cooperation, with a consideration toward creating lasting civil stability. The Arab spring showed how civil forces \u2013 poor governance, lagging economic development, high youth unemployment \u2013 exacerbated regional upheaval and violence.

This shift has been under way for some time but will be more marked in the coming years.</p> <p>The No 1 challenge a President Trump or a President Clinton will face is Russia. Mr Trump thinks he can get a \u201cdeal\u201d but there is reason to believe that will prove far more challenging that he anticipates, and in the process he could upend a lot of relationships with US allies.</p> <p>For Secretary Clinton, given the series of hacks on the Democratic party and her campaign, she will probably take a very different position. The question then is: how much tougher will she get and how specifically she will engage with Russia? This will probably result in much more of an emphasis on countering disinformation and lead to much more intelligence gathering in collaboration with Europeans.</p> <p>Another major challenge for the US will be to get Europe to focus on something other than its own internal affairs: Brexit, slow economic growth and domestic politics, which have taken a sharp turn to the right.</p> <p>Next year, the Netherlands, France and Germany hold elections. If Mr Trump is elected, I believe there is more of a chance that rightwing parties will come to power. In a sense, his election gives permission to these movements to become more anti-American, creating a political dynamic in Europe that is more rightwing and more hostile to the US.</p> <p>Brexit has put the US in a position of trying to remain friends with both parties in a messy divorce. The US will have to build new relationships with Europe and with the UK, and this will take effort.</p> <h2>Women\u2019s healthcare: Heather Boonstra</h2> <p><em>Director of public policy, Guttmacher Institute</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"96043a37130998bd79d1037b43e94eefa770cd2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96043a37130998bd79d1037b43e94eefa770cd2c/0_0_288_360/288.jpg\" alt=\"Heather Boonstra\" width=\"288\" height=\"360\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heather Boonstra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guttmacher Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abortion has been legal throughout the US for more than 40 years, but it remains one of the country\u2019s hottest political flashpoints.

The Democratic platform supports a woman\u2019s ability to obtain an abortion \u201cregardless of where she lives, how much money she makes, or how she is insured\u201d.</p> <p>In addition to abortion, access to contraceptive services and reproductive healthcare generally is also at stake. The Republicans have called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and have also targeted the Title X national family planning program and Planned Parenthood health clinics. Hillary Clinton is a lifelong champion for the reproductive health and rights of women. We should recall that she coined a now famous phrase \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d.</p> <h2>Poverty: Caroline Ratcliffe</h2> <p><em>Senior fellow and economist, Center on Labor, Human Services and Population at the Urban Institute</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7d68254cee48d7b29e69f306c69e746e854bdfde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d68254cee48d7b29e69f306c69e746e854bdfde/18_0_264_330/264.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Ratcliffe\" width=\"264\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline Ratcliffe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Urban Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Almost 14% of all Americans, and nearly 20% of American children, are poor. <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/low-income-working-families/projects/children-persistent-poverty\">Child poverty can have lifelong consequences</a> for health, education, earnings and more. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.urban.org/urban-wire/seven-things-you-should-know-about-childhood-poverty\">Addressing the needs of poor young children and their parents is key</a>.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposal <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/06/14/fact-sheet-universal-preschool/\">to double the investment in Early Head Start</a> would expand the reach of educational and other supports for younger children and their families, such as home-visiting programs for new mothers.

Before October\u2019s European council meeting in Brussels, German government officials vehemently denied that security cooperation would form part of the discussions at the summit.</p> <p>But the EU\u2019s united front has been undermined by some inconvenient timetabling. On 1 May 2017, a month after the deadline May has given herself for triggering article 50, the European Union will adopt a regulation that expands the role of the European parliament and national EU legislatures in supervising Europol\u2019s operations.</p> <p>On Friday, May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/brexit-timetable-article-50-ruling-theresa-may-jean-claude-juncker-eu\">told EU officials</a> that she would stick to her deadline in spite of the high court\u2019s decision that her government must get parliamentary approval to trigger article 50. Some MPs have suggested the need to draft new legislation may further squeeze the planned timetable.</p> <p>The UK is not part of the border-free Schengen zone and has an opt-in into Europol, which will automatically expire as soon as the new rules come into effect. By dropping out of Europol, the UK would automatically be shut out of a number of other agencies and intelligence cooperation programmes, such as the Schengen-wide information system SIS II.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesman pointed to recent comments made by Brandon Lewis, the policing minister, who said no decision had yet been taken on Europol. \u201cThe decision on whether we opt into the further Europol regulations will be announced to parliament shortly. We will take that decision very soon; we are giving good consideration to where we are on that and will make an announcement to parliament in due course,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Last week Lewis <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-has-decided-to-opt-into-eu-crime-fighting-measures-risking-anger-of-brexit-tory-mps-a7391666.html\">confirmed in a letter</a> that the UK would press ahead with an opt-in to the Pr\u00fcm convention, an EU-wide system for sharing DNA samples, fingerprints and vehicle registration.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.andrej-hunko.de/start/download/doc_download/864-gutachten-des-wissenschaftlichen-dienstes-im-bundestag-zu-konsequenzen-des-brexit-fuer-den-bereich-inneres-justiz\">A report</a> (pdf) by the German parliament\u2019s academic service recently raised alarm over the hole that Brexit could leave in Europe\u2019s security network, and pointed out that the UK would no longer have direct access to Europol\u2019s databases.</p> <p>Europol, which is based in The Hague, started operations in 1999 and is funded through the EU budget. It has a British director, Rob Wainwright, and according to a spokesperson, 40% of its cases have a \u201cBritish dimension\u201d.</p> <p>German government officials told the Guardian that there was still hope in Berlin that as a former home secretary, May would appreciate the value of cooperating on counter-terrorism measures. In a private speech at Goldman Sachs before the EU referendum, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/exclusive-leaked-recording-shows-what-theresa-may-really-thinks-about-brexit?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">recently leaked to the Guardian</a>, May expressly argued that British security was best served by remaining in Europe.</p> <p>The German Left party MP Andrej Hunko, who submitted the query to the government, said that although the UK had been one of the main drivers behind Europol\u2019s engagement in covert intelligence networking, Britain opting out of the agency could potentially give rise to even more informal and less democratically accountable forms of information-sharing.</p> <p>\u201cAfter Brexit, the strengthening of informal structures such as the police working group on terrorism and the Club de Berne could become a major cause for concern\u201d, Hunko said. \u201cThese institutions don\u2019t form part of the European Union and are thus harder to control by either delegates in the European parliament or our national parliaments, with national governments remaining as secretive about such networks as they can.\u201d</p> <p>From the position of the German Left party, Hunko said, \u201cthe question of whether British police should remain part of Europol is therefore a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea\u201d.</p>",

Today was always likely to be a slog, and so it proved, first the Proteas slogging with bat in hand, pushing their already sizeable lead into gargantuan territory. The real question though was whether they had the artillery to take 10 Australian wickets with an attack shorn of Dale Steyn.</p> <p>Kagiso Rabada went a considerable way to answering that question, taking three top order wickets to place his side firmly in the driving seat. The fourth home victim was David Warner who was run out by Temba Bavuma in one of the most brilliant pieces of fielding you could ever witness. </p> <p>With Australia\u2019s long tail the end could arrive in a hurry tomorrow but with only Rabada looking capable of forcing breakthroughs, if he can be seen off, it could be a longer day in the sun than South Africa might prefer. </p> <p>We\u2019ll be back tomorrow to round off the action.

So there we have it, South Africa turning the screw on the hosts at lunch on day four, with Australia having had very little to shout about so far today. The question is now: when will Steve Smith and his team get a chance to chase down the Proteas\u2019 big total and enter the record books with the highest successful run chase in the history of Test cricket? The feeling is not quite yet, with no indication from Faf du Plessis that they\u2019re about to declare over a cucumber sandwich or two in the pavilion. </p> <p>Other questions to mull over while bellies are filling: should Maharaj and Philander re-emerge after the break, do the Proteas run the risk of leaving it too late to bowl out Australia with less than five sessions to go? The longer the South African innings goes on, might Australia be scared off going for victory? It may appear to be a one-way street to a South African victory, but some intrigue at least remains.</p> <p>Not sure if Adam mention this earlier, but in case he didn\u2019t, the highest successful run chase of all time came in 2003, when West Indies reached 418-7 to defeat Australia in St John\u2019s. Here are the next best:</p> <p>414-4 - South Africa beat Australia in Perth in 2008<br>406-4 - India beat West Indies in Port of Spain in 1976<br>404-3 - Australia beat England in Leeds in 1948<br>387-4 - India beat England in Chennai in 2008<br>382-3 - Pakistan beat Sri Lanka in Pallekele in 2015<br>369-6 - Australia beat Pakistan in Hobart in 1999</p> <p>Anyway, it\u2019d be great to get your thoughts on this match, and the second session in particular. Speak your brains on Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mike_hytner\">@mike_hytner</a>) on via email (<a href=\"mailto:mike.hytner@theguardian.com\">mike.hytner@theguardian.com</a>).

Then bat some more if the opportunity allowed. But in order to achieve another day of grind, they had to get in again. If the tourists lost four wickets in a hurry, Australia would have remained vaguely in this game. </p> <p>In full knowledge of this, de Kock and Philander went about slowly building up their base to begin, happy enough to see of maidens and let the Australian attack leaders come and go before capitalising either side of the drinks break. de Kock\u2019s hefty hitting included a glorious pair of straight sixes down the ground to welcome Lyon to the attack, summing up the nature of the challenge for the Australian tweaker. </p> <p>The South African \u2018keeper/bat was given out twice by the on-field umpires - once caught down legside off Hazlewood and lbw off Lyon - but both were overturned. Between times, Philander was dropped on the boundary by Hazlewood; a chance he should have taken at fine leg. </p> <p>De Kock finally went for 64 when miscuing a drive off Marsh, taken nicely by Voges in the gully, their stand 119. But this didn\u2019t stop Philander who continued playing his shots in the final half hour, collecting his fifth career half century along the way and making it to lunch unbeaten. </p> <p>For Australia, it got scrappier as the morning went on, illustrated by the 41 extras they have conceded so far in the innings, principally through wides and byes. Simply put, they\u2019ve spent. With a deficit of 506 and three wickets till to take, the only way out of this for the home side is batting for a very long time. After the punishing weekend they\u2019ve had so far, that would be as good as a win. </p> <p>Enough already. Mike Hytner will be here to take guard after the lunch break. Enjoy his company, as I have yours. Provided we\u2019re still going, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T04:44:37.173Z\">at 4.44am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581eb209e4b029b92ca45f4d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T04:32:27.286Z\">4.32am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>157th over: South Africa 508-7 (Philander 63, Maharaj 19) </strong>Nondescript end to a nondescript session.

Maharaj, I fancy, will give them a chance or two based on what we have seen of him on debut so far - he\u2019s a lasher.

It rather neatly sums up Australia\u2019s collective disposition coming into this fourth day at Perth. With the South African tourists 388 ahead with four wickets in hand, the theoretically possible is the realistically highly improbable for the hosts.</p> <p>But you need not despair, because we\u2019re back with the live over by over coverage for this fourth day here at the Waca Ground in Perth. I\u2019m Adam Collins, I\u2019ll be here on the tools for the first session before Mike Hytner takes over for the afternoon, and JP Howcroft the evening. A good morning (or afternoon, or evening, wherever you are in the world) to you all.</p> <p>I can report that it is a bit sweaty outside, but in contrast to yesterday, it is not forecast to get any hotter than it is at the moment, floating around the low-to-mid 20s. A fact the depleted South African pace attack (read, duo) would have enjoyed when checking their phones this morning.</p> <p>It was Dean Elgar and JP Duminy who did all they could to bury Australian hopes in this opening rubber yesterday afternoon. Batting for two entire sessions, the left-handers seldom gave a chance. As Aussie coach Darren Lehmann has said this morning, he is \u201cvery happy with the effort\u201d of his bowlers, and believes with a bit of luck they could have taken all the required wickets yesterday. It wasn\u2019t their failings, it was the supreme concentration of the visiting batsmen, Elgar finishing with 127 (from 314 balls, if you don\u2019t mind) and Duminy a delicious 141.</p> <p>Where\u2019s that leave us? Well, this is the very ground that 414 was chased down in during this corresponding fixture in 2008. Albeit from the other mob. That\u2019s the second highest successful chase in the history of Test cricket and they\u2019ve been at this caper for 140 years.</p> <p>Duminy was part of that memorable chase, and Dale Steyn the XI as well. His absence in the fourth innings here (and possibly the third if he doesn\u2019t bat) is hugely significant. It leads Lehmann to believe that his side can \u201cchase down anything.\u201d Of course, after losing 10-for-86 on Friday, that\u2019s a bit bold. But what\u2019s the alternative?</p> <p>Okay, we\u2019re about 15 minutes until go time, so grab a bottle of fanta and a bag of chicken twisties and ready yourself. We\u2019ve had three excellent days of Test cricket so far this week, let\u2019s hope it is a fourth.

Then one tutor suggested I play the nurse from <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> in Jamaican patois.

In 2012, I auditioned for her for <em>Julius Caesar</em> [when the play was originally performed]. That was different again. We saw it the way Phyllida sees it. In <em>The Tempest</em> I responded to the Shakespearean conversation in my own words, and Phyllida loved it. I\u2019ve learned more about Shakespeare than I ever imagined.</p> <p><strong>Had you always wanted to act?</strong><br>Yes, as a kid, but I didn\u2019t know how to get there.

I became a kind of advocate, especially for the younger women. It took away the tempest in my own heart, it gave me a purpose. Some young women would be released early and be back inside 10 days later. What\u2019s that about? Young women would be living in a car, with their boyfriends. I\u2019d tell them: \u201cYou may love him but if he loved you, he\u2019d want something better for you.\u201d A lot of them did change and normalise their lives.</p> <p><strong>How did it happen for you?</strong><br>I was a broken woman when I came out. I was depressed, my children didn\u2019t know who I was. One day, a friend told me about Clean Break. All I heard was: \u201cThey allow you to act.\u201d It was the best thing I ever did. It was the saving of my soul.</p> <p><strong><em>The Tempest</em> goes to New York for a month in January. Will you go too?</strong><br>The Donmar tried and failed to get me a visa [because of the drug conviction]. Around the same time, in December 2013, I had three cardiac arrests and no oxygen to the brain for 47 minutes. The artery to my heart was 99% blocked. The upside of me not getting a visa is that, if I\u2019d gone on the plane, the altitude would have put too much pressure on my already blocked artery. Since then, we\u2019ve tried endlessly to make a dream come true for me, but the US is giving me a real fight. Ten years on from my conviction, it\u2019s still refusing a visa.</p> <p><strong>Lessons so far in life?</strong><br>You only get what you work for. If I see a person who\u2019s wealthy, I think to myself: \u201cI don\u2019t know what you did to acquire that money, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d do what you did to get it, but if it\u2019s legit, anyone can get where you are.\u201d I can\u2019t forgive myself for putting my children through what they experienced, but each day they tell me how proud they are of me.</p> <p><strong>What role would you most like to play?</strong><br>I\u2019m so happy to try it all. I act as part of Clean Break in prisons. The women come to a performance to get out of their cells, but once I tell them my story, everything changes. They want to know there\u2019s life after prison. They want to learn about hope.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.donmarwarehouse.com/whats-on/donmar-warehouse/donmar-kings-cross/2016/shakespeare-trilogy#PGgo8iwlvi2zEEtz.97\">Shakespeare Trilogy is at the King\u2019s Cross theatre, London N1 until 17 December</a><br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The year is 1949 and a brave new world has just been born: Aneurin Bevan\u2019s newly formed NHS is opening its doors to patients, no matter their social class, and it is this moment in contemporary history that provides the backdrop for Linda Grant\u2019s hugely entertaining seventh novel, The Dark Circle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/05/my-writing-day-linda-grant\">Linda Grant: \u2018I can't write after lunch, in a public place, or when anyone is in the house'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is four years since the war and \u201ceverything is short, soap is short, joy is short, sex is short, and no one on the street is laughing so jokes must be short too\u201d. When East End Jewish boy Lenny Lynskey and his twin sister, Miriam, contract tuberculosis, the two 18-year-olds are swiftly dispatched to a sanatorium, the Gwendo, in the Kent countryside. Formerly a private hospital, the Gwendo\u2019s patients had traditionally been \u201cmiddle class or better\u201d but now \u201cnew arrivals were starting to turn up, types with bad table manners and no taste for the genteel facilities the Gwendo offered its languid inmates: bridge tournaments, flower arranging, golf for the fitter ones\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Despite its historical setting, Grant\u2019s novel is shot through with contemporary relevance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Gwendo is a social melting pot, in which people from across the class spectrum are trapped together with no chance of escape, allowing Grant a prism through which to view the social, political and cultural mores of the period. A diverse and engaging cast of characters populate the hospital: ineffectual medical director Dr Limb is infatuated with one of his patients; the matron makes no attempt to disguise her disdain for her working-class wards \u2013 \u201cit seemed to her there had been a sudden collapse of order while she was in another room\u201d; widowed art teacher Mrs Kitson is \u201centirely middle-aged now, thirty-four!\u201d and enjoys extracurricular sexual activity with the more healthy inmates.

With the arrival of American patient Arthur Pesky, the hierarchical obedience of the sanatorium is disrupted and the unlikely group of friends begins to challenge medical authority.</p> <p><em>The Dark Circle </em>is a fascinating portrayal of the authoritarianism inherent in postwar British healthcare. Some of the treatments are both brutal and unproved, yet there is a dictatorial assumption that doctors\u2019 orders should never be questioned.

  "<p>In the unlikely event that Alan Bennett, playwright and national treasure, and Chris Ware, comic artist extraordinaire, were to collaborate \u2013 I suppose there\u2019s still time \u2013 the result might turn out a bit like the winner of the 2016 <em>Observer</em>/Jonathan Cape/Comica graphic short story prize. <em>Colin&#xa0;Turnbull: A Tall Story</em>, the charming and rather plangent tale of a man who longs only to win Lancashire\u2019s Tallest Milkman competition, took its creator, Matthew Dooley, only two weeks to draw. But you\u2019d never know it. Look beyond its slightly surreal humour \u2013 it pokes fun at the silly, overblown language of sport \u2013 and you\u2019ll see that it also pays quiet tribute to the now rapidly diminishing army of men (and women) who continue, against the financial odds, to deliver a daily pint to doorsteps everywhere. Even as it makes the reader laugh, then, it has the quality of an elegy, which is perhaps why it won this year in spite of some exceptionally tough competition.</p> <p>Dooley, who works for the parliamentary education service at the Palace of Westminster, doesn\u2019t have a background in art: he studied classics at university, and laughs that it might be \u201cpushing it\u201d to suggest the friezes on classical Greek buildings can be seen as an early form of cartoon strip. Nevertheless, he has been trying to win the <em>Observer</em>/Cape/Comica competition for a while. This is, in fact, his fifth attempt. \u201cI drew incessantly as a child,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I read Asterix, Tintin and <em>2000AD</em>. But when I was about 15 or 16, I stopped. I didn\u2019t come back to comics or to drawing until my 20s when \u2013 I don\u2019t suppose this is an unusual story \u2013 I discovered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/aug/28/comics.politics\" title=\"\">Art Spiegelman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ng-interactive/2014/sep/13/-sp-chris-ware-the-last-saturday-graphic-novel\" title=\"\">Chris Ware</a>. After that, I started dabbling again, which was difficult at first because I was so out of practice. The first proper comic I ever drew was the first one I put in for in the <em>Observer</em> competition, which I\u2019ve entered four times before. But that worked for me: I need some kind of external pressure to get going.\u201d</p> <p>Is he thrilled to have won at last? \u201cOh, yes. I\u2019m pleased. But I\u2019m also very&#xa0;surprised.\u201d</p> <p>His idea wasn\u2019t a new one. \u201cYears ago, me and my friend, Chris, were knocking about ideas for sketches, and I had one for a milkman who was obsessed with being tall. I found it in an old notebook, and revived it: the combination of the mundane and the obsessive seemed like it would be just right for a comic. I set it in Lancashire, in a place like the one I grew up in: Ormskirk, which was quite bland and suburban\u2026 extraordinarily normal, I suppose you\u2019d say. I\u2019m a sports obsessive. I tend to live vicariously through the achievements of various sports people. But I do see that sport is inherently ridiculous, too.\u201d</p> <p>What about his drawings? The influence of Chris Ware seems obvious. \u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t dispute that, except my hands must be a lot more wiggly than his. I really like Chris Ware, but I\u2019m not deliberately trying to be like him. I think I\u2019m still looking for my own style. Finding one that\u2019s completely my own is a work in progress.\u201d Dooley hopes that winning the competition will open doors for him, though he has already begun contributing to small-press anthologies. \u201cI\u2019d love to have a go at something longer, and I\u2019m very aware of past winners like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/06/observer-graphic-short-story-prize-greenberg\" title=\"\">Isabel Greenberg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/07/observer-graphic-prize-stephen-collins\" title=\"\">Stephen Collins</a> [both bagged publishing deals with Jonathan Cape after winning], who are truly, truly brilliant.\u201d He also, of course, takes home \u00a31,000.</p> <p>This is the ninth year of the prize and the standard was as high as ever; among the stories\u2019 themes were the housing crisis and mass tourism on Mount Everest. The judges \u2013 our regular panel was joined this time by the cartoonist Steve Bell, and the novelist Sebastian Faulks \u2013 felt that half a dozen entries could ultimately have gone on to win, and certainly to be a runner-up. In the end, though, we gave the second prize to <em>Of Ice and Men</em>, a multilayered tale of global warming that comes with a ghastly (and topical) twist \u2013 the work of \u201cDoulos Nezblanc\u201d, better known as David Ross, a Zimbabwean-born former lawyer who now works in a London cinema. Exquisitely beautiful and thought-provoking, too, its final frame provoked explosive guffaws all around the judging table.</p> <p><em>An exhibition of the stories shortlisted for this year\u2019s competition can be seen at </em><a href=\"http://www.orbitalcomics.com/graphic-short-story-prize-competition-exhibition-and-winner-announcement/\" title=\"\"><em>Orbital Comics</em></a><em>, 8 Great Newport Street, London WC2, until 17 November </em></p>",

He\u2019s still trying to win this fight, not simply exit the ring upright like so many previous Pacquiao opponents at this stage. Yet Pacquiao continues to frustrate Vargas and make him miss and he wins another round. Crucially, the Nevada State Athletic Commission has ruled the cut over Vargas\u2019 eye was caused by a punch.

He barrels forward and throws a series of punches. None seem to connect with substance but it\u2019s better than waiting for Pacquiao to bring the action. Pacquiao landing punches here and there but Vargas looking more confidence and returning when he can. The closest round yet and Vargas has really managed to keep it on even terms, just enough to nick it.<br></p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Vargas 10-9 Pacquiao (Vargas 45-49 Pacquiao)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581eb1fbe4b029b92ca45f4c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T04:34:06.588Z\">4.34am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round 4</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Vargas just looks slower and he\u2019s expended a lot of energy simply keeping Pacquiao at bay, so it\u2019s a problem that won\u2019t resolve itself. He lands a nice right early on but continues to miss wildly with the left hook. The constant in-and-out, herky-jerky movement of the challenger is just too much to keep up with. Another good right by Vargas near the bell. That was his best round but I\u2019ve still got to tip it to Pacquiao.<br></p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 35-40 Pacquiao)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581eb19ae4b07ceadb3a2e16\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T04:29:39.524Z\">4.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round 3</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Vargas rattled here and Pacquiao starts to open with combinations. A flurry of punches moves Vargas back but he stays on his feet. Oh and Manny is really letting his hands go now: punches in bunches from all angles. Now the crowd is chanting: Man-ny! Man-ny! Pacquiao warned for a low blow. Vargas connects with a stinging shot near the end of the round, perhaps his best shot of the fight, but it\u2019s not enough to take the third. Pacquiao sure doesn\u2019t look like the fighter who is 10 years older.<br></p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 26-30 Pacquiao)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581eb07ce4b0d073c27d1e86\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T04:24:39.390Z\">4.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round 2</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Vargas opening up more here with a few tenatative combinations but failing to connect with anything substantive. Pacquiao bobbing and weaving, looking for an opening and keeping Vargas on the back foot simply with feints.

But he looked in fine form against the outstanding Bradley, scoring two knockdowns, and is widely expected to prevail here tonight. The southpaw from Sarangani province was installed as a -850 favorite while Vargas opened as a +625 underdog. Those odds have shortened slightly as the fight has drawn closer, but there\u2019s no doubt that Pacquiao will enter the ring a firm favorite tonight in Las Vegas.</p> <p>Plenty more to come.

  "<p>Out walking, you are confronted by a long column of trees approaching across a bare winter landscape. You stop, and it seems as if they stop too. Stationed before them \u2013 the field marshal commanding his troops \u2013 stands a stone pillar topped with a pale sphere. And this sphere has a peculiarly exact echo in the white moon hanging beside it in the sky: English pastoral geometry.</p> <p><em>Pillar and Moon</em> is not just one of Paul Nash\u2019s greatest works, it encapsulates the painter\u2019s gift for mood, mystery and strange alignment. Every element of the scene is independently familiar \u2013 the parade of vertical trunks, the low-hanging moon, the architectural remnant of some aristocratic parkland \u2013 but all are made extraordinary and oneiric. The positioning of the two discs may be significant, or meaningless, but it holds the mind in wonder. The atmosphere feels dazed and convalescent.</p> <p>Nash died of heart failure, brought on by chronic asthma, in a Bournemouth suburb in 1946. He was 57, and had narrowly escaped gassing and death more than once in the first world war. He lost consciousness several times during his curtailed life, and his bleached and dreamy landscapes seem to hold on to the light as if it might fade. And landscape is where everything happens in Nash\u2019s art: outdoors is his internal stage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e452311240ee4c981ad87761fac0b9bcc0875c0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e452311240ee4c981ad87761fac0b9bcc0875c0f/0_0_2953_3496/845.jpg\" alt=\"The Cherry Orchard, 1917 by Paul Nash.\" width=\"845\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cherry Orchard, 1917 by Paul Nash.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>The Cherry Orchard</em>, beautifully positioned at the entrance to <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/paul-nash\">this enormous show</a> \u2013 the first full-stretch survey in a generation \u2013 sets the tone from the start. An array of trunks casts diagonal shadows on the landscape, which is divided again by wire fencing as the sky is crisscrossed by stark branches. These are the bare ruin\u2019d choirs of Shakespeare, and yet the watercolour was made in leafy July. Nash was temporarily home from the trenches in 1917. His image is distanced from life, while partaking of it: he sees the ribs, bones and ghosts in the landscape.</p> <p>Trees march by night, hugger-mugger in the darkness. Huddled together, they watch dawn break over the horizon. Their trunks lie felled, vast as the ancient stones of Wiltshire, or protrude upright, shattered and amputated, from the black mud of Ypres. They are bodies, and sometimes corpses, yet never people.</p> <p>It was noted at the Slade \u2013 where Nash studied in the diverse generation that included Ben Nicholson, Wyndham Lewis and Stanley Spencer \u2013 that the human figure would never be his forte. People do appear in his art, surprisingly often, but always as wraiths or surrogates. Far more haunting are nature\u2019s figures, such as the two tiny trees holding still at the centre of <em>The Pyramids in the Sea</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"010762b08606fd08c2f6265d0e120ae957582de0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/010762b08606fd08c2f6265d0e120ae957582de0/0_0_2953_3259/906.jpg\" alt=\"The Pyramids in the Sea, 1912.\" width=\"906\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Pyramids in the Sea, 1912.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This irreducibly strange vision shows roiling seas by night, two pyramids dropped among them, and sand dunes metamorphosing into waves. It is a vision from the land of counterpane, made when Nash was scarcely 23. Yet it contains the future like a kernel \u2013 the intermingling of land and sea, the premonition of surrealism, <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Samuel_Palmer_-_The_Harvest_Moon_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\">the Samuel Palmer moon</a> (long before Palmer was discovered in the 1920s) of Nash\u2019s English nocturnes. Above all the bell-shaped waves that rise and fall across the picture, and all through the rest of his work.</p> <p>You see these in his devastating masterpiece <em>We Are Making a New World</em> (1918), where the spiked rays of the sun radiate like searchlights above a sea of tragic humps \u2013 the churned and deadly trenches. And it is there in weird vernal hillscapes painted during the second world war. Cumulus mounts over the Channel in swelling curves and descends in matching formations with the dark plumes of crashing aeroplanes.</p> <p>Nash is routinely described as Britain\u2019s foremost surrealist. But his consciously surreal paintings are as mediocre as his effortful still lifes. It is a pity Tate Britain has given quite so much space to both, but the curators are intent on dutiful chronology and dust-dry modernist history. Nash\u2019s life is hardly mentioned in the captions, as if he didn\u2019t have one, and a whole room is devoted to his fellow artists in the Unit One group \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/barbara-hepworth\">Hepworth</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/henry-moore\">Moore</a>, the Edwards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/edward-burra\">Burra</a> and Wadsworth \u2013 when their work is available in galleries upstairs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b734732633d7e450266e2bcf9e891417c6fa2523\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b734732633d7e450266e2bcf9e891417c6fa2523/0_0_2953_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"We Are Making a New World, 1918.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"780\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">We Are Making a New World, 1918.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imperial War Museum, London \u00a9 Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is true that Nash\u2019s paintings sometimes have the period look \u2013 the chalky surface, the mildly sardonic, gas-fire plangency \u2013 of London painting in the 1920s. It is also true that for a brief period he painted receding tunnels and metaphysical objects in the obvious shadow of <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/giorgio-de-chirico-902\">De Chirico</a>. But soon Nash is off on his own again with strange incidents on the Downs and startling shorelines at Dymchurch in Kent, where he rented a cottage after a nervous breakdown.</p> <p>Here the cold waves clatter like wrecked fuselage or turn into solid planes of ice, stretching into the darkness beneath a grey moon. In that marvellous painting <em>The Shore</em>, made in 1923, the postwar defences lie face-down, as it seems, like a vast plane crashed upon the beach. Later, in the second world war, Nash draws the bones of aircraft lying exposed in the earth, or dangling from wires, or surfacing out of seas of corn. To come upon them in the landscape must have been as surprising as this \u2013 like chancing on the skeleton of a dinosaur.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"28bd0b725976db59f41944c813fbfa1c1fa8d86a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28bd0b725976db59f41944c813fbfa1c1fa8d86a/0_0_3534_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Totes Meer (Dead Sea), 1940-1.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Totes Meer (Dead Sea), 1940-1.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And everything Nash paints has that curious timelessness. The aeroplanes in his most famous masterpiece, <em>Totes Meer</em> <em>(Dead Sea)</em>, could almost be old ships, but for the markings, or frozen waves, but for a solitary wheel. They pack the painting like the icebergs of Scott\u2019s doomed expedition to Antarctica, and yet they seem even older, appearing beneath the flight of an owl and a crescent moon. The picture was painted in 1940-1, but it could be set in a nuclear winter.</p> <p>Nash was a writer as well as a painter, and he left many piercing statements about his work. \u201cThere are places,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhose relationship of parts creates a mystery, an enchantment, which cannot be analysed.\u201d This is what his own paintings imagine. In the quiet of the studio, he turned his journey through the English landscape into new and mysterious visions that are so close to reality \u2013 the sun appearing at the same time as the moon, a crown of trees suddenly rising out of winter\u2019s tilled earth \u2013 as to carry the enchantment of which he writes. And then, with some inexplicable switch of atmosphere, alignment and elements, he makes this world even stranger.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/paul-nash\">Paul Nash is at Tate Britain, London until 5 March 2017</a><br></li> </ul>",

Hansen-L\u00f8ve\u2019s voice, however, is extraordinary in its democratic compassion and detail-fixated honesty. She has made a life study in which everything and nothing that happens is remarkable and surprising: raucous humour is found where there should be none, while sudden heartbreak sneaks up out of nowhere. It\u2019s evidently the fruit of a notably free collaboration with Huppert. The actress\u2019s signature spiky intelligence permeates the film, yet she has absorbed her director\u2019s crepe-paper tenderness and vulnerability.

Powell\u2019s idea of England \u2013 \u201cnot so much a place as a grief\u201d \u2013 is vividly evoked in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/apr/18/roxana-silbert-director\">Roxana Silbert</a>\u2019s production: in the sound of vanishing lapwings, in lines of AE Housman, and in Ti Green\u2019s dapple-shaded woodland set. All this wistfulness \u2013 alongside all that harshness. This is the springboard for questions about what gives anyone a sense of identity. Is it really to do with place? What happens when we begin to lose our minds? A fascinating hinterland is opened, but the central question slips out of focus.</p> <p>A crowd of different witnesses circle around Powell. A white woman \u2013 mentioned in the speech \u2013 who said she was yelled at and spat at by black children in her street. Two Pakistani men trying to establish careers and families in England. A white Quaker friend of Powell\u2019s who breaks with him after the speech. And, most crucially, the daughter of a Barbadian woman whose mother ignored her because her skin was insufficiently light, who confronts the former politician. All these characters raise interesting points; none are given more than a few brushstrokes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/31/enoch-powell-rivers-of-blood-play-what-shadows-ian-mcdiarmid\">Back to the rivers of blood: Enoch Powell returns to a divided Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Powell, though, is fully embodied. I don\u2019t think any actor could become him more convincingly than Ian McDiarmid. He gets the obvious notes: the thudding emphasis, the nasal delivery. Adopting the stoop of a taller man, he looks almost uncannily similar. More important, he suggests real complexity: adamantine crispness, political ambition and a touch of terror.</p> <p>Two marvellous unexpected speeches ring completely true. It is said that Powell hated getting his head wet; that he hated having his hair washed (why wasn\u2019t he, as an adult, washing it himself?). Later, he describes himself as having been both a storm and a man in that storm. McDiarmid\u2019s particularly complicated, crackling, layer-shifting voice is essential here: it does not plead for sympathy; it never merely orates. I only think his Parkinsonian gait is not quite right: it needs more shuffle.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/whats-on/what-shadows.html\">At Birmingham Rep until 12 November</a><br></li> </ul>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJgRbDye60\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YPJgRbDye60?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJgRbDye60\">The making of What Shadows.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

Santi said he would worry about M5S\u2019s response to economic challenges if they came into power, particularly since they seem to oppose any public intervention when it comes to saving troubled banks, and that their anti-austerity policies would put Italy on a collision course with the European commission.</p> <p>\u201cI think the Five Star movement didn\u2019t come out of nowhere.

  "<p>Alicia Keys has taken over Times Square, bringing five blocks of one of the busiest areas of the western world to its knees. Her \u201csecret\u201d gig tonight is not so secret. She\u2019ll commandeer the epic digital billboards and her face \u2013 lightly freckled and without makeup, as is her way these days \u2013 will flash all over American Eagle Outfitters.</p> <p>Times Square is Keys\u2019s back yard. She was born in Hell\u2019s Kitchen in 1981 and grew up in a one-bedroom apartment on 43rd Street between 9th and 10th Avenue. Her teenage years coincided with the tenure of Mayor Rudy Giuliani: the street is now quietly gentrified, and features the Manhattan Plaza Health Club.</p> <p>She has booked the entire 57th floor of the W hotel to dress for the gig, rest, and do this interview in promotion of <a href=\"http://www.aliciakeys.com/alicia-announces-new-album-and-debuts-new-single/\"><em>Here</em></a>, her first album in four years. Her complicated management system functions like an onion. There is an outer layer of nervy young people glued to Samsungs, a middle layer of big characters in bomber jackets who emerge before show time and hand out laminates, and an inner layer \u2013 Key\u2019s confidants and partners in her company, AK Worldwide: longtime manager and co-writer Erika Rose (headscarf and curly haired child in sling), and DJ Walton \u2013 who is, among many things, a vocal coach and boxing coach with two full sleeves of tattoos.</p> <p>The machinery around the star exists as a shock absorber, and Alicia\u2019s suite is almost temple-like in its serenity. Four shadowy figures sit on high-backed chairs, like guests at a strange, gloomy dinner party. Two cameramen swoop around the room, filming the proceedings \u2013 everyone from Beyonc\u00e9 to Janelle Mon\u00e1e has their own personal film team these days, capturing your interview for their \u201cpersonal archive\u201d, or their legal department.</p> <p>In the corner is a girl in a headscarf and jeans who looks so unassuming I think it\u2019s another assistant. Alicia Keys moves to the sofa in her socks, pulls her knees up, and begins talking in her soft, low, boyish voice.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>New York wasn\u2019t like a\u00a0beauty pageant, it was a hard, grimy place, and you had to dress accordingly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cTimes Square was dark \u2013 gee, it was dismal,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the 80s, when I was a little girl, this whole Midtown area was a different world. These are the streets that I walked, and learned my lessons on, and heard the music, and witnessed disenfranchised people, and people who just had dreams and hopes. Every pimp, every prostitute, every drug dealer, every Broadway dreamer wishing they could be a writer, or a musician, or an actor.\u201d</p> <p>Her white, Italian-Irish mother, Terria Augello (now Joseph), raised her alone, working as a legal assistant at the Chadbourne and Parke law firm at the Rockefeller Center from the year before she was born until 2001, when her daughter\u2019s debut album, <em>Songs in A Minor</em>, was released (it went on to sell 12m copies). Mum had attended NYU\u2019s School of the Arts and worked on and off as an actor. She started her daughter young: at four, Alicia got a part in <em>The Cosby Show</em>, as one of Rudy Huxtable\u2019s sleepover guests, and can be seen, small and giggling, riding Bill\u2019s leg like a bucking bronco.</p> <p>At 12, in 1993, she attended the newly created, publicly funded Professional Performing Arts School, 10 minutes walk from home and just off Broadway. Claire Danes and Britney Spears were pupils at one time. She was tutored by \u201cMiss Aziza\u2026\u201d she says wistfully. <a href=\"http://www.azizamiller.com/\">Aziza Miller</a> \u2013 \u201cOne of the most phenomenal women jazz instructors ever to be born. She was a pianist, an arranger, a producer, a composer, and she had so much vocal prowess. She was badass. And I know for a fact that she influenced a large part of what I became.\u201d</p> <p>The school kept her off the streets. \u201cYou walked out the door, you had to be ready to protect yourself,\u201d she says. \u201cBe covered up, just get to where you were going. I couldn\u2019t wear skirts, I couldn\u2019t wear heels. On the other hand, it was kind of the area where whoever didn\u2019t belong anywhere else could come, and belong.\u201d</p> <p>From mean streets to stage school to the big time, all by the age of 20, it was the American dream. When Keys released her first single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Urdlvw0SSEc\">Fallin\u2019</a>, in 2001 she already had a certain kind of pedigree. She\u2019d been taken on by Clive Davis, who\u2019d signed Janis Joplin and mentored Whitney Houston. Her songs, filled with jazz chords and tinkling Moonlight Sonata-style intros, appealed to a mature audience as well as a young one; another big hit, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8Hr50Ckwk\">If I Ain\u2019t Got You</a>, sounds like a thumping Motown classic now.

Even her new album <em>Here</em> \u2013 full of ice-cool songs celebrating life\u2019s confusions and compromises \u2013 bears a closer relationship to neo-soul than the songwriting teams of Beyonc\u00e9 or Rihanna.</p> <p>She\u2019s already had one comeback \u2013 2010\u2019s <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/3xkxcbnc7G3XYuZt6eUnI5\"><em>Empire State of Mind</em></a>, with her friend Jay Z, is the biggest New York song since Sinatra\u2019s. And she has remained, quietly, part of the hip-hop elite: she\u2019s known Beyonc\u00e9 since they were 16, and was one of the first artists to sign to Tidal; she\u2019s struck up sponsorship deals with everyone from BlackBerry to American Express, and has a formidable philanthropy career. Then there\u2019s the politics: she performed between Bill and Hillary Clinton at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/jul/26/democratic-convention-day-two-clinton-nominee-sanders\">Philadelphia\u2019s Democratic National Convention in July</a>. Which was a difficult day all round, apparently.</p> <p>\u201cReally, it was pretty emotional,\u201d she says. \u201cBernie was coming up to support Hillary at that time, and there was this real disappointed energy \u2013 because Bernie is so beloved, and he has such powerful thoughts and ideas that really resonate with people. There was this energy to make sure that there wasn\u2019t a huge divide within the party, because that would have been devastating. I remember just wanting to relay that.\u201d</p> <p>She says she sees in Clinton the possibility for \u201chow powerful women can be\u201d, then adds, \u201cIt\u2019s emotional for me as a black woman, wanting to make sure that all the issues are addressed in America when it comes to race, when it comes to black people \u2013 wanting to make sure that message isn\u2019t lost. And that it is continuously on all our agendas \u2013 particularly Hillary\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>Is she confident (we are talking four weeks ahead of the election) about the outcome?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s no end to what the family dynamic can look like, as long as it is filled with love</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI just refuse to believe that anything else is going to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I also know it\u2019s only going to happen if we\u2019re getting out and registering to vote. We have hope, we have potential; that I do believe in.\u201d</p> <p>In 2008, Keys <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/15/aliciakeys.urban\">told <em>Blender</em> magazine</a> she thought the Black Panther movement would have gone global if they\u2019d had the platform musicians have today. She might have to start something herself, she mused at the time \u2013 then Black Lives Matter came along and she didn\u2019t have to. Tidal donated $1.5m this year, on what would have been Trayvon Martin\u2019s 21st birthday. In July, Keys\u2019s charitable foundation, <a href=\"http://weareheremovement.com/\">We Are Here,</a> put together a protest film \u2013<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_VaNhI4CLo\"> \u201c23 Ways You Could Be Killed If You Are Black in America\u201d</a> \u2013 which featured Rihanna and Pharrell Williams.

Artists reach people at their heart; it\u2019s the only time we meet in one place and put our differences aside. When you\u2019re in a forum listening to music, all you feel in that moment is love and the understanding.\u201d</p> <p>Keys has known her husband, the producer <a href=\"http://www.swizzworld.com/\">Swizz Beatz</a> (Kasseem Dean), since she was about 16, though they took years to get together. Kanye West once called Dean, 38, the best rap producer of all time. His more unusual accolades include global ambassador for New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, and a place at Harvard Business School. Dean already had three children when he married Keys in 2010. His first son, Prince Nasir, with Nicole Levy, is 16. There\u2019s another, Kasseem, with Harlem songwriter Mashonda Tifrere, singer of the song <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/30612707\">No Panties</a>. And a girl, Nicole, by Jahna Sebastian, whose website claims she helped bring grime to Russia.</p> <p>Keys faced her share of scandal with the relationship, and covers it in the new single B<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWACsH1f2So\">lended Family (What You Do for Love)</a>, which includes a direct address to her stepchildren: \u201cI know it started with a little drama/ I hate you had to read it in the paper/ But everything\u2019s alright with me and your momma\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about my personal journey with my family, and creating a family that\u2019s built on compassion and understanding,\u201d she says, in her broad, new age-y way. \u201cThat\u2019s not an easy road. A lot of the modern family is children from different relationships. That\u2019s what family is today, and there\u2019s never been a song about how beautiful it is. There\u2019s no end to what the family dynamic can look like, as long as it is filled with love for the kids. \u201d</p> <p>Her stepchildren, she says, call her Umi, which is Arabic for mother. Kasseem Dean is Muslim: \u201c4 years of greatness and cheers to 100 plus more inshallah\u201d he Instagrammed, on their anniversary. I ask her if she has converted to Islam. There is a pause, then she says:</p> <p>\u201cI love learning about different religions, and discovering the different ways to worship, and to love the greatness and the higher being that surrounds us all. I definitely believe in a bigger presence, and I really respect all religions; at their core they all teach the same message \u2013 community and kindness and looking out for each other.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HazJhPnrB8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4HazJhPnrB8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HazJhPnrB8\">Watch the video for Alicia Keys\u2019s In Common.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Growing up, she rarely saw her own father, Craig Cook \u2013 an air steward of Jamaican background, who became a masseur \u2013 but she maintained a close relationship with his parents (though her father\u2019s absence was not, she points out, \u201cexactly a topic for the dinner table\u201d).</p> <p>\u201cI did have a deeper relationship with my nana than I did with my father, and again, that\u2019s how life goes.

And her makeup artist recently revealed that the no-makeup look <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2016/oct/10/alicia-keys-no-makeup-look-not-quite-real\">actually requires quite a bit of makeup</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ce1f12c57424c740f2ecb41bd645da78ba974fc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce1f12c57424c740f2ecb41bd645da78ba974fc8/0_0_6208_6934/895.jpg\" alt=\"Alicia Keys\" width=\"895\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alicia Keys: \u2018Mary J Blige really resonated with me because she was from New York.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paola Kudacki</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the campaign certainly suits Keys\u2019s muted, delicately retro R&amp;B persona. Like an American Neneh Cherry, what she was doing 15 years ago feels significant now. Compared with the modern-day vogue for ironic sluttiness, and the subsequent nail-biting over what it means to be feminist in pop, Keys and many of her contemporaries around the millennium offered something comparatively nuanced. Like TLC, her style was boyish \u2013 trousers, boots and braids \u2013 but her lyrics examined love and its vulnerability. One of her signature songs, You Don\u2019t Know My Name, feels almost quaint now, as she poses as a waitress and rings the guy in the \u201cfly blue suit\u201d to ask him out: \u201cI know girls don\u2019t usually do this\u2026\u201d</p> <p>It was a relaxed kind of self-possession, girl power without a soapbox. When I ask her what was going on, she lights up.</p> <p>\u201cIt was good, it was so good,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the 1990s, with Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, those really big female artists were very glamorous, it was all about the glamour at that time. And so there was a big switch, the desire to be more who you were, not so beholden to this whole standard of beauty. It was a liberation. You see Mary J Blige \u2013 she did the same, wearing the combat boots.\u201d</p> <p>So it was an attitude, as much as a fashion?</p> <p>\u201cYeah, definitely. Mary really resonated with me because she was from New York, and that\u2019s what New York looked like: it wasn\u2019t like a beauty pageant, it was a hard, grimy place, and you had to dress accordingly. That represented the type of girl that I was, so that worked for me.\u201d</p> <p>Does she think there\u2019s been a change, in the way female R&amp;B looks now?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/21/alicia-keys-review-roundhouse-london\">Alicia Keys review \u2013 soul singer opens door to blistering basement bash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYes. To me, it just seems like there\u2019s a lot less variety,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you talk about the TLCs, or the Marys, you had a chance to see women in different orbits. [TLC\u2019s] Chilli was one way, T-Boz had a whole other style. Now, I think we see almost only one thing when it comes to female performers. Obviously they\u2019re beautiful, so you want to emulate that. But I think there\u2019s some confusion as to what beauty looks like \u2013 it can only be oversexualised. What\u2019s refreshing is when you see people who know how to express themselves in a multitude of ways.</p> <p>\u201cWe think \u2013 or maybe we\u2019re shown \u2013 that the only way to express ourselves is through that very sexy energy.

  "<p>From the day that she stepped into Number 10, it has been a no-brainer to some of her colleagues that Theresa May ought to call an early general election. As it has also been to many MPs on the other side of the Commons. Her majority in parliament is slender and just became slimmer with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/stephen-phillips-resigns-over-undemocratic-brexit-process\" title=\"\">resignation of the Tory MP Stephen Phillips</a>, a disillusioned Outer. The Conservatives are favourites to retake his seat, but they won\u2019t be so fortunate with other byelections. John Major started with a larger majority in the parliament that began in 1992 and had lost it by the time he was done. Another reason for her to go to the country early is that the Tory majority doesn\u2019t really belong to Mrs May. It was won by Whatshisname, that bloke who used to live at Number 10. She lacks the personal mandate that flows to a prime minister who has won an election in her own right.</p> <p>The way she has behaved towards senior members of the old regime has created a big club of enemies on her backbenches. Asked recently what he was up to, one very senior figure in the Cameron cabinet smiled: \u201cBiding my time.\u201d Then there is Brexit. At some point in this parliament, probably at several points, there will be torrid political and constitutional crises over Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. There will be resignations by ministers. There will be deadlocks and breakdowns in the negotiations. It is highly likely that there will be serious economic convulsions as well. Better, so goes an argument popular with Tory MPs, for Mrs May to armour herself with the much larger majority that the opinion polls indicate can be hers for the asking. That would give her five clear years to get through Brexit and all its havocs.</p> <p>Mrs May has heard those arguments \u2013 and used to dismiss them. She said the voters weren\u2019t clamouring for an election. She thought that what the country most wanted was stability. It didn\u2019t fit with her image of herself to do something that would look opportunistic. Nor did it suit her risk-averse temperament. Her team calculated that Labour was in such a dreadful state that the Tories didn\u2019t need to rush for a quick kill.</p> <p>Has that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/ruling-on-brexit-opens-way-to-mps-revolt\" title=\"\">calculus been changed</a> by the high court ruling that the government must secure parliamentary approval before it can formally trigger divorce proceedings with the European Union? It has. The court ruling was not, as the more hysterical Brextremists have been frothing, an example of elitist judges frustrating the will of the people. The court was reasserting the fundamental principle that the executive cannot rule by monarchical decree, but must seek the consent of parliament if it wants to change the law. There is an alternative to the rule of law \u2013 it is called dictatorship. Those who campaigned to leave the EU in the name of restoring parliamentary sovereignty ought to be able to grasp this.</p> <p>The government might overturn the ruling with a successful appeal to the supreme court, but that looks unlikely. If the supremes agree that the government has to ask parliament before it can activate Article 50, it is as yet unclear how Mrs May intends to conform to the instruction. Some in government seem to think that they might get away with tabling a crude take-it-or-leave-it motion demanding that parliament simply rubber-stamps her decision. That would be defiant of the spirit of the court ruling and perhaps also of its letter. Which is why some ministers think they will have to bring forward legislation.</p> <p>Parliament would not take that as an opportunity to block Brexit. Most MPs were Remainers and so were the majority of peers, but they are not going to flatly defy the referendum result. Parliament might have something to say about the timing of the departure. March is a lousy choice of month to start the countdown to withdrawal. There is a presidential election in France next spring and German elections are due in the early autumn. Nothing meaningful will be negotiated until these are over, which means Mrs May\u2019s current plan simply diminishes the time available to try to make a success of it. MPs and peers could be doing both her and Britain a favour if they slowed her down by a few months.</p> <p>What parliament will definitely do is demand to know more about the government\u2019s exit strategy, if I am not being naive in imagining that such a thing exists. For more than a hundred days, Mrs May has sheltered behind the meaningless mantra \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/17/theresa-may-brexit-early-general-election\" title=\"\">As one of the first to mock</a> the vacuity of that tautology, I have to confess that it has proved a more durable blocking mechanism than I anticipated, a testimony to the potency of stubborn repetition. One explanation for this long silence could be that the government has an exit plan of such elegance that it is being kept concealed to build up the suspense and increase our collective awe when it is revealed in all its brilliance. No, me neither.</p> <p>I was at the <em>Spectator</em> parliamentary awards dinner when Boris Johnson had the audience in involuntary spasms by declaring that the government would make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/brexit-will-be-titanic-success-says-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">a \u201ctitanic success\u201d of Brexit.</a> There are some deckchairs over there that need rearranging, foreign secretary. The prime minister responded with a threat that was no less vicious for coming in the guise of a joke. Mr Johnson had unwisely compared himself with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/01/michael-heseltine-confesses-strangling-mothers-dog-to-death-kim-alsatian\" title=\"\">alsatian throttled by Michael Heseltine.</a> Mrs May said: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37863003\" title=\"\">\u201cBoris, the dog was put down when its master decided it wasn\u2019t needed any more.\u201d</a> Yes. She really did. In a room crowded with senior politicians and journalists, the prime minister told her foreign secretary that she would kill him when it pleased her.</p> <p>The government is concealing its intentions not to keep the EU guessing but to try to hide its internal confusions and divisions.</p> <p>When the negotiations begin, and that will be in less than six months\u2019 time if Mrs May preserves her timetable, a lot of it will become very public anyway. She will have to tell all the key actors in the EU, including the commission and the heads of government, what sort of deal she is looking for. It will not stay secret for five minutes. The big trade-off at the heart of the negotiation will be between immigration and trade. That is already known, as are the various permutations of a deal. One of the arguments for not calling an election was that it would force an early reveal of precisely what Mrs May wants from the negotiation and that would inflame Tory divisions. If the consequence of the court ruling is that she has to show more of her hand anyway, that reason for avoiding an early election falls away. The Fixed Term Parliament Act is often cited as an obstacle. Written into the statute book during the coalition years to stop the Tories doing the dirty on the Lib Dems or vice-versa, the legislation does make it more laborious to trigger an election. In the old days, the prime minister could just pop down to Buck House to ask for a dissolution and her majesty would oblige. To get an early election, the government would have to engineer a confidence vote and deliberately lose it. That would look strange. It might try to repeal the Act, but that could run into trouble in the Lords. Alternatively, an election can be triggered if two-thirds of MPs vote to have one. That would be hard for the opposition parties to frustrate. As one senior Labour figure puts it: \u201cOppositions don\u2019t vote against elections.\u201d</p> <p>Labour and the Lib Dems, having both called for an election when Mrs May became prime minister, would find it difficult to explain why they didn\u2019t want one. You might think that Labour would nevertheless try to prevent an election when its poll rating is so dire and the Tories <a href=\"https://www.icmunlimited.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016_oct2_guardian.pdf\" title=\"\">have a robust lead</a> often in double figures. Mrs May is <a href=\"https://www.the guardian.com/politics/2016/oct/22/twice-voters-theresa-may-jeremy-corbyn-economy-brexit%E2%80%94opinium-observer-poll\" title=\"\">trusted by more than twice as many voters</a> as Jeremy Corbyn to run the economy successfully and handle Brexit effectively.</p> <p>That suggests an election would see the obliteration of a substantial chunk of Labour MPs. Yet such is the state of the party that a surprisingly large number of its MPs ache for an election, if only to be put out of their misery. \u201cI guess about half of my colleagues secretly want an early election,\u201d says one Labour MP. \u201cThey think, \u2018What the hell, let\u2019s roll the dice, things couldn\u2019t be any worse.\u2019\u201d Though they could, you know. An election in the first half of next year is not yet a certainty, but it has become quite a lot likelier. And, unusually, although for very different reasons, it would be welcome to many MPs on both sides of the Commons.</p> <p>I also detect a subtle, but significant, change in the language coming out of Downing Street when it is asked the question. On Friday, a Number 10 spokesperson declared: \u201cWe have been very clear: there is no requirement for a general election before 2020.\u201d That\u2019s not really clear at all. That\u2019s not the same as saying that there definitely won\u2019t be one. There\u2019s no requirement for me to have steak and chips for my dinner, but I might choose to do so all the same.</p>",

He has blamed a nonexistent crime wave on Mexican immigrants and pledged to get tough with, yes, refugees from Syria.

It is a place of yachts and celebrities and fussy shrubbery; of waterfront mansions and Ivy League professors and closed-off beaches. The markers of lifestyle enlightenment are all around you: foods that are organic. Clothing that is tasteful. A conspicuous absence of cigarette butts. Sometimes, the perversity of the place is capable of slapping you right in the face. I was reminded of this as I strolled through one of the polished, stately towns on Martha\u2019s Vineyard and came across a shop selling reproductions of old T-shirts, sports memorabilia and the like. On the outside wall of the shop hung a poem by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/24/charles-bukowski-on-cats-book-published\">Charles Bukowski</a>, because, of course, nothing goes better with tasteful clothing than transgressive poetry. It\u2019s about the horror of blue-collar life, about \u201cmen I\u2019ve known\u201d who work in factories and who do the kind of dehumanising labour that no one who passes by here ever does any more.</p> <p>When I think of the men I\u2019ve known who work in factories, I often think of a group of locked-out workers I met in Decatur, Illinois, in 1994, during the early days of the Bill Clinton administration. Their quintessentially average town was embroiled in three industrial actions: in addition to a lockout at Tate &amp; Lyle\u2019s Staley plant, there were strikes at Caterpillar and at Firestone. The contests grew bitter; the police grew violent; the workers made common cause with one another; people started referring to Decatur as the \u201cwar zone\u201d.</p> <p>What they meant by this phrase was not merely that cops could be mean, but that capitalism had declared war on blue-collar prosperity itself. As a locked-out worker told me in 1994, after reflecting on industrial struggles of the past: \u201cNow it\u2019s our turn. And if we don\u2019t do it, then the middle class as we know it in this country will die. There will be two classes and it will be the very very poor and the very very rich.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a34db05701005f475596d6ec45d1bfdbfa591d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a34db05701005f475596d6ec45d1bfdbfa591d4/0_173_3043_1826/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Striking UAW members picket the Caterpillar factory in Decatur, Illinois in November 1991.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Striking UAW members picket the Caterpillar factory in Decatur, Illinois in November 1991.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seth Perlman/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Was he ever right about that. In a scholarly paper about social class published in 1946, the sociologist <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/22115\">C Wright Mills</a> found that \u201cbig business and executives\u201d in Decatur earned a little more than two times as much as the town\u2019s \u201cwage workers\u201d. In 2014, by contrast, the CEO of Archer Daniels Midland, a company that dominates Decatur today, earned an estimated 261 times as much as average-wage workers. The CEO of Caterpillar, the focus of one of the \u201cwar-zone\u201d strikes, made 486 times as much. Caterpillar\u2019s share price, meanwhile, is roughly 10 times what it was at the time of the strike.</p> <p>Other changes to sweep that town since the war-zone days of the 90s are just as familiar, just as awful. For one thing, Decatur\u2019s population has shrunk by about 12% since then. Despite this outflow of people, in early 2015, the place still had the highest unemployment rate in Illinois.</p> <p>In 2015, I went back to Decatur to catch up with veterans of the war zone such as Larry Solomon, who had been the leader of the local <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/13/new-generation-of-united-auto-workers-push-to-end-second-tier-union-status\">United Automobile Workers</a> union at the Caterpillar plant. He went back in after the strike ended but retired in 1998. When I met Solomon in his tidy suburban home, he talked in detail about the many times he got crossways with management in days long past, about all the grievances he filed for his co-workers over the years and all the puffed-up company officials he recalls facing down.</p> <p>Think about that for a moment: a blue-collar worker who has retired fairly comfortably, despite having spent years confronting his employer on picket lines and in grievance hearings. How is such a thing possible? I know we\u2019re all supposed to show nothing but love for the job creators nowadays, but listening to Solomon, it occurred to me that maybe his attitude worked better. Maybe it was that attitude, repeated in workplace after workplace across the country, which made possible the middle-class prosperity that once marked America as a nation.</p> <p>\u201cWe were promised, all during the time we worked at Caterpillar, that when you retire, you\u2019re going to have a pension and full benefits at no cost to you,\u201d Solomon recalled. He told about a round of contract negotiations he and his colleagues attended in the 1960s during which a management official complained: \u201cWe already take care of you from the cradle to the grave. What more could you want?\u201d</p> <p>Today, that old social contract is gone or, at least, the part of it that ensured healthcare and retirement for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/10/zero-hours-contracts-worse-jobs-for-life-work-unions\">blue-collar workers</a>. Now, as Solomon sees it, companies can say: \u201cWe want your life, and when your work life is over, then goodbye. We thank you for your life, but we\u2019re not responsible for you after we turn you out.\u201d</p> <p>Mike Griffin had been another outspoken union activist, in his case during the lockout at Tate &amp; Lyle. When we met up last year, we talked about the situation that faces the younger generation in Decatur, people for whom the basic components of middle-class life are growing further and further out of reach. Though they might not always get it politically, Griffin said, those workers can most definitely see how screwed they are. \u201cOne of the things that they do understand is that they got shit jobs with shit wages and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/09/federal-contract-workers-complaint-new-minimum-wage-standard\">no benefits and no health insurance</a>,\u201d he told me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cafe92c586e5ca8b6142e085c542644eb273e2b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cafe92c586e5ca8b6142e085c542644eb273e2b4/0_353_4268_2760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of a $15 minimum wage for fast food workers rally in front of a McDonald\u2019s in Albany, New York State.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of a $15 minimum wage for fast food workers rally in front of a McDonald\u2019s in Albany, New York State.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Groll/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAnd they understand,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat they\u2019re working two and three jobs just to get by, a lot of them can\u2019t own anything and they understand seeing Mom and Dad forced into retirement or forced out of their job, now they\u2019re working at <a href=\"http://www.hardees.com/\">Hardee\u2019s</a> or McDonald\u2019s to make ends meet so they can retire in poverty. People understand that. They see that.\u201d</p> <p>Those awful words are a fairly accurate account of the situation faced by a vast part of the population in America, a population that was brought up expecting to enjoy life in what it is often told is the richest country in the world. It is not really the fault of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/04/obama-support-minimum-wage-inequality-speech\">Barack Obama</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/07/clinton-era-welfare-reforms-american-poor-bernie-sanders\">Bill Clinton</a> that things have unfolded in such a lousy way for these people. As everyone knows, it is the Republicans that ushered the world into the neoliberal age; that cut the taxes of the rich with a kind of religious conviction; that did so much to unleash Wall Street and deregulate everything else; that declared eternal war on the welfare state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/04/obama-support-minimum-wage-inequality-speech\">Obama throws support to minimum wage movement in economy speech</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But history works in strange ways. Another thing the Republicans did, beginning in the late 60s, was to present themselves as the party of ordinary, unaffected people, of what Richard Nixon (and now Donald Trump) called the \u201csilent majority\u201d. They cast the war between right and left as a kind of inverted class struggle, in which humble, hard-working, God-fearing citizens would choose to align themselves with the party of Herbert Hoover.</p> <p>And so Republicans smashed unions and cut the taxes of the rich even as they praised blue-collar citizens for their patriotism and their \u201cfamily values\u201d. Working-class \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d left their party to back a man who performed enormous favours for the wealthy and who did more than anyone to usher the world into its modern course of accelerating inequality.</p> <p>Everything in those decades seemed to be a class issue, everything, that is, except matters of economics and distribution, where free-market orthodoxy prevailed. In 2004, I went back to my home state of Kansas to ask why it had moved so far to the right since the days of Dwight Eisenhower; the answer, I discovered, was the culture wars \u2013 abortion, gun control, obscenity, education and so on.</p> <p>And beneath every one of these culture war issues lay the burning insult of snobbery. A \u201cliberal elite\u201d, it seemed, was forever conspiring against the values of ordinary people, telling them what to do and how to do it without any concern for what they actually believed. The best thing about the culture wars was that they required the Republicans to deliver very little to their growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/07/donald-trump-why-americans-support\">blue-collar base</a>; the wars were unwinnable almost by definition, a matter of entertainment rather than politics in the traditional sense. The ones who got tangible gains out of this form of populism were the party\u2019s clients among the business elite.</p> <p>In the decades I am describing, Republicans also perfected the ugly art of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/21/trump-clinton-gun-control-policies-race-policing\">concealed racist appeal</a>, which helped them to win many of the southern states and plenty of white votes in other places and whose echoes we hear so distinctly in the Trump campaign. Between that nasty strategy and the working-class outreach I am describing, Republicans enjoyed years of electoral success. At the top of the party structure stood the interests it served \u2013 big business, the very rich \u2013 and at the bottom was its mass constituency, which seemed to grow more proletarian and more frustrated as the years passed.</p> <p>This mixture of cultural populism and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/04/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-brexit-anti-establishment-politics\">free-market orthodoxy</a> was not a stable one. Doing favours for the rich while encouraging fruitless, culture-based class grievances among working people was a contradiction difficult to sustain, a delicate balancing act that could only be pulled off as long as the economy stayed reasonably good and the price tag of inequality remained bearable.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\">financial crisis of 2008</a> and the lingering recession shattered the whole thing. By 2016, as blue-collar wages continued to stagnate and inequality to worsen, the base of the Republican party had lost its appetite for pointless culture crusades: they demanded something real. And of the 17 Republican candidates for president this year, Donald Trump offered exactly that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/04/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-brexit-anti-establishment-politics\">Trump, Brexit and demand for change: the year of the political outsider</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He railed against a rotten political establishment that did nothing for working people; he promised to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/21/guardian-view-on-us-presidency-time-is-right-for-female-leader-hillary-clinton\">defend social security</a> and to renegotiate the trade deals that are widely blamed for the deindustrialisation of the midwest. He also scapegoated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/31/peter-thiel-defends-donald-trump-muslim-ban-mexico-wall\">Muslims and illegal immigrants</a>, blaming them falsely for all manner of offences. And he did it all in the bluntest terms, with a self-absorbed way of speaking that somehow captured the imagination of this unhappy era. Even his grotesque, bombastic style seemed to confirm his appeal; at the Republican convention in July, I heard him described as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/republican-reaction-donald-trump-speech-convention\">blue-collar billionaire</a>\u201d.</p> <p>From one perspective, Trump\u2019s rise has merely marked the evolution of Republican populism. It has always been a form of entertainment, and Trump is a captivating entertainer. Traditional Republican leaders, however, regard Trump as a pariah, thanks to his market-offending stands on trade, social security and bank regulation. These leaders have abandoned him in droves, while he has promised to remake the Republicans into a \u201cworkers\u2019 party.\u201d</p> <p>But what has also made Trumpism possible is the simultaneous evolution of the Democrats, the traditional workers\u2019 party, over the period I have been describing. They went from being the party of Decatur to the party of Martha\u2019s Vineyard and they did so at roughly the same time that the Republicans were sharpening their deadly image of the \u201cliberal elite\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b70e18ca01d3a772107cfc0f3709611da7670155\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b70e18ca01d3a772107cfc0f3709611da7670155/0_16_3921_2353/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton at a CNN Democratic presidential debate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton at a TV debate: the Democratic party has \u2018mounted notable efforts to cajole or shame\u2019 young former Sanders supporters to vote for Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Locher/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so the reversal is complete and the worst choice ever is upon us. We are invited to select between a populist demagogue and a liberal royalist, a woman whose every step on the campaign trail has been planned and debated and smoothed and arranged by powerful manipulators. The Wall Street money is with the Democrats this time, and so is Silicon Valley, and so is the media, and so is Washington, and so, it sometimes seems, is righteousness itself. Hillary Clinton appears before us all in white, the beneficiary of a saintly kind of subterfuge.</p> <p>If there is any hope left in the American system, it lies with a generation of young voters who are gigantically frustrated with the choices offered by two-party politics. Earlier this year, many thousands of them enlisted in the unlikely crusade of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a self-described \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d, and now they are, it seems, so disaffected with the woman who defeated him that the Democratic party has mounted notable efforts to cajole them back into the fold.</p> <p>Like the blue-collar people of Decatur, these young people know all about our predatory modern capitalism, know that they are fated to toil at some gig job in their crumbling deindustrialised city, slowly paying off the 30 or 40 grand they borrowed to study science technology, engineering and maths at the state U. And they are to be forgiven if they can\u2019t see the promise in the Clinton restoration, or some modern-day Louis XIV, or even in the American way of life.</p> <p><em>Excerpted in part from Listen Liberal, published by Scribe (\u00a39.99).</em></p>",

There will not be another Breeders\u2019 Cup here for at least three years \u2013 it moves down the coast to Del Mar next year, and then across to Churchill Downs, the home of the Kentucky Derby, in 2018 \u2013 and yesterday\u2019s opening card drew a record attendance for a Breeders\u2019 Cup Friday of nearly 46,000. They will hope to beat the 61,000 attendance for the Saturday card here two years ago, and the two-day total should easily surpass 100,000 for the first time. </p> <p>The all-important betting \u201chandle\u201d on Friday\u2019s four Breeders\u2019 Cup races was also up significantly on the same four events when the meeting was held at Keeneland 12 months ago, despite a significant drop in the number of runners (from 53 to 43). And best of all, the crowd were treated to a race for the ages in the feature event, the Distaff, as Beholder ended her outstanding career by inflicting a first defeat on Songbird after a brilliant duel down the home stretch.</p> <p>If there is another race to match that on today\u2019s nine-race card, we will indeed be very privileged. It is a far from impossible, though, as there has been widespread agreement around the barns this week that this year\u2019s meeting is the best and most competitive that the Breeders\u2019 Cup has seen.</p> <p>The highlight for the American fans this evening is undoubtedly California Chrome\u2019s attempt to win the Classic, a race in which he was touched off by Bayern and Toast Of New York here two years ago, another race that few who saw it will ever forget. Arrogate, who broke a long-standing track record with an exceptional front-running performance in the Travers Stakes at Saratoga, is seen as his main opponent, and many here hope, or even expect, to see the two horses lock horns at the top of the stretch and fight all the way to the wire.</p> <p>The Europeans drew a blank here on Friday, though we had runners in just two of the four races, but it will be a huge disappointment if that run continues later today. There a big hopes in all four of today\u2019s events on turf, including the Turf Sprint, a race that has been somewhat overlooked by European trainers in the past. Washington DC goes in that race for Aidan O\u2019Brien, and he certainly seemed quietly confident about his chance earlier in the week.</p> <p>Found, the Arc winner, is the biggest name on the card from a European point of view, and she will probably be making the last start of her career in the Turf. She faces tough opposition from her stable companion Highland Reel, however, as well as Flintshire, who was very useful for Andre Fabre earlier on in his career and is now the best middle-distance turf horse in America by some way.</p> <p>Limato and Alice Springs are the leaders of a strong challenge to Tepin, the US-trained Queen Anne Stakes winner at Royal Ascot in the summer, in the Mile, which is the penultimate race on the card. And Sir Michael Stoute\u2019s Queen\u2019s Trust is a live contender for the Filly &amp; Mare Turf, alongside yet another O\u2019Brien star, Seventh Heaven.</p> <p>All-in-all, it should be a frantic and compelling afternoon of action. The Breeders\u2019 Cup card starts at 19.05 GMT with the Juvenile Fillies\u2019 and it will be a non-stop rollercoaster ride from there. I look forward to bringing you all the news, results, reports and post-race quotes as they happen, and tweets and comments would be greatly appreciated too.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581dc16fe4b029b92ca45c87\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T11:30:03.496Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Greg will be along shortly. </strong>On Friday, Songbird surrendered her unbeaten record to Beholder in an epic Breeders\u2019 Cup Distaff at Santa Anita.

  "<p>Highland Reel, the winner of the King George at Ascot in July, gave Aidan O\u2019Brien his first winner at this year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup meeting on Saturday under an outstanding front-running ride by Seamie Heffernan.</p> <p>With Ryan Moore, O\u2019Brien\u2019s No1 rider, aboard Found (the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe winner), Heffernan had an excellent opportunity to record his first success at the Breeders\u2019 Cup and he seized the initiative from the early stages of this mile-and-a-half contest.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/23/ryan-moore-highland-reel-ascot-king-george-frankel-fair-eva-horse-racing\" title=\"\">Highland Reel</a> was in front within a few strides, and led Ectot as the field turned away from the stands with a circuit to run while Found raced much further back with only a couple of opponents behind her. Heffernan then kicked even further clear down the back stretch, and was six lengths to the good going into the final turn.</p> <p>Heffernan still had a healthy lead at the top of the straight, and though his opponents were now well aware that they had handed a multiple Group One winner a soft lead, it was too late to do anything about it. Flintshire, America\u2019s best middle-distance turf horse, closed the gap in the straight under Javier Castellano, but he was still one-and-three-quarter lengths adrift of the winner at the line.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/04/highland-reel-breeders-cup-turf-aidan-obrien-horse-racing\">Highland Reel can land Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf for dominant Aidan O\u2019Brien yard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Found, who will now retire to the paddocks, ran on into third place without ever looking entirely at ease on the quick ground, while Ulysses was fourth for Sir Michael Stoute.</p> <p>\u201cWe knew that he gets a mile-and-a-half well, that he handles fast ground and doesn\u2019t mind dictating,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cSo it was straightforward really, but Seamus executed it brilliantly. He controlled the race perfectly. He kicked at the right time, and really the race was over from a long way out.</p> <p>\u201cHe has two options now, in the Japan Cup and a race in Hong Kong. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be able to take in two or take in one, but we\u2019ll see how he is. But he\u2019s an incredibly versatile horse that loves travelling.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier on the card, Stoute, already the most successful British trainer in Breeders\u2019 Cup history, added a seventh victory to his record as Queen\u2019s Trust and Frankie Dettori edged ahead of the favourite Lady Eli on the line to win the Breeders\u2019 Cup Filly &amp; Mare Turf.</p> <p>Dettori was at his outstanding best to snatch victory from Lady Eli and Irad Ortiz, having broken from a wide berth in stall 11 which forced him to sit well off the pace. Queen\u2019s Trust had not enjoyed much luck in running in several previous races this season, but there was no danger that she would be blocked here as Dettori pulled her to the middle of the track at the top of the stretch and set out to run down the leader, Avenge.</p> <p>Lady Eli was nearly three lengths in front of Queen\u2019s Trust as Dettori launched his challenge, and Ortiz\u2019s mount only got to Avenge well inside the final furlong. Queen\u2019s Trust was finishing even faster than the favourite, however, and Dettori\u2019s perfectly timed pursuit ensured she had her head in front when it really mattered.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we got to the backstretch, basically I tried to find a spot where I could get into a challenging position,\u201d Dettori said.</p> <p>\u201cI was very fortunate mid-turn because I got behind the favourite, and then she got a jump on me and my first thought was, well, I\u2019ll be a good third.</p> <p>\u201cThen she started to motor and it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s a short straight but those last hundred yards make a big difference. She got into top gear, and we flashed past the line and I was pretty much sure we\u2019d won.\u201d</p> <p>Stoute has now won the Filly &amp; Mare Turf three times, to go with four victories in the Turf, a record that stretches back to Pilsudski\u2019s victory in the latter race in 1996.</p> <p>But European hopes were dashed in the Mile when Henry Candy\u2019s Limato faded from a furlong out behind Bill Mott\u2019s runner Tourist, with last year\u2019s Mile winner Tepin in second place. Midnight Storm completed a 1-2-3 for US-trained horses.</p> <p>The Turf Sprint also went the way of the Americans, with O\u2019Brien\u2019s Washington DC out of the frame behind Obviously, a veteran eight-year-old who has lined up for the Mile three times in the past. Home Of The Brave, from Hugo Palmer\u2019s stable in Newmarket, was also unplaced, along with Undrafted, who took the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot for his American trainer Wesley Ward in June 2015.</p> <p>The feature event of the meeting produced another exceptional finish as Arrogate, the second-favourite, got up to beat the market leader California Chrome after a protracted duel down the straight.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/mar/27/california-chrome-dubai-world-cup-american-meydan-global-appeal-horse-racing\" title=\"\">California Chrome</a> made the running and looked to be going easily as he turned for home, but Mike Smith had Arrogate a couple of lengths behind and the three-year-old showed tremendous courage to eat into California Chrome\u2019s lead before passing him a few strides before the line.</p> <p>The winner carried the pink, green and white colours of Prince Khalid Abdullah so familiar to European fans thanks to the exploits of horses like Dancing Brave and Frankel, and gave Bob Baffert his third consecutive success in the Classic.</p>",
  "<p>Melania Trump appears to have spent the entire US election as a sort of anti-Michelle Obama \u2013 whatever she does, however hard she tries. Not that she\u2019s been that visible \u2013 her husband has mainly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/21/ivanka-trump-speech-republican-convention-women-gender-pay-mothers\" title=\"\">put his daughter, Ivanka,</a> in the first lady spot on his campaigning chain-gang. When Melania has been thrust into the spotlight, it\u2019s been to do a manifestly sub-par nerve-racked turn, before scurrying back into the shadows, amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/melania-trump-republican-convention-plagiarism-michelle-obama\" title=\"\">accusations (at the mildest) of speech-plagiarism.</a></p> <p>Now Melania has made another so-so speech (keeping to the relatively safe topic of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/melania-trump-cyberbullying-campaign-speech\" title=\"\">childhood bullying</a>). There have also been further allegations about Melania <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/05/melania-trump-was-paid-modeling-before-work-visa-records-show#img-1\" title=\"\">working as a model</a> before officially obtaining her US work visa. Does it matter? Of course it does (it makes a mockery of her husband\u2019s relentless anti-immigrant rhetoric). Another question could be: does Melania matter? After all this time, does she even exist as a legitimate separate entity outside of her husband\u2019s swirling toxic orbit?</p> <p>Throughout the Trump campaign, Melania has been simultaneously defined and eclipsed by her husband, which, considering his well-documented views on women, probably suits him just fine. With a man like Trump (an ego driven by a sonic blast of narcissistic personality disorder), it makes a weird kind of sense that his daughter (his issue, his blood) is given pole female position, validating his genetic grandiloquence (subtext: everything that is of Trump is magnificent!), while his third wife (with her \u201cchequered\u201d past) is given tasks and duties almost as an afterthought.</p> <p>Melania has been bounced down the Republican campaigning ranks from player to mere decorative human accessory, given as much significance and influence as Trump\u2019s choice of tie at a rally. At the same time, in every negative, dehumanising way possible, Melania has been completely defined by her husband. Of course, something similar also happened to Hillary Clinton \u2013 an actual candidate \u2013 who\u2019s spent her entire campaign being pelted by rocks for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/wikileaks-bill-clinton-foundation-emails\" title=\"\">\u201csins of Bill\u201d.</a></p> <p>The difference is that Hillary has at least (small mercies) also been attacked for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/hillary-clinton-why-hate-unlikeable-us-election\" title=\"\">who she is</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/hillary-clinton-latest-emails-explained\" title=\"\">what she\u2019s done.</a> Then there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/29/michelle-obama-we-need-an-adult-in-the-white-house-video\" title=\"\">Michelle Obama,</a> whose charisma seems at once amplified by her husband, while also robustly being independent of him. By contrast, from start to finish, the pressure has been on Melania to atone publicly for all her husband is and everything he represents, her every word and deed viewed and judged entirely via the omnipresent prism of the Donald.</p> <p>So what? you might ask. As the saying goes, if you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas. But although associations are important, ultimately, only Donald Trump should be attacked for being Donald Trump.</p> <p>Certainly, it seems too easy and dangerous to assess women solely via the medium of their men. You can already see it happening with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2016/nov/02/when-harry-met-meghan-markle-and-dragged-the-royals-into-the-21st-century\" title=\"\">Prince Harry and his new partner, Meghan Markel</a>, a successful, attractive biracial actress being systematically reduced to how she, her heritage and achievements fit in with The Almighty Him. As a feminist, it makes me feel uneasy watching Markel being defined via her \u201csuitability\u201d for Harry, as if this were her only pertinent characteristic, all other nuance and agency of a living, breathing, thirtysomething individual cheapened or obliterated.</p> <p>If this makes a soul uneasy, then perhaps the same courtesy should be extended to Melania Trump. Melania probably wouldn\u2019t make a great first lady. (Not so much the anti-Michelle, as simply inadequate). However, the fact remains that during a wild, dirty election, Hillary Clinton emerged hurt by Bill, but not felled by him, Michelle gloriously stepped out of Barack\u2019s shadow and even Ivanka is relatively unscathed. Only Melania wafts around like an election phantom whose only function is to be viewed and judged entirely via the medium of her husband. While it\u2019s not surprising that this happened, it\u2019s telling that nobody seems to mind a bit.</p> <h2>Salute Sting for relaunching the Bataclan</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"057f0fd5dccf794c5647963dcc624af1ac7fb29c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/057f0fd5dccf794c5647963dcc624af1ac7fb29c/0_134_4770_2862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sting\u2019s appearance will be a boost for the Bataclan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sting\u2019s appearance will be a boost for the Bataclan.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tatan Syuflana/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sting will be the first musician to perform at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/20/bataclan-witnesses-recount-horror-paris-attacks\" title=\"\">Bataclan theatre</a> in Paris since the terrorist attacks last November that killed 130 people, 89 of them at the venue.</p> <p>A separate event has been planned, according to ed reports, to mark the anniversary of the attacks, attended by survivors and the band that performed on the night of the attack, the American group Eagles of Death Metal, whose roadie Nick Alexander died.

  "<p>Theresa May\u2019s hopes of a post-Brexit trade deal with India suffered a hammer blow from Delhi as the prime minister prepared to make her first official visit to the country.</p> <p>A spokesman for India\u2019s minister of external affairs suggested that a policy brought in by May as home secretary restricting the right of Indian students to stay in the UK after graduation could prove to be a block on any progress.</p> <p>Before her first bilateral visit outside Europe on Sunday, taking 33 business representatives to India, May said she wished to \u201creboot\u201d the relationship between the two countries. \u201cThe UK and India are natural partners \u2013 the world\u2019s oldest democracy and the world\u2019s largest democracy \u2013 and together I believe we can achieve great things \u2013 delivering jobs and skills, developing new technologies and improving our cities, tackling terrorism and climate change,\u201d she said.</p> <p>However the Indian government spokesman, Vikas Swarup, told the <em>Observer</em> that May faced tough questions when she arrived in Delhi on immigration and mobility for Indian students and workers in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cIndian students and people-to-people relations are important pillars of India-UK ties,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last five years or so, the number of Indian students enrolling in UK universities has gone down by almost 50%; from around 40,000 to about 20,000 now. This has happened because of restrictions on post-study stay in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cWe will continue to raise our concerns regarding mobility with the UK. Mobility of people is closely linked to free flow of finance, goods and services.\u201d</p> <p>The comments came as the former business secretary, Vince Cable, claimed that May\u2019s relations with India would be a major block to making progress on any UK-India deal. He said: \u201cThe chances of them getting anything out of India are pretty remote pending a complete volte-face<em> </em>on immigration and visas.\u201d</p> <p>The former Liberal Democrat MP said that among a series of policy decisions by the Home Office, May\u2019s refusal to allow greater access to the UK for skilled Indian workers, in particular, \u201cscrewed up\u201d chances of an EU-India trade deal. He said: \u201cWhen I was secretary of state I was involved in trying to negotiate the EU-India trade agreement, which didn\u2019t get very far. This myth has been created that we are not able to make progress on deals because of Wallonia or Slovenia. In this particular case, the problem was Britain.</p> <p>\u201cMay in particular was very obstructive of any attempt to make a genuine generous concession, and that was one of the things that screwed up the negotiation.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010, when she was home secretary, May scrapped the post-study work visa, which allowed foreign students a two-year work permit in the UK after completing a course at a British university. Indian students now find it difficult even to get internships or part-time work while they study in the UK.</p> <p>In 2013 May tried to introduce a controversial \u201cvisa bond\u201d scheme for foreign students from six African and Asian countries, of which India was the biggest, to prevent \u201chigh-risk\u201d students staying in the UK after their work permits expired. The scheme, which was not introduced in the end, caused widespread outrage among Indian students at the time and Cable said it was \u201cremembered\u201d by Indian politicians.</p> <p>May is travelling to India with 30 &#xa0;British businesses, including small- and medium-sized enterprises from every region of the country. A series of commercial deals were expected to be sealed during the visit, delivering 1,370 UK jobs, Downing Street said.</p> <p>May and the Indian prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/09/narendra-modi-the-divisive-manipulator-who-charmed-the-world\" title=\"\">Narendra Modi,</a> are due to meet on Monday afternoon for more than two hours of talks on trade, investment, defence and security. Downing Street said May wanted to break down existing trade and investment barriers, and secure agreement to talks that would pave the way for a bilateral trade arrangement once the UK had left the EU. The PM will be accompanied by international trade secretary Liam Fox and trade minister Greg Hands.</p> <p>Before the visit, May said: \u201cThis is a partnership about our shared security and shared prosperity. It is a partnership of potential. I intend to harness that potential, rebooting an age-old relationship in this age of opportunity and with that helping to build a better Britain.\u201d</p> <p>But Shashi Tharoor, chairman of India\u2019s parliamentary standing committee on external affairs, said May\u2019s anti-immigrant policies were \u201cdetrimental\u201d to relations between the UK and India.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI do believe it is as much in Britain\u2019s interests to attract Indian students as it is in India\u2019s interests for our students to study there.</p> <p>\u201cThe Indian government should ask why this is happening, and whether the withdrawal of the welcome mat sends a broader signal, intended or otherwise, to other Indians.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe hope and expectation is that most of the students will return to India with enhanced skills and knowledge, whereas emigrants are lost to India altogether, which gives the Indian government no reason to encourage their departure.</p> <p>\u201cBut again, the broader question is whether these anti-immigrant policies signify an anti-Indian stance which would have broader implications for the relations between the two peoples,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump is coming to the end of one of the most dramatic and unpredictable US presidential campaigns in living memory, scouring swing states for the undecided voters who might make a difference and who might be persuaded by his inflammatory message and swingeing assaults on his Democratic rival.</p> <p>But as he campaigned in Ohio, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania on Friday, a new side of the Republican candidate emerged. He was doing something no-one expected: he was being predictable.</p> <p>As Tuesday\u2019s vote nears, Trump\u2019s rallies are still raucous and he still fills them with wild accusations against Hillary Clinton. A recent favourite is that \u201cif she ever gets into the Oval Office, Hillary and her corrupt friends would rob this country blind\u201d. But his words have become more scripted and controlled, resembling less a Jimi Hendrix guitar solo, full of improvisation, more a jazz musician riffing off a standard tune from the songbook.</p> <p>The enthusiasm of Trump\u2019s crowds has not diminished \u2013 thousands swarm at every stop. On Friday they came to Atkinson, New Hampshire, Wilmington, Ohio, and Hershey, the home of the chocolate giant, in Pennsylvania. When the candidate asked \u201cwho is going to pay for the wall\u201d, they shouted \u201cMexico\u201d deliriously. Dressed in Trump merchandise, they were ready at the slightest provocation to chant \u201cLock her up\u201d or \u201cCNN sucks\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=PA\" data-alt=\"pennsylvania\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=PA\">pennsylvania</a> </figure>  <p>But Trump seemed to sense something had changed. When trotting out his newest line, \u201cDrain the swamp\u201d, both a jibe at what he describes as a corrupt establishment in Washington and a description of his willingness to clean it up, the candidate seemed almost unenthusiastic. He has taken to apologising when the line comes up in speeches.</p> <p>\u201cI hated the expression,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s so hokey.\u201d</p> <p>Trump often notes how Frank Sinatra hated singing My Way, before he realised how much his audience loved it. For Trump the \u201cswamp\u201d slogan, which could come from almost any insurgent political campaign, mounted by either party, is the same thing. If his crowds chant it, he will go along.</p> <p>Yet he is by no means hostage to his crowds. On Friday he guided them along, ensuring they booed the correct villain at the right time, be it Clinton, the media or nondescript globalists intent on taking away US jobs and prosperity.</p> <p>Members of the press corps have become his unwitting accessories. They are penned in, surrounded, while Trump falsely insists that TV cameras are not showing the size of his rallies. That claim goads the crowd into booing the press, who he insists are \u201cthe most dishonest people\u201d. At times, he will even call out reporters by name.</p> <p>This has not provoked any incidents of physical violence \u2013 yet. The sensation is more like that of being an animal on display at the zoo. Trump supporters stand on the other side of the fence, gaping, making faces and occasionally shouting abuse.</p> <p>Things tend to intensify as the hour gets later and Trump, who has rarely been punctual in recent months, falls further behind schedule. By then the crowds, subjected to a loop of the same five songs for several hours, are ready to let loose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=OH\" data-alt=\"ohio\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=OH\">ohio</a> </figure>  <p>But for all the passion and rage that Trump stokes, there is a lack of the bizarre creativity that defined his early campaigning. The candidate who compared the acclaimed neurosurgeon Ben Carson to a child molester and falsely said Texas senator Ted Cruz\u2019s father <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/jul/22/donald-trump-denies-ted-cruz-father-assassination-jfk\">was involved in the assassination of John F Kennedy</a> has been left claiming, wrongly, that Clinton is the subject of multiple criminal investigations. While he has made \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d a Homeric epithet to rival his labelling of former Florida governor Jeb Bush as \u201cLow Energy\u201d or his nicknaming Florida senator Marco Rubio \u201cLittle Marco\u201d and Cruz \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d, it has not had the same effect.</p> <p>The issue is perhaps the lack of any new villains to accompany Clinton, one of the most famous women in the world. Veering away from President Obama, Trump rails against nameless \u201cglobal special interests\u201d who he says ship jobs overseas and leave US borders open. But these attacks are not delivered with the gusto he uses for individuals. He is far more animated when calling for Clinton to fire her campaign chairman, John Podesta, because Podesta described his candidate as having \u201cbad instincts\u201d in a hacked email, than he is when reading a scripted attack on globalists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=NH\" data-alt=\"new hampshire\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=NH\">new hampshire</a> </figure>  <p>The overall effect is of an ageing rock star, living off the glory of past hits. Trump still takes time to recall 16 June 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president\">when he came down \u201cthat famous escalator\u201d</a> at Trump Tower in New York City to announce his campaign. He will often relive moments of glory in his bid for the Republican nomination. Ardent fans show up and buy the merchandise and the star is able to put on a show. But it is an increasingly mechanical exercise.</p> <p>Trump has always been an awkward fit, somewhere between entertainer and politician. After all, the best shows and the most applause-worthy lines don\u2019t always poll the best. At least for the next few days, though, he is willing to repeat his intent to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d, in order to maintain his shot at winning the White House.</p>",
  "<p>There is a scene in the BBC\u2019s adaptation of Zadie Smith\u2019s acclaimed novel <em>NW</em> in which a character listens as her old school friend holds court in her tastefully decorated north-west London home. The talk is of children and schools and house prices, and in that moment the gulf between the two is seemingly laid bare, one listening in disbelief at how far the other has travelled from the council estate they once called home.</p> <p>Yet behind that confident facade, the other woman is no less unsure about her place in the world, about the increasingly white and upper-middle-class world she moves in, about the part of London she still calls home that is inexorably changing day by day. It\u2019s both a painfully acute dissection of how the bonds of old friendship bind us and a sharp commentary on race, class and modern London life. It could only have been imagined by Smith.</p> <p>Ever since she burst on to the literary scene in 2000 at the age of only 24 with her first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jan/26/fiction.zadiesmith\"><em>White Teeth</em></a>, an exuberant coming-of-age tale set in the north-west London community of Willesden, Smith has carved out a reputation as modern London\u2019s finest chronicler. Her fourth novel, <em>NW</em>, a smart, spiky look at whether you can ever truly escape the past that defines you, cemented that reputation. Now this week sees the publication of her eagerly awaited fifth novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/04/swing-time-by-zadie-smith-review\"><em>Swing Time</em></a>, a beautifully written, deeply melancholy meditation on fame and failure.</p> <p>All three books depict a world that\u2019s recognisably 21st-century London: diverse, vivid, at times cacophonous, stuffed full of dreams and aspirations, of fear and friction, where the houses of the wealthy abut the estates of the poor and tension simmers beneath the humour.</p> <p>\u201cLondon feels so real in her books \u2013 the characters feel like people I\u2019ve met and know or talked to or sat next to on the bus,\u201d says Nikesh Shukla, novelist and editor of much-praised essay collection, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/02/the-good-immigrant-edited-nikesh-shukla-essays-race-colour-society-riz-ahmed-kieran-yates-selena-bim\"><em>The Good Immigrant</em></a>. \u201c<em>White Teeth</em> felt like the city I grew up in and <em>NW</em> and <em>Swing Time</em> feel like the city I live in now. They\u2019re very contemporary visions of London that don\u2019t ignore the city\u2019s tensions.\u201d</p> <p>They also depict a part of London too often ignored in favour of Soho\u2019s seedy glamour, the fine houses of Kensington, Mayfair and Hampstead, or the raffish charm of period Islington and Notting Hill. Smith\u2019s books sing of the suburbs that dot the north circular \u2013 Harlesden, Neasden, Wembley and, in particular, Willesden, that link between the inner city of Kilburn High Road and <a href=\"\">John Betjeman\u2019s Metro-Land</a>.</p> <p>Smith has described London as \u201ca state of mind\u201d and her work stands out for the ease with which she pins the capital city to the page. \u201cHer books present a working-class view of immigrants and ethnic identity,\u201d says Ben Judah, author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/24/this-is-london-ben-judah-review-life-and-death-in-the-world-city\"><em>This Is London: Life and Death in the World City</em></a>. \u201cOther writers have written about London well, but they do so from an upper-middle and middle-class background. When I read <em>White Teeth</em> I was blown away \u2013 it was the first time I\u2019d read a book that spoke to the London I lived in.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bab13a5df622dffc37cea0c6800dd9dc53eef7a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bab13a5df622dffc37cea0c6800dd9dc53eef7a2/0_196_4285_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The adaptation of Smith\u2019s fourth novel \u2018NW\u2019 features Cyril Guel and Pheobe Fox.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The adaptation of Smith\u2019s fourth novel \u2018NW\u2019 features Cyril Guel and Pheobe Fox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steffan Hill/BBC/Mammoth Screen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shukla agrees. \u201cZadie\u2019s London is the London I grew up in. It\u2019s not just that I recognise the places, it\u2019s that she writes about a London that\u2019s both flawed and vibrant. She\u2019s writing about the city as a person of colour and nothing is at arm\u2019s length. Everything is real and visceral. You can touch and smell it.\u201d</p> <p>Where writers from Martin Amis to John Lanchester have covered the capital with a level of remove, as though circling the city from above to record its foibles, Smith writes from the bustling high streets of her youth, moving through the crowds purposefully like the native Londoner she is. \u201cIn <em>Swing Time</em> the city, the jobs I did, the pubs and places I know so well are all covered with deft accuracy,\u201d says author and poet Salena Godden, whose memoir <em>Springfield Road</em> covers similar territory. \u201cIt resonated because I enjoyed visiting the psycho-geography of this time in my life.\u201d</p> <p>On one hand there is little new in this. Since Charles Dickens, writers have sought to burrow down into London\u2019s core and expose the city\u2019s teeming soul. In the 30s and 40s, Patrick Hamilton, Norman Collins and Gerald Kersh eagerly strode down its hidden back streets. In the 50s and 60s, Colin MacInnes\u2019s London trilogy turned a journalist\u2019s eye on the dreamers and schemers of Notting Hill and North Kensington, Derek Raymond probed Soho\u2019s seamier edges and Sam Selvon wrote <em>The Lonely Londoners</em>, which remains probably the greatest exploration of London and the immigrant dream. In the 80s and early 90s, Alan Hollinghurst and Oscar Moore chronicled gay life in the capital, and Hanif Kureishi made his name with the 70s-set coming-of-age tale <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/04/the-buddha-of-suburbia\"><em>The Buddha of Suburbia</em></a>. More recently, writers from Diran Adebayo, Courttia Newland and Patrick Neate to Linda Grant, Amanda Craig and Cathi Unsworth have adeptly captured the city\u2019s chaotic rhythms in books as diverse and fascinating as London itself.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She\u2019s very good at illuminating the things we don\u2019t quite see and capturing a very, very mixed world</p> <footer> <cite>Rachel Bennette</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet Smith\u2019s novels stand apart for their ability to convince the reader that they\u2019re there, standing on those crowded streets alongside <em>White Teeth</em>\u2019s self-conscious Irie or <em>NW</em>\u2019s focused Natalie, or trudging into ballet class in a rundown church hall with <em>Swing Time</em>\u2019s unnamed narrator.</p> <p>\u201cEven though I live in south-east London, I can see my London in the London she writes about,\u201d says Rachel Bennette, who adapted <em>NW</em> for the BBC. \u201cThere\u2019s a very strong flavour of the city that comes through her work and makes it incredibly exciting and cinematic. She\u2019s very good at illuminating the things we don\u2019t quite see and capturing a very, very mixed world. <em>NW</em> is an amazing book about social exclusion that is itself highly inclusive. It\u2019s heavily populated and diverse and huge, like London itself.\u201d</p> <p>Interestingly, Smith\u2019s eye has become only more acute the further she has moved from the neighbourhood of her birth. \u201cShe is now a semi-outsider spending half her time living in the States and half in London,\u201d says Alex Clark, artistic director of the Bath Literature Festival. \u201cBut there\u2019s no element of tourism in her writing; instead she retains an enormous affinity with the place she grew up in.\u201d</p> <p>It helps, perhaps, that just as London is both the consummate insider\u2019s city and still a place where outsiders can flourish (just about), so Smith, now 41, is an elegant literary insider who retains an outsider\u2019s eye. She has talked before of having once had two voices \u2013 the voice of her childhood and the voice she assumed on going to Cambridge \u2013 and how she \u201cshould have kept both alive in my mouth\u201d. Instead the voice of her past is constantly re-imagined in her work.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s one of those writers who goes back to the same patch over and over again and that creates a connection,\u201d says Clark. \u201cThe world she\u2019s describing, where new generations of different kinds of people came into an area and lived together in a relatively central part of London, is disappearing, and her work reflects that, both her fiction and her non-fiction.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps because of that her most recent writing is less optimistic about the city she loves. In a typically acute essay on Brexit for the <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/08/18/fences-brexit-diary/\"><em>New York Review of Books</em></a>, she challenged the notion that London stands fearlessly alone. \u201cI kept reading pieces by Londoners speaking proudly of their multicultural, outward-looking city, so different from these narrow xenophobic places up north.

  "<h2>Latin America<br></h2> <p>Governments have often preferred Republican presidential candidates because they historically put an emphasis on free trade, but this time, politicians and commentators are lining up to express doubts about Donald Trump, who has alarmed many with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">dismissive comments about Latinos</a>, plans to build a wall on the Mexican border, and his unpredictable behaviour.</p> <p>Dem\u00e9trio Magnoli, a sociologist and prominent voice of Brazil\u2019s \u201cnew right\u201d, said a Trump victory would be a geopolitical earthquake. \u201cTrump is the closest the US has gotten to fascism. You would have an American president that is nationalist and nativist and we would see mass deportations, and a wall being built, which is likely since he will most likely not deport 11 million people.\u201d</p> <p>He predicted this would force Mexico to turn more towards Latin America and could upset free trade agreements and hurt economic growth.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is so unpredictable and politically inexperienced. We have no idea what he will do, but he seems authoritarian, sexist and contemptuous about Latinos,\u201d said Violeta Granera, of the opposition alliance in Nicaragua.</p> <p>By comparison, Hillary Clinton is seen as a safe pair of hands who is likely to continue the relatively benign policies of the Obama administration.</p> <p>Carlos Lins da Silva, a senior consultant for the S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation, said US regional policies were unlikely to see a major change, but added: \u201cThe election of Trump would \u2013 at least in the short term \u2013 cause dramatic impacts on the international system \u2026 if he puts into practice some of the programmes he is advocating. Brazil won\u2019t come away unscathed. For example, if he makes the entrance of Muslim people more difficult, builds a wall between Mexico and the US, has Nato members pay for US defence, encourages Japan to have a nuclear bomb, gets tougher on Nafta and other free trade deals. All of these ideas would have negative consequences for many countries.</p> <p>Diplomats said they did not expect a major shift in Washington\u2019s Latin American policy regardless of the outcome.</p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton knows Brazil better than Trump, as she has been here before and knows people here, but there will not be any substantial change in relations either way because external relations with South America are a low priority for the US,\u201d said Rubens Barbosa, former Brazilian ambassador to Washington.</p> <p>The country with most at stake may be Cuba, which has enjoyed a reconciliation with the US under Barack Obama. Former Cuban president Fidel Castro weighed in with an article last month in the <em>Granma</em> newspaper in which he awarded Trump \u201cthe medal of mud\u201d, but the old revolutionary also had nothing good to say about the Democrats.</p> <h2>Middle East<br></h2> <p>Trump outraged the Arab world with his comments on Muslim immigration \u2013 and regional public opinion certainly reflects this. A survey of 3,017 people in the Middle East and North Africa found that \u2013 if they had a vote \u2013 half would snub both Trump and Clinton.</p> <p>On the fight against Islamic State, Clinton has pledged to never send troops back to Iraq, and ruled out boots on the ground in Syria. Trump has been less specific about his plan to fight Isis, but said in March that the US has \u201cno choice\u201d but to send 20,000 to 30,000 combat troops to the region.</p> <p>In the survey, from the Jeddah-based daily <em>Arab News</em> and pollsters YouGov, 46% said the US should send troops to fight Isis and collaborate closely with Russia on Syria. The rest did not want a US presence on the ground but did feel that Washington should be more involved in the humanitarian efforts for Syrian refugees, arm moderate groups and increase air strikes on Isis. Clinton was most popular, with 78% saying she would be the best for the Arab world.</p> <p>On the candidates\u2019 policies, Arab opinion is much more balanced. Clinton\u2019s stance on climate change and US Israel policy found strong support in the poll. But Arabs overwhelmingly back Trump\u2019s stance on abortion and, ironically perhaps, border controls.</p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/trump-putin-senate-republicans-marco-rubio-john-mccain\">was thrust into an unexpected starring role in this election,</a> and whatever the result, it will please the Kremlin that it has been able to cause so much mischief. How much of this was down to direct Kremlin meddling, we will perhaps never know, although the state media\u2019s bias towards Trump has been fairly clear.</p> <p>Most Russian analysts believe the US is systemically set up to oppose Russia, and while there is an understanding that Trump is an unusual candidate, many believe a Trump presidency would not change things much. Other more sober heads are well aware that for all Trump\u2019s friendly rhetoric, as president he would be a much more unpredictable quantity than Clinton, the devil they know.</p> <p>To go on the public rhetoric alone, the casual observer would think the Russian establishment is banking on Trump. Russian television has been giving airtime to many of Trump\u2019s claims that the election could be rigged, but this is as much to help discredit the US system in the eyes of viewers as it is sincere backing for Trump. He has been backed not because of his politics, but because he is the chaos candidate; in the same way Russia was also keen on Brexit. Even if Clinton wins, Russia knows that after this divisive campaign, US democracy is in for a period of soul-searching which will leave less energy and focus for meeting external threats.</p> <h2>Africa</h2> <p>If Africa has barely featured in the campaign, then the continent has, in part, returned the compliment. But though many experts believe the result may not imply any drastic change in US policies in Africa, there is still widespread anxiety and Trump has already alienated many, particularly with his apparently racist rhetoric.</p> <p>\u201cFew Africans are putting any store on Trump if he wins the election, that is if he remembers we exist once he\u2019s done with Mexicans and illegal immigrants,\u201d wrote Gitau Warigi, in Kenya\u2019s <em>Daily Nation</em>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s call for a ban on Muslims entering the US received widespread coverage and provoked outrage. The Somalia-based Islamic militant group, al-Shabaab, included a clip of Trump proposing the temporary ban in one of its recruiting videos.</p> <p>The tycoon does have supporters. <a href=\"http://www.wingia.com/web/files/richeditor/filemanager/WINGIA_Global_Poll_on_US_Election_-_FINALIZED_Revised_Global_Press_Release.pdf\">Although a poll </a>in Nigeria found that 77% would vote Clinton and only 19% Trump, while in South Africa the proportion was 59% to 15%, some African commentators see Trump as an anti-establishment candidate of a sort they would welcome: one who could disrupt an unjust status quo.</p> <p>\u201cThe world and nations don\u2019t reform when they are comfortable. They only do so when they are afraid or have been severely injured \u2026 <a href=\"http://www.africareview.com/opinion/Bring-on-Donald-Trump-he-will-change-our-rotten-ways-/979188-3184656-rs3h5n/index.html\">bring on Trump</a>,\u201d wrote Charles Onyango-Obbo, a Kenyan publisher and columnist.</p> <p>However, neither candidate has given any real clues to their attitude on Africa. On trade, there is speculation that Trump\u2019s support for greater protection of US industries could mean higher tariffs that would <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/news/world/Africa-unsure-how-a-post-Obama-regime-will-treat-Agoa/1068-3434786-x65cxy/index.html\">damage some African economies</a>, local analysts say. Nearly 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa can export goods to the US duty-free under legislation from 2000. In some, the regime has served as a catalyst for industrial production.</p> <p>On aid, there are fears for the funding of projects to prevent and treat HIV and Aids which have helped millions. Clinton is seen as backing continued, or enhanced, public health assistance.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s allegations of vote rigging in the US have prompted strong reactions in a continent where manipulation of electoral process is widespread.</p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump is a gift to all tin-pot dictators on the African continent. He is giving currency and legitimacy to rigging because if it can exist in America, it can exist anywhere,\u201d Zimbabwean opposition leader Tendai Biti told Reuters news agency last week. However, it is a fake quote which has caused the biggest stir. Trump has been widely reported to have pledged to \u201clock up\u201d both Robert Mugabe, the veteran president of Zimbabwe, and Museveni. The false comment was not questioned and prompted anger, hope, ridicule, excitement and hilarity \u2013 as well as a small demonstration of support in Uganda where five protesters waved placards outside the US embassy.</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>A new video by German comedian Jan B\u00f6hmermann was released last week, entitled Grab US by the Pussy. It waxes lyrical about the foreign policy that Washington might pursue if Trump were in the White House.</p> <p>\u201cWe like the new spirit of your nation / Let\u2019s walk hand in hand into isolation\u201d goes one of the lines.</p> <p>In reality, the majority of Germans view the prospect of a Republican victory on Tuesday with fear. Some 65% of respondents in a YouGov survey released last week said that they were afraid of such an outcome. If Germans could vote, a poll by the magazine <em>Stern</em> found that only 5% would cast their vote for Trump.</p> <p>In political circles, Germany\u2019s biggest concerns relate to how much damage a Trump presidency would do to the transatlantic alliance. The US is the key contributor to the UN budget and has the highest military budget within Nato, yet during his campaign Trump has described Nato as \u201cobsolete\u201d and indicated that he would, at the very least, seek to renegotiate its framework.</p> <p>If the Republican wins and lives up to his own words, Germany and France would, after Brexit, be the two countries expected to try to fill the geopolitical vacuum in Europe. Hope remains that Trump\u2019s rhetoric would prove more dramatic than his actions.</p> <p>\u201cIn Berlin government circles,\u201d <em>Der Spiegel</em> recently wrote, \u201cofficials are more concerned about Trump\u2019s character than the radical political about-face he might introduce.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A lot has happened since Nicholas Stern, then a permanent secretary at the Treasury, produced his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/30/economy.uk\" title=\"\">landmark review</a> of the impact of climate change 10 years ago. His work was quickly recognised as the definitive account of the economic dangers posed to the planet by global warming.</p> <p>Since then, global temperatures have risen to record levels. Arctic summer sea ice has continued to shrink, as have many major land-based ice sheets. Carbon dioxide is being pumped into the atmosphere in ever-increasing amounts. At the same time, low-lying coastal areas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/11/miami-drowning-climate-change-deniers-sea-levels-rising\" title=\"\">such as south Florida </a>and parts of Bangladesh, are experiencing more and more flooding as sea levels have risen. Scientists have begun to link extreme weather events to the planet\u2019s changing climate, while animal and plant species are gradualling moving towards the poles. So, a decade on, is Stern plunged in despair over our prospects? Not quite. While the picture is certainly grim, the world\u2019s top climate economist still believes there are grounds for modest optimism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/30/economy.uk\">Stern report: the key points</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have been too slow in acting on climate change,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cIn particular, we have delayed the curbing of greenhouse gas emissions for far too long. When we published our review, emissions were equivalent to the pumping of 40-41bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere a year. Today there are around 50bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. At the same time, science is telling us that impacts of global warming \u2013 like ice sheet and glacier melting \u2013 are now happening much more quickly than we anticipated.\u201d</p> <p>In his report, published in October 2006, Stern warned that the cost of inaction would be far greater for future generations than the costs of actions taken today. \u201cWith hindsight, I now realise that I underestimated the risks. I should have been much stronger in what I said in the report about the costs of inaction. I underplayed the dangers.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/11/miami-drowning-climate-change-deniers-sea-levels-rising\">Miami, the great world city, is drowning while the powers that be look away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These are stark remarks. Yet the dramatic success of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-paris-climate-summit-and-un-talks\" title=\"\">Paris climate talks</a> last year, and their subsequent rapid ratification by more than 90 countries, has provided the 70-year-old economist with a sense of hope: \u201cIt has taken only 11 months to get the Paris agreement ratified. It took eight years to get its predecessor, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/11/kyoto-protocol\" title=\"\">Kyoto protocol</a>, into force. So in a sense, the last 12 months have been encouraging.\u201d</p> <p>In his review, Stern made a cogent case for the need to make drastic reductions in fossil fuel burning to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, which are heating our atmosphere dangerously. The costs involved \u2013 in investing in the development of alternative energy sources, for example \u2013 would be far outweighed by the costs of coping with an overheated world afflicted by flooding, soaring temperatures, ruined crops and farmland, lack of food and displaced people, he argued. Most experts responded positively to the review.</p> <p>Yet the world is still burning more and more fossil fuel and pumping more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This has both long- and short-term consequences. \u201cApart from raising carbon levels and temperatures, burning fossil fuels causes air pollution, as we have learned over the past five years,\u201d says Stern. \u201cThe consequences are terrible. Air pollution kills more than 30,000 people a year in Britain. That is about one in 2,000 of the population. It has become one of the very big killers around the world. In China, it causes about 4,000 deaths a day.</p> <p>\u201cWe are killing millions every year from air pollution produced by burning fossil fuels. Yes, there are other sources of air pollution but burning fossil fuels is a large part of the story. That understanding is new and very important.\u201d</p> <p>As a counterbalance, Stern points to the fact that in recent years there has been an encouraging increase in the use of sustainable technologies that should help us to wean us of our fossil fuel dependency. Cities like Barcelona and Bogot\u00e1 have made themselves cleaner and healthier. Coal burning has peaked in China. Hybrid cars and electric vehicles are being sold in increasing numbers and the cost of making solar panels has been reduced by a factor of 20. \u201cWe have reached the point where we can now see that the alternative route is not really something that should be regarded as a cost. It is actually a much better way of doing things, even if you had never heard of climate change,\u201d says Stern.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30bd22c4c7167d0e62590bf46332af0d6b3eda51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30bd22c4c7167d0e62590bf46332af0d6b3eda51/81_0_1263_758/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heathrow\u2019s third runway could be incompatible with the Paris climate targets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heathrow\u2019s third runway could be incompatible with the Paris climate targets, says Stern.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the message has taken too long to sink in, and as result we are approaching a crunch point, he argues. In the next 20 years, as economies across the globe expand, the planet is likely to build infrastructure \u2013 roads, buildings, ports and airports \u2013 that will more than double what already exists.</p> <p>The crucial issue is the nature of that infrastructure. \u201cIf it is dirty and high carbon, it will lock us into that technology for a long time. We will be sentenced to live in cities where we cannot breath or move or be productive. If we do it using sustainable technology, however, we could have an extremely attractive future where you have strong growth, poverty is reduced, cities are cleaner and forests are saved. People have not sufficiently understood the importance of the next 20 years. They are going to be the most decisive two decades in human history.\u201d</p> <p>Last year\u2019s Paris climate deal suggests there is a will to avoid the worst and there is a prospect of further strong agreements being reached at this month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/02/indigenous-rights-forests-climate-change-study\" title=\"\">talks in Marrakech</a>. India, China and the US have all made positive noises. Hillary Clinton is a firm supporter of climate change initiatives \u2013 but what if Donald Trump is elected president? This is a man who has claimed the concept of global warming was created \u201cby and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing noncompetitive\u201d and who has pledged to tear up the Paris agreement. Stern\u2019s response is diplomatic: \u201cIt would make things very much more difficult,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4449f4300daebd53d35c82d6cdf10fea8f195771\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4449f4300daebd53d35c82d6cdf10fea8f195771/0_241_3404_2043/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plane takes off\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The UK could still cut its carbon emissions from aircraft by 80% by 2050 \u2013 if there is a major improvement in aviation technology.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Closer to home, Stern says he is confident the government understands the importance of adhering to its commitments to reduce UK carbon emissions by at least 80% by 2050 \u2013 despite the \u201cpolicy wobbles\u201d of the previous administration. David Cameron pledged his would be the greenest government ever but ended up cutting support for solar panels on homes, killing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-deal\" title=\"\">Green Deal</a> to help people insulate old homes, scrapping green building standards for new homes and cutting support for industrial solar projects. \u201cTo behave in an unpredictable way, as the government did last year, is to be really damaging to investment,\u201d says Stern. \u201cThat is why it was worrying. But I am hopeful, though I cannot be sure, that the new administration will take a more balanced and predictable approach. It should certainly be at the core of the new government\u2019s industrial strategy and I will be looking for hints of that in the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/25/heathrow-third-runway-davies-commission\" title=\"\">proposed new runway for Heathrow</a> is a more complex issue, however. Analysis suggests the country could just about deal with the extra emissions produced by the additional planes, and still cut its carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 \u2013 if there is a major improvement in aviation technology. This would involve developing more efficient engines, better biofuels and lighter planes. \u201cHowever, that commitment to reduce emissions by 80% was made in order to hold global temperature rises to 2C. The Paris climate deal suggested we should be more ambitious and go for a 1.5C limit. That means that if the UK\u2019s targets are altered \u2013 as I believe they should be \u2013 to reflect the Paris agreement, there is now a question about whether we can have that extra runway and the extra carbon emissions it will generate. We need to check again if it is manageable,\u201d adds Stern.</p> <p>The Paris agreement remains central to Stern\u2019s sense of cautious optimism. \u201cIt was the honesty of the delegates\u2019 awareness of the nature of the problem and the speed of the agreement\u2019s ratification that has given me most hope. We have a lot to do to limit carbon emissions to an effective level. I am confident that it is possible to achieve that, though I cannot say that I am confident it will happen.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As the markets tremble, the polls tighten, the bookies scramble to adjust the odds, and the US presidential race enters its final, frantic days, the rhetoric \u2013 from the president down \u2013 grows more hysterical by the hour. If we are to believe Barack Obama, the fate of the civilised world hangs in the balance as America faces an imminent electoral apocalypse after the \u201cdirtiest campaign ever\u201d.</p> <p>To the uninitiated, the Donald Trump insurgency must look like the nadir of democracy, more about \u201cpussy\u201d than politics. How, you might ask, could a powerful, multi-ethnic country, where women voters outnumber men by several million, seriously consider electing a man whose name is synonymous with xenophobia, racism and misogyny?

It too was held on 8 November.</p> <p>Trump may have plumbed the depths of vulgarity, sleaze and pig-ignorance, but he is anticipated by the politics of the 1850s, in the decade before Abraham Lincoln\u2019s presidency. Not many now remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/18/donald-trump-immigration-know-nothing-dangerous-republicans\" title=\"\">Millard Fillmore</a> or his supporters, the self-styled \u201cKnow Nothings\u201d, but these wild patriots, the forefathers of the angry white males who chant \u201clock her up\u201d, prefigure many aspects of the Trump campaign, promising to \u201cpurify\u201d American politics.</p> <p>The Know Nothings exploited popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by immigrants, who were seen as enemies of the republic and, more sinister still, controlled by the pope. The party was most active from 1854 to 1856 and had a champion in Fillmore (one of the worst US presidents). <a href=\"http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/speed.htm\" title=\"\">Lincoln himself wrote</a> to a friend, \u201cI am not a Know Nothing. How could I be? \u2026 Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid.

At least he did not, as Aaron Burr did in 1804, actually fight a duel with one of his political adversaries. Burr, who was Thomas Jefferson\u2019s vice-president at the time, mortally wounded Alexander Hamilton, and charged with murder had to flee to safety in the south.</p> <p>Rhetorically, the mudslinging inspired by Jefferson\u2019s two successful campaigns for the presidency was often as ugly as anything heard on the stump with Trump and \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d. In the 1800 presidential election, Jefferson fought John Adams, whose supporters charged that Jefferson was a godless libertine in thrall to the French. This election was said to have been \u201cone of the most acrimonious in the annals of American history\u201d.</p> <p>More than 200 years later, many commentators believe that the US system is broken. But it has seemed broken before and somehow staggers on. From some points of view, the ferocity of Trump v Clinton is evidence of vigour not breakdown. However, some observers are wondering if the shock that would reform the system might destroy it.</p>"
