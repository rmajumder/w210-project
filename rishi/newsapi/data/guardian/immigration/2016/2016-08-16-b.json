The camp is not safer, conditions have not improved, the physical and mental decline of those held continues.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte Wilson, who worked in case management on both Nauru and Manus Island over a period of 1.5 years, said \u201cThe Nauru files are damning in their truth, and they are not exclusive to Nauru. The men on Manus are being harmed just as frequently and severely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI watched these children\u2019s lives being destroyed by these camps,\u201d said Katie Price, Former Child and Youth Recreation Officer, was employed on Nauru with Save the Children for almost two years. \u201cThey went from energetic, cheeky, normal kids to completely devoid of all emotion. I recall one 7-year-old child towards the end having a complete breakdown. She collapsed, screaming and kicking and crying for 20 minutes, completely incoherent and would not let go of me. \u201c</p> <p>Shivani Keecha, who was the Coordinator of Save the Children\u2019s Child Protection team on Nauru until October 2015, wants to see immediate action taken. \u201cThis cannot continue. I worked on Nauru while several previous investigations and inquiries were held. Nothing changed. It was already too little too late. We don\u2019t need more evidence. We know these centres cause unacceptable harm. We need to bring these people to Australia and start the process of rebuilding their lives.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>Hayley Ballinger, Unaccompanied Minor Residential Worker and Child Protection Caseworker with Save the Children until April 2015 said \u201cI implore the public and the Government to remember these are people. Kind, ambitious, strong, imaginative, clever, nurturing, loving, real people who are being systemically broken.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey are truly the bravest souls I have ever met, and they deserve a future free from further harm.\u201d said Ms Ballinger.</p> <p>Chris Lougheed, Deputy Education Manager with Save the Children, who personally reviewed and submitted a great many incident reports such as those published in the Nauru files, condemned the Minister\u2019s claims that the reports were \u2018hype\u2019 and demanded he took responsibility. \u201cThese reports are accurate observations written by experienced professionals.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople are in immediate danger. Too much time has already passed. The Australian government must take responsibility and bring them here immediately.\u201d said Mr Lougheed.</p>",

It has been amended since its original passing, but <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-9847.html#0-0-0-399\">Section 313</a>, which bans members of the Communist party, remains.</p> <p>There are a few exceptions which would allow a member of the Communist party to become a citizen despite their affiliation. The exceptions listed on the USCIS website include: if their membership was involuntary or they lacked \u201cawareness of the nature or the aims of the organization\u201d; if the membership was ended before the age of 16, or 10 years prior to applying for citizenship; or if the membership was used to get a job, food or other essentials.</p> <p>\u201cThe burden rests on the applicant to prove that he or she has an attachment to the Constitution and that he or she is well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States,\u201d the site notes.<br></p> <p>As one blog pointed out, the continued existence of this restriction may disproportionately affect immigrants from China, where membership in the Communist party is popular. \u201cDid you think the Cold War was over?\u201d immigration lawyer Gary Chodorow <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://lawandborder.com/communist-party-members-ineligible-green-card/\">wrote</a>.</p>",

They divert attention away from much needed analysis of how US domestic and foreign policies in the past four decades have been in great part responsible for the violence these shows decry.</p> <p>So far, documentaries about Blanco, aka the Cocaine Godmother, conform to this standard; routinely using racial and gender stereotypes, and littering unchecked facts that reproduce the mythology surrounding her life. They play out like this: she committed her first murder when she was 11 years old, she owned jewelry that once belonged to Eva Per\u00f3n, she was fond of cocaine-fueled orgies with both men and women, and she was inherently ruthless. This last trait has been heralded as her trademark; controversial investigative journalist Gerald Posner took it to the extreme by saying that Blanco \u201c<a href=\"http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/gerald-posner-back-in-the-limelight-in-biography-channels-griselda-blanco-doc-6525218\">did not have DNA for sympathy</a>\u201d.</p> <p>By overly focusing on dubious personal anecdotes with little or no corroboration, the vital details of the story get lost.

Shows like Narcos have helped promote the idea that the presence of cocaine in the streets of Miami and the violence related to it constitutes an invasion perpetrated by foreign \u2013 and evil \u2013 agents. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65a0ed896870c2dbd4a8998427db13e33956d9b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65a0ed896870c2dbd4a8998427db13e33956d9b0/23_88_1168_701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar in Narcos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar in Narcos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With subtitles and a purported adherence to historical rigor, Narcos lured audiences eager for a sense of cultural weight. But instead of promoting understanding and cultural nuance, these shows change facts to suit their North American audiences and focus on making them feel good about themselves. The cinematography and the music are cool; they think they\u2019re learning about foreign cultures; the women are sexy; and they get to be both the victims and the heroes of the story. </p> <p>In the current political climate, this is particularly pernicious. The notion that the complicated challenges that the US is facing have been brought to the homeland by dangerous and irrational others is being skillfully mobilized by politicians.</p> <p>The stories of Escobar and Blanco present an opportunity. Like Pablo Escobar, Griselda Blanco\u2019s story has much to say about issues relevant to the US today, such as the unintended consequences of foreign policy for national security, the dramatic effects of racial and income inequality in the rise of violence and crime, and lessons about how the inability \u2013 or unwillingness \u2013 of the system to deal with addiction as a disease rather a crime has led to the overpopulation of prisons, while consumption rates continue to soar.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/17/narcos-netflix-colombian-accents\">Narcos is a hit for Netflix but iffy accents grate on Colombian ears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If thoughtfully addressed, Blanco\u2019s story could also provide great insight about how the criminalization and persecution of specific substances and communities, fueled by racism and xenophobia, tends to engender worse evils that the ones it seeks to eradicate.</p> <p>This approach is not just a pipe-dream. An accomplished Latina actor will not only play Blanco\u2019s role but also will be the executive director of the film. Female characters tend to conform to one of two tropes associated with Latino women in popular culture and mass media: the innocent victim in need of salvation by a male protagonist, or the seductive and violent temptress, the narco femme-fatale. This is further ironic because many of these stories claim to denounce the machismo of Latino drug lords while remaining unaware of, or unbothered by, their own structural sexism. </p> <p>Hopefully, under Lopez\u2019s leadership the film will avoid this and other common pitfalls of narco-storytelling, providing relief from another vicious circle: that of a society that one the hand declares a war on those who supply a product for which it is the main market, and on the other hand turns this violence into profitable and easily digestible cultural commodities that \u2013 like cocaine \u2013 are eagerly consumed with little or no regard for the ethical quandaries embedded in the political economy of its production.</p> <p><em>Juliana Mart\u00ednez is an assistant professor of world languages and cultures at American University, Washington DC</em></p>",
  "<p>In his major policy speech on foreign policy delivered yesterday in the battleground state of Ohio, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump finally made it clear who exactly should be barred from the United States: himself.</p> <p>The candidate plainly stated that \u201cthose who do not believe in our constitution, or who support bigotry and hatred, will not be admitted for immigration into the country\u201d. Since Trump, who is known to have expressed bigoted and hateful opinions about Mexicans and Muslims, and who has repeatedly demonstrated a tenuous grasp of the constitution, already resides in the United States, I assume he will opt for Mitt Romney-style self-deportation.</p> <p>Obviously, I\u2019m being sarcastic. But not that sarcastic, to be honest with you.</p> <p>We have become accustomed now to hearing a new version of Trump\u2019s Muslim ban almost every time the candidate opens his mouth on the issue, but we should remember that his proposal was born out of politics and not principle. In December 2015, rival candidate Ted Cruz was stealing Trump\u2019s thunder by saying the US was now \u201cat war\u201d because of the San Bernardino attacks. Trump had to one-up his competition, so he proposed a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering this country\u201d, and everyone forgot about Cruz for the moment.</p> <p>Then, after the public debated the constitutionality of a religion-based ban, Trump later announced that he would instead \u201csuspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe, or our allies\u201d. Are we to assume that Trump isn\u2019t opposed to terrorism per se but only terrorism against the US and its friends?</p> <p>And by July, he stated that he would bar entry to those coming from \u201cterritories and terror states and terror nations\u201d, whatever that means. In the intervening months, as the website <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/\">thinkprogress.org</a> has <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/gops-attempt-to-soften-trump-s-language-on-a-muslim-ban-derailed-by-trump-himself-74beba29977b#.8wnlw5wxp\">pointed</a> out, he has exempted from the ban his own friends who are Muslim, Muslim Americans in the military, Muslim world leaders and Muslim athletes. Trump\u2019s Muslim ban has been remixed almost as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01sn5gv\">often</a> as Change the Beat by Fab 5 Freddy.</p> <p>The latest version of this failed immigration policy has Trump tilting back to the days of the cold war. Proposing an \u201cideological screening test\u201d, Trump now says that his program of \u201cextreme vetting\u201d will screen out those who \u201cdo not share our values and respect our people\u201d. Going further than his past proposals, Trump now demands we bar those \u201cwho have hostile attitudes towards our country or its principles \u2013 or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to take any of this seriously. Trump is proposing that the freedoms of immigrants, and especially Muslims, entering this country be curtailed to the point that they cannot hold \u201chostile attitudes\u201d. But who is to decide when an attitude is hostile enough to warrant exclusion? Do we really expect the authorities to patrol not only our borders but also our thoughts? Does Donald Trump, of all people, not realize that you might say contradictory things about any given topic just to get ahead?</p> <p>Trump\u2019s precedent for this absurdity is the old McCarran-Walter Act of 1952, which sought to ban communist thought from the country, but which ended up keeping such notable people as Nobel-prize winning novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez, French actor Yves Montand and Canadian politician Pierre Elliot Trudeau from crossing our borders.</p> <p>\u201cIt made us look to the rest of the world like a people other than the people we are\u201d is how the late US senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan characterized the policy. \u201cIt misrepresented America. It said we\u2019re afraid of ideas, can\u2019t handle them, don\u2019t like people speaking their minds. That\u2019s not who we are at all.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s unworkable policy proposal will further alienate Muslims around the world because it tells them they are guilty until they can prove to him they are innocent. It also insults all immigrants by policing their thoughts and beliefs and every citizen by suggesting we can\u2019t think for ourselves. For a man who says he bravely stands up to \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d, Donald Trump seems awfully ready to enshrine it into law. </p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump may be the only presidential candidate in history to think that the era of the cold war and Senator Joseph McCarthy\u2019s communist witch-hunts is something to emulate. On Monday, he expanded his anti-terror policy \u2013 which has included a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d of America\u2019s borders to Muslims \u2013 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/donald-trump-immigration-test-isis-islamic-state-foreign-policy\">calling for a revival</a> of McCarthyism. \u201cIn the cold war we had an ideological screening test ... The time is overdue for a new test. I call it extreme vetting,\u201d he said in his speech.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just McCarthy that Trump is channeling. Sadly, America has a long history of reactionary anti-immigrant attitudes, and if Trump were to be successful, he would revive some of the worst policies in our country\u2019s history.<br></p> <p>The founding fathers saw the value in opening America\u2019s borders. Among the litany of complaints against King George III in the <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html\">Declaration of Independence</a>, one grievance was that the king had \u201cendeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither.\u201d<br></p> <p>Alexander Hamilton \u2013 an immigrant himself \u2013 <a href=\"http://what-when-how.com/the-american-economy/report-on-the-subject-of-manufactures-1791/\">was eager</a> to \u201copen every possible [avenue to] emigration from abroad\u201d, seeing only the benefit for labor and manufacturing. His rival Thomas Jefferson wasn\u2019t so sure. While Jefferson <a href=\"http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/jefferson/ch08.html\">noted</a> that migrants who came of their own accord should be \u201centitled to all the rights of citizenship\u201d, he cautioned the US to be wary of too much immigration. Jefferson feared that many immigrants, coming from countries ruled by \u201cabsolute monarchies\u201d, wouldn\u2019t be able to adjust to democracy, and he worried such people would have the effect of turning his home state of Virginia into \u201ca heterogeneous, incoherent, distracted mass\u201d.<br></p> <p>Sound familiar? Well, let\u2019s not brand Trump a Jeffersonian quite yet. After all, it was also <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html\">Jefferson who called for</a> a \u201cwall of separation between church &amp; state\u201d, and who was a <a href=\"http://religionandpolitics.org/2014/04/09/thomas-jeffersons-quran/\">student of the Qu\u2019ran</a>. His friend James Madison, an architect of the US constitution, similarly <a href=\"http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions49.html\">argued:</a> \u201cFreedom arises from [a] multiplicity of sects, which pervades America ... For where there is such a variety of sects, there cannot be a majority of any one sect to oppress and persecute the rest.\u201d<br></p> <p>As it turned out, immigration wasn\u2019t much of a political factor in the first decades of America\u2019s history as only a few thousand people came to America each year. Then, with the famine following the failure of the potato crop in Ireland in 1845 \u2013 along with a series of failed revolutions in Germany, Poland, Hungary and elsewhere in 1848 \u2013 America\u2019s immigrant population grew rapidly.

A major political party, the Know-Nothings or Nativist Party, was formed on an anti-immigrant platform. By 1856, the Know-Nothings were running former president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/18/donald-trump-immigration-know-nothing-dangerous-republicans\">Millard Fillmore</a> as their candidate, promising that \u201c<a href=\"http://www.yale.edu/glc/archive/974.htm\">Americans must rule America</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Chinese immigration had accelerated on the west coast, and many Chinese found themselves the objects of cultural, racial and economic enmity. This led, in 1882, to the first and only law the US has ever passed essentially banning a specific nationality: <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1866-1898/chinese-immigration\">the Chinese Exclusion Act</a>. The original law placed a 10-year moratorium on Chinese immigration and required those in the US to carry the proper papers or risk deportation. </p> <p>The act wasn\u2019t repealed until 1943, when having China as an ally against Japan was more important than immigration law; however, by that point, the 1924 Naturalization Act had made it difficult for any foreigners to come to the US. That law, aimed at curbing Italian and eastern European migration, established a quota system that wasn\u2019t abolished until 1965.</p> <p>The start of the cold war saw Americans focused on a more insidious enemy: communists. Because communism was an ideology, not an easily recognizable ethnicity, Senator McCarthy and the far-right John Birch Society saw potential \u201creds\u201d everywhere. Catching a few high-profile spies (such as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg) only added to the general paranoia \u2013 much as attacks like those in San Bernadino and Orlando fuel concerns about domestic terrorism today.<br></p> <p>McCarthy wasn\u2019t alone. It was Harry Truman that first instituted <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/truman-orders-loyalty-checks-of-federal-employees\">federal loyalty oaths</a> in 1947, and it was Dwight Eisenhower who had \u201cunder God\u201d added to the pledge of allegiance to separate Americans from <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/28/us/with-little-ado-congress-put-god-in-pledge-in-1954.html\">godless communists</a>. It is true that there were actual Soviet spies in America, just as there are terrorists here today. They just weren\u2019t lurking around every corner or infiltrating every government office.<br></p> <p>It is easy to dismiss Donald Trump. Nearly everything that comes out his mouth is absurd (sorry, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/isis-donald-trump-stumbles-over-sarcasm\">sarcasm</a>\u201d). But when <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-proposes-extreme-vetting-immigrants-ideological-screening/story?id=41392682\">he says</a>: \u201cWe must also screen out any who have hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles,\u201d he is not an outlier. Jefferson could easily have said something very similar.<br></p> <p>When Trump goes on to note that \u201cto put these new procedures in place, we will have to temporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world\u201d, he is unfortunately upholding a long American tradition.<br></p> <p>This isn\u2019t to say he\u2019s correct: America\u2019s greatest strength is its diversity, and as Hamilton rightly argued, immigrants are the backbone of the country\u2019s economy.

As soon as the pair\u2019s first show aired three weeks ago, tabloid journalists were trawling Twitter for negative reviews, and found quite a few: \u201cunwatchable\u201d was one word used. \u201cDo these presenters hate each other? I\u2019m sensing some serious awkwardness,\u201d wrote <a href=\"https://twitter.com/charlottestarz/status/758983201846996992\" title=\"\">another</a>.</p> <p>So do they get on? \u201cHe\u2019s brilliant. I get him \u2013 he\u2019s a dour, straight-talking, self-made Yorkshireman,\u201d says Rani. \u201cHe\u2019s hardworking and ambitious, and that makes sense to me. There was nothing for me to not get on with.\u201d As for chemistry, you\u2019ve either got it or you haven\u2019t, but the best TV relationships grow over time. They only met for the first time over lunch on a Monday; by that Friday they were presenting the show. Rani says she doesn\u2019t \u201clike to look at negative reviews, I don\u2019t Google my name to see what people are saying. I read Twitter if [I\u2019m directly mentioned] and there are a couple of people saying: \u2018She doesn\u2019t let him get a word in edgeways.\u2019 I question if they would be saying that if it was the other way around, if the man was doing the talking.\u201d</p> <p>Did it shake her confidence? \u201cNo. I\u2019ve been working in this industry for ages, and I\u2019ve always been under the radar. This last year has just exploded, so I suppose people are paying more attention. As long as I know I\u2019m doing the best job, I\u2019m enjoying it, and if the bosses are happy, I\u2019m happy. Of course, everybody wants to be liked, but it\u2019s fine for people to not like me; you can\u2019t please everybody.\u201d</p> <p>Rani was described by one TV reviewer as \u201crelentless perky\u201d, and it\u2019s true that she is the most positive, cheerful person I\u2019ve met in a very long time. We meet in a cafe around the corner from her home in Hackney, east London. Hackney is \u201cwonderful; idyllic\u201d, the pastries in the cafe are \u201camazing\u201d, being interviewed for the Guardian is \u201cexciting\u201d. She has been working hard since she graduated with a degree in broadcast journalism and now. at the age of 38, she says it feels as if the planets have aligned and it\u2019s all coming together. She is emerging as one of the country\u2019s favourite TV presenters. I can imagine how her irrepressible sunniness might grate with some, but I find it refreshing in the midst of doom, gloom and snark. Her documentary on the Za\u2019atari refugee camp was pretty Pollyanna-ish, with its weddings and bakers, but it succeeded in humanising the camp\u2019s desperate inhabitants. Gruff farmers on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006t0bv\" title=\"\">Countryfile</a> are no match for her cheer.</p> <p>There have been attempts to funnel her into other areas. \u201cLots of people have asked me throughout my entire career to do news. It\u2019s something that gets suggested but I always said when I started working in television that I think the world needs to see that Asian women have personalities and a sense of humour and can be fun.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91f371d32a336a18950264504d1e248c1dc636ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91f371d32a336a18950264504d1e248c1dc636ce/102_67_4317_2591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rani with This Morning co-presenter, James Martin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rani with This Morning co-presenter, James Martin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rani is one of very few British Asian female presenters on television, especially on primetime shows with reach (Sunday night\u2019s Countryfile, for instance, pulls in more than nine million viewers each week). Why are there still so few women of colour in presenting roles? \u201cI think it\u2019s two-fold. You need producers and directors and people behind the scenes to make the changes.\u201d In meetings, and on shoots, \u201cI\u2019m often the only northerner, no matter anything else. I\u2019m often the only woman, and definitely the only Asian. People who have the privileged position of being able to give other people jobs need to be able to see beyond themselves. I\u2019ve always thought that, if I ran a TV company, I\u2019d want it to be the most creative space ever, and the only way to do that is to get people from the most diverse backgrounds. Why you\u2019d want this homogenised group of people makes no sense.\u201d</p> <p>If there have been barriers in her career, she says, \u201cI just choose not to see them or let them worry me. That\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t exist. I see that there are flaws in the system, but I\u2019ll find the cracks. I don\u2019t think about the things that can hold me back. If you\u2019re putting those thoughts into your head, you\u2019re already stopping yourself.\u201d Is she as confident as she seems? She says she\u2019s never worried about getting enough work. \u201cI think I\u2019m a natural risk-taker and I am fearless. I do all the things that women do, like have self-doubt, but when it comes to work I\u2019m more excited about what\u2019s round the corner than worried about what\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>As a child, growing up in Bradford, she remembers watching youth TV programmes with presenters such as Magenta Devine and Sankha Guha and thinking that was what she wanted to do. \u201cMagenta Devine was just cool, different,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd an Asian man \u2013 imagine that, as a kid, seeing a brown face on telly.\u201d At 14, she got a job working on Sunrise, the Asian radio station, and when she was doing her A-levels, a local television channel started in Bradford; she went down the following day and asked if she could help out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"97163881b0baac7c7953e02c3e8dc75a044acfde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97163881b0baac7c7953e02c3e8dc75a044acfde/273_356_2936_1762/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rani with Gleb Savchenko on Strictly Come Dancing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rani with Gleb Savchenko on Strictly Come Dancing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She was one of the few, perhaps the only, Asian girl at her \u201creally nice, white, middle-class school\u201d (the independent Bradford Girl\u2019s Grammar), but she says she never felt very different. \u201cWhen we\u2019d go away or on day trips, Mum would cook Indian food and take it with us. That would mortify me, it was so embarrassing. I just wanted sandwiches. I grew up being taken to India and other stuff that made me really grumpy because all I wanted to do is camp in the south of France like my friends and snog Dutch boys. But now I look back, it\u2019s amazing what my parents gave me. I have this understanding of two worlds.\u201d</p> <p>She says she never experienced \u201cany out-and-out racism\u201d. When a neighbour saw her once wearing traditional Indian clothes, he said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t know you were one of those.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been told: \u2018You\u2019re not like the others,\u2019\u201d she says. It made her happy to hear this as a child, but it only recently dawned on her how offensive that is. \u201cBecause I <em>am</em> like the others, actually. I don\u2019t know what their perception of \u2018the others\u2019 was, what their perception of Asians in Britain was.\u201d</p> <p>Her family were liberal. \u201cI didn\u2019t have this cliched upbringing,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mum and dad just wanted me and my brother to do whatever we wanted to do. It was a cliche in that education was a top priority \u2013 that was fundamental, and they would make sure we studied. But I was always allowed to do stuff. I do remember other Asian girls not having as free a life as me. My dad took me to the pub when I was 15, I don\u2019t know if other Asian girls\u2019 dads did that.\u201d But she is not unique, she stresses: \u201cThere are loads of cool Asian families.\u201d</p> <p>Rani\u2019s parents ran a successful clothing manufacturing business, but lost everything in the recession in the early 90s. Her father became a shop manager and her mother became an interpreter at a local hospital. \u201cThey never let me and my brother feel the pressure of [losing the business]. It\u2019s only now when I think about it that [I realise] how remarkable they are. Mum went back to college and re-educated herself, which was the best thing ever \u2013 she found this whole new lease of life.\u201d</p> <p>Her parents had moved to Britain from Punjab; her father as a child, her mother when she was 19 (their marriage was arranged and they met at Heathrow airport). In 2014, Rani took part in the BBC family history show <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007t575\" title=\"\">Who Do You Think You Are?</a>, which proved to be one of the series\u2019 most moving episodes. She discovered it was very likely that her grandfather\u2019s first wife and daughter were killed during the partition in 1947 \u2013 either by suicide, or by members of their own family, to prevent them being raped and bringing \u201cdishonour\u201d on the family.</p> <p>As borders between the newly created Pakistan and India were formed, women were targeted in the resulting. They were raped, tortured and murdered (the Indian government estimates 83,000 women were brutalised and abducted, although the actual figure is probably far higher). The women in her family\u2019s village \u201cof my grandmother\u2019s generation had three choices at the point of partition \u2013 either they kill you, we kill you or you kill yourselves\u201d, says Rani. \u201cThat period of history is such a stain, on everyone \u2013 on India, Pakistan, Britain. Nobody talks about it, and yet it was a huge atrocity. So many British Asian kids got in touch with me after that and said: \u2018We never knew.\u2019\u201d The generation who lived through partition are now dying, \u201cand those stories have to be told\u201d.</p> <p>How did learning about her family\u2019s history change how she felt about her place in the world? \u201cI am a feminist. It\u2019s a no-brainer. It\u2019s a weird word even to say, because aren\u2019t all women feminists? It made me more determined to tell the stories of these women. It has dawned on me that I am the first in a long line of women to have choice about my life. No other woman in my history has been able to choose \u2013 to choose who she married, where she lived.\u201d She smiles, sounding upbeat as ever, but her eyes suddenly look watery. \u201cThere are a lot of Asian girls who still don\u2019t have that choice, and that drives me mad. I want all the women in the world to have a choice.\u201d</p> <p><em>Anita Rani presents This Morning, Fridays across summer, 10.30am on ITV, and New York: America\u2019s Busiest City on BBC2 later this month. </em></p>",
  "<p>Along Coney Island\u2019s boardwalk, in between hotdog and nacho stands and White Castle burger restaurants, stands <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/coneys-cones-brooklyn\">Coney\u2019s Cones</a>, a colorful gelato shop where for the last two seasons, under the supervision of a young Italian gelato master, hundreds of secret recipes are used to produce fresh, old-fashioned handcrafted iced delicacies for thousands of passersby. </p> <p>Daniele Dal Sasso, a chef and former<strong> </strong>co-owner of two family gelato stores in the small northern Italian town of Vicenza, helped open the shop in 2015 after CAI, a large Italian conglomerate which owns much of Coney Island\u2019s amusement park, flew the young chef to Brooklyn and asked whether he might consider opening a version of his Vicenza shops on the boardwalk. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/north-east-heatwave-ice-cream-theft\">Heatwave leads to ice-cream theft, flying cockroaches and exploding manure</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He remembers arriving at Coney\u2019s Cones, which was an American ice-cream shop at the time, and finding<strong> </strong>(much to his horror) bottles of corn syrup, artificial taste and coloring products, including a bottle containing orange liquid that read \u201cmango base\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cFor me there is only one kind of mango,\u201d Dal Sasso says. \u201cIt is the mango that comes from the tree, that I can touch, taste. It is the same with egg yolks. If I am going to use egg yolks, I want to separate them by hand. You can taste the difference.\u201d</p> <p>After some consideration, the then 28-year-old chef agreed he would sell part of his businesses in Italy and give the Coney Island project a chance, providing he was able to make gelato the same way he did at his stores in Italy: where lemons are squeezed by hand, and the frozen delicacy is consumed on the same day it was made. For Dal Sasso, making gelato is a careful art.</p> <p>\u201cIn a kitchen if the main ingredients are good, you can taste along the way, and the final product will be good. With gelato, it\u2019s more scientific. If you make one mistake the whole thing is over.\u201d</p> <p>Dal Sasso appears to be on trend. Over the last few years, Americans have been flocking to buy gelato in unprecedented numbers. According to market research firm Mintel, gelato consumption in the United States has exploded in recent years. Gelato sales went from just $9m in 2010 to $131m in 2015. </p> <p>Despite being the exact translation of \u201cice-cream\u201d in Italian, gelato has three main differences to its American counterpart: far less fat, less air, and a warmer serving temperature, helping it attain its signature silky texture. But those aren\u2019t the only rules Dal Sasso follows in making his gelato. </p> <p>\u201cThere are so many things to consider. Ingredients behave in different ways. If you put a banana in a freezer, it doesn\u2019t harden much, if you put a strawberry or yoghurt in, they become like stone. Rum won\u2019t freeze,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like playing music. Like a guitar. You touch a string and it will do one thing. Another will do another.\u201d</p> <p>Dal Sasso, now nearly 31, says that at the end of the day, what matters is loving what he creates \u2013 something he sees as a very Italian mentality. </p> <p>\u201cIn Italy, what arrives on the plate is the passion of the chef. In Italy, the person who makes your daily coffee is passionate about the coffee, the beans, taking care and cleaning the machines. For me, with gelato, it is the same. Recipes were born when I sat down, in love with the ingredients in front of me, and wanting them to taste the best.\u201d</p> <p>Once you do that, Dal Sasso says \u2013 with ice-cream or gelato \u2013 there is no longer a wrong way of doing it.</p>",

In a 2006 cable to the state department in Washington, US diplomats reported that the Party of Regions had undergone a mysterious transformation. \u201cLong a haven for Donetsk-based mobsters and oligarchs it is in the midst of an \u2018extreme makeover\u2019,\u201d they observed.</p> <p>The party had enlisted \u201chelp and advice from veteran K street political tacticians\u201d, the diplomats said, referring to Washington DC\u2019s lobbying district. Manafort\u2019s firm \u2013 Davis, Manafort &amp; Freedman \u2013 was busy \u201cnipping and tucking\u201d. Its goal was to rid the party of its gangster image and to change it into a \u201clegitimate political force\u201d.</p> <p>I met Manafort in September 2007, on the eve of the Ostroh rally. This was just before the parliamentary elections, and Yanukovych was frantically touring the regions on a campaign helicopter. </p> <p>Close up, Manafort looked every inch the classic Washington lobbyist. He wore an expensive suit and tie and exuded seriousness. He also bore a faint physical resemblance to his client \u2013 even their hairstyles were similar. (Manafort, I was told later, had instructed Yanukovych to blow-dry his hair. Manafort\u2019s camp denies this.)</p> <p>The American had an interesting story to tell \u2013 one which may sound familiar to observers of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign \u2013 of how his candidate had been almost wilfully misunderstood by the west, especially by its media.<br></p> <p>The new Yanukovych was nothing like the old one, Manafort suggested. He had absorbed the lessons of his previous defeats, was studying English \u2013 and was even playing tennis with the US ambassador.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are still looking at the political system in this country through the prism of 2004,\u201d Manafort told me. \u201cThat\u2019s not at all the situation here.\u201d <br></p> <p>Yanukovych was no puppet of Putin, Manafort said; he wanted a pragmatic foreign policy \u2013 good relations with Russia and the EU. </p> <p>\u201cAs a person, he [Yanukovych] is growing,\u201d Manafort assured me. \u201cI think the time out of power helped him.\u201d</p> <p>Manafort introduced professional techniques. He gathered polling data, worked on messaging and distributed talking points. His efforts were at least partially successful: Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions won the 2007 parliamentary elections, and in 2010 Yanukovych beat his rival Yulia Tymoshenko in a presidential runoff. Within a few months, it had become clear that he was hellbent on reversing the modest democratic gains of the Orange Revolution. </p> <p>Yanukovych moved quickly to consolidate all instruments of power: the courts, parliament, the prosecutor\u2019s office, <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/sergii-leshchenko/two-worlds-of-viktor-yanukovych%E2%80%99s-ukraine\">the media and TV</a>. Tymoshenko was charged with corruption and jailed; Yankovych repeatedly shrugged off western calls for her release. </p> <p>In late 2013, Yanukovych was due to sign an association agreement with the European Union, but at the last minute he dumped the plan and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/17/ukraine-russia-leaders-talks-kremlin-loan-deal\">instead accepted a $15bn Kremlin bailout</a>. </p> <p>Pro-EU demonstrators flooded the Maidan, Kiev\u2019s main square, and protests turned violent after a brutal crackdown by security forces.</p> <p>In February 2014, riot police shot dead 100 people in downtown Kiev.

Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/russia-accuses-ukraine-of-armed-crimea-incursion\">Russia claimed Ukrainian agents had attacked Crimea</a>, further fueling tensions in the region.<br></p> <p>Those who worked with Manafort say that he cannot be blamed for the Ukrainian disaster. Oleg Voloshin, a former aide to Kostyantyn Gryshchenko, Yanukovych\u2019s 2010-12 foreign minister who now works as a political consultant, says Manafort urged Yanukovych to press ahead with the EU integration agenda.</p> <p>Voloshin still has ties with the ex-Party of Regions, which Manafort rebranded in 2014 as the Opposition Bloc. (Manafort\u2019s consultancy in Ukraine continued until at least parliamentary elections in 2014.)</p> <p>He suggests that Yanukovych \u201clistened to what Paul said\u201d between 2007-2010, but then, once he became president, stopped listening \u2013 with catastrophic results.</p> <p>Manafort\u2019s advice was always non-ideological, Voloshin recalls. He would calmly explain: \u201cThese people won\u2019t vote for you, don\u2019t bother with them,\u201d and then suggest he \u201cpromote this message, promote that message\u201d. \u201cIt was a very American approach. Do this, do that.\u201d And, crucially: \u201cHe was the person dragging Yanukovych to the west.\u201d<br></p> <p>According to Voloshin, Manafort was an advocate of US interests and promoted American oil companies such as Chevron \u2013 so much so that the joke inside the Party of Regions was that Manafort was actually from the CIA. \u201cYou can blame him for whatever. The only thing you can\u2019t blame him for is lack of will in lobbying for American interests in Ukraine in the commercial sphere.\u201d</p> <p>Voloshin insists that it was Manafort who persuaded Yanukovych to press ahead with the EU integration agenda, arguing that it would counter Yanukovych\u2019s sagging ratings. Manafort also strongly objected to Tymoshenko\u2019s imprisonment, telling Yanukovych bluntly: \u201cYou are going to have very bad times with the west.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Paul\u2019s fault that Yanukovych didn\u2019t listen to him. If it weren\u2019t for Paul, Ukraine would have gone under Russia much earlier,\u201d Voloshin claims. </p> <p>During the period that he was advising Yanukovych, Manafort\u2019s interests in the post-Soviet world were not restricted to politics.<br></p> <p>In 2007, he set up a private equity firm called Pericles Emerging Partners LP.<br></p> <p>Based offshore in the Caymans, the firm had three American partners \u2013 Manafort, Rick Gates and Rick Davis. Davis had cofounded Davis Manafort, Manfort\u2019s lobbying company in Delaware. The new firm\u2019s aim was to make investments in the Ukrainian cities of Kiev, Odessa and Mariupol. It would acquire small companies, consolidate them into larger national enterprises, then sell them on.</p> <p>One of those tempted by this prospectus was the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum baron and close friend of Putin, who stumped up almost $19m. Gates, Manafort\u2019s right-hand man, sealed the agreement in trips to Moscow.</p> <p>What happened next was strange indeed. Only one investment by Pericles was ever made, in a Ukrainian telecoms company called Black Sea Cable. According to court documents, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-07-20/trump-s-manager-is-a-master-of-post-soviet-business\">the cash was funnelled into various offshore companies</a>, including one called CardMan ImpEx Corp, registered in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands. The trail wound through other opaque shell firms, including Cascado AG, set up by the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.</p> <p>A search of the Panama Papers leak gives a few details. Cascado has two Latvian directors, <a href=\"https://www.icij.org/offshore/faux-corporate-directors-stand-fraudsters-despots-and-spies\">Erik Vanagels and Stan Gorin</a>. In reality, they are mere nominees. The pair have been <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-07-20/trump-s-manager-is-a-master-of-post-soviet-business\">linked on paper to a network of offshore companies and multimillion-dollar scams involving Ukrainian state assets</a>.<br></p> <p>When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, Deripaska wanted out \u2013 and his cash back. In 2011, the Americans emailed to say that it was proving tricky to sell Deripaska\u2019s stake because of \u201cmarket conditions\u201d. Further emails went unanswered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6888bef114164dde81ae3754fac68b6d909db459\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6888bef114164dde81ae3754fac68b6d909db459/0_98_3469_2082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yulia Tymoshenko\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko alleged that Manafort \u2018played a key role in [a] conspiracy and racketeering enterprise\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt appears that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-business-as-in-politics-trump-adviser-no-stranger-to-controversial-figures/2016/04/26/970db232-08c7-11e6-b283-e79d81c63c1b_story.html\">simply disappeared</a>,\u201d <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2814130/Pericles-Winding-Up-Petition.pdf\">Deripaska\u2019s frustrated lawyers wrote</a>, in a 2014 petition to have Manafort\u2019s firm wound up.</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear if Deripaska ever got his money. Either way, the episode illustrates Manafort\u2019s personal links to figures close to Putin. </p> <p>Later, Manafort introduced Deripaska to Senator John McCain, when the oligarch was having problems travelling to the US. (In 2006, the US had revoked Deripaska\u2019s visa, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/31/oleg-deripaska-us-visa-rusal\">citing alleged \u201ccriminal associations\u201d</a>. Deripaska denies the allegation, and his visa was subsequently reinstated.)</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t the only embarrassing legal scrape arising from Manafort\u2019s capitalist adventures. In November 2011, Tymoshenko unsuccessfully sued him and several of her political opponents in the district court in New York. <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/manafort-complaint-2.pdf\">Her lengthy writ</a> alleged that Manafort \u201cplayed a key role in [a] conspiracy and racketeering enterprise\u201d to launder cash for Yanukovych\u2019s oligarch friends and invest it in New York real estate.</p> <p>In particular, she pointed the finger at Dmitry Firtash, a Ukrainian businessman whose generous contributions helped Yanukovych. Firtash is a shareholder and public face for RosUkrEnergo, an intermediary company co-owned by Gazprom, which imports gas from Russia and resells it to Ukraine. Tymoshenko tried unsuccessfully to get rid of it. </p> <p>The RusUkrEnergo scheme was a mechanism for corruption, she alleged in legal filings. Its real owner, she claimed, was Semyon Mogilevich, a Ukrainian-Russian mobster, and one of the FBI\u2019s top fugitives. Firtash denies this.</p> <p>According to her writ, Firtash and his companies and associates were able to skim billions of dollars from gas transactions. The cash was laundered \u201cthrough a labyrinth of shell companies\u201d. It was then returned to Ukraine, with the money used to bribe Ukrainian officials. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Manafort sells the unsellable product.

Manafort\u2019s plan was to buy the site of the demolished Drake Hotel in Manhattan and to redevelop it at a cost of almost $900m. <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/manafort-complaint-2.pdf\">Firtash transferred at least $25m to the project</a>.

He expanded the World Cup finals from a 16-nation to 24-nation and then 32-nation competition, invited almost all the countries in the world to join Fifa, and offered them increased involvement in it. By the time he left office in 1998, the organisation had more members than the UN.</p> <p>He was the first sports administrator to pursue global sponsors, such as Adidas and Coca-Cola, and gain total control of television rights and advertising, through his links with the now discredited and defunct sports marketing company ISL. The revolutionary lobbying and business techniques he used to win votes and contracts are now employed routinely.</p> <p>And yet, to his many critics, Havelange\u2019s zeal for commercialising football resulted in it losing its soul. There was rarely any evidence of his love for the game \u2013 the players, countries and hundreds of millions of fans to whom the game brings such joy seemed but parts of his money-spinning masterplan. Worse still, his administrative era was severely tainted by allegations of bribery and corruption, which intensified under the man he pushed forward to be his anointed successor, Sepp Blatter.</p> <p>Havelange was born in Rio de Janeiro to Belgian parents. His father was an arms trader who sent his son to school in France, and the family spoke French at home. Havelange played football as a youth but it was swimming at which he excelled, and he represented Brazil at the Berlin Olympics in 1936 (the year in which he also earned a law degree). He won a bronze medal for water polo at the Pan American Games in 1951, and represented Brazil in the sport at the Helsinki Olympics in 1952.</p> <p>He made his fortune building up Cometa, a transport businesses, but it was as a sports administrator that Havelange made his name. He led the Brazilian delegation to the Melbourne Olympics in 1956 and became a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1963. In 1958 he was appointed head of the CBD, the Brazilian Sports Confederation, which oversaw all the nation\u2019s sports.</p> <p>The appointment was made six months before Brazil won their first World Cup, in Sweden, and coincided with a golden era of Brazilian football as they went on to win the tournament again in Chile in 1962 and Mexico in 1970. The 1958 and 1970 teams included a galaxy of stars, among them Pel\u00e9, who would become an important figure in Havelange\u2019s quest for power.</p> <p>His role in funding and organising Brazil\u2019s World Cup victories was important, if typically autocratic. In 1958 he included a psychologist in the party (fearing some players were still affected by the trauma of 1950, when Brazil lost in the final at home in Rio, in front of 200,000 people), and wanted to impose <em>concentra\u00e7\u00e3o total </em>on the squad, effectively round-the-clock supervision, believing that football was too important to be left to the footballers.</p> <p>By the late 1960s Brazil was entering the most brutal phase of a 20-year military dictatorship and Havelange appeased the generals by sacking the coach, Jo\u00e3o Saldanha, a member of the Brazilian Communist party, in 1969. He also instigated a three-month pre-tournament training camp for the squad. They won the 1970 World Cup playing some of the best football ever seen, but they arrived in Mexico wearing dark green, military-style suits.</p> <p>In 1969, with an eye on the Fifa votes of African football federations, he organised a tour of the continent for Pel\u00e9\u2019s club, Santos. It was Havelange who circulated the story that the opposing sides in the Biafran civil war in Nigeria declared a two-day truce so they could watch Pel\u00e9 play. Years later, Pel\u00e9 claimed the story was exaggerated. There was the chance for more lobbying in 1972 when Havelange invited 20 countries to Brazil, all expenses paid, to play in an unrecognised football tournament, the Brazil Independence Cup.</p> <p>By the time of the 1974 election for Fifa president, Havelange had spent millions touring the world lobbying for votes, often accompanied by Pel\u00e9. He reckoned he had visited 86 countries in 10 weeks in the runup to the election.</p> <p>His strategy was to attack the European dominance of Fifa while promising developing countries a greater role, money for their football infrastructure and an expanded World Cup. He paid for many poorer African delegates, who otherwise rarely bothered to turn up at such meetings, to attend for the vote. Despite the enormous global success of the 1970 World Cup, broadcast for the first time in colour, the incumbent Fifa president, Sir Stanley Rous, was hanging on to amateur traditions and supported apartheid in South African sport. He was an easy opponent for Havelange to outmanoeuvre.</p> <p>According to Patrick Nally, a pioneer of modern sports marketing who played a key role in the victory, interviewed by the journalist Andrew Jennings for Dishonored Games (1992): \u201cHavelange had seen the future \u2026 He knew that if he became the president of the only federation already running its own high-profile world championship, then he would enjoy huge economic power.\u201d</p> <p>Havelange had relatively little influence on his first World Cup as Fifa president, held in Argentina, then ruled by a military junta. He let the generals and the head of the Argentinian organising committee, Vice-Admiral Carlos Lacoste, run it their way. In the semi-final stage, Argentina beat Peru 6-0, one of the most controversial results in the history of the tournament.</p> <p>While that match was in progress, a bomb exploded at the home of the Argentinian finance secretary, Juan Alemann, who had criticised the organising committee for wasting millions of dollars on the World Cup. Alemann believed Lacoste had masterminded the operation. Two years later, Havelange appointed Lacoste a Fifa vice-president. When democratic rule was restored to Argentina in 1983, Lacoste was investigated for corruption.</p> <p>Havelange\u2019s expansion of the World Cup began at the 1982 tournament in Spain, when the number of teams increased from 16 to 24. The following World Cup was scheduled to be held in Colombia, but when the country pulled out in financial difficulties, the US, Canada and Mexico put themselves forward to host it. In a show of strength that typified Havelange\u2019s rule, every member of the Fifa executive committee voted with him in support of Mexico.</p> <p>Mexico 1986 set a template for future World Cups \u2013 and was soon copied by other global sports federations. Havelange backed Mexico\u2019s bid because of his close relationship with <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/news/y=1997/m=1/news=fifa-senior-vice-president-guillermo-canedo-has-died-70175.html\">Guillermo Ca\u00f1edo</a>, a Fifa vice-president and Mexican media baron who brokered a lucrative global TV deal with ISL.</p> <p>The founder of ISL was the German businessman Horst Dassler, former boss of Adidas, who, together with Havelange and the IOC chairman <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/apr/21/juan-antonio-samaranch-obituary\">Juan Antonio Samaranch</a>, were the most senior members of \u201cthe club\u201d, an exclusive group of sports administrators and marketing men who controlled a large proportion of international sport. It was a cosy relationship, with the world\u2019s two most powerful sporting bodies and the company that provided the lion\u2019s share of their income all based in Switzerland.</p> <p>ISL bought the rights to the World Cup for enormous sums, peaking in 1996 at the \u00a31.45bn combined bid for rights to the 2002 and 2006 finals. The company folded in 2001, leaving debts of \u00a3153m and a trail of corruption that led to Fifa\u2019s door. A Swiss court investigating the collapse, and the whereabouts of millions of missing dollars, heard evidence from a legal representative of Christoph Malms, a former ISL chief executive, that \u201cthe company became a private source of money for Fifa, virtually their private bank\u201d.</p> <p>After two decades, Havelange\u2019s Napoleonic rule began to stretch the patience of even loyal Fifa executives. He developed the habit of closing executive meetings by simply leaving the room and, in one famous case, postponing a discussion on Fifa appointments by handing out his own list of new committee members, then declaring the list passed without a vote.</p> <p>He banned Pel\u00e9 from attending the draw for the 1994 World Cup in Las Vegas after a feud involving Ricardo Teixeira, Havelange\u2019s then son-in-law and president of the Brazilian Football Confederation. This behaviour towards Pel\u00e9 would have raised eyebrows anywhere in the world. In the US, where he was the only soccer player known to many Americans, it was reckless.</p> <p>Havelange survived one more term as president, secured after further intensive lobbying and a promise to expand the World Cup from 24 to 32 teams for the 1998 tournament. Before resigning in 1998, he helped his righthand man, Blatter, to win the vote to succeed him, over the Uefa president, Lennart Johansson.</p> <p>In 2011, Jennings told a Brazilian senate investigation that Havelange had received bribes totalling around $50m from ISL. Later that year the IOC ethics committee announced that it would investigate claims that he had received bribes of $1m. Soon afterwards, he resigned from the IOC for health reasons.</p> <p>In April 2013 he resigned as honorary president of Fifa, again citing health reasons. Jennings led a BBC team for a Panorama programme in December 2015 that revealed the existence of a letter written by Havelange in 2010 claiming that disputed payments to him were above board and known to Blatter. An investigation by the FBI led to Blatter\u2019s ejection from Fifa later that month.</p> <p>Havelange and his wife, Anna Maria (nee Hermanny), had a daughter, L\u00facia, who was divorced from Teixeira in 1997, a granddaughter, Joana, director of the organising committee of the Brazil 2014 World Cup, and two grandsons, Ricardo and Roberto.</p> <p>\u2022 Jean-Marie Faustin Godefroid de Havelange, lawyer, sports administrator and businessman, born 8 May 1916; died 16 August 2016</p>",
  "<p>This week the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/weekly\" title=\"\">Guardian Weekly</a> shines a light on the scandalous conditions suffered by Australian asylum seekers in the country\u2019s offshore detention centre on the Micronesian island of Nauru.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/nauru-files/all\" title=\"\">The Nauru files</a> \u2013 first published on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/au\" title=\"\">Guardian Australia</a> website last week \u2013 are the largest set of leaked documents published from inside Australia\u2019s immigration detention system. They are a set of more than 2,000 incident reports from the Nauru detention centre, written by guards, caseworkers and teachers on the remote Pacific island. They set out every reportable \u201cincident\u201d on the island. Such events include attempts at self-harm, sexual assaults, child abuse, hunger strikes, assaults and injuries.</p> <p>While some of these cases have been reported by the Guardian and other news organisations, the logs set out in detail the totality of harm caused by prolonged detention in Australia\u2019s notorious offshore camps. The Weekly brings you extensive coverage and comment on this shameful state of affairs, and you can find full details and analysis of the Nauru files on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/nauru-files/all\" title=\"\">Guardian Australia website</a>.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the paper we hear from Germany about tough new anti-terror screening proposals targeted at refugees entering the country. In France, a backlash is gathering steam against Muslim-friendly swimwear on the nation\u2019s beaches. There is news of a foiled terror attack in Canada, and the death in Syria of a UK schoolgirl who converted to Islamic State has prompted questions about a British youth anti-extremism programme. The new normal is well and truly with us, it seems.</p> <p>From Ireland, we find out why communities in the north and south who have become accustomed to living in peace are concerned about potential renewed border controls arising from the UK\u2019s Brexit vote. And in the US, after another week of rally performances alternating between shocking and baffling, we ask whether the wheels are finally coming off Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.</p> <p>From India we bring you the incredible tale of the activist who ended a 16-year hunger strike and is now planning a new life in politics. In Afghanistan, a brain drain of young people is hindering plans to rebuild the war-ravaged country.</p> <p>Our Weekly review lead chronicles an inspiring Australian doctor who exposed the widespread practice of corporate investment in big tobacco. We also hear from Lagos in Nigeria, where a new law prohibiting street hawking is set to shake up the city\u2019s economy.</p> <p>There\u2019s a definite mind and body feel to the back of this week\u2019s paper. Discovery examines the beneficial effects of multilingualism on the mind, while Books charts the history of exercise culture and the enduring quest for the body beautiful.

  "<p>Friends who have devoted selfless hours to helping asylum seekers for decades get upset when someone suggests that many such people game the system, knowing that they will be rejected as the economic migrants they really are. But a veteran civil liberties lawyer I also know quickly changed her tune when she started examining appeals in detail. There is a lot of abuse, she concluded.</p> <p>Tricky, isn\u2019t it? People fight for all sorts of rights and humane procedures, only to see them cynically abused by false claimants, wicked people smugglers and nimble-footed solicitors.</p> <p>We admire lawyers who fight the police or NHS on behalf of mistreated clients, many of them poor people with no hope of redress without legal aid or the US-style \u201cno win, no fee\u201d provision introduced by Tony Blair\u2019s government. Films are made about their successes, in which even journalists, such as Chris Mullin in the Birmingham Six case, occasionally come out well.</p> <p>We also recoil, however, from adverts on low-grade TV channels offering all sorts of legal services to help people fight claims that, if successful, will probably help the law firm more than the client. Whiplash injuries in car crashes, sustained in suspiciously high numbers in Britain, are a notorious example. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/oct/03/whiplash-epidemic-pain-insurers-necks-motoring\">insurance industry struggles</a> to deal with the \u201ccompensation culture\u201d.</p> <p>The phrase that captures conflicting impulses is \u201cambulance chasing\u201d. One man\u2019s shining knight can be another\u2019s ambulance chaser. Which takes us straight to this week\u2019s reported news that the Birmingham lawyer Phil Shiner\u2019s Public Interest Lawyers firm is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/15/public-interest-lawyers-iraq-war-al-sweady-theresa-may-uk-troops\">closing its doors</a> after the Legal Aid Agency ruled that it would no longer have access to legal aid funds. The move follows allegations, still being investigated, that PIL has committed assorted abuses in its pursuit of British military misconduct in southern Iraq. The firm has asked the high court to allow it to cease representing 187 Iraqi claims, with 1,000 more abandoned in the pipeline.</p> <p>A paragraph such as that may anger both sides in this kind of dispute. How dare a lawyer safe in London undermine the morale and cohesion of Britain\u2019s brave armed forces for doing their best in the near-impossible circumstances of a sectarian Iraqi civil war more horrible than the Troubles in Northern Ireland? To post-traumatic stress disorder is now added <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3383132/I-cleared-TWICE-lawyers-hounding-says-war-hero-Decorated-soldier-says-left-rot-death-Iraqi-civilian-armed-AK-47.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490\">prolonged legal persecution</a>.</p> <p>Alternatively, how typical of the British establishment to shut down an expos\u00e9 of how western invaders really behave in an illegal war. Soldiers in battle must be required to respect the human rights of those that they fight. They and their commanding officers must be held accountable when they fall short in Iraq, Afghanistan or elsewhere.</p> <p>It goes without saying that Theresa May is reportedly pleased that PIL is going out of business and the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, a shrill tubthumper in most circumstances, is delighted. So are the papers that always \u201cdefend our boys\u201d - the Telegraph, the Sun and, of course, the redoubtable Daily Mail.</p> <p>I yield to no one in my distaste for what much of the Mail does. Its behaviour in the Brexit debate, before and after the referendum, has been disgraceful. Reading a centenary account of the Somme the other day, I noted generals hesitating to do the right thing in that dreadful battle for fear of what the Mail might say in 1916. But as I never tire of telling students or Twitter trolls: \u201cThe Daily Mail is not always wrong.\u201d </p> <p>In fact, it\u2019s often right, as regular readers, me and most of Fleet Street, know. Read <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3726115/Child-killer-s-2m-legal-aid-taxpayers-funded-Ellie-Butler-s-warped-father-s-battle-custody-little-girl-went-murder.html\">this shocking example</a> of justice abused that the paper exposed 11 days ago. It whips up hysteria and anxiety, day in and day out. But there\u2019s good stuff in the mix too: attacks on fatcat bankers, police chiefs, and insurance and supermarket ripoffs.</p> <p>Here\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3740538/His-firm-s-shut-soldiers-planning-SUE-him.html\">the long read</a> on the PIL case, by the feature writer Robert Hardman, always more measured than some of Paul Dacre\u2019s talented band of 1,500-word assassins. It charts Shiner\u2019s successes, including the \u00a32m payout to the family of Baha Mousa, the Iraqi hotel receptionist who died in military custody in 2003, and his awards from what the Mail likes to call \u201cthe legal establishment\u201d.</p> <p>Hardman also sets out the accusations that have laid PIL low: having triggered the \u00a331m Al-Sweady inquiry into the conduct of British troops in a 2004 firefight with insurgents, the firm sat on conflicting evidence that undermined its clients\u2019 case for a year, before withdrawing their claim. There are separate allegations of the bribery of witnesses, all of them disputed amid claims of political persecution, I should stress.</p> <p>Some of the most serious claims brought by Iraqis were not exaggerated, but \u201cdeliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility\u201d lay behind them, Al-Sweady\u2019s investigating judge, Sir Thayne Forbes, concluded.</p> <p>Here\u2019s an <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/phil-shiner-interview-a-righter-of-wrongs-in-iraq-or-the-worst-kind-of-ambulance-chaser-10262065.html\">interview with Shiner</a> and here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/apr/07/public-interest-lawyers-iraq-death-case-misled-court-judge-rules\">report on how</a> one allegation came to grief.<br></p> <p>It is not that courts and inquiries have not found that overstretched British forces did bad things in Iraq and Afghanistan, let alone, as Chilcot\u2019s inquiry confirmed, made a pretty poor overall job of their tasks in both countries, to the dismay of the Americans. They did.</p> <p>But spurious ambulance chasing in the name of human rights seems grubby in a very different way. Shiner is now facing a solicitor\u2019s disciplinary inquiry that he hopes to have conducted behind closed doors, citing ill health. He\u2019s entitled to all the protection that the law can provide. There are painful layers of irony in this unhappy saga. </p>",

  "<p>The immediate reaction to the EU referendum result in three British national newspapers was negative towards Brexit, according to a study of their content.</p> <p>It found that despite their differing stances prior to the vote, the pro-Brexit Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail, were - at least in some measure - in agreement with the pro-remain Guardian.</p> <p>Of the 489 articles about Brexit published in the three titles (and their Sunday equivalents) between 25 June and 1 July, 39% were negative towards the vote to leave the European Union while 27% were positive (and 34% were deemed neutral).</p> <p>The study\u2019s author, Caroline Lees, remarked: \u201cEven the Daily Mail and The Telegraph, which had enthusiastically <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/heres-where-britains-newspapers-stand-on-the-eu-referendum/\">backed the leave campaign</a> before the vote, had a neutral, \u2018pragmatic\u2019 response.\u201d</p> <p>She believed \u201cthe cautious coverage reflected that the vote to leave the UK was unexpected, even among pro-Brexit newspapers. It was not a time to \u2018gloat\u2019, according to one pro-Brexit newspaper, but a time for \u2018sober, responsible\u2019 reporting.\u201d </p> <p>She thought \u201ccommercial priorities also influenced editorial decisions. Newspapers were reluctant to alienate readers who voted to remain at a time when the UK was deeply divided over the result.\u201d<br></p> <p>Her review of the output of the three papers is part of a wider study conducted by the European Journalism Observatory (EJO).*</p> <p>Three issues were considered: Brexit\u2019s British impact; its impact on the EU; and whether the EU was better off with, or without, Britain as a member. I am dealing here only with the first of those.</p> <p>Most of the Brexit-related articles published in the three papers over the course of the seven days after the referendum concerned the impact of the leave vote on Britain. The Mail published 50 (30%) articles arguing Brexit would be \u201cgood for Britain\u201d; the Telegraph published 52 (38%); and the Guardian published six (3%). </p> <p>The Guardian published 113 articles (56%) arguing that Brexit would be bad for Britain. They contained headlines or phrases such as \u201cthe pound will weaken\u201d, \u201cinvestors will pull out\u201d, \u201cbusinesses will leave the UK\u201d, \u201cunemployment will rise\u201d, \u201cracism will increase\u201d, \u201cdivisions in society will widen\u201d.\u2019 </p> <p>Many articles in the Mail took a similar line, with 25 (19%) indicating that Brexit would be bad for Britain. And 18 articles (10%) in the Telegraph reflected that too.<br></p> <p>Noting the Telegraph\u2019s somewhat neutral coverage, Lees cited a source at the paper as saying it reflected an editorial decision to \u201cproceed with caution... It would have been wrong to start gloating and saying \u2018we told you so\u2019. It was a momentous event and we had to treat it seriously.\u201d The source continued\u201d</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cWe were pro-Brexit before the referendum but we were also pragmatic, we wanted to put both sides of the argument to our readers. The pragmatic attitude continued after the vote. </p> <p>While the newspaper believed leaving the EU was best for Britain, the result had divided the nation and we felt strongly it had to come back together. The decision had been taken and we needed to make sure the next step was right.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>According to her Telegraph source, the paper felt it necessary \u201cto carry [with us] the 48% of the population and the 30% of our subscribers, who were anti-Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>The study touches on the fact that anti-Brexit articles published after the referendum focused on the rise of racist attacks and abuse.

  "<p>This week sees the nationwide launch of <a href=\"https://www.bk.com/menu-item/whopperrito\">Burger King\u2019s Whopperrito</a>. No, you didn\u2019t read that wrong \u2013 the fast-food king has really put a Whopper in a burrito.</p> <p>Like <a href=\"https://www.kfc.co.uk/our-food/for-one/wraps/zinger-burrito\">KFC\u2019s burrito project</a> before it, the Whopperrito is a bland reminder that mediocre meals remain mediocre even when they put on new party clothes.</p> <p>But it points to a new trend in hipster food: the burritofication of all food types. Jeffrey Pilcher, a food historian and author of Planet Taco: A Global History of Mexican Food, says the burrito and the taco have become a new kind of shorthand for chefs. \u201cPut something in a burrito and it acquires this cool edge,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of Americanizing foreign food, but without that McDonald\u2019s feel.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5250c3e14be4614743ec8005a148cc962a56aa0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5250c3e14be4614743ec8005a148cc962a56aa0f/0_138_3872_2325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"If you can\u2019t stand chicken fries then try Burger King\u2019s new offering, the Whopperrito.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you can\u2019t stand chicken fries then try Burger King\u2019s new offering, the Whopperrito.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Simmonds/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In San Francisco, the birthplace of the \u201cMission-style\u201d burrito \u2013 the meaty, rice-filled, bean-and-cheese experience that most will recognize \u2013 a growing number of cooks are experimenting with the burrito blueprint. The basics remain the same: a carpeting of carbs (usually rice), meat or fish, and something fresh (avocado, salads or vegetables) twisted up in a tortilla, bread or other wrap. But the results vary wildly.</p> <p>So if the burrito \u2013 not the burger \u2013 is now America\u2019s favorite food playground, who\u2019s getting it right and who\u2019s getting it wrong? I ate my way through nine burritos in four days to bring you the answer.</p> <h2><strong>What doesn\u2019t work</strong></h2> <p><strong>The Whopper-rrito</strong></p> <p>Burger King\u2019s burger in a burrito launched nationwide on Monday. Yes, we tried it. And yes, it\u2019s pretty lame. It lacks inspiration, texture and bite. It\u2019s a taco-flavored burger in a tortilla and none the better for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3685f18c8706c1d6f65d7ae8f74d138b10252ceb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3685f18c8706c1d6f65d7ae8f74d138b10252ceb/0_151_3872_2325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Whopperrito, best left unwrapped.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Whopperrito, best left unopened.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Simmonds/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>KFC tried a similar stunt last year by releasing a fried chicken and a pulled chicken burrito in the UK. I tried it on a rainy day in London and it was miserable, tasting simultaneously of nothing at all and overwhelmingly of artificial cheese.</p> <p>Conclusion: good burritos can be made in the same amount of time it takes to get a fast-food burrito and they aren\u2019t much more expensive (my Whopperrito meal cost nearly $7). Treat yourself to the real deal.</p> <p><strong>The ramen-rrito</strong></p> <p>Some restaurants in California have been putting <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-indomie-burrito-komodo-20151030-story.html\">ramen noodles</a> inside <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/-zuzEoI2Oe/\">burritos</a> and, while I have not actually tried it (nearby restaurants no longer serve them. You work out why), the premise is terrifying.

  "<p>I spent my childhood in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It\u2019s as hot and humid as where I live now \u2013 southern Florida \u2013 but without the guns and alligators. My hometown was a sleepy, multi-ethnic city of two million people. Still, there was an underlying tension in society. I did not know then that being of the wrong ethnic minority group (Chinese) and the wrong religion (Catholic) I would not be able to easily attend college because of the ethnic quota system that favors ethnic Malays. The fact that I was not a Muslim also meant I faced state-sanctioned discrimination.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/22/tell-us-how-you-got-here\">Tell us how you got here: share your stories of immigration</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I did not know then that there was institutional racism <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4795808.stm\">in Malaysia, though as I grew up the more I learned that it existed. </a>Perhaps feeling that there wasn\u2019t a future for me in Malaysia, I moved to Singapore at 16 to attend high school. From there on out, I didn\u2019t look back and kept moving. I went to college and met my first love, a US military officer who had started his first foreign assignment. He was all baseball cap, burgers and baseball. But we were so young and I knew better than to fall for the movie clich\u00e9 of \u201can officer and a gentleman\u201d. We parted ways.</p> <p>I ended up building a career in the United Nations and non-profits in Asia and Europe. I was assigned to the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan before 9/11. I worked in remote villages and wore a salwar kameez and headscarf. I drank whiskey in hiding and stopped craving roast pork. Coincidentally prior to 9/11, I had decided to come to graduate school in New York City.</p> <p>Several days after the attacks, my student visa was issued by the American embassy in Kuala Lumpur. The consular officer explained to me that my visa would be valid for seven years, longer than the duration of the grad school program. She continued to explain that right after the World Trade Center had been hit, the world had changed forever and she did not know if citizens of Muslim countries would be able to easily enter America. She wanted me to come here, succeed and thrive. </p> <p>I spent my initial years in NYC and Berkeley and had come to admire what America stands for. Then I left the United States and resumed my work in humanitarian aid. The years passed and I had lived and worked in 12 countries. I was exposed to different countries with civil wars, human rights abuses and the systemic failings of governments. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/19/immigrant-who-chose-be-wrong-kind-doctor-academic\">I was an immigrant who chose to be the wrong kind of doctor: an academic | Mita Choudhury</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On January 9, 2009, my Zimbabwean friend and I watched the inauguration ceremonies of President Barack Obama.

Only in America can there be so many historical and political differences, yet an African American is the US president.</p> <p>Two decades after my first love and I parted ways, my now husband found me. He was assigned to South Korea and I had returned to work in Singapore. He is a high ranking officer and a patriot who truly loves his country. He is also very much a boy from the Bronx who has to try hard not to break into his New York City accent. He is still all baseball cap, burgers and baseball (New York Yankees!). </p> <p>We got married and I migrated to America. We are currently assigned to south Florida. I guess moving to different parts of America adds more layers to my immigration story. Just like living in 12 countries and discovering different societies and cultures, I keep discovering that Americans are different. </p> <p>The 50 states have different perspectives, convictions and ways of life; some that I can get on board with and others that I will oppose. But compared to the failed countries that I have worked in, I continue to believe in and admire my country, that all our states are still strongly held together. There may be guns and alligators in South Florida, panic rooms in the hospital if there are active shootings (unheard of anywhere else in the world!) but I will continue to love this country. </p>",

  "<p>Gabon is 85% rainforest. Flying over the giant canopy, the miles pass without a glimpse of the forest floor.</p> <p>Then a bald patch emerges. In the clearing in Awala, which has become Africa\u2019s biggest industrial plantation, men in boots tend to thousands of small palm trees in long rows.</p> <p>They are setting the scene for palm oil production, which the government says is one of the best ways to tackle the country\u2019s terrible inequality. Gabon is one of Africa\u2019s richest countries, but many of its citizens are among the poorest \u2013 a malady common in countries rich with natural resources.</p> <p>Its tiny <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/gabon/overview\">population of 1.9 million</a><strong> </strong>and huge oil wealth mean in 2015 it had a GDP per capita of<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD\">about $8,300</a> (\u00a36,446), one of the highest in the continent. However, a third of its citizens live below the poverty line, and <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/03/31/gabons-unemployment-conundrum-why-economic-growth-is-not-leading-to-more-jobs\">unemployment stands at more than 20%</a> \u2013 35% among young people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2016/aug/08/unlocking-the-mystery-of-gabons-cuckoo-migration-in-pictures\">Unlocking the mystery of Gabon's cuckoo migration \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The plantations, the government hopes, will create jobs in rural areas and help the country diversify away from oil.</p> <p>\u201cInevitably, when you have a country which suddenly gets quite a considerable revenue, and you don\u2019t have production on the market level, the result is the atrophy of other sectors,\u201d says Gabon\u2019s economic minister, Regis Immongault. \u201cThe result is that costs go up, marginalising part of the population.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t try to hide the poverty. Although there is growth, it is not necessarily inclusive. There is still a level of precariousness that we should absolutely fight.\u201d</p> <p>The need to diversify industry has grown more urgent as falling oil prices have slashed the country\u2019s income, with a knock-on effect on the poorest citizens.</p> <p>With a still relatively unskilled workforce, attracting foreign investment is key, according to the country\u2019s president, Ali Bongo Ondimba. His bold ambition is to <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2013/car022813c.htm\">turn Gabon into an emerging economy</a> by 2025.</p> <p>\u201cAli Bongo is very sharp and he could see that the difficulty with producing raw materials was that it doesn\u2019t create many jobs,\u201d says Paul Melly, an associate fellow at Chatham House. \u201cHis goal has been to move Gabon to a higher-tech, skilled economy.\u201d</p> <p>Bongo has signed deals worth $4.5bn with three Asian companies. One is Singapore-based Olam, which is developing 100,000 hectares (247,105 acres) of oil palm trees in Gabon. The company has also collaborated with the government to set up a 1,000 hectare special economic zone, in a 40-60% public-private partnership. The government offers special terms to any foreign firm willing to build inside the zone.</p> <p>There are no taxes or customs duties for the first 10 years. The zone offers fast-tracked documentation \u2013 you can create a company in 48 hours, or get an investor\u2019s visa in three days.</p> <p>The walled-off zone is in Nkok, just outside the capital, Libreville, on a road that is being rebuilt. Just inside the gate, two concrete panthers gaze down from a large replica of the national coat of arms.</p> <p>Warehouses containing logs, scrap metal and workers are inside the walls. Most of the land is empty, although it is a constant race against the forest to keep it so. Here, abandoned cars don\u2019t just sit and rust, they are swallowed by the jungle.</p> <p>Most of the warehouses are used to process timber \u2013 one of the country\u2019s main exports. However, Gabon has banned the export of raw logs to ensure materials are transformed in-country, to create more jobs.</p> <p>Many of the skilled jobs \u2013 in Nkok and on the plantations \u2013 are done by foreign workers while Gabonese are trained.</p> <p></p> <p>Bongo, who became president in 2009, has sought to distance himself from the legacy of his late father, Omar, who was president for 42 years and was accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/05/1\">squandering Gabon\u2019s oil wealth</a>. To great fanfare \u2013 and widespread <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21661821-selfless-act-memory-fine-man-giving-back-gabon?fsrc=scn/tw/te/pe/ed/givingbackingabon\">cynicism</a> \u2013 Bongo <a href=\"http://mgafrica.com/article/2015-08-18-in-rare-move-for-an-african-leader-gabons-bongo-says-gives-away-family-property-to-nations-young-people\">announced last year that he would \u201cgive up\u201d his share of the inheritance</a> from his father. He has also implemented a successful <a href=\"http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/91/5/13-020513/en/\">health insurance system</a> for poor people funded by a 10% levy on the turnover of mobile phone companies.</p> <p>Gagan Gupta, the head of Olam in Gabon, believes that the strategy is working: the new factories and plantations are helping to reduce poverty. In Mouila, in Gabon\u2019s south-west, a plantation meant a $1.5m monthly salary injection into what was previously a subsistence economy, according to Gupta.</p> <p>\u201cPutting money in is very easy,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more difficult bit is how you make a public-private partnership work. The government brings the ability to give investors ease of doing business. We bring technical experience. We bring credibility. When we go to the banks and say we\u2019re executing it, the banks are much more comfortable that if Olam is doing it, it\u2019ll get done.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the government does not bring, which helps us, is interference. About 6,000 people work in the extractive industry. And with us, you have about 9,000 people working in a project that\u2019s six years old. Olam and the government of Gabon have brought relevant contributions to this partnership and actually made a success [of it].\u201d</p> <p>However, big plantations like Olam\u2019s are a serious threat to biodiversity and rural populations, <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif2tXN_bjOAhUqCsAKHbOAAtYQFggeMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fern.org%2Fsites%2Ffern.org%2Ffiles%2FFW%2520181%2520April%25202013_0.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6HILyFtY3cv4-0Cpf-HyLsQgflw&amp;sig2=XVbX4ynfdM49q79LZuXQ-A&amp;cad=rja\">according to a 2013 report by Brainforest</a>, an environmental NGO in Gabon.</p> <p>Building up other industries to lower oil dependency could have taken other, more sustainable routes, Brainforest said.</p> <p>\u201cGabon is very dependent on other countries for its food. So their efforts to diversify away from oil should have been focused on planting food crops, so as to move towards self-sufficiency,\u201d says Brainforest\u2019s Protet Essono-Ondo. \u201cBut since 2009, the government has been focused on agribusiness, specifically palm oil and rubber, even though various studies have shown that people\u2019s priority is food crops and vegetables.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the jobs created were \u201cprecarious seasonal jobs, without any security or sustainability,\u201d says Essono-Ondo.</p> <p>He added there is not enough consultation about government initiatives to attract business, and the awarding of contracts is murky.</p> <p>Ultimately, Melly says, delivering results for the poorest will depend on how strong the government\u2019s willpower is, or the leverage donors can still exercise. \u201cIn other countries they can still strike a bargain, and if you\u2019re in Mali or Benin, you\u2019re not in a position to argue. That\u2019s not the case in Gabon.\u201d</p> <p>The question is whether the hundreds of thousands Gabonese living below the poverty line will get a share in the success this time around.</p>",

  "<p>Damage to the economy caused by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit </a>will more than offset the modest wage gains for British-born workers in low-paid jobs caused by cutting net migration to the tens of thousands a year, a study has found.</p> <p>A report by the Resolution Foundation thinktank said there would be a small pay increase to native-born employees in sectors such as security and cleaning if there was a big cut in the number of workers arriving in Britain from overseas.</p> <p>But it estimated that these benefits would fail to compensate for the reduction in real incomes caused in the short term by the higher inflation triggered by a falling pound, and in the long term by a slowdown in the economy\u2019s growth rate.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation also warned that achieving the government\u2019s target of cutting annual net migration from more than 300,000 to the tens of thousands would present serious challenges for companies that rely on low-paid migrant workers \u2013 and could force some of them out of business.</p> <p>Immigration was a significant factor in the referendum campaign, with a sizeable number of those who voted to leave the EU citing it as reason for supporting Brexit. Early last month, Theresa May, then home secretary, said the government had received a clear message from the electorate and needed to control the numbers of people coming into the UK from the EU.</p> <p>But the Resolution Foundation study found that the wages of British workers in sectors most affected by migration would rise by just 0.2-0.6% by 2018, even if the government was able to hit its net migration target immediately. It noted that since the referendum the <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/inflationreport/2016/aug.pdf#page=37\">Bank of England</a> had cut its forecast for average earnings over the same period by two percentage points.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"caec2e2cfde45a65b9c276a4a427690a3f5349dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caec2e2cfde45a65b9c276a4a427690a3f5349dc/0_83_2616_1571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A vineyard in Sussex, one of many food and drink manufacturers that rely heavily on migrant workers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A vineyard in Sussex, one of many food and drink manufacturers that rely heavily on migrant workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Alden/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While concluding that reducing net migration would have little impact on the earnings and employment prospects of British workers overall, the thinktank said a dramatic reduction in the numbers coming to Britain to work could cause \u201csevere damage\u201d to industries such as food and clothing manufacturing and domestic personnel, where more than 30% of the workforce are migrants.<br></p> <p>\u201cGoing forward, recruitment is likely to be a challenge for these sectors. Given the fact that migrants in these sectors earn a lot less than average native wages, it is unlikely that these sectors will be able to substitute migrant for native labour without rethinking their business models,\u201d it added.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation called on the government to place these sectors at the heart of a new industrial strategy. In particular, the thinktank suggested a short-term guarantee for the right of migrant workers in these sectors to prevent a \u201cshort, sharp drop in the number of workers available for work, which could threaten the viability of some businesses\u201d.</p> <p>Beyond that it called for investment in skills and labour-saving technology to support more high-paid jobs or replace low-paid roles that could no longer be filled.</p> <p>And it suggested that a reformed migration system after Brexit was likely to be more dependent on temporary workers, which it said would require an overhaul of \u201cthe light-touch labour market enforcement regime\u201d in the UK.</p> <p>The study pointed out that there were just 350 frontline staff at three government agencies enforcing the minimum wage, employment standards and tackling gangmasters \u2013 equivalent to one officer for every 20,000 working-age migrants.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation called for a new single labour enforcement unit that would work to prevent new forms of illegal migration, including overstaying workers, and the undercutting of pay and conditions.<br></p> <p>The thinktank\u2019s director, Torsten Bell, said the study showed the impact of migration was complicated and needed to be responded to. But he pointed out that other factors as a result of Brexit, including the potential economic downturn, would have a much bigger impact on the wages of British people.<br></p> <p>\u201cTo reduce net migration to the tens of thousands would mean cutting the numbers coming from within the EU by much more than half while simultaneously significantly reducing migration from the rest of the world,\u201d said Bell.<br></p> <p>\u201cTo achieve that you\u2019d need a very aggressive points-based system and to accept a lot less temporary labour. That would mean losing single market membership, but also accepting the same restrictions on British people working elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>But he said the research also showed that arguments on both sides of the hotly disputed immigration debate were exaggerated. \u201cPeople who say that everybody benefits from migration automatically are wrong, but so are those who suggest ending migration will solve all our problems.\u201d</p> <p>Overall, the study found that widespread migration into the UK in recent years has had no effect on the wages of British workers, but has caused a \u201cslight drag on wages\u201d in some sectors. </p>",

  "<p>The first question on this year\u2019s exam for the module Introduction to University Finance: \u201cLecturers are taking industrial action over pay and conditions. Students support them in&#xa0;this campaign. Students are protesting against fees and are on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/07/rent-strikes-ucl-students-deepen-inequality\" title=\"\">rent strike</a> arguing for significant rent reductions. The lecturers support them in this campaign. The government is reducing the money it provides for university teaching. The Brexit vote has plunged EU student recruitment, research income and borrowing costs into deep uncertainty. How do you keep everyone&#xa0;happy?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/02/academics-brexit-research-peat-fears-eu-funds\">Academics feel blight of Brexit \u2013 from cancer research to peat projects</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If this really was on an exam paper, chances are that the next morning it would be a national news story as yet another amusing example of those \u201cunanswerable questions\u201d that newspapers love to use to shame those know\u2011all teachers and lecturers.</p> <p>But before we despair, we should recognise that this is simply the latest variant of a question that has appeared over many decades, even if it has become much more acute in recent weeks. Maybe though, we can find inspiration in earlier model answers.</p> <p>Thirty years ago, the popular response was to reduce long-term maintenance costs. If you stop non-essential repairs and refurbishment you can save millions. The problem is that you eventually have to catch up. Building work at universities up and down the country is, in part, making up for years of neglect, urgently regarded as an imperative now students are voting with their \u00a39,000-a-year fees and their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2015/may/25/university-league-tables-2016\" title=\"\">league table</a> influencing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/may/09/student-feedback-waste-of-time\" title=\"\">feedback</a>.</p> <p>Roll forward a few years, and another&#xa0;model answer is to increase recruitment of non-EU high-fee students. Recently, an overseas student asked me whether we charge overseas students so much to try to discourage them from applying. But something like the reverse is true. Just as airlines couldn\u2019t function without business-class passengers paying a premium, many universities would go bust overnight if they couldn\u2019t recruit high-fee students. But with the government reaffirming its plan to reduce immigration, students are an easy target. Visas are ever-harder to obtain and with the removal of post-study work options, signs are that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/03/brexit-vote-cost-uk-universities-tens-millions-student-fees-ucl\" title=\"\">overseas recruitment</a> is already long past its peak. Not much joy there.</p> <p>So we turn to other possible answers. Remember \u201cthird stream\u201d funding? Teaching and research are streams one and two. Industry was going to come to our rescue to provide a third. And it is true that many universities have significant, and highly worthwhile, links with industry. But for most the financial effects are relatively modest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/10/more-than-a-third-of-uk-graduates-regret-attending-university\">More than a third of UK graduates regret attending university</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How about donations? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/15/cambridge-university-launch-fundraising-drive-compete-ivy-league\" title=\"\">UK universities have campaigned to raise money</a>, and, although we are still babies by top US standards, many have drawn in significant gifts. Doesn\u2019t this help lubricate the finances? Well, yes and no (I am an academic, after all). Large donations are of course welcome and highly sought after, but they tend to increase scale of activity, rather than bridge a financial gap. Most gifts are targeted to a specific project, such as a cancer lab, rather than providing cash that can be used to ease the payroll or subsidise student rents. Furthermore, they sometimes come with&#xa0;a demand for matched funding from the university. And where does that come from? But it is almost impossible to turn down a large gift, even if, in cash terms, it can cost the university money to take it.</p> <p>Financial pressures are not going away. Do we need to acknowledge that for the higher education sector, rather like the NHS, a feeling of financial crisis is a normal part of life? The term \u201ccrisis\u201d is dramatic, suggesting unsustainability; the verge of collapse unless urgent action is taken. But as the NHS shows, this is a verge you can occupy for a very long time. Possibly a crisis is simply a situation where a significant number of participants report high levels of dissatisfaction and demand change. But that doesn\u2019t make it sound much better. What it means in practice is that universities will have to decide whether to spread the misery equally, or concentrate it on some groups to the relief of others. So let us hope that this year\u2019s examiners have a&#xa0;new model answer up their sleeves.</p>",

It is important to work with organisers to produce schedules which meet their requirements which is what we have tried to achieve in this case.</p> <p>\u201cSpecifically with regard to the time allowed between the semi-final and final of the 100m, this has been the same in past Games where there was a world record (Atlanta).

Sports broadcasters are often criticised for ignoring female athletes but so far this Olympics, NBC has devoted 58.5% of its coverage to events involving women. That doesn\u2019t quite make up for the inequality in nearly every other sports broadcast but it\u2019s perhaps exposes the old argument that people won\u2019t tune in to watch women\u2019s sport. There are a few reasons NBC has decided to go down this road - women\u2019s gymnastics is always a huge draw, particularly this year with the brilliant Simone Biles, while American women have excelled in the pool. Then there\u2019s the viewers themselves: NBC says 55% of its audience for the Olympics is female.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5892e76add16c1070f293734ce0e433eb414f20c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5892e76add16c1070f293734ce0e433eb414f20c/0_0_5184_3558/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yilin Fan begins the balance beam final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yilin Fan begins the balance beam final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lars Baron/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-15T18:56:18.417Z\">at 7.56pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b20df3e4b062ce4d223a39\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-15T18:49:04.905Z\">7.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So Fan Yilin starts, and looks nervous - she\u2019s a bit shaky on some of her landings, but does some very nice gear at the same time.

First middleweight Michael O\u2019Reilly was sent home after failing a drug test, then medal contender Paddy Barnes had a shock defeat in the first round of the light-fly category. Now Katie Taylor, invincible at lightweight four years ago and considered Ireland\u2019s best hope of gold, has gone out at the quarter-final stage to Finland\u2019s Mira Potkonen. This succession of failures will doubtless be blamed on the loss of head coach Billy Walsh to the US team last autumn, which caused a huge furore.

These were in the rowing, for the coxless pairs and the 4s. These two gold medals were won on the same day in an hour, on August 13. I do believe that with Max Whitlock winning his two gold medals in gymnastics yesterday (almost exactly 84 years to the day!) he becomes the first GB athlete to win those consecutive golds on the same day since Hugh Edwards. I\u2019ve not seen it reported on at all \u2013 which is not too surprising as the story of Jumbo\u2019s exploits in 1932 are not well known, he is a lot more renowned for his coaching of Oxford in the 1950s and 60s.<br></p> <p> Here is a very short biography and his <a href=\"https://www.olympic.org/en/Home/News/News/2015/05/18/21/20/25/Jumbo%20rows%20to%20victory\">exploits as a Wing Commander in World War II and rowing through a minefield to save his life</a>.</p> <p>Jumbo\u2019s story is astounding, and his two gold medals (Britain only won 4 events in 1932) were not reported on back home \u2013 other than a brief mention beside the cricket results.

He didn\u2019t. Before the race began <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/usainbolt\">Usain Bolt</a> said that the only question in his head was whether he should take it easy in the 100m final so he could spare himself for the longer sprints next week. He has his heart set, you see, on trying to break the 19 second barrier in the 200m. The big worry, Bolt explained, wasn\u2019t that this plan might make him vulnerable to his fellow competitors, but rather that it may upset his public. \u201cShould I run the 100m just to win and save my energy for the 200m?\u201d he explained. \u201cIf I shut it down in the 100, will people be happy? I don\u2019t know.\u201d He shouldn\u2019t have worried. They love him what ever he does. And no one much minded that his time of 9.81sec was his slowest in an Olympic final, and short of his own superhuman standards.</p> <p>As Bolt said, \u201cit wasn\u2019t a perfect race, but the fact is that I won, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re all here for.\u201d The sad thing was the Olympic Stadium wasn\u2019t actually full. There were some conspicuous blue blotches of empty seats in the ends behind the bends, even after Bolt himself had urged his Twitter followers to buy up tickets. But it was as close to capacity as it is going to get. By six o\u2019clock, when the hills surrounding Engenho de Dentro, were backlit brilliant red by the sunset, the queue already wound round two sides of the stadium. More fans were pouring off every train and bus out from downtown. Once they were in, they roared their appreciation for each little thing he did, giving ovations to every wink and wag of his finger.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/ever-the-entertainer-usain-bolt-plays-conductor-to-olympic-orchestra\">Read the full story here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b16af9e4b0c23bfed8995b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-15T07:15:46.619Z\">8.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Every gold rush needs a spark right?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/gb-max-whitlock-floor-gold-gymnastics-rio-olympics\">And Great Britain\u2019s yesterday was undoubtedly Max Whitlock</a>.

  "<p>As Labour nationally sinks into an internecine slough, it is easy to forget how emphatically it passed its biggest electoral test since the general election as recently as 5 May this year. Sadiq Khan\u2019s triumph over Conservative Zac Goldsmith strengthened Labour\u2019s dominance in the capital despite a heavily negative Tory campaign. </p> <p>In his first 100 days at City Hall, while assembling his team and pressing ahead with initiatives on policing, air quality and the workings of Transport for London (TfL), much of Khan\u2019s focus has been on lobbying the Conservative government for resources and devolved powers to nurture London\u2019s economy. </p> <p>The uncertainties caused by Brexit, which Khan strongly opposed, have added urgency to this: the prime minister, Theresa May, will be well aware that the UK depends heavily on London\u2019s generation of wealth and taxes. Khan, who said early in the election campaign that he intended to be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/jan/09/london-mayor-race-the-new-labour-flavour-of-sadiq-khan\">the most business-friendly mayor of all time</a>\u201d, has responded to the EU referendum outcome by joining with the City of London and others in a campaign to demonstrate that \u201cLondon Is Open\u201d for global trade and visitors as before.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is now impossible to imagine anyone more suitable for his job</p> <footer> <cite>Evening Standard</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A backdrop of the shock of Brexit in a city that voted 60% to remain and Labour\u2019s turmoil under Jeremy Corbyn may have enhanced Khan\u2019s honeymoon, with even the Evening Standard, which facilitated many of the Goldsmith campaign\u2019s attacks, declaring in a recent feature that it is now \u201cimpossible to imagine anyone more suitable\u201d for his job. </p> <p>Claims that Khan, an observant Muslim and former civil rights lawyer, had provided, in Goldsmith\u2019s word, \u201ccover\u201d to Islamist fanatics in the past, now seem as shrill as they had felt menacing at the time. Apart from calling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/10/sadiq-khan-i-dont-want-ignorant-donald-trump-to-make-me-an-exception\">Donald Trump\u2019s view of Islam ignorant</a> and being the star speaker at the annual Eid event in Trafalgar Square, Khan\u2019s religion has become a background theme. Addressing the Pride in London parade and giving senior jobs to women have underlined his social liberalism. A self-declared \u201cproud feminist\u201d, he has announced an end to \u201cbody\u2013shaming\u201d adverts on the Tube and bus network. </p> <p>Soon he will need bigger achievements. This Friday\u2019s launch of a 24-hour service on two of London\u2019s underground lines is a delayed Boris Johnson policy. Khan\u2019s new \u201chopper\u201d bus fare, which will allow passengers two journeys for the price of one within a 60-minute window, will start in September, though Khan has faced claims that his pledge to freeze public transport fares for four years was misleading, as it will not, as things stand, apply to travelcards, whose prices are set by the Department for Transport. More detail about his affordable housing plans is awaited, and Londoners will soon be looking for evidence of solid progress in all key policy areas. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/aug/15/sadiq-khans-first-100-days-london-mayor-brexit\">Sure-footed start but trials ahead: Sadiq Khan's first 100 days as London mayor</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Devolution</strong></h2> <p>Khan is seeking more control for the mayoralty and London\u2019s local authorities over investment in housing and transport, the running of health and social care services, skills and further education, property taxes and suburban rail services in order to use the capital\u2019s resources better. He has revived Johnson\u2019s London Finance Commission to look at further powers that might be devolved. Khan has demanded a seat for London at the Brexit negotiations, stressing the importance of continued full access to the European single market. He likes the idea of a London-only work visa for migrant workers. </p> <h2><strong>Housing</strong></h2> <p>Khan\u2019s choice of housing chief, James Murray, perturbed some commercial developers, housing associations and even other Labour boroughs, who saw the former Islington councillor as an oppositional left hardliner. However, Murray has been bringing his grasp of London\u2019s complex housing equations to bear on the practicalities of delivering more \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d homes to rent or buy \u2013 a forthcoming more stringent definition of \u201caffordable\u201d than used by Johnson or the government \u2013 and building bridges across the housing sector.</p> <p>A manifesto goal of making 50% of all new homes \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d has been mildly finessed into a \u201clong-term strategic target\u201d and Khan has so far declined to set a straight numerical target. But an intervention in the vast Old Oak redevelopment scheme in the west of the city to increase the affordable element planned there showed intent, and he is eager to get building on public land, notably sites owned by TfL. Persuading Jules Pipe, the mayor of Hackney, to become his planning deputy should help pull all the development threads together as Khan tries to meet soaring demand for not only homes but also schools, health facilities and transport infrastructure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c061d02afc331ac4161156e805f5625ddc5daf3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c061d02afc331ac4161156e805f5625ddc5daf3e/0_643_3558_4448/800.jpg\" alt=\"Val Shawcross, Khan\u2019s transport deputy, is a champion of public transport\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Val Shawcross, Khan\u2019s transport deputy, is a champion of public transport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Transport</strong></h2> <p>Former Labour London assembly member Val Shawcross is Khan\u2019s experienced choice as transport deputy. She has committed to introducing a long-awaited pedestrianisation scheme in Oxford Street by 2020, along with more active travel initiatives (essentially, walking and cycling). Shawcross is a champion of public transport \u2013 especially the somewhat neglected bus service \u2013 and understands the complex, some say opaque, finances of TfL, which Khan wants overhauled. </p> <h2><strong>Policing and security</strong></h2> <p>Khan countered campaign claims such as that by the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, that he was unfit to be mayor at a time of terrorist threat because he had in the past criticised British foreign policy, by proclaiming himself \u201cthe British Muslim who will take the fight to the extremists\u201d. He has welcomed the forthcoming increase in armed police patrolling London. In line with a pledge to strengthen community policing, he has vowed to introduce a second dedicated beat constable to each of London\u2019s 629 electoral wards by the end of 2017. </p> <h2><strong>Air pollution</strong></h2> <p>A consultation has been conducted on proposals for reducing the number of polluting vehicles driving in London, which has serious air quality problems. Khan has already been bolder than Johnson, producing plans that include extending and bringing forward implementation of the central London ultra low emission zone. This has pleased environmentalists, though they will watch carefully to see how far he eventually goes.</p>",

Thank you.</p> <h2>The big picture</h2> <p>Uncertainty and confusion \u2013 so what\u2019s new? \u2013 reigned again last week, over what form Brexit might take and when it might happen. The government is reportedly still more than a year away from even beginning the actual exit process. </p> <p>What with a Westminster turf war (see below) and the complete absence of any prep work for the referendum outcome, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-timing-idUSKCN10O0Y9\">the Sunday Times</a> said, the situation was so chaotic that ministers are not now envisaging starting formal two-year exit talks until late next year, delaying the UK\u2019s exit until the end of 2019.</p> <p>The two new government departments created to handle Brexit and the multiple highly complex new trade deals Britain needs to negotiate are far from being fully functional, lacking basic office infrastructure \u2013 and most of their staff.</p> <p>David Davis\u2019s Department for Exiting the European Union did <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/545007/Department_for_Exiting_the_EU_-_Senior_Management_Team.pdf\">publish details of its senior management team last week</a> but has so far made only 110 of its 250 planned hires, while Liam Fox\u2019s Department for International Trade has fewer than 100 of the 500-plus negotiators it is seeking. </p> <p>Besides the critical question of Britain\u2019s readiness (or not) to trigger article 50, delaying the fatal moment until the end of next year would also \u2013 with Dutch, French and German elections all coming up \u2013 mean the government at least knows who else will be round the negotiating table. </p> <p>And the growing frustration of assorted pro-Brexiters notwithstanding, a longer delay in triggering article 50 would be no bad thing \u2013 because the UK is still nowhere near working out what kind of trade model with Europe it should seek. </p> <p>Norway dropped a bit of a bombshell on that front, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/norway-may-block-uk-return-to-european-free-trade-association\">raising serious questions about the feasibility</a> of one option for single market membership that was widely touted in the pro-Brexit camp running up to the referendum.</p> <p>As a member of the <a href=\"http://www.efta.int/\">European Free Trade Association</a>, Norway is part of the single market without being a member of the EU. But Elisabeth Vik Aspaker, its European affairs minister, told Aftenposten: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s not certain that it would be a good idea to let a big country into this organisation. It would shift the balance, which is not necessarily in Norway\u2019s interests. </p> </blockquote> <p>Canadian officials, too, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/brexit-canada-trade-deal-eu-model-next-steps\">have confessed they are at a loss to understand</a> why their country\u2019s 1,600-page agreement with Brussels, which took seven full years to negotiate, should be seen as a potential blueprint in London:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t understand [the Canada deal] as the answer to Brexit when the British will be taking a 43-year step backwards in terms of the current access they have to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">European Union</a>. </p> </blockquote> <p>Whatever trade model Britain does eventually manage to agree with Europe, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), one of the country\u2019s leading thinktanks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/10/uk-membership-european-single-market-worth-4-more-gdp-eu-referendum-economy\">left no one in any doubt as to what it thought would be best for the economy</a>. </p> <p>Britain could of course enjoy the same sort of access to the EU\u2019s single market on the same World Trade Organisation terms as other non-EU member states such as the US, China or India, the IFS said \u2013 but full membership of the single market is worth an additional 4% of GDP to the economy. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cdd3ab53693e048e9254140fc517b5a184966ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cdd3ab53693e048e9254140fc517b5a184966ee/0_0_5422_3615/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Canary Wharf in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Canary Wharf in London. Britain\u2019s financial services sector has profited from access to the single market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The catch, of course, particularly for Britain\u2019s all-important financial services sector, is that outside the EU single market membership will come at the cost of accepting future regulations the UK will not have helped devise. Ian Mitchell, the report\u2019s author, warned bluntly: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We still face some very big choices indeed in terms of our future relationship with the EU. There is all the difference in the world between \u2018access to\u2019 and \u2018membership of\u2019 the single market.</p> </blockquote> <p>Thankfully, though, the chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/13/philip-hammond-treasury-to-guarantee-post-brexit-funding-for-eu-backed-projects\">Philip Hammond, reassured everyone who currently receives EU funding</a> that they will not \u2013 for the time being, anyway \u2013 lose out as a result of the referendum vote. <br></p> <p>Hammond said government would guarantee billions of pounds for current and pending scientific research, agricultural subsidies and \u2013 as long as they are agreed before the autumn statement \u2013 structural and investment projects . </p> <p>Campaigners including <a href=\"http://scientistsforeu.uk/2016/08/press-release-philip-hammond-guarantees-eu-funding/\">Scientists for EU welcomed the announcement but said it was a stopgap measure</a> that covered \u201cthe bare essentials, and no more\u201d. Longer term measures would be complex and critical, they added: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After that, we must tackle the longer term issues of immigration policies, shared infrastructure and regulations, national funding, and the future relationship of the UK with the EU science programmes.</p> </blockquote> <h2>The view from Europe</h2> <p>It\u2019s August. Europe is on holiday. But a former Danish foreign minister popped up to warn \u2013 as the man who negotiated Greenland\u2019s departure from the EU after it gained autonomy from Denmark and voted to leave in 1982 \u2013 that Brexit would not be a walk in the park. <br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-09/brexit-timeline-illusions-exposed-in-unusual-tale-of-greenland\">Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, now 74, told Bloomberg</a> it took Greenland, which has a population of 56,000, only one real industry (fishing) and whose laws, customs and institutions were barely entwined with the EU\u2019s at all, three years to get out: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Negotiating Greenland\u2019s exit was a fairly simple task that resulted in a relatively simple and easy to understand protocol. Britain will take much longer; it\u2019s impossible to say how long. Basically, the British need to understand what an enormous task they took upon themselves.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Meanwhile, back in Westminster</h2> <p>There\u2019s trouble at Brexit Towers and it\u2019s not just a squabble over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/18/boris-johnson-forced-to-share-mansion-with-liam-fox-and-david-davis\">use of the Chevening mansion</a> shared by foreign secretary Boris Johnson, Fox and Davis. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/14/liam-fox-attempt-wrest-control-foreign-office-duties-boris-johnson\">Fox made an audacious power grab</a> to bring key parts of the Foreign Office (FCO) remit under the umbrella of his new department, asking Johnson and the prime minister, Theresa May, for a restructuring to give him responsibility for economic diplomacy \u2013 a move given short shrift by No 10 and the FCO, which has nonetheless agreed to second some expert staff to the new department. </p> <p>That capped off an embarrassing week for Fox\u2019s department. On Friday, it hastily removed from its website a press release published \u201cin error\u201d that appeared to announce that the UK would still trade with the EU under WTO rules after leaving the bloc, \u201cuntil any new trade deals are negotiated\u201d. <br></p> <p>Economists quickly pointed out that such a move would be hugely damaging for businesses, who would be subject to steep tariffs on goods exported to the EU \u2013 including a 10% duty on cars and 12% on clothing \u2013 and would have no access to the EU\u2019s service or financial service markets. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn remains streets ahead in nominations for the Labour party leadership, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/15/jeremy-corbyn-wins-backing-84-per-cent-local-labour-parties\">taking 84% of local party nominations</a> and endorsements from the UK\u2019s two largest unions. </p> <p>One group whose support he has not won, however, is the Labour Movement for Europe, chaired by the former party leader Neil Kinnock. The Labour affiliate nominated Corbyn\u2019s rival Owen Smith by 10 to one.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/15/neil-kinnock-condemns-corbyn-for-silence-or-ignorance-over-brexit\">In an article for the Guardian, Kinnock accused the Labour leader</a> of \u201cignorance, lack of concern, or willingness to let the Tory Brexiters run amok\u201d, and said he believed the referendum result could have been different if a Labour leader had made a passionate case for remain. </p> <p>Kinnock said Labour needed a leader who was \u201cup to the task\u201d of having a key role in shaping the UK\u2019s relations with the EU. Smith, he said, could play that role. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b84f0d5c80a89e2160b88b8920a47834bd89e71a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b84f0d5c80a89e2160b88b8920a47834bd89e71a/0_276_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Kinnock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil Kinnock, who had harsh words for Jeremy Corbyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>You should also know that:</h2> <ul> <li>The Scottish government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/scottish-government-to-spend-100m-to-cushion-post-brexit-vote-effects  \">said it would spend \u00a3100m on cushioning the after-effects of Brexit</a>.</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/uk-could-clinch-trade-deal-with-eu-within-two-years-says-expert\">One of Britain\u2019s most experienced former trade negotiators said</a> the UK may succeed in negotiating a trade deal with Brussels within two years, but reckons the EU \u201cis not going to yield\u201d on free movement.<br></li> <li>A lecturer in international law has warned that UK businesses with a legal case against an EU company \u2013 supplier or customer \u2013 that is in breach of its contract <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/commercial-disputes-that-cross-borders-will-be-a-major-headache-after-brexit-63623\">are going to be in trouble once Britain leaves</a>.</li> <li>In a rare piece of post-Brexit good news (for some), <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ccc9948-5fbc-11e6-ae3f-77baadeb1c93\">the market in fine Bordeaux wine has taken off</a>: much of the stuff is held in bonded warehouses in the UK, and the 10% fall in sterling is working wonders on demand.</li> </ul> <h2>Read these </h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/the-brexit-hangover-just-got-worse\">In Vanity Fair, Henry Porter describes Brexit</a> as \u201can operation that will likely be worse than amputation without anaesthetic\u201d, observing trenchantly that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What is becoming clear is that the UK is much more entangled with the European Union than the Brexit campaigners ever admitted \u2013 or even understood \u2013 at the time of the referendum ...

The procedure is being tested at a secret facility in New Mexico, where traumatised veterans re-enact combat scenes while doped up on a horse sedative called Tripizoid. It doesn\u2019t work \u2013 surprise \u2013 and soon runaway patients are bringing mayhem to American streets already lawless with biker gangs and riots.</p> <p>We focus on one of these fugitive \u201cenfolds\u201d, Rake, a murderous psychopath who rampages around the&#xa0;midwest, daubing pentagrams with&#xa0;the blood of his victims. He abducts a mentally ill woman, Meg, and&#xa0;coerces her into abetting his crimes before imprisoning her at a woodland hideout. On Rake\u2019s tail are&#xa0;two lovestruck agents from a shadowy federal agency: Singleton (another enfolded vet) and Wendy, described as a \u201cstrange mix of kindness&#xa0;and care and wildness\u201d.</p> <p>The action takes place in short segments that cut between Meg\u2019s point of view and Singleton\u2019s. Pace isn\u2019t the object: Means deliberately avoids clarity and spends a lot of time outlining his alternative reality in a vortex of fiddly counterfactuals, chiefly to do with the assassination of JFK, reconfigured in ways that prove less important than billed. It\u2019s also stated from the outset that the events summarised above are merely what happens in \u201cHystopia\u201d \u2013 a posthumously published novel by a 22-year-old Vietnam veteran who committed suicide after the death of his&#xa0;mentally ill sister, Meg.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/01/slade-house-david-mitchell-review-haunted-house\">Slade House by David Mitchell review \u2013 gleeful, skin-crawling brilliance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Means throws the kitchen sink at disorienting the reader, <em>Hystopia</em> eventually boils down to a tricked-out chase narrative. Even the odder elements of his scenario have pretty familiar effects. The so-called enfolds are able to access their repressed memories through orgasm, which elevates \u201csexposition\u201d to new heights of absurdity \u2013 as Means well knows. \u201cAll that conveniently in your unfold,\u201d says Wendy, as Singleton unburdens himself mid-clinch.</p> <p>The wink is typical. Introducing the novel-within-a-novel, supposedly published in 1974, the anonymous editor tells us it was \u201chardly fit for the fiction market at the time (or at any time) but was publishable because of&#xa0;the marketability of the so-called backstory\u201d.</p> <p>That multi-level joke aims partly to reassure any readers who may feel lost in the darkness of a novel that gambles heavily on you sticking around until the lights go up. The slow trickle of revelations, punctuated by sex and bloodletting, leads in the end to an explanation of why \u201cHystopia\u201d was written in the first place; as a character study in which the lead character never&#xa0;appears, it\u2019s certainly clever.

  "<p>The Republican party, its leaders like to say, is a party of ideas. Debates over budgets and government programmes are important, but they must be conducted with an eye on the bigger questions \u2013 questions about the character of the state, the future of freedom and the meaning of virtue. These beliefs provide the foundation for a conservative intellectual establishment \u2013 thinktanks such as the American Enterprise Institute, magazines such as National Review, pundits such as George Will and Bill Kristol \u2013 dedicated to advancing the right\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>Over the last year, that establishment has been united by one thing: opposition to Donald Trump. Republican voters may have succumbed to a temporary bout of collective insanity \u2013 or so Trump\u2019s critics on the right believe \u2013 but the party\u2019s intelligentsia remain certain that entrusting the Republican nomination to a reality television star turned populist demagogue has been a disaster for their cause and their country. Whatever Trump might be, he is not a conservative.</p> <p>That belief is comforting, but it is wrong. Trump is a unique character, but the principles he defends and the passions he inflames have been part of the modern American right since its formation in the aftermath of the second world war. Most conservative thinkers have forgotten or repressed this part of their history, which is why they are undergoing a collective nervous breakdown today. Like addicts the morning after a bender, they are baffled at the face they see in the mirror.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/the-past-present-and-future-of-trumpism\">The past, present and future of Trumpism | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But not all of the right\u2019s intellectuals have been so blind.

Posts analysing the campaign with titles such as The Twilight of Jeb! alternated with more ambitious forays in philosophy such as Paleo-Straussianism, Part I: Metaphysics and Epistemology. More intellectually demanding than the typical National Review article, the style of their prose also suggested writers who were having fun. Disquisitions on Aristotle could be followed by an emoji mocking the latest outraged responses to Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/sep/02/the-dark-history-of-donald-trumps-rightwing-revolt-podcast\">The dark history of Donald Trump's rightwing revolt \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The authors at JAG were not all backing Trump himself \u2013 officially, they were \u201celectorally agnostic\u201d \u2013 but they were united by their enthusiasm for Trumpism (as they put it, \u201cfor what Trumpism could become if thought through with wisdom and moderation\u201d). They dismissed commentators who attributed Trump\u2019s victory to his celebrity, arguing that a campaign could not resonate with so many voters unless it spoke to genuine public concerns.</p> <p>JAG condensed Trumpism into three key elements: economic nationalism, controlled borders and a foreign policy that put American interests first.</p> <p>These policies, they asserted, were a direct challenge to the views of America\u2019s new ruling class \u2013 a cosmopolitan elite of wealthy professionals who controlled the commanding heights of public discourse. This new ruling class of \u201ctransnational post-Americans\u201d was united by its belief that the welfare of the world just happened to coincide with programmes that catered to its own self-interest: free trade, open borders, globalisation and a suite of other policies designed to ease the transition to a post-national future overseen by enlightened experts. In the language of JAG, they are the \u201cDavoisie\u201d, a global elite that is most at ease among its international peers at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/21/-sp-davos-guide-world-economic-forum\">World Economic Forum</a> in Davos and totally out of touch with ordinary Americans.</p> <p>Mainstream conservatives and their liberal counterparts were equally complicit in sustaining this regime, but JAG focused its attention on the right. Leading Republican politicians and the journalists who fawned over them in the rightwing press were pedlars of an \u201cintellectually bankrupt\u201d doctrine whose obsessions \u2013 cutting taxes, policing sexual norms, slashing government regulation \u2013 distracted from \u201cthe fundamental question\u201d Trump had put on the agenda: \u201cdestruction of the soulless managerial class\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A dissenting minority has been waging a guerrilla war against the conservative establishment for three decades</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>JAG unleashed salvo after salvo against \u201cConservatism Inc\u201d, the network of journals and thinktanks that, along with talk radio and Fox News, has made defending the party of ideas into a lucrative career path. \u201cIf Trump ends up destroying the Republican party,\u201d they wrote, \u201cit is because the Republican party, as it exists today, is little more than a jobs programme for failed academics and journalists.\u201d</p> <p>News of JAG began circulating on the right shortly after its debut early in the primary season. \u201cThe first time I heard someone refer to it, I thought it was a joke,\u201d says former George W Bush speechwriter David Frum. But it quickly found an audience. \u201cThey got a huge response almost immediately,\u201d says conservative activist Chris Buskirk, who recalled excited emails and frantic texting among his colleagues. In June, the Wall Street Journal columnist and former Ronald Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan alerted her readers to the \u201csophisticated, rather brilliant and anonymous website\u201d. A link from the popular rightwing website Breitbart News drove traffic even higher, and JAG seemed poised to shape the discussion over the future of conservatism.</p> <p>Then it disappeared. Months of posts, totalling more than 175,000 words, were scrubbed from the internet, replaced by <a href=\"http://journalofamericangreatness.blogspot.co.uk/\">a note labelling the site an \u201cinside joke\u201d </a>that had spiralled out of control. Within the right, rumours swirled about the real motives behind the vanishing act; fans of JAG took its self-immolation as further evidence that the conservative establishment would not tolerate any dissent. But the brief life of the Journal of American Greatness did more than provide grist for feverish speculation on Twitter. Patrolling the boundaries of acceptable thought on the right has always been one of the central duties of the conservative intellectual, and JAG\u2019s voluntary purging was the latest chapter in a long battle to define the meaning of conservatism.</p> <p>Conservatives tend to portray their cause as the child of a revolt against the liberal status quo that began in the aftermath of the second world war, gained momentum in the 1950s when a cohort of intellectuals supplied the right with its philosophical underpinning, attained political consciousness in Barry Goldwater\u2019s 1964 presidential campaign, and won vindication with Ronald Reagan\u2019s election to the White House. Ideas have consequences, they proclaimed. Just look at us.</p> <p>But there is another way of interpreting the history of the American right, one that puts less emphasis on the power of ideas and more on power itself \u2013 a history of white voters fighting to defend their place in the social hierarchy, politicians appealing to the prejudices of their constituents so they can satisfy the wishes of their donors, and the industry that has turned conservatism into a billion-dollar business.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"ae7d7b44419c18020b88dc87a97c874e7ed3802a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae7d7b44419c18020b88dc87a97c874e7ed3802a/0_168_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White segregationist demonstrators protesting at the admission of the Little Rock Nine, to Central High School, 1959\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White segregationist demonstrators protesting in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1959.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the explanation preferred by leftwing critics, who typically regard the Republican party as a coalition fuelled by white nationalism and funded by billionaires. But this line of attack also has a long history on the right, where a dissenting minority has been waging a guerrilla war against the conservative establishment for three decades. Now the unlikely figure of Donald Trump has brought in a wave of reinforcements \u2013 over 13 million in the primaries alone. Their target is the managerial elite, and their history begins in the run-up to the second world war, when a forgotten founder of modern American conservatism became a public sensation with a book that announced the dawning of a civilisation ruled by experts.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The Managerial Revolution: What Is Happening in the World was the most unlikely bestseller of 1941. The author, James Burnham, was a philosophy professor at New York University who until the previous year had been one of Leon Trotsky\u2019s most trusted counsellors in the US. Time called Burnham\u2019s work a grim outline of \u201cthe totalitarian world soon to come\u201d that was \u201cas morbidly fascinating as a textbook vivisection\u201d.</p> <p>The son of a wealthy railway executive, Burnham graduated near the top of his class in Princeton in 1927 before studying at Oxford and then securing his post at NYU. But the Great Depression radicalised him, and he began a double life, lecturing on Aquinas by day and polemicising against capital by night. By 1940, Burnham had lost his faith in the revolution of the proletariat. While Trotsky denounced his erstwhile disciple as an \u201ceducated witch doctor\u201d, Burnham started work on the book that would justify his apostasy.</p> <p>According to Burnham, Marxists were right to anticipate capitalism\u2019s imminent demise but wrong about what would come next. Around the turn of the 20th century, he claimed, the scale of life had changed. Population growth surged, immense corporations gobbled up smaller rivals, and government officials struggled to expand their powers to match the growing size of the challenges they faced.</p> <p>These structural changes fundamentally altered the distribution of power in society. In the 18th century, authority had rested with aristocrats; in the 19th century with capitalists; in the 20th century it had passed on to the managers, whose authority derived from their unique ability to operate the complex institutions that now dominated mass society.</p> <p>Technocrats had become the new ruling class. According to Burnham, fascism, Stalinism and Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal were all products of this transformation, and there was no use struggling against the world that was coming into being \u2013 a world where state ownership of the means of production had become the norm, where sovereignty had shifted to a bureaucratic elite, and where the globe was divided into rival superstates.</p> <p>Burnham was not the first to foresee a society run by managers, but the arguments he borrowed from others took on a different meaning when brought together in this form. His sweep was global, his narrative reached back centuries, and he almost seemed to welcome a totalitarian future. For Burnham, the only sensible response to the managerial revolution was to recognise that it had occurred and accept there was no point in trying to bring back a world that was already lost. This bleak forecast captured the public imagination. Fortune called it \u201cthe most debated book published so far this year\u201d and it went on to sell more than 200,000 copies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"aa3e0ba00d4ccf09fa0677b95894a780e68dac59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa3e0ba00d4ccf09fa0677b95894a780e68dac59/0_115_1992_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard C Levin with William F Buckley Jr, Yale University, 2000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William F Buckley Jr collects an honorary doctorate from Yale University, 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Child/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Burnham quickly moved on to new territory. His true subject, he concluded, was power, and to understand power he needed a theory of politics. Marx had been his guiding influence in The Managerial Revolution; now he turned to Machiavelli, constructing the genealogy of a political theory that began with the author of The Prince and continued into the present.</p> <p>For a Machiavellian, Burnham wrote, politics was an unending war for dominance: democracy was a myth, and all ideologies were thinly veiled rationalisations for self-interest. The great mass of humanity, in Burnham\u2019s dark vision, would never have any control over their own lives. They could only hope that clashes between rival elites might weaken the power of the ruling class and open up small spaces of freedom.</p> <p>Burnham\u2019s newfound zeal for defending freedom led him, in 1955, to a conservative magazine called National Review, and to the magazine\u2019s charismatic young founder, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/business/media/27cnd-buckley.html?_r=0\">William F Buckley Jr</a>. Buckley\u2019s goal was to turn a scattered collection of reactionaries into the seeds of a movement. His journal set out to make the right intellectually respectable, stripping it of the associations with kooks and cranks that allowed liberals to depict it as a politics for cave-dwellers who had not reconciled themselves to modernity. Burnham was there at the start, one of five senior editors on the masthead of the first issue.</p> <p>Soon Burnham was Buckley\u2019s ranking deputy. But in an editorial staff riven by abstract debates between ardent libertarians and devout Christians, Burnham was the pragmatist who urged his colleagues not to ask politicians for more than the electorate would accept. For the right to win over working-class voters, Burnham argued, the movement had to embrace a more populist economic policy \u2013 contrary to the wishes of his anti-statist colleagues and their corporate backers, who wanted to lower taxes on the rich and roll back the welfare state. \u201cMuch of conservative doctrine,\u201d Burnham wrote in 1972, \u201cis, if not quite bankrupt, more and more obviously obsolescent.\u201d Less than a decade later, Ronald Reagan was president, and it was Burnham who seemed like a relic of the past.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>For a long time, the only major study of Burnham\u2019s work was a slim volume published in 1984 by a minor academic press under the title Power and History. The book\u2019s author, Samuel Francis, seemed a typical product of the insurgent conservative movement Burnham had helped to create \u2013 though by the late 1990s, when Francis published an updated version of Power and History, it made more sense to speak of a new conservative establishment. Outsiders who arrived at the White House with Reagan had become senior executives in Conservatism Inc. With the end of the cold war, the right had lost the glue that had bound its coalition, but there were still battles to be waged, and the money was better than ever.</p> <p>Francis was never going to become a star in the emerging rightwing infotainment complex. Shy and overweight, with teeth stained from smoking, he had difficulty making it through cocktail parties. After completing a PhD in British history at the University of North Carolina, Francis left academia for Washington \u2013 first working at a rightwing thinktank, then serving as an aide to a Republican senator, and finally joining the editorial staff of the capital\u2019s influential conservative daily newspaper, the Washington Times.</p> <p>Francis retained his academic interests while he ascended into the ranks of the conservative establishment. He published six books in his lifetime, but he worked in private on one massive volume that he hoped would bring together all the disparate strands of his thought. Finished in 1995 but not discovered until after his death a decade later, the result was published earlier this year under the title Leviathan and Its Enemies. It is a sprawling text, more than 700 pages long, digressive, repetitive and in desperate need of an editor.</p> <p>It is also one of the most impressive books to come out of the American right in a generation \u2013 and the most frightening. It is a searching diagnosis of managerial society, written by an author looking for a strategy that could break it apart.</p> <p>Like much of Francis\u2019s writing, Leviathan and Its Enemies began with Burnham \u2013 in this case, quite literally. \u201cThis book,\u201d Francis announced in the first sentence, \u201cis an effort to revise and reformulate the theory of the managerial revolution as advanced by James Burnham in 1941.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Paleoconservatives depicted themselves as spokesmen for the forgotten residents of flyover country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Francis agreed that society had been taken over by managers, but he believed the new ruling class was far more vulnerable than Burnham had realised. Not everyone had benefited from the rise of the experts \u2013 and Francis saw this unequal distribution of rewards as the managerial regime\u2019s greatest weakness.</p> <p>For reasons he never quite explained, he insisted that the cosmopolitan elite threatened the traditional values cherished by most Americans: \u201cmorality and religion, family, nation, local community, and at times racial integrity and identity\u201d. These were sacred principles for members of a new \u201cpost-bourgeois proletariat\u201d drawn from the working class and the lower ranks of the middle class. Lacking the skills prized by technocrats, but not far enough down the social ladder to win the attention of reformers, these white voters considered themselves victims of a coalition between the top and bottom against the middle.</p> <p>According to Francis, this cohort had supplied the animating spirit of rightwing politics since the death of Franklin Roosevelt in 1945. They had supported Goldwater \u2013 but Francis regarded Goldwater\u2019s programme, like the \u201cmovement conservatism\u201d of the National Review, as a \u201cquaintly bourgeois\u201d throwback to the oligarchic politics of the 19th century, with nothing to offer the modern working man. Their tribune was not Goldwater but <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/14/us/george-wallace-segregation-symbol-dies-at-79.html?pagewanted=all\">George Wallace</a>, the notorious segregationist and Democratic governor of Alabama \u2013 who won five southern states as an anti-civil rights third-party candidate in the 1968 presidential election. Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan had appealed to this group, too, but neglected their interests after taking office. Despite having elected multiple presidents, the post-bourgeois proletariat had yet to find a voice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"b9f9fe228b411a3f9b75c94215a7aaa10509c370\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9f9fe228b411a3f9b75c94215a7aaa10509c370/76_16_2917_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Third-party presidential candidate George Wallace campaigns in Boston, 1968\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Third-party presidential candidate George Wallace campaigns in Boston, 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet Francis had difficulty explaining why managerial society would generate so much opposition in the first place. In Leviathan and Its Enemies, he argued that resistance to the cosmopolitan elite would be driven by \u201cimmutable elements of human nature\u201d that \u201cnecessitate attachment to the concrete and historical roots of moral values and meaning\u201d.</p> <p>He was more candid in a speech he gave while working on the book. \u201cWhat we as whites must do,\u201d he declared, \u201cis reassert our identity and our solidarity, and we must do so in explicitly racial terms through the articulation of a racial consciousness as whites.\u201d Where mainstream conservatives depicted the US as a nation whose diverse population was linked by devotion to its founding principles, Francis viewed it as a racial project inextricably bound up with white rule. The managerial revolution jeopardised this racial hierarchy, and so it must be overthrown.</p> <p>Francis delivered his remarks on racial consciousness at a conference organised by <a href=\"http://www.amren.com/\">American Renaissance</a>, an obscure journal devoted to promoting white nationalism. Years earlier, Francis had struck up a friendship with Jared Taylor, who went on to found the magazine with Francis\u2019s encouragement. From their first encounter, Taylor recalled, he and Francis \u201cunderstood each other immediately\u201d.</p> <p>Francis\u2019s employers at the Washington Times were not as sympathetic. The paper fired him after his comments were released, a move that was part of his larger expulsion from the respectable right. Buckley himself dismissed Francis as \u201cspokesman\u201d for a group that had \u201cearned their exclusion from thoughtful conservative ranks\u201d.</p> <p>Yet Francis would not be so easily purged. For years he had cultivated a relationship with Pat Buchanan, a one-time Nixon protege who had become one of the country\u2019s most recognisable conservatives thanks to his role as co-host of CNN\u2019s popular debating programme Crossfire. In 1992, Buchanan launched a long-shot campaign against incumbent president George HW Bush that, against all expectations, garnered almost 3m votes in the primaries. While all this was going on, Buchanan was growing closer to Francis, whom he later called \u201cperhaps the brightest and best thinker on the right\u201d.</p> <p>Francis and Buchanan were linked by their association with a breakaway faction on the right known as paleoconservatism. While mainstream conservatives had taken advantage of cushy gigs in New York and Washington, paleocons depicted themselves as spokesmen for the forgotten residents of <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/03/160314-flyover-country-origin-language-midwest/\">flyover country</a>. Francis urged Buchanan to make another run for the White House in 1996, this time as the candidate of the post-bourgeois resistance. That campaign would be based on three issues: protectionism, opposition to immigration and an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy that repudiated global commitments and foreign interventions in order to focus on defending the national interest.</p> <p>Buchanan listened, and he went on to a surprise win in New Hampshire\u2019s pivotal early primary, convincing Francis that the managerial elite was more vulnerable than at any point in his lifetime. While mainstream Republicans and Democrats celebrated forecasts that the US population was on track to become less than 50% white as a sign of America\u2019s capacity to adapt and grow, Francis believed that the members of his post-bourgeois proletariat regarded these shifting demographics as another reminder of their dwindling power.</p> <p>Buchanan\u2019s campaign fizzled after New Hampshire, but Francis had a ready explanation for the collapse: Buchanan was too loyal to the Republican party to seize the opportunity he had been granted. \u201cDon\u2019t even use the word \u2018conservative,\u2019\u201d Francis told Buchanan. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything any more.\u201d The managerial class had absorbed Buckley and his followers. They, too, were the enemy.</p> <p>After Buchanan\u2019s defeat and his own exile from mainstream conservatism, Francis devoted himself to what he called \u201cracialpolitik\u201d. He was a regular contributor to outlets promoting white racial consciousness \u2013 becoming, in Jared Taylor\u2019s words, \u201cthe intellectual leader of a small but growing movement\u201d. Francis denied that he was a white supremacist, but he condemned interracial sex, warned of \u201cincipient race war\u201d and drafted a manifesto for a white nationalist group arguing: \u201cThe American people and government should remain European in their composition and character.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"088706af3fbf2b6b4d0d62ec41dfa8b18a8d90ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/088706af3fbf2b6b4d0d62ec41dfa8b18a8d90ac/0_74_2039_1223/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pat Buchanan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan at the Cross Roads of the West gun show in Phoenix, Arizona, 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Bourg/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he looked ahead, Francis was especially concerned with the threat that one rising political star posed to his vision of the future. Barack Obama, he remarked in 2004, was \u201cthe model of what the New American is supposed to be\u201d. Ivy League-educated, effortlessly cosmopolitan, promising to transcend barriers of race \u2013 Obama was the embodiment of the managerial elite. He represented everything Francis loathed about the contemporary United States.</p> <p>The fact that Obama, Francis\u2019s symbol for American decadence, became one of the most popular figures in the country brought the great contradiction of his thought into relief. The 19th century belonged to the bourgeoisie and the 20th century to the managers, he argued, because these rising classes had performed necessary social functions. His post-bourgeois proletariat, by contrast, were on the decline.</p> <p>So was Francis. The supposed realist who cast hunger for power as the driving force of world history spent most of his time writing for journals with subscribers in the low five figures. In his last years, he was a lonely man. Before his sudden death from a cardiac aneurism in 2005, he had begun a study of conservatism and race. His masterpiece, Leviathan and Its Enemies, was still tucked away in a box of floppy disks; when it was published 11 years later, it would be under the auspices of a white-nationalist press. The right-leaning Washington Examiner ran one of his few obituaries. \u201cSam Francis,\u201d it said, \u201cwas merely a racist and doesn\u2019t deserve to be remembered as anything less.\u201d It seemed just as likely that Francis would not be remembered at all.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI want you to really listen<strong> </strong>to this,\u201d Rush Limbaugh told his listeners in January this year. The king of rightwing talk radio was lecturing his audience, which averages around 13 million people a week, on Samuel Francis. Prompted by a magazine article casting Francis as the prophet of Trumpism, Limbaugh read aloud from one of Francis\u2019s post-mortems on the Buchanan campaign. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Limbaugh said, \u201cis how right on it is in foretelling Trump.\u201d Before abandoning the subject, he added one point. Francis, Limbaugh noted, \u201clater in life suffered the \u2013 acquired the \u2013 reputation of being a white supremacist\u201d, a reputation Limbaugh insisted was undeserved.</p> <p>The white nationalists who rallied to Francis in the last decade of his life disagree on that point, but they also see Trump as a vindication of their longtime inspiration. \u201cSam would have said that Trump is doing exactly what he advised Patrick Buchanan to do,\u201d maintains Jared Taylor, who made news in the primary season when it was revealed that he had recorded automated phone messages endorsing Trump. (\u201cWhite Supremacist Robocall Heartily Urges Iowa Voters to Support Trump,\u201d reported a headline in the conservative Daily Caller.) According to Taylor\u2019s American Renaissance, \u201cFrancis would be very pleased to see the GOP and conservative establishments mocked and destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>Even liberal commentators are looking back at Francis \u2013 whose prediction of a white working-class backlash against a globalist ruling elite seems to be coming true not just in the US but across Europe. \u201cIf you just drop the white nationalism a lot of Francis makes sense,\u201d says Michael Lind, who once worked as an assistant to Buckley but now describes himself as a \u201cradical centrist\u201d. According to Lind, conservatives have been \u201cspurning their natural constituency \u2013 the mostly white working class\u201d, creating space for the rise of Trump.</p> <p>Francis was also an inspiration for the team at the Journal of American Greatness, who called him \u201cthe closest thing to what could be described as the source of Trumpian thought\u201d in their very first post. They admitted that Francis\u2019s writing \u201covertly indulges various Southern nostalgias\u201d, but insisted that his \u201cdeservedly criticised statements on race\u201d could be separated from the core of his analysis. The managerial class was still the enemy, and only Trump seemed even dimly aware of what it would take to mount an effective challenge.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The authors of JAG looked at the problems facing the US and concluded that Donald Trump might be the answer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the authors at JAG wanted to do more than add chapters to the history Francis had already sketched. While they remain anonymous, sources have identified them as part of a conservative establishment located outside the Washington-New York axis that dominates the intellectual life of the American right \u2013 probably associated with the California-based <a href=\"http://www.claremont.org/\">Claremont Institute</a> and the midwestern <a href=\"https://www.hillsdale.edu/\">Hillsdale College</a>.</p> <p>Trump the candidate, they admitted, was at best an imperfect messenger. But it was the message that counted: \u201cThe American regime \u2013 like nearly all its cousins in the west \u2013 has devolved into an oligarchy.\u201d JAG was not just arguing that Trump\u2019s campaign had a coherent agenda \u2013 a controversial assertion, given that many on both the left and right have dismissed Trump as an unhinged demagogue jabbing randomly at pressure points in the electorate. It was arguing that Trump succeeded <em>because</em> of his platform. Without those ideas, he would have been just another novelty candidate. Armed with them, any of Trump\u2019s more disciplined rivals might have stolen the nomination from him \u2013 but instead they opted for recycled bromides from the Reagan era.</p> <p>The site could be fiery in its defence of Trump, but the best moments came when its targets were the grandees of the right. There are plenty of scathing articles about rightwing thinktanks written from the left, but none of their authors could write a sentence such as \u201cSeeing conservatives court billionaires \u2013 which I have had occasion to do dozens, if not hundreds, of times \u2013 is like watching dorks tell cheerleaders how pretty they are.\u201d</p> <p>For all that, the authors of JAG were still thinkers who looked at the problems facing the US and concluded that Donald Trump might be the answer. They denounced conservatives for accepting \u201cthe leftist lie\u201d that having a \u201cnatural affinity for people who look, think and speak\u201d alike \u201cis shameful and illegitimate\u201d. \u201cThe ceaseless importation of people unaccustomed to liberty,\u201d they wrote \u2013 referring to \u201cmass third world immigration\u201d \u2013 \u201cmakes the American people less fit for liberty every day\u201d. Islam was a subject of particular concern. \u201cWhat good,\u201d they asked, \u201chas Muslim immigration done for the United States and the American people?\u201d Francis would have approved.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>With its archive deleted, JAG\u2019s internet presence is now confined to the occasional mournful tweet from one of its former readers, but the problems it identified on the right are more glaring than ever. \u201cThe conservative movement\u2019s mission has become providing comfortable professional livelihoods to literally hundreds of people,\u201d David Frum told me recently. Although this behemoth has proved effective at turning a profit, the intellectual returns on the investment have been paltry. \u201cConservatism was a lot more creative and effective when it had less money,\u201d Frum said.</p> <p>This narrowing of intellectual ambitions has coincided with a crisis of authority. When asked to name the dominant theme of the right\u2019s intellectual history since George W Bush left office, conservative journalist Michael Brendan Dougherty responded with one word: \u201cdisintegration\u201d. Buckley has been dead for the better part of a decade, and no successor has emerged with the clout to take up his role as arbiter of the true faith.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the little magazines that once set the tempo of debate have struggled to maintain their influence in the age of social media. \u201cTwenty years ago if you got the summer internship at National Review you were high-fiving everyone you knew,\u201d one conservative activist told me. \u201cThat was like getting the Goldman Sachs internship. You were set.\u201d</p> <p>Charles Kesler, a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute and professor at nearby Claremont McKenna College, sees a generational change underway. His best students, he says, used to seek out three paths: some went into academia, others into politics, and a third group tried to navigate a path between the two as writers for middlebrow journals such as National Review. But that middle ground has eroded in the last decade, Kesler says. Now many feel \u201crevulsion\u201d at the state of public debate and take refuge in academia \u2013 or they succumb to a \u201cpopulist tug\u201d and end up at rightwing clickbait factories such as <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/01/how-breitbart-unleashes-hate-mobs-to-threaten-dox-and-troll-trump-critics.html\">Breitbart News</a>. That pull will only grow stronger now that Trump has shown how little influence establishment conservatives have over the constituency they claim to represent.</p> <p>In Washington, a policy-minded cohort dubbed the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/republican-conservative-reformicons-put-new-twist-on-tax-debate-1423010939\">reformicons</a> has become the great hope for conservatives planning their response to the rise of Trump. Long before this year\u2019s campaign, they had begun to devise a more populist agenda to appeal to the working-class voters who have become an increasingly significant part of the Republican electorate. With an eye to the future, they are also convinced that Republicans need to reject Trump\u2019s brand of white identity politics if it hopes to win elections in a country becoming more diverse by the day.</p> <p>From the reformicon perspective, Trump represents a pathological response to the legitimate complaints of voters whose concerns have been overlooked for too long. The challenge for savvy Republican politicians is to convert the impulses that have propelled Trump\u2019s rise into a platform that can appeal to a multiracial coalition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4e54fa933163284de5893fa844788d8525b4f65f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e54fa933163284de5893fa844788d8525b4f65f/0_56_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks at the Republican national convention in Cleveland, Ohio, July 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the well-intentioned reforming wonks have struggled to find an audience outside the capital. Part of the problem is financial. \u201cThere\u2019s no money from rich donors even for reasonable populism,\u201d says Michael Lind. To the ears of conservative billionaires, pleas for economic policies that appeal to workers sound like the prelude to tax hikes on the wealthy. For a Washington-based movement offering what the sceptics at JAG called \u201cmanagerialism with a human face\u201d, a lack of wealthy donors is a potentially fatal obstacle.</p> <p>Of all the forces unleashed by the rise of Trump, the one that may pose the greatest threat to the relevance of the conservative intellectual establishment is the gleefully offensive movement known as the alt-right. Nurtured by online forums such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/reddit\">Reddit</a> and 4chan, along with white-nationalist standbys such as American Renaissance, the alt-right has become a vehicle for the simmering anger of mostly white and mostly young men \u2013 with strong links to the earlier varieties of racialpolitik promoted by Francis, who is sometimes cited as a founder of the alt-right. Mainstream conservatives have reacted with shock and horror to this development. \u201cThe nasty mouth-breathers Buckley expelled from conservatism have returned,\u201d declared a typical response from Commentary, one of the major journals of the establishment right.</p> <p>But the new iconoclasts of the alt-right can\u2019t be purged from a conservative movement they have no desire to join, especially when they can reach an audience of millions on social media. If there is an heir today to the young William F Buckley \u2013 who launched his career with exuberant attacks on the hypocrisy of the liberal establishment and managed to make conservatism look like a stylish rebellion against the powers-that-be \u2013 it might be someone like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/20/milo-yiannopoulos-nero-permanently-banned-twitter\">Milo Yiannopoulos</a>, a professional provocateur who has become a spokesman for the alt-right. At one typical event this spring, Yiannopoulos, who refers to Trump as \u201cDaddy\u201d, delivered a lecture with the title Feminism Is Cancer after being ushered into the auditorium on a throne held aloft by students wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats. Yiannopoulos\u2019s critics are rightly concerned that his main agenda is promoting himself, but Brand Milo is a booming business.</p> <p>The future looks more precarious for the guardians of True Conservatism. They have strong support from leading figures in the Republican party such as Paul Ryan, and retain control over an infrastructure of donors, thinktanks and journals. A landslide defeat for Trump could still revive their cause, but they could just as easily be swept aside by a rising generation of rightwing activists with a more Trumpian set of concerns.</p> <p>Their brand of conservatism won\u2019t disappear, but it could become more a curiosity than a movement, as it was in the days before the birth of the modern right over half a century ago. \u201cThe whole Buckley experiment may have been a passing phase,\u201d says Lind \u2013 a strange interlude when a cohort of writers mistook their ideological preferences for the will of the people and, even stranger, provided the basis for an industry based on that delusion. The anxiety that its time has passed lurks underneath all the conservative establishment\u2019s impassioned denunciations of Trump: a fear that his unprecedented victory in the Republican primary has demonstrated it is already obsolete. \u201cI\u2019m a conservative,\u201d Trump said in April, \u201cbut at this point who cares?\u201d</p> <p>But Trump may have unintentionally pointed the way for a new kind of American conservatism, driven by resentment at the globalist diktats of the hated managerial class. Over the last year, that anger has emerged in surprising venues. In language that Francis would have recognised, the billionaire <a href=\"http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/06/peter-thiel.html\">PayPal co-founder and Silicon Valley guru Peter Thiel</a> declared that America is no longer a democracy \u2013 since it has become a country \u201cdominated by very unelected, technocratic agencies\u201d.</p> <p>Thiel has been an outspoken libertarian since his days as an undergraduate at Stanford in the 1980s, and in 2008 he supplied $500,000 for an attempt to create manmade islands that would provide an \u201cescape from politics in all its forms\u201d, but lately he has started to associate himself with a different crowd. In July, following an outpouring of criticism, <a href=\"https://news.fastcompany.com/peter-thiel-to-speak-atconference-thrown-by-group-tied-to-white-nationalists-4010060\">he cancelled a planned appearance</a> in front of a group that has provided a meeting ground for libertarians and white nationalists, including Francis\u2019s close friend Jared Taylor. But a similar public outcry did not persuade him to drop another speaking engagement earlier that month: a speech on the final night of the Republican national convention, where he had come as a delegate to cast his vote for Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>In episode three of the classic British comedy The Young Ones, there\u2019s a scene where one cop tells another he\u2019s had a \u201cheavy bust up this morning with m\u2019lady\u201d because he insulted the Pope. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit stupid, you know she\u2019s Catholic,\u201d the other says. \u201cYeah, I know she\u2019s Catholic. I didn\u2019t know the Pope was,\u201d comes the reply. The scene then cuts away to a photograph of the pair above a Guardian headline: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55mLS-qWnc\">\u201cPolice IQ Shocker\u201d</a>.</p> <p>But even in an age where real life is becoming impossible to satirise, you couldn\u2019t have made the following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/14/abc-journalist-josh-bavass-detention-at-bunnings-being-examined-by-police\">confrontation from last weekend</a> up. A Queensland cop who identifies himself as senior constable Richard Power approaches a man minding his own business in a car park outside a hardware store. The man, who is suffering from a heavy cold, just happens to be the local police reporter for the ABC, Josh Bavas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/14/abc-journalist-josh-bavass-detention-at-bunnings-being-examined-by-police\">ABC journalist Josh Bavas's detention at Bunnings being examined by police</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMate, the fact that you\u2019ve got pinpoint eyes and <em>you\u2019re looking directly into the sun and they\u2019re not dilating due to the sunlight</em>, I believe you to be under the influence of a dangerous drug,\u201d he says, before detaining him. When Bavas protests, the officer\u2019s colleague replies \u201cOh fucking mate, if we hadn\u2019t have hung onto you mate, you\u2019d float off into fucking outer space.\u201d</p> <p>Bavas records and posts the exchange on Twitter, where it immediately goes viral \u2013 #dickpower trending nationally \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/13/i-have-a-cold-journalist-shocked-after-police-say-he-seems-to-be-on-drugs\">makes headlines</a>. He is soon released without charge and goes back to building a retaining wall at home. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/14/abc-journalist-josh-bavass-detention-at-bunnings-being-examined-by-police\">Queensland Police Service says it is investigating the behaviour of the officers concerned</a>. Bavas then deletes the footage and declines to pursue the matter.</p> <p>That is a matter for him. But there are a number of points to be made here.</p> <p>The first reaction, beyond the \u201cIQ shocker\u201d of an officer who believes pupils should dilate when looking at the sun, is fascination at what happens when the surveillance state is turned upon itself. When the second officer swears, Power reminds him he is being recorded \u2013 not only by Bavas but Power, too, who has a camera planted on his uniform. We hear a grunted apology.</p> <p>The lesson here is a reminder of your legal right to record any untoward interaction you may have with law enforcement. It\u2019s not often we see such naked police hostility, and ineptitude, itself being policed by someone with the presence of mind to record, challenge and disseminate it, let alone by someone who reports on police and court proceedings for a living.</p> <p>The second reaction is more troubling, and has been pointed out by the ABC\u2019s Mark Colvin. It\u2019s not that the wallopers picked on the \u201cwrong guy\u201d \u2013 a white police journalist who knows his rights. How does any member of the force think it\u2019s appropriate to behave in such a contemptuous manner towards any member of the public? </p> <p>To detain Bavas, the police needed a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that Bavas had committed a crime, or was about to. Reasonable suspicions can be difficult to define, but it\u2019s doubtful presuming a man to be \u201cpinned\u201d because his pupils failed to dilate in direct sunlight would impress any magistrate.</p> <p>What has been said of the situation\u2019s broader context only makes it worse. Allegations have been made that the officers\u2019 suspicions were aroused because Bavas was seated close to a group of young Indigenous people. Power apparently asked Bavas if he was with them, before turning his attention to the youths and questioning whether the car they were travelling in was stolen.</p> <p>Two dumb officers, or a wider problem? The popular \u201cbad apples\u201d theory is unlikely to fly with the Indigenous community, for whom such low-level harassment is a disproportionately high reality. Twenty-five years after the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody, the risk of Indigenous Australians being imprisoned remains <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/04/15/national-crisis-indigenous-incarceration-rates-worse-25-years\">13 times higher</a> than for the general population.</p> <p>Of course, that is a national problem, not limited to Queensland. In the wake of the announcement of another royal commission into the abuse of youths at Don Dale Detention Centre in Darwin \u2013 which had been reported on for years before the image of Dylan Voller in a spit hood sparked national revulsion \u2013 there have been <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-27/four-corners-malcolm-turnbull-rules-out-expand-royal-commission/7664108\">many calls for its remit to be widened</a> beyond the Northern Territory\u2019s borders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/can-the-law-come-to-the-rescue-of-abused-asylum-seekers-and-refugees\">Can the law come to the rescue of abused asylum seekers and refugees? | Richard Ackland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The QPS has <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-05/qps-review-finds-no-evidence-of-widespread-negative-culture/7571452\">looked into its own culture</a> in a series of reviews in the last 12 months after widespread allegations of excessive force, bullying and inappropriate behaviour centred on the Gold Coast, unfortunately bucking an overall statewide reduction in complaints. Another review looked at how to de-escalate violent confrontations, following a series of fatal police shootings between 2013 and 2014.</p> <p>What happened to Bavas by contrast was petty, even ridiculous, and made the officers concerned look like fools. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk expressed her concerns and reminded the force of its obligation to treat all members of the public with respect, before acknowledging that officers had a difficult job to do \u2013 sentiments quickly echoed by Bavas.</p> <p>No one doubts policing is a tough gig. But in a culture where \u201ctough on crime\u201d talkback rhetoric rules, civil liberties have been steadily eroded, surveillance is endorsed by both major parties as the price we pay for security, and racial profiling is officially frowned upon but unofficially viewed as cautionary, the security apparatus of the state can only be emboldened.</p> <p>What happened at Don Dale shows where that can end. What happened to Josh Bavas gives the rest of us a glimpse into where it begins.</p>",

At the same time, a friend of mine who arrived in Australia by boat to seek asylum lost contact with his mother who lives in that city.

Thankfully, she survived these attacks, though each day remains full of fear and uncertainty for her safety, compounded by regular reports of fresh attacks on the Hazara.</span></p> <p>When my friend came as an unaccompanied child to apply for protection, government legislation meant that if his claim was approved he could then seek a \u201cfamily reunion\u201d humanitarian visa for his mother.

Without policy change, it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll see his mother again.</p> <p>In 2014, he finished high school, winning awards for community service and vocational education. He\u2019s one of the lucky few people on a bridging visa who is attending university \u2013 paid for by a generous member of the public \u2013 because people on bridging visas or TPVs must pay international student fees to study at university. Without this generosity, his academic and employment potential would be left unexplored and his contribution to our community diminished. He works two part-time jobs and volunteers with Welcome to Australia and other organisations supporting asylum seekers and refugees \u2013 organising community dinners, delivering furniture, speaking in schools and more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/13/we-are-the-forgotten-people-the-anguish-of-australias-invisible-asylum-seekers\">'We are the forgotten people': the anguish of Australia's 'invisible' asylum seekers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under Coalition government policy, the best my friend can hope for is to be granted a temporary protection visa, designed to ensure that those whose claims are successful will never attain Australian citizenship.

Even when they are found to be refugees \u2013 after negotiating an approval process that is intentionally stacked against them \u2013 there is no pathway to gaining the security and sense of belonging that citizenship provides. </p> <p>They face years of uncertainty, struggle and those on TPVs will be forced to re-prove their refugee status every three years, with the potential to having their status overturned and being forced to leave Australia. People who came here as unaccompanied children or single adults are coping with the thought that they might never see their families again thanks to the changes to family reunion policy.</p> <p>The depression and hopelessness in this community are deepening with the return of the Coalition government \u2013 which, in fact, is the intent of a policy designed to encourage people to return to the place of danger or oppression from which they fled.</p> <p>They, of course, talk about their friends and family suffering on Manus Island or Nauru and are desperate for those ugly, abusive facilities to be shut down. They can\u2019t understand how we could continue to ignore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/nauru-files\">report after report </a>of the damage being done to children and adults in our care.</p> <p>Like a growing number of Australians, they\u2019re well aware of the ideological and practical inconsistencies of their place in Coalition policy. Boats carrying people coming to Australia to seek asylum are being intercepted. If, for any reason, those people aren\u2019t returned to their country of departure, they\u2019ll be sent to Nauru or Manus Island with a government guarantee of never settling in Australia.<br></p> <p> The citizenship status of people who have now been living freely in the Australian community for more than three years plays no part in stopping people travelling by boat to seek asylum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/can-the-law-come-to-the-rescue-of-abused-asylum-seekers-and-refugees\">Can the law come to the rescue of abused asylum seekers and refugees? | Richard Ackland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What temporary protection visas do stop is 30,000 Australian residents being able to fully thrive and contribute to our society. TPVs ensure that many of the children now studying in Australian schools will not go to university or reach their academic potential. As we stop these children chasing their dreams, we rob our community of doctors, nurses, designers, teachers, scientists, leaders and artists. With refugees statistically more entrepreneurial than long-term citizens and other migrants, excluding 30,000 people from the security of citizenship means depriving Australia of innovative businesses, jobs and economic growth.</p> <p>Temporary protection visas harm people, damage Australia\u2019s economy and add nothing to the Coalition\u2019s system of \u201cprotecting our border\u201d. Beyond cheap political point-scoring, there\u2019s no reason not to give 30,000 of our most industrious and resilient residents the security they risked their lives to gain.</p> <p>My young friend \u2013 and the thousands like him \u2013 should be freed from the gratuitous cruelty of perpetual limbo and given the opportunity to contribute their potential to the building of the nation they\u2019d love to call home.
