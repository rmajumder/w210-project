  "<p>Theresa May arrived in Downing Street from the Home Office in July with a reputation for being risk averse. The party she leads as prime minister has a wafer-thin working majority in the House of Commons of 17.</p> <p>As the opposition parties point out until they are blue in the face, she is an accidental prime minister with no general election mandate, who washed up at No 10 only as a result of the Brexit tsunami. Just over two months on, however, any suggestion that May would cautiously wield the power suddenly thrust upon her, easing her way in before making her mark, has been dispelled.</p> <p>Her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/michael-gove-sacked-as-theresa-may-appoints-new-cabinet\" title=\"\">ruthless cabinet purge of David Cameron\u2019s inner circle</a> in her first days in charge has been followed by a systematic re-examination of Cameroonian policies.

George Osborne\u2019s deficit-cutting plans have been ditched, signalling more state investment and an end to austerity.</p> <p>The former chancellor\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/north-east-england-devolution-deal-off-the-table-sajid-javid\" title=\"\">northern powerhouse ideas are being subsumed</a> into a wider national regeneration strategy. Bold plans for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/childhood-obesity-strategy-wasted-opportunity-campaigners\" title=\"\">tackling obesity have been watered down</a>. Tory housing policy, so long focused on home ownership, is to be recast with more emphasis on helping those in the rented sector. Most controversially of all, May wants to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/07/senior-tories-likely-to-resist-theresa-mays-grammar-schools-agenda\" title=\"\">expand the number of grammar schools</a>, something opposed by Cameron and that was never on the radar of his reforming former education secretary Michael Gove, cast by May into outer darkness on day one of her premiership.</p> <p>The new prime minister\u2019s approach has, in some respects, seemed to court risk rather than avoid it. Tory MPs loyal to the old order, and those dismissed from government by May, feel bruised and talk carefully but deliberately, in code. \u201cBold to say the least,\u201d said one sacked minister last week, raising his eyebrows and adding that he was \u201cone of a lot of people who she needs to vote with her on things\u201d.</p> <p>On Monday in the Commons, the new education secretary, Justine Greening, gave details <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/14/why-does-theresa-may-want-to-bring-back-grammar-schools-video-explainer\" title=\"\">of the prime minister\u2019s grammar school revolution.</a> \u201cWe do not want to see a return to the old binary system of good schools and bad schools,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery child deserves a place in a great \u2026\u201d The Speaker had to intervene as the opposition benches erupted, asking where her mandate for more grammar schools was. Labour\u2019s Angela Rayner said, to cheers from opposition benches, that the new Tory agenda was one of \u201csegregation, segregation,&#xa0;segregation\u201d.</p> <p>Then Tory doubters spoke out one after another. First to his feet was former Tory education secretary Kenneth Clarke, who asked Greening to make sure that \u201cthis change does not damage the opportunities for pupils in other schools and does not distract priority from raising the standards of all schools for all pupils which has been the objective of this government\u201d.</p> <p>Nicky Morgan, sacked by May as education secretary, voiced her worries, as did the normally restrained Tory chair of the education select committee, Neil Carmichael. \u201cThere is no desire in my constituency for us to have selection,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/15/anna-soubry-sacked-as-theresa-may-carries-out-evening-reshuffle/\" title=\"\">another dismissed minister, Anna Soubry</a>, before former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers weighed in. Labour\u2019s Lucy Powell and Nic Dakin counted the seconds between each Tory member saying how much they welcomed Greening\u2019s desire to widen opportunity and the moment they said \u201cbut\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5f59ba1680a2fc402036e8bae7bfc8b4d13e3390\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f59ba1680a2fc402036e8bae7bfc8b4d13e3390/270_93_2254_1352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron said he was stepping down as an MP to avoid being a \u201cdistraction\u201d.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron said he was stepping down as an MP to avoid being a \u201cdistraction\u201d.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On any other day, Greening\u2019s difficulties would have made big headlines. As it was, David Cameron chose Monday to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/david-cameron-to-stand-down-as-mp-for-witney\" title=\"\">announce that he was standing down as an MP</a>. The former PM insisted that he was not going in a huff because May was trashing his policies but because he did not want to be a \u201cdistraction\u201d. May had \u201cgot off to a cracking start\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Two months into her premiership, Theresa May\u2019s poll ratings remain in honeymoon territory. She is seen by most voters as a reassuring presence and a strong and competent leader, while the ratings for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are dire. She is also seen as slightly less rightwing than Cameron, and her chancellor, Philip Hammond, as a little to the left of his predecessor&#xa0;Osborne.</p> <p>Before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister\" title=\"\">she entered Downing Street for the first time on 13 July, </a>May said her government would not be driven \u201cby the interests of the privileged few\u201d but by those who had had little or none. \u201cWe will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives. When we take the big calls, we\u2019ll think not of the powerful, but you. When we pass new laws we\u2019ll listen not to the mighty, but to you. When it comes to taxes, we\u2019ll prioritise not the wealthy but you.\u201d She was clear, then, that the days of government by the \u201cNotting Hill set\u201d were over. But few expected her to move so fast and so boldly. Her supporters insist that a clear theme to her leadership is already emerging, much of it shaped by her chief of staff, the pro-grammar school Nick Timothy.</p> <p>Unlike the Cameron inner circle, from which May felt excluded, they say she wants not just to show that she cares about \u201cthe bottom 10%, but all those who deserve a chance\u201d. One ally said: \u201cTo her, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/george-osborne-to-chair-northern-powerhouse-partnership\" title=\"\">northern powerhouse looked like a gesture</a>, like it was just about being generous to the north. She wants to prioritise the whole country. If you understand that, you begin to understand her.\u201d</p> <p>Writing on these pages, Phillip Blond, the inventor of one-nation red-Toryism who became disillusioned with Cameron, says May is developing a new post-liberal Conservatism that challenges the idea of so much power and wealth being concentrated in the hands of the elite. For Blond and other \u201ccommunitarian\u201d conservative thinkers, the hope is that the May era will herald an end to laissez-faire economics and usher in an era of proactive government, dedicated to building a more inclusive society. Quite how her approach to grammar schools will help all children, however, is a question being asked by far more Tory MPs than are needed to kill her flagship education plan stone dead in the Commons. The Cameroons are not happy and joke that her biggest achievement in office so far has been to unite Labour over grammar schools in a way it could not have managed itself.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/george-osborne-to-chair-northern-powerhouse-partnership\" title=\"\">Osborne has launched an organisation to reboot the northern powerhouse idea.</a> Last week, at an event hosted by the pollsters Opinium and the Social Market Foundation, Nicky Morgan suggested May would lack the appeal to centre-ground voters that Cameron had.</p> <p>With Brexit to deal with, a majority of 17 and no direct mandate of her own, Theresa May may soon realise the downside of taking risks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"db1cfa10b4d3c7c34bd80b2c7680e525d155ddd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db1cfa10b4d3c7c34bd80b2c7680e525d155ddd7/0_73_4456_2673/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Osborne\u2019s plan to abolish the deficit was among the first Cameron policy to be jettisoned.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Osborne\u2019s plan to abolish the deficit was among the first Cameron policy to be jettisoned.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>CAMERON REFORMS BEING REVERSED</strong></h2> <p><strong>THE DEFICIT </strong></p> <p>The Tory election manifesto in May 2015 was clear: \u201cThe way to keep our economy secure for the future is to eliminate the deficit entirely and start running a surplus. Anything less would be to ignore the lessons of the past.\u201d Then came Brexit, out went David Cameron and George Osborne and all that changed. Even before becoming leader, Theresa May said she would no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by 2020, abandoning Osborne\u2019s pledge to more than balance the books by the next election. In July, his successor as chancellor, Phillip Hammond, went further, saying his first autumn statement would be a chance to \u201creset fiscal policy\u201d. The statement is expected to mark an end to austerity \u2013 with which Osborne will always be associated \u2013 and usher in an era of more state investment to boost the economy, improve infrastructure and create jobs.</p> <p><strong>NORTHERN POWERHOUSE </strong></p> <p>On Friday, Osborne said May\u2019s government had had \u201ca wobble\u201d on his plans for a northern powerhouse. But he claimed through gritted teeth that it was now \u201c100% committed\u201d. However, that overstated the reality. May made it clear on entering No 10 that she wanted a broader, nationwide industrial strategy rather than merely a \u201cnorthern\u201d one \u2013 an approach that covered the whole country. Initially, she even seemed reluctant to use the term \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, reflecting her clear reservations and suggesting that she thought it was a something of a stunt. To keep the flame of the policy, which he launched in 2014, very much alive Osborne announced on Friday that he would chair a new organisation to advance the plans, including greater devolution of powers.</p> <p><strong>OBESITY </strong></p> <p>May\u2019s government has come under fire from the BMA, the Tory chair of the health select committee, Dr Sarah Wollaston, and celebrity chef, Jamie Oliver, for watering down plans for an ambitious anti-obesity strategy. Professor Parveen Kumar, chair of the BMA\u2019s board of science, said the government had \u201crowed back on its promises by announcing what looks like a weak plan, rather than the robust strategy it promised\u201d. Given concerns that NHS bills are soaring as a result of obesity, the government left itself open to attack. It said food companies would not be compelled to reduce levels of sugar in products but would be subject to voluntary targets. Kumar said this approach would be \u201cpointless\u201d. Wollaston said the plans showed \u201cthe hand of big industry lobbyists\u201d. Ministers said the plans, including a voluntary target to cut sugar in children\u2019s food and drink, were bold and announced new measures to try to expand sporting provision in primary schools.</p> <p><strong>GRAMMAR SCHOOLS </strong></p> <p>David Cameron said in 2006 that he did not want a return to selection. \u201cThe prospect of bringing back grammar schools has always been wrong and I\u2019ve never supported it. And I don\u2019t think any Conservative government would have done it.\u201d Instead, his administration sought to raise standards across the state sector by increasing school autonomy through the expansion of academies and Michael Gove\u2019s free schools project. May changed tack unexpectedly, prompting a huge row and raising concerns among many of her MPs. \u201cFor too long, we have tolerated a system that contains an arbitrary rule preventing selective schools from being established \u2013 sacrificing children\u2019s potential because of dogma and ideology,\u201d she said. \u201cThe truth is that we already have selection in our school system \u2013 and it\u2019s selection by house price, selection by wealth. That is simply unfair.\u201d</p> <p><strong>HOUSING</strong></p> <p>May\u2019s housing minister, Gavin Barwell, hinted strongly in a speech that the government would shift its focus from home ownership to helping those in the rented sector. \u201cWe need to build more homes of every single type and not focus on one single tenure,\u201d he said in terms that were seen in the housing industry as softening it up for a change of direction. Barwell appeared to recognise that many of those most in need are renters, who desire more security and protection. He also suggested that the government could ditch plans to build 200,000 \u201cstarter homes\u201d by 2020 \u2013 a plan that has been widely criticised on the grounds that such homes, although supposedly for those on low incomes, would turn out to be unaffordable for the less well off.</p> <p><strong>PRISON REFORMS </strong></p> <p>The new justice secretary, Liz Truss, threw Gove\u2019s plans for sweeping reforms of prisons in England and Wales into huge doubt within weeks of entering office. Under Gove\u2019s plans, prisons would have gained more control over budgets and how they were run. Truss said she was \u201cnot committing\u201d to such legislation. The Ministry of Justice insisted it was still \u201ctotally committed\u201d to prison reform although what emerges is likely to be Truss\u2019s blueprint. She told the Commons justice committee that she wanted to speed up the pace of change, including giving governors greater autonomy, as Gove suggested, but was looking at the \u201coverall system\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"94632e3beb4b44744444a140863c6d98bf8d974f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94632e3beb4b44744444a140863c6d98bf8d974f/1190_237_1166_1456/801.jpg\" alt=\"Phillip Blond\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phillip Blond</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephane Grangier - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>WHAT THE ANALYSTS SAY</h2> <p><strong>PHILLIP BLOND, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRE-RIGHT RESPUBLICA</strong> <strong>THINKTANK</strong></p> <p>To chart the direction of the Conservative party under Theresa May, one need only point out the differences between her and David Cameron.</p> <p>Cameron unfortunately (and despite the early PR) turned out to be quite conventional. He was both an economic liberal and a social liberal, whereas I suspect May is neither. This does not make her a reactionary, but potentially somebody who can be revolutionary and can create a transformative and good post-liberal politics.</p> <p>Across the west, the failure of the liberal elite (both left and right) to recognise the damage liberalism has wrought has provoked all manner of reactionary politics, from Trump in the US to Le Pen in France. Yet we have failed to identify the cause \u2013 ever more extreme liberalism. On liberalism\u2019s watch, we have seen a massive concentration of wealth and power; whereas socially, we have witnessed the dismissal and humiliation of working-class people, coupled with the mindless endorsement of mass migration, as if we could replace the servile class with those more compliant. Unless we develop a non-regressive form of politics, the future promises to be more primitive and inhabited by racists, nationalists and perhaps fascists, because the conventional centre is empty, outmoded and has nothing to offer.</p> <p>That is why I have great hopes for May \u2013 she has the right targets and doesn\u2019t believe in old solutions. From recognising that infrastructure such as Hinkley Point shouldn\u2019t just go to the highest bidder but that government should retain a veto, to the idea that the poor, like the middle class, should have access to excellent schools.</p> <p>Expect more of the same, from mutualising infrastructure such as railways, to creating assets and savings for working people. I can also imagine her remodelling migration on the basis of shared values and integration, so as to draw its poison and keep Britain open to the world. In short, May is post-liberal, and that could be the most progressive politics we have had in decades.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0ecd063c0ab6b1dafced8153c94db0ec31d61696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ecd063c0ab6b1dafced8153c94db0ec31d61696/445_1146_1137_1420/801.jpg\" alt=\"David Green\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Green</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>DAVID GREEN, DIRECTOR OF THE CIVITAS THINKTANK</strong></p> <p>Is Mayism different? Thatcherism was dominated by the view that freedom was the absence of government, which implied reducing the scope of the state by deregulating and privatising.</p> <p>For Mayism, freedom is a political achievement. If everyone is to have a share in prosperity, then it requires active government, not least in the form of a \u201cproper industrial strategy\u201d.</p> <p>Cameronism was more about image building than problem solving. Putting forward policy ideas under him might have got the reaction: \u201cThat\u2019s a good line, I can use that in a speech.\u201d Not so now. Mayism is different because it recognises that globalisation has not delivered for everyone. During the EU debate, Tories such as Boris Johnson criticised globalisation as manifested in the \u201cfour freedoms\u201d of the EU. They have little to do with personal freedom. Rather, they are the doctrines of laissez-faire economics, which lumps together four different things. Goods and services are produced with buying and selling in mind; but labour and money are not primarily commodities.</p> <p>Gordon Brown used to argue that the free movement of labour was counter-inflationary, which could only be the result of lowering wages. Now Theresa May defines the lowering of wages as a problem. Too much immigration makes it harder for people to make ends meet and achieve their personal best.</p> <p>The unexpected commitment to grammar schools comes from the same philosophical root. To be free is to be able to develop your talents to the full, but active government is needed to give everyone a fighting chance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"71a4b1302777f54af4050e56edd37e3c21ffbe93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71a4b1302777f54af4050e56edd37e3c21ffbe93/1969_524_2653_3316/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ayesha Hazarika\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ayesha Hazarika</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: sent by her</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>AYESHA HAZARIKA, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND FORMER ADVISER TO HARRIET HARMAN AND ED MILIBAND</strong></p> <p>Theresa May is no novice. She may have arrived at the top job by accident, but she has had a ringside seat at the top of politics for more than a decade.</p> <p>Although everyone, including George Osborne, is up in arms about the return of grammars and, let\u2019s be honest, secondary moderns \u2013 there is some method in her madness.</p> <p>She is normally an evidence-based cautious politician, yet has jumped headlong into this row with verve and enthusiasm. Why? The obvious reason is because she is trying to put clear water between her and Cameron. But there is more to it than that.She will know how critical the first big moments are for a new prime minister. Your first words on the steps of Downing Street. Your first PMQs. Your first hires and fires. And critically, your first fight.</p> <p>She knows the grammar school row will not be easy. Many on her own side hate it. The Lords will make serious trouble and it even unites the Labour party. But she knows that grassroots supporters and wavering Ukip voters, who may come back to the Tories, will see a fight for something which feels true blue, nostalgic, populist and bold.</p> <p>But she should beware. As her predecessor discovered, what starts as scratching an ideological itch can end up being a fatal political wound.</p>",
  "<p>Kristian Jensen, Denmark\u2019s foreign minister, gave a precise response last week to a request by Russia for the nations to enter bilateral talks over the ownership of the north pole. He flatly rejected the move. \u201cWe need to apply the international rules,\u201d he told reporters.</p> <p>The Russian request and the swift Danish response are intriguing. The United Nations is currently assessing Russian, Danish and Canadian claims to own sizeable chunks of the Arctic seabed. The Russian move was generally viewed as an attempt to strike a deal that would cut out Canada, while Denmark appears to believe its case is strong enough to exclude such manoeuvres.</p> <p>One thing is clear. The Arctic is heating up in meteorological, political and environmental terms as nations fall over themselves to exploit the region.</p> <p>Apart from Denmark\u2019s rebuff of Russia\u2019s Arctic overtures, Canadian explorers announced last week they had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/hms-terror-wreck-found-arctic-nearly-170-years-northwest-passage-attempt\">discovered the wreck of HMS Terror</a>, one of the two ships belonging to British explorer Sir John Franklin\u2019s doomed attempt to sail the Northwest Passage between the Atlantic and the Pacific. (The other expedition ship, Erebus, was discovered two years ago.) These two vessels have enormous symbolic importance because Canada believes they support its claim to own the passage, which other nations, such as the US, argue is international waters.</p> <p>Then there were the recent moves by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/hms-terror-wreck-found-arctic-nearly-170-years-northwest-passage-attempt\">China to invest in mines in Greenland</a>, where declining ice cover is exposing vast outcrops of ores, including minerals crucial to mobile phone manufacture. Similarly, drilling companies are eyeing seabed reserves of natural gas and oil while travel companies are preparing to send huge cruise liners into the region. The first of these trips, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/13/large-cruise-ship-voyage-arctic-ice-crystal-cruises\">the Crystal Serenity</a>, has just been completed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d3c92cb2429dc488e8259f0e54bc6f5187514a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d3c92cb2429dc488e8259f0e54bc6f5187514a3/118_291_3482_2090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Prirazlomnaya offshore ice-resistant oil-producing platform.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Prirazlomnaya offshore ice-resistant oil-producing platform.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Enormous forces, political and commercial, are bearing down on the region although all have a common root \u2013 as was also highlighted last week. Summer sea ice, which once covered 7.5 million sq km around the north pole, this year dropped to 4.13m sq km, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/16/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-to-second-lowest-level-ever-recorded\">its second lowest figure on record, it was announced.</a> The rate of annual change \u2013 brought about by soaring fossil fuel emissions and rises in global temperatures \u2013 is now equivalent to a loss greater than the size of Scotland.</p> <p>\u201cLoss of sea ice has local to global effects, from animals and ecosystems to encouraging further warming by exposing ocean water,\u201d said Twila Moon, at Bristol University. \u201cWe should all be shocked by the dramatic changes happening in the Arctic.\u201d</p> <p>Most scientists now expect that, at current emission rates, the Arctic will be reliably free of sea ice in the summer by the middle of the century. By \u201cfree\u201d they mean there will be less than 1m sq km of sea ice left in the Arctic, most of it packed into remote bays and channels while the central Arctic Ocean over the north pole will be completely open. And by \u201creliably\u201d, scientists mean there will have been five consecutive years with less than 1m sq km of ice by the year 2050. The first single ice-free year will come much earlier than this, however.</p> <p>\u201cThe Arctic is opening up, and all sorts of flashpoints lie ahead,\u201d said Klaus Dodds, professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of London. \u201cIf the central Arctic Ocean is freed of ice for several months a year, who will control the fishing and the dumping of waste there? The Russians have also made it clear they want to drill for oil and gas.\u201d</p> <p>This point was also stressed by Professor Chris Rapley, of University College London. \u201cAn increasingly ice-free Arctic is a geopolitical game changer,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Already there are profound changes, with invasive species pouring into the warming Arctic and threatening existing populations, according to Melanie Lancaster of WWF\u2019s Arctic programme. \u201cSpecialised Arctic species such as polar bears [are already] showing signs of stress. Conservation action is urgently needed.\u201d</p> <p>However, the Arctic, its wildlife and its four million inhabitants face a major handicap: the region\u2019s lack of centralised protection and control. The Antarctic Treaty bans all mining, oil drilling or the presence of the military and strictly monitors all environmental hazards around the south pole. By contrast, although no nation owns the north pole, the Arctic nations \u2013 Russia, Canada, the United States, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and Denmark \u2013 have very different ideas about how to run the world\u2019s most northerly regions.</p> <p>\u201cArctic environmental protection is currently determined by individual nations, by politicians who often meet far from its borders: in Moscow, Copenhagen and Washington,\u201d said Professor Michael Byers of the University of British Columbia. \u201cThey have very different levels of commitment to protecting the environment \u2013 with Russia at the bottom and the Nordic nations at the top.\u201d</p> <p>And it is not just the Arctic nations who are eyeing up the riches around the north pole. China recently assigned itself the status of being \u201ca near-Arctic state\u201d. It views the opening Arctic seas as an opportunity to maintain its access to the world\u2019s most important resources. Some of the Earth\u2019s major stocks of fish are migrating north as the planet heats up while the Arctic\u2019s mineral resources are being exposed by retreating ice.</p> <p>\u201cThe Chinese have made no secret that they have their eyes on the Arctic\u2019s fish and minerals,\u201d said Dodds.</p> <p>This raises the question of what the Inuit and other Arctic people think about resources being exploited by others. \u201cThey are not against resource development but they do like to be consulted and involved,\u201d said Dodds. \u201cThey do not want to be cheated. However, there are often disagreements within communities about the choices they have to make. Will a mining development ruin a village\u2019s tourist potential, for example?\u201d</p> <p>Byers was cautious. \u201cI have enormous sympathy for the local peoples in the Arctic but they are few in number and have limited resources.

In 2013, Greenpeace activists attempted to scale the Prirazlomnaya drilling platform as part of a protest against Arctic oil production. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/19/greenpeace-protesters-arrested-arctic\">Russians arrested them at gunpoint</a> and charged the activists initially with piracy and later with hooliganism and only released them after two months of detention. \u201cThat is an indication of how seriously they take the Arctic,\u201d added Depledge.</p> <p>This point was backed by Dodds: \u201cThe Russians are hell bent on showing the world they mean business here.\u201d</p> <p>Could that determination lead to an outbreak of hostilities? Byers was not convinced. \u201cThe Arctic is a very expensive region in which to operate and Russia is not a wealthy country. The cost of militarising the Arctic would be prohibitive. They might want to police it so that they can control outfits like Greenpeace but I don\u2019t see them having a war with another Arctic nation.\u201d</p> <p>The implications for the region are still worrying, nevertheless. As Rapley stated: \u201cThe ongoing thinning [of Arctic summer sea ice] is especially significant and the implications are profound. The Arctic nations are jostling for advantage, and the economic and ecological consequences of new trade routes opening up have yet to unfold. The changes that have occurred have been greater and faster than predicted. The planet is sending a clear message: time is running out.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>If Tony Blair and David Cameron ever bump into each other, they can compare notes on the thanklessness of political parties. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the words \u201cungrateful bastards\u201d passed their lips. Mr Blair won his lot three consecutive elections, a feat never before achieved by Labour and a record that does not look likely to be repeated. Yet denouncing him is today the most reliable way to rouse a cheer from many leftwing audiences. Mr Cameron took the Tories back to power after a 13-year absence from office and then, at the last election, increased their seats and share of vote. Yet his successor in No 10 thinks her quickest route to popularity is to dump on him. I can see why he has decided not to hang around in parliament to be a spectator while Mrs May buries him alive.</p> <p>The experience of these two ex-leaders tells the story of the rise and fall of a political era. Call it, if you like, the Age of Centrism. Or, if you prefer, the Liberal Ascendancy. It began in 1990 when John Major replaced Margaret Thatcher on a mission to revive the Tories\u2019 popularity by softening her harsher ideological edges. Liberal centrism peaked under Tony Blair, endured through Gordon Brown and had a further lease of life during the coalition when Nick Clegg, and others who actually called themselves Liberal, joined the government. Many of its adherents think its last rites were read when Britain voted for Brexit.</p> <p>I am, I know, painting with an extremely broad brush. There were serious differences between these men and their governments, but on the big issues there was common ground. All of them presided over a mixed economy of state and private provision of goods and services. All were committed to free trade; all were permissive on social issues. All subscribed to membership of the European Union. John Major and Tony Blair had a lot more in common with each other than either did with Nigel Farage or Jeremy Corbyn. Ditto Gordon Brown and David Cameron. New Labour accepted much of the Thatcherite economic settlement inherited from the Conservatives, which is precisely what was wrong with it for opponents from the left. Cameroonians embraced the social liberalism of the Blair era, much to the discontent of many on the traditional right.</p> <p>Is centrism now discredited and defeated? To many observers, it looks that way. A recent collaboration between the Social Market Foundation and the pollsters Opinium is entitled <a href=\"(http://opinium.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Dead-Centre-British-politics4_lr.pdf)\" title=\"\">\u201cDead Centre\u201d</a> and remarks \u201cafter a long referendum campaign focused on sovereignty and immigration, the Leave vote, the demise of Cameron\u2019s political project, the failure of the Liberal Democrats to mount much of a comeback and the resilience of Corbynism and Scottish nationalism, the centre looks barren\u201d.</p> <p>Whatever anyone thinks of Jeremy Corbyn, no one would ever call him centrist. On Saturday, he will be re-elected as Labour leader. His team radiate confidence that he will win and win well. Supporters of his challenger, Owen Smith, sound resigned to defeat. That result will not be reflective of the wishes of Labour MPs who triggered the challenge when 172 of them declared they had no confidence in his leadership. Nor will it be a result that pays heed to the party\u2019s dire poll ratings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/corbyn-makes-conditional-peace-offer-to-hostile-labour-mps\">Jeremy Corbyn makes conditional peace offer to hostile Labour MPs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What it will show is how the Labour party has been transformed. There are all sorts of complicated reasons why Mr Corbyn will win. Then there is the straightforward explanation: the Labour electorate has become a lot more leftwing. Its membership began to shift left under Ed Miliband, moved further that way after the 2015 defeat and this process has <a href=\"http://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/items/178403.html\" title=\"\">accelerated over the past 12 months</a>. There is evidence that Mr Smith has done well among people who were party members before 2015, but the gains he has made among that group have been matched \u2013 more than matched, most likely \u2013 by the support for Mr Corbyn from those who joined the party since he became leader. The chasm between a broadly centrist parliamentary party and a much more leftwing membership has grown even wider.</p> <p>Over on the Conservative side of the ledger, people are still trying to get a precise ideological fix on Mrs May. She has revived the cabinet career of Liam Fox, a hardline Brexiter, but she has also promoted One Nation Tories such as Damian Green and David Lidington. She has made noises about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/11/theresa-mays-plans-curb-boardroom-excess-receive-mixed-reaction\" title=\"\">corporate governance</a> which sound leftwing coming from a Tory prime minister while indicating right in other policy areas. The ingredient that is bound to be the strongest flavour in the character of her government is withdrawal from the EU, bringing to fruition the dream of the Tory right.</p> <p>Between a Brexiteering Conservative government and Corbynista Labour, there are acres of unoccupied political real estate. This looks like an opportunity for the Lib Dems, who have historically prospered when the two major parties have moved off the centre. The Lib Dems have begun their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/17/farron-invites-labour-and-tory-members-to-join-lib-dems\" title=\"\">conference</a> in Brighton by boasting that they\u2019ve been putting on members, but their poll rating is stuck at a level no better than their vote share at the last election. Memories of the coalition are too fresh for them to revive their pre-2010 role as a vehicle for protest. Their leader, Tim Farron, occasionally casts come-hither glances at Labour MPs, but they don\u2019t see the Lib Dems as a place of refuge. Mr Farron and his small parliamentary band are struggling to make themselves heard. \u201cYou can only do so much with eight MPs,\u201d laments one of them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Centrists blithely assumed their internationalist, tolerant instincts were so obviously correct, they had to prevail</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Their former leader, Nick Clegg, gamely speculates that politics has become so volatile and Brexit will be such a horrendous mess that the Lib Dems could be back in office sooner than anyone thinks as part of a \u201cGovernment of National Unity\u201d. His optimism is endearing but not widely shared. Most think that the road back for the Lib Dems will be the slow and hard one of gradually rebuilding their base in local government while hoping for a parliamentary byelection sensation here or there. One senior figure in the party describes it as \u201cthe work of a generation\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/paddy-ashdown-i-turned-to-my-wife-and-said-its-not-our-country-any-more\" title=\"\">Paddy Ashdown</a> has concluded that the party he used to lead isn\u2019t capable of resurrecting liberal centrism by itself. So he has founded a campaign group called More United which hopes to recruit support from across parties.</p> <p>Before there can be a revival, advocates of liberal centrism first have to work out why and where it went wrong. One way of thinking is that it was undone by the mistakes of individuals. Tony Blair\u2019s reputation never recovered from the Iraq war. David Cameron blundered into Brexit. Nick Clegg failed to tell a persuasive story about the coalition government and his role in it.</p> <p>A less comfortable explanation for liberal centrists is that there were some fundamental flaws in their creed and how they applied it in power. They won elections by promising to be best at delivering prosperity combined with social justice, a formula which broke down when economic times got rough and nasty choices had to be made.</p> <p>Liberal centrists have been guilty of hubris. One of their shared assumptions was that free trade was always a good thing, which meant that globalisation would be wonderful for everyone and, even if it wasn\u2019t, it was too powerful to be resisted. Tony Blair didn\u2019t forsee the blowback against a permissive immigration policy and nor did his counterparts across the EU. David Cameron tried to exploit discontent about immigration but only made it worse by making promises to curb labour flows that he couldn\u2019t keep.</p> <p>They blithely assumed that their cosmopolitan, internationalist, tolerant instincts were so obviously correct, so patently rational, that they had to prevail. They couldn\u2019t believe Britain would vote to leave the EU \u2013 and are still struggling to come to terms with a referendum result that rejected their entire world view. They largely became defenders of the status quo \u2013 and that status quo was widely held to favour elites \u2013 in a period of rising rage against anything that could be construed as the \u201cestablishment\u201d. That created a fertile climate for insurgents preaching left, right and nationalist populisms. The centrists were slow to spot and respond to the rise of identity politics, whether it came in the guise of Ukip or the form of the Scottish nationalists. These insurgent forces sounded authentic and passionate where centrists too often came over as bloodless and manageralist. It may be of some consolation, but that is all it is, that this has happened to the traditional governing parties of the centre-right and centre-left across the developed democracies.</p> <p>Centrist leaders were adept at winning elections in their era of dominance but never so good at enthusing supporters who chafed at the compromises involved. One of the things Mr Corbyn indisputably represents is a backlash against Blairism. Mrs May is probably right to calculate that her party never felt all that warm towards Mr Cameron.</p> <p>And yet. Liberal centrism prospered because it was attractive to a critical mass of voters. They liked governments that sounded moderate, acted pragmatically and weren\u2019t too heavy with ideology. Many voters still want that. When <a href=\"http://opinium.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Dead-Centre-British-politics4_lr.pdf\" title=\"\">asked to place themselves on the political spectrum, nearly half of the electorate still self-identifies with the centre</a>.</p> <p>The centre is not dead. It is dazed and confused. It needs fresh ideas and more engaging ways of expressing itself. It will get its voice back one day.</p>",
  "<p>The sea ice covering the most northerly part of our planet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/16/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-to-second-lowest-level-ever-recorded\" title=\"\">shrank last week</a> to its second lowest level on record. Once stable at around 7.5m sq km in summer, the Arctic ice cap has been dwindling for several decades and dropped to an area of 4.1m sq km a few days ago, a victim of the rising fossil-fuel emissions and increasing temperatures that now beset the Earth. At the same time, the US space agency Nasa announced that August 2016 had tied with July 2016 as the <a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2016-09-august-equals-july-hottest-month.html\" title=\"\">hottest month globally ever recorded</a>. Our world is heating up dramatically.</p> <p>As winter returns to the far north, its ice cover will slowly return, of course, though it will certainly not be restored to its former glory. The overall trend of summer Arctic sea-ice cover has been a steadily downwards one for the past 30 years, an inexorable decline that has deeply worrying implications for the region, and for the rest of the planet, as we report today. An Arctic that is regularly free of sea ice in summer \u2013 a real prospect for the middle of the century \u2013 will open up that fragile, pristine wilderness to all sorts of potential woes: overfishing; pollution related to oil drilling and mineral extraction; the eradication of indigenous species; and the destruction of native communities. In addition, with little or no ice left to reflect solar radiation back into space, and its dark waters absorbing more and more of that radiation, the Arctic will heat up even further, enhancing the global warming that has already taken a grip on the planet. As Professor Gail Whiteman, of Lancaster University, <a href=\"http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/news/forget-the-ftse-500-the-arctic-is-the-real-barometer-of-global-risk/\" title=\"\">remarked last week</a>: \u201cForget the FTSE: Arctic sea ice is the real barometer of global risk.\u201d</p> <p>Urgent action is clearly needed, a point that is not lost on international climate negotiators. In a few weeks, they are scheduled to <a href=\"http://www.cop22.ma/en\" title=\"\">assemble in Marrakech</a> in order to discuss the ratification of the Paris agreement, which was hammered out late last year and which seeks to limit the burning of fossil fuels in order to restrict carbon dioxide emissions and so limit global temperature rises to around 2C since pre-industrial times. To date, a total of 27 nations \u2013 including Brazil, China and the United States \u2013 have formally backed the plan, and a further 20 countries are expected to add their names in the next few days. Crucially, the United Kingdom has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37272671\" title=\"\">made no commitment to back the Paris accord</a>. Yet the agreement needs the formal support of 55 nations before it can come into force.</p> <p>The fact that the Britain still refuses to put its name to the treaty is therefore deeply worrying. The government claims that it is committed, ultimately, to backing the agreement but the longer it delays, the more it is likely to lose the leadership it once commanded when it came to climate change issues. Even if Britain misses the legislative deadline set for the Marrakech meeting, an announcement now that it is committed to the Paris agreement would send a much-needed message to the world. It would let them know that the current UK government still realises the urgency of the situation and the perils that face the planet.</p> <p>The problem is not one that should be viewed as being vague and global, however. It is a precise danger and it is a local one as well. As the planet heats up, so the United Kingdom is also becoming warmer and wetter. Our eight warmest years on record have occurred from 2000 onwards, and during that time we have also experienced six of our seven wettest years. The atmosphere, as it heats up, is holding on to more and more water which it then releases as bursts of intense rainfall. This point was emphasised by the <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/news/2016/national-flood-resilience-review\" title=\"\">National Flood Resilience Review</a>, published earlier this month, which admitted that we are now facing a greater threat of flooding due to heaver rainfall and rising sea levels than ever before. Monthly rainfall totals in winter could be up to 30% higher than recent past extremes, it stated.</p> <p>Last December\u2019s record flooding \u2013 which saw 341mm of rain fall in 24 hours at Honister Pass in the Lake District, for example \u2013 is certainly likely to be surpassed in the next few years. Yet the government is so far committed to making only the most rudimentary of infrastructure improvements in order to combat the problem, and has pledged a mere \u00a312m of extra cash for anti-flooding measures. That level of response is simply insufficient.</p> <p>There is a real need now for the government to assure the public that it understands the risks we face from climate change and commit itself fully to this urgent and pressing issue.</p> <h2>CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>",
  "<p>Shortly before the fateful referendum, Lord Carrington, the Tory party\u2019s most distinguished elder statesman, was at a Sunday lunch in the country, listening patiently to the younger element discussing the merits or otherwise of one Alexander (Boris) Johnson. When they eventually paused for breath, the great man spoke, and brought the conversation to a halt with the simple remark: \u201cAnyway, he won\u2019t do.\u201d</p> <p>I recalled this episode last week when Ken Clarke, one of my favourite Tories of the generation after Carrington, and now in turn very much an elder statesman in his own right, was reported as saying something that could be paraphrased as \u201canyway, the referendum won\u2019t do\u201d.</p> <p>What Ken apparently wrote in an email to a constituent was that most politicians \u201cpaid lip-service to the supposedly democratic nature of the [referendum] exercise\u201d, but he would do his best \u201cto contribute to mitigating the disaster that this decision on 23&#xa0;June might otherwise cause\u201d.</p> <p>He said he would probably vote against any move to trigger, via the infamous article 50, the Brexit process, and noted the shambles the government has already got itself into over trying to square the circle of remaining in the single market and customs union while satisfying the anti-immigration lobby.</p> <p>Which brings us to an interesting revelation by Nick Clegg, who has just published his version of the coalition years that wrecked the Lib Dem vote in last year\u2019s general election. Here we are, with the biggest housing crisis since the second world war, and Clegg tells us that either David Cameron or George Osborne (he can\u2019t remember which, but that hardly matters since, to coin a phrase, they were \u201call in it together\u201d) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/03/nick-clegg-did-not-cater-tories-brazen-ruthlessness\" title=\"\">told him</a>: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you keep going on about the need for more social housing: it just creates Labour voters.\u201d</p> <p>Clegg found Osborne\u2019s behaviour \u201cvery unattractive, very cynical&#xa0;\u2026 Welfare for Osborne was just a bottomless pit of savings, and it didn\u2019t really matter what the human consequences were.\u201d</p> <p>This, from a recent interview in the <em>Guardian</em>, provides chapter and verse for the conclusion that my fellow critics and I came to about Osborne right from the start of his nasty austerity programme. Not only was the attack on the poor disgraceful, and out of keeping with the kind of Conservatism believed in by Tories such as the late Ian Gilmour (who was meant to be one of David Cameron\u2019s heroes), but it must have contributed to the revolt against London and the establishment that was one of the factors behind the Brexit vote.</p> <p>In which context, the Oxford economist Andrew Graham \u2013 son of Winston Graham of <em>Poldark</em> fame \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/17/uk-in-control-post-brexit-fantasy-eu-trade-only-remaining-clout\" title=\"\">wrote in the course of the referendum campaign</a>: \u201cOne of the more unedifying aspects of this campaign is observing Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, both members of a government that has been imposing cuts in public services, having the gall to blame [the pressure on public services] on immigration.\u201d</p> <p>Now, for the moment Theresa May has ruled out not only a second referendum but even a parliamentary vote on article 50. But Tim Farron, the leader of the Lib Dems, made the point last week that, as the public wakes up to the realisation that leaving the EU is a \u201ccalamitous situation that our children will pay for\u201d, the prevailing belief that a second referendum is out of the question may be challenged.</p> <p>I would add to Farron\u2019s observation: yes, \u201cthe people have spoken\u201d, but human nature is fickle, especially when faced with dawning reality, and the people may want to speak again. Indeed some of the people are already upset at reports that they may have to pay for visas to go to the continent.</p> <p>One of the more bizarre aspects of this rotten business is the title that has been bestowed upon my old friend and champion of civil liberties, David Davis. Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. Pure <em>Yes, Minister.</em> You could not make it up.</p> <p>Many people seem to have forgotten that Davis could well have become leader of the Conservative party until he was upstaged by David Cameron, who is now reduced to saying that at least one promise he kept was the one to hold a referendum \u2013 in truth, the one promise he should never have kept.</p> <p>Davis backed what turned out to be Theresa May\u2019s ultra-short-lived campaign, although he had often disagreed with her in the past. There is a mutual respect there, but it is already being sorely tested by May\u2019s understandable desperation to maintain as many trading advantages as possible, while Davis is quite cavalier about the single market.</p> <p>He believes that the completion of the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations in the 1990s was more important for the British economy than joining the single market (which latter move Mrs Thatcher, no less, initiated).</p> <p>One can agree to disagree on this, but what is especially absurd about Brexit is that the kind of regulations and tariff barriers that are in prospect for British business would make current complaints about \u201cBrussels\u201d look like a vicarage tea party.</p> <p>Yes, sorry: I refuse to accept the prevailing view that we must accept the results of the referendum and \u201cmove on\u201d. Bully for Ken Clarke and Tim Farron: I am right with them, and I hope many others will join us.</p>",
  "<p>It might appear the contrast between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/black-lives-matter-protesters-occupy-london-city-airport-runway\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matters</a> protesters who closed London City airport runway, and the junior doctors leading their colleagues into 15 days of strike action, could not be starker. The former are a small band of radical environmentalists, drawn from the nation\u2019s organic farms and houseboats, zipping across the Thames to save the world\u2019s black people from climate change. The latter are a group of professionals who work long hours in the service of the NHS, galvanised into striking by the imposition of a contract that they see as unfair.</p> <p>But, barely visible beneath the noisy anger , runs a common thread. Both claim to represent the interests of large groups of people, endowing their action with a moral legitimacy it wouldn\u2019t otherwise have. But both protests have been captured by a small group looking to advance their own agendas.</p> <p>In the case of Black Lives Matters, this is quite obvious. It is hard to take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/climate-change-racist-crisis-london-city-airport-black-lives-matter\" title=\"\">their claim</a> that they are a black-led movement at face value when the City airport protesters were overwhelmingly white and middle-class. They were protesting about climate change, austerity, the migrant crisis: a range of issues they describe as \u201cracialised\u201d because they disproportionately affect black people.</p> <p>The problem is that these are, of course, politically contested issues that black people have different views on: a fact that sits uncomfortably and paternalistically with the implication that anyone not supporting them is not truly anti-racist. Little wonder then that long-standing black activists such as Stafford Scott and Lee Jasper have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/nine-black-lives-matter-protesters-arrested-amid-city-airport-travel-chaos/\" title=\"\">criticised the group\u2019s actions</a> in the strongest term.</p> <p>The junior doctors\u2019 strike is more complex, but similar issues lurk beneath the surface. Back in May, the government and the British Medical Association agreed a compromise contract \u2013 after eight days of Acas negotiations \u2013 that BMA leaders described as safe and fair. Yet they then announced the most extreme strike action the NHS has ever faced. Leaked WhatsApp conversations between BMA committee members suggest that what started as a contractual dispute has morphed into a broader political fight designed to cause maximum pain for the government. Strike action has become associated with political concerns about NHS privatisation and funding.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Irresponsible collective action makes the lives of people trying to create social change in constructive ways difficult</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The public would be justified in asking why BMA leaders think they have the right have to call 15 days of strike action, causing huge risk and suffering to patients, in order to further an ill-defined campaign to \u201csave the NHS\u201d from a democratically elected government. Junior doctors would be justified in asking how the BMA can claim it represents the political views of its entire membership. Many are furious it has not balloted members on the latest strike proposals.</p> <p>There is an historic queasiness on the left about questioning ill-conceived protests that undermine rather than further positive social change. Collective action is part of the left\u2019s birthright. That solidarity, one of the left\u2019s hallowed principles, has created a moral imperative to support all forms of collective action regardless of the consequences.</p> <p>Take the miners\u2019 strike: the NUM\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/arthurscargill\" title=\"\">Arthur Scargill</a> made little secret that his objective was to bring down the Thatcher government. He led his members to strike despite not commanding a majority of their support, and shunned more constructive approaches to saving jobs other unions have taken over the years. Yet he faced little public condemnation from Neil Kinnock despite<a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/i-felt-helpless-during-miners-7891594]\" title=\"\"> the then Labour leader\u2019s private belief </a>that Scargill\u2019s approach was disastrous.</p> <p>Eight years on from the financial crisis, the right has been forced to accept that capitalism manifests itself in responsible and irresponsible ways: this was the dominant theme of Theresa May\u2019s first speech as prime minister. Is it time for the left to similarly confront the reality that collective action can take responsible and irresponsible forms?</p> <p>Irresponsible collective action has warning signs that should make the left wary before it unconditionally offers solidarity. It is often characterised by leaders who pile in multiple and contested political issues while claiming to speak on behalf of politically diverse groups. It lacks clear objectives despite causing significant disruption and harm. And it tends to be characterised by the absolute moral certainty of those taking part, preventing them from engaging with reasonable but difficult questions about their motivations, meaning they fail to hold themselves accountable for the harm their actions may create.</p> <p>The left has a responsibility to question such action because it undermines responsible forms of collective action and social protest. It makes the lives of people trying to create social change in more constructive and representative ways difficult.</p> <p>The BMA is not just leading action that will cause suffering for vulnerable people, it is handing the political right ammunition against the right to take industrial action, recklessly putting it at risk for those who need it to secure improvements in exploitative working conditions \u2013 for example workers at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\" title=\"\">Sports Direct</a> who were not even paid the minimum wage.</p> <p>The campaign against Sports Direct is the antithesis of the airport protest and the doctor strikes: an example of the power of responsible collective action. It has brought together a grassroots campaign, led by the union Unite, parliamentary action by opposition MPs, and investigative journalism that has forced the company to take action.</p> <p>At a time when globalisation and technological progress are concentrating economic power, the left\u2019s commitment to collective action has never been more critical. Movements of citizens, consumers and workers have huge potential in the battle to better hold global corporates and governments to account.

Speaking at Kent State, Sanders said: \u201cThe cornerstone of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is bigotry.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton campaign dispatched two of its most popular progressive surrogates after a rocky week of polls showed Trump gaining on Clinton in Ohio, a critical swing state, and among voters nationally.

Only about 30% of such voters support Clinton, or half the number of young and millennial voters who supported Barack Obama in 2012. </p> <p>On Saturday, both senators touted the benefits of Clinton\u2019s platform for young people before audiences of mostly college students. Sanders spoke about Clinton\u2019s support for pay equity and raising the minimum wage, and about the large sums of money conservative donors such as the Koch brothers have fed into the election. </p> <p>Both senators reserved large portions of their speeches for excoriating Trump over his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/05/donald-trump-muslim-judges-face-the-nation\">racist statements</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/trump-miami-clinton-disarm-security-obama-birther\">insinuations of violence</a> and the bigoted tone of his campaign.</p> <p>The events of this past few days supplied them with plenty of new material.

But even these have collapsed in negotiations, such that the final declaration now reveals only vague principles, denuded of substance by spoiler governments.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s Obama-led Leaders\u2019 Summit is about pledging. Unable to elicit additional resettlement places from Congress, the administration has focused on playing an international convening goal. It has sought commitments in three areas: additional humanitarian assistance, more resettlement places, and a focus on jobs and education. But with states experiencing donor fatigue, significant new pledges seem improbable.</p> <p>The tragedy is that these meetings have become irresponsibly removed from the real challenges on the ground. They will do little to directly address systematic non-compliance with refugee law in Europe or Australia, to ensure that refugees stuck in camps are not indefinitely trapped in limbo, to address the plight of millions of urban refugees, or to define a response to the millions of people who will be displaced by factors such as climate change that fall outside the existing refugee framework.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Today people are mainly fleeing fragile states characterised by mass violence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The summits have largely bypassed the biggest and most urgent questions relating to institutional reform. There is widespread acknowledgement that the system is broken and yet no appetite to fix it. In 1971 the international monetary system reached its crisis moment and reformed; 2016 should be that moment for refugees. Change is needed because the refugee system was created in the early cold war largely to meet US interests in avoiding the return of displaced Germans to the communist bloc. And yet, in a radically changed world, this time-warped framework is still expected to apply.</p> <p>The basic idea in the 1951 Refugee Convention \u2013 that refugees should not be returned to serious harm \u2013 remains as relevant today as ever. However, its focus on refugees as people fleeing \u201cpersecution\u201d has become antiquated. Today people are mainly fleeing fragile states characterised by mass violence. While courts have sometimes managed to shoehorn contemporary displacement into outdated language, the result is arbitrary exclusions and erratic responses: in 2014 recognition rates for Eritrean asylum seekers ranged from 26% in France to 100% in Sweden. Meanwhile for many years Germany would not recognise Somali refugees because the harm they experienced was from non-state actors rather than a persecuting government.</p> <p>Organisational reform is also off the table. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) does what it does very well: humanitarian aid and camp management, and legal advice to states. But these are no longer the primary things a UN refugee agency needs to be doing. The tools needed today are political engagement, development and economics, and the ability to work in urban environments. The disjuncture is exemplified by the stark reality that the overwhelming majority of Syrian refugees receive no assistance whatsoever from UNHCR or its partners. A UN refugee agency remains indispensable but donor states should be asking for an updated model.</p> <p>On the ground, the default model is one of humanitarian assistance in camps. But too many refugees in camps get stuck there for decades, where they usually have no right to work. 56% of the world\u2019s refugees are in protracted situations, having been in exile for at least 5 years. Refuge needs to be reconceived as at least as much about development as about humanitarianism. It needs to offer jobs and education to the nearly 90% of the world\u2019s refugees who are in developing countries, including the majority who are now in cities.</p> <p>Tragically, a vision for legal, organisational and operational reform will not feature on the agenda this week. Addressing these issues is the key to finding sustainable solutions not only to the Syrian crisis but also inevitable future movements.</p> <p>But there may still be hope. In order to save face, the UN conveners will now use 19 September to launch an ongoing two-year intergovernmental process. At the margins of the formal meetings, governments, businesses and civil society have mobilised to launch a range of exciting initiatives. These pathways may still leave the door ajar for meaningful change.</p> <p><em>Alexander Betts is director of the Refugee Studies Centre at the University of Oxford.

  "<p>The Hungarian government\u2019s map of Europe is dotted with stark warnings of \u201cno-go zones\u201d it claims are patrolled by violent immigrants, six in the UK clustered around London alone.</p> <p>The poisonous graphic, in a leaflet handed out to voters ahead of a controversial referendum on refugees, pays no heed to facts or geography but its message is clear. It forms part of an expensive and expansive campaign by authorities in Budapest that is whipping up xenophobic sentiment at home, and sowing tension far beyond Hungarian borders.</p> <p>The ballot, conceived and championed by prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, is ostensibly about whether parliament should allow the European Union to set a quota for refugee resettlement within the country. But critics contend that he is using groundless fear to bolster his position at home and shore up a challenge to Europe.</p> <p>They point out that the ballot comes as Europe is backing away from the mandatory quota system that officially inspired the campaign: there are just a few thousand refugees in Hungary today, and that number is unlikely to rise. Syrians, Afghans and others crossing into Europe are not drawn by dreams of a Hungarian future.</p> <p>\u201cOne has the suspicion that this referendum is not about the refugees, that it is rather about the manipulation of the voters, and some kind of strengthening of positions within the EU,\u201d said pastor G\u00e1bor Iv\u00e1nyi, a one-time ally in the anti-Communist movement who baptised two of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s children. \u201cHungary is not a target country in this refugee crisis.\u201d</p> <p>A campaign that is already spreading hate at home risks having serious fallout for Europe as well, further fracturing leaders already split over everything from the refugee crisis to the euro\u2019s woes, and potentially consolidating Orb\u00e1n\u2019s efforts to challenge the status quo with a bloc of other eastern nations.</p> <p>The language has been so violent that it fuelled demands from one European leader that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/expel-hungary-from-eu-for-hostility-to-refugees-says-luxembourg\" title=\"\">Hungary be expelled from the union</a> for stirring up hatred.</p> <p>Even stalwart supporters of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s initiative often admit they have had no interaction, much less trouble, with outsiders. \u201cI\u2019ve only met foreigners who are tourists and not had any problems,\u201d said cheery retiree L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Czeto, 87, firmly committed to supporting the government. \u201cI just don\u2019t want a lot of people to come to Hungary. I think they are not real refugees.\u201d</p> <p>Yet there are clear political advantages to focusing on refugees \u2013 a target largely absent and unable to respond \u2013 at a time when Hungary is grappling with concerns from rampant graft to failing public services, critics say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8e19e13a3689db61fd77d8bda20a07783cfd7d07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e19e13a3689db61fd77d8bda20a07783cfd7d07/906_56_1227_1534/800.jpg\" alt=\"Viktor Orban has been accused of stirring up hatred.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Viktor Orban has been accused of stirring up hatred.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Klamar/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A recent survey found that four in five young Hungarians think the state is riddled with corruption, and more than half have encountered it themselves. The country comes <a href=\"https://transparency.hu/en/news/perception-of-corruption-and-media-consumption-of-young-people/\" title=\"\">50th in Transparency International\u2019s ranking of corruption worldwide</a>, and the state has been taking power away from anti-corruption bodies.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t want people to speak about problems like corruption, and healthcare, they want people to talk about the nonexistent migrants,\u201d said Gergely Kov\u00e1cs of activist group Two-Tailed Dog, a party originally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/hungary-two-tailed-dog-viktor-orban\" title=\"\">launched as political satire</a> that put pooches up as candidates, with manifestos promising free beer and eternal life to mock empty&#xa0;promises.</p> <p>But as the political landscape in Hungary grew bleaker, its founders were forced to become more serious, although humour is still used as their main weapon. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen so much hate in this country before,\u201d said Kov\u00e1cs. \u201cThey have brought evil out and that\u2019s why we felt we should do something.\u201d</p> <p>A crowdfunded advertising campaign uses ridicule and well-chosen statistics to show up government fear-mongering. A poster warning that a million people in Libya want to come to Europe is matched by one reminding voters that a million Hungarians want to go to Europe; others warn of \u201cdangers\u201d ranging from the risk of drinking water spiked with LSD to medieval bear attacks.</p> <p>There is also a more serious campaign to persuade voters to spoil their ballots, perhaps the only way to fight back against Orb\u00e1n because, in a country with a long history of unease with migrants and extensive government influence over the media, he is guaranteed an overwhelming majority.</p> <p>The only way that victory will be undermined is if turnout fails to meet the relatively high threshold needed for it to be legally binding. A history of voter apathy may be one reason for the aggressive campaign, opponents speculate.</p> <p>The government denies allegations of racism, and says the campaign is strictly factual. Yet it struggles to defend many of its claims, among them the \u201cno-go zone\u201d allegations which have echoes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/12/paris-lawsuit-fox-news-reporting-no-go-zones-non-muslims\" title=\"\">claims made about Paris by US news channel Fox</a>. Questioned about the map, government spokesman Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs claimed it was based on public statistics, but could not provide them to the <em>Guardian</em> and admitted it was deceptive.</p> <p>\u201cIt relates to London. The picture is a bit disproportionate,\u201d he said, when asked about which areas were covered by the warning signs on the UK, sprinkled roughly from Peterborough to Southampton. He went on to cite riots in London\u2019s south-east in 2011, before the Syrian war had begun in earnest, much less the refugee crisis it has sparked.</p> <p>And the campaign is already spreading poison across the country, said Demeter \u00c1ron from Amnesty international, who leads a group of charities monitoring hate crime. \u201cOne young boy, 14, from the poorest part of the country said \u2018migrant\u2019 had already become the playground insult of choice, replacing anti-gay and anti-Roma slurs,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And it has made many of Hungary\u2019s small minority population even more uncomfortable, both on the streets and in a society they already felt was ambivalent. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pay tax so people throw a referendum against me,\u201d said Iranian refugee Behruz, 31, who has lived in Hungary for the past five years. \u201cYou are serving a society that is arming against you.\u201d</p> <p>Immigration offers more opportunity to Hungary than its government will admit, because it has developed a labour crisis more or less in parallel with Europe\u2019s refugee crisis. With hundreds of thousands of young people heading west, there is a huge shortage of workers. Andr\u00e1s Kov\u00e1ts, of charity Mened\u00e9k, which has been working with refugees for more than 20 years, says that for the first time there are no problems finding jobs for new arrivals. \u201cThis is not about moral obligations, businesses need&#xa0;workers.\u201d</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.kormany.hu/en/the-prime-minister/news/hungarians-have-decided-they-do-not-want-illegal-migrants\" title=\"\">immigration sits at the heart of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s challenge to Europe</a>, and so economic growth is not a priority. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to fill [jobs] with migration from other cultures,\u201d Kov\u00e1cs added.</p> <p>Orb\u00e1n has emerged as the most high-profile leader in a group of eastern European countries known as<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/15/eu-summit-in-bratislava-expected-to-live-up-to-low-billing\" title=\"\"> the Visegr\u00e1d four</a> \u2013 Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. They have a combined population equivalent to that of the UK and are increasingly vocal about their frustration with the status quo.</p> <p>In the continent\u2019s current struggles with Brexit and the refugee and economic crises, Orb\u00e1n has seen particular opportunity, talking openly this summer of an eastward shift in Europe\u2019s centre of gravity.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"http://www.kormany.hu/en/the-prime-minister/the-prime-minister-s-speeches/prime-minister-viktor-orban-s-speech-at-the-25th-balvanyos-summer-free-university-and-student-camp\" title=\"\">If there is such a thing as an \u2018old Europe\u2019, it is here,\u201d he told a student conference</a>. \u201cIf we talk about how we envisage the capital of Europe, Budapest comes to mind more often than Brussels does.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps one reason that seems plausible is Orb\u00e1n\u2019s own dramatic political transformation, a full 180-degree turnaround from when he was a firebrand liberal opponent of communism and critic of Moscow, to a man whose economic and political project aligns closely with Russian president Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>\u201cI think he is pretty much aware of the fact that this referendum can contribute to the destabilisation of the EU when it is not in a good state and he knows that Putin will be grateful for that,\u201d said P\u00e9ter Krek\u00f3, an analyst with Hungarian thinktank Political Capital.</p> <p>In October, Orb\u00e1n will be claiming a victory of sorts, even if his opponents or apathy manage to keep turnout low, as the majority polls show he is virtually guaranteed victory. But it will have come at the price of Hungary\u2019s social fabric, and may prove dangerous for Hungary as well as Europe.</p> <p>\u201cThe main message of Christ was against hatred and fear,\u201d said Pastor Iv\u00e1nyi. \u201cSomeone who is building on these evil feelings is unleashing things which he or she will not be able to manage.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The world is on course to register its highest number of migrant deaths this year, as criticism mounts over failing international efforts to cope with the global refugee crisis.</p> <p>Forecasts from analysts at the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) indicate that the number of fatalities among refugees will pass the landmark figure of 10,000 in 2016. The dire statistic will cast a shadow over two high-profile summits on migration in New York this week: on Monday the UN general assembly will meet to discuss the record volume of individuals forced to flee their homes as a result of crises and war around the world.

He said there were now huge concerns that the very foundations of refugee protection were under threat from forced repatriation, border walls and aggressive policing by nation states.</p> <p>The world\u2019s newest country, South Sudan, saw its one millionth citizen flee on Friday \u2013 something which may threaten the progressive, welcoming policies of neighbouring Uganda, where migrants are given land and encouraged to contribute.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da4e648e02da659555613e8a2adbabc61fbc2368\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da4e648e02da659555613e8a2adbabc61fbc2368/0_237_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Refugees outside the city of Jarabulus in Syria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Refugees outside the city of Jarabulus in Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bulent Kilic/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The figure also represents a miserable milestone for another neighbour, Kenya, where hundreds of thousands of other refugees from the Somalian conflict and famine are already living in camps. The east African nation is threatening to close down the largest, at Dadaab, and is coming under fire for its efforts to start trying to push back refugees into their war-torn countries of origin.</p> <p>Pakistan is facing the same criticism for its efforts to forcibly return a number of its 2 million Afghan residents, some of whom have been in the country for years. A clampdown on refugees from Syria coming into Jordan \u2013 a country which already hosts a million Syrians \u2013 has left 75,000 people stranded in a desert no-man\u2019s land between the two countries.</p> <p>Turkey, Bulgaria and Greece have cited a lack of support from other countries for forcing them to take restrictive action on Syrian and Afghan refugees. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s open-door policy in Germany now looks unstable, because of other European countries reacting to the crisis by firmly closing their doors instead of following the German lead, as she had hoped.</p> <p>In Britain, both Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper have called on Theresa May to do more when she goes to New York on Monday. Just one sixth of the cash pledged at a summit hosted by David Cameron in London in February to tackle the refugee crisis in Syria has materialised.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/16/obama-refugees-increase-proposal-us-capable-resettling\">Ignore the naysayers.

Right now the decisions parliament and our country have taken are being mired in red tape and government is foot-dragging. Britain has always done its bit to help those fleeing persecution: we have to live up to those values again.\u201d</p> <p>Farron said he welcomed Obama\u2019s initiative but added: \u201cI am doubtful that anything more substantial than warm words will materialise from this high-level meeting. The thousands of desperate people still drowning in the Mediterranean are testament to the failure of the international community, especially our own government and states across Europe, to safely and fairly deal with refugees fleeing Syria and Iraq, as well as those escaping the poverty of failed states in Africa.\u201d</p> <p>But it is the very lack of cooperation that makes the UN summit vital, according to Mukesh Kapila, professor of humanitarian affairs at Manchester university and a UN adviser.</p> <p>\u201cWe live in an age where even established principles of humanity and decency are under constant threat,\u201d he said. \u201cIn an age where politicians can be elected to power on platforms of lies, and established norms are under threat, there is something to be said for even anodyne statements reiterating our principles.</p> <p>\u201cEven if world leaders have been forced to turn up by the clever move by Obama to have his own second summit \u2013 even if it results in yet more jobs created in New York \u2013 it\u2019s still a red line.</p> <p>\u201cThe humanitarian organisations are rubbing their hands in glee at being able to patronise and criticise. I challenge their self-serving leaders to propose practical solutions, because a safety valve of free movement which only helps those with the capacity and strength [to travel] is no solution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84fed5fa365e9f5b1e75429fde171520db0a0a2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84fed5fa365e9f5b1e75429fde171520db0a0a2d/0_76_5060_3037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man being searched at the US-Mexico border near Rio Grande City, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man being searched at the US-Mexico border near Rio Grande City, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy worry is that this summit will not do refugees a favour because it doesn\u2019t distinguish between refugees and migrants.

I have sympathy for people fleeing illegally for a better life \u2013 one can\u2019t blame them \u2013 but the people facing real poverty cannot put one foot in front of another, let alone migrate across oceans and desert: you only do that if you are fleeing real persecution, or are young and strong and your family have gathered the money together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s great that Ban Ki-Moon has made humanitarian work his focus in his final year, better late than never.\u201d</p> <p>The UN came into being at the time of the last great refugee crisis, when 40.7 million people were displaced from their homes across post-second-world-war Europe, and more in Africa, China and Asia. In that war-battered world, legal and organisational efforts were mounted, two million Soviets were returned home \u2013 some forcibly \u2013 and millions of concentration-camp survivors, forced labourers and other victims of the Nazis were settled in countries such as France, Belgium, and Greece.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/refugee-stories-we-dont-just-need-help-we-can-give-valuable-help-too\">Refugee stories: 'We don't just need help, we can give valuable help too'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That postwar chaos gave birth to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, which guaranteed a \u201cright to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution\u201d, and forbade the arbitrary deprivation of nationality. The Geneva Convention of 1951 defined refugees, accorded them specific rights, and prohibited their forcible return from countries of refuge.</p> <p>But problems remained. \u201cWe have always had enormous difficulty in persuading countries to behave in a international way,\u201d said Kapila, \u201cbut we need now to concentrate on root causes of large population migrations, celebrate those with the ability and courage to stay where they are, when they can, and help solve the myriad causes of unhappiness in the world.</p> <p>\u201cI have no expectations of the summits so I won\u2019t be disappointed,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Ariane Rummery, a UNHCR spokeswoman, said that tomorrow\u2019s expected UN declaration was a \u201cmiracle\u201d. The UN general assembly is <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/news/briefing/2016/9/57ce89db7/un-summit-addressing-large-movements-refugees-migrants.html\">expected to formally adopt a declaration agreed on</a> 2 August, reaffirming the rights of refugees and migrants and pledging support to the countries most affected by large movements of people.</p> <p>\u201cThe sheer number of people forced to flee today means we cannot have \u2018business as usual\u2019,\u201d said Rummery. \u201cUNHCR sees the summit as an extremely positive event \u2013 a historic opportunity to garner the political will of world leaders to save lives, protect rights and share responsibility on a global scale.</p> <p>\u201cThe criticisms overlook the significance of this summit in the current context. The fact that the text of the New York declaration was agreed by 193 member states of the UN represents a significant achievement \u2013 if not a miracle \u2013 in the current context of increased displacement, uncertainty, significant pressures on hosting countries and divisive politicised discussions at the national, regional and international level,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to convert this political will into action to address the drivers and causes of displacement, while helping refugees and communities hosting them.</p> <p>\u201cThe declaration reaffirms key legal principles of refugee protection, including the institution of asylum and the principles of <em>non-refoulement</em>, which prohibits sending people back to countries where they face danger. Importantly, the summit builds upon these key legal instruments to meet the challenges of refugee crises in today\u2019s world, and garnering more global cooperation and responsibility-sharing.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>She has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in both the country of her detention and that of her birth. Condemned to death on drug-smuggling charges, she was temporarily reprieved hours before her execution, but still languishes on death row in an Indonesian prison. And last week the skies darkened again over Mary Jane Veloso, a Filipino maid whose plight has captured the imagination of two populations that know all about the vulnerability of migrant workers.</p> <p>After the Philippines\u2019 president, the newly installed Rodrigo Duterte, visited Jakarta, <a href=\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/09/12/duterte-has-given-the-green-light-for-mary-janes-execution-jokowi.html\">it was reported</a> that he had given his Indonesian counterpart, Joko Widodo, the go-ahead to execute her. Duterte has begun a ferocious and bloody war on drugs in the Philippines. That change of political direction has, it seems, led to yet another twist in the tortured tale of a woman who lost control of her life from the moment she entered Indonesia in 2010, hoping, she has said, to take up a job in domestic service.</p> <p>Amid public outrage in the Philippines, Widodo subsequently clarified that Duterte had said: \u201cPlease, go ahead with the process in line with the law in Indonesia,\u201d without naming Veloso. Few of her supporters were reassured. \u201cWe demand an immediate explanation from President Duterte \u2026 duty-bound to defend the rights of Filipinos overseas, especially drug-trafficking victims like Mary Jane,\u201d said <a href=\"https://migranteinternational.org/\">Migrante International</a>, a group that campaigns for the Veloso family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0090873d752a1b94c0a6ec792905fcf76cf711e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0090873d752a1b94c0a6ec792905fcf76cf711e8/0_35_4316_2589/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cesar and Celia Veloso, Mary Jane\u2019s parents, at a rally in Manila before President Duterte\u2019s visit to Indonesia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cesar and Celia Veloso, Mary Jane\u2019s parents, at a rally in Manila before President Duterte\u2019s visit to Indonesia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romeo Ranoco / Reuters/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born to an impoverished family in the northern city of Cabanatuan, Veloso married at 17 but later separated from her husband. She moved to the United Arab Emirates in 2009 to earn money for her two young sons in the Philippines.</p> <p>Veloso says that she had to flee Dubai after an attempted rape and was then duped into smuggling drugs into Indonesia. Her case has become the focus of sympathy in both the Philippines and Indonesia, where many families have loved ones working abroad, often in poor conditions with abusive employers. Before the original date set for her execution last April, more than 200,000 signatures from 127 countries were collected for a <a href=\"http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/91333-save-mary-jane-top-10-signed-change-org-petitions\">#SaveMaryJane petition.</a></p> <p>Veloso says that a woman called Maria Kristina Sergio, the daughter of one of her godparents, told her to move to Indonesia for a maid\u2019s job in 2010. In an account that Sergio disputes, Veloso says the woman gave her new clothes and a bag that she says she was unaware had 2.6kg (5.7lb) of heroin sewn into it. \u201cWe\u2019re poor and I wanted to change our life, but I could never commit the crime they have accused me of,\u201d Veloso wrote last year in a letter to the then president, Benigno Aquino.</p> <p>Her legal team launched two appeals in Indonesia, one that argued she did not have a competent translator, and a second saying she was scammed. Both were rejected.</p> <p>As her April 2015 execution date approached, protesters in the Philippines and Indonesia rallied to save her and hundreds of people held vigils outside the Indonesian embassy in Manila. Even world boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao made a public plea for her life.</p> <p>Two days before Veloso\u2019s execution date, her family was allowed a visit. She explained to her sons that she would not be coming home. Her youngest child, six-year-old Mark Darren, said he would try to think that \u201cMama is in heaven\u201d.</p> <p>Then Indonesia shot dead eight people, including two Australians, part of the Bali Nine heroin-smuggling ring, four Nigerians, a Brazilian and an Indonesian. But not Veloso, although several newspapers in the Philippines reported she was dead. The hashtag \u201cmaryjanelives\u201d trended on Twitter across the Philippines and Indonesia.</p> <p>The reprieve was down to an unexpected turn of events in her homeland. Veloso\u2019s alleged trafficker, Sergio, had handed herself in to police hours before the execution. And Aquino, invoking a regional treaty that compels nations to co-operate on transnational crime, asked Indonesia to keep Veloso alive. He said she was needed to testify in the case against Sergio and another man, now accused of trafficking, illegal recruitment and fraud.</p> <p>Indonesia\u2019s president insisted that the execution was merely postponed, but the campaign for clemency had new grounds for hope.</p> <p>A year on, the accession of Duterte to the presidency has again changed the dynamics of Veloso\u2019s case. Duterte\u2019s first three months in office have been dominated by a bloody crackdown that has left 3,526 alleged drug dealers and addicts dead, most of them in extrajudicial killings by vigilante groups, actions that were publicly encouraged by Duterte before he was elected.</p> <p>Senator Leila de Lima, who has been leading a senate hearing into the killings and is one of the main domestic critics of Duterte, said that she was \u201csad and heartbroken that the president will throw away all our efforts to save a life just like that, when it is still in his power to request the holding off of the execution\u201d. But it was no surprise, she added, that Veloso\u2019s life might seem of no worth to an administration that had adopted judicial or extrajudicial executions as \u201cgovernment policy\u201d.</p> <p>Even Duterte has said that fighting for Veloso\u2019s life would sit badly with his drugs crackdown. \u201cIt would have left a bad taste in the mouth to be talking about having a strong posture against drugs and here you are begging for something,\u201d he told reporters, adding that he told Widodo he supported the death penalty in Indonesia. Capital punishment was outlawed in the Philippines in 2006.</p> <p>Veloso\u2019s legal team told the <em>Observer</em> it was very concerned. \u201cMary Jane is a victim of dire poverty, of lack of real opportunities for a decent job, of pernicious drug and human trafficking. The law may be the law, but it should not be blind or deaf to reality,\u201d lawyer Edre Olalia wrote in an email. \u201cAs the leader of this nation and as the <em>pater familias</em> of all Filipinos, President Duterte is expected to rise to his bounden duty and fight for her, and fight hard as he does for all victims of this transnational infection.\u201d</p> <p>Widodo\u2019s reported conversation with Duterte has reinvigorated public interest in Veloso\u2019s case and the office of Indonesia\u2019s attorney general said last week that she would not be killed in the next wave of executions. The judge in the case involving Sergio said that she would fly to Indonesia this month to get a deposition from Veloso in her prison cell. Veloso\u2019s supporters believe that a trial can vindicate her, if it can prove she was used as a pawn.</p> <p>\u201cWinning the case will codify Mary Jane\u2019s innocence and erase all doubts that she should be spared from execution,\u201d said Garry Martinez, chair of Migrante International.</p> <p>Ruperto Santos, a prominent Roman Catholic bishop in the Philippines, said that \u201cconflicting reports regarding the actions of President Duterte\u201d on the Veloso case were regrettable. \u201cLet us continue to pray for her, that her life be spared.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 September 2016 to clarify that people killed in the crackdown are alleged, not necessarily proven, to be drug dealers and drug addicts. <br></p>",
  "<p>J.W.

One top, which was divided into four sections with slashed ribboned arms and unfastened belt detail, recalled the classic brocaded Tudor waistcoat in the king\u2019s most famous portrait.

There were the androgynous conical-shaped tops with exaggerated donut sleeves and necklines, and the Christmas tree-like tops and dresses made from a bounty of floating Irish linen. They were bunched together in pastel shades of sea blue, pale canary yellow and pale pink, which floated like waves when the models walked in them and the effect was akin to watching an ice-cream slowly melting in the midday sun. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/05/jwanderson-provocative-new-exhibition-to-reveal-his-inspirations\">J.W.Anderson: 'provocative' new exhibition to reveal his inspirations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Later in the day Donatella Versace, a fashion icon who represents a ultra-feminine European fabulousness, debuted her latest collection from Versus, the Versace spin-off label that is 20-years-old this year.</p> <p>Like Anderson, Versace was interested in giving a persona to her collection.

  "<p>Under prevailing theories of economic voting, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d should not be a good slogan for a time when poverty and unemployment are falling, and household income is rising, as the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/household-income-increase-poverty-us-census-report\">Census report</a> shows. The fact that Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/donald-trump-pretend-populist-economic-policy-plan-estate-tax-high-income-bracket\">faux-populist</a> appeal resonates at all despite this should be evidence enough that it\u2019s not about the economy. In any case, Trump\u2019s more explicit promises about walls and religious tests should make it clear what American greatness really means to him.</p> <p>Yet there are many who take Trump\u2019s claims to an economic populist mantle seriously, including some on the left. So eager are they to find any evidence at all of a burgeoning American class consciousness that they project it onto an unlikely source, one who spends more on hair transplants than most Americans make in a year. </p> <p>The argument, made by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/07/donald-trump-why-americans-support\">Frank</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/how-america-made-donald-trump-unstoppable-20160224\">Taibbi</a>, <a href=\"http://michaelmoore.com/trumpwillwin/\">Moore</a>, and others goes roughly like this: trade is a huge issue ignored by Washington elites. Trump supporters are those who have been economically left behind, particularly by trade. Liberals who say it\u2019s about racism and nativism have their heads in the sand. Trump supporters are simply voting their class interests. This is why Trump will win.</p> <p>I don\u2019t believe any of these things are true. For better or worse, trade is not a major issue in American politics. Neither American voters generally nor Trump voters specifically rank it among their top concerns: only <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/07/19/this-one-survey-shows-why-trump-wont-win-over-sanders-supporters/\">36% of Trump supporters</a> polled said trade was a critical issue to them, well behind terrorism and immigration. Trump supporters are not, overall, economically worse off. A <a href=\"http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=152013104065027077080085071031017102101074051042007060126089031090122097127005079073055020029097121126020121094005109112006086059016075034036069001020105021125087080067045021075124026002079003071084070121024106117127123112081119094073124112082105125073&amp;EXT=pdf\">Gallup study</a> found Trump supporters have higher median incomes than non-Trump supporters, and are no more likely to live in areas affected by trade. Curiously, wealthy Trump supporters report feeling the same level of economic anxiety as poor non-Trump supporters \u2013 which is to say, they think they\u2019re doing worse than they are. This is probably because, as political scientist <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/08/22/economic-anxiety-isnt-driving-racial-resentment-racial-resentment-is-driving-economic-anxiety/\">Michael Tesler</a>\u2019s research shows, voters\u2019 perceptions of how the economy is doing have a lot more to do with their party identities, and attitudes on race, than how the economy is actually doing.</p> <p>And when you <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/6/2/11833548/donald-trump-support-race-religion-economy\">test</a> economic v racial issues against each other as predictors of Trump support, the significance of the economic ones disappears. It isn\u2019t about trade, it isn\u2019t about jobs, it isn\u2019t about economic performance. It\u2019s about demographics, and the sense that the country is looking less and less like what a portion of the electorate imagines it should look like \u2013 a perception that is also exaggerated, since Trump supporters are also no more likely to live in areas affected by immigration.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear what this does not mean: it does not mean that Trump supporters are all cross-burning racists. It does not mean that racial resentment is exclusive to Trump supporters; <a href=\"http://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/Bernie-Sanders-Lifting-up-the-Masses-or-the-Few--20160331-0068.html\">Daniel Byrd and Loren Collingwood</a> found some (though not as many) of Clinton and Sanders supporters reported similar attitudes. It does not mean \u201cAmerica is already great\u201d or that working class Americans haven\u2019t been left behind. It does not mean that there are not many people who support Trump because they feel (real or imagined) economic stress. It means that for every person who votes for Trump because they feel economic stress, there is another person who votes for Clinton for the same reason. If all you know about someone is how hard they were hit by the recession, you\u2019re no more likely to predict their vote than a coin toss. But if all you know about them is how they feel about black people and Muslims, you can make a pretty good guess.</p> <p>So why the credulity on the part of some pundits? It may be a suspicion of polling evidence left over from the primaries (remember, the polls didn\u2019t get Trump wrong, the polling analysts just ignored them), or part of a broader, leftists v liberals culture war over identity politics. Those to the left of the Democrats have been pushing back on what they see as a disproportionate focus by liberals on race, gender, and sexual identity to the detriment of economics. And in this election, there is a justifiable sense that efforts to caricature Trump supporters as Klansmen is an easy way for Democrats to excuse their neglect of their working class base. But replacing that caricature with a new one, that of saintly, if slightly confused, characters from a Steinbeck novel, has even less basis in reality. It\u2019s one thing to say that Americans should vote their class interests more. It\u2019s another to say they do. One is a valid normative argument (which I agree with), another is observably false.</p> <p>Americans have never truly voted along class lines; a working class vote divided by racial issues is not the exception in American politics but the rule. But Trump has a lot of people confusing what is with what ought to be. A better case can be made for a pro-worker platform than fixed ideas about Trump voters. Politicians should cater to working class interests more not because there is, or ever has been, such thing as a unified working class vote, but because it\u2019s the right thing to do.</p>",

  "<p>Presidential campaigns drain away life in many ways. When Bernie Sanders finally returned home to Vermont this summer, after 15 months flying the country in search of the Democratic nomination, a long-abandoned family car had to be jump-started by his wife, Jane.

When Hillary Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">fell ill last Sunday</a>, at a memorial for 9/11 victims in New York, she was on day 518 of an almost non-stop campaign. Despite all predictions of a \u201ccoronation\u201d, that campaign has segued seamlessly from a tougher-than-expected primary fight against Sanders to a battle against Donald Trump that she calls \u201cthe most consequential vote of our lifetimes\u201d.</p> <p>Although Clinton, a former globe-trotting secretary of state, claims a four-day rest has cured the allergy-induced pneumonia which caused her legs to buckle, she remains on a 10-day course of the antibiotic Levaquin and faces more than 5,000 miles of travel and debate prep in the next week alone.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not great at taking it easy, even under ordinary circumstances,\u201d Clinton confided to students on Thursday, as campaign aides watched nervously from the sidelines of a rally in North Carolina. \u201cBut with just two months to go until election day? Sitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be.\u201d</p> <p>One challenge is that many more states are in play than usual. In 1960, Richard Nixon was deemed foolish for promising to visit all 50. Since then, candidates have tended to concentrate on a handful of genuinely competitive battlegrounds \u2013 with just brief fundraising forays to rich coastal donors to interrupt an otherwise intense focus on Middle America\u2019s swing voters.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s appeal to blue-collar Democrats (and rejection by more educated Republicans) has added places like Michigan and Arizona to the list that may determine who gets to sit in the Oval Office. Opinion polls suggest the national race is on a knife-edge.</p> <p>The vast distances of a politically-fractured US are exacerbated by a desire among both candidates to head home to New York each night, to sleep in their own beds wherever possible. Though Clinton has a house in Washington DC, she prefers to point her Boeing 737 toward the leafy suburb of Chappaqua, then return to nearby Westchester airport each morning.</p> <p>Even Trump, whose Boeing 757-200 is configured for just 43 passengers and has a silk-lined master bedroom to go with his gold taps, favours leaving \u201cTrump Force One\u201d at Teterboro airport in New Jersey and sleeping in his Manhattan tower.</p> <p>Neither campaign jet can match the logistical polish provided to the victor. The president\u2019s fleet of planes and helicopters provides a near frictionless ability to stroll from the Resolute desk and be in the air, surrounded by an array of modern communications, within minutes. Aboard Air Force One, there is a Zen-like calm that feels very different to the chaos of a campaign plane.</p> <p>While Trump occasionally shows off by buzzing crowds with his helicopter, the reality of daily commuting for both candidates is a cumbersome secret service convoy shuttling them from private airport terminals to college gymnasiums and conference arenas, a nauseating blur of identikit rallies.</p> <p>One handicap they do increasingly share with the commander-in-chief is the almost constant presence of cameras. Faced with criticism about hiding from the press, both candidates recently agreed to let journalists travel on their planes.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s enlarged jet was quickly littered with <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/us/politics/hillary-clinton-campaign-plane.html?_r=0\">banana peels, monogramed cocktail napkins and power cords</a>; Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/donald-trump-campaign-ohio-fair-plane-media\">white leather chairs and polished woodwork were marred</a> by the sight of reporters shuttling back and forth to a separate cabin, because they could not sit on the floor during take-off.</p> <p>This is the real reason why both candidates add to grueling itineraries by flying back to the east coast most nights. Even though, or perhaps because, they are surrounded by dozens of burly secret service agents at all times, there is a little privacy on the trail.</p> <p>Hotel floors tend to be block-booked, but that only increases the difficulty of avoiding awkward encounters with staff. Though Clinton hid her pneumonia from all but the closest of confidants, a slew of others inside the bubble later revealed that they too had been hit by an epidemic of exhaustion-related viruses.</p> <p>Explaining her reluctance to allow a \u201cprotective pool\u201d \u2013 reporters who follow candidates and presidents wherever they go \u2013 Clinton told aides she wanted to preserve the ability to \u201cgo out for ice cream in the middle of the night\u201d without scrambling the press vans.</p> <p>Yet spontaneity is an undoubted casualty of life already. \u201cLike a lot of women, I have a tendency to over-prepare.

  "<p>Halfway through my interview with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, Laura Alvarez, his wife, turns up with a pot of homemade blackberry and apple jam for one of his assistants. \u201cIt\u2019s from the allotment,\u201d Corbyn says proudly. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have a balance in life.

I think you have to have an understanding of other things in life, not just the immediacy of politics.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re in a cafe in London\u2019s Finsbury Park, a short walk from Corbyn\u2019s home and in the constituency he has represented for 23 years. His voice is quiet, deep and even, a baritone with limited range. It\u2019s amazing he\u2019s not hoarse. In the past week, he has held two rallies in London and one in Essex, before a short tour of Scotland (Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee).</p> <p>He arrives 20 minutes late, having just been at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/nottinghillcarnival\">Notting Hill carnival</a> children\u2019s day. I ask what he\u2019s reading now. \u201cA history of Iceland. I didn\u2019t know much about Iceland,\u201d he concedes, but after a public interview he did with the novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-okri\">Ben Okri</a> this summer, he was handed a great stack of tomes and has been going through them. \u201cIt\u2019s an old book about the lores of Iceland, and its development on Danish-based Christianity, and the levels of slavery and indebtedness of small farmers in Iceland. I\u2019ve only got 100 pages in, so we\u2019re around the late 18th century.\u201d</p> <p>Politicians usually confect answers about their cultural input to suggest some untapped creativity, or a hip alter ego. Often the plan unravels. In 2006 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/sep/24/uk.arts\">Gordon Brown said he loved the Arctic Monkeys</a>, only to prove incapable of naming a single song. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/18/popandrock.politicsandthearts\">David Cameron claimed the Jam\u2019s Eton Rifles was his favourite song</a>, only to have Paul Weller retort, \u201cWhich part of it didn\u2019t he get? It wasn\u2019t intended as a fucking jolly drinking song for the cadet corps.\u201d</p> <p>But, for better or worse, Corbyn isn\u2019t like other politicians. He might have said he was reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/elena-ferrante\">Elena Ferrante</a>\u2019s novels, to suggest he was in touch with his feminine side, or a book of world war two poetry to connect with older voters (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a> has an enormous 105-point lead in favourability among the UK\u2019s eldest voters). Instead, Corbyn just tells you what he\u2019s actually reading. If it sounds weird or boring or both, so be it. He couldn\u2019t be less calculated.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Communication is everything. Could we do things differently? Probably. It\u2019s something I want to develop</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Given the performative element to modern political leadership, this does, of course, present a potential liability. Asked if he would use nuclear weapons, Corbyn has said simply: \u201cNo.\u201d (He might have said: \u201cThe whole point is that if you have them you\u2019ll never use them, but I think the money would be better spent elsewhere.\u201d) Asked before the referendum how passionate he was about the EU on a scale of one to 10, he said, \u201cSeven, seven and a half.\u201d (He might have said: \u201cMy passion for staying in is a 10. But there are things we can and should improve.\u201d) The problem, his critics say, isn\u2019t just that he won\u2019t play the game; it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t even know the rules.</p> <p>For many of his supporters, this is part of the appeal. They are fed up with the game. For them, his ability to speak his mind unselfconsciously, to be guided by conviction rather than pollsters and spin doctors, gives him an air of authenticity they feel has been lost. Last month I watched Corbyn address a packed auditorium in Chelmsford. \u201cI love acting,\u201d he told the crowd, to laughter and applause. \u201cThat\u2019s why I go to the theatre, because I really enjoy drama. But when I\u2019m in parliament I want to see political representation on behalf of ordinary people, not drama.\u201d</p> <p>Over a cup of tea a few days later, I ask if he entirely rejects the notion that there are certain ways a leader has to perform. \u201cI don\u2019t reject it outright. I\u2019m trying to remould it, because communication is everything. If you can\u2019t communicate your views, you\u2019re not getting anywhere. Could we do things differently? Probably. It\u2019s something I want to develop.\u201d</p> <p>But he is confident when connecting with voters on a personal level. As we walk through his constituency, he chats to a kebab shop owner he knows by name. A few minutes later, he is confronted by a young man on the street.</p> <p>\u201cYo! Corbyn, man. Why you pull us out the EU?\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn stops. \u201cI didn\u2019t, actually. I wanted to stay in and reform it. I think there were some problems with it, but I wanted to stay in and fix them.\u201d</p> <p>A little further on, another man approaches. He\u2019s a musician and remembers a time when Corbyn advocated for his band. The area is gentrifying and space is tight; Corbyn helped negotiate with a local landlord to make a room available for them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71d1e1b38e6effc332ac2a0c05c7c893b08e959a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71d1e1b38e6effc332ac2a0c05c7c893b08e959a/0_84_1647_988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corbyn with Angela Eagle and Andy Burnham in the House of Commons in February\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Angela Eagle and Andy Burnham in the House of Commons in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pixel8000</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The public is something Corbyn clearly feels a part of, not a place he goes for votes and events. \u201cI\u2019m very keen on not spending all my time in Westminster,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are any number of meetings you can endlessly have, so I have quite a tough rule that, from Thursday onwards, I\u2019m around the country. And at least one full day a week, I\u2019m here in the constituency. I\u2019ve observed many Labour MPs and leaders over the years who, without really thinking about it, become cut off. You are offered all sorts of opportunities to be separate from the rest of the population, and it can all be very enticing and quite nice. But in reality, it can be very dangerous, because you can be completely removed from the people who put you there in the first place. It\u2019s not an easy balance.\u201d</p> <p>He has found the shift in pace and profile over the past year a challenge. \u201cYou suddenly realise you\u2019re under scrutiny the whole time. You find yourself being cautious about random conversations on the street, because you don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going.\u201d Pointing to Alvarez, he says: \u201cWe were in Fort William, having two days off, eating chips in a restaurant, and suddenly it appears in the Sunday Times.\u201d What was the story? \u201cThat I was having chips in a restaurant in Fort William!\u201d He laughs. \u201cAs though I was not somehow doing my job properly.\u201d</p> <p>But this is still the part of the job Corbyn does well, meeting supporters and constituents: he has an easy, unaffected manner that escapes many politicians. Of all the gaffes there have been and will, no doubt, continue to be, Corbyn seems unlikely to ensnare himself in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/28/gordon-brown-gillian-duffy-transcript\">Gillian Duffy \u201cbigoted woman\u201d</a> moment. He does retail politics well: one person, one conversation, one handshake. The bigger issue is whether he can do wholesale.</p> <p>***</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5950a1857e99e5c0fcbd7d4920a95a352ebfc497\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5950a1857e99e5c0fcbd7d4920a95a352ebfc497/188_348_3849_4410/873.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"873\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Borden/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clearly Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s appeal goes beyond Finsbury Park. Over the past couple of months, I have attended three leadership campaign meetings. This year\u2019s events have been bigger than the last. There were a thousand at the Hilton in Brighton, with a further 500 outside whom Corbyn addressed in the drizzle; a capacity crowd of around 500 in Chelmsford civic theatre, a town that has had a Tory MP since 1950; a similar number in the Caird Hall complex in Dundee, where Labour has been eclipsed by the SNP.</p> <p>Meetings aren\u2019t movements. Nor are they necessarily indicators of potential electoral success. But they are not nothing, either. Across the western world, membership of political parties, interest in politics in general and voter turnout in particular are in decline. So when a man rejected by almost all his parliamentary colleagues, leading a party that last year suffered its second election defeat in a row, is packing out venues across the country, it\u2019s noteworthy.</p> <p>These big meetings are where Corbyn draws much of his political energy. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unprecedented,\u201d he tells me when we meet in London. \u201cIt\u2019s never happened in my lifetime and I\u2019ve been in the Labour party since I was 16. And they are not all Labour supporters. In Cornwall, we did a headcount and only half were, but they came \u2013 so there is an appeal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The PLP don\u2019t want Corbyn to succeed. I was loyal through Brown and Blair. Why can\u2019t they be loyal through this?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These are campaign rallies only in the loosest sense of the word. From the stage, people are asked to join the phone bank; some come wearing Corbyn T-shirts. But in the rallies I went to, the Labour leader never once asked for anyone\u2019s vote. Of more than a dozen speakers, only one, in Dundee \u2013 who gave a laundry list as to why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-smith\">Owen Smith</a> was unsuitable to lead a progressive movement \u2013 raised the subject of Corbyn\u2019s challenger. Nobody I interviewed in the audience mentioned Smith, either. It wasn\u2019t that they were studiously refusing to talk about him; he just wasn\u2019t on their radar.</p> <p>At least one speaker will point out, more in sorrow than in anger, that they had a meeting just like this last year to elect Corbyn; now they have to do it again. His supporters tell me how disappointed they are that the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) cannot accept the decision, and complain about the way the media has treated him. \u201cThe PLP don\u2019t want him to succeed,\u201d says Anne Pissaridou, a Labour member all her life and until recently a local councillor in Brighton; she lost her seat to the Tories by a couple of hundred votes last year. \u201cI stuck it out through Brown and Blair, and was loyal. I don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t be loyal through this.\u201d</p> <p>Each rally has its own flavour. In Brighton, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/15/labour-suspends-brighton-branch-amid-accusations-of-improper-ballot\">the local party was suspended</a> in July over allegations of abusive behaviour and an improper ballot (those at the rally insist the only thing irregular about the ballot was that so many people turned up, they couldn\u2019t fit them all into the venue), they dwell on democracy; in Chelmsford, the audience cheer a demand for a better rural bus service; in Dundee, a speaker warns of the perils of nationalism north and south of the border.</p> <p>But while Corbyn\u2019s speech varies slightly, his role is always the same. He is introduced to a standing ovation. Dressed in slacks, tieless shirt and sandals I assumed were Clarks, but Alvarez tells me are from Mexico, Corbyn has the beard of a professor and the pate of a friar. Bookish and ascetic, aesthetically and stylistically he owes more to Labour\u2019s methodist wing than to its union origins.</p> <p>Oratory is not Corbyn\u2019s strong suit; he employs not a single metaphor. His voice rises and falls to its own logic, but its cadence seems to bear little relation to what he is saying. He often emphasises the word <em>is</em>, as though the verb <em>to be</em> is his point: \u201cHousing <em>is</em> the most important issue.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14b52105844cb0bfc7f1264f76c465ae612716e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14b52105844cb0bfc7f1264f76c465ae612716e9/0_135_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corbyn supporters at a leadership rally in London in August\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters at a leadership rally in London in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Mckay</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By this stage in the campaign, he has spoken at more than 30 rallies, giving more or less the same speech. You\u2019d think he\u2019d have it down by now, but he fluffs his lines a few times every night. There are awkward moments where the crowd aren\u2019t sure if he\u2019s finished his point, or is about to move on, and will either clap in the wrong place or watch him end his point in silence. Still, when he finishes there is another standing ovation. People have not come to be entertained; they have come to be reassured that the language of public ownership, redistribution, of caring and support, has not been retired from the public sphere: to have a basic sense of decency reflected back to them through their politics.</p> <p>His supporters have been derided as \u201cCorbynistas\u201d, conjuring the image of pamphleteers and paper-sellers, ideologues and didacts \u2013 unbiddable devotees to Jude the Apostle, the patron saint of lost causes. But while there is a hard core of fanatics on social media, one struggles to find an archetypal \u201cCorbynista\u201d at any of these rallies. The people I spoke to were far more varied and less easy to caricature. There was the self-employed craftswoman who voted for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham\">Andy Burnham</a> in the last leadership election; Pissaridou, who voted for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/yvette-cooper\">Yvette Cooper</a> (\u201cI was torn, but I regretted it. I think he has the policies we\u2019ve wanted for a long time\u201d); and Simon, the Dundee brewer who backed the SNP at the last general election. \u201cIf Corbyn had been leader, I would have voted Labour,\u201d he says. \u201cI still don\u2019t think Labour stands a chance in Scotland at the moment. But they could do eventually, with someone like him.\u201d Others in Dundee felt that the lure of the SNP would soon fade.</p> <p>Some, like James Ellis, a former Green member in Brighton, joined Labour after the general election in 2015. \u201cLabour was opening up,\u201d he says, \u201cand I needed to be in it, so I was really happy when Jeremy decided to stand.\u201d Others, like Bruce Whitehead, a former journalist and freelance musician from Edinburgh, joined Labour from the small hard left party <a href=\"http://leftunity.org/\">Left Unity</a>, the day after Corbyn won the leadership. (The day after I spoke to him, Whitehead received a message from the Labour party that he would be purged, citing social media insisting he is still a member of Left Unity; he is appealing.)</p> <p>Everyone has their own wishlist of what they want Corbyn to do with his mandate. \u201cI\u2019d like him to articulate a simple, concise vision that will attract people who aren\u2019t political nerds like me,\u201d Pissaridou says. \u201cHe needs to speak to those 52% of people who voted for Brexit,\u201d Ellis says. Emerging from Corbyn\u2019s rally in Dundee, Danny McDonald was disappointed that he hadn\u2019t given a clearer idea of how he\u2019d fund his policies.</p> <p>The rallies may be big, but ideologically they are tame. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> was running for the Democratic nomination in the US, he railed against billionaires, bankers and corporations. Corbyn talks about renationalising the railways, building more houses and reaching out to people with mental health problems. There is no talk of neoliberal globalisation, quoting of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Antonio-Gramsci\">Gramsci</a>, or appeals for intersectional thinking. In Dundee, a band sang the Internationale and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwbzxemJZIc\">There Is Power In A Union</a>, and socialism was mentioned several times. That was as radical as it got. In Chelmsford, Anna Wallbank, a primary school teacher, told me: \u201cIf someone better came along, I\u2019d vote for them.\u201d</p> <p>***</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People said: \u2018You must make plans for when you win.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Don\u2019t talk about it.\u2019 I thought it was tempting fate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Jeremy Corbyn decided to stand as leader in summer 2015, he didn\u2019t think he would win. Indeed, the fear was that his defeat would reveal just how small the left in the party really was. Older leftwing candidates such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell\">John McDonnell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/diane-abbott\">Diane Abbott</a> had already stood, while younger MPs were considered too inexperienced. He was an accidental candidate.</p> <p>\u201cEverything sort of took off,\u201d he says now. \u201cI was straight into hustings. Like, the next day. And that week I was on the road travelling. We didn\u2019t have a campaign. We didn\u2019t have an organisation. We didn\u2019t have any money. All we had was my credit card. That lasted about a week. Then we started raising money. We got a loan from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/unite\">Unite</a>. John McDonnell took over as chair of the campaign. Then we started appointing people and getting a campaign together. Time for reflection was very limited because from the moment I was nominated I was on a train.\u201d</p> <p>More unions came on board. The rallies got bigger. The polling numbers soared. What had been unthinkable became first possible, then likely and finally inevitable. But for all the energy and endorsements, one of the last people to realise Corbyn might win was Corbyn himself. \u201cI was still not convinced by the end of August. I would go into the office and they would say: \u2018Look, Jeremy, you have to make plans for when you win.\u2019 And I said, \u2018I\u2019m not even going there. Please don\u2019t talk about it.\u2019 I thought it was tempting fate.\u201d</p> <p>Anyone who thinks the year that followed has been about the failings and foibles of one man simply hasn\u2019t been paying attention. Corbyn emerged from a volatile and fractured political moment, both nationally and globally, a moment accentuated by the financial crisis. In Britain, scandals over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\">phone hacking</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/mps-expenses\">MPs\u2019 expenses</a> and Operation Yewtree and its consequences have left many disaffected with both the political and media establishments. Meanwhile, there is a generation that has known only austerity and war, and has a future of debt and work insecurity to look forward to. Throughout the western world, mainstream parties on left and right have lost influence as they drift to the centre, leaving space at the margins for more populist challengers.</p> <p>\u201cI feel the world as stranger to me than I ever felt before,\u201d said the renowned academic, Stuart Hall in 2007. \u201cIt\u2019s when everyone is operating in so many of the same parameters that the only debate you can have is a sort of Swiftian debate - you know, shall we eat the children now or later?\u201d</p> <p>Few people foresaw Corbyn\u2019s victory. Nobody could have guessed that a range of disparate movements around war, feminism, education, inequality would converge on the Labour party. Nobody could have guessed that this would be the moment when New Labour would lose not only its ideological appeal, but plausible advocates to carry its project forward. Nobody could have guessed that one of the least charismatic, most diffident figures of the British left would emerge as the standard-bearer for a new kind of politics, at 66. His ascendancy did not prompt a crisis in the Labour party; it illustrated it.</p> <p>Since establishments do not, by definition, radicalise themselves, Corbyn needed a plan to make his leadership work. It soon became clear he didn\u2019t have one. And since insurrectionaries don\u2019t easily give up the power they have acquired, his opponents needed a plan to remove him. It has taken the best part of a year to become clear they didn\u2019t have one, either.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7be0333cb6bb954037da6724491ad9624790733\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7be0333cb6bb954037da6724491ad9624790733/0_10_2082_1456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn with David Cameron at the state opening of parliament in May 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With David Cameron at the state opening of parliament in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a result, for the last year Corbyn has been a political pi\u00f1ata, whacked mercilessly from all sides. Mauled by the press, maligned by his own MPs, ridiculed by the government, he has lurched from crisis to crisis and challenge to challenge, with coup threats and mass resignations alongside accusations of bullying, antisemitism and sexism.</p> <p>Corbyn insists he will do everything in his power to ensure a climate of intimidation and exclusion does not dominate. \u201cI don\u2019t do abuse, I don\u2019t do bullying and I won\u2019t tolerate it from anyone associated with my teams, supporters or anyone else,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to say to everyone in the Labour party that this is a safe place to be. I don\u2019t accept any kind of abuse or intimidation, misogyny, homophobia, racism, antisemitism or Islamophobia, and we are taking action against it as a party.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Corbyn\u2019s team feel he is being held to a different standard, pointing to how little interest the press shows in exposing racism within Tory party ranks, for example.</p> <p>But the anticipated debacle prompted by Corbyn\u2019s leadership has yet to materialise. Labour has won all four of the byelections held since he was elected, upping its share of the vote in three and dipping by just 0.3% in the other. In mayoral elections, Labour has won Bristol and London, key cities it had previously lost; in local elections, it has outpolled the Tories and retained control of key bellwether towns such as Nuneaton and Stevenage. In a poll taken shortly before the EU referendum, Labour was even with the Tories.</p> <p>But the PLP\u2019s vote of no confidence and subsequent leadership challenge, just as the Tories dusted themselves off and elected a new prime minister, have had an impact. In the most recent YouGov poll, Labour are 14 points behind. A poll last month put the new prime minister\u2019s net favourability rating at +33.6 and Corbyn\u2019s at -30.7. Given the pollsters\u2019 failure to predict the last election, his own election and Brexit, Corbyn can be forgiven for not putting too much store by such figures. Nonetheless, he has a steep hill to climb.</p> <p>Not all of the parliamentary party was rooting for him to fail. Some members, while sceptical, were prepared to try to make it work. Many criticise not his policies but his leadership style. In a <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/08/labour-mp-any-other-job-jeremy-corbyn-would-have-faced-industrial-tribunal\">New Statesman article</a> last month, Newcastle MP Chi Onwurah claimed Corbyn had appointed her shadow minister for culture and the digital economy, then given half the job to Thangam Debbonaire, MP for Bristol West, without telling either of them \u2013 only to then give that portion back to Onwurah without telling Debbonaire. \u201cNo one knew what he wanted us to do,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf this had been any of my previous employers in the public and private sectors, Jeremy might well have found himself before an industrial tribunal.\u201d (Asked for comment, a Corbyn spokesperson responded: \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon to have discussions about the delineation of these roles, but at no point was anybody sacked or singled out.\u201d)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/heidi-alexander\">Heidi Alexander</a>, former shadow minister for health, has written that she was \u201cexcited\u201d to be given that job and tried her best: \u201cA leader who had been willing to engage, support, take difficult decisions and able to build a team might have made it work. But we didn\u2019t have one, and in Jeremy Corbyn, as much as it pains me to say it, we never will.\u201d Alexander said she was repeatedly undermined by John McDonnell. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t good enough for the leader to routinely defer to his shadow chancellor when confronted with a difficult decision \u2013 a shadow chancellor who on three separate occasions undermined my efforts to agree collective positions on health matters.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Theresa May's education bill restricts access. Now she wants to repeal our human rights act. We have to be campaigning</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But when I raise Alexander\u2019s complaints, Corbyn seems genuinely baffled. \u201cI was particularly surprised at Heidi\u2019s saying that, because Heidi and I had many discussions over the handling of the junior doctors\u2019 dispute, for example, and general health policy,\u201d he says. But you get the sense that the criticism doesn\u2019t come completely from left field. \u201cDid I defer to John McDonnell? John McDonnell is pretty clear in his views and setting them forward. I have an approach that is probably more [one] of listening and less declamatory. She took that as not showing leadership. I try to summarise conversations at the end of them and move on from there. And I hope Heidi will recognise that it\u2019s a style she might be misreading.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the infighting, Corbyn believes he has managed to shift the national conversation. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate what\u2019s happened in the past year,\u201d he says. \u201cI was elected in a very surprising set of circumstances, and we challenged fundamentally the economic agenda. Now [our] anti-austerity agenda is almost the norm. Everybody says, well, now you have to invest in the economy rather than cut. There\u2019s been a fundamental change and we will continue in that direction.\u201d</p> <p>How does he plan to do that? \u201cWe\u2019ll reach out and try to be as precise and campaigning as we can in policy areas,\u201d he says. \u201cTake housing policy. Building council housing, providing starter mortgages and regulating the private rented sector: that is something that has a lot of resonance beyond Labour voters. I will also be emphasising the contradictions in Theresa May, who stands on the steps of Downing Street like St Francis of Assisi, and then produces a higher education bill that further restricts access. Now she is proposing a British bill of rights which will repeal our human rights act.\u201d</p> <p>It is an interesting paradox that pugnacious politics should come in the form of such an unassertive man. When it comes to delivering memorable zingers against the Tories, Corbyn just doesn\u2019t have it in him. The issue isn\u2019t that he doesn\u2019t think quickly on his feet: it\u2019s that, even if he did, he wouldn\u2019t \u2013 he just thinks it\u2019s unhelpful.</p> <p>Does he plan to do prime minister\u2019s questions any differently if he wins? \u201cI find the traditional way of doing it completely off-putting. On one level, it can be quite funny. But it\u2019s remote from everybody\u2019s lives.\u201d Does he think his idea of crowdsourcing questions works? \u201cIt gets a very bad press from the Westminster media corps. Quite a lot of the parliamentary Labour party don\u2019t like it. But people I meet around the country quite frankly do like it. They say, you\u2019ve actually changed it in a good way. It makes more sense to us. So I\u2019ll develop it and work on it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a personally combative person,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have strong political views. I obviously do. But it\u2019s not my approach, which most people find frustrating. My supporters say, \u2018You should be tougher. You should sock it to \u2019em. Get heavy.\u2019 It\u2019s not my style. I have a point of view. I try to listen a lot, and to be a representative of those who don\u2019t feel represented.\u201d</p> <p>This frustrates some of his core supporters, too. A publisher friend told me about a boozy London dinner party with a group of leftwing stalwarts, including an academic, campaign organiser and film director. They went around the table giving Corbyn marks out of 10 for his performance so far. The lowest was two; the highest seven; the mean was around three. The only thing they were agreed on was that they would all vote for him again. Having laboured so long for a left insurgency within Labour, they didn\u2019t want to hand the reins back to the Blairites. They would like to see Corbyn translate the energy and optimism of his rallies into something more effective.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"573d96ba76fc6cbb632e0f89a4c0c61540af1abb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/573d96ba76fc6cbb632e0f89a4c0c61540af1abb/164_101_3838_2640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn with Shami Chakrabarti in June 2016, at the launch of her report into antisemitism in Labour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Shami Chakrabarti in June, at the launch of her report into antisemitism in Labour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ideological divisions in the party may be deep, Corbyn says, but that should not preclude cooperation on a range of issues. \u201cRead the diaries of certain Labour cabinet ministers: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labourconference.labour\">Castle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/oct/06/uk.iraq1\">Crossman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/22/tony-benn-peter-wilby-reads-diaries\">Benn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/07/politics-biography-chris-mullin\">Chris Mullin</a> and many others. All kinds of people manage to work together. Barbara Castle\u2019s 1975 social security pensions act was a great achievement, and that was done with a whole bunch of people who didn\u2019t particularly like each other, who didn\u2019t agree on most things \u2013 but it did get through. So it can be done. But it\u2019s also a question of how you take things forward. If we can be seen to be successfully attacking the Tories, as we did on academisation, then I think we will make a great deal of progress.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn has proposed investing \u00a3500bn in infrastructure and manufacturing, backed by a publicly owned national investment bank and regional banks. He wants to build at least half a million council houses, to introduce rent controls and a charter of private tenants\u2019 rights.</p> <p>What would he do differently if he had his year again? \u201cI would be better prepared for the media onslaught. I knew it was going to be difficult. But even I was surprised at the levels of refusal to engage, or to try to understand what we\u2019re trying to achieve.\u201d</p> <p>If Corbyn is re-elected next week, as seems likely, the key question is: what will change? The PLP is the same; the media is the same; the party is the same. One would hope that his detractors have a more sophisticated plan than they did last year, in which they will engage with the meaning of Corbyn\u2019s victory, if not with him. But one would also hope that he has devised a way to get from where he is \u2013 popular in the party, unpopular in the country at large, unworkable in parliament \u2013 to where he wants to be.</p> <p>Corbyn says he plans to take the lead on issues such as housing and education, with policies he thinks most of the party can rally around. But if he leads, will the party follow? \u201cI\u2019ll be saying, in a kindly way, \u2018There is an awful lot we can campaign on together. If we do that, we\u2019re going to be effective. If we don\u2019t do that, we won\u2019t.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But will that be enough? \u201cIf Labour party members and supporters re-elect me, that will be a second mandate in a year. Respect for the mandate is about respect for democracy itself.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds as if he plans to appeal to MPs\u2019 better nature, even if he may have exhausted their goodwill. \u201cI\u2019m sure they all have better natures,\u201d Corbyn says, with an impish smile. \u201cI\u2019ll rely on the best natures that can come out. A lot of people say lots of things in the heat of the moment. But of course I\u2019ve made mistakes, and of course we need to do better. We certainly can\u2019t carry on as we did.</p> <p>\u201cI will put it to them that I\u2019ve got a mandate, if I\u2019m elected. I\u2019ll put it to them that the mandate is about the policies I\u2019m trying to put forward. Not every dot and comma and crossed T, or whatever.

Whatever people say about those chapters, the book as a whole will provide a background text to the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton this weekend, after another major setback (the Brexit vote); and we will hear a great deal more about building a cross-party platform on the left.</p> <p>Lib Dems are all optimists at heart. They have to be. But there are some rather obvious barriers to a pan-left platform at the next election: three in particular.</p> <p>First, there are no mechanisms in any of the formal party structures to organise a formal pact. It will take every particle of Paddy Ashdown\u2019s considerable energy, through his new <a href=\"http://www.moreunited.uk/\" title=\"\">More United</a> platform, to make it remotely possible for anyone to stand down in favour of anyone else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"593d6f55eaf0d14dbcf3a5c9f192d4c82ae73767\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/593d6f55eaf0d14dbcf3a5c9f192d4c82ae73767/0_114_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paddy Ashdown campaigns for remain before the EU referendum, with Neil Kinnock and David Cameron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paddy Ashdown (centre) campaigns for remain before the EU referendum, with Neil Kinnock and David Cameron. \u2018It will take every particle of Ashdown\u2019s considerable energy, through his More United platform, to make anyone stand down in favour of anyone else.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I also admit to a bias here. I wasted my whole 20s fruitlessly helping to negotiate between Liberal and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/26/labour-party-split-sdp-candidate\" title=\"\">SDP</a> ambitions in Oxford, and I\u2019m not keen on doing the same with my 60s.</p> <p>Second, Labour party members dislike each other so much that they seem unable to work together, let alone with anyone outside. And angry purists on the left seem to hate people who think slightly differently more than they hate the other side.</p> <p>Third, and rather less obviously, the formal parties of the left \u2013 Labour, Lib Dems and Greens \u2013 have long since become bored by economics, forgetting that any winning platform must include a challenging recipe for creating prosperity.</p> <p>There never was a period in recent history when a better way of doing this was needed more, given that we are subservient to an economy devoted to funnelling money upwards to billionaires, from where it patently fails to trickle down.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Angry purists on the left seem to hate people who think slightly differently more than they hate the other side</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet the left has abandoned this agenda to the right, concentrating instead \u2013 and rather patronisingly \u2013 on welfare. Another matter entirely.</p> <p>We might address one or possibly two of these barriers before the next general election, which we have to assume will take place in 2020, but the chances of tackling all three seem pretty remote.</p> <p>But don\u2019t let\u2019s give up. There are two things we must do to bridge the chasms that divide the left. We need to so some cross-party thinking, as set out in my new book, <a href=\"http://radix.org.uk/work/death-liberal-democracy/\" title=\"\">The Death of Liberal Democracy?</a> \u2013 written with Joe Zammit-Lucia and also published in time for conference season. We can also use our political institutions to make things happen.</p> <p>That sounds obvious, but it isn\u2019t. All too often the opportunities to reach out across party lines, to cooperate to change the law in parliament and beyond, get stymied because of obscure and irritating rivalries between opposition parties \u2013 and because their priorities and strategies are different.</p> <p>Yet the government has only a slim majority. Imagine if we could agree across party lines to use parliament for shared objectives.</p> <p>We might not be able to have an impact on the big, symbolic policy areas \u2013 shifting the NHS or changing fiscal priorities \u2013 but we could do something.</p> <p>If we wanted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/25/dont-privatise-rbs-break-it-up-into-local-banks-urges-nef-thinktank\" title=\"\">break up Royal Bank of Scotland into local lending institutions</a>, we could hammer out a cross-party strategy to achieve that. If we wanted all public service contracts to be in the public domain, ending commercial confidentiality for public services, we could do that too.</p> <p>It might sound unexciting. It might stretch parliamentary conventions. There will be squabbles about who can claim the credit. But if we can achieve things together \u2013 then and only then can we be united enough to be a bit more ambitious.</p>",

In his campaign ad, the CDU candidate and current deputy mayor Frank Henkel promises to boost the police force by 750 officers and spend an additional \u00a22m (\u00a31.7m) on new equipment, in particular \u201chigh-resolution CCTV cameras at all underground and overground train stations\u201d.</p> <p>In a city with historic sensitivities around surveillance, Henkel\u2019s team hopes fears of terrorism and a high-profile criminal case have changed attitudes. Last year, Berlin police managed to arrest the <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.de/20160726/man-gets-life-in-jail-for-murder-of-two-young-children\">murderer of two children</a> only after he had been caught on a shopkeeper\u2019s CCTV camera.</p> <p>Yet with two days to go until Berliners cast their votes, polls indicate that on issues around privacy and data protection, the German capital will preserve its unique status.</p> <p>Latest surveys have the Christian Democrats on a mere 17% of the vote, well behind mayor Michael M\u00fcller\u2019s Social Democrats. Some polls even put the CDU into third place, behind the Green party.</p> <p>After five years of a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d between the centre left and centre right, Berlin looks likely to be governed in the future by an alliance between the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Left party.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c565dc67373b16a8891eef887e6c443dc2c71fc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c565dc67373b16a8891eef887e6c443dc2c71fc9/0_0_3528_2568/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A surveillance camera next to a mirror reflecting people gathered outside the intelligence service HQ in Berlin.

The latest polls have the AfD as the fifth strongest party in the state parliament, behind four others with a broadly pro-refugee stance \u2013 a reminder, perhaps, that fears of rising rents still register higher than fears of terrorism in Berlin.</p> <p>On closer inspection, the Christian Democrats\u2019 crisis in the city looks like a reflection of the party\u2019s struggles nationally rather than the failure to engage with attitudes on interior security at a local level.</p> <p>Since the fall of the Berlin Wall authorities in the German capital have had to work with tighter restrictions on state surveillance than have affected other big cities internationally. While almost 15,000 CCTV cameras are installed at rail stations and on public transport, data privacy regulations stop the police from installing, in public spaces, cameras that transmit images in real time.</p> <p>The city\u2019s police union argues that such restrictions put its officers at a disadvantage compared with those in regions such as Bavaria, where they can set up mobile CCTV units. \u201cAt the moment, we are short of qualified staff and state-of-the-art kit, which means we are always one step behind the criminals\u201d, said Bodo Pfalzgraf, the union chief.</p> <p>In June, Henkel, then still the Berlin senate\u2019s interior minister, had tried to change local law to allow CCTV surveillance of crime hotspots such as Alexanderplatz and Kottbusser Tor in Kreuzberg. But the proposal failed partly because of a last-minute intervention by the Pirate party, which entered the state parliament in 2011 on a data protection agenda.</p> <p>The defeat left Henkel\u2019s conservatives with an issue to campaign on, but little evidence that they were up to the task of changing Berlin\u2019s cultural consensus around surveillance when they were in power.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5db02337836671f1eb4d29a2fed2943346abbb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5db02337836671f1eb4d29a2fed2943346abbb5/54_0_3044_4471/681.jpg\" alt=\"A man claiming to be a Syrian refugee holds up a sign that reads: \u2018I love Mrs Merkel, thank you for your help\u2019 at a CDU campaign rally in Berlin.\" width=\"681\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man claiming to be a Syrian refugee holds up a sign that reads: \u2018I love Mrs Merkel, thank you for your help\u2019 at a CDU campaign rally in Berlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

  "<p>Among my papers is a yellowing pamphlet calling on Britons to migrate to Australia. It is dated from the early 1960s and depicts a version of the happy life: in one photograph a nuclear family is playing on a beach, in another they are strolling down a suburban footpath. There is a photo of a wife doing the shopping and one of a well-dressed man going off to work, smiling and swinging his briefcase.</p> <p>The captions promise everlasting sunshine and a \u201cBritish way of life\u201d in a country populated by \u201cBritish stock\u201d \u2013 for only \u00a310 (about \u00a3150 today) with children travelling free. It was a seductive vision of the migrant\u2019s life and my grandfather fell for it. He was one of many: the Assisted Passage Scheme was one of the 20th century\u2019s largest planned migrations. Those who participated are commonly known as ten pound poms.</p> <p>My maternal grandparents migrated to Sydney in 1965, but it was not an easy decision, as far as the story of their marriage goes. It was something my grandfather wanted very much, and which my grandmother wanted not at all. This rift was complicated by their different backgrounds: my grandfather was part of the Anglo-Indian diaspora. Born in Calcutta in 1926, he was sent to England as a boy in the lead up to Indian independence but he never felt wholly at home here and the claim that Australia would be just like Britain, only sunnier, appealed.</p> <p>My grandmother, on the other hand, had never lived anywhere other than England and identified intensely with the landscape and its people. When they left, they had four young children, and my grandmother discovered she was pregnant with a fifth on the voyage. She did not want to move, and has resented this, to varying degrees, ever since.</p> <p>Growing up in Australia, what I heard again and again was my grandmother complaining about this ill-fated event. Her longing for England never lessened.</p> <p>I can\u2019t remember a time when I was in her company and she did not say something about the great pleasures and beauty of England and compare Australia unfavourably. Yet in our family it was part of our routine entertainment to quietly mock my grandmother\u2019s grief. All the while my grandfather silently bore her criticism, aware that his wife thought he had done her some great wrong. As a child, and young woman, I accepted the wider family\u2019s take: my grandmother was simply a whingeing pom.</p> <p>In my mid-20s I moved to the UK to undertake a PhD. Towards the end of my studies, my grandparents came to visit: they stayed nearby and I invited them for dinner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0bdeec5992ed0a8c38b866a2514199e03ed2af0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bdeec5992ed0a8c38b866a2514199e03ed2af0d/0_0_708_708/500.jpg\" alt=\"Stephanie Bishop\u2019s grandmother when she first moved to Australia.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephanie Bishop\u2019s grandmother when she first moved to Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Stephanie Bishop</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What surprised me most about that visit was the joy my grandmother seemed to feel simply by seeing me going about my days in England. It was as if by my moving here I had fulfilled something in my life that she couldn\u2019t achieve in her own. If she couldn\u2019t return, then at least I could. She spoke, that night, of England being my spiritual homeland because it was, so to speak, in the family. It was the first time we had really met alone, as two adults, and during the meal my grandmother confessed things that I didn\u2019t know of.</p> <p>She wondered why she had agreed to move to Australia when she hadn\u2019t wanted to. If it hadn\u2019t been for the children, she said, she might have left her husband. Until this point I\u2019d always viewed her as the archetypal stay-at-home mother: a strong feminist, but a feminism in which maternal experience stood at the apex of a woman\u2019s life. With this new knowledge \u2013 with the recognition of her own doubt and uncertainty \u2013 she seemed both more fierce and more injured.</p> <p>I started to understand the grief she had lived with for more than 40 years. This was partly because I, too, had come to feel attached to this place and could comprehend something of what she had lost. I then saw her in a completely different way: riven by opposing impulses, unsure of her own actions.</p> <p>I came to realise that my tendency to dismiss and overlook what, for my grandmother, amounted to an experience of exile, was part of a broader and persistent attitude towards this migrant group. The trials specific to British women migrants at that time were easily deemed insignificant. We generally resist describing migrants as exiles because it\u2019s assumed that the migrant is free to return. But after this conversation with my grandmother such a position seemed inaccurate, especially for this group of women, often with young children, and without independent means of their own that would allow them to choose otherwise.</p> <p>Not long after this visit, I discovered I was pregnant. Out of the blue, my husband and I found ourselves having conversations that seemed to replicate those my grandparents must have had 50 years before: where was the best place to raise a child? What experiences did we want our children to have? What did home mean to us, now that we\u2019d been away for so long?</p> <p>While we were trying to make a decision about our own lives, I began to feel that my experiences and my grandmother\u2019s were overlapping to an uncanny degree. It seemed as though my life were directly replicating that of my grandparents\u2019. And it was against my grandmother\u2019s life that, at the time, I often found myself trying to understand my own.</p> <p>While my mother thought I should come \u201chome\u201d to have the baby, my grandmother thought I should stay put. Even childbirth was better in England, she said. So I sided with her and we remained, our daughter born on a frosty night in December. Eventually, though, my husband and I returned to Australia with our child in tow. It was a decision that only further strengthened the strange overlap and subsequent bond between my grandmother and me.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Other Side of the World by Stephanie Bishop is published by Headline, \u00a38.99.

  "<p>Pie is joy guaranteed: the very definition of a simple pleasure. Pie \u2013 apple, with ice-cream \u2013 is what got <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Road\">Sal Paradise</a> clean across America and what makes a Thanksgiving spread to be thankful for. A half-time pie gets most Aston Villa fans through a painful match. And meat pies with tomato sauce are defining components not just of New Zealand and Aussie rugby fandom, but of basic national identity.</p> <p>As with anything so fundamental, variations on the traditional way of doing things do not go down well. To wit, the <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/archived/petitions/64629\">5,687 people who signed a petition last year</a> calling for anyone making a crustless pie to face criminal sanctions. But variations there are, from hand-raised hot-water crust specials to delicate puff-pastry pithiviers, lattice-topped fruit stews and Greek spanakopitas: the pie is about as old as eating itself. It\u2019s the proto-dish, a self-contained meal \u2013 as satisfyingly portable as pizza, but so much more hearty. And it should be hearty \u2013 a thin pie is either a misnomer for a tart or a baked disappointment. Frugality is not what you\u2019re going for here. And it isn\u2019t, judging by your efforts: you\u2019ve done justice to the width and breadth of everything a pie can be. Smiles all round.</p> <h2>The winning recipe: Garden pot pie</h2> <p><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/Bryony%20Bowie\"><em>Bryony Bowie</em></a>\u2019s old-fashioned treat was exactly what you want from a savoury pie: so savoury, in fact, that you don\u2019t even realise it\u2019s meatless. Rich but not heavy, filling but not dense; a meal for every day.</p> <p><strong>Serves 4-6</strong><br>1 onion, roughly chopped<br>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped<br>2 sticks celery, chopped<br>1 large leek, washed and chopped<br>2 carrots, peeled and chopped<br>2 potatoes (about 350g), peeled and roughly diced<br>A knob of butter <br>2 tsp dried thyme<br>50g plain flour<br>500ml vegetable stock<br>300ml single cream<br>1 tsp french mustard<br>1 bay leaf<br>\u00bd tsp grated nutmeg<br>400g tin of butterbeans, drained<br>50g curly kale, tough stems removed<br>10 fresh sage leaves, roughly chopped<br>320g pack ready-rolled puff pastry<br>1 egg, beaten</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Gently fry the onion, garlic, celery, leek, carrots and potatoes in a large pan with a knob of butter. Cook for 15 minutes, or until the veg is soft. Add the thyme and flour. Stir to coat and cook for a further 2 minutes.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Stir in the stock, cream, mustard, bay leaf, nutmeg and butter beans. Bring to the boil, then turn down to a simmer for 15 minutes, or until reduced. About 3-5 minutes before the end, add the kale and sage, and season to taste. Turn off the heat and allow to cool slightly before transferring to your pie dish.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Set the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Grease the rim of your filled pie dish, then cut a thin strip of pastry, about 2cm wide, and press it on to the edge. Brush with cold water and cover with the rest of the pastry. Trim away the excess, then crimp the edges. Cut two slits into the middle and brush with beaten egg. You can use the leftover pastry to make shapes: just remember to glaze these with egg, too.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Bake for 45 minutes, until the pastry is puffed up and golden. Serve with steamed green veg and salad.</p> <h2><strong>Homity pie</strong></h2> <p>I took one bite of <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/clairetweet\"><em>ClaireTweet</em></a>\u2019s pie, and it took every bit of willpower I had not to polish the whole thing off. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0a398aa0946f309ab3702aa5bdbf47a7781a00a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0a398aa0946f309ab3702aa5bdbf47a7781a00a/0_0_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Homity pie\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Just don\u2019t make it if you\u2019re on a diet,\u2019 says Claire Tweet.

Fit the dough into the dishes, pressing it gently into the almonds you\u2019ve already put at the bottom. Trim the dough around the edges of the dishes, but leave enough overhanging to cover the rice completely. Put the filling into the pastry and gently pull the edges of the dough over the filling.

Set aside to cool.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Blanch the sliced celeriac in lightly salted boiling water for 2-3 minutes. Drain and set aside.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to about 5\u20136mm thick. You will need to cut out 2 circles, one bigger than the other. I used plates to cut around. The pastry base had a diameter of 25cm and the pastry top was 29cm. Make the top at least 3cm larger so it covers the topping.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Lay the smaller pastry circle on a lined baking tray and prick several times with a fork.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Lay out some of the celeriac slices over the smaller circle. Make sure that you don\u2019t go all the way to the edge; leave a margin of at least 2cm (as this will form your pie edge). Add a little of the onion and garlic. Sprinkle over a few fresh thyme leaves and the crumbled blue cheese. Season with black pepper.</p> <p><strong>6</strong> Repeat the layers. Depending on how big your pastry base is, you may only get two complete layers in, or perhaps three.</p> <p><strong>7</strong> Brush the pastry margin with a little of the beaten egg.</p> <p><strong>8</strong> Lay the larger pastry circle over the top (trying to keep it centred). Press down on the edges with your fingers to seal the filling in. I cut out a tiny circle in the top, to allow steam to escape, but gently rested the cut-out pastry circle on its hole (as the pastry will expand when cooking).</p> <p><strong>9</strong> Brush with the beaten egg and set aside in the fridge for 20 minutes before baking. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until golden brown.</p> <h2><strong>Mojito key lime pie</strong></h2> <p>That settles it: <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/ColonialCravings\"><em>ColonialCravings</em></a> is a master with booze in the kitchen.

  "<p>Australia will seek out alternative free trade agreements in the region should the Trans-Pacific Partnership fail to pass a US Congress vote, the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, has said.</p> <p>Bishop made the comments while addressing reporters in Washington, where she has met representatives for US presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

I did not know the meaning of the word \u2018wog\u2019 and the first thing I did when I got home from school that day was to look up the word in my brother\u2019s dictionary. Incredulously, I read the definition over and over: \u2018Someone of dark skin who is foreign to the land on which he lives.\u2019 I was hurt more by the tone of the word and less by its definition. I felt ugly, scared and very alone,\u201d she said, immediately linking that experience to the current debate about hate speech.</p> <p>\u201cI am a passionate believer in free speech \u2026 (but) \u2018hate speech\u2019 is simply not part of Australia\u2019s moral code, regardless of our views \u2026 whilst this was just a primary school playground experience, it sowed the seeds for my belief that public figures, and those who have a big share of voice in the media and other forums, have a higher duty of care and responsibility to think before they write and speak. This is not \u2018political correctness gone mad\u2019; rather, that those who have this voice should apply the test of respect and responsibility, and ask themselves: how would that Australian child who is watching or reading this feel? I suspect the same way I felt that day at primary school.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5832debdc39f3cd9042962ba219a17c8470bd7f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5832debdc39f3cd9042962ba219a17c8470bd7f1/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Khalil is congratulated by Labor deputy leader Tanya Plibersek after giving his first speech in the House of Representatives.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Khalil is congratulated by Labor deputy leader Tanya Plibersek after giving his first speech in the House of Representatives.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few days earlier, Peter Khalil, the son of Egyptian migrants, who won the seat of Wills for Labor, had nailed his colours to the mast on the issue of asylum policy.</p> <p>\u201cI believe Australia has a moral obligation, at the minimum, to take responsibility for the care of those refugees that have been physically or emotionally damaged by the long-term detention that we have submitted them to,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI also think we should re-examine the assumed nexus between detention centres and discouraging people smugglers to ascertain how much this argument holds in the context of robust turn-back policies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/16/if-you-want-a-response-from-the-muslim-community-first-understand-it\">If you want a response from the Muslim community, first understand it | Mostafa Rachwani</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI supported our leader, Bill Shorten, when he made clear that if we won the election one of his first acts would be to negotiate with the UNHCR the resettlement of the refugees to safe and secure countries \u2026 But I recognise that even this falls far too short in our moral, legal and international obligations as a good international citizen.\u201d</p> <p>Julian Leeser, the new Liberal member of the New South Wales seat of Berowra gave a searing account of his father\u2019s suicide 20 years ago, including finding his final note \u201con the glass-topped table in the hall\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cLike so many of the notes from my father [it was] written in red pen on the back of a used envelope.

I just can\u2019t cope, love, John\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Leeser was open about his regrets at not noticing the signals his father had been giving and his view that despite many many programs and millions of dollars in spending, Australia is still failing in mental health services and suicide prevention.</p> <p>Susan Templeman, the new Labor member for Macquarie, described how, 10 years ago, her \u201cfamily\u2019s foundations were rocked\u201d by her daughter\u2019s first experience of mental illness, something that started Templeman on the path that led to this speech, watched by her family from the public gallery, including her daughter who was \u201cdetermined that her history is something not to be ashamed of\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI vividly remember a distressing night, standing in my kitchen with my husband, asking: how do other families do this?,\u201d Templeman recounted.</p> <p>\u201cAnd while I did not then and there declare my intention to run for parliament, that was the moment I look back on as transformative, when something in me shifted. It turned out we were not the only ones facing the same challenge. Having mental illness in a family makes you question your parenting and your values, and I have learned more from that experience than any other in my life \u2026 So that was how I became someone who did not just sit around solving the problems of the world at a dinner party, but an advocate and an activist \u2026 The funny thing about standing up on an issue is that once you start it is hard to stop. Injustice is injustice, no matter what form it takes.\u201d </p> <p>There was Mike Freelander, the new Labor member for Macarthur, describing his work as a doctor with children with developmental problems and illnesses and how it motivated him to fight inequality on healthcare.
