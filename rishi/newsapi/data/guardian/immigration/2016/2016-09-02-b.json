  "<p>Last seen battling two of the world\u2019s best teams and coming up short, this was a stress-free return to action for the United States, as they moved smoothly to the brink of the last round of the Concacaf qualifying tournament for the 2018 World Cup.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/sep/02/st-vincent-grenadines-usa-world-cup-qualifying-live\">St Vincent &amp; the Grenadines v USA: World Cup 2018 qualifying \u2013\u00a0as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Coming after June\u2019s humiliating 4-0 loss to Argentina in the semi-finals of the Copa America Centenario and the 1-0 defeat by Colombia in the third-place playoff, this Caribbean trip was the sporting equivalent of a relaxing beach holiday.</p> <p>The US were 3-0 up on St Vincent &amp; the Grenadines by half time and added another three goals after the break when Christian Pulisic and Sacha Kljestan came off the bench and combined to lethal effect.</p> <p>Jurgen Klinsmann\u2019s side drew level on points with Trinidad &amp; Tobago at the top of Group C, with one fixture to come \u2013 against T&amp;T on Tuesday in Jacksonville. T&amp;T were scheduled to face Guatemala later on Friday, with the Americans\u2019 passage to the decisive \u201cHex\u201d qualifying phase assured if Guatemala lose.</p> <p>The top two finishers in the three groups of four teams reach the \u201cHex\u201d, which starts in November and features six nations vying for one of three guaranteed tickets to Russia, plus the chance of a play-off against an Asian side.</p> <p>A 2-0 loss on the road to Guatemala in March had placed Klinsmann under pressure that mostly dissolved once the team met expectations by reaching the Copa semi-finals, even if there was a large dollop of wishful thinking from some quarters helping to nourish the rumours that the head coach might be offered the England job.</p> <p>If England\u2019s loss to Iceland at Euro 2016 was a reminder that organised and inspired minnows can sometimes gobble up bigger rivals, the shock factor of that result underlined the rarity of genuinely huge upsets in knockout tournaments, let alone mini-leagues. Italia \u201990 was the last World Cup not to feature both of the Concacaf region\u2019s two powers, the US and Mexico (who were banned).</p> <p>It was quickly obvious that this would not be a glorious day for the Vincy Heat, who knew before kick-off they would not be going to Russia after losing all four of their matches, scoring three goals and conceding 19. The island chain with a population of about 100,000 is ranked equal 156th in the world by Fifa; one of their greatest-ever players, Rodney Jack, was a fan favourite in England with Torquay United and Crewe Alexandra in the 1990s. Another, Ezra Hendrickson, won three MLS Cups over twelve years in the league and coaches Seattle Sounders\u2019 second team. When the sides met in St Louis last November, the US won, 6-1. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/sports/soccer/young-caribbean-team-braces-for-daunting-task-in-world-cup-qualifier.html?_r=0\">Many St Vincent players are part-timers</a>.</p> <p>Still, like a politician with a commanding lead in the polls before election day, Klinsmann\u2019s task is to project confidence and look to the future while encouraging a hint of doubt in order to avoid complacency.</p> <p>If there was any justification for approaching these opponents with caution, it was that the US were certainly under-strength: forwards Clint Dempsey and Gyasi Zardes, defender John Brooks and midfielder Jermaine Jones were unavailable through injury or health concerns, while captain Michael Bradley was suspended.<br>Klinsmann sounded a familiar refrain about the slow progress of America\u2019s youngsters <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.com/team/united-states/660/blog/post/2941814/jurgen-klinsmann-usmnt-q-and-a-on-2018-world-cup-prep-clint-dempsey-deandre-yedlin-and-more\">in a pre-match interview</a> with ESPN, and duly started only one inexperienced player: 21-year-old Kellyn Acosta of FC Dallas, typically deployed in midfield but here at left back, with Fabian Johnson pushing higher up the field. Kyle Beckerman, 34, and 30-year-old Graham Zusi began in midfield while Darlington Nagbe, Jordan Morris and Pulisic waited on the bench.</p> <p>Intriguingly, Klinsmann earlier revealed that Brad Guzan, his first choice at the Copa, would start this game but 37-year-old Tim Howard would slide between the posts for what should be a busier assignment on Tuesday. Matt Besler \u2013 whose wife gave birth to a daughter earlier in the day \u2013 started in defence.</p> <p>The home team\u2019s starting XI included Seattle Sounders\u2019 Oalex Anderson, who scored a memorable opening goal in last year\u2019s 6-1 loss. That was played in a baseball stadium; Friday\u2019s return took place at a cricket ground, with an afternoon kick-off because of the lack of floodlights and a darker shade of green in the centre circle indicating the usual location of the wicket.</p> <p>The Americans ought to have scored after only two minutes, but Bobby Wood, clean through, scuffed his left-footed shot and gave Lemus Christopher an easy save.</p> <p>St Vincent\u2019s most promising moment of the first half came after 26 minutes, but Anderson botched a header after sneaking beyond the US back line to connect with a floated free kick.</p> <p>A minute later, the US were ahead, Wood guiding the ball into the far corner from the edge of the area, continuing the strong form he has shown at Hamburg in recent weeks. A special day for Besler grew even better after 32 minutes when he coolly controlled a misplaced defensive header and steered in his first international goal from six yards. The baby-rocking celebration was inevitable.</p> <p>Jozy Altidore, back from injury and wearing the armband, made it 3-0 from the penalty spot a couple of minutes before half time after Roy Richards scythed down Wood with a reckless challenge and was lucky to escape with only a yellow card.</p> <p>St Vincent had the better of the early exchanges in the second period, and cruelly had two goals correctly ruled out for offside, but the Americans settled down and two substitutes combined to extend the advantage after 71 minutes.</p> <p>Kljestan set up Pulisic for an impressive finish as the 17-year-old controlled the pass and slotted the ball beyond the goalkeeper for his second US goal. Both had been on the field for only a couple of minutes.</p> <p>It was 5-0 a couple of minutes later when Pulisic surged down the left wing and crossed to give Kljestan a simple finish. In stoppage time the Borussia Dortmund teenager scored his second of the afternoon, set up by Kljestan and given ample space to pick his spot from 18 yards.</p> <p>The pair\u2019s swift and dramatic impact added interest to a half that had been listing aimlessly, making it hard not to wonder why they had not been introduced far earlier.

  "<p>Two very different women hold Europe\u2019s future in their hands \u2013 and neither of them is Theresa May. The battle for Europe\u2019s soul is being waged between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\" title=\"\">Marine Le Pen</a>. This is a clash of personalities and visions: Germany\u2019s chancellor v the leader of France\u2019s Front National, the largest far-right party in Europe. As Britain prepares to leave the EU, the Franco-German dimension of the continent\u2019s destiny has arguably never been so important since the end of the cold war. What is at stake is momentous: whether Europe can survive as a project, and whether fundamental principles such as the rule of law, democracy and tolerance can be salvaged. The battle will play out nationally in 2017, in key elections in France and Germany, but it concerns all Europeans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/13/front-national-fails-to-win-control-of-target-regions-amid-tactical-voting\">French elections: Front National makes no gains in final round</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It may seem strange to reduce Europe\u2019s existential crises to just one personal confrontation. Merkel has been in power <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/11/germany.topstories3\" title=\"\">since 2005</a> and is trying to remain there, while Le Pen may dream of being in office but has never approached it (last year her party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/13/front-national-fails-to-win-control-of-target-regions-amid-tactical-voting\" title=\"\">failed to take control</a> of a single French region in local elections). Some may ask: why would a French opposition figure count more than the man currently sitting in the Elys\u00e9e Palace? But Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has become so weak \u2013 even more so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/frances-economy-minister-emmanuel-macron-resigns\" title=\"\">with this week\u2019s resignation of his economics minister, Emmanuel Macron</a> \u2013 and terrorism has transformed French politics to such a degree that Le Pen\u2019s prospects now stand out as a key defining factor of where France, and Europe for that matter, may be heading.</p> <p>It is only partly reassuring to say that Le Pen has little chance of becoming president next year (the French electoral system makes that difficult). The trouble is, in recent months, her brand of anti-Muslim, xenophobic and nationalistic politics has spread across the French mainstream right like wildfire. Le Pen is fast capitalising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/26/burkini-ban-france-failed-minorities-muslim\" title=\"\">on this summer\u2019s burkini episode</a> and on the national trauma left by jihadi terrorism. It\u2019s hard to see which French politician or movement can find the authority and strength to push back against her ideas, or counter their appeal among the French suburban middle classes as well as in rural areas. Nicolas Sarkozy hopes to win primaries in November, but his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/burkini-row-nicolas-sarkozy-calls-for-nationwide-ban\" title=\"\">whole strategy hinges on imitating</a> rather than disputing Le Pen\u2019s line of thinking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24f95049d506e40dc3615a1de5205cae227c5a89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24f95049d506e40dc3615a1de5205cae227c5a89/0_60_3435_2061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Merkel and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Le Pen lashed out at Hollande, describing him as a subdued \u2018vice-chancellor of Germany\u2019, after he\u2019d denounced populism in a speech.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Wojazer/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marine Le Pen\u2019s single most powerful opponent is to be found outside France: Angela Merkel. Le Pen hates Merkel, and Merkel despises Le Pen. They confront each other in a fight of European proportions. Le Pen has often attacked the chancellor \u2013 once describing her as an \u201cempress\u201d imposing \u201cillegal immigration\u201d on the whole of Europe. Merkel sees Le Pen as an acute political threat to Europe, although she has rarely mentioned her in public. If France embraces the far right, the wider impact will be far more serious than it was with, say, Hungary\u2019s illiberal slide.</p> <p>Merkel and Le Pen have never met, nor have they had any reason to. Once, last year, they sat not far from each other in the European Parliament chamber \u2013 but Merkel kept her gaze away, out of contempt. That day, Le Pen furiously lashed out at Hollande, describing him as a subdued \u201cvice-chancellor of Germany\u201d, after he\u2019d denounced populism in a speech.</p> <p>These two women have one thing in common and one thing only: the depth of their political conviction. Angela Merkel has been unwavering in her message that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/17/refugees-did-not-bring-terrorism-to-germany-says-angela-merkel\" title=\"\">welcoming refugees is the right thing to do</a>; Le Pen fumes against \u201crampant Islamisation\u201d of the continent. Merkel wants to save the European project; Le Pen is fully aligned with forces that want to dismantle it (she recently said on CNN that France had become an EU \u201cprovince\u201d). Merkel nurtures the transatlantic link; Le Pen admires Putin\u2019s Russia \u2013 her party sits at the heart of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/08/russia-europe-right-putin-front-national-eu\" title=\"\">pro-Kremlin networks in Europe</a>, financial ones among them. Le Pen\u2019s ideology draws from France\u2019s historical far right, the ideas of Charles Maurras and colonial racism; Merkel is the daughter of a Protestant pastor for whom individual freedoms are paramount values. Le Pen has always made much about being divorced and smoking cigarettes (trying to cast herself in the image of a modern woman); Merkel\u2019s personal style is more subdued, which isn\u2019t to say her character is less ironclad.</p> <p>For decades what drove the European project was the so-called \u201cFranco-German engine\u201d. It is now all but broken \u2013 mainly because of France\u2019s economic weaknesses, which have severely unbalanced the relationship. What now drives European politics is a different kind of Franco-German equation, one in which Merkel, often faulted for her eurozone policies, has on several occasions attempted to give France\u2019s socialist government some financial breathing space against Le Pen \u2013 including by sparing France the wrath of the EU commission for disrespecting deficit targets.</p> <p>Merkel\u2019s anti-Le Pen strategy has largely been discreet. But in May she made it very plain. Speaking at Berlin\u2019s French lycee, she said she would try to make sure \u201cother political forces are stronger than the Front National, if that can be accomplished from abroad\u201d. It was an unusually blunt statement. Le Pen\u2019s supporters immediately <a href=\"http://europe.newsweek.com/marine-le-pen-angela-merkel-front-national-germany-455974?rm=eu\" title=\"\">accused the chancellor of meddling in French politics</a>; but Merkel has long identified the populist dynamics connecting Le Pen\u2019s rise with the rise of Germany\u2019s far-right <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/19/frauke-petry-acceptable-face-of-germany-new-right-interview\" title=\"\">AfD</a>, a party that threatens to upend politics in her own country.</p> <p>This coming Sunday, regional elections in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern offer a key test for Merkel\u2019s CDU party, which has trailed in local polls behind the AfD. Le Pen will be watching closely, and little wonder: one of the two will shape the future of Europe. The question is which.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/08/russia-europe-right-putin-front-national-eu\">We should beware Russia\u2019s links with Europe\u2019s right | Luke Harding</a> </p> </aside>",

The Mail has retracted the story, explaining that it was merely pointing out some things that someone else had said that weren\u2019t true. The blogger has taken down his posts; the $150m lawsuit remains. If they settle quickly, it might pay for some of Trump\u2019s election ads.</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly one way of shutting the idea down, though it may remind some that there was a dimension of sexual prurience to Hearst\u2019s furious campaign against Welles\u2019s movie. Rosebud was the name on the sledge that perhaps represented Kane\u2019s last moment of childhood innocence, but was also, as Gore Vidal later pointed out advisedly, Hearst\u2019s pet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/25/citizen-kane-rosebud\" title=\"\">nickname for the clitoris of his mistress, Marion Davies</a>.

I have very little interest in whether Melania Trump was or wasn\u2019t an escort. As the obvious joke goes, the far more damaging claim is that she is married to Donald Trump. I am interested, however, in the particular things that particularly enrage the Republican nominee in the US presidential election. I am interested in which untruths Trump will spout again and again, and I am interested in which untruths spouted by others he won\u2019t stomach. I am especially interested in why it might be that he will not stomach them.</p> <p>What is it about this allegation about his wife that Trump particularly dislikes? (And don\u2019t for a minute think this suit is something Melania would have been permitted to bring on her own.)

Consider his serial ogling of his daughter Ivanka, and repeated declarations that <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/donald-trump-wont-stop-joking-about-banging-his-daughter/\" title=\"\">he\u2019d have her if he wasn\u2019t her father</a>.

What matters is that he ended up with it, and it\u2019s what you do with the place that counts. He specified certain improvements. He demands that it be kept a certain way. He has made something special of it. He constantly brags about the way that it looks, reminding people that it is, above all else, a prestige acquisition.</p> <p>Indeed, he has deliberately opened it up to others, in the form of a country club. They are invited to feast their eyes on certain bits of it, though there are, of course, particular areas reserved just for him. There may be a right time to offload it in the future \u2013 even the most exquisitely upholstered things get tatty in the end. There\u2019s every chance that in 10 years\u2019 time a west coast newbuild would look more appealing.</p> <p>I suspect that what Trump really can\u2019t stand about the Melania escort stuff it is that it reduces him to a plot device in her story. It makes him her mark, in a way \u2013 the ticket for what he knows others will see as her gimlet-eyed journey out of Slovenia, all the way to the Trump Tower penthouse. If people were even allowed to think it might be true, just this one remove from Pennsylvania Avenue, then his entire tale would have to be constituted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/21/donald-trumps-lawyers-demand-art-of-the-deal-co-writer-pay-back-royalties\" title=\"\">The Art of the Deal</a> by Melania Trump.</p> <p>Ultimately, it is becoming notable how many of the most psychologically revealing things written about the Trumps have been either fictional or factually untrue.

Ford said: \u201cThis was because the book was written in 1993. In today\u2019s world, you would lock the doors in your car, call for help on your cellphone, and it would be done. So I had to move it to somewhere where theoretically there would be no cellphone service.</p> <p>\u201cAlso, I believe in that old line \u2018Write what you know\u2019, and west Texas is a place I know very well.

  "<p>We\u2019ve spent this summer making the most of the season\u2019s wonderful fruit \u2013 strawberries, apricots, nectarines, cherries, gooseberries \u2013 yet more fruit keeps arriving at the market. Most recently, that crop has included raspberries and loganberries from Scotland, which produces some of the best in the world: they\u2019re a great addition to pillows of sweetened, whipped ricotta in my easy version of peach melba.</p> <p>I have recently rediscovered the joys of raspberry vinegar, thanks mainly to <a href=\"http://snapsandrye.com\">Snaps &amp; Rye</a>, a fantastic Danish restaurant that\u2019s almost on my doorstep in west London. A decade or so ago, I ignored this vinegar altogether, thinking it just another fussy food fad or, worse, a hanger-on from nouvelle cuisine. How wrong I was: it adds a delicious sweet-sharpness to salad dressings, and has an elusive, barely-there scent of raspberries that goes beautifully with the flavour of plums.</p> <p>That combination is fantastic with slices of smoked duck, which you can buy in good delis;\u2019 if you\u2019re feeling more adventurous, the same dressing also works well with thin slices of fried duck or pigeon breast. It\u2019s a lovely combination of flavours that would be the perfect dish for the balmy evenings of an Indian summer. Well, we can live in hope.</p> <h2><strong>Smoked duck salad with kohlrabi and chilli plum relish</strong></h2> <p>Wafer-thin, crunchy slivers of kohlrabi bring a lovely crispness to this refreshing salad; if you can\u2019t get hold of kohlrabi, use radishes or celeriac instead. Serves four to six.</p> <p><strong>12 small semi-ripe round plums (or 8 Victoria plums)</strong><br><strong>4 tsp olive oil</strong><br><strong>1 tsp sugar</strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp sea salt flakes</strong><br><strong>\u00bd -1 tsp chilli flakes (or to taste)</strong><br><strong>1 kohlrabi</strong><br><strong>100g bull\u2019s blood salad leaves, lamb\u2019s lettuce or baby spinach</strong></p> <p><strong>200g smoked duck</strong><br>For the dressing<br><strong>1 tsp caster sugar</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp raspberry vinegar (or white balsamic)</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp pomegranate molasses</strong><br><strong>4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</strong><br><strong>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p> <p>Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Stone and quarter the plums, then put them in an oven dish and toss with the oil, sugar, salt and chilli flakes. Roast for 15 minutes, until completely soft \u2013 the plums should taste quite sharp (there is sweetness in the dressing to compensate) and have a kick of heat; if you prefer them a little less tart, by all means add a touch of honey. </p> <p>For the dressing, whisk the sugar and vinegar until the sugar has dissolved, then whisk in the pomegranate molasses and olive oil, and season to taste. </p> <p>Peel the kohlrabi and cut half into wafer-thin slices (use a mandoline, if you have one); chop the other half into fine matchsticks. In a bowl, toss the kohlrabi with the salad leaves and dressing, then tear the smoked duck into the salad. Serve with the spicy plums on the side or tossed through the salad.</p> <h2><strong>Peach melba with sweetened ricotta, amaretti and raspberries</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27c398288b05c15a9e222c661595a4beaa0c15dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27c398288b05c15a9e222c661595a4beaa0c15dc/0_93_1881_1129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers\u2019 peach melba with sweetened ricotta, amaretti and raspberries.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers\u2019 peach melba with sweetened ricotta, amaretti and raspberries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian.

Meanwhile, put 700ml of water into a wide saucepan and add the sugar, lemon juice, vanilla pod and bay. Bring to a boil, cook vigorously for five minutes, then turn down the heat so the syrup simmers gently.</p> <p>Halve and stone the peaches (if the stones don\u2019t want to come out, just leave them in until the peaches are cooked and soft, when they\u2019ll be easier to remove). Poach the peaches in the hot syrup for three to four minutes on each side, depending on their ripeness: you want the fruit to be soft and tender throughout, but not falling apart (if in doubt, test with a sharp knife). Remove the peaches from the syrup and peel them (or leave the skin on for a more rustic look, especially if it doesn\u2019t come away all that easily).</p> <p>Vigorously beat the drained ricotta with a wooden spoon, then whip in the sugar, lemon juice and zest.</p> <p>Serve two peach halves per plate, topping each with a dollop of sweet ricotta, a light sprinkling of crushed amaretti and a scattering of fresh raspberries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/05/lamb-burger-recipe-potato-pea-feta-salad-buttermilk-honey-apricot-cake-thomasina-miers\">The weekend cook: Thomasina Miers\u2019 healthy burger recipe</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>And for the rest of the week\u2026</strong></h2> <p>The plum relish is delicious with cheese, game and ham \u2013 I especially like it with a whole rolled gammon for Sunday lunch \u2013 so make double the amount and store in a sterilised jar in the fridge: it will keep for a good couple of weeks. And since you\u2019ve invested in a bottle of raspberry vinegar for the salad, you may as well experiment with it: as a pickling liquor, for example (it\u2019s very good for pickled plums), or try adding its acidic, fruity sparkle to Middle Eastern dishes \u2013 over roast figs, in tabbouleh salads and on exotically spiced, marinated lamb steaks. And make sure you keep the syrup left over from poaching the peaches \u2013 freeze it in small portions, and use in ice-creams, sorbets and cocktails: it will lend them a delicate hint of peachiness. Amaretti add a delicious backnote to roast pumpkin and sage (they\u2019re often crushed and added to stuffed pasta featuring those two ingredients); they also make a lovely, crunchy topping for a dark chocolate mousse.</p>",

I had dropped out of first year university a year earlier, due to family issues resulting in acute depression and anxiety. When I returned I felt odd being 'a year behind' and wondered if I was going to feel even lonelier than I had before I dropped out. Instead I met one friend in a radio class, and the other when my boyfriend came home and told me 'I just met someone at uni today who I think you might really like.' Within minutes of meeting each of them I felt as though I had met my soul mate. Twenty seven years later they are still my closest friends, their children are my godchildren and my son is their godchild.

Yep, it\u2019s a heavy question for a Friday afternoon, so Guardian Live shrewdly scheduled <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/utopia-2016-how-to-live-a-happy-life-26076096306\">their event on this elusive subject on Thursday evening</a> at Somerset House.</p> <p>Now then, there are a lot of answers to that question that might seem appropriate this week, such as \u201cdon\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2016/sep/02/morning-commute-on-southern-rail-live\">commute on Southern Trains</a>\u201d or \u201ctry not to end up as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/uzbekistan-uncertainty-death-dictator-islam-karimov\">president of Uzbekistan</a>.\u201d </p> <p>But as I met my fellow panellists Vanessa King, Ruth Whippman and Dawn Foster, it did occur to me that one way to lead a happy life might be to avoid being stuck in a stuffy basement room on a glorious evening in early autumn listening to writers talk about how to lead a happy life.</p> <p>Still, members, readers and general interlopers seemed, well, happy to be there. Whippman is amusing when describing the brutally earnest quest for happiness in America which paradoxically seems to be making everyone more miserable. King is good at the importance of emotional intelligence and self-knowledge. Foster chaired deftly with her customary deadpan delivery. <br></p> <p>Once Guardian members and readers got stuck in during the Q and A however, it quickly became apparent that happiness is like beauty \u2013 in the eye of the beholder. Different strokes etc. It\u2019s down to your parents, your freedom from psychological oppression, your upbringing, your emotional security, your self-esteem, your life choices, your talent fulfilment, the recognition of your intrinsic worth. Poverty can make you miserable, but money won\u2019t necessarily make you happy. </p> <p>So come on readers, get stuck in: what three qualities make for a happy life.

So that\u2019s what we did. It\u2019s left me wondering whether I did the right thing though.</p> <p>We played Pok\u00e9mon Go for a good couple of hours. We spent about an hour of that walking through a forest and by a lake, and we spotted ladybirds and holly bushes, and got some fresh air and exercise, and it was an outdoor activity. But we still spent a lot of of that time with our eyes glued to a screen.</p> <p>He\u2019s suddenly become absolutely obsessed with it. He knows all the names, he\u2019s constantly asking his mum to message me when I\u2019m at work to ask a question about a particular Pok\u00e9mon type, or to see if I\u2019ve caught any new ones. It\u2019s amazing the facts and figures their little minds can hoover up and memorise if they are really interested in something.</p> <p>But are games like that something a three-year-old should be playing? Should I have done something more traditional with him instead? If we\u2019d done the walk in the woods as an activity in its own right, I\u2019m not sure his attention on it would have lasted that long. </p> <p>His older sister, Emma, is six. She\u2019s already fantastically adept at using computers and typing, I think in part that is through having played games on smartphones and the iPad when she was younger. Those seem to me to be useful life skills to learn. But what do you think?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MartinBelam/status/771660885064421376\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;m not saying James is obsessed but... <a href=\"https://t.co/y8TkGuFZz5\">pic.twitter.com/y8TkGuFZz5</a></p>&mdash; Martin Belam (@MartinBelam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinBelam/status/771660885064421376\">September 2, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c97cdee4b0456abb93d648\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T13:21:58.276Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley voted joint leaders of Green party</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This news just broke - let us know what you think below the line.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/02/caroline-lucas-and-jonathan-bartley-voted-joint-leaders-of-green-party\">Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley voted joint leaders of Green party</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c94a11e4b09a68e9b64e73\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T12:51:26.429Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The Crystal Maze is set to make a come-back.

Here is Ryan\u2019s response:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think there\u2019s two threads here. Firstly, challenging the government who are creating policy and in turn, exacerbating the culture. Secondly, challenging the culture itself. That first one probably feels a particularly insurmountable challenge right now but focusing on tangible hope is key. We can oppose the policy by writing to targeted MPs and Lords when this stuff comes up (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/21/stephen-crabb-government-u-turns-disability-cuts-leaves-budget-disarray\">look at Personal Independence Payments</a>. It can work.)

Caroline Lucas and her co-leader Jonathan Bartley delivered their first leaders\u2019 speech in tandem - with one delivering one passage, before handing over to the other - and as a result it sounded a bit a school show and tell. The writing was strong, Lucas and Bartley are both confident speakers, but this format meant the speech never really built up any rhetorical momentum.</p> <p>That aside, and turning to the content, it was fine. It did not say anything particularly surprising, but Lucas and Bartley delivered a robust critique of the conduct of the EU referendum, and of inequality, and they presented a solid, progressive vision. There was relatively little environmentalism in it, but much more on the case for political reform, even if they were vague on what a progressive alliance with Labour might look like. The Greens seem quite serious about collaborating with Labour because, although Lucas and Bartley were damning about the Tories, they said virtually nothing critical of Labour, apart from Bartley\u2019s sharp opening joke - \u201cwe stand here, more united as party with two leaders than others are with one\u201d - which may well be the line from the speech most likely to be remembered.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c9823be4b0c2a396c0698c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T13:45:23.478Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Lucas is now winding up.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conference, it\u2019s been said that \u201cWe write history with our feet and with our presence and our collective voice and vision\u201d.</p> <p>We write history by resisting the climate crisis.

Like most small parties the Greens are very strong supporters of proportional representation (for obvious reasons - it took more than 1m votes to elect just one Green MP) . But there is no prospect of PR for Westminster arriving anytime soon and so currently there is an active debate in the party about how the Greens could cooperate electorally with Labour and other parties on the left. <strong>Caroline Lucas </strong>and Jonathan Bartley have made this an issue in their leadership campaign (their slogan is \u201cthe power of working together\u201d) and Lucas is the joint editor, with the Labour MP <strong>Nisa Nandy</strong> and the Lib Dem activist <strong>Chris Bowers</strong> of a new book called <a href=\"https://www.bitebackpublishing.com/books/the-alternative\">The Alternative: Towards a New Progressive Politics</a> which features essays about how progressive politicians from different parties might work together.</p> <p>There are various ideas floating around about how Labour and the Greens could work together. Here are four options.</p> <p><strong><em>1 - A proper pact - or an alliance called Plaform</em></strong></p> <p>The new book, The Alternative, does not make any firm proposals for Labour/Green cooperation. But in their conclusion Lucas and her co-authors quote at length a proposal from the Guardian journalist <strong>Stephen Moss</strong>, who wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/12/could-you-build-new-part-of-the-left-labour-jeremy-corbyn\">a long feature last summer looking at the possibility of building a new party of the left. </a>He floated the idea of an alliance called Platform, featuring four partners: a socialist Labour, a social democrat Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens. He suggested they could agree a set of common values and policies, and then in any seat put up the candidate (ie, Socialist Platform) most likely to win. The others could stand aside, or just put up paper candidates.</p> <p><strong><em>2 - A progressive kitemark</em></strong></p> <p>Lucas, Nandy and Bowers also float another idea in The Alternative - a progressive kitemark. They write:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Another [idea] might be for the progressives to establish a \u2018progressive kite mark\u2019 to which candidates at the 2020 election (and even earlier elections) could sign up to demonstrate to their electorate a commitment to a core set of priorities, which would include red lines for all the parties involved. This kind of pre-election identification could also help to prepare the ground for post-election cooperation without any formal agreement needing to happen before the election.</p> </blockquote> <p>Interestingly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/liberals-celebrities-and-eu-supporters-set-up-progressive-movement\">Paddy Ashdown, the former Lib Dem leader, is currently promoting a similar idea. </a></p> <p><strong><em>3 - Informal \u201cnon-compete\u201d agreement</em></strong></p> <p>The most basic form of cooperation involves parties coming to an understanding, privately, they they won\u2019t try very hard in each other\u2019s target seats at an election. Labour and the Lib Dems operated on this basis in 1997.</p> <p><strong><em>4 - Formal \u201cnon-compete\u201d agreements in certain areas</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Adam Ramsay,</strong> the Open Democracy co-editor and Green activist, floated this <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/adam-ramsay/green-party-should-help-build-progressive-alliance\">in an article on the case for a progressive alliance earlier this summer.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the nature of an electoral pact, there is a spectrum of options ... My preference is something in the middle.</p> <p>Specifically, political activist and electoral statistics geek Elliot Folan <a href=\"https://opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/elliot-folan/what-would-labour-green-electoral-pact-actually-look-like\">conveniently outlined</a> what such a deal might look like a number of months ago. They highlighted a list of seats in which it might be sensible for Labour to stand down for the Greens and vice versa, without going the whole hog and withdrawing candidates en mass. How many each party stood aside in would have to be the result of a tricky negotiation between respective central and national parties, and I think Greens should be willing to ask for quite a lot: after all, it would be Labour who would get to be in government. Ultimately, for Greens, such a deal could offer a serious chance to elect two or three more MPs. Let\u2019s be honest: that\u2019s unlikely otherwise.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is, though, one rather significant problem with all these proposals, and that is that the Labour leadership has shown very little interest in any form of alliance with the Greens.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/26/caroline-lucas-labour-jeremy-corbyn-progressive-alliance-green-party\">Lucas said last month that her office had been told by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office that he had \u201cnot shut the door\u201d on the idea of talking about a cross-party electoral alliance.</a> But Corbyn himself has said during the Labour leadership contest that he does not favour a progressive alliance. At one hustings meeting he said that Labour was \u201cdifferent from any other party\u201d and growing very quickly on its own. He may like Lucas personally (many Labour MPs do) but, with Labour currently hoovering up the Greens\u2019 voters, he has little incentive to form some pact with them.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T12:23:06.260Z\">at 1.23pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c83da4e4b00c28eaea75f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T11:02:03.424Z\">12.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There has been some controversy about Caroline Lucas\u2019s decision to stand again for the leadership. This is what <strong>Matt Townsend</strong>, a Green activist, wrote in <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/matt-townsend/green-party-leadership-election-stitch-up\">an article for Open Democracy in June.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The announcement by Caroline about returning as leader, I believe, has meant that most who were considering running campaigns now won\u2019t put their name forward. I am sure there will be some competition, but the general expectation is of a coronation rather than a real contest. Caroline is the Green Party\u2019s only national household name politician. Unless something amazing happens, there is a risk the contest has already been killed off ...</p> <p>[Bartley] is relatively unknown within the Green Party outside London. By being on a joint ticket with Caroline, he could become a co-leader of the party without any mandate of his own. He could ride in to the role on her coattails instead of earning his place through an open and fair contest which would have enabled him to become better known, test how the party feels about him and build up his profile ...</p> <p> It\u2019s easy to see how the Lucas-Bartley campaign can be justified. Two experienced media-savvy politicians, based in London and the South East, working together, for the good of the party \u2013 the end justifies the means. But does it really? Or maybe this kind of top-down decision-making by a party establishment just removes opportunities and ends fairness.</p> </blockquote> <p>In <a href=\"http://leftfootforward.org/2016/06/green-party-leadership-race-doesnt-need-to-be-a-coronation/\">a Left Foot Forward article in June </a><strong>Josiah Mortimer</strong> acknowledged that some members were unhappy about Lucas standing on a joint ticket with Bartley, but he defended their decision to put themselves forward.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Greens haven\u2019t done co-leadership since scrapping principal speakers around 2008. It\u2019s an exciting democratic model that\u2019s worth drawing the best elements from \u2013 and it\u2019s clear that the two candidates\u2019 qualities complement each other: Caroline \u2013 high profile, Jon \u2013 highly organised.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c958d1e4b00c28eaea77bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T10:48:06.340Z\">11.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from <strong>Archie Thomas</strong>, the Green party\u2019s press manager.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Archie_Thomas/status/771635846743101440\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1,200 due to attend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GPConf?src=hash\">#GPConf</a> in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Birmingham?src=hash\">#Birmingham</a> - approx. 40% are first-timers.</p>&mdash; Archie Thomas (@Archie_Thomas) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Archie_Thomas/status/771635846743101440\">September 2, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c9572be4b09a68e9b64eaa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T10:46:46.117Z\">11.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Peter and I have arrived at the conference.

There is a full list of the party posts and candidates<a href=\"https://www.greenparty.org.uk/internal-elections/candidates.html\"> here.</a></p> <p>And here are short profiles of the leadership election candidates.</p> <h2>Jonathan Bartley and Caroline Lucas (job share)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7120ff003a060d8c0ffcd0fb37bae7927cdac3b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7120ff003a060d8c0ffcd0fb37bae7927cdac3b0/462_437_3951_2370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For many people Lucas is the Green party. A former MEP, and the only Green MP (she has represented Brighton Pavilion since 2010), she led the party from 2008 until 2012 and, even after she stepped down (she said she wanted others in the party to have a chance to raise their profile), she found it hard not to overshadow her successor, Natalie Bennett. An excellent media performer and accomplished parliamentarian, she is one of the few people in the party one could easily imagine serving in cabinet.</p> <p>Bartley, from Lambeth in south London, is the party\u2019s work and pensions spokesman. A former researcher for the Conservative party in the 1990s, he is the founder of a Christian thinktank, Ekklesia, and he has been active in the Green party for some years, standing as a candidate in London elections. He has a disabled son (and achieved prominence in the 2010 general election when he challenged David Cameron on camera over Tory policies on inclusive education) and he cites being a parent as one reason why he is applying for the leadership as a job share.</p> <p>Lucas and Bartely want to form a new \u201cprogressive alliance\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/31/caroline-lucas-stand-green-party-leadership-job-share\">Lucas told the Guardian earlier this summer: </a>\u201cI really think there is an appetite out there now for a less tribal politics ... There is a sense, which we felt very strongly with the job share idea itself, that more ideas, the more plural your politics, the more likely they will be effective, and reach more people\u201d.</p> <p>The Lucas/Bartley website is <a href=\"http://www.bartleylucas.com/\">here.</a></p> <h2>Clive Lord</h2> <p>Clive Lord is virtually a founder member of the Green party, having joined in March 1973, five months after it was set up. Aged 81 (although \u201cremarkably fit for my age\u201d, he says in his election statement), he says he is only standing because his preferred candidate, Andrew Cooper, did not put himself forward. Cooper is standing for the deputy leadership and Lord says that, if elected, he would hope Cooper could do much of the work.</p> <p>Lord wants the Green party to get back to focusing on how to save the planet. Sustainability requires \u201cde-growth\u201d, he argues. He says he once proposed \u201ca recession can be fun\u201d as a slogan, but that fortunately \u201cwiser (?) counsels prevailed\u201d.</p> <p>Here is<a href=\"https://clivelord.wordpress.com/2016/06/23/my-leadership-bid-latest/\"> Lord\u2019s website.</a></p> <h2>David Malone</h2> <p>Malone is a filmmaker who makes documentaries for the BBC and Channel 4 and who also writes about finance and economics. He published a book about the financial crash,<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Debt-Generation-David-Malone/dp/0956690203\"> The Debt Generation</a>, and his pitch for the leadership is that the party should focus more on economics. \u201cIt seems to me that one of the defining facts of our times is that around the world the established political parties have surrendered to the idea that economics and finance no longer need to be under democratic control,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is wrong and dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Here is Malone\u2019s<a href=\"http://www.golemxiv.co.uk/\"> website.</a><br></p> <h2>Martie Warin</h2> <p>Aged 27, Warin is the youngest candidate. A musician and parish councillor from County Durham, he describes himself as an ecosocialist and says \u201csocialism is the philosophy of caring, capitalism, the philosophy of the greedy, ecosocialism is the philosophy of caring for the future\u201d. A member of the GMB, he also says that <a href=\"https://thenorwichradical.com/2016/07/30/our-greens-in-the-north/\">\u201cit is about time the Green party tried harder to forge robust alliances with trade unions,</a> as the values that we hold dear and the values of the trade unions go hand in hand.\u201d</p> <h2>Simon Cross</h2> <p>A Green party campaigner for many years, and a general election candidate in Rochford and Southend East in 2015, Cross has said that he wants the party to \u201crehabilitate progressive taxation\u201d and that this requires two things: \u201craising taxes fairly and explaining them honestly\u201d.</p> <h2><br></h2> <h2>David Williams</h2> <p>Williams spent 20 years as a Labour councillor and stood for parliament for the party three times. But he left the party in 2003, \u201cnot simply because they had launched the Iraq war but because they had adopted the philosophy and policies of Thatcherism\u201d. Since then he has been leader of the Green group on Oxford city council and he is currently leader of the Green group on Oxfordshire county council.</p> <p>He says that he is a great supporter of Lucas, but that he is standing because he does not want to see the party have a \u201ccoronation\u201d. He says the Greens are \u201ca political party not an environmental pressure group\u201d and that, if elected leader, he would tour the country building up the party.</p> <p>Here is William\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.david-williams-greenleader.co.uk/why-i-m-standing-.html\">website.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c837f5e4b09a68e9b64cbb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T08:43:31.949Z\">9.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the defining stories in British politics since 2010 has been the rise of insurgency parties. Ukip went from a party attracting under 1m votes (3.1%) in the general election six years ago to one getting 3.9m votes (12.6%) in 2015. The SNP transformed itself from a party that was seen as lucky to form a minority administration in Edinburgh to one that is now the unchallenged party of government in Scotland, with almost all the countries\u2019 MPs. And, in a less dramatic way, the same trended boosted the Greens. In 2010 they got just 286,000 votes (1%). Last year they were up to 1.2m (3.8%.) and their leader, Natalie Bennett, achieved prominence because she was included in the TV debates.</p> <p>But since then the Green party has collided with an obstacle - called Jeremy Corbyn. Corbyn\u2019s purist, anti-capitalist, green-tinged radicalism overlaps to a considerable degree with the Green party\u2019s policy platform. It is not just that Corbyn has an allotment; at the general election <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/18/green-party-citizens-income-natalie-bennett-benefit\">the Greens\u2019 flagship policy proposal was for a citizen\u2019s income </a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/05/john-mcdonnell-labour-universal-basic-income-welfare-benefits-compass-report\">Corbyn and his team are now actively considering whether Labour should adopt the idea. </a>As a result the Greens start their autumn conference today in Birmingham facing the challenge of how to compete or coexist with a Corbynite Labour party that seems to be stealing their USP.</p> <p>They also have to choose a new leader, although in truth they have already done so because the voting is over. The result will be announced at 2pm. Caroline Lucas, the former leader and only Green MP, is standing along with Jonathan Bartley as a job share and, although there are five other candidates, Lucas and Bartley are the overwhelming favourites to be elected. Almost 15,000 members votes in the contest (a turnout of 34%) but it is hard to avoid the suspicion that this is only the second most important leadership election for Green party voters this summer. After last year\u2019s Labour leadership election <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/09/15/anatomy-corbyns-victory/\">a YouGov analysis concluded that 40,000 of those voting in the contest were people who had voted Green in 2015. </a>Overwhelmingly they were voting for Corbyn. It is likely that this year there are more Green voters from 2015 taking party in Labour\u2019s leadership contest than in the Greens\u2019.</p> <p>I\u2019m on a Virgin train to Birmingham at the moment (with a seat) and I will be covering the opening of the conference, as well as any other Green-related developments. After the results of the leadership election are announced, the new leaders, or leaders, will address the conference. There will also be a debate about the universal basic income proposal.</p> <p>If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> <p>I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all.

Anything that good for you might be expected to smell foul and come in a medicine bottle, but the Mediterranean diet is generally considered to be delicious, except by those who hate olive oil. </p> <p>It is a potential answer to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/09/obesitys-global-spread-un-goals-diet-related-diseases-fail\">obesity crisis crippling healthcare systems</a>, but few understand exactly what the diet is and most of us do not follow it, including increasing numbers of people who live in the Mediterranean. The scientist Ancel Keys and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/dec/08/elizabeth-david-first-lady-of-food\">cookery writer Elizabeth David</a>, two of the pioneers who helped open the eyes of northern Europeans to the wonders of the Mediterranean diet, must be turning in their graves.</p> <p>We are constantly presented with paeans to the Mediterranean way of life and were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/29/mediterranean-diet-better-than-statins-for-tackling-heart-disease-study\">faced with yet another</a> this week, when a study presented at a heart disease conference in Rome claimed that those who ate a diet rich in vegetables, nuts, fish and oils were 37% less likely to die early than those who ate red meat and butter.</p> <p>But ask anybody what the Mediterranean diet actually is and few will give you the same answer. It is not a weight-loss regime such as the Atkins or Dukan diets. It is actually not a prescriptive diet at all, rather a pattern of eating. In spite of the name, it has less and less in common with the way that many people in southern Europe live and eat today.</p> <p>In the Greek tavernas, thronged with British holidaymakers in the summer months, the Mediterranean diet so highly regarded by health experts can turn into a lamb kebab with rice and chips, washed down with lager. Pasta, which has historically been a smaller <em>primi</em> (first) dish, overflows the enormous bowls in which it is served in many Italian restaurants. The French have finally lost the battle against the Big Mac.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5ca44b85213cc1257688a7e216402666b12d1e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5ca44b85213cc1257688a7e216402666b12d1e9/0_827_4957_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A plate of grilled octopus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"516\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seafood, including octopus, is a component of the traditional Mediterranean diet, but consumption varied according to location.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Mediterranean diet is based on a rural life where people ate what they grew, which is fast disappearing. The UN has recognised the diet as an endangered species. In 2013, Unesco <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/mediterranean-diet-00884\">listed the Mediterranean diet</a> as part of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity in Cyprus, Croatia, Spain, Greece, Italy, Morocco and Portugal.</p> <p>Even health experts and nutritionists differ on the detail of the Mediterranean diet, but the principles are fairly clear. It is about an eating style based on large amounts of fruit and vegetables, legumes such as beans, lentils, peas and peanuts, whole grains and especially olive oil. </p> <p>Fish and seafood are part of it, but their consumption varied in the past according to how close people lived to the sea. Chicken, eggs and small amounts of dairy, such as cheese and yoghurt, are there in moderation, but red meat and sweets would rarely be consumed. The diet includes a small amount of wine with meals. Pasta, bread and potatoes are variables from one region to another. It is quite a high-carbohydrate diet, which was fine when people were physically active on farms or fishing boats.</p> <p>Notably, none of this comes in a box. The supermarket spaghetti bolognese does not count. The Mediterranean diet has no preservatives. It is freshly picked, plucked and cooked. </p> <p>The use of olive oil is interesting, according to Tom Sanders, an emeritus professor of nutrition and dietetics at King\u2019s College London, who has carried out studies involving Mediterranean diets. \u201cIf you are trying to get people to eat a lot of vegetables and salad, it\u2019s quite difficult to do without oil,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if you are putting oil on top of salad, it also has a bit of a satiating effect. Aubergines or tomatoes in oil \u2013 you can have enough of that quite quickly. Whereas something that you\u2019ve got saturated fat in, such as cake or biscuits, it\u2019s easy to knock them back and you don\u2019t realise how much is going in.\u201d</p> <p>But there is more to the Mediterranean diet than the food on the plate. Unesco waxes wistfully lyrical on a whole idealised lifestyle that may appear to have little to do with the modern Mediterranean as we know it. \u201cThe Mediterranean diet involves a set of skills, knowledge, rituals, symbols and traditions concerning crops, harvesting, fishing, animal husbandry, conservation, processing, cooking and particularly the sharing and consumption of food. </p> <p>\u201cEating together is the foundation of the cultural identity and continuity of communities throughout the Mediterranean basin. It is a moment of social exchange and communication, an affirmation and renewal of family, group or community identity,\u201d the citation says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"454c83f32c356fedf58337d178b99ec4a36e282b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/454c83f32c356fedf58337d178b99ec4a36e282b/0_183_5504_3302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fresh produce at a street market stall in Naples, Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fresh produce at a street market stall in Naples, Italy. The key element of the diet is eating a large amount of vegetables.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe Mediterranean diet emphasises values of hospitality, neighbourliness, intercultural dialogue and creativity, and a way of life guided by respect for diversity.\u201d</p> <p>Shared family meals, it is now widely understood, help people eat well and avoid excess, while the TV dinner habit is linked to obesity.</p> <p>Keys, a Minnesota academic, started to investigate the health benefits of Mediterranean eating in the 1950s, after a visit to Naples. He was concerned about the large numbers of men dying from heart attacks in the US. An Italian colleague had told him that the heart attack rate among labourers in the Neapolitan area was low. It led to <a href=\"http://www.sevencountriesstudy.com/home/\">the Seven Countries Study</a>, an enormous project that continues today. The first pilot studies were set up in Nicotera, a village in Calabria, southern Italy, and in six villages on Crete.</p> <p>The study compared middle-aged men with different lifestyles and diet: on the US railroads, in the villages of North Karelia, Finland, where many men died as a result of heart disease, in the Netherlands, in Italian villages, but also workers on the railroads in Rome, in Crete and Corfu, in villages in Croatia, and in farming and fishing communities in Japan. </p> <p>It uncovered a link between eating high levels of saturated fat, found in red meat and dairy products, and cholesterol in the blood, and heart disease. The scientists could not prove that saturated fats were the cause, but the finger of suspicion was firmly pointed, leading to changed dietary guidelines in the US and the eventual craze for low-fat everything, with the resulting rise and rise of sugar to make processed food and drinks taste better. Keys has more recently been heavily criticised for opposing John Yudkin, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/07/the-sugar-conspiracy-robert-lustig-john-yudkin\">argued in the 1970s</a> that sugar, not fat, was the problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e58de0610f1556e4740d4908e9cd2e236eff8e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e58de0610f1556e4740d4908e9cd2e236eff8e9/0_215_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mediterranean food is served\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nowadays, Mediterranean food is often served with chips, while in Italy, pasta has gone from being a small first course to a larger main course.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What did not happen as a result of the study was the wholescale adoption of the Mediterranean diet, although Keys, who died aged 100 in 2004, promoted it in popular books and practised what he preached. </p> <p>David, a debutante, adventurer and lover of the Mediterranean sunshine, had an influence with her articles and books, describing dishes with aubergines, courgettes and other exotica that were all but unavailable in northern Europe in the 1950s and 60s. But the era of convenience food and the sheer quantity that became available, whether in supermarkets or from takeaways, had a greater impact on working populations.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Sanders says northern Europe is generally healthier than the Mediterranean regions. Things have changed.</p> <p>\u201cThat sort of diet was accompanied by quite a lot of physical activity. There were moderate intakes of wine, but it wasn\u2019t huge: it was about 300ml or 400ml at most a day. And these guys, particularly in Crete, which was looked at, were pretty active and were quite thin. </p> <p>\u201cIf you look at a follow-up of their kids, the second generation in the Seven Countries Study, they tend to be overweight and eating something quite different \u2013 a lot more deep fried food. The equivalent of Colonel Sanders really. And what you are seeing in southern Europe, Greece, is one of the highest increases in rates of cardiovascular disease, so there\u2019s been a switchover.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc757b241706f90381fca5e0627239fd522a4eb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc757b241706f90381fca5e0627239fd522a4eb1/303_0_4432_2659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Obesity in on the rise in Greece.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obesity is increasing in Greece, which topped the OECD childhood obesity league in 2014, ahead of the US, Italy and Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf we look at life expectancy, I think it\u2019s longest in Iceland.

Both countries had higher rates than the US and Mexico.</p> <p>Studies continue to show the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet. In June, the <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(16)30085-7/abstract\">respected Predimed study</a> in Spain found that overweight and obese people, with heart disease and diabetes, who ate a Mediterranean-style diet high in vegetable fat, because of additional olive oil or nuts, did not gain weight, compared with people on a low-fat diet.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the Mediterranean diet is good for you. But shifting the habits of nations to adopt, cook and eat it regularly in societies dominated by packaged food manufacturers is quite a task.</p>",
  "<p>We live in a mad, mad world. If you don\u2019t believe me, just watch the news tonight to see the full gamut of insanity on display. From low tragedy to high farce, politics, economics and celebrity culture all seem to be locked in a downward spiral of lunatic proportions. It\u2019s enough to drive a poet to despair.</p> <p>Mind you, this is no new thing. In the 18th century, a poet like Christopher Smart could be driven to the asylum by virtue of religious experiences that were at odds with the dictates of the rational fashion of the time. His contemporaries considered that, by virtue of their resistance to reason, the insane were a danger to society and should be held in isolation \u2013 so it was with Smart. During the six years he spent in mental health asylums, he wrote most of his very best poetry, including the wonderful <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/45173\">Jubilate Agno</a>, which sees the poet turn inwards for his inspiration, ignoring the bedlam of his surroundings and making poetry of Orphic power.</p> <p>Allen Ginsberg\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/49303\">Howl</a> famously begins: \u201cI saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness\u201d and was dedicated to Carl Solomon, a writer Ginsberg met and befriended in a mental asylum. In the litany that opens the poem, these \u201cbest minds\u201d are the outsiders, those that society considers mentally ill (echoing Smart\u2019s experience), but who for the poet represent the vital creative force in America. It\u2019s not the people who are mad \u2013 it\u2019s the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0623d1e51f2f116e2534cd0c63a111ea9fa1898\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0623d1e51f2f116e2534cd0c63a111ea9fa1898/0_231_1805_1083/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The pure products of America / Go crazy,\u2019 wrote William Carlos Williams.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pure products of America / Go crazy,\u2019 wrote William Carlos Williams.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lisa Larsen/Time &amp; Life Pictures/Getty Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Writing 30 years before Howl, Ginsberg\u2019s mentor William Carlos Williams reached a similar conclusion in <a href=\"http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/to-elsie.html\">To Elsie</a>, a poem that opens: \u201cThe pure products of America / Go crazy\u201d. However, Williams\u2019s outsiders are not the artists and dreamers that Ginsberg celebrates but \u201cordinary\u201d Americans \u2013 the rootless who lack a sustaining culture and hold cheap aspirations. It is these factors that drive them mad, their displaced materialism the root of their illness.</p> <p>Unlike Ginsberg, Williams\u2019s experience of mental illness was very much second hand. Other poets had a much more direct involvement to draw on in their work. One such was Anne Sexton, who had serious depression for most of her life.

But she is not content to be a victim of her condition and prefers to question it, to try to understand what she is going through.</p> <p>Rosemary Tonks\u2019s mental and physical health problems ultimately let her to abandon literature for fundamentalist Christianity and a life of isolation. In <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/57641\">The Sofas, Fogs, and Cinemas</a>, she shows early signs of that disillusionment and captures beautifully what used to be called \u201cnerves\u201d, the result of extreme sensory overload:</p> <blockquote> <p>I have lived it, and I know too much.<br>My caf\u00e9-nerves are breaking me<br>With black, exhausting information.</p> </blockquote> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/detail/55634\">Northumberland House</a>, Stevie Smith\u2019s chance encounter with a nice old lady on a bus becomes a study in difference; the sensitive child, withdrawn, just a bit too good, becomes the confused resident of a mental hospital in old age. Smith adds to the confusion by conflating the 19th-century institution with the Jacobean London home of the Percy family, which also went by the name Northumberland House. You can\u2019t help but wonder if she knew that the hospital\u2019s most famous patient was TS Eliot\u2019s first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood.</p> <p>I am also tempted to believe that Smith would have agreed with Emily Dickinson\u2019s sentiments in <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/51612\">Much Madness is Divinest Sense</a>. Dickinson points out that so much of what we consider normal is quite mad, and vice versa. The difference between the two is just a social construct, the consensus opinion of our society. This, in turn, may explain why it is we agree to live in a world gone mad; we simply fail to realise it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/17/poetry-human-therapy-mental-health\">Poetry expresses what it is to be human \u2013 it\u2019s therapy for the soul | Adam O\u2019Riordan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And so, this month you are invited to contribute poems on the subject of madness in all its guises.

  "<p>The mere mention of freshers\u2019 week can arouse that odd mix of stomach-churning dread and euphoric anticipation. Common perceptions about it include the idea that crates of beer are essential to proceedings, and that all new students are required to unleash their inner superhero or wonder woman during a series of fancy\u2011dress events.</p> <p>London student Peter Robertson certainly believed so. He bought a full Ninja Turtle outfit for a party, although he now regrets his rash purchase: \u201cIt was so hot, I could barely move, especially when I was trying to dance. Nobody had any idea what I looked like, but maybe that was a good thing!\u201d</p> <p>But freshers\u2019 week is certainly not just a booze fest. Even the name is a slight misnomer, as it can last anything from three days to two weeks. And, surprising as it may sound, not every student drinks. Some students are even shy.</p> <p>The University of Bath students\u2019 union president-elect, Lucy Woodcock, says: \u201cFreshers\u2019 week is simple \u2013 we bring together every new student to begin their shared experiences. There are hundreds of different events on offer, from sportsclub tasters to open-mic nights, inflatable challenges and headline events \u2013 so there is something for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>She reassures the more abstemious students: \u201cDrinking alcohol is an incredibly small part of the week. Freshers\u2019 week can be a scary and daunting time for new students and we have more than 400 returning students on board to help support and guide them through the week.\u201d</p> <p>Annie Bell, from Bristol\u2019s student union agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s a myth that everyone goes out every night of welcome week. Plenty of students go out only once, or not at all. No matter how confident everyone else seems, they\u2019re nervous too. Try to ask people you meet what course they\u2019re on, where they\u2019re from, or what A-levels they did. You might be sick of these questions by the end of the week, but they work as ice-breakers.\u201d</p> <p>The opportunity to settle in by trying new things and meeting new friends is the most important part of the week. Aston University has a meet and greet session for all international students and allocates an \u201cAston Auntie\u201d to look after its freshers. New recruits are shown the campus by old hands before being escorted around the sights of Birmingham. </p> <p>According to the university\u2019s student president, Ahmed Hassan, the more friends you make, the better fun you\u2019ll have: \u201cGetting outside the bubble of your own flat and meeting lots of other people makes the whole experience richer.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>I was really nervous before freshers\u2019 week as I was moving a long way from Southampton, but keen to get stuck in. After Mum and Dad drove three and-a-half hours to get me there, I told them to go almost immediately, as I didn\u2019t want to feel awkward in front of the other housemates. Luckily, I knew three of them from Facebook and we\u2019d already had ice-breaker chats.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t looking for anything too structured as I wanted the freedom to do lots of things. And it turned out none of my housemates had booked events before they came either. </p> <p>On the first night, we stayed in with bottles of wine and by the end of the evening knew every secret about each other. It was like: \u2018I\u2019m going to be living with you, so why not?\u2019</p> <p>Over the next few days, there were lots of talks and group activities where we designed things out of straws and elastic bands \u2013 it was very odd. But it was great in terms of getting to know people on my course. </p> <p>I went to the freshers\u2019 sports and society fair to see all the things on offer. You can choose from the give-it-a-go sessions, and I picked ultimate frisbee. I loved it, but my friend hated it. She wouldn\u2019t go again, so I had to make myself go alone. But they were so friendly, I never felt awkward. </p> <p>I went to a barbecue organised for the bioengineering group and got tickets for the union. We went to the university bar and out as a group into Sheffield, exploring all the different places in the city. It was fantastic. I was so tired by the end of the week, but felt very positive. It sets you up really well for the first semester as you\u2019ve done all your introductions and you\u2019ve tried out a few things. </p> <p>Fresher\u2019s week is definitely worth doing, I don\u2019t know why you wouldn\u2019t. Even shy people are fine. No one is judging you. Just put yourself out there and if someone invites you out, join in. We were all lost together.</p>",
  "<p>The resettlement of Syrian refugees has been a political flashpoint of the US presidential election. This week, Donald Trump used a speech outlining <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech\">his hardline views on immigration and national security</a> to once again raise the specter that terrorists could infiltrate the Syrian resettlement program in the US. </p> <p>As a safeguard, the Republican nominee announced that his administration would suspend immigration from Syria and Libya. Those seeking to enter the US would be subject to an \u201cextreme vetting\u201d process that Trump emphasized would be \u201cso tough\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/in-arizona-we-saw-the-real-donald-trump-the-one-we-already-knew\">In Arizona we saw the real Donald Trump: the one we already knew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before being accepted, applicants would submit to an \u201cideological certification\u201d that would ensure that those who are admitted \u201cshare our values and love our people\u201d.

Watch what\u2019s going to happen, folks. It\u2019s not going to be pretty.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond the hot rhetoric and controversial proposals, Trump is tapping into serious anxieties about national security and the threat of terrorism. Here we <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/syrian-refugees-in-america-fact-from-fiction-congress\">revisit the topic of Syrian resettlement </a>in the US in an effort to try to separate fact from fiction.</p> <h2>We actually do know who these people are</h2> <p>Despite Donald Trump\u2019s repeated claim that the US doesn\u2019t know who it lets into the country, the US\u2019s refugee vetting process is among the most rigorous in the western world. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/11/249613.htm\">The state department</a> has said that Syrians flown to the US are among the most heavily vetted group of people currently allowed into the country.</p> <p>In total, the screening process takes an average of 18 months to two years and involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies who carry out a series of security screenings and checks. </p> <p>The process begins with an initial vetting by the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency. Prospective candidates are then referred to the US, where officials from the state department, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the defense department conduct further vetting. </p> <p>The homeland security secretary, Jeh Johnson, said recently that the department had \u201cadded security checks to the process\u201d specifically for Syrian refugees as well as designated more resources to help make the process more efficient. As an added check, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services are instructed to review the social media accounts of Syrian refugee applicants who are referred for more enhanced vetting. </p> <p>Immigration officials have a very good idea of who they are accepting from Syria even before their plane touches down on American soil. </p> <h2>How many Syrian refugees has the US accepted?</h2> <p>The answer is significantly more than<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/syrian-refugees-in-america-fact-from-fiction-congress\"> the last time we posed that question</a>. </p> <p>After a painstakingly slow start, the White House announced this week that it had achieved its goal of resettling 10,000 refugees by the end of this fiscal year. </p> <p>Barack Obama made the commitment last year under pressure from Europe and the United Nations for the US to play a bigger role in confronting the global refugee crisis. The majority of the refugees were accepted in the last three months. Before that, the US had admitted just a quarter of the 10,000 displaced Syrians it pledged to resettle. In total, the US has resettled roughly 12,000 Syrian refugees since the war began five years ago.</p> <p>To help ease the integration process, the refugees are resettled in areas where they have family ties. For those who have none, the resettlement groups try to place them in cities with an established community of Syrian immigrants or where they will have the best chance of finding jobs.<br></p> <p>These groups \u2013 a coalition of humanitarian and religious nonprofits \u2013 help adults find work, enroll their children in school and learn English. During this process, they receive housing and financial assistance. One year after being admitted, refugees can apply for a green card at which point they must submit to another screening.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-u-s-should-take-65000-syrian-refugees/\"> has called </a>for the US to resettle an additional 55,000 refugees from Syria in addition to the 10,000 pledged by Obama. And even if the US were to accept 65,000 Syrian refugees, it will still be just a fraction of the more than 4.8 million Syrians who have fled mostly to neighboring countries who are bearing the biggest burden of the world\u2019s largest refugee crisis. </p> <h2><strong>Are Syrian refugees likely to be Isis sympathizers?</strong></h2> <p>The Syrian refugees who are coming to the US are among the most vulnerable in the Syrian conflict: many are women and their children, religious minorities and victims of violence or torture. Many have fled to escape the brutality of both the Islamic State, or Isis, and the Assad government and are doing so at their own peril. </p> <p>The worsening Syrian refugee crisis has undermined Isis\u2019s claim that its caliphate is a safe haven for Muslims. In choosing to risk their lives on the dangerous journey to Europe and beyond rather than join Isis\u2019s caliphate is a sharp rejection of the group and its ideology. On <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/09/22/442520787/the-flood-of-syrian-refugees-puts-isis-on-the-defensive\">several occasions the Islamic state</a> has condemned refugees who flee its strongholds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/01/us-military-iraq-syria-sean-macfarland-republican-carpet-bomb-isis\">US military commander in Iraq and Syria rejects GOP pledges to 'carpet-bomb' Isis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In effect, some experts argue that by rejecting Syrian refugees, American politicians are in fact helping Isis. When the US shuts the door on Syrian Muslims, it reinforces Isis\u2019s argument that the west does not want to assist them and that their only salvation lies in Isis.</p> <h2><strong>Could dangerous refugees come to the US?</strong></h2> <p>The refugees admitted to the US are much different than those arriving at Europe\u2019s borders. </p> <p>Unlike in Europe, where immigrants can cross through Turkey and then enter Greece, the immigrants who arrive will have cleared a lengthy screening process. Because of Europe\u2019s Schengen system, refugees could conceivably pass between EU countries without having to show a passport or submit to a background check. </p> <p>Public anxiety over the arrival of refugees has a historical precedent. The controversy over Syrian immigrants has <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/11/19/9760060/refugees-history-holocaust\">recalled</a> Americans\u2019 reluctance to accept Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany in the years just before the second world war. </p> <p>And yet an <a href=\"http://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/us-record-shows-refugees-are-not-threat\">October 2015 analysis by the Migration Policy Institute</a> is a reminder of why many of these fears are misplaced. Of the 784,000 refugees resettled in the United States since 11 September 2001, just three have been arrested for planning terrorist activities, the report found. It adds for context that of those three cases \u201ctwo were not planning an attack in the United States and the plans of the third were barely credible\u201d. </p> <p>Finally, denying Syrian refugees entry to the United States would break a decades-long American tradition. After the second world war, the US created its first formal resettlement programs and began to position itself as a safe haven for the persecuted. In the 1970s, the US accepted <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/09/syria-refugees-europe-vietnam\">hundreds of thousands</a> of Vietnamese refugees. In 1980, the US accepted as many as 125,000 Cubans during the Mariel boatlift crisis. The 1990s saw an influx of refugees fleeing the wars in Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/syrian_refugees_per_pop/giv-32650YJN6SYy5Ympe/\" data-alt=\"Refugees and population\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/syrian_refugees_per_pop/giv-32650YJN6SYy5Ympe/\">Refugees and population</a> </figure>",
  "<p>Nick Clegg has accused the former chancellor George Osborne of casually cutting the benefits of the poorest people in society because he believed taking the austerity axe to welfare would boost Conservative popularity.</p> <p>In a candid interview looking back on his five years as deputy prime minister in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition, Clegg said he found the behaviour of his senior Conservative partner \u201cvery unattractive, very cynical\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWelfare for Osborne was just a bottomless pit of savings, and it didn\u2019t really matter what the human consequences were, because focus groups had shown that the voters they wanted to appeal to were very anti-welfare, and therefore there was almost no limit to those anti-welfare prejudices,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Speaking before the publication of his anticipated political memoir, written after his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/12/strange-death-of-liberal-democrats-leadership-vote\">party was reduced to eight seats in last year\u2019s general election</a>, Clegg hit out at David Cameron and his Conservative partners in government. He said the former Tory leader or the chancellor \u2013 \u201cI honestly can\u2019t remember whom \u2013 looked genuinely nonplussed and said: \u2018I don\u2019t understand why you keep going on about the need for more social housing \u2013 it just creates Labour voters.\u2019 They genuinely saw housing as a Petri dish for voters. It was unbelievable.\u201d</p> <p>The Lib Dem MP also had harsh words for the current prime minister, Theresa May, with whom he clashed repeatedly when she was home secretary. He claimed that she \u2013 and advisers who have since become the joint chiefs of staff in Downing Street \u2013 tried to manipulate a Home Office report on immigration that was part of a cross-government exercise into the costs and benefits of EU membership. </p> <p>\u201cShe kept saying there was this terrible \u2018abuse\u2019 of freedom of movement, when simply describing EU citizens exercising their right to come and work in the UK.

In the Maldives, she encounters the young president of a sinking nation. \u201cIt is too late for us, but it\u2019s not too late for everywhere,\u201d he tells her, outlining a radical vision of artificial coastlines, floating islands and, if worst comes to worst as well it may, the relocation of the entire population to higher ground bought from another nation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/domestic-chicken-anthropocene-humanity-influenced-epoch\">How the domestic chicken rose to define the Anthropocene</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In rural India, she meets a village chief who used satellite imaging to identify defunct water courses in the rock that are now being replenished with carefully positioned monsoon dams and wells.

The Anthropocene\u2019s usual encounters with previous geological eras involve drilling, quarrying and fracking, but these villagers have effectively put a pair of spark-plugs between them, creating a model for a future sustainably powered by the interaction of past and present, constancy and change, flood and drought.</p> <p>I love this book for what it says about the resourcefulness of humanity, the capacity of ordinary people to make a difference, and for those small differences to add up to something that might even turn the planet away from its apparently unstoppable hurtle towards environmental destruction. </p> <p>Vince doesn\u2019t shirk the hard stuff \u2013 the whats, whys and whethers of conservation. She acknowledges that extinction is not unique to the Anthropocene, and she is clear that many of the schemes she witnesses will fail. But where they do, others will spring up. I keep returning to her book, because there is hope between these pages of colourful reportage: from the former fashion executive who is breeding Chinese tigers in South Africa to the Caribbean fisherman who has built a fruit garden on an island made of garbage. With such will and ingenuity, there may yet even be hope for the Asiatic cheetah.</p>",
  "<p>I came across <a href=\"http://www.frogandscot.co.uk\">Frog And Scot</a> on TripAdvisor, while researching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jul/08/trouble-with-tripadvisor-summer-food-drink-marina-oloughlin\">a piece about how much I hate TripAdvisor</a>. The irony is not lost on me. As part of the article, I wanted to examine how restaurant owners, particularly the more splenetic ones, responded to anonymous critics. Sadly, that bit didn\u2019t make the final cut, but I was hugely impressed by the grace with which this new place\u2019s owner, Benoit Dezecot, dealt with complainers, even those who deserved the lacerating edge of any tongue \u2013 those, say, who insisted their bavette was so tough they took it home and fed it to their pet crocodile, \u201cwho spat it out\u201d. Deal in Kent is clearly home to the more discerning carnivorous reptile.</p> <p>So off to this bijou, pastel-painted town, with its maritime history and crocodile-owning natives. My favourite Deal ex-native is Carry On star <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hawtrey_(actor_born_1914)\">Charlie Hawtrey</a>, frequently in trouble for his habit of hoisting seamen and rent boys into his 18th-century smuggler\u2019s cottage. (It\u2019s fair to say he\u2019s not Deal\u2019s favourite: he referred to the locals as \u201cpeasants\u201d.) Here, Dezecot and his partner Sarah Ross \u2013 the eponymous Frog and Scot \u2013 have taken over a former florist\u2019s and caff, and turned it into the platonic ideal of neighbourhood bistro.</p> <p>Here\u2019s where to come to practise shrugging expressively and rolling your Rs. For French onion soup and snails, of course; rillettes and moules; a rough-textured terrine of chicken livers bellowing with booziness and spiked with green peppercorns. Sunday brunches of croques and truffle omelettes. For Whitstable oysters with shallot-vinegar mignonette and homemade bread. Or confit duck leg, served with its pink breast and the roasting juices stirred and scraped with spices. Crabmeat, the white meat piled on to toast lubricated with its punchy, resonant brown meat, and lightly acidulated fennel adding a scintilla of crisp liquorice. Or lobster mayonnaise with chips \u2013 what could be lovelier moments from the sea?</p> <p>But the kitchen can handle more elaborate stuff, too: fish aren\u2019t just water-bathed or slapped on the grill, but a bit of both. So, brill is beautifully moist-crisp, with a sauce stained an alluring grey by avruga caviar (just what I\u2019m after for my kitchen cabinets). Lamb chops have a depth of flavour you\u2019d associate with hogget, but the tenderness of babies; with them, a croquette stuffed with the confit neck fillet is sultry with melted lamb fat.</p> <p>You can tell a lot about a place by the quality of the basics: anywhere that rejects the easy option of catering-pack chips deserves all the brownie points, and Frog And Scot\u2019s, served with a fine sirloin steak over which a pat of reeking garlic butter slowly creeps, are belters, double-cooked until almost nutty, all crisp and fluffy and lustworthy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/19/rick-stein-sandbanks-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin\">Rick Stein, Sandbanks: \u2018I\u2019m not buying it\u2019 \u2013 restaurant review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s an appreciation of ingredients: seasonal vegetables, green and perky in a light dressing of French butter. And a love of saucing based on homemade stocks: truffle creams, celeriac purees, bisques. And a total lack of crooked pinkie pretension that, round these parts, is as bracing as a dive into the British briny. They bake their own bread, churn their own ice-cream and plunge local soft fruits into the sweet, enveloping embrace of frangipane for their tarts. Sure, there are a few rough edges: menus \u2013 changing by the hour as dishes sell out and are replaced \u2013 are scrawled on blackboards; furniture is currently long, beer hall-style benches. But, as Dezecot patiently explains to the whingers, they are being gradually replaced for something more accommodating to the less tolerant arse.</p> <p>The pair also own <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/le_pinardier\">Le Pinardier</a>, a little wine shop and bar up the road, where you drink at barrels, and I\u2019m guessing that both have been kitted out on a shoestring and are developing organically, like the wines on a list featuring much that is biodynamic and natural.

Where the first major Caribbean storm in what is anticipated to be a busy hurricane season tracks next over the holiday weekend is unclear to meteorologists.

  "<h2>1<strong> Real To Reel: A Century Of War Movies</strong></h2> <p>War has blasted its way into the history of film since 1916, when a documentary about the Battle of the Somme shocked British cinema audiences. Moving images and warfare have since evolved together: war provides the camera with spectacle and emotion, as this exhibition about the making of classics from The Dam Busters to Apocalypse Now reveals. The relationship goes deeper than that, though: it was no coincidence that director Erich von Stroheim played a German officer in La Grande Illusion, because there is an analogy between the organisation of a film set and the reality of war.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.iwm.org.uk/exhibitions/iwm-london/real-to-reel-a-century-of-war-movies\">Imperial War Museum, SE1, to 8 Jan</a></em></p> <h2><strong>2 Dinh Q L\u00ea: The Colony </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8934b31d7325c4528205b668eed704c52d1052b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8934b31d7325c4528205b668eed704c52d1052b/0_395_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dinh Q L\u00ea: The Colony\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The abandoned site of one of Britain\u2019s first cinemas, the Electric Theatre in Peckham, hosts an eerie film installation by Dinh Q L\u00ea, which explores the uninhabited Chincha islands off the coast of Peru.

Frustrated by a lack of effective government response, ordinary people filled cars and transit vans with supplies, tents and secondhand clothes and set out to Europe\u2019s borders, determined to help.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/alan-kurdi-death-one-year-on-compassion-towards-refugees-fades\">The death of Alan Kurdi: one year on, compassion towards refugees fades</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last October, Tina Brocklebank, a 46-year-old student from Yorkshire, spent a week constructing tents in the Calais refugee camp with the charity <a href=\"https://www.laubergedesmigrants.fr/\">L\u2019Auberge des Migrants</a>, now part of the umbrella organisation Help Refugees. Almost a year later she is still there.</p> <p>\u201cI remember returning from Calais after that first week feeling utterly scrambled. I stood on the ferry and cried at the ease of crossing that magical 20 miles. My new friends in camp wanted more than anything to cross that stretch of water to begin a safe life and yet it is only accessible to them by risking their lives jumping on to moving trains or sneaking into lorries. I sat in a pub garden that night completely disengaged, feeling like a rabbit caught in headlights,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Despite being in a relationship and in the middle of studying for a degree, Brocklebank moved out of her rented accommodation, put her belongings in storage and returned to Calais a little over a month later. She now spends her days working with the charity Calais Kitchen distributing oil, tomatoes, onions, lentils, flour, milk, tea, sugar, and firewood to every tent in the camp. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8c7a828b2df4379d3e9c02f2cb81255e6cfe236\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8c7a828b2df4379d3e9c02f2cb81255e6cfe236/0_94_523_500/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tina Brocklebank, a volunteer working in Calais.\" width=\"500\" height=\"478\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The people in Calais are the inspiring ones.

People queue for hours for a six-minute shower. It is so disrespectful, undignified and humiliating. This is why we distribute packages, to alleviate the queuing,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The crisis in and around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/uk-and-french-authorities-blind-to-growing-problems-in-calais-jungle\">the refugee camp near Calais in France is worse than ever</a>. The number of people is at an all-time high of almost 10,000, months after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/29/french-authorities-begin-clearance-of-part-of-calais-jungle-camp\">French authorities dismantled a significant part of the camp</a>. Calais Kitchen spends \u00a320,000 a month on food, <a href=\"https://mydonate.bt.com/donation/start.html?charity=152188\">all raised from public donations</a>. Charities say they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/calais-refugee-camp-running-out-of-food-as-donor-fatigue-sees-donations-dry-up\">are running out of supplies on a daily basis</a>, with refugees reporting they are going hungry.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an awful, desperately uncomfortable position of having to make a judgment on how much food to give people because we simply don\u2019t have enough. I have to challenge people who say that there are eight people sleeping in a tent when we can clearly see there are only five. But we know it\u2019s because our weekly food package only lasts a few days,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cI went to Calais to make a small difference, but in reality it was my world that will be forever different because of what I\u2019ve seen and heard.\u201d<br></p> <p>In the year since Alan\u2019s death, the number of public-founded aid charities has soared. Paul Hutchings, 48, from Brighton, volunteered in Calais last September. Devastated by what he saw, he quit his job as a market researcher this year to set up <a href=\"https://mydonate.bt.com/charities/refugeessupporteurope\">Refugee Support Europe</a>, a charity based in Greece. </p> <p>\u201cI watched a premature baby slowly die in the camp over the course of 10 days, because the hospitals couldn\u2019t provide care and the large agencies weren\u2019t able to commit. I was sick of seeing people like you and me who have had to suffer such trauma being treated so badly by Europe. I could just not sit by,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cfc236cff8ea650ea6a3579028aa4101850e6d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cfc236cff8ea650ea6a3579028aa4101850e6d1/22_0_607_752/404.jpg\" alt=\"Refugee children in paddling pools\" width=\"404\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We have pool parties on Sundays and we put in two swings as part of a larger playground. Large organisations or governments aren\u2019t able to move as quickly as us,\u2019 says Paul Hutchings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Refugee Support Europe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked if there is a need for smaller grassroots charities, Hutchings is certain there is. </p> <p>\u201cWe were asked by the Greek army to provide a step for the wash basins for the children to wash their hands, because no one else could pay for it. We just paid for it straight away. It cost \u20ac200. Our organisation makes sure to buy locally so we support the Greek economy at the same time,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Like many other newly launched aid organisations, Hutchings\u2019 charity operates in a gap the more established organisations cannot fill. Their flexibility means the changing needs of the camp can be responded to as and when they arise.</p> <p>\u201cWe built benches and tables and a large space where people can gather, discuss, play games, sew, and watch films. For the kids we have pool parties on Sundays and we put in two swings as part of a larger playground. Large organisations or governments aren\u2019t able to move as quickly as us. I can see the difference we\u2019re making,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWorking on a camp can be exhausting and upsetting but to see the human spirit continue to shine through adversity puts many of my trivial concerns into perspective. I feel so privileged to be doing this with awe-inspiring volunteers too; they are the best of humanity.\u201d</p> <p>But not everyone is in a position to quit their jobs to take on physically and mentally exhausting unpaid work. Instead, thousands of ordinary people are doing what they can to help from where they live. Julia, 42, from Milton Keynes, helps refugees relocating to her area through the charities Citizens: MK and the British Red Cross. She helps furnish houses for refugee families, and offers help, support and friendship when they arrive.</p> <p>\u201cWe have had problems with neighbours vandalising refugee properties. We had to reject a council house lined up for a family with four children the day before the move as there were live wires hanging out of the walls, and boiler leaks on to electrics. The next three families are coming on 7 September and to date we have only one house,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cBut if I am able to help, I must. I can\u2019t change the world but if I can make a difference to one person, one family, I am changing their world.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel, a 60-year-old teaching assistant, has been hosting refugees in Oxford since last year. Her grandmother was a refugee from Lithuania, and her mother was six years old when she was forced to flee Germany. These family histories, in part, encourage her to continue volunteering. </p> <p>\u201cThese people have been through so much; they deserve much, much better. Many come as unaccompanied children and once they reach 18 years old they have all support cut off. They are not entitled to housing or education or benefits. Most have no families and they have already spent years here and put down roots. What are they supposed to do? They are just kids who have been terribly traumatised,\u201d she says.</p> <p>As charities warn of donor fatigue, there is a greater than ever need for volunteers and donations. This week 6,500 refugees, many from Eritrea and Somalia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/dramatic-photos-show-refugees-fleeing-libya-being-rescued-at-sea\">were rescued off the coast of Libya</a>. The latest <a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.helprefugees.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/census-edit-kids.jpg\">census figures</a> show a 30% increase in refugees in the Calais camp\u2019s population in a month. And at least 24,000 people are believed to have made the journey along the Balkans migration trail <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/tens-of-thousands-migrate-through-balkans-since-route-declared-shut\">since the route shut in early March</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5573446e450ee65a1c6aa20cddf5af282b06ad3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5573446e450ee65a1c6aa20cddf5af282b06ad3d/455_39_970_582/500.jpg\" alt=\"Refugee Support Europe volunteers\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Recently, the ministry of education approached us, a small charity, to provide two classrooms for the four- to seven-year-olds so the three teachers they could provide would have somewhere to teach,\u2019 says Paul Hutchings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Refugee Support Europe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like many others unable to travel to the camps, 74-year-old Valerie Johnstone knew she had to do something to help. She dedicates her time to volunteering with asylum seekers in her small village in south-west France. Nine months ago, 17 men from Calais were temporarily settled in her village while they waited for their asylum applications to be reviewed. </p> <p>\u201cWe hosted cinema evenings at our house, had meals, raised money so they could all have shoes. Now they are scattered throughout France, with only five so far having gained asylum. They have all been here with us for summer holidays. We call them family now,\u201d says Johnstone.</p> <p>\u201cWe have gained as much as we have given from these young men and now we just want to see them settled with safe lives and then jobs. If everyone would just care for someone the world would be a better place.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon\">Nicola Sturgeon</a> has argued that the changed circumstances brought about by the Brexit vote give the SNP the responsibility to lead a new debate on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence\">independence</a>, while directly challenging <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a> over her mandate to take <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland\">Scotland</a> out of the single market.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/snp\">SNP</a> leader announced her plan to reach more than two million Scots in 90 days through online surveys, doorstep discussions and town hall meetings, as she launched \u201cthe biggest listening exercise in our party\u2019s history\u201d, which will run from now until St Andrew\u2019s Day, on 30 November.</p> <p>Speaking to an assembly of the party\u2019s MPs, MSPs and MEPs in Stirling, she said: \u201cWe want to understand in detail how people feel now about Europe, Brexit and independence. We want to know the concerns that people have and the questions they want answered. We want to build, if we can, a consensus on the way ahead.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/28/the-guardian-view-on-a-second-scottish-referendum-sturgeon-has-no-choice-but-caution\">The Guardian view on a second Scottish referendum: Sturgeon has no choice but caution | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the most significant mass mobilisation of the party\u2019s hugely expanded membership since September 2014, Sturgeon said each one of the SNP\u2019s 120,000 members would be sent a pack of survey cards, and would be asked to commit to completing the survey with at least five people each month for the next three months. Likewise, she asked the audience of parliamentarians to hold at least one town hall event each to engage directly with their constituents.</p> <p>Sturgeon also suggested a potential red line in triggering a second independence referendum, saying: \u201cMy message to the prime minister is this: you may have a mandate in England and Wales to leave the EU but you do not have a clear mandate to take any part of the UK out of the single market.\u201d</p> <p>Party sources confirmed that Sturgeon\u2019s view was that remaining within the single market was essential for both Scotland and the rest of the UK. </p> <p>Sturgeon went on to challenge unionist assertions that a future vote in favour of independence would jeopardise trade and open borders with the rest of the UK. She said: \u201cJust yesterday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/daviddavis\">David Davis</a> made a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/01/brexit-secretary-no-return-to-hard-border-in-ireland\">speech in Belfast</a> ... that Brexit would not mean the end of the common travel area with independent Ireland, that it would not lead to a hard border between the north and south of Ireland and it would not result in barriers to trade ... The UK government cannot say that in Ireland but then get away with saying the opposite here in Scotland.\u201d</p> <p>In a speech that focused heavily on the economics of independence, which those leading the 2014 yes campaign acknowledge significantly weakened their case, Sturgeon said next week\u2019s programme for government would outline measures to stimulate the Scottish economy and support jobs through the uncertainty of a Brexit.</p> <p>Referring to last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/24/scottish-finances-worsen-fall-oil-revenues-15bn-deficit\">government expenditure and revenue Scotland</a> figures \u2013 which revealed a deficit of nearly \u00a315m \u2013 as \u201cnot a verdict on independence but an indictment of generations of Westminster government\u201d, she announced a new party growth commission, chaired by the former MSP Andrew Wilson. The commission will examine the prospects for Scotland\u2019s finances as an independent country, and consider policies to both boost growth and reduce the deficit to a sustainable level. </p> <p>Sturgeon insisted the case for independence was about more than EU membership, telling her audience: \u201cBrexit is simply one illustration of the democratic deficit at the heart of the Westminster system.\u201d With a nod to the 38% of Scots who voted to exit the EU in June, she said: \u201cWhether you voted to remain in the EU or to leave, the more fundamental question is: who decides?\u201d </p> <p>She said this democratic deficit had been exacerbated over the summer by the \u201cself-indulgence\u201d of the Labour party, which had opened the door to \u201cperhaps decades\u201d of Tory government by its \u201cself-destructive\u201d behaviour. </p> <p>The Scottish Labour leader, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/kezia-dugdale\">Kezia Dugdale</a>, said in response: \u201cThe majority of Scotland had hoped Nicola Sturgeon was listening on 18 September 2014. In the coming week Nicola Sturgeon has the opportunity to lay a programme for government before the most powerful Scottish parliament ever. Instead of reforming education to give our young people the skills they need to compete for the jobs of the future, Nicola Sturgeon is deciding to drag Scotland back to the arguments of the past.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Sturgeon\u2019s insistence that the Brexit vote had shifted Scottish opinion, a YouGov poll for the Times Scotland on Friday suggested the figure in favour of independence had barely shifted over the past two years, despite the June referendum. It also found that while 12% of previous no voters were now in favour of independence, 13% of previous yes voters had switched to supporting the union.</p> <p>SNP sources said the new survey would be as focused on why previous yes supporters had changed their minds. It will be paid for entirely by party funds and the information gathered will remain for internal party use. </p>",
  "<p>In the Pentagon\u2019s fight against Islamic State, the Kurds had always been a good fit. In northern Iraq they were both trusted ally and known quantity. On the battlefields of Syria they were seen as better trained, more able and more motivated than any other group, including the Arab militias that the US had supported elsewhere in the war.</p> <p>There remained one big problem, though: Turkey. With a deep and unresolved enmity towards the very groups the US had chosen as allies in Syria, the arrangement was always likely to rupture.

The bottom line is that a solution to the increasingly opaque and endlessly destructive conflict seems further away than ever.<br></p> <p>Turkey\u2019s entry into the war has exposed a rapidly shifting series of alliances that would not have been predictable at the start of the year, making surefooted partnerships now seem hesitant. Back then, the losses of the Syrian regime were being steadily turned around through a robust Russian intervention, which had battered opposition groups in the north of the country and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/15/kurds-carve-out-new-reality-in-northern-syria\">sent the Syrian Kurds into areas they had never before controlled</a>. </p> <p>The Kurds\u2019 manoeuvres had two effects: to close supply lines to the border used by Turkish-backed anti-Assad groups and \u2013 far more importantly \u2013 to needle Ankara where it would hurt most, by helping move Kurds into a 90-mile zone between a Kurdish enclave in north-west Syria and another in the north-east, therefore unifying the two areas.</p> <p>It was precisely the nightmare scenario that Ankara had warned Washington about throughout its use of Kurdish groups as a proxy to fight Isis. The closing of the gap would change the demographic of the entire 500-mile border and, in doing so, create strategic depth for the PKK in south-east Turkey, which is firmly aligned to the Syrian Kurds.</p> <p>Turkey\u2019s worst fears were confirmed late in August when Kurdish forces who had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/06/us-backed-syrian-fighters-take-town-of-manbij-from-isis\">ousted Isis from the town of Manbij</a> turned their attention towards Jarabulus, which Isis had occupied for the past two years. Jarabulus lies west of the Euphrates river, which Ankara had long insisted was a demarcation line between the US-backed adventures to the east and its own core interests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"774903186d9d76e99e975da518c6084adcfa331b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/774903186d9d76e99e975da518c6084adcfa331b/0_162_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Recep Tayyip Erdog\u011fan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recep Tayyip Erdog\u011fan has suddenly emerged as a decisive player.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Depo Photos/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it steadily picked off Isis-held towns near the Iraqi border, Washington had supported the Turkish stance and claimed it could control its proxies. The pivot towards Jarabulus blindsided the US and has derailed, for the time being, further plans to march towards Isis-held Arab towns. Instead, remnants of the Free Syrian Army, backed by Turkey, are now in the ascendancy. The Arabs rode across the border on Turkish tanks and now have their sights set on the town of al-Bab, the most western area held by Isis.

Neither man sees a breakdown of the Syrian border as advancing their goals. Moscow has not objected to Turkey\u2019s advances and has even turned its guns away from the Ankara-backed rebels.<br></p> <p>The Kurds, meanwhile, claim they have been abandoned by the US, which continues to see the war as a tailored fight to contain a cornerstone of a global jihad. For all the other stakeholders, a new phase of an interminable struggle for ethnic, sectarian and national identity is being played out.<br></p> <p>It is for now impossible to reconcile competing visions for what will emerge from Syria. And it is just as difficult to see how any of the major players\u2019 key goals can be met. Turkey\u2019s detente with Russia has put both sides ahead in the lineup. On the other hand, a US-Turkish joint push into Syria appears to have been derailed by mutual distrust.</p> <p>There is little from which to take comfort for those who still live in the wastelands of Syria.

  "<p>There is something about the improbability of North Korea\u2019s very existence that makes whatever atrocity crosses the page sound entirely plausible. As the author of a non-fiction book about the country, I find myself too often answering questions from confused readers. I have had to explain repeatedly that, no, I\u2019ve not heard of political prisoners undergoing lobotomies there, as happens in Adam Johnson\u2019s justly acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/17/orphan-masters-son-adam-johnson-review\"><em>The Orphan Master\u2019s Son</em></a>; and that the author was employing techniques of magic realism to create a satirical vision of North Korea.</p> <p>So it was with some trepidation that I picked up the latest offering in the genre of fiction set there. Krys Lee is a superb writer, author of a well reviewed collection of short stories, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/09/drifting-house-krys-lee-review\"><em>Drifting House</em></a>, and her first novel has been one of the most anticipated of the year. Since it happens in the first few pages, it is not too much of a spoiler to reveal that the book opens with a bang. The scene is a lavish banquet in Pyongyang in 2009, in which Rolex-wearing members of the elite nibble on blow fish and tuna flown in from the Tokyo fish market.

Yongju, the 21-year-old son of the man shot at the banquet, needs to escape the country to avoid being held accountable for his father\u2019s offence under the regime\u2019s system of collective punishment. He is a sheltered young man \u201cwho didn\u2019t know anybody who was exiled to grim mining towns or ground tree bark into their stew in order to fill their stomachs\u2019\u2019; he and his family used to have nothing in common with provincial schoolkids forced to work in the opium fields.</p> <p>He crosses the border into China, where he has to hide with ordinary North Korean refugees. He becomes one of them, learning \u201chow to sleep with rats the size of rabbits, how to endure the slow crawl of lice. How drinking helped you live with unlivable fear.

Women are trafficked as sex workers or wives for unmarriageable Chinese farmers. Men are press-ganged into brick factories. Missionaries feed and house refugees, but sometimes keep them prisoner while they are forced to read the Bible, indoctrinated with yet another ideology to replace the blind loyalty to their home country\u2019s regimes.</p> <p>Lee has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/12/krys-lee-interview-north-koreans-became-part-of-my-world-and-then-i-got-threats-\">worked with North Korean refugees</a> and she knows intimately their terror when trying to survive in a world where it is impossible to distinguish between friend and foe; where betrayal is a fact of life and people manipulate each other with currencies of sex and religion.</p> <p>The novel switches between three narrators. Besides Yongju, the fallen scion of the elite, there is Jangmi, a pregnant defector who is locked up in a video chatroom where she has to strip on camera for South Korean perverts. (Yes, this really happens.) My favourite of the three is Danny, a Bible-thumping high school student prone to misadventures. Danny is an ethnic Korean from China who grew up in California and is as confused about his faith and sexuality as he is about his nationality. After he is robbed on a trip to China, he joins up with the others. The message is clear: without passport or money, identity or status, anybody can be as adrift as a North Korean refugee.</p> <p>\u2022 Barbara Demick\u2019s <em>Nothing to Envy: Real Lives in North Korea</em> is published by Granta.

  "<p>Growing up, I thought a lot of things my family did were normal, but with hindsight I realise they were not. For years I was blind to the strangeness of my dad\u2019s daily headstands, the loud, appreciative belches my grandfather uttered after dinner and my mother\u2019s nighttime trips to steal mustard leaves from the local farms.</p> <p>You could buy other local vegetables at the greengrocer, but never mustard leaves. Aside from in the local fields where they were a fallow crop, they were only rarely available in Asian supermarkets. They are the key ingredient in an ancient dish called <em>sarson ka saag</em>, a rich stew of mustard leaves and cornmeal that originates from Punjab, but became a regular ritual in our Lincolnshire home. It\u2019s a basic, rustic dish, but with a striking personality. Ordinary ingredients turned into something extraordinary, traditionally eaten by Indian farmers alongside <em>makkai ki roti </em>(charred corn roti) and plenty of freshly churned butter.</p> <p>In England, to make the dish of her childhood, Mum would bundle my dad, sister and I into the car late at night along with a few bags and a knife. During the day it was always too dangerous \u2013 not for the fear or shame of getting caught but for the intermittent gunfire liberally dispersed by the farmers, intended for game birds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/26/chamin-recipe-jewish-sabbath-food-tomer-amedi-a-taste-of-home\">Chamin: a recipe for a homely sabbath treat | A taste of home</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the land is so flat in Lincolnshire, when the moon comes out you can see for miles, but Dad would still put the car lights on full beam while Mum ran into the fields, the large bun coiled atop her head bobbing up and down as she quickly harvested. Every atom in my body vibrated with the tension of doing something naughty as we waited as her accomplices and getaway car.</p> <p>Back home, the greens were washed, then gently boiled. Steam rose to fill the windows, providing a discreet veil to hide our illicit deed, while the taste and smell of the fresh leaves transformed from pungent, hot and fresh to creamy, mild and earthy. We brightened the dish with fresh ginger and mellowed it with butter before eating it, like the farmers of Punjab, using our fingers and pieces of homemade hot corn rotis.</p> <p>Years after moving away from home, when I was writing my first cookbook, I quit my job and left to travel around India by train, elbowing my way into people\u2019s kitchens along the way. In Amritsar, I was invited to dinner by a local guide, Manjeet Singh and his wife, Simi. As I walked into their home, I knew just by the smell she was making <em>sarson ka saag</em>. But it transported me thousands of miles back home, to our little village in Lincolnshire. Back to the cold tense night trips, our steamy, fragrant kitchen, and the soft buttery taste of my mum\u2019s <em>sarson ka saag</em>, to take the edge off the passing of time.</p> <h2><strong>Mustard greens with fresh butter and charred corn rotis</strong></h2> <p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br>250g double cream<br>1kg mustard leaves, cut into 5cm strips<br>Rapeseed oil, for frying<br>2 large onions, finely chopped<br>5cm ginger, peeled, 4cm cut into cubes and 1cm into matchsticks<br>6 garlic cloves, crushed<br>2 green finger chillies, finely sliced<br>3 tbsp cornmeal<br>1 \u00bd tsp salt<br>20g homemade butter (see below)</p> <p><strong>For the rotis</strong><br>200g fine cornmeal<br>100g plain flour<br>\u00bd tsp salt<br>Rapeseed oil<br>2 green finger chillies, finely sliced<br>1cm ginger, peeled and grated<br>140ml hand-hot water</p> <p><strong>1</strong> To make the butter: blitz the cream for 6 minutes or so,At first the cream will transform into whipped cream then stiff peaks.

  "<p>Imagine a preeminent expert on the science of colour vision has lived her entire life in a black-and-white room. She has never seen colour for herself, but she has complete knowledge of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that make it possible. When she is released from her prison and first sees a blue sky, doesn\u2019t she nevertheless learn something new?</p> <p>The philosopher Frank Jackson once used this thought experiment to counter the notion that the world is entirely physical. Hue is an abstraction of this knowledge argument, electing to answer the question, \u201cWhat does a person learn when they see colour for the first time?\u201d with, \u201cHow to solve a lot of puzzles.\u201d<br></p> <p>Hue is a boy following in the footsteps of his mother, a scientist who escaped a greyscale life by inventing a ring called the Annular Spectrum that allows not just perception of colour but also alteration. Here, then, is the core interaction by which Hue circumvents the obstacles that lie between him and his missing mother: as he collects differently coloured segments of the ring, he can change the background of the 2D world to make objects of the same colour disappear.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eff68c49d1622076048109f96dda7f48384e82a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eff68c49d1622076048109f96dda7f48384e82a0/60_40_1733_1040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hue\u2019s greyscale world.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hue\u2019s greyscale world.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Erica Webber/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Hue, out of sight is more than out of mind. Your first colour segment is sky blue, your first task to rescue a miner trapped behind some sky-blue rubble. Match the background of the cave, and the rubble is gone. The challenge, of course, is that objects reappear if you change the background again. Solving puzzles in Hue is a case of erasing obstacles one colour at a time so that you can move them around. Need that orange box to be on the other side of the pink one? Just turn the background pink, drag your orange box across the level, and switch back to blue to see the results.<br></p> <p>Of course, this is only possible in a minimal 2D world. But despite its limited colour palette and blocky levels, Hue looks and feels charming. Hue himself is a black stencil, outlined in whatever the current colour of the background. The sea is thick white waves, the caves offer the occasional silhouetted tuft of grass, and rolling boulders are followed by puffs of white-swirled dust. </p> <p>Hue disturbs some objects as he passes: books on shelves, clinking chains, and hanging skeletons who tell him, \u201cYou\u2019re not getting under my skin!\u201d You start in a pretty little town but the action takes place in caves (themed with props since the designers couldn\u2019t fall back on colour-coding the usual forests, lava, and ice), a mountain, and a university. Each room is a puzzle. Die and you start the room again.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4510101fde99500d7bb5fde6d91d004d04d3c35d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4510101fde99500d7bb5fde6d91d004d04d3c35d/8_24_1760_1056/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Another of Hue\u2019s puzzles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another of Hue\u2019s puzzles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Erica Webber/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Explain the basic principle of Hue and it sounds quite dry, but the designers have managed to draw some interesting ideas from the core interaction. All the usual tropes of a platformer have a new dimension. A row of spikes topped with crates placed one jump apart becomes more challenging when each time you change the background every other crate disappears. Climbing a slope against a constant stream of boulders feels slightly more stressful when you can\u2019t jump over them but must keep switching to make each one invisible just before collision. Platforms that crumble beneath you are much more precarious when you have to bring them into existence before you land.<br></p> <p>The more novel and interesting puzzles, however, are those more reliant on planning. A room that involves alternately erasing an orange and pink platform to allow Hue to rearrange them is topped with a row of boulders held aloft by two barriers: one orange, one pink. Fail to plan your movements in advance and Hue will be crushed. When an orange, red, and sky-blue obstacle are separated by gates, it won\u2019t work if you place crates on the switches that open them in the same colour order. Treat Hue too much like other puzzle platformers and you\u2019ll be reminded when you try to carry out your solution that things work differently here: crates can\u2019t hold down switches or protect you from lasers if they\u2019re invisible.<br></p> <p>Most levels are short and satisfying enough to motivate you through momentum, which is useful because the story is limited. Every now and then Hue will have to walk through winding corridors as his mother narrates vaguely philosophical musings (\u201cExplaining to them the sensation of pain is like me explaining colour to someone that can only see in black and white.\u201d) or bits of her own history, which she colour-codes as you collect the relevant segments of the ring: \u201cSpring was around the corner. Yellow daffodils poked through the dirt in our backyard.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e5409a1e6ba7578012d38b8ab244e15780b5c26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e5409a1e6ba7578012d38b8ab244e15780b5c26/60_16_1773_1064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cWhat does a person learn when they see colour for the first time?\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cWhat does a person learn when they see colour for the first time?\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the first part of the game, your motivation is to collect all eight colours, each allowing you access to a new area and bringing Hue closer to his mother. Each nets you an appropriately named achievement: Like Clockwork for orange, Back to the Fuchsia for pink. Unfortunately, some are less pleasant than others. I liked that first blue, but the first time I saw yellow it hurt. And for some reason, whether because of my television settings or some genetic deficiency, I found it very difficult to distinguish pink and purple. I actually ended up playing with the colour-blind mode, which marks each colour with a symbol and vastly improved my ability to quickly select the right one. Mapping the colour wheel to the right analog stick was a smart choice, but because bringing up that ring only slows time, rather than freezing it, the main skill Hue tests is your ability to remember each colour\u2019s location and flick the stick in the right direction at speed.<br></p> <p>Unfortunately, quite a few of the later puzzles rely on reaction times alongside forward planning, and since they\u2019re often bigger than those earlier in the game, it\u2019s far more frustrating to have to restart because of a mistimed jump-and-switch or accidental misfire. For the first few hours, however, Hue\u2019s puzzles are concise, inventive, and surprising. For that, at this price, Hue is an experiment worth experiencing.<br></p> <p><strong>PS4, Steam and Xbox One, apparently coming soon on Vita, PEGI 3.

They feel they have been misrepresented by management and the press, and their anger over that was palpable. One of them also said it was the same way that junior doctors were being treated, as if they were the problem, rather than being the people trying to take action to force the people in charge to fix problems.</p> <p>3) Having said that, there were several people I spoke to who really couldn\u2019t care less about how much profit the company was making - they were absolutely exasperated with the staff and the unions.</p> <p>4) It\u2019s a lot harder to talk to people on commuter trains than it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/20/london-night-tube-meet-people-travelled-first-night-sadiq-khan\">on the night tube</a> - where people were up for a party - or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/aug/24/behind-traingate-we-retrace-corbyns-trip-to-see-reality-of-uk-rail-travel-live\">on a long distance mid-morning train</a>, where you can spot people idly sitting there looking wistfully out of the window and pounce on them. On commuter trains the focus was much more headphones on, face buried in smartphone screen. I got some odd looks from people for daring to try to start a conversation. And I have made my boss promise me I won\u2019t get sent onto another train for at least a fortnight.<br></p> <p>5) British people REALLY like talking about trains on social media and in the comments on articles.

I could generally drive there in 40-50 mins and had free parking.  The public transport option involved getting to the tram station (either a 25 minute walk or a bus ride,) a good hour on the trams and a 10 minute walk at the end.  The trams are reliable but crowded, and I have to stand until I change trams in the City Centre.  For several weeks I also had to add on a 20 minute walk across the City because the trams weren\u2019t running through services.</p> <p>Despite the fact we have a so-called integrated public transport system in Greater Manchester, you can\u2019t buy a combined tram and bus ticket until after 9.30 a.m. and you can only buy them on the bus with certain companies \u2013 and not mine, so you have to get to the tram stop anyway.  Buying tram and bus tickets costs \u00a310.40 for 2 x 90+ minute journeys (there might be slightly cheaper options but the TfGM website is impenetrable when it comes to combined fares) compared with about \u00a34.80 in petrol for 2 x 45 minutes.  The tram stop does have park and ride, but unless you get there before 8.00 a.m. it\u2019s full because of people who park there to work in the town centre, as it is not effectively monitored.</p> <p>Add to that the facts that I was an essential car user because of travel required in the job itself and I also do shopping, go out after work (e.g. choir) or visit family, then driving - in warmth and comfort, listening to my own music and admiring the buzzards, kestrels and herons you often see on an M60 commute -  becomes a no-brainer.  My brother lives in South Manchester and works in Rochdale.  His public transport journey involves trains and trams and is just as unfathomable as mine.</p> </div>   </div> <footer class=\"element-witness--footer\"> <p class=\"element-witness--source\">Sent via <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/\" class=\"element-witness--brand\" itemprop=\"provider\">GuardianWitness</a></p> <div class=\"element-witness--metadata\"> <p class=\"element-witness--author\" itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">  By  <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/KarenED\" class=\"element-witness--author-name\" itemprop=\"name\">KarenED</a> </p> <p class=\"element-witness--date\"> <time itemprop=\"dateCreated\" datetime=\"2016-09-02T11:14:58+01:00\">2 September 2016, 11:14</time> </p> </div> </footer>  </figure>  <p>And finally ... one more about Southern rail ...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-witness element-witness-text\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/WebPageElement\" data-canonical-url=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57c81764e4b09a68e9b64c4d/5002308\"> <div class=\"element-witness--main\">    <h3 class=\"element-witness--title\" itemprop=\"name\"><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57c81764e4b09a68e9b64c4d/5002308\" itemprop=\"url\">Southern, you&#39;ve finally broken me!</a></h3>  <div itemprop=\"text\"> <p>The last 5 months of Southern Rail chaos has coincided with the 20 weeks of my first pregnancy.

He claims Southern is trying to blame its own failings on the unions and calls for the government to seize back the franchise from Govia.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the past year Southern has established itself as the standard bearer for dysfunctional privatised rail services. Passengers are enduring the worst delays in the country, fares are up 25%, and public investment to improve Southern services seems a long way off.</p> <p>The primary cause of train cancellations and delays on GTR services are poor planning and management by GTR and the DFT. Southern was already the least reliable service in the country before industrial action began in the spring and GTR\u2019s management revealed their failure to prepare and plan for necessary driver numbers at a select committee session in July. Trying to pin the blame on rail unions is a politically contrived attempt to deflect criticism from the failures of management and the DFT.</p> <p>GTR\u2019s management contract or \u2018concession\u2019 with the government sees the DfT taking all the revenue risk whilst GTR is paid an annual management fee, totalling \u00a38.9bn over the life of the seven-year contract to 2021. Not only does this place all the risk on the taxpayer and the passenger, GTR is not incentivised to improve performance for passengers. But the company is incentivised to cut costs at the expense of staff and to poison industrial relations. </p> <p>Go-Ahead CEO, David Brown, let the cat out of the bag this morning when he said: \u2018A large part of the role of the GTR franchise is to introduce three new train fleets and modernise working practices.\u2019 If revenue risks were with GTR, they would never have allowed services to get to this point and if the DfT had not insisted on \u2018modernising working practices\u2019 which really means attacking trade unions in order to force through an extension of cheaper and controversial driver only operations, then the current dispute would have been settled by now and the company and the rail unions could set about restoring good industrial relations.</p> <p>Instead, GTR have been fined just \u00a32m, a pittance of the company\u2019s annual turnover of \u00a31.9bn and easily covered by the \u00a315m (36%) increase in operating profit from the rail sector announced this morning by Go-Ahead. Passengers seeking recompense for serial delays, service cancellations and failures must enter the \u2018delay-repay\u2019 lottery which is heavily loaded against them.</p> <p>Yesterday, it was announced that another \u00a320m of taxpayers\u2019 money would be spent to try to save the failing franchise. Today, the Go-Ahead group, a co-owner of the Southern franchise, announced a 27% rise in profits on last year.</p> <p>The Government should strip Southern of the franchise, end the Tory sponsored rip-off of the public and run services in the public sector. The last Labour government took this approach when franchises failed on both South Eastern and twice on the East Coast, where Directly Operated Railways went on to deliver record punctuality and passenger satisfaction scores. Passengers, not ideology or political pride, must now be the priority.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c9446fe4b09a68e9b64e5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-belam\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T09:23:24.520Z\">10.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There\u2019s been a few comments on this story over on our Facebook page. This one stood out, from Jan Foster. I think it echoes the sentiment of a lot of people below the line on this live blog, and also a couple of the people I met on my journeys this morning, who really were indignant at the timing of the profit announcement coming just a day after taxpayers\u2019 cash was pledged to sort out the problems. Jan says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The sum of \u00a320m was mentioned on various news programmes yesterday as being the amount given to Southern rail to assist them in some way. I\u2019m very confused by this. I never voted Tory and don\u2019t live in the Southern rail region, but voters were always led to believe that privatisation was the best thing ever, with more choice and competition, etc. Odd, then, that those wonderful private companies, including many banks, financial institutions and now this particular railway provider, make such a total and utter mess of running them. </p> <p>Those at the very top, however, seem to thrive on this series of cock-ups, being awarded ever-expanding salaries and bonuses and then, when they fail, they are often given hand-outs to make our benefits system weep. Yet this government support this, tacitly, by chucking more and more money in the direction of many corporate companies who are poor at best and out and out crooked at worst. </p> <p>To add insult to injury, the same government holds public servants (except for themselves and their public servant cronies, of course) in extremely low regard, denying that there are available monies to support the NHS, ambulance, police, councils and fire services while handing out \u00a320m to a failing, rubbish rail company without a qualm. </p> <p>Indeed, some government bloke appeared on the BBC news yesterday, and had the bare-faced cheek to tell viewers that \u00a320m was \u201ca drop in the ocean\u201d. Really? If it truly is a \u2018drop in the ocean\u2019 I am sure there are many more \u2018drops\u2019 it could find to fund public services which would benefit everyone and not just bail out CEOs who can\u2019t do their job.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T09:34:00.506Z\">at 10.34am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c94359e4b06b4ac1748b2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T09:21:14.860Z\">10.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>One contributor, who wishes to remain anonymous, travels on East Midlands trains from Nottingham to Leicester.

David Brown is, apparently, set to turn down his bonus and salary increase; but shouldn\u2019t he, and all the directors, be handing back their salaries after another year of failure?</p> <p>Because Southern is a company which has shown this year that it cannot - or will not - deliver on its franchise commitments. It is failing to deliver for passengers, it is letting down the government, it is selling the British taxpayer short.

Now I work in Sheffield and walk 10 minutes down the road. Trains in this country are over priced, unreliable and frankly a disgrace for a country like the UK in the 21st century.

His regular commute is just a couple of stops out of central London, and so far he says he hasn\u2019t experienced any problems with the services. \u201cFive-minute delays sometimes, but that\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve met another Kevin. When I tell him about the profit announcement he says: \u201cObviously it\u2019s unjustified. I imagine people will be aggrieved. You can be sitting on a train one minute before departure and then they tell you it\u2019s cancelled because they don\u2019t have a driver. I\u2019ve never known anything like it.\u201d</p> <p>Davina is also in this carriage. She usually works at Bluewater but is having to head south today because she is covering a shift elsewhere. She says she does this once a month, and her experience of this service isn\u2019t too bad. She does add that she\u2019s going to be late for work though.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c92426e4b00c28eaea772a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T07:04:10.066Z\">8.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One person has sent in a photo showing his train cancelled this morning - although that line all looks good now ...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-witness element-witness-image\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" data-media-id=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57c81764e4b09a68e9b64c4d/5002262\"> <div class=\"element-witness--main\">  <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57c81764e4b09a68e9b64c4d/5002262\" itemprop=\"url\"><img src=\"https://gu-witness.s3.amazonaws.com/media/c17e6034-b25d-42ae-b00c-de1ad0beecc5-mediumoriginalaspectdouble.jpg\" alt=\"Victoria station \" itemprop=\"contentURL\"/></a>    <figcaption>  <h3 class=\"element-witness--title\" itemprop=\"name\"><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57c81764e4b09a68e9b64c4d/5002262\" itemprop=\"url\">Victoria station </a></h3>  <div itemprop=\"description\"> <p>My train this morning at Victoria.

Here are some of the contributions so far: </p> <p>Walter commutes on the Hope Valley line, which connects Sheffield and Manchester - he travels between there and Rose Hill, Marple. He tells us:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The trains are very uncomfortable and busy, there are usually only two small carriages. They are noisy. They are too hot. The train station has no facilities at all - not even disabled access! There is nowhere to buy a ticket so people have to queue after getting off the train to buy one. Also the service finishes at about 8pm and there are no Sunday trains.</p> </blockquote> <p>One reader, who wishes to remain anonymous, commutes five days a week on the West Coastway line between Brighton and Southampton. It\u2019s run by Southern rail. He describes a typical day\u2019s commute: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The day begins with checking the Network Rail app as soon as I wake up so that I can see whether any trains have been delayed or cancelled. If everything seems fine I get a bit worried that the app isn\u2019t working properly. I\u2019ll step out to the station and will usually notice that the train I\u2019m aiming for is a few minutes late. This is one thing to point out, they\u2019re never on time. Ever. </p> <p>I usually have the option of a seat at my station, but the train is still crowded most of the time. A few stations along and it\u2019s standing room only. </p> <p>Coming back from work, those of us who travel by train discuss which services we can aim for and we religiously check the Network Rail website again to see if they\u2019re cancelled or delayed. On the way home, if you\u2019re not at the train when the doors open, you\u2019re not going to get a seat. </p> <p>Along the line, if London trains have been delayed or cancelled you will get two or three train loads of people trying to cram themselves on at particular stations. If you\u2019re in a wheelchair or you have a pram, you can forget it. If I\u2019m lucky, the train will be within 10 minutes of its scheduled arrival time. This is my commuting life, every single day of the working week.</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not all bad news out there though. Isabel Divanna travels on Great Northern between Cambridge and London. She says she\u2019s quite satisfied by the service:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a good line and the early train I catch in, and the mid-afternoon one I catch back, always have seats. The mid-afternoon train is often a little late, but not more than 10 minutes. My main dissatisfaction is the price - I wish it was a bit cheaper. (Her season ticket is about \u00a35,000)</p> </blockquote> <p>Do let us know about your rail commutes by clicking on the blue \u2018Contribute\u2019 button at the top of the blog or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/01/whats-it-like-being-a-rail-commuter-in-the-uk\">via our form</a>. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c87e8ee4b06b4ac1748a70\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rob-davies\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T06:48:18.508Z\">7.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2><strong>Worst 10 trains in the UK</strong></h2> <p>The Department for Transport publishes <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/541218/top-10-overcrowded-train-services-england-and-wales-autumn-2015.csv/preview\">a list of Britain\u2019s most overcrowded rail routes</a>.

Under this unusual contract, Govia only suffers small financial penalties if it doesn\u2019t meet service requirements.<br></p> <p><strong>Engineering works: </strong>Hugely disruptive upgrades to London Bridge have been compounded by signal failures, sinkholes and flooding.<br></p> <p><strong>Staff shortages:</strong> GTR has admitted it underestimated the shortfall in drivers it needs to operate trains. Industrial disputes have made it harder to find drivers and guards willing to do overtime.<br></p> <p><strong>New trains: </strong>New rolling stock has been ordered but drivers have to be retrained to operate them. That means taking them off the usual schedule, adding to staff shortages. <br></p> <p><strong>Industrial action: </strong>Some new trains have been designed to run without a guard, which unions oppose. This has fuelled strike action that only exacerbates existing problems.<br></p> <p><strong>Growth in rail usage:</strong> Passenger numbers have reached record levels and the south-east is where three-quarters of UK journeys take place. This has strained busy commuter routes to bursting point.<br></p> <p><strong>Cost cuts:</strong> The government has sought to transfer the cost of rail travel from taxpayers to passengers but fares are already so high that raising them is difficult.

It\u2019s a proper sticky-carpeted, plastic cups of wine, regulars of 80-plus kind of club. And, with a balance of new east London nights mixed in with its regular activities, it\u2019s thriving. We first attended a night called Britain\u2019s Next Top Tranny, hosted by drag queen Fabulous Russella about 10 years ago. The contrast of what we saw on stage versus what we saw around the venue was magical. The nostalgia, and sensory overload, that a traditional working men\u2019s club with heart and soul makes it, in our opinion, London\u2019s best late-night performance venue. Warren and Charlotte, who run things, always support the newest, weirdest, most wonderful talents and nights. The making of our dress-up party Sink The Pink came from their trust and support when we were just two over-excited kids with a bag of wigs. From the long-standing regular night Coney Island (where dressing up to various classic movies is encouraged, music is themed accordingly and hotdog eating competitions are standard) to The Virgin Xtravaganzah and her variety show of the best of London\u2019s alternative cabaret scene to the popular Disco 54 night, there\u2019s something for everyone. London is so lucky to have the BGWMC. <br>\u2022<em> <a href=\"http://www.workersplaytime.net/\">workersplaytime.net</a><br></em><strong>Chosen by <a href=\"http://www.sinkthepink.co.uk/\">Sink the Pink</a> co-founders, Glynfamous (Glyn Fussell) and Amy Zing (Amy Redmond)</strong></p> <h2>Soho Burlesque Club</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3881799d06ec2311698959362faaacaa0cc14ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3881799d06ec2311698959362faaacaa0cc14ba/0_52_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Soho Burlesque Club\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Soho Burlesque Club \u2013 at the Hippodrome Casino \u2013 is a properly late-night cabaret experience. The show starts at 11pm and you\u2019ll often see red-faced showgirls running across Leicester Square from earlier shows that didn\u2019t run to time (me, every single week). Not only is what is happening on stage pretty glamorous, but the audience is often full of post-show cabaret performers letting their hair down. If you want to watch cabaret\u2019s great and good consuming one too many glasses of prosecco, Saturday night at the Soho Burlesque Club is the place to go. And being in a casino lacking in natural light and time-telling devices, means that everybody stays out far too late. I once stayed out drinking there with burlesque superstar Dirty Martini until the early hours of the morning. I went upstairs to grab my bag so I could head home, sat on the very comfortable sofa in the dressing room and accidentally fell asleep. I was woken by the cleaners at lunchtime the next day. <br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://www.hippodromecasino.com/\">hippodromecasino.com</a><br></em><strong>Chosen by burlesque performer <a href=\"http://www.kittybangbang.com/\">Kitty Bang Bang</a></strong></p> <h2>Circus, Covent Garden<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f38f3b8190763204434d2c61c6b3f1f9223b9b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f38f3b8190763204434d2c61c6b3f1f9223b9b4/0_0_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Circus, Covent Garden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Circus is really more of a dinner venue and it has fabulous pop-up entertainment until 11.30pm, but then the tables are pushed backto make the restaurant into a club, which is open until about 2am. The main feature is a huge marble table that doubles as a stage: people can sit down at it and enjoy their meal, but between courses the plates are cleared and you can see world-class acrobats spinning above your head from hoops suspended from the vaulted glass ceilings. You could find <a href=\"http://legateauchocolat.com/about/\">Le Gateau Chocolat</a> high kicking along the table or, one time for a Circus birthday party, the management had a ramp built and I rode a tiny motorbike up it. It often gets travelling performers in, so you can see the likes of the Briefs cast up close and personal. The menu has to be the best food I\u2019ve had at a cabaret show and its cocktail menu is to die for! I\u2019d recommend the black angus fillet with this amazing caramel soy sauce and the lobster with white truffle aioli, washed down with a Carousel \u2013 a cocktail served with alcoholic cotton candy.<br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://circus-london.co.uk/\">circus-london.co.uk</a><br></em><strong>Chosen by Kitty Bang Bang</strong></p> <h2>Hackney Showroom</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e821346db2d0a1f69ca0cee056e139989e6cff7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e821346db2d0a1f69ca0cee056e139989e6cff7/0_44_1218_731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hackney Showroom - Leviathon Show\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Leviathon Show at Hackney Showroom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ambra Vernuccio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hackney Showroom is a DIY space that hosts cabaret, live art, variety, circus and performances: from Lasana Shabazz, Plains Plough, and the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/discolocouk\">Disco Loco festival</a> to weird bits of drag. What I love about the place is that 10 years ago when I started out on the scene there were a lot of places like that about, when you didn\u2019t have to work so hard to find a space to set up a show. Hackney Showroom is doing this at a time when venue space is scarce and prices are high. It\u2019s a 70s queer utopia, like back when they were first thinking about how to create spaces like this, but Sam and Nina have come along and done it. You can go anytime and find queer and drag shows and emerging artists from Hackney. The crowd is mixed, you get the usual bunch who go to the all the drag and cabaret shows, but they also do \u00a31 tickets for people on the local estate. It doesn\u2019t have regular nights, so you have to check what\u2019s on before you go. But you can always get cheap beer, which I love, hot patties and delicious ice-cream. I like that it\u2019s a bit of a knees up \u2013 you can get your tea, then see a show. <br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://www.hackneyshowroom.com/\">hackneyshowroom.com</a><br></em><strong>Chosen by <a href=\"http://www.scottee.co.uk/\">Scottee</a>, asscociate artist at the Roundhouse and performance collective Duckie</strong></p> <h2>Royal Vauxhall Tavern</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a81e6bf106b30704cf408288dcc60acdd4a80a36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a81e6bf106b30704cf408288dcc60acdd4a80a36/0_64_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Royal Vauxhall Tavern\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Unfortunately, queer spaces are disappearing in London, but one place that is still standing and remains the lynchpin of the scene is the Royal Vauxhall Tavern. Every Saturday I go to Duckie. I\u2019ve seen every type of performance you can imagine on that stage. Duckie programmes the most innovative live artists. I\u2019ve watched go-go dancers, opera singers, drag kings, a sexualised re-imagining of the Nativity by Lucy McCormick, and this summer I finally got to perform on it too. I was part of Duckie Homosexualist Summer School and I got to MC our showcase as a terrifying buffoon called the Matron \u2013 dressed head to toe in leather, a huge tumour bottom, a mop for a head and eight-inch high heels \u2013 shouting and swearing at the Duckie audience; an audience of drag kings, queens, students, regulars and people who had <em>no</em> idea what to expect. It was fantastic. I would not usually feel confident enough to try that sort of comedy character at other venues, but at Duckie difference is embraced. It\u2019s all about inclusiveness. I\u2019m now about to launch a comedy night as the Matron at new queer space Her Upstairs<em> </em>in Camden. I wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to, or confidence to, if it hadn\u2019t been for Duckie. <br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://www.vauxhalltavern.com/\">vauxhalltavern.com</a><br></em><strong>Chosen by <a href=\"http://www.theelflyons.com/\">Elf Lyons</a>, comedian and writer</strong></p> <h2><strong>Paper Dress Vintage, Hackney</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88852a56e8446fd9776a8034cfdb50e583f9b3dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88852a56e8446fd9776a8034cfdb50e583f9b3dd/0_52_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paper Dress Vintage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When I first moved to London I was desperate to start a comedy night here.

It\u2019s a boutique vintage dress shop and cocktail bar and is what Miss Haversham\u2019s house might have looked like if she\u2019d been brought up in the 1960s and had better social skills. A conversation with the barmaid and two emails later PDV became the home of the Secret Comedians (2012-15) and my late-night go to. The owners Steve and Hannah book an eclectic mix of music, burlesque and comedy and you can guarantee something off the wall will be on. At its Shoreditch address, the performances would take place<em> </em>in the shop window. The acts would perform amid the mannequins and vintage gowns and audiences would spill out onto the street.

  "<p>Charities are warning that they no longer have enough donated food or money to feed the rapidly growing population of refugees in the camp in Calais, with supplies running out on a daily basis and migrants reporting they are going hungry.</p> <p>\u201cA few months ago, there would be a maximum of 70 people in the lines; now we have 500 people queuing. We started running out of food about three weeks ago,\u201d said Marie Eisendick, who has helped run the <a href=\"http://refugeecommunitykitchen.com/\">Refugee Community Kitchen</a> since the beginning of the year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/02/child-refugees-calais-failed-by-britain\">Hungry, scared, and no closer to safety: child refugees failed by Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p> It was no longer possible to provide a hot meal for everyone who wanted one, and hungry people had to be turned away regularly, she added, describing the absence of better assistance from the UK and French authorities as \u201cscandalous\u201d. \u201cWe have the same resources and staff that we had three months ago, but there are thousands more people to feed.\u201d </p> <p>Latest <a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.helprefugees.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/census-edit-kids.jpg\">census figures</a> show a 30% increase in the camp\u2019s population in a month, bringing the total number to more than 9,100. About 70 new people arrive every day, with large numbers coming from Sudan and Afghanistan. Volunteers say they do not have enough tents and blankets to hand out to new arrivals.</p> <p>The fresh crisis came as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/02/france-vows-to-dismantle-jungle-refugee-camp-calais\">France\u2019s interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said the camp would be gradually dismantled</a> and accommodation would be created for thousands elsewhere in the country \u201cto unblock Calais\u201d.</p> <p> Longer lines are visible at all four distribution points, run by different charities in the camp. The long wait for food has led to rising tension in the queues, with arguments breaking out over queue jumping. \u201cPeople are very worried they will not get any food. People tell us that they are hungry,\u201d Eisendick said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c179e4886ed299e50562e22622e9ca4f4ea79124\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c179e4886ed299e50562e22622e9ca4f4ea79124/0_186_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marie Eisendick volunteers in the Refugee Community Kitchen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marie Eisendick volunteers in the Refugee Community Kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By 11.30am, a distribution caravan dispensing tents and blankets had no more supplies, and new arrivals were turned away. \u201cWe only have 30 blankets to hand out a day. We can\u2019t help any more people. We\u2019d love to be able to help, but it\u2019s finished,\u201d a volunteer shouted, attempting to disperse a crowd of disappointed arrivals.</p> <p>The struggle to feed the camp is partly the result of the absence of an official international aid agency overseeing the worsening conditions, which has forced smaller volunteer-run agencies to step in. These organisations rely on donations, which fluctuate wildly according to public awareness of the situation. Reports that the French authorities had bulldozed most of the camp in the spring led to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/27/calais-camp-france-food-refugees-business-companies-support\">rapid fall in donations</a>, but the number of refugees who have returned to live in tents and shacks has risen steadily, and 4,000 more people now live there than at the start of the year.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a sense that the refugee crisis is over in Calais, when it\u2019s actually the reverse,\u201d Eisendick said. \u201cIt angers me that a really small organisation like ours is carrying the weight of this problem without the support of the French or the British government, or bigger aid organisations. People aren\u2019t starving here, but they are hungry because there isn\u2019t enough food.

Volunteers are actively promoting France as an attractive destination and are at pains to persuade people that France is not all like Calais (a place of mud and open sewers, with no electricity or running water), but a better place, with sanitation and houses with roofs.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t speak French, I don\u2019t think they like refugees here, but I have applied to stay here. Trying to get to England is very difficult,\u201d a 19-year-old man from Afghanistan, who has been in the camp for six months, said as he queued to see a camp volunteer nurse about a chest infection. The asylum application process was slow, and so he remains stuck in the camp waiting for a decision. </p> <p>Much of his life is punctuated by queuing. Waiting in line for clothes distribution can take more than three hours now that the camp is so full. \u201cIt is more difficult with food now. You can stand for hours waiting; it makes people want to fight,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Some elements of camp life are easier in the summer. A concerted campaign to remove rubbish has alleviated a rat infestation. The paths that run through the camp are no longer waterlogged, but attempts to move people from flimsy donated camping tents into sturdier wooden huts have been frustrated by a ban on building materials. Although refugees have attempted to improve tents by insulating them with extra layers of plastic and tarpaulin as well as knitted blankets, everyone knows they will offer scant protection once the cold weather returns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d54513919c44f36ab0c4c8a9c83bae4091656991\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d54513919c44f36ab0c4c8a9c83bae4091656991/0_136_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A queue for food at the overcrowded Calais refugee camp.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A queue for food at the overcrowded Calais refugee camp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The home secretary, Amber Rudd, and Cazeneuve this week said they recognised the \u201cparticularly difficult humanitarian situation\u201d in Calais and resolved to continue working together to \u201cdiminish the migratory pressure\u201d, but among refugees there is little expectation of assistance from either government.

  "<p>When Tori Fahey packed in her job and embarked on a journey across Africa on her bike, what started as a hiatus from real life became the catalyst for an entirely new beginning.</p> <p> On the surface, her story is almost a clich\u00e9. Having worked for more than a decade in finance (in the oil and gas industry in Canada), Fahey found herself wanting more from life. But it wasn\u2019t through desperation that her circumstances changed: \u201cI didn\u2019t get fed up and storm off, nothing like that; it was curiosity about other interests and wanting to experience something new.\u201d</p> <p> Stage one was a return to education; Fahey left her job and completed an MBA before setting up a move to New York to begin a degree. However, the opportunity of an open year between the MBA and the degree came up, and as a keen touring cyclist, Fahey realised that a much dreamed-about adventure was now becoming a possibility: \u201cThe ride in Africa had been on my fantasy list. It was a moment when I realised that I could do anything, so I should. Things were happening in my personal life, and suddenly the life I might go back to in Canada wasn\u2019t there anymore. Suddenly everything was possible.\u201d</p> <p>Fahey not only rode across Africa, a 12,000-km (7,500-mile) trip that took four months and traversed Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, but she also raced solo and unsupported the 4,200km from Banff in Alberta to Antelope Wells in New Mexico on two wheels, taking everything she needed for the trip with her.</p> <p> The whole experience had a life-changing impact. Fahey is the first to admit she needed a shove in the right direction, but what is also clear is she is very much the architect: \u201cIt was a very liberating experience because there are so many things that you can\u2019t prepare for that you have to figure out on the fly, and when you start to deal with the problems that come up it\u2019s really, really rewarding to realise you can do anything.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fe476eba2984b4270f33df43a88946eff5b2633\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fe476eba2984b4270f33df43a88946eff5b2633/0_86_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not a fan of pannier and rack systems ...\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not a fan of pannier and rack systems ...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tori Fahey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBefore the trip, I considered myself quite independent, but I realised how much I valued interacting and enjoying experiences with people. The Canada-to-Mexico trip was very much a solo trip. You would spend a whole day not talking to anyone \u2013 and I realised from a biking perspective that tours I did in the future would be with people. It was an important part of the experience.\u201d<br></p> <p>Fahey also realised that, while people were important, material things were not. \u201cI realised how little I needed and how to let go of material things. I had a real tendency to cling to things, various types of safety blankets, but I realised very quickly what I did and didn\u2019t need. It was a very liberating experience, you have to figure things out on the fly and when you start to deal with the problems that come up, it\u2019s really, really rewarding to realise you can do anything.\u201d</p> <p>Post-degree, Fahey worked on projects with the UNDP (United Nations Development Project) in Montenegro, the National Innovation Fund of Kazakhstan and the Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et des Consignations de Tunisie; all with the aim of bringing venture capital and investment to rural or marginalised communities</p> <p>It was while working on these projects that the seeds were sown for the next new venture. \u201cIt was through my trip from Canada to Mexico that I discovered pannier and rack systems and my revelation from the trip was that I was never going to use them again.\u201d</p> <p>So, in 2013, <a href=\"https://www.apidura.com/\">Apidura</a> was born, producing storage solutions for people looking to travel the world by bike, race across continents and carry all they need to do so. It\u2019s now a successful global brand, but Fahey remains reflective about what the company does. \u201cIt\u2019s very different from my past life; the nice thing about the cycling industry is that you\u2019re generally dealing with people who do what they love. So it can get hectic but you\u2019re dealing with happy, honest, good people and that\u2019s a really nice perk!</p> <p>\u201cBicycles provide a literal freedom, but the emotional feelings are also so important; the types of feeling you really get when you push yourself on a bike ... You don\u2019t allow yourself to feel like that in everyday life because there are so many distractions, so when you feel happy or sad, you\u2019re distracted by something, but when you\u2019re out on the bike and there\u2019s nothing else, you\u2019re really free to experience what life is.\u201d</p>",

Only five months earlier, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/25/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-defacing-black-lives-matter-signs\">Zuckerberg had reprimanded employees</a> for repeatedly defacing \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d signs by changing them to \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFor it to be truly democratic, there would need to be a kind of ownership from everyone, and that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d says Garza. \u201cFacebook is a private company, yet we have these expectations of this platform that it serve a purpose that they\u2019ve never actually said they\u2019re there to serve.\u201d<br></p> <p>A key question for the movement is what it would take to create its own platforms: \u201cPlatforms that are ours, that don\u2019t get censored, that don\u2019t pick and choose about what content they will and won\u2019t allow.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2016/08/PI_2016.08.15_Race-and-Social-Media_FINAL.pdf\">Another Pew study</a>, which was released on 15 August and looked into BLM in some depth, found that white social media users were significantly less likely to encounter race-related content \u2013 or post it themselves \u2013 than black users.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/16/obama-black-lives-matter-doesnt-ensure-they-do\">Obama says Black Lives Matter.

It has also used by opponents of abortion and to promote animal rights \u2013 bolstering criticism that its use minimises minorities\u2019 experiences, particularly of police brutality and discrimination. With the unprecedented online activity citing #BlackLivesMatter over 13 days in July, the Pew study found a \u201cdramatic\u201d shift in tone of the online conversation and a spike in support for #AllLivesMatter \u2013 and for #BlueLivesMatter, an affirmation of the lives of police officers.</p> <p>Mentioning the persistence of such rejoinders, which have dogged the BLM movement since it began, raises a rare spark of irritation from Garza \u2013 albeit accompanied by her characteristic incredulous chuckle.

Not always going up against the BBC might help. </p> <p>And in any case, one advantage of not being the leading news programme (and not being the BBC) is that time shifts are likely to provoke a little less anger.

But this month the number of people in the camp reached an all-time high of almost 10,000 people, aid organisations estimate.</p> <p>The French authorities put the official number of people in the camp at almost 7,000. Authorities have said over the past year more than 5,000 asylum seekers have left the northern French town for 161 special centres set up around France.</p> <p>Cazeneuve said places for another 8,000 asylum seekers would be created this year and thousands more in 2017, saying efforts would be focused on getting peole in Calais to leave voluntarily.</p> <p>Currently a record 1,900 French police are operating in Calais, and Cazeneuve said another 200 would be added to their ranks \u201cto reinforce the battle\u201d against migrants smuggling themselves on to lorries bound for Britain.</p> <p>Daniel Barney, of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), which opened a health centre in the camp, warned last week that the French and UK governments were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/uk-and-french-authorities-blind-to-growing-problems-in-calais-jungle\">turning a blind eye to the growing problems</a>.</p> <p>He said the French authorities\u2019 decision to demolish the southern part of the camp in March had made the situation worse. \u201cHalf the camp was dismantled. So now we have double the population living in half as much land, with access to the same amount of water points and toilets. There is an extreme problem of overcrowding. Conditions in the camp are getting progressively worse.\u201d</p> <p>With overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, food shortages and a rise in the number of violent attacks on lorry drivers heading to the UK, there is growing tension in Calais and politicians from all parties are seizing on the seemingly intractable problem of how to deal with refugees and migrants trapped in France hoping to reach England. In the run-up to the French presidential election next year, the French right and far-right have increased their calls for hardline action on Calais. </p> <p>Cazeneuve will visit Calais on Friday afternoon, as French lorry drivers, shopkeepers and farmers plan to stage a blockade of the port on Monday to demand the camp is demolished.</p> <p>The Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who has until now avoided visiting Calais, is to visit the city later this month.</p>",
  "<p>Twelve months ago, the limp body of a Syrian child on a Turkish beach shook the conscience of the world.

Theresa May and Amber Rudd should go to the global summit on refugees led by President Barack Obama later this month to try to reach new commitments on aid and resettlement, as well as resolving conflicts that are forcing people from their homes. Britain must be part of new international partnerships and action, rather than using the Brexit vote as an excuse to turn inwards.

Share your experiences</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week in Calais I met a Syrian teenager who was given Home Office approval two months ago to join family in Britain, but still hadn\u2019t been given his paperwork to travel, leaving him alone, scared and tired, in a gang-ridden camp. After our cross-party visit attracted and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/what-am-i-waiting-for-child-refugees-trapped-in-calais-appeal-to-mps\">coverage in the Guardian</a>, the Home Office finally gave him a date to rejoin his family \u2013 in a further fortnight. This kind of delay puts children\u2019s safety and lives at risk.</p> <p>Rudd must urgently speed up the system so that at least 500 child refugees can be here and safe before Christmas. She must also pledge to work with the French to ensure no child spends another winter in the horrors of the Calais camp.</p> <p>A year ago this week I made a speech calling for action to help refugees, just a few days before the picture of Alan Kurdi appeared. I said then that future generations will judge us on our response. We must not let our government\u2019s foot-dragging leave children at risk and put us all to shame.</p>",
  "<p>From April 2017, tens of thousands of people will be hit by rent hikes around the country, particularly in the south east. Under the government\u2019s \u201cpay to stay\u201d programme, households earning more than \u00a340,000 in London, or \u00a331,000 outside the capital, will be forced to pay on average \u00a31,000 extra a year in rent. To reach the threshold, as a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/aug/31/pay-to-stay-social-housing-hit-low-earners\">Guardian analysis showed</a>, tenants have to earn only one or two pounds more a week than the lowest earning 10% of Britons. </p> <p>This isn\u2019t robbing from the rich to give to the poor: since the money is returned to the Treasury, it\u2019s a reverse Robin Hood move that only entrenches poverty among low-paid workers. </p> <p>Tom (not his real name) is one of the people likely to be hit by pay to stay. In his late twenties, after multiple bad experiences with private renting, he decided to move into his parents\u2019 flat in north-west London with his wife and baby. The hope is to save for three or four years to get together enough for a deposit, giving his small family some stability. Tom did everything he was supposed to: he opened a Help to Buy ISA, contributes towards the rent and bills, and is keeping an eye on places the couple may be able to afford to buy in the next few years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/aug/31/pay-to-stay-social-housing-hit-low-earners\">What is pay to stay and who will be affected?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now the rug may be pulled from under his feet: the council flat isn\u2019t huge, but the family are happy to focus their efforts on making the situation work for long-term gain. However, from April they will be hit by pay to stay - Tom\u2019s mother works for the NHS and his father is a painter and decorator. Combined, the pay of Tom\u2019s mother and father would be just below the threshold \u2013 but non-dependent children are included in calculations for pay to stay, so Tom and his mother\u2019s salary combined takes the household over the threshold. Instead of saving for their own home now, Tom is likely to be forced into trying to plug the rent gap when the measures come in. </p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t see too many options,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIf I try to get a lower-paid job there\u2019s a very thin line between being paid too much to be allowed to stay with my parents and not being paid enough for my wife to be allowed to stay in the country as she\u2019s from outside the European Union and I have to earn a minimum amount come visa renewal.\u201d This perverse incentive has been brought up repeatedly by frontline housing staff and tenants themselves \u2013 several tenants have told me they\u2019ve been advised to reduce their working hours to save money, as paying the extra rent will cost them far more. </p> <p>Tom\u2019s neighbours who have bought their homesface no such problems: this is a direct attack on people renting socially, and seems designed to punish people for hard work, or as in Tom\u2019s case, trying to help their children on to the property ladder. \u201cBack in the 80s, my parents resisted right to buy while all the neighbours bought up,\u201d Tom says. \u201cI think, unfortunately, that might be the only way we can stay in the home I grew up in. But given house prices in the area, there\u2019s a pretty big chance we wouldn\u2019t be able to get the mortgage anyway.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/01/tories-pay-to-stay-housing-social-rents-tenants-homes\">Even in housing, the Tories stoop to divide and rule | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Renting nearby would cost three times what the household pays now, so they they simply can\u2019t afford it.

When Hungary shut its border on 15 September, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/17/croatia-overwhelmed-by-volume-of-refugees-crossing-from-serbia\">Croatia and Slovenia simply picked up the slack</a>, allowing hundreds of thousands of migrants to cross their territory instead. That month, Donald Tusk, the European council president, stood next to Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the Hungarian prime minister, and said that he fundamentally <a href=\"http://budapestbeacon.com/politics/tusk-gives-orban-lesson-on-christianity/26746\">disagreed with Orb\u00e1n\u2019s vision of Christianity</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e3cf4ec1c71410d2c9245e63c033b826400d8b1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3cf4ec1c71410d2c9245e63c033b826400d8b1f/0_0_3419_2929/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The front pages of six British national newspapers featuring the picture of Alan Kurdi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"857\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The front pages of six British national newspapers featuring the picture of Alan Kurdi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA Wire/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But on the anniversary of Alan\u2019s death, Hungary believes it has all but won the argument on European migration policy. \u201cMost of the countries have come to the same conclusions that we came to last year,\u201d says Zoltan Kovacs, the Hungarian government spokesman. \u201cThey didn\u2019t see it as we saw it last year, and there are still people in Brussels who don\u2019t. But common sense has prevailed.\u201d</p> <p>With rightwing populists on the rise across the continent, and a perceived connection between migration and terrorism, Europe has gradually abandoned the humanitarian approach of last winter. Austria, which was once a key German ally on migration policy, <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/austrian-minister-wants-to-replicate-australian-model-for-migrants/\">now wants an Australian-style approach</a> that could see Greece formally used as a giant holding bay for asylum seekers, just as Canberra controversially uses the island state of Nauru to detain people trying to reach Australia.

And if the EU had its way, most of the few people still arriving on the Greek islands \u2013 the weekly numbers are now in the hundreds, rather than the tens of thousands \u2013 would now be deported back to Turkey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/eu-deal-turkey-migrants-refugees-q-and-a\">under the EU-Turkey migration deal</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"810edff70921f3814ba2b1414bc0ccbe0bb2576a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/810edff70921f3814ba2b1414bc0ccbe0bb2576a/269_250_3823_2487/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Migrants walk to Hegyeshalom on the Hungarian-Austrian border in September 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Migrants walk to Hegyeshalom on the Hungarian-Austrian border in September 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But with both deportations and relocations having stalled, 57,000 people are trapped in squalid conditions in Greece with no word on their future, prompting Syrians such as Mohammad to despair.</p> <p>\u201cIn September, Orb\u00e1n was the bad guy,\u201d summarises Gerald Knaus, head of the European Stability Initiative, the thinktank that first floated the idea of the EU-Turkey deal. \u201cYet by the end of the year he was the leader of a coalition of states.

As Knaus saw it, the deportation of refugees back to Turkey can be justified if their cases are assessed swiftly and efficiently in Greece; if Turkey improves its asylum system; and if Europe creates the legal means of mass-resettlement from Turkey.

Nevertheless it is still far from clear, perhaps even to May herself, what will emerge once she has finished with her hammer and chisel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/restricting-immigration-will-be-at-heart-of-brexit-deal-theresa-may-says\">Restricting immigration will be at heart of Brexit deal, Theresa May says</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-launches-conservative-leadership-bid-brexit-means-brexit-video\" title=\"\">May\u2019s well-tried line about Brexit meaning Brexit </a>has been a useful summer defence against attempts to bounce her into committing herself before she was ready. It allowed her to scotch suspicions that a predominantly pro-remain government would attempt to renege on the people\u2019s verdict. It also bought her time to clarify what, in her view, Brexit really adds up to. But its shelf-life is over now and decision time is getting close.</p> <p>Wednesday\u2019s cabinet meeting showed that what Brexit really means is still a work in progress. To extend the sculpture analogy, it showed that May has begun to shape and narrow the block of marble without starting to cut irrevocably into it. The precise outlines of the figure to be carved remain hidden. But some things are now not in&#xa0;doubt.</p> <p>It was always clear, for instance, that meaningful migration controls would be at the heart of any Brexit package that May will accept. Border controls are crucial to the social reform Toryism she stands for. That was explicitly confirmed this week. Free movement as we know it will end. The rules governing movement to and from the 27 remaining European Union member states will change. Downing Street claims to have a pretty clear idea of what it wants to achieve.</p> <p>Likewise, it has always been obvious that May will look to maintain existing EU single market trading links as much as possible. As an aim it\u2019s a no-brainer. But the reality is something else. You can\u2019t be in the single market without free movement, so if the UK forsakes free movement, in what sense can it still access the single market? Deciding how far to push that is not a dilemma for London, but one for the whole EU.</p> <p>True, it is a mistake to think that no compromises whatever are possible. The single market is not just one undifferentiated system. Services, digital issues, energy and transport are all not fully unified. Even rights to free movement can be differentiated \u2013 like existing length of stay, the position of dependents, students and, in particular, those in and with offers of employment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc3d9a0c406d088d70706b8c983b64de292119b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc3d9a0c406d088d70706b8c983b64de292119b1/0_183_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May at Chequers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May at Chequers: \u2018Wednesday\u2019s cabinet meeting showed that what Brexit really means is still a work in progress.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nevertheless, it is naive to imagine May either wants to or could deliver continued freedom of movement in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. The Brexit vote was many things, but at its heart it was a revolt against migration, both real and imagined. Others may be in denial about this, but the prime minister certainly is not.</p> <p>It therefore follows that Britain has not got a hope in hell of negotiating a deal that keeps the country in the single market after Brexit. Freedom of movement is not a detail, to be casually set aside. And if the UK is determined to end freedom of movement, it also follows that UK access to the single market will be very limited.</p> <p>Not enough people have grasped this yet. Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform thinktank says \u201cthe British people are living in cloud cuckoo land\u201d about the economic impact. Most prophets of post-Brexit economic doom are lying low at the moment \u2013 August\u2019s rebound in manufacturing being the latest reason for them to do so. But it is hard to imagine how a Britain outside the single market will not struggle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All the choices that follow from Brexit are difficult \u2013 and many of them are very bad ones indeed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s why the real political tension in the May cabinet is actually not between the remainers and the leavers, as many have too easily assumed. People who were at the meeting claim there is reasonable agreement among ministers about the shape of the strategy so far. The bigger faultline is the one between the Treasury, which wants the single market to be the priority, and No&#xa0;10, which puts migration control first.</p> <p>Since No&#xa0;10 will ultimately win that battle, the question is how the Treasury will react. In its determination to maintain the City of London\u2019s global position outside the single market, the Treasury will find itself inexorably drawn down the road towards remaking the UK as an offshore, low-tax financial haven. Just at the very moment when the EU locks horns with Apple over sweetheart tax deals, so Britain may roll out the welcome mat to international corporations such as Apple, offering Britain as the new Ireland, or as a European Singapore.</p> <p>There was a sign of that changing mood this week when Carolyn Fairbairn, the new head of the CBI, urged the government <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/248396/let-banks-off-naughty-step-fight-london-post-brexit-says\" title=\"\">to allow the banks to come \u201coff the naughty step</a>\u201d, said City regulators should prioritise competitiveness and proposed scrapping the current 8% surcharge on bank profits. George Osborne\u2019s brief post-referendum flirtation with a low corporation tax regime was ended by his sacking in July. But the pressure on Philip Hammond to follow that path seems likely to grow as the shape of the Brexit stance gradually becomes clearer this autumn.</p> <p>This will present May with a huge dilemma. If she sanctions a drive towards lower tax, lighter-touch financial regulation, she will delight the Thatcherite Brexiteers such as the international trade secretary, Liam Fox. He told Wednesday\u2019s meeting that Britain had to rediscover a Victorian buccaneering spirit \u2013 language that may not travel as well as Fox imagines. May herself talked this week about forging a unique new role for the UK in the world, so some of that may have rubbed off on her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/31/theresa-may-brexiteers-conservative-right-prime-minister\">Has Theresa May really thrown in her lot with the Brexiteers? | Jackie Ashley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But a re-embrace of City bankers and an even more sumptuous welcome mat to global corporations would be disastrous for the Tories. A decent opposition would make hay with it. It would make a mockery of the claim that Britain should be \u201ca country that works for everyone\u201d. This claim has been central to May\u2019s political positioning ever since the referendum (and indeed long before that). And it is now to be the theme of the post-referendum Tory party conference in Birmingham next month.</p> <p>May and her ministers aren\u2019t stupid people. They know they are advancing into an autumn in which all the big political and economic calls are connected and all have big consequences. They mostly understand the problems they face. What they lack at this stage are the answers. But the inescapable truth is that all the choices that follow from Brexit are difficult \u2013 and many of them are very bad ones indeed.</p> <p>Some may see an angel in the block of marble.

  "<p>Malcolm Turnbull says he has excoriated the three senior ministers who left parliament early on Thursday evening, leaving his government exposed to an embarrassing hit by Labor, but he\u2019s glad it happened in the first week of parliament because it will not happen again.</p> <p>Senior Coalition ministers Christopher Pyne, Mathias Cormann, George Brandis, and Michael Keenan staged a media blitz on Friday, along with Turnbull, in a mass <em>mea culpa.</em> They appeared on numerous radio and television stations to explain why the government\u2019s parliamentary \u201cstuff up\u201d on Thursday did not mean it was not in control.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/01/labor-wins-votes-in-lower-house-to-force-coalition-to-debate-banking-inquiry\">Labor wins votes in lower house to force Coalition to debate banking inquiry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Turnbull told 3AW\u2019s Neil Mitchell that the only reason Labor had won some procedural votes in parliament on Thursday, despite his government\u2019s majority, was because some Coalition ministers had left the building early \u201cwhen they should not have\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTwo of them were cabinet ministers and one of them was a minister,\u201d Turnbull said.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re grown ups, they\u2019re experienced parliamentarians, they knew that they should not have left and they left early because they thought they\u2019d get away with it. [But] they\u2019ve been caught out, they\u2019ve been embarrassed, they\u2019ve been humiliated, they\u2019ve been excoriated, and it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p> <p>The Turnbull government<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/01/labor-wins-votes-in-lower-house-to-force-coalition-to-debate-banking-inquiry\"> lost votes on the floor of the House of Representatives on Thursday evening </a>after Labor moved to bring a motion calling for a banking royal commission.</p> <p>Labor had capitalised on the fact that senior Coalition figures, including the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, and two Western Australians, the justice minister, Michael Keenan, and social services minister, Christian Porter, had left the chamber early.</p> <p>It was the first time a majority government had lost a vote on the floor of the House since 1962.</p> <p>It left the government red-faced and fuming, with Bronwyn Bishop telling Sky News on Thursday night that the event was an \u201cabsolute farce\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHonestly I cannot believe what happened today,\u201d Bishop said. </p> <p>\u201cWith only 76 people and one in the chair, everyone had to be around. And the fact that some people on the first week went home early before the end of the adjournment debate is an absolute disgrace.\u201d</p> <p>Keenan apologised to his colleagues on Friday, admitting on ABC radio that Malcolm Turnbull had \u201cmade his view clear to me that he thinks that [was] unacceptable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEvery member should be available for divisions at all times and I haven\u2019t failed in that responsibility in the past and won\u2019t be failing in that responsibility again in the future,\u201d Keenan said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a decision that I shouldn\u2019t have taken and obviously I\u2019m sorry that I did. It was a work-related matter but that\u2019s obviously no excuse.\u201d</p> <p>Christopher Pyne, the leader of government business in the lower house, also conceded on Nine\u2019s Today<em> </em>program that the government had misstepped: \u201cThere is no doubt what happened late yesterday afternoon was a stuff up. Those people who weren\u2019t there learnt a valuable lesson, everyone learnt a valuable lesson.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a salutary lesson for anyone who went home before the House rose yesterday afternoon. I\u2019m absolutely certain that they won\u2019t do that again,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201c[But] these were three procedural votes and quite frankly, people out there in the community are more worried about jobs. They\u2019re more worried about feeding themselves and their children than they are about three adjournment votes in the House of Representatives,\u201d he said.</p> <p>George Brandis said the vote loss shouldn\u2019t have occurred, but he heard Keenan apologising on radio and people needed to put things in perspective.</p> <p>\u201cBut I think we have to put this into perspective ... this was a motion of a procedural character, it wasn\u2019t a vote on a bill,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a political stunt that Bill Shorten decided to pull and he got away with it because there was indiscipline on the part of a small number of my colleagues.\u201d</p> <p>Opposition leader Bill Shorten denied on Friday Labor\u2019s tactics amounted to a stunt. </p> <p>\u201cLabor wants to have justice for banking victims,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cLabor wants a banking royal commission. The Liberals just want to go home. I don\u2019t think that the challenge of tens of thousands of people, a generation of Australians who have been ripped off and let down \u2013 it is not a stunt, it is not a laughing matter.\u201d</p> <p>Shorten reiterated that Labor would work with the government where possible, but said Malcom Turnbull was \u201cturning bungling into an art form\u201d, and his promises of stable government had been shown to be false.</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a stable majority. It\u2019s taken them precisely two days ... to prove that Mr Turnbull can\u2019t manage the parliament,\u201d Shorten said. </p> <p>Labor senator Stephen Conroy said Tony Abbott\u2019s recent complaint that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/26/tony-abbott-urges-turnbull-to-pursue-reform-to-counter-populist-politics\">this government was not in power</a> was true: \u201cIt\u2019s not often I agree with Tony Abbott, but this is a government that\u2019s in office but not actually running the country,\u201d Conroy told ABC radio.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen again ... complacency, arrogance, ministers who think they can just leave the building without permission from anybody.</p> <p>Turnbull rejected that point on Friday, saying his government is running the country.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe are in office and we are in power,\u201d he said.</p>"
