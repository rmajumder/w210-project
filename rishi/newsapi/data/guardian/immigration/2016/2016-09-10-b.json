  "<p>The world\u2019s biggest wine forger started small. It was the early 2000s, and a young man who went by the name of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/california-man-wine-fraud-prison\">Rudy Kurniawan</a> began to make a name for himself on the Los Angeles scene. He had swept-back hair and a hearty laugh. More importantly, he had pockets of seemingly infinite depth, so his new friends overlooked his mysterious origins. It was said he came from a wealthy Sino-Indonesian family, living large off handouts. But nobody pressed too hard as long as the dinners \u2013 and booze \u2013 kept flowing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In one auction alone in 2006, Kurniawan sold $24.7m of wine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kurniawan also had a palate of rare finesse, better than most at identifying the characteristics of different vintages. Or at least, that\u2019s what the people he fooled said. At first he was interested in Californian wines, in particular pinot noir, but soon developed a taste for Burgundy, made mainly from the same grape but far more glamorous. In Burgundy\u2019s Byzantine system of appellations, Kurniawan sensed hard profits. He became a major player at auctions, buying \u2013 and selling \u2013some of the 20th century\u2019s greatest wines. He bought so much <a href=\"http://www.romanee-conti.com/#/Accueil\">Domaine de la Roman\u00e9e-Conti</a> he became known as \u201cDr Conti\u201d, which presumably later amused some of those he defrauded.</p> <p>In one auction at <a href=\"https://www.ackerwines.com/\">Acker Merrall &amp; Condit</a> in 2006, Kurniawan sold $24.7m of wine, beating the previous record by $10m. These were the days of the first dotcom boom, when Silicon Valley had more money than sense, a combination which has always been drawn to fine wines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c47f4f011df860709a71b63208218eb46ab05a78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c47f4f011df860709a71b63208218eb46ab05a78/0_162_4928_2955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corked: foil capsules, labels and corks that were used as evidence in the trial of Rudy Kurniawan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corked: foil capsules, labels and corks that were used as evidence in the trial of Rudy Kurniawan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In time, however, discrepancies appeared in the market. Bottles of Clos St Denis from Domaine Ponsot, of vintages between 1945 and 1971, started to turn up. Laurent Ponsot, the head of the house, found this surprising as his family only started making the wine in 1982. He set out to investigate.</p> <p>Around the same time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/24/wine-fraud-lawsuit-billionaire-bill-koch\">Bill Koch</a>, an American billionaire who found fake bottles in his collection, hired private detectives and filed a lawsuit. Authentication experts saw more and more dodgy consignments emerging from these record-breaking auctions. At last the FBI got involved. In March 2012 they raided Kurniawan\u2019s house in Arcadia, California. They found a fully equipped counterfeiting workshop, complete with corking tools, labels, empty bottles and extensive tasting notes. Kurniawan had been taking cheaper wines \u2013 though still better than you will find in your average off-licence \u2013 and putting them in more expensive bottles, or altering bottles to appear more valuable.</p> <p>The most expensive wines are so rarely drunk few can claim to be expert on how they taste. On the occasions they are opened, it is usually courtesy of a generous host. It is poor guestmanship to lob aspersions on any proffered bottle, let alone one that cost as much as your car. What\u2019s more, several scientific studies have shown that even professed experts are hardly better than chance at identifying different wines. The entire industry hangs on the word of the critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/may/21/foodanddrink\">Robert Parker</a>, whose scores are a benchmark against how wines are priced. A Princeton economist came up with an algorithm based on weather data from the grape crop\u2019s growth period that nearly exactly mimicked Parker\u2019s scores.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7f9b5bde8b29086da6ec559189aa0e691468ef7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7f9b5bde8b29086da6ec559189aa0e691468ef7/57_78_3846_2308/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caught red-handed: bottles being prepared att Kurniawan\u2019s California home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caught red-handed: bottles being prepared att Kurniawan\u2019s California home</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The feeling of being scammed will be familiar to almost anyone who has ordered wine in a restaurant: Kurniawan simply scaled it up. In 2014 he was sentenced to 10 years in a California prison, the first person to be convicted of wine fraud.</p> <p>A new documentary, <a href=\"http://www.sourgrapesfilm.com/\"><em>Sour Grapes</em></a>, revisits the story. It came about after two directors met by chance at Kurniawan\u2019s trial. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/05/donor-unknown-jerry-rothwell-review\">Jerry Rothwell</a>, an Englishman who had been working on a film about the founders of Greenpeace, was following Laurent Ponsot on the trail of his faked wine. Reuben Atlas, an American, was coming from the opposite view. Having read about the arrest in <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/rudy-kurniawan-wine-fraud-2012-5/\"><em>New York Magazine</em></a>, and not being a wine buff himself, Atlas thought Kurniawan sounded like a Robin Hood figure, taking only from those who could afford to pay.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The FBI found a fully equipped counterfeiting workshop at Kurniawan\u2019s house</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe were always at the back of the line for interviews in court, so we ended up talking to each other a lot,\u201d says Rothwell. \u201cPretty quickly we worked out that we could work together, and given the nature of the story it was helpful to have someone in Europe and someone in America. It\u2019s like the opposite of an Agatha Christie story, where there is one detective and multiple suspects. Here there were multiple detectives.\u201d</p> <p>The tale is told through a mixture of interviews and archive footage. A film crew had followed Kurniawan for a few days early on, for a pilot of a food and wine show that was never made. These scraps let us see Kurniawan as he must have appeared to the world he conned: boyish, charming, evasive. \u201cCan we put the cork back in the bottle,\u201d he jokes at one point. Knowing how his story ends, it is compelling, and very funny. Like Atlas, you cheer along as he toys with his new friends. One group calls itself the Angry Men because of the way they feel when they take a good bottle to a party and find everyone else has bought plonk. At Angry Men dinners, $200,000 might be drunk in a night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e76cc53d819e0e0389574d6a824478b7bdc4fc85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e76cc53d819e0e0389574d6a824478b7bdc4fc85/0_341_4378_2627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spot the difference: three bottles of wine used as evidence in Rudy Kurniawan\u2019s trial.

The magnum dates from a time when magnums were not available</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Atlas and Rothwell tried in vain to secure an interview with Kurniawan. Once they knew they wouldn\u2019t have time with him, the nature of the film changed. \u201cIt became a film about being conned, rather than the conman,\u201d says Rothwell. Even then it wasn\u2019t easy to get hold of the collectors: few want to admit they have been duped.</p> <p>Ponsot was essential to Kurniawan\u2019s unravelling. Unlike many in the wine community, he does not take himself too seriously. Above a well-kept grey and black beard, his eyes have a Gallic twinkle. He saves seriousness for the concept of Burgundy. \u201cThe fakes are like a piece of dirt on the name of Burgundy,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to wash it off.\u201d</p> <p>From the American end, the pursuit was led by Bill Koch, brother of Charles and David who run Koch Industries and are part of a vast oil and gas dynasty. With an estimated fortune of $2bn, Bill left the family firm and became a collector of sculpture, ancient Greek coins, model ships, real ships (his team won the America\u2019s Cup in 1992) and impressionist art. Interviewed in front of a wall of Monets in his Florida mansion, he comes across like a teddy bear with a temper.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Can we put the cork back in the bottle,' Kurniawan jokes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI hate being cheated,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a code of silence in the wine industry \u2013 I was not going to take it. With super-fine wines you can taste the love the vintner had in making it, and that to me is almost a religious experience. We collectors like precious things. What price can you put on love?\u201d he says, before correcting himself. \u201cWell, when you get divorced you can.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn some ways Bill had more resources than the FBI,\u201d says Rothwell. Without Koch, the trial might never have come to pass. He hired Brad Goldstein, a private investigator who prefers beer and clearly finds the whole wine scene preposterous. Goldstein had spotted a magnum of P\u00e9trus from 1921, a time when they made no magnums.</p> <p>Those duped were almost exclusively male. These were men showing off, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jay-mcinerney\">Jay McInerney</a>, the Manhattan literary enfant terrible who has mellowed into a wine critic. There is \u201cHollywood\u201d Jef Levy, a red-nosed sunglass-clad producer of films you won\u2019t have heard of. There\u2019s a drawling suit-clad investor, swirling a glass in a taxi across town. \u201cBuy \u201906 Champagne,\u201d he tells us. \u201cIf you can\u2019t afford that, buy \u201902. If you can\u2019t afford that, drink fucking beer.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s striking how easily those in the boys\u2019 club were prepared to believe in the character of Kurniawan \u2013 an ingenue immigrant with plenty of cash, who wanted to be part of their gang. \u201cEveryone in the story could play themselves in the Hollywood movie,\u201d says Atlas. \u201cThey were all so perfectly cast: you pick up on who they are very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>The effect of the rogues\u2019 gallery is that Kurniawan comes across as a more sympathetic figure. As with a diamond heist, you root for the plucky conman rather than the rich victims, and like any great forger, Kurniawan is a skilful artist himself. Part of the reason it took so long for the fraud to emerge is that as long as a bottle of fake wine is passed from cellar to cellar, nobody loses out. In one of those gleaming snippets of old footage, Kurniawan tells his fellow diners to beware of online auctions, where you can\u2019t be sure of the wine\u2019s provenance.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One expert suspects 80% of pre-1980 Burgundy is counterfeit</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen we started out I thought: \u2018Here\u2019s a guy who\u2019s sticking it to rich people, and good on him,\u2019\u201d says Atlas. \u201cBut as I got to know the people involved, and understand the process of wine-making, I became less sympathetic. My perspective changed.\u201d</p> <p>Kurniawan\u2019s was the first case of wine fraud to be successfully prosecuted in the US. But the government did not chase the paper trail back to Indonesia. There are signs he was not acting alone. Ponsot believes it would have been impossible for one man to produce so many counterfeit bottles, and also that wine fraud is a much bigger problem than has been acknowledged. In a recent interview he said he suspected 80% of the Burgundy allegedly from before 1980 is counterfeit.</p> <p>\u201cRudy is by no means the only faker,\u201d Rothwell agrees, pointing to the stories from France about \u201cwine terrorism\u201d, where a group of activists has taken to smashing up vineyards and storage facilities, partly out of fears over cheap Spanish imports.</p> <p>Kurniawan\u2019s family is tantalising, and in the far reaches of his story lie implications darker than the cellars of a few movie moguls. The investigators allege that Kurniawan\u2019s real name is Zhen Wang Huang \u2013 \u201cRudy Kurniawan\u201d is a compound of two famous Indonesian badminton players \u2013 and he was denied a US visa in 2003. The documentary traces his mother\u2019s brothers, Hendra Rahardja and Eddy Tansil, back to an infamous bank fraud, where $800m was stolen and has not been recovered. Tansil is still at large, supposedly in China. In 2007 alone, Kurniawan wired $17m to his brothers in Hong Kong and Indonesia. And although email documentation shows Kurniawan was often desperately short of money, he still lived in a mansion and drove a Ferrari.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that some of his friends from the wine world still don\u2019t want to believe what Kurniawan did. Hollywood Jef slips between the past and present tenses talking about his old friend, incredulous that this could have happened. \u201cI still don\u2019t know whether Rudy got into wine and then saw an opportunity, or saw wine as the opportunity from the start,\u201d says Rothwell. \u201cAnything that depends on what people want to believe is a complex area.\u201d When rich men want to spend money, they\u2019ll find a way to do it, in other words. To prove the point, a market has already emerged for Kurniawan\u2019s wines \u2013 both the unadulterated bottles in his collection and also the fakes that survive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8f2e9551805bd2056c86a873a8f16982e6e7ee90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f2e9551805bd2056c86a873a8f16982e6e7ee90/0_0_3080_3847/801.jpg\" alt=\"Bad bottles: a magnum of P\u00e9trus 1947 from the trial\u2026 only it isn\u2019t.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bad bottles: a magnum of P\u00e9trus 1947 from the trial\u2026 only it isn\u2019t.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cTaste is obviously really subjective and contextual, and it\u2019s hard to put into words,\u201d says Rothwell. \u201cBut with wine it\u2019s not as simple as saying it\u2019s the emperor\u2019s new clothes, or that this was a victimless crime. There are bigger questions of authenticity, which is why Ponsot is so important to the tale. This reaches deep into French soil and French history, and for him is quite abstract. Whether you\u2019re into wine or not, it\u2019s a story about human fallibility.\u201d</p> <p>Whose, though? Wine is meant to bring people together, in warmth, conversation and laughter. Beyond this we add history, mystique and science, mainly because they are fun. The spirit of wine frolics around naked; it is not a suited accountant. Few drinkers, as they uncork an \u00a38 bottle from Tesco, think in terms of investment, or the authenticity of the bottle. Rudy Kurniawan broke the law, but Dionysus would surely have chuckled.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sourgrapesfilm.com/\">Sour Grapes</a><em> is released on 16 September</em></p>",
  "<p>In an industry that swaggers with bombast and fury, the continuing presence of BBC Alba in Scotland\u2019s television firmament is a delight. The Gaelic-medium station, which launched eight years ago, often reaches out to the rest of us and when you lift the silken veil and take a peek from time to time you are never disappointed.</p> <p>It sits bashfully between ITV2 and STV Glasgow and just a few places along from the big channels. On Thursday night, forsaking all others and dodging the Redneck Zone (though I do have a soft spot for<em> Ice Truckers USA</em>) I watched a splendid documentary on the life of Eva Braun, Hitler\u2019s mistress, which also chronicled the final descent into physical and mental decay of the F\u00dchrer and in which it was revealed that Fraulein Braun doted on her two Scots terriers. The programme appeared to have been made by BBC Alba itself as the commentary was in Gaelic with English subtitles. It was the best thing I\u2019ve watched all week.</p> <p>Its coverage of football, out with the Old Firm, is both refreshing and ground-breaking. It dispenses with the tired, decades-old format, favoured by the BBC, of spoiling the half-time interval with worthless, predictable and semi-literate nonsense by former footballers. Instead, there are mini-documentaries behind the scenes at the clubs. It is sharp and innovative, unlike the coverage on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/16/bbc-scotland-scottish-six-downgraded-television\" title=\"\">BBC Scotland</a>.</p> <p>BBC Alba has reached a watershed in its existence when, despite its success, it is at a point where the corporation chiefs in London must decide if it will assist further in its development for a relatively modest outlay. The station, by any of the instruments used to measure such things, has been an outstanding success. Seven out of 10 Gaelic speakers in Scotland watch BBC Alba every week, which is the same reach that BBC1 enjoys nationally. Astonishingly, 15% of all viewers in Scotland have a look at least once every week. Soon though, the station\u2019s health will be threatened because it is running out of the oxygen of new programmes. Of its current output, 74% consists of repeats, a figure that, no matter how much goodwill is extended to the station, is unsustainable in the long term.</p> <p>As the BBC finalises its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/09/bbc-charter-renewal-government-white-paper-scheduling-pay\" title=\"\">charter renewal</a> offering, BBC Alba is asking London to commit to 10 hours of new programming per week. The current level stands at 4.2 hours. It is not an unreasonable request and does not affect BBC Scotland\u2019s struggles for more consideration from London. A 10-hour new programme commitment from London would bring BBC Alba into line with the weekly quotient granted to S4C, the Welsh language public service television station for the past 30 years. BBC Alba currently gets 3p of the \u00a312.13 monthly licence fee, yet its Welsh Language equivalent gets 10 times that sum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/12/bbc-to-launch-online-tv-channel-scotland\">BBC to launch online TV channel for Scotland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both the Scottish and UK governments have commended Alba for its excellence and for having surpassed all the targets that it has ever been set since its inception eight years ago. The BBC Trust annual review report and Westminster\u2019s culture, media and sport committee have both expressed support.</p> <p>The station also has a fruitful relationship with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/sep/08/could-an-independent-scotland-keep-the-bbc\" title=\"\">BBC Scotland</a>. On more than one occasion I\u2019ve heard a BBC producer at Pacific Quay say: \u201cI wish we\u2019d thought of that\u201d in response to another good documentary offering from its wee Gaelic sibling.</p> <p>The future of BBC Alba is bound up with ideas of cultural diversity in modern Scotland. Its fate will form part of what we would like our Scotland to look like. Astonishingly, in this country there are still voices raised in exasperation whenever there is talk of public funding for the Gaelic language. It was a shrill cry heard occasionally on the Unionist side of our great constitutional debate. \u201cWhy must we bother about a language spoken by only 60,000 people?\u201d It exhibits the same absence of imagination that is suspicious of anything that isn\u2019t uniform or safely ordered by Control Centre.</p> <p>It also betrays a shocking ignorance of what the Gaelic society and history have added to Scotland\u2019s cultural exchequer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Unlike Scotland, Ireland and Wales preserve and nourish their ancient tongues as a rare and delicate gift</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a nation, Scotland has neglected its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/29/dont-neglect-uks-indigenous-languages\" title=\"\">Gaelic culture</a> and language; allowing it to wither from lack of funding at a time when Ireland and Wales, by comparison, are eager to preserve and nourish their ancient tongues, each in the knowledge that they have been bequeathed a rare and delicate gift. In parts of civic Scotland, a Roundhead attitude persists over funding for Gaelic culture that dictates that if it doesn\u2019t seem to have a significant cost benefit then it\u2019s not worth pursuing.</p> <p>Yet BBC Alba has been at the centre of a grassroots cultural renaissance in the Highlands and Islands and beyond that is sparking employment opportunities in the creative industries. During 2015-16, BBC Alba commissioned 454 hours of content from 26 Scottish production companies. MG Alba, which operates BBC Alba, estimates that more than 300 jobs are driven by its work, of which 40% are in the Highlands and Islands, a region that has suffered from depopulation as generations of young people migrate. This trend is beginning to be halted and, in places, reversed and BBC Alba is at the heart of the reawakening.</p> <p>Recent documentaries on Jock Stein and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/apr/10/jim-baxter-great-scots-premier-league\" title=\"\">Jim Baxter</a> and one on Hamish Henderson, the Scottish poet and songwriter, have equalled the best of anything the national broadcaster has offered. It also covers those smaller arts and music festivals deemed not to be sufficiently large for the big broadcaster. In this way, it stimulates interest and creativity in the arts in Scotland\u2019s more remote areas, which just happen to cover most of our landmass. In particular, the runaway success of the Gaelic drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/sep/12/how-the-inbetweeners-movie-triggered-a-gaelic-film-and-tv-new-wave\" title=\"\"><em>Bannan</em></a> has boosted the economy of the Highlands and Islands. Already, it is estimated that the drama provides 14 full-time jobs alone on the island of Skye.</p> <p>BBC Alba is not simply showcasing the Gaelic language \u2013 it is at the centre of a quiet cultural reseeding of an area that Lowland Scotland has long ignored. Now is the time to let BBC Alba spread its wings a little further.</p>",
  "<p>In a few days, European Space Agency controllers will order their Rosetta space probe to make an orbital correction that will send the craft on a collision course with the comet it has been circling for more than two years.</p> <p>The manoeuvre will end one of the most successful space missions ever undertaken and will give scientists a final chance to examine a comet up close and personal.</p> <p>Rosetta, which cost more than \u00a3750m to build and launch, has been orbiting Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, a massive ball of ice, dust and organic materials, since 2014.

Yet with Rosetta we have set the gold standard for comet research. In 20 years, scientists will still be doing PhDs using data from Rosetta.\u201d</p> <p>The probe was launched from Kourou in French Guiana in March 2004, on a trajectory that involved three fly-bys of Earth and one of Mars on its route to Comet 67P. The probe reached its target in August 2014, revealing the comet, which circles the sun every 6.5 years, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/13/rosetta-captures-images-of-jet-blasting-comet\">a strange twin-lobed object covered with craters, hills and cliffs</a>. Three months later,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/ng-interactive/2014/nov/13/rosetta-mission-philae-comet-67p-interactive-graphic\"> Rosetta dropped a tiny lander craft called Philae on to the comet\u2019s surface</a>, which was found to be made of hard ice covered by a thick layer of dust in which organic chemicals could be detected. Philae also provided crucial data about the comet\u2019s structure, which was shown to be highly porous.</p> <p>\u201cComet 67P is amazingly light as a result of all these cavities,\u201d said Open University geologist Natalie Starkey. \u201cIt is like a big lump of pumice that measures 3km by 5km. If you dropped it in the sea, it would float.\u201d</p> <p>Philae stopped transmitting on 15 November but Rosetta continued to orbit and study 67P as it made its closest approach to the sun last year, analysing the plumes of dust and water vapour that erupted from the comet\u2019s surface.</p> <p>A key Rosetta mission target was to search for evidence that the Earth\u2019s oceans might be made of water brought to our planet by comets. Many scientists say Earth would have been so hot during its formation that all water would have been driven off its surface. Later \u2013 once it had cooled, it was argued \u2013 water was brought here by bombardments of comets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fb35b157065a982280d572b04619bf4bec202b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fb35b157065a982280d572b04619bf4bec202b0/117_0_1877_1126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An artist\u2019s impression of the Philae lander on the surface of the comet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An artist\u2019s impression of the Philae lander on the surface of the comet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ESA/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But by studying the atoms of hydrogen and its isotope deuterium found in ice on 67P, Rosetta showed that the comet\u2019s hydrogen-deuterium ratio is significantly different from that found in the water of the Earth\u2019s oceans. \u201cWe have to conclude that Earth\u2019s water did not come from comets like 67P. That is a key early outcome of the Rosetta mission,\u201d said Starkey. \u201cIt means we will need to search elsewhere in the solar system, possibly on asteroids, to find the source of the water that makes up our oceans.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, Rosetta\u2019s discovery on 67P of organic molecules \u2013 including the amino acid glycine, commonly found in proteins, and phosphorus, a key component of DNA and cell membranes \u2013 does back the idea, which Rosetta was also designed to test, that material from comets could have played a key role in the early appearance of life on Earth.</p> <p>Now Comet 67P is heading back into deep space, with Rosetta still in orbit \u2013 though the power supplied by its solar panels is rapidly dwindling as it gets further from the sun.</p> <p>\u201cWe faced a choice,\u201d said McCaughrean. \u201cWe could put the craft into hibernation, as we did between 2011 and 2014, when Rosetta was travelling through deep space towards 67P. Then, once the comet was back near the sun, we could try to reactivate it. However, the probe is getting old after two years of operation near a comet and is now covered in dust. We felt there was a real risk it wouldn\u2019t wake up again. So the mission team decided this would be the end.\u201d</p> <p>A special target has been selected for Rosetta\u2019s last mission, however: a region of holes, or active pits, on the comet\u2019s \u201chead\u201d (the smaller of its two lobes). Jets of dust and vapour have been seen pouring from these during the comet\u2019s closest approach to the sun. \u201cThe heat of the sun, spreading through the comet, warms underground deposits of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide ice,\u201d said McCaughrean.</p> <p>\u201cThese deposits then evaporate, leaving caverns whose roofs collapse. Inside them, you can see features we call goosebumps or dragon\u2019s eggs that could be primordial objects from which the comet formed. So we\u2019re taking Rosetta down to study these.\u201d</p> <p>The beginning of the end for the craft will come in a matter of weeks, on 29 September, when controllers will manoeuvre Rosetta 20km above the active pits and point it downwards. \u201cWe will go down very slowly, under a metre a second, so we can take as many high-resolution pictures and spectrographic measurements as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWith luck we will get some very interesting data.\u201d</p> <p>When Rosetta hits the surface, its antenna will not be able to point at Earth and the craft will be switched off. \u201cThat will be the end of Rosetta,\u201d said McCaughrean. \u201cIt will be an emotional moment. This has been a wonderful mission and a great team effort.\u201d</p> <h2>Other comet and asteroid missions</h2> <p><strong>Giotto</strong> Launched by the European Space Agency, this was the first craft to make close-up observations of a comet \u2013 when it got to within a few hundred miles of the nucleus of Halley\u2019s comet in 1986.</p> <p><strong>Deep Impact</strong> This Nasa space probe approached comet Tempel 1 in 2005 and fired a 370kg projectile at it. The impact blew out debris from the comet\u2019s nucleus, and this was then studied by cameras on the probe.</p> <p><strong>Stardust</strong> A 300kg US space probe launched in 1999, it collected dust samples from the coma of comet Wild 2 and returned them to Earth in 2006.</p> <p><strong>Hayabusa 2</strong> Launched by Japan on 3 December 2014, and scheduled to reach asteroid Ryugu in June 2018, it is set to use an explosive device to dig for a sample of asteroid material and return it to Earth in 2020.</p> <p><strong>Osiris-Rex</strong> Launched by Nasa last week, this probe is heading towards a 500-metre-wide asteroid called Bennu, with the aim of returning a sample of material to Earth on 24 September 2023.</p>",
  "<p>The urge to bluster is universal among reckless men who have risked everything. They boom that events have proved them right, as if booming can drown the thought that they have made a colossal error. As their mistakes can cause the worst damage, politicians, propagandists and the politically committed in general are the worst blusterers of all.</p> <p>The front page of the <em>Daily Express</em> of 8 August 1939 contains one of the finest blusters in British history. Lord Beaverbrook, the proprietor, had so supported appeasing Hitler he dropped Winston Churchill from his pages for warning of the Nazi threat.</p> <p>Beaverbrook and his journalists were desperate to prove that they had not betrayed their country. Under the headline \u201cNo War This Year\u201d, the<em> Express</em> assured its readers that no less an authority than \u201cMr Selkirk Panton\u201d, its Berlin correspondent, believed that \u201cHerr Hitler, despite all his mysticism, is a hard-headed, hard-boiled politician\u2026 He will not risk everything over some <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/11238013\" title=\"\">hasty action</a>\u201d.</p> <p>On 1 September 1939, Hitler invaded Poland. On 3 September, Britain and France declared war on Germany. As luck would have it, on 3 September 2016 \u2013 77 years to the day after its \u201cno war this year\u201d prediction failed so spectacularly \u2013 the print edition of the <em>Express </em>led with the headline that Britain was in a \u201cBrexit boom\u201d. Along with the rest of the rightwing press and the politicians who have led us to this pass, the <em>Express</em> is loud in its insistence that the \u201cdoom mongers\u201d had been proved wrong.</p> <p>Now, as then, we see the same desperation to believe that the Conservatives have not betrayed their country and the same refusal to face reality. We are not in recession because the Bank of England has pumped cheap money into the economy with Weimaresque abandon and reduced interest rates to their lowest level ever.</p> <p>Keynes\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://medium.com/@DuncanWeldon/negative-yields-the-euthanasia-of-the-rentier-political-economy-dc3131d8d85e#.rpiyp0vn0\" title=\"\">euthanasia of the rentier</a>\u201d is upon us and might be an appealing prospect if the rentiers whose interest payments were vanishing were the misers of 19th-century fiction. As everyone saving for a pension is a rentier now, however, the Brexit \u201cboom\u201d rests on the bank ordering a miserable future for millions.</p> <p>The lie direct of the Brexit campaign was that the European Union cost us \u00a3350m a week. The bigger lie, which some Leave supporters may even have believed, was that there were no hard choices. We could have it all. Immigration controls, prosperity, access to EU markets, without compliance with EU laws\u2026 Whatever we wanted, at no cost at all.</p> <p>Or as Boris Johnson, a politician who has never made the mistake of believing what <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">he says</a>, told his credulous supporters: \u201cThis is a great country and great economy and I think people know we can do brilliantly if we take back control.\u201d</p> <p>An honest version of Johnson (if you can imagine such a creature) would have gone to the Nissan car workers in Sunderland and said words to the effect of: we may be able to deliver the immigration controls you want if we leave the single market but there is a risk that you will lose your jobs if we do.</p> <p>The cynicism of Johnson, Gove and Farage\u2019s failure to lay out the difficult decisions shocked the naive.

You can see us shrinking in the way leaders at the G20 treated Theresa May as an awkward \u201ccrasher\u201d who had got in by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/g20-theresa-may-warns-of-tough-times-for-uk-economy-after-brexit\" title=\"\">mistake </a>; in Japan\u2019s undiplomatic hints that not just Nissan but all Japanese businesses in Britain will think about leaving if we leave the single market; and in America and Australia\u2019s announcements that securing a trade deal with the EU came before securing trade deals with the UK.</p> <p>Not that we can secure trade deals just like that.

Yet a new trade deal will result in \u201csignificantly more red tape for British companies exporting to the EU as British exporters will have to obtain proof of origin certificates from their national customs authorities\u201d, certificates that will increase trade costs with the EU by between 4% and 15%.</p> <p>We cannot strike agreements with 50 countries currently covered by our EU arrangements until we strike a trade deal with the EU, because everyone else will want to know where we stand.</p> <p>We won\u2019t strike a deal with the EU, for \u2013 what? \u2013 three, five 10 years? How many jobs will be lost and foreign investors driven away in the process is a subject the prime minister needs to start talking about.</p> <p>Instead of facing up to the scale of the uncertainty, today\u2019s Conservatives kid themselves as their ancestors did in the 1930s. Listen to Conservative ministers and read the rightwing press and delusion is on display everywhere.</p> <p>Boris Johnson says we are a great country. Not any more. What greatness we possessed came from our alliances. By voting to leave we have ignored the advice of every friend we had in the world. Now we are asking the countries we spurned to help us and they are finding reasons to look away.</p> <p>The right says the EU will want to give us a better deal out than we had in because the EU nations will still want their exporters to sell to us. They don\u2019t look at how politically impossible it would be for Europe\u2019s leaders to tear up EU rules when they are having to face down their own xenophobes and Europhobes.</p> <p>They don\u2019t have a shred of evidence that the EU will appease us. Just a forlorn hope and an echo of voices from the time of the British appeasers. They were as convinced that they were dealing with \u201chard-headed, hard-boiled politicians\u201d, who would do whatever Britain wanted and not \u201crisk everything over some hasty action\u201d. They were as befuddled.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments will be opened later today</p>",
  "<p>The main finding from our poll, carried out in the middle of last month, is that immigration is uniting the right but dividing the left. Based on the answers given on a range of issues, we were able to separate people into eight political tribes. The two largest we identified were on the right of British politics, and make up half of the electorate. While they disagree about some economic issues, they are broadly united in favour of leaving the EU and reducing immigration sharply.</p> <p>One (we call it Common Sense, 26% of those polled) is made up overwhelmingly of Conservative voters, mainly older people from the south of England who are advanced in their careers or retired. The other (Our Britain, 24%) mostly comprises older working-class people from the north of England and the Midlands, and is split between Tory and Ukip voters. Both would prioritise reducing immigration over remaining in the EU single market. Interestingly in the light of last week\u2019s announcement, both would also favour more grammar schools. They represent a solid core of rightwing votes.</p> <p>Closer to the centre but still on the right of it sit two smaller pro-business tribes (Free Liberals, 7%) and New Britain (6%). These two groups agree with the Common Sense group about the need for low taxes and restricting benefits but are much more pro-immigration, voted Remain in the referendum and want Brexit to mean staying in the single market. But both are overwhelmingly pro-Conservative in their political outlook and there isn\u2019t really any other party that is a natural fit so they are unlikely to drift away. Theresa May has a large pool to fish in and plenty of options.</p> <p>By comparison, and looking at the tribes further on the left, the situation faced by whoever wins the Labour leadership will be far harder because the centre and the left are split into more tribes with bigger divisions. The ones Labour will target are split over immigration, business, and whether Britain should be an open multicultural society or a closed, ethnically homogenous one. They are also divided geographically between those in Scotland, the urban north (more anti-immigration) and the metropolitan, more multicultural south.</p> <p>The tribes on the left include one we call Democratic Socialists (8%) who are very open to immigration and the single market but also want higher taxes on the wealthy and businesses. They are mostly ABC1s, living in urban areas in Scotland and Wales. Then there is the Community tribe (5%) \u2013 mainly working-class voters in northern England and the Midlands \u2013 who agree on the need for income redistribution through the tax system but strongly disagree with the Democratic Socialists about immigration, wanting strict curbs.</p> <p>Another tribe, the Progressives (11%), are professionals from across the country, who share the Democratic Socialists\u2019 openness to immigration and the single market but are much more pro-business.</p> <p>In the 1990s, it was possible to put together a coalition of these tribes on the left and centre-left and win over enough in the Swing Voter tribe (7%) to form an election-winning majority, as Tony Blair did. But we now live in a world in which views on immigration have polarised and many in the north feel left behind and threatened by multiculturalism and globalisation, while more in the south embrace both.</p> <p>The left is divided not just from the right, but among its composite parts. From our findings \u2013 6% of the population did not fall easily into a \u201ctribe\u201d \u2013 it will be a lot easier to form a winning majority of centre-right and rightwing tribes than centre-left and leftwing ones. So, despite facing the most daunting inbox of any prime minister for decades, our poll is good news for Theresa May but far less promising for whoever takes Labour into the next general election.</p> <p><em>Adam Drummond is research manager and partner at Opinium</em></p>",
  "<p>European leaders will <a href=\"https://euobserver.com/institutional/134931\" title=\"\">meet in Bratislava</a> next Friday at an informal summit intended to map a new path for the EU in the wake of Britain\u2019s vote to leave. Yet while the unwelcome outcome of June\u2019s referendum was a trigger for the talks, this review, or re-evaluation, of the European project is long overdue. Modern-day Europe faces enormous challenges not remotely envisaged by the EU\u2019s founding fathers when they signed the Treaty of Rome 60 years ago next year. A new consensus on how to address these shared problems, in principle and in practice, is urgently needed as the treaty anniversary approaches.</p> <p>Britain, unfortunately, will have little or no say over what happens next. Theresa May is not invited to Bratislava. The summit will take place without her. The government is not being asked for it views on the crucial issues confronting Europe and, if it chooses to air them, it is increasingly likely, as time goes by, that it will be ignored. The EU wants only one thing from Britain right now, as Donald Tusk, the European council president,<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/08/donald-tusk-tells-theresa-may-the-ball-is-in-your-court-as-he-ur/\" title=\"\"> reminded May last week</a>: a firm date for starting exit negotiations. And this, unfortunately again, May is unwilling or unable to give them. To pretend the outcome of Bratislava and ensuing discussions will not have a big impact on British interests is to perpetuate the wilful blindness that led to the calamitous Brexit vote. A major struggle, years in the making, is coming to a head. It pits the \u201cold\u201d liberal, open-markets, open-borders EU, led by Germany, France and Italy, against the \u201cnew\u201d, conservative, nationalist EU, states such as <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/future-eu/news/visegrad-group-to-table-proposals-at-bratislava-summit/\" title=\"\">Poland, Hungary and Slovakia</a> that are more recent entrants. At issue is the future of the EU\u2019s so-called four freedoms \u2013 the free movement of labour, goods, services and capital.</p> <p>Claiming to be responding to public concerns about immigration, Islamist terrorism, economic security and the erosion of cultural traditions, the Poles and their allies in the <a href=\"http://www.visegradgroup.eu/about\" title=\"\">Visegr\u00e1d</a> group are resisting the migrant quota system championed by Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel. They want greater autonomy for national parliaments, more oversight of transnational corporations and investment, the scrapping of plans for visa-free EU travel for Turks, and greater recognition of what Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary\u2019s rightwing prime minister, calls \u201chistoric, religious and national identity\u201d.</p> <p>These objectives are shared by advancing, populist and nationalist movements across western Europe, too, including the Alternative for Germany (AfD), which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/mecklenburg-vorpommern-german-anti-immigrant-party-strong-regional-election-exit-polls-merkel\" title=\"\">humiliated Merkel</a> in elections in her home state last week. And if this agenda sounds familiar, it is. It echoes many of the positions adopted by Leave campaigners and their Ukip allies. How all these issues are tackled really matters for Britain. The irony is, if they had not cut and run, the views espoused by Michael Gove and Boris Johnson would have had much more influence in reshaping Europe\u2019s aims and priorities at this moment. As it is, they, and Britain, have no say.</p> <p>The Bratislava 27 face other tests. One is what to do about the eurozone\u2019s problems, mushrooming national deficits and the widening gap between the wealthier north and poorer south. Yet it is foolish to separate broader, pan-European post-crash worries, such as high youth unemployment and reduced foreign investment, from problems in the global economy, such as lower demand in China. Britain shares these problems. And it continues to have a strong interest in a prosperous, thriving European trading bloc of 500 million consumers, purchasers of 44% of UK exports in 2014. But in this area, too, Britain will have no voice and no say.</p> <p>Agreeing on the need to reform and revive the EU, Bratislava will consider a range of other proposals, including more rather than less integration and, for example, strengthening <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/08/european-union-plans-military-battlegroups-after-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">EU defence and security policy</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s time to move forward to a European defence union, which is basically a \u2018Schengen of defence\u2019,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/news/german-minister-in-lithuania-backs-european-defence-union/\" title=\"\">Ursula von der Leyen</a>, the German defence minister, while visiting Lithuania last week. Such statements of intent must ring alarm bells in Whitehall. As the EU\u2019s heaviest hitter on defence, Britain habitually took the lead, prioritising Nato and pouring cold water on previous, often French-inspired EU co-operation initiatives. But soon, London will have no say at all.</p> <p>What price now the Brexiters\u2019 repeated assurances that breaking with the EU would not undermine Nato and Britain\u2019s defences? How will this dismaying abdication of responsibility play with Washington? And how Vladimir Putin must be laughing, as he continues Russia\u2019s military build-up along Europe\u2019s Baltic frontier. May and her ministers have no answers. No summit, no comment.</p>",

A review of the political landscape after the referendum\u201d<em>,</em> not only shows those identifying themselves as on the right to be more numerous, but also demonstrates that they are more united in their views on the most burning political issues \u2013 including immigration and Brexit \u2013 than those on the centre and left.</p> <p>Ominously for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Corbyn</a>, the polling, to be released on Wednesday before the party conference season, found that while 77% of voters place themselves as somewhere near the political centre (centre left, centre or centre right), only 20% believe the Labour leader occupies any of that territory, with 47% regarding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/jeremy-corbyn-claims-he-can-unite-labour-to-take-on-tories\">Corbyn</a> as solidly leftwing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/spectrum-zip/giv-226015ltLtodyEldS/\" data-alt=\"A new electorate\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/spectrum-zip/giv-226015ltLtodyEldS/\">A new electorate</a> </figure>  <p>By contrast, Theresa May is seen as on, or close to, the centre ground by 43% of voters, and is described as rightwing by only 28%. After two months as prime minister, May is also viewed as marginally to the left of David Cameron (who styled himself as a centre-ground, modernising Conservative). Her chancellor, Philip Hammond, is also regarded as less rightwing than his predecessor, George Osborne.</p> <p>Even on the controversial issue of expanding the number of grammar schools, May can take cheer from the polling, with 38% of all those questioned saying they supported the policy, against 21% who opposed it.</p> <p>While the findings are not encouraging for Corbyn and will be little more so for his challenger <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/jeremy-corybn-labour-party-leadership-vote-election-owen-smith\">Owen Smith</a>, who is mounting his challenge from a broadly leftwing platform, they also show the difficulty that any alternative Labour leader would have in trying to build a broad coalition capable of winning elections again.</p> <p>Emran Mian, the director of the Social Market Foundation, said of the findings: \u201cOur polling and analysis highlights the problems facing Labour \u2013 not only is the broad centre-left and left smaller than the broad right, its constituent groups diverge on key issues like immigration and internationalism.\u201d</p> <p>The groups that Labour would need to bring together are split on policy and divided geographically, with the party\u2019s target voters in working-class areas of the north and the Midlands having different worldviews to those in predominantly metropolitan southern areas.</p> <p>Mian added: \u201cThe last time an enduring, successful electoral coalition was assembled from the centre-left was before the increase in immigration which took place in the mid-2000s, and one wonders whether another can be put together while the issue of immigration retains its current salience.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/observer-opinium-politics-polls\">By asking detailed questions on policy as well as identifying how voters see themselves, Opinium has identified eight \u201ctribes\u201d of voters. </a> It placed 50% of the electorate in two tribes on the right (called Common Sense and Our Britain). With this support alone, its joint report with the thinktank says, the Tories could \u201caim for the 40% to 42% of the vote, which normally guarantees a healthy majority under our electoral system\u201d.</p> <p>But outside these two tribes \u2013 including, crucially, among potential floating voters on the centre ground and left \u2013 it found divergent views on everything from taxation to Europe, the future of the welfare state and equality. Another group identified as Progressives accounts for 11% of voters and is defined as a \u201cscattering of professionals from across the UK\u201d. They are comfortable with immigration, believe in the welfare state and would have to be courted as part of any centre-left coalition of interests. But the Progressives are at odds with another group defined as being to their left and entitled Community. This group is described as mainly made up of working-class voters from the north and Midlands who are sceptical of business and capitalism and are in many cases not internationalists.</p> <p>The report, to be launched at a cross-party event attended by the Liberal Democrat former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, the Tory former education secretary Nicky Morgan and Labour\u2019s Chuka Umunna on Wednesday, says the number of diffuse groupings on the left and centre left reflects Labour\u2019s huge electoral challenge.</p> <p>\u201cThe groups ... are smaller in aggregate terms and are more fissiparous [than those on the right]. In particular, the groups on the left are split in relation to immigration, with the Solidarity group of older and poorer voters at odds with the Progressives and Democratic Socialists.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/does-the-left-have-a-future\">Does the left have a future? | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Umunna, a former shadow cabinet member, said of the poll findings: \u201cThey show that under the first-past-the-post system, if you want a left-of-centre government, then Labour is the only answer \u2013 but we can only achieve that by building a broad-based coalition spanning from the centre to the centre left. This work shows why if we reduce the party\u2019s appeal down to a narrow left spectrum, we are doomed to failure and will be unable to make real our Labour values in office. Labour leaders through from Clement Attlee to Ed Miliband realised this.\u201d</p> <p>Opinium, which conducted its survey among a sample of more than 2,000 people in mid-August, found opinion on Brexit had not shifted at all since referendum night, with 52% backing leaving the EU and 48% wanting to remain.</p> <p>The report adds: \u201cThe centre is not dead, not rhetorically anyway. People are still more likely to identify with the centre ground than one of the wings in politics. This suggests that there is a dividend to be gained from identifying as a centrist. \u201cBut what should a centrist politician do in order to sustain the support of voters? From our analysis of the tribes, it is easier to hold together a winning coalition, broadly speaking, on the right or centre-right than on the left.\u201d</p> <p>With Labour struggling to chart a way forward, leading figures from the Liberal Democrats, Greens and Labour, including the Green MP Caroline Lucas, Labour\u2019s Lisa Nandy and the Lib Dem leader Tim Farron, published a book last week, <em>The Alternative</em>, calling for a wider \u201crealignment of minds\u201d and co-operation between progressive parties to take on the Tories.</p> <p>Its editor, Chris Bowers, said: \u201cThe more we can seek common ground across the progressive spectrum, the more it could defuse some of Labour\u2019s problems. If we can forge a broad progressive movement with clear but respectful liberal, green, social-democratic and socialist voices, we can celebrate the differences rather than see them as a drawback.</p> <p>\u201cThe old certainties have gone now, the 2015 election and 2016 referendum results mean we have to see voters through new eyes, and only a willingness to explore new ways of working together will stop the Conservatives having a clear run at the next election.\u201d</p>",

In Athens \u2013 on the frontline of Europe\u2019s worst refugee crisis since the second world war \u2013 it is a holding pen for innocents whose conditions, in the words of a scathing report issued by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/09/conditions-for-greeces-migrant-children-shocking-says-human-rights-watch\">Human Rights Watch</a> on Friday, is not only deplorable but should never exist. Greek authorities call it a \u201cspecial place for the accommodation of foreigners\u201d, part of a chain of closed facilities available to some of the 3,464 migrant children registered nationwide. As a measure of last resort, minors, they say, are placed in such institutions for lack of viable alternatives and for their own protection.</p> <p>Under the watchful gaze of the guards, their eyes darting this way and that, the detainees \u2013 all boys from countries that, on our visit, include Algeria, Syria, Tunisia, Pakistan and Iraq \u2013 prefer to watch their words. This is not where any of them intended to be. Each, in his own way, shares the common story of dodging bullets and worse to get to Europe \u2013 the imagined utopia at the end of a journey sometimes triggered by the need to flee poverty but, more often than not, persecution and war.</p> <p>That they have got here at all, in conditions that adults might find hard to survive, past smugglers and criminal gangs is, in itself, a story of courage and resolve. Some start out alone but just as many lose their families in shipwrecks and other tragedies along the way. \u201cNone of us want to be here,\u201d says Ahmed Kamshle, a 14-year-old Syrian brandishing his papers. \u201cAnd some of us have been here for a very long time.

In Greece, in Amygdaleza, in detention centres and police holding cells up and down the country, it is these children \u2013 by far the most vulnerable of the more than a million migrants to have crossed Greek borders \u2013 who have been forgotten.</p> <p>For the Greek state \u2013 in barely disguised meltdown after six years of economic freefall \u2013 the minors are an embarrassment but also a glitch. Faced with a chronic shortage of space, its island camps brimming, its shelters practically nonexistent, its asylum-seeking system stretched to breaking point, its reaction has been to deal with the children as if they don\u2019t exist.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is no one sees them,\u201d says Sofia Kouvelaki at the Bodossaki Foundation, a philanthropic organisation now prioritising the minors\u2019 plight. \u201cAnd by failing to recognise them for what they are, as the most vulnerable among the migrant flows [into the EU], they have been marginalised to the point of invisibility.\u201d</p> <p>It is a fool\u2019s game. One that starts with violence, she says, but will beget violence, too. \u201cIt is a circle of violence. They start off fleeing it, then they experience it once they get here and at some point they will express it,\u201d she sighs. \u201cBecause who, after all, is going to deal with their anger and despair?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5294dd90f73e4bb8a660a3aabe2cffda0e16cb2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5294dd90f73e4bb8a660a3aabe2cffda0e16cb2b/0_245_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The boys in Amygdaleza camp are kept behind fences and watched over by guards\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The boys in Amygdaleza camp are kept behind fences and watched over by guards</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sofia Kouvelaki</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What NGOs, charities, psychologists and social workers are discovering is that the flipside of grit, the mirror image of courage and resolve, is a vulnerability both destructive and brittle. \u201cPsychologically they have huge problems; they self-harm, they cut themselves up, they use their hands and arms as weapons,\u201d says Tzanetos Antypas, who heads Greece\u2019s biggest humanitarian organisation, Praksis.</p> <p>A social worker-cum-academic with vast experience handling those worst affected by the country\u2019s near-economic collapse, Antypas finds it hard to hide his own emotion when he recounts what he has witnessed.</p> <p>Unaccompanied minors involved earlier this year in a revolt at the closed reception centre on Lesbos \u2013 the Aegean island that has borne the brunt of the migrant influx \u2013 emerged with shocking disabilities. \u201cMany had been kept in custody for as long as 100 days, four times longer than the time allowed legally,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThere were some, I\u2019m not kidding, whose hair had turned white. When we moved them to an open camp they chose to remain listless in their tents. After so many months incarcerated in such overcrowded conditions, I was told they had forgotten how to walk.\u201d</p> <p>Antypas, like Kouvelaki, is one of the heroes in this drama. Bodossaki, a privately run foundation, and Praksis, with more than 2,000 volunteers nationwide, have no desire to replace the state. But what is certain is that they are supplementing it in ways both vital and clear. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the charitable foundations and NGOs things would be very difficult,\u201d admits Lefteris Papagiannakis, Athens\u2019 vice-mayor on migrant and refugee affairs. \u201cThey\u2019ve been crucial in these very hard times.\u201d</p> <p>All agree that the story is as much about numbers as anything else. With only two state-run shelters \u2013 in Athens and on Crete \u2013 and 33 run by NGOs and other organisations, around 1,530 unaccompanied minors have formally been placed in accommodation. The rest are either housed with adults in camps or left to fend for themselves, with many resorting to sex for survival. \u201cWe need around 400 more shelters,\u201d says Antypas. \u201cAnd we need to do it fast.\u201d</p> <p>Among the lucky few are those who have found shelter with the Society for the Care of Minors in a neoclassical house in Athens\u2019 Exarcheia district. The 18 wards, mostly from Pakistan but also Afghanistan and Syria, banter and play as teenagers do. There are games and warm food and a couple who play \u201cmama and papa\u201d to the children.</p> <p>\u201cI love Greece,\u201d says Rafiullah from Afghanistan. \u201cThey have been very good to me. Soon I will be reunited with my uncle in the Netherlands.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the summer, organisations such as Bodossaki have worked to create shelters, with 18 children moving into a colourful house in a central Athens neighbourhood last month.</p> <p>In an ideal world, the minors would be transferred rapidly to other EU countries through relocation and family reunification schemes. \u201cBut what is most important,\u201d says Kouvelaki, \u201cis that these children are allowed to be what they are \u2013 children \u2013 again.\u201d</p>",

A <a href=\"http://www.traffic.org/home/2016/8/31/new-surveys-find-significant-though-declined-uk-antiques-ivo.html\">recent report</a> by the NGO Traffic found that the antiques ivory market in the UK appeared to have declined significantly, though there are still thousands of ivory items on sale in London\u2019s markets.</p> <p>Even though the international trade in ivory has been banned for more than 25 years, a flourishing black market has led to the slaughter of elephants, as well as the people charged with protecting them.</p> <p>A separate IUCN motion to protect 30% of the world\u2019s oceans was agreed with little dispute.

They include a call for a ban on gillnet fishing, which threatens the vaquita porpoise in Mexico, and restrictions on the trade of pangolins. Other motions backed the adoption of renewable energy and energy efficiency by countries. Voting was conducted online prior to the IUCN congress.</p>",
  "<p>Every major film festival is essentially an island \u2013 or at least its own self-enclosed microclimate \u2013 and the fact that the Lido literally is an island can sometimes make the Venice film festival seem entirely cut off from the outside world.</p> <p>This year, however, Venice felt like an integral part of the flow of the bigger universe.

Noah Oppenheim\u2019s script presents her story through that time-honoured device of a press interview (Billy Crudup is very good as the journalist), with Jackie talking us through the events in Dallas, her famous <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUP9gY_5MzI\">1962 TV tour of the White House</a>, and the shock of simultaneously losing a husband and her first lady status. The moment at which Lyndon Johnson is inaugurated, suddenly leaving Jackie an isolated figure on the sidelines, is magnificently poignant. Portman has never quite seemed a heavyweight player before now \u2013 I wasn\u2019t convinced by her in her other Venice feature, eccentric French period piece <em>Planetarium</em> \u2013 but in <em>Jackie</em> she gives an authoritatively nuanced performance.

  "<p>The career of Jim Sheridan is something of an oddity. In Ireland, his work has been universally lauded, from Oscar-winning debut My Left Foot to powerful IRA drama In the Name of the Father. He then dipped his toe into the US with immigration tale In America, a film that still retained a strong Irish narrative, and also led to more awards glory. </p> <p>But since then, he\u2019s shaken off his homeland and the results have gone from underwhelming to disastrous. There was the vapid 50 Cent vehicle Get Rich or Die Tryin\u2019, the entirely unnecessary remake of Susanne Bier\u2019s Brothers and the staggeringly bad Daniel Craig thriller Dream House. It\u2019s perhaps understandable that he\u2019s eager to return to the country where he\u2019s most loved, but regrettably, his latest film isn\u2019t quite the comeback many might have hoped for. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/13/vanessa-redgrave-interview-simon-hattenstone\">Vanessa Redgrave on why she was ready to die: \u2018Trying to live was getting too tiring\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On paper, The Secret Scripture seems like a doozy. It\u2019s based on an acclaimed novel by Sebastian Barry that was shortlisted for the Man Booker prize. It focuses on a painful time in Irish history and recruits an impressive cast of established and promising actors. Vanessa Redgrave plays Rose, a woman who\u2019s been living in a decrepit, soon-to-be demolished mental health hospital for 50 years. She\u2019s been keeping a secret diary of her time there and when a psychiatrist, played by Eric Bana, is called in to assess her condition, she relives the circumstances that led her there.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/nov/30/carol-forget-cate-blanchett-and-look-at-rooney-maras-beatnik-style\">Rooney Mara</a> plays the young Rose whose arrival in a small village in 1940s Ireland causes two men, a fighter pilot and a priest, played by Jack Reynor and Theo James, to develop feelings for her. But the strict community soon turns against her and a chain of tragic events leads to a devastating injustice.</p> <p>The rich dramatic material at play and the fascinating historical backdrop means there\u2019s plenty here that proves initially appealing. The young Rose is trapped by her sexuality, arousing interest in men without the slightest provocation on her part yet facing the full force of blame from those around her. The film briefly explores the complicated rituals of dating at the time and the dangers of a bruised male ego when a woman dares to turn a man down. </p> <p>Mara is a compelling actor, her face always hinting at hidden depths, no matter how shallow the material around her might be. But here, that only goes so far as the script, co-written by Sheridan, gives her very little to work with. Young Rose, initially feisty, becomes an unknowable non-entity. We never truly understand her and Mara quickly becomes visibly bored. She also seems annoyed by the other two attractive yet bland participants in her love triangle, both also stuck playing ciphers.</p> <p>Sheridan\u2019s take on the material is solidly made but sorely lacking in subtlety. As integral as it might be to the source novel, the repeated use of Beethoven\u2019s Moonlight Sonata only serves to show how unoriginal the whole venture feels. It\u2019s also a desperate attempt to wring some emotion out of what should feel like a heartbreaking story yet it suffers in comparison to films such as The Magdalene Sisters and Philomena. </p> <p>But where the film really falls apart is in the last stretch, where an unlikely, frustratingly silly narrative revelation arrives, one that was unpopular with literary critics at the time of the book\u2019s release. It\u2019s daytime soap-level stuff and even Redgrave, who convinces throughout, fails to sell the final few far-fetched scenes. </p> <p>Sheridan has developed a number of bad habits during his time in the US, and Hollywood sentimentality is clearly the most egregious (the film ends with a song by Kelly Clarkson). The Secret Scripture is sadly not the return to form it could have been and will likely stay a secret to most of the cinema-going public.</p>",

  "<p>Oliver Stone has taken aim at the US government for deceiving people about the levels of surveillance that exist in the country.</p> <p>The Oscar-winning director was speaking at the Toronto film festival as his new film Snowden, about the controversial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/star-treks-zachary-quinto-calls-for-return-of-edward-snowden\">NSA informant Edward Snowden</a>, received its world premiere.

This story not only deals with eavesdropping but mass eavesdropping, drones and cyberwarfare. As Snowden said himself the other day, \u2018It\u2019s out of control, the world is out of control.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The film also features a cameo from Snowden himself, who still resides at an undisclosed location in Russia while he searches for asylum elsewhere. Stone hopes that he may return to US ground but is doubtful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/10/snowden-review-oliver-stone-turns-true-thrills-into-dated-hollywood-fodder\">Snowden review: Oliver Stone turns true thrills into dated Hollywood fodder</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cObama could pardon him and we hope so,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he has vigorously prosecuted eight whistleblowers under the espionage act, which is an all-time record for an American president, and he\u2019s been one of the most efficient managers of this surveillance world. It is the most extensive and invasive surveillance state that has ever existed and he\u2019s built it up.\u201d</p> <p>The film-maker, known for the politically charged dramas Nixon and JFK, finds the current situation, which he likens to a George Orwell novel, to be at odds with the world that he grew up in.</p> <p>\u201cI grew up in a world where I never thought this could happen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut from 2001 on, it\u2019s very clear that something radical has changed. There\u2019s more to it that meets the eye and whatever they tell you, you\u2019ve got to look beyond.\u201d</p> <p>Gordon-Levitt met with the real Snowden in preparation for the film and believes that it\u2019s his love of America that led him to leak classified information.</p> <p>\u201cI was interested in his patriotism,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was doing what he did out of a sincere love for his country and the principles that the country is founded on. There are two different types of patriotism: there\u2019s the kind when you\u2019re allegiant to your country no matter what and you don\u2019t ask any questions, but there\u2019s another type which I really wanted to show in this character. The privilege of being from a free country like the US is that we are allowed to ask those questions and to hold the government accountable.\u201d</p> <p>When asked about Snowden\u2019s future, Gordon-Levitt said: \u201cI know he would love to come home and I hope for that.\u201d</p> <p>The film has premiered to mixed reviews at the festival, with Variety\u2019s Owen Gleiberman calling it \u201cthe most important and galvanising political drama by an American film-maker in years\u201d yet the Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Stephen Farber labelled it \u201ca lackluster opus\u201d.</p>",

We have no idea what the rules will be.\u201d</p> <p>Peers said the only guarantee that British citizens would not be subject to any future EU ESTA-style system and instead would still be able, for example, to use fast-track channels at EU airports would be if the government negotiated a deal similar enough to Norway\u2019s or Switzerland\u2019s to satisfy Brussels on free movement.</p> <p>British residents made more than 30m holiday trips to EU countries last year, according to the Office for National Statistics, with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jan/27/terrorism-fears-see-uk-tourists-opting-for-safer-holiday-destinations\">Spain (13m visits)</a> and France (8.8m) the most popular destinations.</p> <p>The EU plan is part of series of measures planned in the wake of the Paris attacks in January and November last year and the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/brussels-attacks\">Brussels airport and metro bombings in March this year</a>, which exposed serious failings in the EU\u2019s external and internal border security systems.</p> <p>The plan for a European ESTA was first outlined in 2011.

Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland have signed Schengen association agreements.</p> <p>The British government has given no clear indication of the form its preferred Brexit model will take, but appears to be aiming for a bespoke agreement that would give it control over EU immigration, possibly at the expense of single market membership, rather than a deal based on that of Norway and Switzerland.</p> <p>Negotiations with the EU are likely to be long and tough, with European leaders repeatedly stressing that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/04/uk-could-access-single-market-suggests-french-presidential-favourite-alain-juppe\">privileged access to the EU\u2019s single market</a> will not be on offer unless Britain accepts the fundamental principle of free movement.</p> <p>Britain has also so far <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/04/future-of-eu-nationals-in-uk-uncertain-may-comments-tory-leadership-brexit\">refused to guarantee the residence</a> and other rights of EU citizens already in Britain unless it receives assurances from the EU on the status of British nationals on the continent.</p> <p>Mortera-Martinez said Etias \u201cmay be some time coming\u201d and stressed that that in practice Britain\u2019s future deal with the EU would almost certainly include some form of provision for free travel \u2013 as opposed to the right to live and work \u2013 on the continent. But the free travel question will be one of many bargaining chips.</p> <p>\u201cBritain is a neighbouring country, it is a safe country, this would be very bad for business and there would always be a possibility of retaliation,\u201d Mortera-Martinez said. \u201cBut this question will have to be dealt with.

  "<p>Please don\u2019t call it Has-Ben. </p> <p>The big-screen remake of Ben-Hur is the 2016 blockbuster season\u2019s biggest disappointment, with losses <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ben-hur-faces-120m-loss-925302\">projected</a> to reach $120m. The film had a $100m production budget, and studios usually dole out at least half production for marketing \u2013 and often more in the case of would-be hits like Ben-Hur. It\u2019s a bad moment to be an accountant at MGM.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t always thus: Ben-Hur was once one of Hollywood\u2019s most reliable chariot-pullers, with no fewer than five adaptations since 1907 \u2013 two are preserved in the US Library of Congress. The 1880 novel, written by civil war general Lew Wallace, has been adapted into a four-hour TV miniseries by ABC, a Broadway play of similar length, and no fewer than four theatrical films, including the 1959 classic with its notoriously dangerous chariot races.</p> <p>Wallace\u2019s book was the first work of fiction to be blessed by a pope, Leo XIII, and Wallace decided that for religious reasons no one should adapt it. After nine years of promises that they would do it justice, enterprising theater producers turned his head. With an initial, immensely popular stage production, the novel was off to the races, as it were.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0e6e9a6e02cc26724bd201d4ca8d5f65e4fb6ad1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e6e9a6e02cc26724bd201d4ca8d5f65e4fb6ad1/0_0_913_1398/653.jpg\" alt=\"A poster for the original theatrical production of Ben-Hur, adapted by William Young\" width=\"653\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben-Hur on Broadway.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Strobridge Lithography Company: Cincinnati and New York/Wikimedia commons</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Ben Hur (1907)</strong></h2> <p>Director: Sidney Olcott<br>Production budget: $500, adjusted to $12,851 in 2016<br>Eventual court settlement: $25,000, adjusted to $642,589 in 2016</p> <p>At 15 minutes long, the film is certainly the shortest adaptation of the novel\u2019s hundreds of pages; in terms of film history, though, it might be even more significant than the 1959 classic because it created the concept of movie rights. </p> <p>An elaborate play version had been a success in 1899, possibly because the spectacle had included horses on treadmills and the producing Kalem Company worked hard to replicate it, even featuring actors from the 1890 cast of the play. Wallace had died two years before the film\u2019s release, but his publisher, Harper &amp; Brothers, still held the rights to the book. The company sued the film-makers, who had simply shot their favorite scenes from the book.</p> <p>Box office records for the film weren\u2019t available, but the film\u2019s success made an impression: the resulting infringement suit went <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/222/55/case.html\">to the supreme court</a>. The result, a landmark 1911 ruling, created contemporary copyright standards when the justices said that film-makers needed permission to adapt works under copyright. Films weren\u2019t taken particularly seriously at the time, but the justices said that the film\u2019s advertisement had relied on the book\u2019s success and its makers were wrong to have hitched a ride on Wallace\u2019s coattails. </p> <p>Kalem had to pay Harper a hefty $25,000, according to Kevin Brownlow\u2019s history of silent film, The Parade\u2019s Gone By. Director Sidney Olcott went on to film the world\u2019s first five-reel movie, From the Manger to the Cross, in Palestine the next year.</p> <p>Appropriately, both the 1907 film and novel are now in the public domain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The original film version of Ben Hur from 1911 directed by Sidney Olcott, hosted at Archive.org\">  <iframe src=\"https://archive.org/embed/SidneyOlcottsBen-hur1905\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The original film version of Ben Hur from 1911 directed by Sidney Olcott, hosted at Archive.org</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)</strong></h2> <p>Production budget: $3m, adjusted to $41.2m in 2016<br>Box office gross: $9m, adjusted to $123.8m in 2016</p> <p>William Young\u2019s six-act stage adaptation of Ben-Hur finally wore out its welcome in 1917, with a sixth and final run on Broadway.

The film was the second-highest grossing feature of the year behind King Vidor\u2019s The Big Parade. The film-makers paid $600,000 for the rights this time around, in addition to fees to build some 30 ships for the pitched naval battle sequences.</p> <p>The film shot in Rome under its Hollywood-friendly ruler, Benito Mussolini. The fascist leader extended every courtesy and they returned the favor \u2013 \u201cMussolini was much admired in Hollywood,\u201d Brownlow writes \u2013 until the dictator learned of the vast discrepancy between pay rates for Hollywood stagehands and his country\u2019s own carpenters.

So, after a few years\u2019 hiatus, the intoxicating rivalry resumes, amid breathless hype, re-scratching of old wounds, ancient enmities, and a grudging resentment from fans of other clubs at the obsession over this one fixture at the expense of anything and everything else. But enough about Guardiola v Mourinho and the Manchester derby, for the Old Firm rivalry is back! back! back!</p> <p>Not that it ever really went away, of course, with the circumstances of Rangers\u2019 reconstitution becoming a kind of proxy battleground for all the old hostility. So Rangers are either back in their rightful place after being vengefully dumped on by the rest of Scottish football (not helped by their own internal boardroom strife), or an entirely new club, given a leg-up by dint of historic reputation and institutional bias. Whatever your views, CORRESPONDENCE ON THIS SUBJECT IS CLOSED.</p> <p>Let\u2019s talk about the football. There\u2019s no doubt that Celtic are the favourites on paper, their unchallenged domestic dominance over the past five years giving them an in-built advantage. In theory anyway. The well-received appointment of Brendan Rodgers has brightened the mood at Parkhead and they\u2019ve won all three of their league games this season. The contrast in status is illustrated by the fact that while this is undoubtedly Rangers\u2019 biggest game of the season so far, it\u2019s not even Celtic\u2019s biggest this week \u2013 Tuesday\u2019s Big Cup damage-limitation exercise in Barcelona will undoubtedly be on Parkhead minds. And while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/scottish-premiership/table\">top of the early-season table</a> may look like any other Scottish top flight table from the past 100 years, Rangers have not been mightily convincing in nestling in behind Celtic in second place.</p> <p>However, Marc Warburton is a smart manager and his side were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/17/celtic-rangers-scottish-cup-semi-final-match-report\">deserved winners of the most recent derby</a>, last year\u2019s Scottish Cup semi-final, and then played their part in arguably the most raucously entertaining major domestic match played in Britain last season, the Scottish Cup final defeat to Hibs, even if the aftermath was a tad ugly. They will provide a stern test for Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side, whose aptitude in pressure situations remains unproven, given the dreadful performance in Israel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/23/hapoel-beer-sheva-celtic-champions-league-qualifier-match-report\">against Hapoel Beer-Sheva</a> that almost turfed them out of the Champions League.</p> <p>There\u2019s some interesting team speculation to chew over too \u2013 will Leigh Griffiths be fit? How will the much-trailed Scott Brown v Joey Barton midfield square-up pan out? Will Joe Garner, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sek8FbRQKw0\">a striker with an eye for a spectacular finish</a>, get a start for Rangers? Neither side looks entirely convincing at the back so we might expect goals today. May football be the winner, whatever happens. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-10T09:43:43.572Z\">at 10.43am BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<h2><strong>Best team that won\u2019t make the playoffs</strong></h2> <p>The <strong>Buccaneers</strong>. Jameis Winston, Doug Martin and Mike Evans give the Bucs a young and dynamic offense, but the rebuilding defense and having to play in a division with the Panthers will likely keep Tampa Bay on the outside looking in (for one more year). <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>The<strong> Raiders</strong> are on the rise with a talented young quarterback and speedy receiver to go with some promising defensive players. By season\u2019s end Oakland will be knocking on the door of the postseason. They will come up just short this time. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>I suspect it will come from the AFC West, whose four teams all have enough quality to win the division, but also enough flaws to sink to last place. I\u2019ll take a better-than-expected <strong>San Diego Chargers </strong>team to narrowly miss out despite a renaissance year from Philip Rivers. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>The<strong> Bengals </strong>have made the postseason for five straight years and have demonstrated steady growth in building through the draft even if they don\u2019t have the playoff results to show for it. But despite offensive and defensive lines that rate among the NFL\u2019s best, they\u2019ll be odd men out in the annual wild-card logjam. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Non-playoff team from last year that will make the playoffs</strong></h2> <p>The <strong>Indianapolis </strong><strong>Colts.</strong> Not because the Colts will be appreciably better this year than last or because Andrew Luck will finally reach his supposed Hall of Fame potential. It\u2019s just that some team has to win the AFC South and the Colts are mediocre enough do it. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Last season was a disaster of the <strong>Baltimore Ravens</strong> who have been one of the league\u2019s more stable franchises since moving to the east coast. They are healthy again after a year of injuries to key players, including quarterback Joe Flacco. They lost close games last year that they won\u2019t drop this time around. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Oakland Raiders</strong>. For all the focus on Derek Carr and Amari Cooper\u2019s improvement, the Raiders\u2019 biggest gains could be on defense \u2013 with the additions of Bruce Irvin and Sean Smith. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>With a healthy Andrew Luck back under center, the <strong>Colts</strong> will deliver on last year\u2019s dashed hopes. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Team you\u2019re looking forward most to watching</strong></h2> <p>A full season with Tyrod Taylor, Sammy Watkins and LeSean McCoy together in <strong>Buffalo</strong> promises a lot of excitement. And when you throw in the entertainment provided by the Ryan brothers on the sideline, there\u2019s no other choice. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>No team is more intriguing than <strong>Denver</strong> in the season after their Super Bowl win. The Broncos still have what might be the league\u2019s best defense but they lost quarterbacks Peyton Manning to retirement and Brock Osweiler to free agency. Defensively they have the ability to win another title, but offensively they might be lost. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>I think some people are getting a little carried away with their expectations for Dak Prescott, but how could you not be fascinated by the prospect of him pairing up with Ezekiel Elliott in an all-rookie backfield for <strong>Dallas</strong>? <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>A Super Bowl loss won\u2019t keep the Panthers from talking loudly, dancing freely and celebrating without restraint. They\u2019re just what the stolid NFL needs. That alone makes them destination viewing, say nothing of the fact that Cam Newton has yet to peak. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Most valuable player</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a64c6eb85a703fc51d0af6e0967d6ee7cfc048a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a64c6eb85a703fc51d0af6e0967d6ee7cfc048a/0_28_3348_2008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russell Wilson excelled down the stretch last season\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russell Wilson excelled down the stretch last season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Habeeb/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tom Brady</strong> lost his battle with Roger Goodell, but he\u2019ll probably get the MVP as a consolation prize. The Patriots offense will make a big improvement after four games and everyone will hit upon the notion that Brady is rather valuable. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Because the Seahawks struggled so much early last season it\u2019s easy to forget just how great<strong> </strong><strong>Russell Wilson</strong> was in the second half of the campaign when Seattle changed their offense. If he is anything like the player he was in November and December 2015 he will be the league\u2019s best player. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p><strong>Rob Gronkowski</strong>, the man who will make sure that the Pats\u2019 offense keeps ticking even with Jimmy Garoppolo under center. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p><strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong>, the NFL\u2019s best quarterback, will join his predecessor Brett Favre as a three-time MVP. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Johnny Manziel Disaster Waiting To Happen Dept</strong></h2> <p><strong>Johnny Manziel</strong>. Let\u2019s not too quickly overlook the reigning champ. With Tony Romo currently resting and preparing for his next injury, Dak Prescott a question mark and Mark Sanchez a known/disappointing commodity, Jerry Jones could be insane enough to sign Manziel before the season is out. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>In the first Houston Super Bowl since Janet Jackson\u2019s \u201cwardrobe malfunction\u201d the <strong>Patriots mascot</strong> will have his own \u201cwardrobe malfunction\u201d revealing a design to spy on opponents\u2019 huddles and steal their play calls. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>I fear that the <strong>Ryan brothers</strong>\u2019 collaboration in Buffalo cannot end well. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/17383705/rex-rob-ryan-plan-take-buffalo-bills-playoffs-first-16-years\">Rex has already gained 30lbs</a>, for a start \u2026 <strong>PB</strong></p> <p><strong>Roger Goodell</strong> resigns as commissioner in January to assume the office of Secretary of the Interior in Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>One bold prediction</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pittsburgh miss the playoffs</strong>. Do I think it will happen? No. Could it? Definitely. Everyone seems oddly high on a team with a suspect D that will be without Le\u2019Veon Bell, Martavis Bryant, Ladarius Green and Bud Dupree for all or part of the season. The Steelers are one Ben Roethlisberger or Antonio Brown injury away from disaster. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>The Cowboys will panic and chase a big-name broken-down quarterback ... oh, wait, you said a <em>bold</em> prediction. How about the <strong>Chargers and Raiders wind up staying in San Diego and Oakland</strong>? <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Despite the fact that he hasn\u2019t played a competitive game since 2014, and won\u2019t play his first of this season until October, I say <strong>Josh Gordon makes the Pro Bowl</strong>. Because if there\u2019s one thing RGIII definitely does have in his locker, it\u2019s the deep ball. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p><strong>Lamar Miller wins the NFL rushing title.</strong> Houston\u2019s new running back was used lightly in Miami, but the Texans will depend heavily on the 25-year-old as they break in a new quarterback. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Offensive player of the year</strong></h2> <p><strong>Antonio Brown</strong>. If Roethlisberger and Brown stay healthy, Brown will benefit from the absences of Le\u2019Veon Bell and Martavis Bryant by being targeted approximately infinity times per game in Todd Haley\u2019s pass-happy offense. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p><strong>Russell Wilson</strong>. Last season was the year of Cam Newton but with their defense falling back a bit the Panthers offense will too. This is the year people will be talking about Seattle\u2019s offense, not just their defense. It will be because of Wilson\u2019s play. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>I keep banging this drum, but <strong>Antonio Brown</strong> would have had a 2,000-yard season last year if it weren\u2019t for Michael Vick. Even when Landry Jones was his quarterback, he kept on producing. He\u2019s the best receiver in the league, and doesn\u2019t have Martavis Bryant to share the load this year, either. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p><strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong>\u2019 numbers will only swell with Jordy Nelson back in the fold. Look for the MVP to double up here. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Defensive player of the year</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"488c493e6ec303ae72d05c5910c727c25b164ed2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/488c493e6ec303ae72d05c5910c727c25b164ed2/0_61_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"JJ Watt could be toppled as defensive player of the year by Aaron Donald\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">JJ Watt could be toppled as defensive player of the year by Aaron Donald.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry W. Smith/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Aaron Donald</strong>. Donald arguably deserved this award last year, but finished second to noted football brand JJ Watt. With the young Rams defensive tackle now in a bigger media market and Watt opening the season hobbled, Donald will win. (And let\u2019s hope that\u2019s the only win by a Donald in 2016.) <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>The Rams won\u2019t be doing much this season but Los Angeles fans will have their first new big star in <strong>Aaron Donald</strong>, who is maybe as good as JJ Watt right now. How many interior defensive players have 20 sacks in their careers let alone their first two seasons? <strong>LC</strong></p> <p><strong>JJ Watt</strong>, as usual. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p><strong>Khalil Mack</strong>. Oakland\u2019s edge rusher was in the conversation for top defensive honors after a standout sophomore campaign. With an improved secondary and Bruce Irvin applying pressure from the opposite end, look for Mack to challenge the single-season sacks record in year three. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Rookie of the year</strong></h2> <p><strong>Ezekiel Elliott</strong>. He\u2019s the unquestioned RB1 for a team with quarterback issues and a dominant offensive line. If anyone else wins Offensive Rookie of the Year, it will be an upset. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>The easy choice would be to say <strong>Ezekiel Elliott</strong> who should pile up yards in the Cowboys backfield, but Dallas will stumble without Tony Romo and a great under-the-radar choice should be linebacker Myles Jack, who can fit beautifully in Jacksonville\u2019s system and could be part of a Jags renaissance. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p><strong>Ezekiel Elliott</strong> is going to have some fun behind that great offensive line in Dallas. <strong> PB</strong></p> <p>Tony Romo\u2019s injury means No4 overall pick <strong>Ezekiel Elliott</strong> will get even more touches behind the league\u2019s best offensive line as the Cowboys jump in a rookie quarterback. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>AFC East champion</strong></h2> <p><strong>Patriots</strong>. It\u2019s fun to think about all the ways Tom Brady\u2019s suspension <a href=\"http:// https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jul/19/tom-brady-deflategate-suspension-new-england-patriots-nfl\">could lead to New England\u2019s demise</a>, but it\u2019s hard to see them failing to win a division that features Ryan Fitzpatrick, the Ryan Brothers and the Miami Dolphins. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>With or without Tom Brady for every game, the division is <strong>New England</strong>\u2019s to lose. Miami may surprise, the Jets will make the race interesting, Buffalo has enough talent to make a run and will get a shot at the Brady-less Pats in September. In the end, though, The Patriots are the Patriots and Brady is Brady. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p><strong>Patriots</strong>. For once, I don\u2019t think this is a foregone conclusion. A month without Brady is no small thing, and if any other team in this division can make a fast start then things could certainly get interesting. I\u2019m just not sure who it would be. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>It says here New England is slow out of the gate with Tom Brady sidelined and the <strong>Buffalo </strong><strong>Bills</strong> hang on to win the division and host a playoff game for the first time in 20 years. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>AFC North champion</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"712fbdb67d828fa94a50fbe9ec0beed48c0efab3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/712fbdb67d828fa94a50fbe9ec0beed48c0efab3/0_0_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Antonio Brown could clock up 2,000 receiving yards this season\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Antonio Brown could clock up 2,000 receiving yards this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Steelers</strong>. As long as the Steelers don\u2019t suffer more significant injuries or suspensions, they should have enough to take the division \u2013 and send the Bengals to the wild-card round for their usual postseason demise. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>This is the trickiest of all divisions. Pittsburgh have the kind of offense that can put up huge scores and Baltimore will be better after an injury-filled 2015. Still, <strong>Cincinnati</strong> remains a difficult team to beat, with a good enough mix of a ball-control offense and an aggressive defense to win the title. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>I like the <strong>Steelers</strong> a lot this season - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/afc-north-pittsburgh-steelers-super-bowl\">but only if they can stay healthy</a>. Cincy will not be far behind, and on strength of coaching alone I expect the Ravens to be competitive, as well. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>When the <strong>Steelers</strong> finally get their embarrassment of offensive riches on the field together \u2013 Ben Roethlisberger, Le\u2019Veon Bell and Antonio Brown \u2013 they\u2019re clearly the team to beat. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>AFC West champion</strong></h2> <p><strong>Chiefs</strong>. If Kansas City is going to win the AFC West, this is the year. The Broncos should take a step back from 2015 and Derek Carr and the Raiders are still likely a year way from being true contenders. Alex Smith can\u2019t let this opportunity slip through his small hands. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p><strong>Kansas City</strong> are a Super Bowl team. If all the pieces are working together and the Chiefs can do what hasn\u2019t always happened and win the big games, they should roll to at least the AFC title game. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>This feels to me like the toughest division to call. I\u2019m going with the <strong>Chiefs</strong>, whose defense remains strong despite departures in the secondary, and whose deep stable of running backs will keep things ticking along on the other side of the ball. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>Denver\u2019s stout defense covered for Peyton Manning last year and Northwestern alum Trevor Siemian won\u2019t prove the downgrade most people think. Look for the <strong>Broncos</strong> to win a sixth straight division crown. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>AFC South champion</strong></h2> <p>Look for the <strong>Colts</strong> to eke out the AFC South with a record in the neighborhood of 9-7, giving them the opportunity to raise another somewhat humiliating banner to the rafters at Lucas Oil Stadium. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>All <strong>Houston</strong> have needed for many seasons now is the quarterback upon whom they can built, and they gave Brock Osweiler a lot of money to be that player. A dark horse here is Jacksonville who have a gifted young defense and a quarterback around whom they can build. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ll back Andrew Luck to haul the <strong>Colts</strong> to first place \u2013 despite glaring weaknesses elsewhere on the roster.<strong> PB</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Colts</strong> will need many more pieces before they\u2019re true contenders, but a healed Andrew Luck should be enough to lift Indy past Houston for the division crown. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>NFC East champion</strong></h2> <p><strong>Washington and the Giants</strong>. I\u2019m calling for a tie. It seems fitting for a division that might be won at 8-8. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Once Tony Romo got hurt it seemed the biggest impediment to Washington\u2019s winning a second straight division title was removed. This remains a flawed team and there are questions about whether Kirk Cousins is really the quarterback to take <strong>Washington</strong> to the top but very quietly general manager Scott McLaughlin has put together a roster of talented young players. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p><strong>Giants</strong>. Having the best healthy quarterback (settle down, Dak devotees) paired with Odell Beckham Jr is a pretty solid starting point in a weak division. Of course, making sure that Eli Manning stays healthy behind that offensive line may not be entirely straightforward. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p><strong>Philadelphia</strong>. The Eagles ride a surprisingly stout defense and occasionally competent offense helmed by first-year quarterback Carson Wentz to finish 8-8 and win this dumpster fire of division on a tiebreaker with Washington. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>NFC North champion</strong></h2> <p><strong>Green Bay</strong>. This division race was wrapped up the second Teddy Bridgewater\u2019s knee was wrapped in an air cast. Is Week 1 too early for the Packers to start resting players for the playoffs? <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>This should have been Minnesota until Teddy Bridgewater got hurt and now the Vikings probably tumble out of the playoffs and Green Bay will step up to win another division title. As long as Aaron Rodgers is their quarterback the Packers will find ways to win games. There\u2019s an excellent chance <strong>Green Bay</strong> will be playing to go to the Super Bowl in January. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Were it not for the Teddy Bridgewater injury, this might have been up for discussion. As it stands, the <strong>Packers</strong>, with Jordy Nelson back in the line-up, are an easy pick. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>With the game\u2019s best quarterback under center and a strength of schedule that ranks 32nd out of 32 teams, <strong>Green Bay </strong>is the pick. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>NFC West champion</strong></h2> <p><strong>Cardinals</strong>. The Cardinals and Seahawks are two of the top five Super Bowl LI favorites in Vegas. Winning the division will be nice, but ultimately meaningless. Both teams look to peak in the postseason. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>It could well be the year of Russell Wilson which means it will also be the year of the <strong>Seahawks</strong>. The Cardinals have made this a very difficult division now. Seattle and Arizona might be the two best teams in the NFC. In the end, Wilson \u2013 and not the Seahawks defense \u2013 will win the division and maybe the Super Bowl. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>On paper, the Cardinals look strongest, but on the field Carson Palmer lost his mojo at the end of 2015 and showed no signs of recapturing it during preseason. I still expect Arizona to be competitive, but for now I\u2019m giving <strong>Seattle</strong> the edge. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p><strong>Arizona</strong>. The Cardinals, who came within a game of the Super Bowl last year, have experience on both sides of the ball and one of the NFL\u2019s top quarterbacks in Carson Palmer. No team in the league is deeper from top to bottom. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>NFC South champion</strong></h2> <p>The NFC South should be won by <strong>Carolina</strong> with ease. Remember the performance the Panthers put up in the Super Bowl? Even 16 more of those will win them this division. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Carolina without Josh Norman will not be the Carolina of last season. That said, there are no other contenders in the NFC South. The <strong>Panthers</strong> should win the division again with little trouble, especially if Cam Newton has another great season. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Yes, the <strong>Panthers</strong> had a soft schedule last season, and sure, losing Josh Norman hurts. But they did also get back a 1,000-yard receiver in Kelvin Benjamin. They are still the best team in this division. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>No Super Bowl losers\u2019 curse for <strong>Carolina</strong>, who were beaten only once during last year\u2019s regular season and remain the class of the division. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>AFC wild card teams</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"587d8dfe2828849fbee4f4adae1b62ebf2934891\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/587d8dfe2828849fbee4f4adae1b62ebf2934891/0_0_3600_2712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"It couldn\u2019t happen again, could it?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"753\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It couldn\u2019t happen again, could it?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cincinnati Bengals, Denver Broncos <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Baltimore Ravens, Miami Dolphins <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Cincinnati Bengals, Oakland Raiders <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>New England Patriots, Kansas City Chiefs <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>NFC wild card teams</strong></h2> <p>Seattle Seahawks, Minnesota Vikings <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Arizona Cardinals, Chicago Bears <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Arizona Cardinals, Minnesota Vikings <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>Seattle Seahawks, Minnesota Vikings <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>AFC championship game</strong></h2> <p>New England Patriots over Pittsburgh Steelers <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>New England Patriots over Kansas City Chiefs <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Pittsburgh Steelers over New England Patriots <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>Pittsburgh Steelers over Kansas City Chiefs <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>NFC championship game</strong></h2> <p>Carolina Panthers over Seattle Seahawks<strong> DG</strong></p> <p>Seattle Seahawks over Green Bay Packers <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Seattle Seahawks over Green Bay Packers <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>Arizona Cardinals over Green Bay Packers <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Super Bowl LI</strong></h2> <p>Remember all the criticism Cam Newton faced after last year\u2019s Super Bowl?

  "<h2>\u2018Trump is our wakeup call\u2019 </h2> <p><strong>Raul Rodriguez, 74, Apple Valley, California</strong></p> <p>I always carry a bullhorn with me to rallies and campaign events. Into it I shout: \u201cAmerica, wake up!\u201d Americans have been asleep for way too long. We need to realise that the future of our country is at stake.</p> <p>If we don\u2019t elect Donald Trump, we\u2019ll get another four years of Barack Obama and frankly, I don\u2019t know what would happen to this wonderful country of ours. Obama has already done so much to destroy our way of life and Hillary Clinton is promising to carry on where he left off. Like Obama, she wants to change our fundamental values \u2013 the ones people like my father fought to defend.</p> <p>My father was born in Durango, Mexico. When he came to the US he joined the military and served as a medic during the second world war. He was a very proud American \u2013 he truly loved this country. I think I got my sense of patriotism from him.</p> <p>Obama and Hillary Clinton want to have open borders. They let illegal immigrants cross our borders and now they want to accept thousands of Syrians. We don\u2019t know who these people are. If they want to come to this country, they have to do it the right way, like my father did it.</p> <p>I\u2019m tired of politicians telling voters what they want to hear and then returning to Washington and doing whatever their party tells them to do. Politicians are supposed to represent the people \u2013 not their parties or their donors.</p> <p>Part of the reason I like Donald Trump is because he isn\u2019t an established politician. Sometimes that hurts him and people get offended. But the truth hurts. Even if he doesn\u2019t say it well, he\u2019s not wrong. Trump is our wakeup call.</p> <h2>\u2018Democrats treat Latinos as if we\u2019re all one big group\u2019 </h2> <p><strong>Ximena Barreto, 31, San Diego, California</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"1664391d889268076782028fc18866ab4329dab0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1664391d889268076782028fc18866ab4329dab0/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ximena Barreto\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ximena Barreto</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edoardo Delille and Giulia Piermartiri/Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was in primary school in my native Colombia when my father was murdered. I was six \u2013 just one year older than my daughter is now. My father was an officer in the Colombian army at a time when wearing a uniform made you a target for narcoterrorists, Farc fighters and guerrilla groups.</p> <p>What I remember clearly from those early years is the bombing and the terror. I was so afraid, especially after my dad died. At night, I would curl up in my mother\u2019s bed while she held me close. She could not promise me that everything was going to be all right, because it wasn\u2019t true. I don\u2019t want my daughter to grow up like that.</p> <p>But when I turn on my TV, I see terrorist attacks in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-bernardino-shooting\">San Bernardino</a> and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/orlando-terror-attack\">Orlando</a>. There are dangerous people coming across our borders. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> was right. Some are rapists and criminals, but some are good people, too. But how do we know who is who, when you come here illegally?</p> <p>I moved to the US in 2006 on a work permit. It took nearly five years and thousands of dollars to become a US citizen. I know the process is not perfect, but it\u2019s the law. Why would I want illegals coming in when I had to go through this? It\u2019s not fair that they\u2019re allowed to jump the line and take advantage of so many benefits, ones that I pay for with my tax dollars.</p> <p>People assume that because I\u2019m a woman, I should vote for the woman; or that because I\u2019m Latina, I should vote for the Democrat. <a href=\"https://www.democrats.org/\">The Democrats</a> have been pandering to minorities and women for the last 50 years. They treat Latinos as if we\u2019re all one big group. I\u2019m Colombian \u2013 I don\u2019t like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariachi\">Mariachi</a> music. Donald Trump is not just saying what he thinks people want to hear, he\u2019s saying what they\u2019re afraid to say. I believe that he\u2019s the only candidate who can make America strong and safe again.</p> <h2>\u2018Trump beat the system: what\u2019s more American than that?\u2019 <br></h2> <p><strong>Bertran Usher, 20, Inglewood, California</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"c9a789c6ba6d2e81ecc85d4e5b9a044fd800a721\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9a789c6ba6d2e81ecc85d4e5b9a044fd800a721/0_0_6861_4579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bertran Usher\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bertran Usher, centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edoardo Delille and Giulia Piermartiri/Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump is the candidate America deserves. For decades, Americans have bemoaned politicians and Washington insiders. We despise political speak and crave fresh, new ideas. When you ask for someone with no experience, this is what you get. It\u2019s like saying you don\u2019t want a doctor to operate on you.</p> <p>But Trump is a big FU to America. He beat the system and proved everyone wrong. What\u2019s more American than that?</p> <p>As a political science student who one day hopes to go into politics, I am studying this election closely. Both candidates are deeply unpopular and people of my generation are not happy with their choices. I believe we can learn what not to do from this election. I see how divided the country is, and it\u2019s the clearest sign that politicians will have to learn to work together to make a difference. It\u2019s not always easy, but I\u2019ve seen this work.</p> <p>I was raised in a multicultural household. My mother, a Democrat, is Latino and African American, raised in the inner city of Los Angeles. My father, a Republican, is an immigrant from Belize. My parents and I don\u2019t always see eye to eye on everything, but our spirited debates have helped add nuance to my politics.</p> <p>I\u2019m in favour of small government, but I support gay rights. I believe welfare is an important service for Americans who need it, but I think our current programme needs to be scaled back. I think we need to have stricter enforcement of people who come to the country illegally, but I don\u2019t think we should deport the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAM_Act\">DREAMers</a> [children of immigrants who were brought to the country illegally, named after the 2001 Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act].</p> <p>Trump can be a nut, but I think he\u2019s the best candidate in this election. Though there are issues of his I disagree with, at least he says what\u2019s on his mind, as opposed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>, who hides what she\u2019s thinking behind her smile.</p> <p>It\u2019s up to my generation to fix the political mess we\u2019re in. I plan to be a part of the solution.</p> <h2>\u2018Trump\u2019s The Art Of The Deal inspired me to be a businessman\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Omar Navarro, 27, Torrance, California</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"d2c10107b422012528f905574268315705f19a45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2c10107b422012528f905574268315705f19a45/0_0_7207_4810/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Omar Navarro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When I was a kid, people would ask what I wanted to be when I grew up. I would tell them: I want to be president of the United States. If that doesn\u2019t work out, I want to be a billionaire like Trump.</p> <p>In a way, I supported him long before he announced he was running for president. He was my childhood hero. I read <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trump-Art-Deal-Tony-Schwartz/dp/0345479173\">The Art Of The Deal</a> as a student; it inspired me to become a businessman. Now I own a small business and am <a href=\"http://www.omarnavarro.com/\">running for Congress</a> in California\u2019s 43rd district.</p> <p>Trump built an empire and a strong brand that\u2019s recognisable all around the world; he\u2019s a household name and a world-class businessman. Almost anywhere you go, you can see the mark of Donald Trump on a building or property. When I see that, I see the American Dream.</p> <p>Some people ask me how I can support Donald Trump as the son of a Mexican and Cuban immigrants. They are categorising me. In this country we label people: Hispanic, African American, Asian, Caucasian. We separate and divide people into social categories based on race, ethnicity, gender and creed. To me, this is a form of racism. I\u2019m proud of my Hispanic heritage but I\u2019m an American, full stop.</p> <p>Like all immigrants, my parents came to this country for a better opportunity. But they did it legally. They didn\u2019t cut the line. They assimilated to the American way of life, learned English and opened small businesses.</p> <p>Why should we allow people to skirt the law? Imagine making a dinner reservation and arriving at the restaurant to find out that another family has been seated at your table. How is that fair?</p> <p>We have to have laws and as a country we must enforce those laws. A society without laws is just anarchy. If someone invited you to their house and asked you to remove your shoes would you keep them on? If we don\u2019t enforce the rules, why would anyone respect them? I believe Donald Trump will enforce the rules.</p> <h2>\u2018He has taken a strong stand against abortion\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Jimena Rivera, 20, student at the University of Texas at Brownsville</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"866ac5439ecdffc7b9ae72c603c3cfe422767c31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/866ac5439ecdffc7b9ae72c603c3cfe422767c31/0_178_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jimena Rivera\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m Mexican, so I don\u2019t have a vote, but I support Donald Trump because he is the one candidate who opposes abortion. He may have wavered in the beginning, but since becoming the nominee he has taken a strong stand against abortion.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton is running as the leader of a party that has pushed a very pro-choice platform. Even Democrats like her running mate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/tim-kaine-vice-president-hillary-clinton-2016-campaign\">Tim Kaine</a>, who is a devout Catholic, compromise their faith to support abortion.</p> <p>I don\u2019t always agree with his positions on immigration. I see the border wall every day. I\u2019m not convinced that it\u2019s effective. The people who want to cross will find a way. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that they do, but most of them are looking for a better way of life. A wall won\u2019t stop them.</p> <h2>\u2018Lower taxes and less regulation will create more jobs\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Marissa Desilets, 22, Palm Springs, California</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"450c2f014822304e0e943cdc41fd5278e5d94229\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/450c2f014822304e0e943cdc41fd5278e5d94229/0_0_7236_4829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marissa Desilets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I am a proud Hispanic conservative Republican woman. I became politically engaged as a political science and economics major at university. By my junior year, I was a member of the campus Republicans\u2019 club. As a student of economics, I am very impressed with Trump\u2019s economic agenda. I believe we must cut taxes for everyone and eliminate the death tax. Lowering taxes and reeling back regulations will create more jobs \u2013 meaning more tax-paying Americans. This in turn will generate more revenue for the Treasury.</p> <p>I also support Trump because he favours strong leadership and promised to preserve the constitution of the United States. We must have a rule of law in this country. We must close our open borders. Like Trump says: \u201ca nation without borders is not a nation.\u201d This doesn\u2019t mean we should not allow any immigrants. We should welcome new immigrants who choose to legally enter our beautiful country.</p> <p>This won\u2019t be the case if Hillary Clinton becomes president. I would expect the poor to become poorer and our country to become divided. I believe that liberals\u2019 reckless domestic spending will bankrupt our future generations. I refuse to support a party that desires to expand the government and take away my civil liberties.</p> <h2>\u2018He has gone through so many divorces, yet raised such a close-knit family\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Dr Alexander Villicana, 80, Pasadena, California</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"a199d0bc6e8382d4633334ad670f81924eb8a0df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a199d0bc6e8382d4633334ad670f81924eb8a0df/0_0_6867_4583/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Alexander Villicana\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I am an example of the opportunities this country has to offer. My parents came from Mexico at the turn of the 20th century. They were not educated but they worked hard to make a better life for us and it paid off.</p> <p>I went to school and studied cosmetic surgery. Now I work as a plastic surgeon and have been in practice for the last 40 years. I have a beautiful family and my health. I am Hispanic \u2013 but I am a citizen of the United States and I feel very patriotic for this country that has given me so much.</p> <p>I\u2019m supporting Trump because I agree with his vision for our economy. He has experience at the negotiating table, so he knows what to do to create jobs and increase workers\u2019 salaries. In Trump\u2019s America people would be rewarded for their hard work rather than penalised with hefty taxes.</p> <p>The security of our nation is a top priority for me. I think it would be impossible to deport 11 million people who are here illegally, but we have to do a better job of understanding who is in our country and who is trying to come into our country.</p> <p>A lot of what Trump says, especially about security and immigration, is twisted by the media. What he said about Mexicans, for example, that wasn\u2019t negative \u2013 it was the truth. There are Mexicans bringing over drugs and perpetrating rapes. But what he also said \u2013 and the media completely ignored \u2013 is that many Mexicans are good people coming over for a better quality of life.</p> <p>He may be blunt and occasionally offensive but I find him likable. I was so impressed by Trump and his family at the <a href=\"http://convention.gop/\">Republican National Convention</a>. It\u2019s hard for me to imagine that someone who has gone through so many divorces has managed to raise such a close-knit family. None of his children had to work and yet they spoke with eloquence and integrity about their father.</p> <h2>\u2018When Trump is harsh about Mexicans, he is right\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Francisco Rivera, 43, Huntington Park, California</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"3639ceafcf54195ed84c6a79ce56a6a7466e6694\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3639ceafcf54195ed84c6a79ce56a6a7466e6694/0_0_6675_4455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Francisco Rivera\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>People ask me how I can support Donald Trump. I say, let me tell you a story. I was in line at the movie theatre recently when I saw a young woman toss her cupcake into a nearby planter as if it were a trash can. I walked over to her and said, \u201cHoney, excuse me, does that look like a garbage can to you?\u201d And you know what she told me? \u201cThere\u2019s already trash in the planter, so what does it matter?\u201d</p> <p>I asked her what part of Mexico she was from. She seemed surprised and asked how I knew she was from Mexico. \u201cLook at what you just did,\u201d I told her. \u201cDonald Trump may sound harsh when he speaks about Mexicans, but he is right. It\u2019s people like you that make everyone look bad.\u201d</p> <p>I moved from Mexico with my family when I was seven. I still carry a photo of my brother and I near our home, to remind people how beautiful the city once was. Now I spend my time erasing graffiti from the walls and picking up trash. Sixty years ago, we accepted immigrants into our country who valued the laws, rules and regulations that made America the land of opportunity. Back in those days, people worked hard to improve themselves and their communities.</p> <p>I\u2019m tired of living in a lawless country. It\u2019s like we put a security guard at the front door, but the Obama administration unlocked the back door. And I have seen what my own people have done to this country. They want to convert America into the country they left behind. This country has given me so many opportunities I wouldn\u2019t have had if my mom had raised her family in Mexico. I want America to be great again, and that\u2019s why in November I am going to vote for Donald Trump.</p> <h2>\u2018I voted for Obama twice, but Hillary gets a free pass\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Teresa Mendoza, 44, Mesa, Arizona</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"18bd81334319772adbf229a3b1f8926ccb313c41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18bd81334319772adbf229a3b1f8926ccb313c41/0_495_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teresa Mendoza\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In my day job I am a real estate agent but every now and then I dabble in standup comedy.

You can\u2019t say \u201cHand me the black crayon\u201d without someone snapping back at you: \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Donald Trump offended a lot of people when he gave the speech calling [Mexicans] rapists and criminals but he didn\u2019t offend me.</p> <p>I was a liberal Democrat all my life. Before this I voted for Obama twice. I wanted to be a part of history. If it wasn\u2019t for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act\">Obamacare</a> and the ridiculous growth of our federal government, I\u2019d probably still be a Democrat, asleep at the wheel. But I woke up and realised I\u2019m actually much more in line with Republicans on major policy points.</p> <p>I like to joke that I\u2019m an original anchor baby. My parents came from Mexico in the 1970s under the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracero_program\">Bracero work programme</a> making me a California-born Chicana. We later became US citizens. But now that I\u2019m a Republican, Hillary Clinton is trying to tell me I\u2019m \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right\">alt-right</a>\u201d. It\u2019s strange isn\u2019t it? All of a sudden I\u2019m a white nationalist.</p> <p>My sons and I go back and forth. They don\u2019t like Trump. But it\u2019s what they\u2019re hearing in school, from their friends and teachers, who are all getting their news from the same biased news outlets.</p> <p>I\u2019m very concerned about the role the media is taking in this election. The networks sensationalise and vilify Trump while they give Hillary Clinton a free pass. It amazes me. I don\u2019t care if Trump likes to eat his fried chicken with a fork and a knife. I do care that Clinton has not been held responsible for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Benghazi_attack\">Benghazi attacks</a>.</p>",

Well, the Giants attacked the Swans hard and had obvious success in roughing up their more fancied opponents. Shane Mumford and Steve Johnson were among the enforcers and the latter is likely to face intense scrutiny from the match review panel for a shirt-front that flattened Swans on-baller Josh Kennedy. Mumford slung Kurt Tippett to the ground in a rough tackle that might also have him in the sights of the MRP.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t just brute strength. GWS took their chances and enjoyed sustained passages of dominance. Jeremy Cameron tore the game open in the third term with three goals and a number of other inspirational plays. He finished with 4.4 from 13 disposals and six marks, while rather tellingly, Lance Franklin managed only 0.2 at the other end, having gathered many of his 20 possessions further up the ground. Toby Greene was immense up forward for the Giants, while Lachie Whitfield, Stephen Coniglio and Devon Smith all dominated in the middle of the ground.</p> <p>That\u2019s all from me but thanks for joining us for what\u2019s been a fascinating qualifying final, one that emphatically confirmed that the Giants mean business.

Another thing the Giants have done well is ensure that bar the set shot he missed a few minutes back, Franklin is only getting easy ball well up the ground and too high to be a scoring threat himself.

There are a number of proposals out there. One is to capture the CO<sub>2</sub> that pours out of our power stations, liquefy it, and store it in chambers deep under the ground. Another is to seed the oceans with iron to trigger huge algae blooms that will absorb CO<sub>2</sub>. Others take a different approach, such as putting giant mirrors in space to deflect some of the sun\u2019s rays, or pumping aerosols into the stratosphere to create man-made clouds. Unfortunately, in all of these cases either the risks are too dangerous, or we don\u2019t have the technology yet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db208f9e1262918dee1336f55e64cd47930c6afb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db208f9e1262918dee1336f55e64cd47930c6afb/0_0_3000_1986/1000.jpg\" alt=\"These pipes at Vattenfall\u2019s \u201cSchwarze Pumpe\u201d (\u201cBlack Pump\u201d) power station were part of a pilot CCS project in 2009.

But while engineers are scrambling to come up with grand geo-engineering schemes, they may be overlooking a simpler, less glamorous solution. It has to do with soil.</p> <p>Soil is the second biggest reservoir of carbon on the planet, next to the oceans. It holds four times more carbon than all the plants and trees in the world. But human activity like deforestation and industrial farming \u2013 with its intensive ploughing, monoculture and heavy use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides \u2013 is ruining our soils at breakneck speed, killing the organic materials that they contain. Now 40% of agricultural soil is <a href=\"http://world.time.com/2012/12/14/what-if-the-worlds-soil-runs-out/\">classed as</a> \u201cdegraded\u201d or \u201cseriously degraded\u201d. In fact, industrial farming has so damaged our soils that a third of the world\u2019s farmland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/02/arable-land-soil-food-security-shortage\">has been destroyed</a> in the past four decades.</p> <p>As our soils degrade, they are losing their ability to hold carbon, releasing enormous <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjr2LT2_97OAhWHnBoKHVL9AWEQFggcMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ipcc.ch%2Fpdf%2Fassessment-report%2Far5%2Fwg3%2Fipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter11.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNEr-vDSWnifEBEQGS61WMIvfaLN3w&amp;sig2=3A38wbSJ5kZ1eAqCEqOzBA&amp;bvm=bv.131286987,d.d2s\">plumes of CO<sub>2</sub></a> [pdf] into the atmosphere.</p> <p>There is, however, a solution. Scientists and farmers around the world are pointing out that we can regenerate degraded soils by switching from intensive industrial farming to more ecological methods \u2013 not just organic fertiliser, but also no-tillage, composting, and crop rotation. Here\u2019s the brilliant part: as the soils recover, they not only regain their capacity to hold CO<sub>2</sub>, they begin to actively pull additional CO<sub>2</sub> out of the atmosphere.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The battle here is not just between two different methods. It is between two different ways of relating to the land</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The science on this is quite exciting. A study published recently by the US National Academy of Sciences claims that regenerative farming can <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/44/18226.full\">sequester 3%</a> of our global carbon emissions. An article in <em>Science </em>suggests it could be <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/304/5677/1623\">up to 15%</a>. And new research from the Rodale Institute in Pennsylvania, although not yet peer-reviewed, says sequestration rates could be <a href=\"http://rodaleinstitute.org/regenerative-organic-agriculture-and-climate-change/\">as high as 40%</a>. The same report argues that if we apply regenerative techniques to the world\u2019s pastureland as well, we could capture more than 100% of global emissions. In other words, regenerative farming may be our best shot at actually cooling the planet.</p> <p>Yet despite having the evidence on their side, proponents of regenerative farming \u2013 like the international farmers\u2019 association <a href=\"https://viacampesina.org/en/index.php/actions-and-events-mainmenu-26/-climate-change-and-agrofuels-mainmenu-75/1887-together-we-can-cool-the-planet-full-video\">La Via Campesina</a> \u2013 are fighting an uphill battle. The multinational corporations that run the industrial food system seem to be dead set against it because it threatens their monopoly power \u2013 power that relies on seeds linked to patented chemical fertilisers and pesticides. They are well aware that their methods are causing climate change, but they insist that it\u2019s a necessary evil: if we want to feed the world\u2019s growing population, we don\u2019t have a choice \u2013 it\u2019s the only way to secure high yields.</p> <p>Scientists are calling their bluff. First of all, feeding the world isn\u2019t about higher yields; it\u2019s about fairer distribution. We already grow enough food <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Holt-Gimenez/publication/241746569_We_Already_Grow_Enough_Food_for_10_Billion_People_and_Still_Can%27t_End_Hunger/links/554b83710cf29752ee7c8d22.pdf?origin=publication_detail\">for 10 billion people</a>. In any case, it can be argued that regenerative farming actually <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/304/5677/1623.full\">increases crop yields</a> over the long term by enhancing soil fertility and improving resilience against drought and flooding. So as climate change makes farming more difficult, this may be our best bet for food security, too.</p> <p>The battle here is not just between two different methods. It is between two different ways of relating to the land: one that sees the soil as an object from which profit must be extracted at all costs, and one that recognizes the interdependence of living systems and honours the principles of balance and harmony.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a98cacddbf9fe4507c3fbe50e25306656bbde0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a98cacddbf9fe4507c3fbe50e25306656bbde0e/0_3_2436_1463/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lines of maize on the Malaysian organic farm run by Dr Mohd Ishak Syed Ahmad in Malacca.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lines of maize on the Malaysian organic farm run by Dr Mohd Ishak Syed Ahmad in Malacca.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bazuki Muhammad/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ultimately, this is about more than just soil. It is about something much larger. As Pope Francis put it in his much-celebrated encyclical last year, our present ecological crisis is the sign of a cultural pathology. \u201cWe have come to see ourselves as the lords and masters of the Earth, entitled to plunder her at will. The sickness evident in the soil, in the water, in the air and in all forms of life are symptoms that reflect the violence present in our hearts. We have forgotten that we ourselves are dust of the Earth; that we breathe her air and receive life from her waters.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe our engineers are missing the point. The problem with geo-engineering is that it proceeds from the very same logic that got us into this mess in the first place: one that treats the land as something to be subdued, dominated and consumed. But the solution to climate change won\u2019t be found in the latest schemes to bend our living planet to the will of man. Perhaps instead it lies in something much more down to earth \u2013 an ethic of care and healing, starting with the soils on which our existence depends. </p> <p>Of course, regenerative farming <a href=\"https://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/notill.htm\">doesn\u2019t offer</a> a permanent solution to the climate crisis; soils can only hold a finite amount of carbon. We still need to get off fossil fuels, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 we have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/15/clean-energy-wont-save-us-economic-system-can\">kick our obsession</a> with endless exponential growth and downsize our material economy to bring it back in tune with ecological cycles.

Skepta started releasing music in the early 00s, a key figure in the grime scene that emerged when London\u2019s sink estates started producing a dark, low-res reflection of the shiny UK garage that was dominating pop. After starting Meridian Crew (named after his Tottenham estate), then the Boy Better Know crew with his brother and fellow MC, Jamie \u201cJME\u201d Adenuga, Skepta became a cult underground artist. He was feted for his merciless, witty abuse of other MCs and carrying an unshakable self-determination that owed nothing to traditional musical channels in order to get his music heard.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Radio 1 doesn\u2019t exist to me.

I don\u2019t judge my success by anything they say.\u201d</p> <p>This scorn for the mainstream was exacerbated by his bruising mid-career flirtations with chart pop. Like many grime artists in the 2010s, when the industry was giddy with the bouncy chart hits of Dizzee Rascal, Tinchy Stryder and Tinie Tempah, Skepta was signed to Universal. He put out a string of singles that, while moderately successful, crowbarred him on to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVSr0tLQr_4\">vapid pop-dance beats</a>. US artists such as Puff Daddy were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOYUOgmTjU4\">brought in for guest spots</a> in an attempt to make Skepta sound like every identikit chart rapper. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e137a8ba901a32e6951d5196aa4e8f6e614d32ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e137a8ba901a32e6951d5196aa4e8f6e614d32ef/0_460_6741_4045/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Skepta and members of his BBK crew in Hackney, east London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boy knows better...

He shakes his head at the memory: \u201cIn every area of life you get a natural talent and then somebody comes in, a manager who knows about the business, they take them and fuck them over. The talent realises they\u2019ve been fucked over and come out the other side. Some of them fall off and some people come out untouchable. And I\u2019m one of the people that came out untouchable.

Free from label constraints, he replaced euphoric pop riffs with his own defiant productions: ice-cold electronic rhythms spiked with reggae bass and techno futurism, resurrecting the grime sound that made his name and releasing them on his own BBK label. It was the right move. In 2014, he let loose That\u2019s Not Me, a shot of brutal energy that atoned for every misstep he\u2019d made in the last four years in three thrilling minutes. Its video was filmed on an \u00a380 budget and <a href=\"http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/13946393.Tottenham_rapper_Skepta_wins_big_at_the_MOBOs/\">won a Mobo award</a>. His absolution was complete. Following single Shutdown nailed his anti-mainstream stance in two blunt lines: \u201cThey try to steal my vision/ This ain\u2019t a culture, it\u2019s my religion.\u201d</p> <p>From there, grime went national, aided by direct-to-fan social media. In tandem with the genre\u2019s popularity and a wealth of new MCs breaking through, Skepta\u2019s notoriety expanded outside his core London fanbase to a new audience of suburban teenagers. His internet-enabled model, where releases would be pushed through his own channels, removed the distorting effect of major-label A&amp;R opinion; grime could flourish as it pleased with no commercial interference. By summer 2015, the Boy Better Know crew were drawing as big a crowd at the Reading and Leeds festivals as they were at Wiley\u2019s underground rave Eskimo Dance. Then it went global. By the time Skepta dropped Konnichiwa earlier this year, he was playing gigs from Tokyo to Lagos.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyONbqggasY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dyONbqggasY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Basking in the heat, Skepta contemplates the album that\u2019s gunning for a Mercury win. \u201cAs a younger man, I didn\u2019t think this was possible,\u201d he says. Its instant popularity still tickles him (all the more so as Konnichiwa was distributed direct from his home, his living room doubling up as a make-do CD warehouse). \u201cLike, my album came out in May, I was on a flight to Toronto the next day to play a show, and they knew all the words to the new songs. The next day! You think when I was a kid I ever thought that would happen? I mean, Pharrell Williams is on my album! If I was on a major label I might think, \u2018Oh yeah, that\u2019s what happens isn\u2019t it, I\u2019m signed, I\u2019ve got loads of money.\u2019 You don\u2019t even appreciate it. \u2019Cause I\u2019m independent, I wake up every day, look in the mirror, and I\u2019m like: \u2018You! You scruffy little shit from Tottenham got Pharrell on your album! I\u2019m blessed, bro.\u2019 That independent existence is scary because I don\u2019t have no certainty in my life. But that adrenaline is sick, it makes me make things happen.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If wearing a hoodie means you\u2019re going to rob something, I\u2019m going to wear a hoodie and go to No 1</p> <footer> <cite>Skepta</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The appearance of super-producer Pharrell was one of Skepta\u2019s few concessions to the accepted wisdom of packing an album with guest spots; in contrast, the producers alone listed on the latest Kanye and Beyonc\u00e9 records add up to a phone book\u2019s worth of names. But Skepta, who produces the majority of his own music, was determined to keep Konnichiwa tight. Talk of the potential of big-name US collaborations darkens his mood.</p> <p>\u201cI had so many anti-climaxes in America,\u201d he says. Since his star has risen in the States, numerous artists have been clamouring for a slice of Brit authenticity. But Skepta is unimpressed by their fame game. \u201cArtists that I look up to, that I\u2019d seen on television here in London, I meet them and they\u2019re not even human,\u201d he continues. \u201cThey\u2019re just arseholes \u2013 people that, when I was younger, I thought were gonna inspire me when I met them. For real, they\u2019ve gone too far. People tell them that they\u2019re an artist and that they\u2019re big and that\u2019s what they become.

He discarded the designer clothing he wore in the major-label years, reverting to basic black tracksuits that realigned him with the kids on the streets. (\u201cIf they paint us with the brush that means wearing a hoodie means you\u2019re going to rob something, I\u2019m going to put on a hoodie and go to fucking No 1,\u201d he says). His album is full of tracks where he is the relatable everyman, from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVw542-t5W4\">Crime Riddim</a>\u2019s tales of police harassment to the titular opener pointing out that he travelled \u201cto the Brits on a train\u2026 Man shut down Wireless, then I walked home in the rain\u201d.

True to his word, Skepta is friendly, giving them advice, genuinely listening to their responses, then resolutely refusing a selfie. They leave, starstruck and satisfied. Talk of grime spreading has the MC philosophical. \u201cWe\u2019ve been ahead for so long in the UK, we\u2019re so multicultural and that\u2019s the beauty,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why grime was formed, from this mix, this understanding of different people. Now other people are catching on. There\u2019s a revolution happening.\u201d</p> <p>When Skepta talks of a revolution, he\u2019s talking about one that starts from within. He\u2019s a firm believer in self-actualisation, as well as the power of creating networks outside of the conventional structures. \u201cGetting in touch with your life purpose is important,\u201d he says, if by now a little hazily. \u201cNow I understand what I\u2019m here to tell everyone: togetherness is everything, bruv.\u201d</p> <p>As such, it\u2019s little surprise that he\u2019s got no time for party politics. Whereas some grime artists like Novelist are taking to the stage, encouraging chants of \u201cFuck David Cameron\u201d and tweeting their allegiance to the Labour Party, all that is bottom of Skepta\u2019s agenda. Last month, Tory culture secretary <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edvaizey/status/761257407179882496\">Ed Vaizey sent Skepta and fellow rapper Kano a congratulatory tweet</a> for being nominated for a Mercury award. He had ignored all the non-grime artists on the shortlist in what looked like a bizarre, craven reach for credibility. Vaizey wasn\u2019t dismissed in response; he was utterly ignored. Today Skepta has never heard of him, and has no interest in hearing about him whatsoever \u2013 Vaizey is part of a different world to his, and he sees the media and politicians as one and the same.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c5ab0dc48416113f989dd5d947302262df67f25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c5ab0dc48416113f989dd5d947302262df67f25/0_475_5019_5015/1000.jpg\" alt=\"skepta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Skepta: \u2018Greatness is a state of mind\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivia Rose for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He pauses to relight his spliff, and warms to his theme. \u201cThe other day Beyonc\u00e9 was <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4ji6ct\">dancing to That\u2019s Not Me in Wembley arena</a>,\u201d he says. \u201c<em>That</em> should be on the news; that is fucking sick, it\u2019s a game changer.

I don\u2019t know them.\u201d</p> <p>He delivers this last sentence with the conviction of a charismatic leader. And why not? After breaking into the US Billboard charts, and touring the world with an album of slang-heavy music that should only make sense in the UK, you do get the feeling that Skepta could do anything with that sort of self-belief. He seems to know that, too. He taps on the side of his cap, where the word \u201cGREATNESS\u201d is embroidered in bold lettering.</p> <p>\u201cGreatness,\u201d he says. \u201cGreatness is a state of mind.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong><a href=\"http://www.alexandrapalace.com/whats-on/skepta/\">Skepta plays Alexandra Palace, 2 Dec</a>; the Mercury prize is on BBC4 and 6Music on Thursday 15 September</strong></em></p>",

For Brexit supporters it could well be the place to celebrate a historic moment. Remainers, like Daniel, may feel \u201cqueasy\u201d. And then there are the musicians and singers on stage, many of whom are from EU countries, fearful of a future that might have a profound effect on their living if freedom of movement is curtailed.</p> <p>Daniel, artistic director of next week\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.leicesterinternationalmusicfestival.org.uk/\">Leicester international music festival</a>, is British, teaches at a German university and is a married to a Pole.<br></p> <p>He remembers being with his husband when it became clear that Britain had voted to leave. \u201cIt was the most depressing day that we\u2019ve had in our life together, total disbelief,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re a fortress and we\u2019re pulling up the drawbridge. It has put a whole new slant on [the fact that] the first thing British people do when they meet is apologise. Now I have a very good reason to.\u201d</p> <p>This year\u2019s conductor is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/10/conductor-sakari-oramo-first-night-proms\">Sakari Oramo,</a> a Finn who remembers listening to the Last Night on the radio when he was growing up. \u201cI found it very noisy. It was hard to hear the music behind the noise,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Oramo, taking a break from rehearsals, told the Guardian he hoped the evening would be enjoyed for what it was: \u201cA celebration of the eight weeks of glorious music that has happened at the Proms.\u201d</p> <p>He said the programme, which had not been changed as a result of the Brexit vote, had a very international mix with music by Borodin, Rossini, Donizetti and Offenbach. The star soloist will be the Peruvian tenor Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez.</p> <p>But he acknowledges the Last Night also has its celebration of British music. \u201cIt is not like a normal concert,\u201d he said. \u201cNormally when I\u2019m asked I say: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just like a normal concert,\u2019 but this one actually isn\u2019t. This one is special with all the traditions that go with it and of course the noise, especially in the second half, and I think there might be more noise this year \u2026 who knows.\u201d</p> <p>Oramo is not expecting to do anything different, although he said he would not be sporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/14/the-last-night-of-the-proms-review-oramo-williams-jansen-henshall\">the union jack waistcoat he wore in 2014, his first Last Night</a>. \u201cI\u2019ll wear something very stylish I\u2019m sure, but probably nothing so obvious this year.\u201d</p> <p>If there is more enthusiastic flag-waving, that\u2019s fine, Oramo said. \u201cIf it\u2019s so, then let it be. I have to do it because I\u2019m contracted. Whatever I do, and I\u2019m sure the orchestra feel the same way, we will do to the very best of our abilities. We serve the music.\u201d</p> <p>Oramo agreed there were fears among musicians about the future, but the concert hall was not the place to air them. \u201cPeople are feeling very uneasy about the situation, that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019ve talked to musicians about the general situation but it has not affected us in that way. Everyone is there who was supposed to be there originally.\u201d</p> <p>Musicians are right to be worried, according to <a href=\"http://www.jamesinvernemusic.com/\">the consultant and cultural commentator James Inverne</a>, who fears the British orchestral scene will be \u201cwrecked\u201d unless the right decisions are made after the Brexit vote. Arguably more than any other sector, classical musicians and singers rely on being able to work easily across Europe.</p> <p>\u201cI can tell you, having British artists work in the US is an enormous pain in the neck,\u201d said Inverne. \u201cIt is an important market, they want to go there, but the sheer amount of work that goes into setting up a visa, and the expense, often deters American orchestras from employing overseas artists.\u201d</p> <p>He worries what impression the Last Night \u2013 \u201ca wonderful thing, great fun\u201d \u2013 might send out and that it could \u201cironically underscore the worries about the disharmony that Brexit might bring\u201d.<br></p> <p>Inverne added: \u201cIn the last 10 years or so it has managed to avoid being seen as parochial because Britain has been so connected to the world. London has been an international hub.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a sense of it being a party for the world which happens in London and the audience has been international, helped by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/847Crs5TrVJpsgF0xjDzmT/proms-in-the-park-2016-london-general-information-faqs\">Proms in the Parks</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPost-Brexit and in the immediate few years when it is sensitive, I think they will want to be careful that this is not seen as a jingoistic celebration of the rejection of Europe, or any kind of preening, and that can be difficult because of the second half.\u201d</p> <p>It is, of course, not the first time the Last Night has been held at a sensitive time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/01/mark-elder-conductor-portrait-artist\">Mark Elder</a> was famously replaced as conductor in 1990 after saying he did not wish to conduct Land of Hope and Glory and Rule Britannia! during the time of the Gulf war. </p> <p>Programmes have been changed at the last minute because of events. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LoUm_r7It8\">John Adams\u2019s Short Ride in a Fast Machine</a> has the distinction of being dropped twice, in 1997 after the death of Diana and 2011 after the September 11 terrorist attacks. </p> <p>Concertgoers were also handed copies of the American national anthem to sing that year, recalled Peter Avis, a Proms regular for more than 50 years. \u201cIt was certainly different and was not so jolly and jumpy up and down as it would have been.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, the Last Night is patriotic, he said, but it also had a history of protest with people regularly taking in banners, whether that was in support of gay rights or the miners. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/13/refugees-welcome-banner-steals-show-last-night-proms-royal-albert-hall\">A \u201crefugees welcome\u201d banner was something of a show-stealer last year</a>. </p> <p>There is a chance that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/07/pro-eu-protest-planned-for-last-night-of-the-proms\">many EU flags will be waved this year, with one crowdfunded campaign successfully raising \u00a31,175</a> for them. About two dozen volunteers will be outside the Royal Albert Hall hoping to persuade concertgoers to fly the flag instead of, or alongside, the union jack.</p> <p>Avis, whose MA was about the Proms, said the Last Night seemed more nationalistic than in previous decades because of people in the boxes who saw it as an \u201cevent\u201d where union flag waving was almost compulsory.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the only thing a lot of people think the Proms does,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of us don\u2019t think of it being particularly patriotic and some balk at singing Rule Britannia!\u201d<br></p> <p>Avis, whose first Prom was the Last Night in 1961, has this year cut himself down to 20 concerts and will not be there on Saturday, although not because of Brexit. \u201cWe have got rather fed up with it. It\u2019s so long and there is all this business of waving at everybody on the screens.\u201d</p> <p>BBC Proms lovers, like Daniel, stress that they have got nothing against the Last Night and there are no obvious calls for any changes because of Brexit. \u201cThe Last Night is a celebration of the Proms and a celebration of music-making and an opportunity to have a good singsong,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not knock that. And it is also, in this day and age, just great to see music on the telly, frankly.\u201d</p> <p>Many people will hope the whole evening is free of politics, and they can just enjoy the music and the daftness.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/07/last-night-of-the-proms-nicholas-kenyon-brexit\">former Proms director Sir Nicholas Kenyon, writing this week in the Guardian</a>, acknowledged there might be a sense of foreboding this year but said the music being played had its roots outside Britain. \u201cThe inspiration our native music has derived from continental Europe and beyond has been deep and lasting,\u201d he said.</p> <p>How heavily Brexit looms on Saturday night remains to be seen.

Scraps of the moon on the surface like a shoal of fish floating belly up. The slow rock and tip and the slap of the water on the side of the boat.\u201d</p> <p>Billed as the first instalment in a series of \u201cfolk crime\u201d novels, <em>Turning Blue</em> delivers a vision of rural noir so depraved and decadent it makes the reader want never to leave the city. It is&#xa0;set in the wild landscapes of North Yorkshire. If the National Parks organisation had read <em>Turning Blue</em>, they\u2019d have taken to their heels and fled rather than awarding the Yorkshire Dales National Park its recent expansion.</p> <p>Christmas and a blizzard are about to engulf a nameless hamlet in the Dales when a local teenage girl goes missing. As is often the case in noir fiction, the reader knows her fate but neither her family nor the police will discover what happened to Melanie Muncy or the tangled reasons why for&#xa0;another 300 pages.</p> <p>The police officer charged with investigating the case and the dark secrets of the hamlet and its close-knit residentsis DS James Brindle from the Cold Storage unit. He has the qualifications for a fictional cop \u2013 he is cut off from his colleagues on a superficial level by a disfiguring facial birthmark and on a deeper level by an obsessive compulsive disorder that makes his life too complicated for human connections. And he is, of course, doggedly persistent and more brilliant than any other detective.</p> <p>His unlikely sidekick emerges in the shape of local journalist Roddy Mace, a&#xa0;refugee from the London tabloids who has fled his life of sex and drugs and alcohol in a bid to find his true calling as a writer of fiction. Friendship is too rocky a road for either of them to believe in, but somehow they forge a connection neither can acknowledge, either to themselves or to each other.</p> <p>And then there is the beast at the heart of the labyrinth, Steve Rutter the pigman. As the grim narrative unfolds, it\u2019s hard to be certain whether that\u2019s a&#xa0;job description or a definition. The depiction of Rutter\u2019s terrible history and ultimate disintegration is almost too disgusting to bear, pushing us beyond the possibility of sympathy or&#xa0;pity to a state of bewildered anger.</p> <p>Writhing under the missing girl\u2019s story is a Grand Guignol tale of sexual abuse and extreme pornography that scoops up a cornucopia of recent headlines and supercooks them into a heady mixture of Operation Yewtree (there\u2019s a&#xa0;mashup of Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall), corruption infesting the body politic like a maggot mass, far-reaching cover-ups and international organised crime.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is no hiding from the darkness because the writing is so damned good</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But there is a counterpoint to all this grim horror. Myers summons up the Yorkshire landscape with lyrical aplomb. The bleakness of the snowbound landscape, the beauty of the moors, the vivid realisation of market town and northern city are all rendered with absolute clarity. His prose is beautifully controlled and so graphic it\u2019s impossible not to picture the scenes he conjures up in striking detail. There is no hiding place from the darkness because the writing is so damned good.</p> <p>But the quality of the language provides a seduction that almost masks the problem that lurks within <em>Turning Blue</em>. By escalating the vileness to a point beyond the brutal edge of horror, it loses its power. There came a point where the suspension of disbelief failed me and once that happened, the&#xa0;novel lost its power.</p> <p><em>Turning Blue</em> leaves a dark burn mark in the imagination.

But here\u2019s my advice on how to proceed: treat these seedlings like job applicants. You don\u2019t know who they are yet. They may seem feisty, clever or captivatingly beautiful, but are they going to offer anything original? Most important, are they likely to be inspirational companions, who will lead you to create the best work that you\u2019re capable of? WB&#xa0;Yeats\u2019s advice to writers, \u201cDo not hurry, do not rest\u201d, is&#xa0;relevant here.</p> <p>As the autumn advances, keep a vigil on the applicants. Then, you\u2019ll gradually begin to know what they\u2019re leading you towards. Are you embarking on the long road to something truthful, or just moving towards a heaving skip of recycled bullshit? The landmass of the western world is slowly being submerged by bad books. You don\u2019t want to add to this tonnage, so go slowly into your analysis of what it is you\u2019ve got to say. Does it have real emotional and intellectual grip? If so, then start gathering all the knowledge you\u2019ll need to set forth on your great writing adventure.</p> <p>Only remember that the September applicants may not fulfil their promising CVs. The \u201cbig novel\u201d that shrinks into a&#xa0;Christmas card list is, in the writer\u2019s world, a familiar disaster of the festive season.</p> <p>\u2022 Rose Tremain taught creative writing at the University of East Anglia and is its former chancellor</p> <h2>Pay attention<strong> \u2013</strong> Philip Hensher</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"90664124edde6a43788027aaea9ae8f9c33aaf8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90664124edde6a43788027aaea9ae8f9c33aaf8d/754_0_2995_3744/800.jpg\" alt=\"Eamonn McCabe for the Guardian\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eamonn McCabe for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Think about how people reveal themselves through behaviour, and focus on the externals of gesture, expression, dialogue and settings. It\u2019s tempting, given the limitless power of the omniscient novelist, to plunge into a character\u2019s head and write, baldly, \u201cLaura felt painfully envious\u201d. But what has&#xa0;more energy is the analysis of how a character in the grip&#xa0;of painful envy carries herself, speaks, looks, and even dresses. We always know, if we are observant, how a person who is desperately, secretly in love with another behaves. The trick of fiction is to extract the ways in which other emotions affect the outer crust, too, and by observing the&#xa0;characteristic walk of a human being overcome with happiness, say, making the reader feel observant, and not just laboriously informed.</p> <p>How this carriage affects the characters around her, too: because fiction does not amount to much if it is just one character standing in a stairwell, pondering gravely about past events. If the first lesson of fiction is about the leakage of the abstract into the world of the physical, the second ought to be that fiction is about the way one character\u2019s desires will crash into another\u2019s, and a third, and a fourth, when all that seems to be happening is four friends meeting in a pub, or working together in an office, or finding themselves thrown together by chance. The episode that consists of one person alone leads to nothing much: the episode of four different characters with their own ways of life moves in multiple directions.</p> <p>To do this, the beginning writer is going to have to undertake some systematic observation, notebook in hand. No novelist worth reading ever sat at home, entranced with the words spooling out. They paid attention to the life of the streets, to the mannerisms of their friends, to the way a small child speaks when he is hoping not to get found out.

Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the answer is: \u201cI haven\u2019t quite figured that out yet.\u201d</p> <p>Therefore my default response to all \u201cgreat\u201d ideas in the writing business is to do with the ending. A good ending can redeem a mediocre idea. A bad ending can sink a really good idea. As soon as you know how your narrative ends \u2013 in&#xa0;whatever medium \u2013 then a huge percentage of the problematic issues that arise in the writing will be solved.</p> <p>If you have a clear sense of how your story will end then you can, as it were, rewind to the beginning and plot any number of various routes that will allow you to arrive at that desired ending \u2013 with its attendant catharsis, of course. If you start writing (however striking your original idea) with no sense of how your story will end, then life becomes progressively harder. Flailing around. Writer\u2019s block. Draft after draft. This is how novels get abandoned; film scripts bottom-drawered. The thing to do is to stop and envisage your final pages, your final scene. Take your time. What note do you want to strike? What surprise do you want to spring? What denouement will justify this journey?</p> <p>It may sound mechanical, but story-telling is a very complicated business, full of moving parts and many cogs engaging. You can\u2019t rely on the Muse to descend and sort it all out for you. A bit of serious forethought about the conclusion will mean you don\u2019t need the Muse\u2019s help at all.</p> <p>William Boyd is a novelist and screenwriter</p> <h2><strong>Know your characters \u2013 Claire Messud</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"24935f9036a36593bce4354c048a441cdc7329f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24935f9036a36593bce4354c048a441cdc7329f2/1970_225_2472_3090/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Lee\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Lee</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee         www.sarahmlee./Sarah Lee</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fiction, character is (almost) everything.

You can\u2019t, of course; but when you filter almost all things through the specificities of character, many questions resolve themselves, almost miraculously.</p> <p>Each of us is, in any given moment, the sum total of our temperament and experiences up to that point. Our baggage and idiosyncrasies may be suggested in our appearance; but much is invisible to the world. We all know that if there are three people in a room, each will tell a different story about what happened there \u2013 so character determines the story itself. But it also determines what will unfold \u2013 the plot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/20/ten-rules-for-writing-fiction-part-one\">Ten rules for writing fiction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a writer, when you create a character, you don\u2019t simply create his exterior (the wispy goatee, the receding hairline, the Liberty print shirt and expensive loafers); you must also come to know who he is (bullied in school, uneasy in friendships, veering between eager to please and cruel; vain but pretending not to be), and what has formed him (a&#xa0;Catholic school in the Sydney suburbs? A comprehensive in Exeter? Born with a silver spoon; or things started off comfortably, but his father\u2019s business failed when he was 11? Raised in the shadow of three older siblings? Or alone with a single mum?). You must know his passions (loves pugs? Bicycle racing? First world war history? Talmudic study?) and his fears.</p> <p>Once you know this person as well as you know yourself (or better), and once you put him, or her, in a particular place in a particular time, your character can only really act (or react) in a limited number of ways. He will notice only certain things, and those things only from a particular perspective; he will interact with others as only he can. If you\u2019re using the first person, or the third person privileging this character, your diction and syntax \u2013 your very writing style \u2013 will be shaped by this person.</p> <p>So much about a character is invisible, in fiction as in real life; but what lies beneath the surface will affect every aspect of your story. If you really take the time to figure out who you\u2019re dealing with, much will become clear.</p> <p>\u2022 Claire Messud is a senior lecturer in creative writing at Harvard</p> <h2>Distance yourself <strong>\u2013 </strong>Tessa Hadley</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"30fb1c1e5825ab71737e56e73d70373bae19272c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30fb1c1e5825ab71737e56e73d70373bae19272c/2187_316_2077_2596/800.jpg\" alt=\"Eamonn McCabe for the Guardian\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eamonn McCabe for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is something I talk about with my students until they\u2019re sick of it: teaching yourself to read your own writing as a reader. It\u2019s very difficult; it makes your mind ache \u2013 not only when you first start trying, but always. Three minutes ago you were tussling down inside the sentences, trying to drag out of the air the perfectly right words to express a mood, or catch a person\u2019s physical presence or a place\u2019s, or trying to find the perfectly right thing for your character to say. Then you blink your eyes, pull back from the screen or the notebook, try to imagine you\u2019ve never seen this writing before.</p> <p>This is the exact equivalent of a painter pulling back from her canvas, squinting at her work, before she dives forward and changes it again. It\u2019s a revelation, really \u2013 how surprisingly visual reading is. Go back a few pages, start reading as if you\u2019ve never seen these words before. How does it seem? Suddenly you\u2019ll see what you couldn\u2019t see when you were down among the undergrowth. It\u2019s going on too long, it\u2019s sentimental, the tone\u2019s too heavy, there are too many sentences with same rhythm, there\u2019s an inadvertent repetition. Or, something\u2019s missing. You could print out your work, to try to see it freshly \u2013 or type it up, if you\u2019re writing longhand. Or you could look at it full screen on the computer, with a different background, more like the pages of a book. The trouble is you have to make this effort not once, but over and over. Your mind will be sore from the effort of reading the same old thing so many times as if it were new. But unless you do it you won\u2019t know what you\u2019ve written, or whether you\u2019ve got it alive and whole, faithfully, on to the page.</p> <p>\u2022 Tessa Hadley is professor of creative writing at Bath Spa University</p> <h2>Don\u2019t be afraid to start again <strong>\u2013 </strong>Jeanette Winterson</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b16d30419aa8e9070e4a6afdfafd682f5152cb56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b16d30419aa8e9070e4a6afdfafd682f5152cb56/2027_657_2409_3011/800.jpg\" alt=\"Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Creativity is inexhaustible.

Day and night, the compulsion to write never leaves him, he says. He can\u2019t rest; can\u2019t forget the unfinished novel he\u2019s meant to be working on; can\u2019t see a cloud in the sky without thinking of a comparison (with a grand piano, say) he might use somewhere; can\u2019t trust the praise of encouragement of friends; feels nervous, miserable, overwrought, half-mad, and when any new work of his appears in print realises that it\u2019s all wrong. Nina doesn\u2019t listen, to her cost. But aspiring writers would do well to heed the warning. To be forever \u201cconsuming your own life\u201d, as Trigorin puts it, is no picnic.</p> <p>But as he also admits, the act itself, when you\u2019re fully immersed, is enjoyable. And to write \u201cin a sort of haze\u201d, unsure what you\u2019re up to but simply compelled, may be no bad thing. Say you sit down to write a poem, or an episode, set on an autumn morning. You have the idea but feel stuck, hamstrung, overwhelmed by your literary forebears: mist and mellow fruitfulness have been done to death. So has woodsmoke but suddenly you\u2019ve the smell in your nostrils and are reminded of (or imagine) a particular fire, logs crackling in a grate, two wine-glasses, a bitter argument, a crimson stain on a sheepskin rug \u2013 perhaps the scene is a winter night rather an autumn morning and the logs are imitation logs in a modern gas fire, but that\u2019s fine, where you\u2019re being taken is more interesting than what you\u2019d planned. Just go with it \u2013 you can always change it later.</p> <p>In other words, if you only write what you\u2019re expecting to write, you\u2019ll be bored. Take a risk. Work against the grain. Don\u2019t be afraid to make a deathbed scene comic, or to show a murderer being kind to animals.

There\u2019s a couple of ways to get around this. Most obviously, you can let yourself off writing as well as you\u2019re possibly able. You can say: \u201cThis is draft zero, not even a first draft, so there\u2019s no need for it to be anything but an exciting mess.\u201d Lots of writing advice is about taking the pressure off by lowering the expectations you have of each draft. That\u2019s the very best part of your very best.</p> <p>A different approach, one I often suggest to writers who are struggling, is to dodge the issue entirely.</p> <p>Instead of writing your novel or story as you, and anticipating all that pressure of owning your work (having friends read it as yours, reading it out in public after being introduced as you), give yourself a pseudonym to work with. Make up the name of a writer you just might have been, if you hadn\u2019t been yourself. Type it in at the top of the manuscript. Print it out. Sign it. (I\u2019m serious.) This draft is no longer by you (at your very best). This draft is by them, whoever they turn out to be.</p> <p>Now, whenever you need to figure something out about your story, from the overall form to the punctuation of a sentence, you can shift responsibility. The question isn\u2019t \u201cHow do I, at my very best, write this?\u201d but \u201cHow does so-and-so write this?\u201d</p> <p>By writing under a secret pseudonym, you will gain a collaborator who has no hang-ups, no responsibilities, no history. They will, I promise, help you write better \u2013 perhaps even better than your very best.</p> <p>\u2022 Toby Litt is a senior lecturer in creative writing at Birkbeck, University of London <strong> </strong></p> <h2>Do your research <strong>\u2013 </strong>Kathryn Hughes</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a30f72955421b1daa3283cee9f7b00bcd398e3bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a30f72955421b1daa3283cee9f7b00bcd398e3bf/507_206_592_739/401.jpg\" alt=\"Graham Turner for the Guardian\" width=\"401\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graham Turner for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s this odd idea that, when it comes to writing non-fiction and biography, all you have to do is get the facts straight in your head and then spool them out in a listless monotone. The experience is rather like sitting next to a pub bore, who starts every sentence with \u201cThe interesting thing is \u2026\u201d without noticing that you\u2019ve already turned away and started to talk to someone else.</p> <p>So it\u2019s all about finding a way to tell your story about the past as if it is actually very present. And, no, that doesn\u2019t mean employing the historic present tense, which is used far too often, and mostly badly. Instead, you need to marinate yourself in your material, consuming everything that you can get your hands on about your subject (we\u2019ll assume you\u2019re writing a biography) and the period in which they lived. Read the books that they read, not just the ones that they actually wrote. Track down their great-great-granddaughter and ask if there any relics (snuffboxes, spectacles diaries, not actual bones) that you could sniff or finger. Saturate yourself in your subject\u2019s correspondence until you know the name of their neighbour\u2019s dog or the date on which their child\u2019s first tooth fell out.</p> <p>Only once you\u2019ve metabolised this material, taken it into your own body, let it settle and mulch inside you for weeks, months or years, will you have a hope of making it live again. The first time you sit down to write, after a period of research immersion, try it freestyle. Don\u2019t hug your notes, or pore over timelines. Write the narrative from memory, letting details float to the front of your imagination, while others recede into the background. With any luck, your narrative will feel fresh and juicy because that is how it lives in your imagination. Only at this point should you go back to your data and make sure that you haven\u2019t invented anything.

It is this seriousness of intent that gives you half a chance of writing something that will have a life beyond your desk. It might be easier to deny this aspect and pretend that you will never get there \u2013 how dare you presume that this folly of a story you are bashing out can be something real, a book for an actual audience, and more to the point, isn\u2019t it very likely you will write a bad ending? You made the whole thing up, after all, and this contraption that we call plot could easily come apart. So goes the insecure writerly mind in the dark hours. But once you believe that you will reach the end of your book, whatever shape that takes, then it can make it easier to write with the kind of conviction and purpose that makes a reader want to turn the page.</p> <p>In <em>Six Walks in the Fictional Woods</em>, the playful and profound series of essays on writing by<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/nov/12/umberto-eco-real-literature-is-about-losers\" title=\"\"> Umberto Eco</a>, he likens the act of reading to playing a game: \u201ca game by which we give sense to the immensity of things that have happened, are happening or will happen in the world\u201d. By saying to yourself that you will complete the story, you are acknowledging the nature of this transaction between yourself and a potential reader \u2013 you are in the game.</p> <p>Of course, your story may never have a reader, but I believe there are very few benefits to thinking in that way. Time and time again I have seen talented students ditch their manuscripts at the half-way point, and less talented students reach the end, rewrite the whole book enthusiastically, and get published.

Pearls seemingly formed between tennis and cocktails, brilliantly deployed by the greats between six and nine every morning but Sunday. Suddenly our biggest hurdle isn\u2019t character, pace or plot, but that we can\u2019t even play tennis.</p> <p>I\u2019m talking about the otherness of our peers. If our toolkit&#xa0;belongs to Fitzgerald and Faulkner, our first issue will&#xa0;be getting over writing relative crap at the outset. But whoever said \u201cwriting is rewriting\u201d knew the science of crap, the practical lesson being: it\u2019s easier to improve it than to originate brilliance. To improve it we need to have it, which means writing it, and that requires a different ethos than the one we probably sat down with, glowing with hope&#xa0;and expectation.</p> <p>My suggestion is this: we stop ourselves from writing what we have to write by pausing to fret over details and risks, and by filtering ourselves through subconscious juries. Sparkles of gold can appear if we just get enough words written, which means write like the wind, don\u2019t look down. Make a pact never to show anyone, build a mound of dirt, skim it later for anything that excites you. Skimming is a different job, sober and honest, of an archaeologist crumbling dirt in her hands.

These might have to do with arresting opening sentences, or they may simply concern the tools of the trade \u2013 character, setting, description, plot. The four words, chosen randomly, are vague descriptive categories once used in literary&#xa0;departments, where, with \u201ctone\u201d, they\u2019ve been abandoned, only to be repeatedly invoked in creative writing classes along with \u201ccraft\u201d, \u201csentence\u201d, and that nervous-making shibboleth, \u201cpoint of view\u201d. I\u2019m not sure what \u201ccharacter\u201d means. Is it an aggregate of physical features \u2013 nose, eyes, hair \u2013 which add up to a bodily presence into which, as if it were a vessel, you pour psychological life: thoughts, memories, political views? Can&#xa0;you \u201cfictionalise\u201d a real person by adding a moustache to his face, or a stammer to his speech?</p> <p>Why is it that, when we invent characters, the process of&#xa0;invention involves an excavation from the subconscious, as if we were trying to remember someone we knew decades&#xa0;ago; while when we write of people we know, we see them in our imagination as independent entities who are&#xa0;essentially strangers to us? To create a character is to unlearn what we know: tips will be unhelpful. Unhelpful, too, is the hierarchy in which these categories arrive, with character at the centre, and setting important inasmuch as&#xa0;it&#xa0;is where plot or story \u2013 or what happens to the protagonist \u2013 unfolds.</p> <p>For me, the protagonist is only one element in a story: evening, room, wall, smoke, car, are other possible ones. It\u2019s a prejudice inherited from the European Renaissance that the human must occupy centre stage, everything else being secondary. A work of the imagination gives us not a protagonist, but the intimation of a world. No one thing in a&#xa0;world \u2013 object or person \u2013 has centrality.</p> <p>If I have one more tip, it\u2019s this: give nothing centrality, because writing is about continually shifting weight from one thing and moment to the other.</p> <p>\u2022 Amit Chaudhuri is professor of contemporary literature at the University of East&#xa0;Anglia</p> <h2>Just do it <strong>\u2013 </strong>Naomi Alderman</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"152354f00ac4a277124f19c8ce7f12d0e55f5e59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/152354f00ac4a277124f19c8ce7f12d0e55f5e59/91_89_271_338/271.png\" alt=\"Naomi Alderman\" width=\"271\" height=\"338\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>You learn the most from sitting down and doing the work, regularly, patiently, sometimes in hope, sometimes despairingly. When you have something that seems complete, show your work to people you trust to be honest&#xa0;but not malicious. Put it aside for six months and reread it. Expect to be disgusted by your own early work. If writing is your vocation, if you hope that it might be your salvation, push on through the disgust until you find&#xa0;one true sentence, a few words that say more than you&#xa0;expected, something you didn\u2019t know until you set it&#xa0;down.</p> <p>There are no \u201ctips\u201d for this process really; it\u2019s painstaking and intense and doesn\u2019t often feel pleasant.</p> <p>However, I think there are tips for how to sit your bum on the chair and do the work.</p> <p>Stop reading so many articles on the internet about how to write. You\u2019re allowed one a week. Instead, spend that time actually writing.</p> <p>Use a writing prompt to get you started. I recommend Judy Reeves\u2019 book <em>A Writer\u2019s Book of Days</em>.</p> <p>Write for 15 minutes every day. Set a time in advance, set&#xa0;a timer. Try to write at the same time every day. Your subconscious will get used to the idea and will start to work like a reliable water spout.</p> <p>Remind yourself, every day, that you\u2019re doing this to try to find something out about yourself, about the world, about words and how they fit together.

I shook my head, as if to shake off my lingering doubts.</p> <p>As I stood up, my heart began to race. I could feel the eyes of the hundreds of audience members on my back: questioning, querying, judging.</p> <p>I turned to face the crowd, lifted up my chin and walked down the main aisle, my pace deliberate. \u201cLook back into the audience,\u201d a friend had texted me moments earlier, \u201cand let them see your face.\u201d</p> <p>The faces around me blurred. As my heels thudded against they grey plastic of the flooring, harmonising with the beat of the adrenaline pumping through my veins, my mind was blank save for one question.</p> <p>\u201cHow is this happening?\u201d</p> <p>So what did happen? What did Shriver say in her keynote that could drive a woman who has heard every slur under the sun to discard social convention and make such an obviously political exit?</p> <p>Her question was \u2014 or could have been \u2014 an interesting question: What are fiction writers \u201callowed\u201d to write, given they will never truly know another person\u2019s experience?</p> <p>Not every crime writer is a criminal, Shriver said, nor is every author who writes on sexual assault a rapist. \u201cFiction, by its very nature,\u201d she said, \u201cis fake.\u201d</p> <p>There is a fascinating philosophical argument here. Instead, however, that core question was used as a straw man. Shriver\u2019s real targets were cultural appropriation, identity politics and political correctness. It was a monologue about the right to exploit the stories of \u201cothers\u201d, simply because it is useful for one\u2019s story.</p> <p>Shriver began by making light of a <a href=\"http://www.pressherald.com/2016/03/04/bowdoin-student-government-to-hold-impeachment-hearings-agaist-two-members/\">recent incident in the US</a>, where students faced prosecution for what was argued by some as \u201ccasual racial and ethnic stereotyping and cultural insensitivity\u201d at a Mexican-themed party.</p> <p>\u201cCan you believe,\u201d Shriver asked at the beginning of her speech, \u201cthat these students were <em>so sensitive</em> about the wearing of sombreros?\u201d</p> <p>The audience, compliant, chuckled. I started looking forward to the point in the speech where she was to subvert the argument.</p> <p>It never came.</p> <p>On and on it went. Rather than focus on the ultimate question around how we can know an experience we have not had, the argument became a tirade. It became about the fact that a white man should be able to write the experience of a young Nigerian woman and if he sells millions and does a \u201cdecent\u201d job \u2014 in the eyes of a white woman \u2014 he should not be questioned or pilloried in any way. It became about <em>mocking</em> those who ask people to seek permission to use their stories. It became a <em>celebration</em> of the <em>unfettered exploitation</em> of the experiences of others, under the guise of fiction. (For more, <a href=\"http://inexorablist.com/dangerous-ideas/\">Yen-Rong, a volunteer at the festival, wrote a summary on her personal blog about it.</a>)</p> <p>It was a poisoned package wrapped up in arrogance and delivered with condescension.</p> <p>As the chuckles of the audience swelled around me, reinforcing and legitimising the words coming from behind the lectern, I breathed in deeply, trying to make sense of what I was hearing. The stench of privilege hung heavy in the air, and I was reminded of my \u201cplace\u201d in the world.</p> <p>See, here is the thing: if the world were equal, this discussion would be different. But alas, that utopia is far from realised.</p> <p>It\u2019s not always OK if a white guy writes the story of a Nigerian woman because the actual Nigerian woman can\u2019t get published or reviewed to begin with. It\u2019s not always OK if a straight white woman writes the story of a queer Indigenous man, because when was the last time you heard a queer Indigenous man tell his own story? How is it that said straight white woman will profit from an experience that is not hers, and those <em>with</em> the actual experience never be provided the opportunity? It\u2019s not always OK for a person with the privilege of education and wealth to write the story of a young Indigenous man, filtering the experience of the latter through their own skewed and biased lens, telling a story that likely reinforces an existing narrative which only serves to entrench a disadvantage they need never experience.</p> <p>I can\u2019t speak for the LGBTQI community, those who are neuro-different or people with disabilities, but that\u2019s also the point. I don\u2019t speak for them, and should allow for their voices and experiences to be heard and legitimised.</p> <p>So access \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 is one piece.</p> <p>But there is a bigger and broader issue, one that, for me, is more emotive. <a href=\"http://racerelations.about.com/od/diversitymatters/fl/What-Is-Cultural-Appropriation-and-Why-Is-It-Wrong.htm\">Cultural appropriation is a \u201cthing\u201d, because of our histories</a>. The history of colonisation, where everything was taken from a people, the world over. Land, wealth, dignity \u2026 and now identity is to be taken as well?</p> <p>In making light of the need to hold onto any vestige of identity, Shriver completely disregards not only history, but current reality. The reality is that those from marginalised groups, even today, do not get the luxury of defining their own place in a norm that is profoundly white, straight and, often, patriarchal. And in demanding that the right to identity should be given up, Shriver epitomised the kind of attitude that led to the normalisation of imperialist, colonial rule: \u201cI want this, and therefore I shall take it.\u201d</p> <p>The attitude drips of racial supremacy, and the implication is clear: \u201cI don\u2019t care what you deem is important or sacred. I want to do with it what I will. Your experience is simply a tool for me to use, because you are less human than me. You are less than human\u2026\u201d</p> <p>That was the message I received loud and clear.</p> <p>My own mother, as we walked away from the tent, suggested that perhaps I was being too sensitive. Perhaps \u2026 or perhaps that is the result of decades of being told to be quiet, and accept our place. So our conversation then turned to intent. What was Shriver\u2019s intent when she chose to discuss her distaste for the concept of cultural appropriation? Was it to build bridges, to further our intellect, to broaden horizons of what is possible?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/12/donald-trump-understanding-american-phenomenon\">Richard Ford, Joyce Carol Oates, David Hare and more ... leading writers on Donald Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her tone, I fear, betrayed otherwise. Humility is not Shriver\u2019s cloak of choice.</p> <p>The kind of disrespect for others infused in Lionel Shriver\u2019s keynote is the same force that sees people vote for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/10/pauline-hanson-is-back-and-its-still-just-as-hard-to-counter-her-rhetoric-with-facts\">Pauline Hanson</a>.

It\u2019s the kind of attitude that lays the foundation for prejudice, for hate, for genocide.</p> <p>The fact Shriver was given such a prominent platform from which to spew such vitriol shows that we as a society still value this type of rhetoric enough to deem it worthy of a keynote address.

From Sotiris Megalos, perched on crags in the south-east, with an old winery and presses, to Agios Emilianos, on a rocky outcrop overlooking a limpid cove in the far west, their locations all inspire awe.</p> <p>Most of Symi\u2019s beaches are equally spectacular, and tantalisingly hard to reach, at least by car. Craggy footpaths and chugging water taxis take you to Nanou, a pebble beach with a tamarisk-shaded shack serving grilled just-caught fish, and Marathounta, where plucky goats will steal your leftovers at the excellent farm-to-table <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/taverna.marathounta\">Taverna Marathounta</a> (about \u20ac25 a head).

In recent years, Tarifa has morphed from a funky party town to a funky party town with stylish accommodation and great eating, too. Most of the good stuff flanks the narrow cobbled streets and tiny plazas crammed inside the town\u2019s thick (somewhat wind-proof) walls.

Heat over a medium flame, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. After 5 minutes, the mixture should come together and a film should form on the bottom of the pan. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and set it aside to cool for a few minutes.

  "<p>When I discovered the theme for my recipe swap, I was grateful and relieved in equal measure. While this classic sweet-but-bitter citrus preserve always has a place at my breakfast table, the supply from my enthusiastic jam-making auntie often outstrips the demand. I\u2019ve experimented to a certain degree (spreading it over a pork shoulder, layering in breakfast pots with creamy Greek yoghurt, swirling through brownie batter), but your suggestions have given me a renewed vigour.</p> <p>In all cases, these recipes have proved to be so much more than the sum of their parts. That characteristic bitterness is just what an indulgent, chocolatey pudding needs to pull it back from the brink of sickly sweet; it pairs perfectly with robust, woody herbs while retaining its character, and, what\u2019s more, a little spike of heat will mean you will be reaching for a spoon at breakfast, lunch and dinner. See this as a chance to think beyond tea and toast.</p> <h2>The winning recipe: <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57bda701e4b0fe30498a458a/5001549\">Marmalade panna cotta with bay and bourbon</a></h2> <p>What I loved most about <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/detoutcoeur%20Limousin\"><em>Detoutcoeur Limousin</em></a>\u2019s panna cotta is that it\u2019s a collection of classic ingredients used to make a crowd-pleasing pudding, but somehow, it tastes exciting and new. It\u2019s creamy, sharp, heady and rich, all in one mouthful, with the warming sweetness of the marmalade giving a good contrast to savoury bay. Using finely shredded marmalade will give a smoother texture.</p> <p><strong>Makes 6</strong><br>3 gelatine leaves<br>250ml double cream<br>400ml creme fraiche<br>100ml whole milk<br>2 bay leaves<br>150g Seville orange marmalade<br>Juice and zest of 1 orange, plus extra zest to serve<br>Zest of 1 lemon<br>2 tbsp bourbon (optional)</p> <p>1 Put the gelatine leaves in a bowl of cold water for around 5 minutes, or until they soften.</p> <p>2 Heat the cream, creme fraiche and milk with the bay leaves and marmalade until it is all just starting to simmer. Remove from the heat and add the zest and juice of an orange and the lemon zest, then simmer for a few minutes until slightly thickened.</p> <p>3 Remove the gelatine from the water, squeezing to remove any excess, then take the cream mixture off the heat and whisk in the gelatine and bourbon, if using. Remove the bay leaves and leave to cool for about 20-30 minutes before pouring into 250ml ramekins, or other serving dishes. Refrigerate to set for about 3-5 hours, or overnight.</p> <p>4 Garnish with a bit of extra orange zest on top of each dessert before serving.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57bda701e4b0fe30498a458a/5001672\"><strong>Chocolate orange bread pudding</strong></a></h2> <p><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/borrowedbread\"><em>Faye Cooke</em></a> says this recipe has won over both bread-and-butter pudding and marmalade haters.

Press down the mixture with the back of a spoon, so that it evenly compacts in the tin and up the sides. Put the base in the fridge to set for at least 1 hour.</p> <p>4 Once the base has set, spoon in 4 tbsp of the marmalade, and evenly spread it out.</p> <p>5 Put the chocolate into a large, heat- proof bowl, then pour the cream into a pan and put on a medium heat until it starts to bubble. Remove the cream from the heat and pour gently and slowly over the chocolate. Whisk the cream and chocolate mixture, until all the chocolate has melted, and the mixture comes together.</p> <p>6 Pour the mixture on top of the tart base, spooning over the last 1 tbsp of marmalade and swirling through when you are done.</p> <p>7 Put the tart in the fridge to set, for at least 3 hours, before slicing and serving.

She\u2019s going to die. She\u2019s having seizures on TV.\u201d</p> <p>Inside, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, stepped up to the podium to warm up the crowd: \u201cA shout out to the military families,\u201d he started. Then \u201ca shout out to our law enforcement professionals\u201d, and finally \u201cto that beautiful flag up there on the wall ... we must respect our flag.\u201d</p> <p>Rudy Giuliani emerged next and set the tone.

Most candidates, traditionally, would be drumming up votes in areas more likely swing blue or red \u2014 Iowa, or Ohio, or even other parts of Florida. </p> <p>But Trump\u2019s methods continue to defy political gravity.

Their song during his last visit to Pensacola became a hit on social media, with lyrics including:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Enemies of freedom</p> <p>Face the music \u2013 come on boys, take \u2019em down!</p> <p>President Donald Trump knows how </p> <p>to make America great</p> <p>Deal from strength or get crushed</p> <p>every time</p> </blockquote> <p>But now the group\u2019s manager and one girl\u2019s father, Jeff Popick, allege Trump \u201cplayed\u201d the girls and didn\u2019t pay them. Last week he filed suit against the campaign, seeking $5,000 to $15,000. </p> <p>The Trump camp has not responded publicly to the suit, but it has 20 days from the receiving it to respond, according to the girls\u2019 lawyer. </p>",

  "<p>Chris Bowen this week set out his plans for winning the fight against the rise of protectionism. It\u2019s a fight in which those in favour of free trade have been shown over the past year \u2013 whether in the Brexit vote or the inability to counter Donald Trump \u2013 to have been completely inept. Among the best aspect of Bowen\u2019s plan of attack is that he has realised one of the reasons for this ineptness has been an over reliance on data and facts.</p> <p>The government\u2019s position on trade essentially operates from the belief that the benefits of free trade are obvious, and thus it is also obvious that more free trade \u2013 in whatever form \u2013 is better.

He too quoted some of the data that pointed to the benefits of free trade, but crucially he argued that they alone were not enough.</p> <p>He suggested that those in favour of free trade needed to win \u201cthe evidence war, the passion war and the fairness and inclusivity war\u201d. It was a crucial acknowledgment that the voice from above, reminding us of the glory days of the reform of the 1980s, is not going to cut it.</p> <p>I love facts as much as anyone, but the problem with the benefits of free trade is that you mostly are talking about cheaper imports.</p> <p>As Bowen noted in his speech, the price of computers, TVs and stereos has declined by 90% over the last 25 years. That sounds great, but when you get to other facts, like for example that we pay less for cars than we did in the early 1990s, it doesn\u2019t take too much thinking to realise the impact of this on the local car industry and its workers.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean free trade is bad but it does highlight how there are winners and losers \u2013 and the data focuses mostly on the winners.</p> <p>Bowen also noted that trade is not the only reason for declining work in such industries as large-scale manufacturing, but that automation is also playing a large and increasing role \u2013 something which greater trade protectionism will do nothing to halt.</p> <p>But this mix of trade, automation, declining employment, and a rise in the lower-paid service sectors, also causes people to believe that free trade only benefits the few, and also leads to inequality.</p> <p>This is not necessarily the case.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://voxeu.org/article/drivers-inequality-trade-versus-tax-rates#.V9Ijxwjz9qQ.twitter\">study this week out of the USA</a> argues that trade is not what causes inequality, but rather, tax and welfare policies are to blame.</p> <p>The impact of such a finding is implicit in Bowen\u2019s argument that \u201cthe more people feel they benefit from our economy, the more they will embrace the system which allows it to grow.\u201d</p> <p>It means you can\u2019t unlink welfare and tax policy from trade policy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jul/11/there-are-economic-benefits-to-free-trade-but-not-for-everyone\">Free trade is viewed as economic catnip, but the benefits are not for everyone | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Arguing for more free trade while also pledging a crackdown on welfare and bemoaning the \u201ctaxed-nots\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/aug/29/scott-morrisons-car-crash-logic-and-the-real-story-behind-the-taxed-nots\">as Morrison did</a>, is just self-defeating.</p> <p>But the path Bowen has chosen, while admirable, remains a rocky one. The difficulty is evident in his speech. He spent much more time talking of the \u201cevidence war\u201d than he did the \u201cpassion, fairness and inclusivity wars\u201d.</p> <p>Similarly he offered little concrete solutions other than the anodyne suggestions of \u201cmore investment in relevant education, training and industry plans\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s why the ALP should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/09/coalitions-plan-to-abolish-welfare-supplement-attacked-by-australia-institute\">reverse its election commitment</a> to cut the $4.40/week energy supplement&#xa0;for those on Newstart.</p> <p>Since the global financial crisis, the drive towards protectionism has gathered pace, but it is wrong to believe it is just a fight about trade.

It\u2019s like the party\u2019s more important than the country.\u201d</p> <p>The program also heard from Caileb Eder, an Indigenous Australian who was prepared to overlook her anti-Indigenous positions because \u201cpeople change over time\u201d and Irene Trewarne, who arrived in Australia as a refugee child, who said she also didn\u2019t \u201cnecessarily like how Pauline expresses herself at times\u201d but gave her a second preference vote because of her \u201cforthrightness\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Attacking her, or patronising her, is likely to be counter-productive and to make her stronger</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/18/pauline-hanson-cant-be-dismissed-this-time-one-nation-is-bigger-than-it-looks\">Essential media research last month</a> showed an astonishing 62% of voters agreed with the statement: \u201cI might not personally agree with everything she says but she is speaking for a lot of ordinary Australians.\u201d</p> <p>Of course many of Hanson\u2019s supporters also fully subscribe to her noxious cocktail of religious and race-based blame, her calls for royal commissions into Islam and bans on new mosques.</p> <p>In the weeks after she secured four Senate seats an impassioned debate broke out among columnists about the best way to respond, with some, like Margo Kingston, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/04/pauline-hanson-takes-centre-stage-again-but-this-time-we-should-listen-not-lampoon\">urging tolerance and conversation</a> and others <a href=\"https://ketanjoshi.co/2016/07/09/brown-proxies-for-economic-anxiety/\">like blogger Ketan Joshi</a> pointing out that \u201cracist sentiment inspired by economic anxiety and political disenfranchisement is still racist\u201d.</p> <p>But the lessons of two decades of Hansonism suggest there can be a point of intersection.</p> <p>Yes, her policies need to be clearly called for what they are. Racist. Divisive. Deeply damaging.
