  "<p>Warm weather and heavy discounts have helped drive a rebound in retail sales, potentially tempering fears of the UK economy grinding to a halt following the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC), published on Tuesday, showed that the value of online and high street sales rose at the fastest pace for six months in the four weeks to 30 July. The statistics chime with other signs that shoppers shrugged off the EU referendum result and continued spending in the weeks that followed. </p> <p>But economists have warned against reading too much into early indicators, while the Bank of England has predicted that growth will slow sharply over coming months, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">cutting interest rates to a record low</a>.</p> <p>July sales were up by 1.1% on a year earlier in like-for-like terms, according to the BRC\u2019s monthly sales monitor, compiled with consultants KPMG. This marked a recovery from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/12/consumer-spending-slows-recession-eu-referendum-retail-sales-bad-weather\">0.5% fall witnessed in June</a> and was the strongest performance since January. In total terms, not adjusting for the effect of new store openings, sales rose by 1.9% in July, also the strongest growth since January.</p> <p>The figures support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/08/uk-consumers-keep-spending-despite-brexit-vote-shock\">consumer spending data from Visa</a> and Barclaycard, which suggested that shopping, day trips and nights out were little affected in the immediate aftermath of the vote to leave the EU. However, they contrast with a survey from the CBI showing that <a href=\"http://news.cbi.org.uk/news/high-street-sales-see-summer-fall/\">retail sales volumes declined in July</a> and a poll from market researchers GfK, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/uk-sees-biggest-fall-in-consumer-confidence-for-26-years-after-brexit-vote\">found that consumer confidence had tumbled</a>. Surveys of businesses are also gloomier, signalling a decrease in activity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/03/uk-services-sector-contraction-adds-to-recession-fears-pmi\">across services, manufacturing and construction</a> since the referendum on 23 June.</p> <p>The BRC said the Brexit vote would pose a challenge for retailers in the months ahead, but for now, shoppers appeared to be taking a \u201clife goes on\u201d approach.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis month\u2019s solid sales figures may come as a shock to some, given the slew of early indicators suggesting that consumer activity was slowing in the wake of the referendum result,\u201d said the BRC chief executive, Helen Dickinson.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, little has materially changed for most UK households [since] 23 June, so it is not surprising to us that sales are simply responding to their normal underlying drivers.\u201d</p> <p>Reflecting the pattern of low inflation throughout 2016, the BRC said retailers were continuing to rely on promotions to keep people shopping. Intense price competition has made it hard for retailers to grow their takings and the BRC\u2019s measure of sales growth on a 12-month average basis held at 1.2% in July, the weakest since May 2009, when the UK was mired in recession.</p> <p>Dickinson said the big question for retailers was whether the stronger performance in July could be carried forward into full price sales. </p> <p>A mini heatwave last month helped raise food and drink sales for barbecues and picnics, and also lifted fashion sales, the BRC said. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-08T14:34:42/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Value of pound against dollar\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-08T14:34:42/embed.html\">Value of pound against dollar</a> </figure>  <p>There was also evidence of a boost to retailers and tourism from the weaker pound, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/06/brexit-pound-plunges-to-30-year-lows-as-eu-fears-bite-into-global-markets-again\">fallen sharply since the referendum</a>. Holidays, as a result, are more expensive for Britons going abroad, but coming to the UK is cheaper for foreign tourists.</p> <p>The BRC report noted a pickup in sales of jewellery and watches as some tourists were drawn to the UK for shopping splurges.</p> <p>Separate figures suggested that flight bookings to the UK jumped after the referendum, driven by demand from customers in the US and Asia Pacific. In the 28 days before the vote, flight reservations had been down 2.8% year on year. However, in the month after the referendum, they were up by 4.3%, according to travel research company ForwardKeys.</p> <p>Spending was also helped last month by people finding money to go out with friends and family, despite feeling more nervous about the economic outlook, according to figures from Barclaycard.</p> <p>It reported that consumer spending grew by 2.6% in July on a year earlier, but this was down from growth of 3.6% in May and June.<br></p> <p>Spending in pubs was up by 12.2%, restaurants enjoyed a 12.8% rise and cinema spending increased by 10.1%, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/03/absolutely-fabulous-the-movie-review-jennifer-saunders-joanna-lumley\">Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie</a> and Ghostbusters helped draw in customers, following a lull in June.</p> <p>Barclaycard also polled 1,680 people to gauge consumer confidence, of whom 63% said they had carried on spending as they did before the Brexit vote. But half of those polled said they were not confident in their ability to spend more on nonessential items, the highest proportion since February. </p> <p>Paul Lockstone, the managing director of corporate affairs at Barclaycard, said: \u201cThese are the first full month\u2019s figures since the EU referendum, so it\u2019s too early to say if this is the start of a long-term trend, but it seems likely consumers will be watching the external environment carefully ahead of any major spending decisions.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The first the Maria Lenk aquatic centre knew of Tom Daley and Daniel Goodfellow\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/tom-daley-dan-goodfellow-rio-platform-diving-bronze\">bronze medal</a> in the 10 metre platform dive was a screeching cry from the Team GB coach Jane Figuero a microsecond before the arena itself erupted.</p> <p>For Daley and Goodfellow, the pursuit of the leaders had come down to the very last knockings, the final dive of 36 in a gruellingly high-end competition. Picked out for a moment against the grey fuzz of the evening sky, they paused, charged and hurled themselves into a final back 3.5 somersault pike, producing under extreme pressure a genuinely beautiful moment of plunging synchronicity. </p> <p>As they surfaced, Daley hugged Goodfellow, eyes fixed now on the scoreboard at the far end. Then came the scream, the cheers, the row of 9s and 8.5s, and a lovely spontaneous arm-in-arm plunge into the shallows.</p> <p>For Daley, this was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2012/aug/11/olympics-2012-tomdaley\">second Olympic bronze</a>, and an unarguable sporting vindication for a British athlete whose extreme achievements can be obscured for some by his glitz, his televisual burnish, his celebrity six-pack. The fact remains, though, that in an era of Chinese dominance, Britain has a self-made bona fide diving heavyweight, a lively, likeable pop-kid of the high board who has now won exactly 50% of Britain\u2019s Olympic diving medals since the 1920s.</p> <p>It is a success all the more remarkable for the fact that Daley\u2019s entire career, from dinky fresh-faced teenager to dinky fresh-faced adult, has been played out in that superstar diving-boy glare. In the buildup here, even his trunks have been a topic of fascination, with reports of Daley seeking an audience with Stella McCartney during design process to reconfigure the precise flow and stretch of his pouch. His attention will now refocus ahead of the individual competition starting a week on Friday. Don\u2019t expect Daley to blink. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/08/tom-daley-dan-goodfellow-bronze-medal-great-britain-diving-synchronised-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q436\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2640525\"            data-video-name=\"Tom Daley and Dan Goodfellow secure bronze for Great Britain \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a8ea75e4b03b51a99e133e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/mainwebsite/2016/08/08/160808MenDiving_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/HLS/2016/08/08/160808MenDiving.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/webM/2016/08/08/160808MenDiving_V3.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/08/tom-daley-dan-goodfellow-bronze-medal-great-britain-diving-synchronised-video\">Tom Daley and Dan Goodfellow secure bronze for Great Britain</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It was a late-breaking success built from a steady start. As the divers marched out on the poolside in their tracksuits, there were cheers and whistles around a half-full arena. The Maria Lenk is an intimate little water park on the far edge of Rio\u2019s Olympic Park with the hills of suburbs poking in above the lip of the stand. Open to the air, built on top of an old military complex, it is a slightly eerie corner of the park with a Ballardian murkiness to its endless corridors and gantries and grey-beige interiors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fd2e55846353977052b1fb335599b4be0c98147\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fd2e55846353977052b1fb335599b4be0c98147/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Daley (left) and Daniel Goodfellow (right).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Daley (left) and Daniel Goodfellow (right).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Daley and Goodfellow were down to dive last through the six rounds of escalating difficulty, the ultimate test of a routine honed over months of training, during which Goodfellow has moved to London to live with Daley, the two men forming an unusually tight bond both on and away from the board.</p> <p>As the divers strode mournfully forward to complete their plunge, oddly stark up there on the highest board, it was striking what a strange activity diving is in isolation. Most sports involve the need to run or fight or leap. In diving it is only contortions during a descent governed by non-negotiable gravity. These are the human race\u2019s masters of falling.</p> <p>The Russians went first, Victor Minibaev and Nikita Shleikher performing a pared back backwards somersault that seemed to hang as they plunged down out of the grey, past the pyramid of blue-blazered judges. Later a mediocre set of scores for the Ukrainians was whistled and booed, as was the row of eights for the Brazilian pair. The rhythm was gripping: a blast of disco music, a fluster of applause, whistles at the appearance of the two small, bronzed figures at the mouth of the top board, then the hush, the craned necks, the thud of entry.</p> <p>Finally Daley and Goodfellow emerged for their opener, kicking off with an inward 1.5 somersault pike. As they paused and stretched, a flock of seabirds flew by cawing at the end of the stadium, a reminder of the background fog of complaints and gripes around these Olympic Games that has become a mini-industry in itself, fed with blaring accounts of each malfunctioning vending machine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1809f2dc08b6182da0ad008288e8ff652161769\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1809f2dc08b6182da0ad008288e8ff652161769/0_139_4560_2735/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Daley shows his coach Jane Figuereido the bronze medal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Daley shows his coach Jane Figuereido the bronze medal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Maria Lenk arena has had its problems too, mainly focused on mosquito issues, driven by the fertile breeding ground of a nearby stagnant lagoon. There have been misgivings among the divers about competing outdoors, with all its variables of sunlight and wind. Here it was a muggy, slightly unsettling day, with a low fuzz of bruised cloud clinging over the hills behind the board. Undisturbed by the birds, Daley and Goodfellow produced a solid effort that took them to third place. <br></p> <p>And so it went on, the Chinese pair Aisen Chen and Yue Lin pulling away steadily on the board, ahead of the agreeably expressive Mexicans, who went through a kind of psyching-up routine before some of their dives, unusual in this most mannered and stately of water sports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea46e7197b1b2c33a819fc75e90a3b20cc12fc6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea46e7197b1b2c33a819fc75e90a3b20cc12fc6a/0_0_3135_2013/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daley and Goodfellow took bronze, with China in the lead and the US team taking silver.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daley and Goodfellow took bronze, with China in the lead and the US team taking silver.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Daley and Goodfellow were a little looser with their reverse 1.5 somersault twist, a telling distance opening up mid-fall between those whirling torsos. The Chinese, immaculate in gleaming red trunks, swatted aside their first really difficult dive as the stakes rose. The British pair dropped to fifth as Mexico and Germany surged. Daley and Goodfellow shook their heads, retreating pensively to the poolside hot tub.</p> <p>The key moment arrived with China\u2019s fifth dive of six, the round during which the stakes are upped, and difficulties go through the roof. Chen and Yue took the judges for 9.5s and 10s, emerging from the water punching the air and whooping after four previous dives during which the favourites had remained sombre and reserved. Gold looked a certainty, the challenge for Daley and Goodfellow was to follow their vapour trail.</p> <p>So to the final round. The Americans, David Boudia and the brilliantly named Steele Johnson, claimed silver with another immaculate dive, hugging with real feeling as they left the water. At which point, enter Daley and Goodfellow and a leap at the last into British Olympic history.</p>",

At the weekend, the 21/11/15 to be specific. I had a freak accident on vault. I went wonky on a yuchenko and landed with one leg on the landing matts (right leg) the other on the concrete (left leg) which left me with a broken leg both tibia &amp; Fibia. I had to have surgery shortly after. The pain as excruciating as it was I could handle, but the disappointment &amp; heart break from going from such a high at the world championships to the lowest low after a little mishap was very hard for me.  all my emotions just erupted and I&#39;ve found myself constantly In tears. This may be a big stepping stone to overcome but most if not all successful athletes have had to overcome adversity to reach their goals. That moment at the world championships I will never forget &amp; it&#39;s something I want to feel again. So after my recovery stage I will be grinding to get myself back better than I have ever been.

The beautiful thing about gymnastics is that it doesn\u2019t matter: marvelling at athletes simply overcoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/fabian-hambuchen-gynastics-injuries-samir-ait-said-andreas-toba\">the dangers of flipping and twisting</a> several metres off the ground, pushing the limit of human strength, balance, flexibility and grace is more enough.</p> <p>But if you are from one of China, USA, Russia, Japan, Great Britain, Brazil, Ukraine or Germany, you\u2019ve got a little extra to get excited about. From the Ryder Cup in golf to the Davis Cup in tennis, team competitions seem to light a fire in fans like nothing else. Today\u2019s men\u2019s team final is made up of the eight countries, each with five gymnasts in their ranks, who will take it in turns to each perform one of six different disciplines: vault, floor, pommel horse, rings, parallel bars and horizontal bars.</p> <p>Each individual score will then be added to the team\u2019s total. Every routine counts: less than 2.5 points divided the top six qualifiers for this final, so every athlete is just one disaster from potentially costing their county a medal.</p> <p>The field is tight this year. China, winners in 2012, are widely tipped as the favourites. In Kohei Uchimura, Japan have arguably the best all-round athlete and won team gold the world championships in Glasgow last year. The USA team finished top of the medal table overall in Glasgow, but have a team comprised of specialists. Team GB may have been chuffed with bronze at London 2012, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/05/max-whitlock-louis-smith-team-gb-gymnastics-rio-olympics-2016\">have gone from strength to strength since</a>, and will hope to improve: they won silver in Glasgow.

That is the slowest recovery since 1949, by which point the US had emerged from the great depression; the financial crisis of 2008 was the worst since the stock market crash that began the great depression.</p> <p><strong>\u201cThere are now 93.4 million Americans outside of the labor force. I</strong><strong>t was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of 14 million.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump cited accurate <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS15000000\">BLS figures</a>, and he was almost correct on the difference between 93.4 and 80.5. But he neglected to mention that more than five million people have also joined the labor force since Obama took office in 2009. He also neglected to mention demographics; the baby boomer generation is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/113th-congress-2013-2014/reports/45011-LaborMarket-OneCol.pdf\">retiring</a> out of the workforce. </p> <p><strong>\u201cHome ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump has this figure correct: as of the second quarter this year, 62.9% of households owned a home, down from 63.4%, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/us-homeownership-rate-629-percent-matches-51-year-40959325\">according to the Census Bureau.</a></p> <p><strong>\u201cMore than 12 million people have been added to the food stamp.\u201d</strong></p> <p>As of April 2016, <a href=\"http://frac.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/snapdata2016-apr.pdf\">43,571,080 people </a>were enrolled in the Snap assistance program, according to the Food Research and Action Center, meaning an increase of about 12 million from December 2008, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-foodstamps-usa-idUSTRE4B28CB20081203\">when 31.5 million Americans were enrolled</a>. But 14.7 million people enrolled for food assistance under George W Bush, with a 17% increase from 2007 to 2008 alone.</p> <p><strong>\u201cFifty-eight per cent of the African American youth are either outside of the labor force or not employed.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Unemployment rates for young African Americans with a high school degree \u2013 17 to 20 years old \u2013 are high, according to <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/blog/young-black-high-school-grads-face-astonishing-underemployment/\">the Economic Policy Institute</a>. But EPI\u2019s figures are slightly different from Trump\u2019s: the institute places this very specific demographic at 19.5% unemployed and 37% \u201cunderemployed\u201d; for young college-aged graduates (21-24), unemployment is 7.2% and underemployment 14.9%. These are still startlingly higher than the population for other Americans, but not the same figure cited by Trump.</p> <p><strong>\u201cThe 5% [unemployment] figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern American politics.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump provided no evidence for this claim, and has for months asserted that real unemployment could be as high as 42%.  </p> <p>He is correct to point out that people who aren\u2019t looking for work are a longstanding concern \u2013 but the BLS has a statistic for that too, called \u201clabor underutilization\u201d. In July, <a href=\"http://unemploymentdata.com/current-u6-unemployment-rate/\">this broader rate was 10.1%</a>, twice the unemployment number but still far below its rate five years ago \u2013 it was as high as 15.2% in December 2011.</p> <p><strong>\u201cThe United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35% ... \u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump adjusted his previous false claim that the US is one of the highest taxed countries in the world to a more specific and more correct one, about corporate tax rates \u2013 which he elides slightly by calling a \u201cbusiness tax rate\u201d. The US corporate income tax rate does rank among the highest among industrialized nations, <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLE_II1\">according to the OECD</a>.

He failed to mention that a major factor in this decline was the rise of natural gas, solar and wind industries, which had an employment increase of 175,000 jobs. Natural gas, especially, cut into the coal industry.</p> <p><strong>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150bn to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400m in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment.\u201d</strong></p> <p>The US has not given $150bn to Iran; it released billions of Iran\u2019s money frozen by sanctions related to the country\u2019s nuclear program. Estimates vary regarding how much of that money Iran will actually see: the treasury secretary, Jack Lew, has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?327246-1/secretaries-kerry-moniz-lew-testimony-iran-nuclear-agreement\">put the number at $56bn</a>, Iranian officials between <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2016/01/19/446415/Iran-32bn-unfrozen-assets\">$32bn</a> and<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-claims-100-billion-now-freed-in-major-step-as-sanctions-roll-back/2016/02/01/edfc23ca-c8e5-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html\">$100bn</a>.</p> <p>Similarly, the $400m in question stems from a dispute over a failed arms deal in the late 1970s, which has been under arbitration at the Hague for decades. The money was delivered in foreign currency because it is illegal under US law to have transactions with Iran in US dollars, and because remaining sanctions are major obstacles to global banks. A small group of US sailors was captured the same month of the scheduled delivery, and released less than a day later.</p>",

In 2013, the US supreme court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/jun/25/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-obama\">struck at the heart</a> of the 1965 law in a 5-4 decision that allowed nine states, mostly in the south, to make changes to electoral rules without approval from federal authorities in Washington. </p> <p>The prevailing justices argued that while racial discrimination persisted, it was no longer sufficient to justify what they called \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d against the southern states. The states included Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia.</p> <p>Civil rights activists were deeply disappointed by the ruling, and have been at the forefront of fighting a surge of voter identification laws which have passed in some of the nine states, which they say amounts to voter suppression and targets racial minorities.</p> <p>\u201cYou can vote with an ID that allows you to carry a concealed weapon, but a card that allows you to carry a book of Shakespeare or a textbook does not allow you to vote,\u201d Brooks said, expressing frustration that in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2016/aug/03/citing-court-victories-elsewhere-tennessee-de/379235/\">some states</a> a handgun permit, but not a library card, can be presented as identification at polling booths. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/north-carolina-voting-rights-law-republicans-november-elections\">string of legal victories last month</a>, courts in five states ruled against voter ID and proof-of-citizenship laws.

  "<p>Somewhere out there is a swimmer capable of reeling in Katie Ledecky, the great white shark of the Rio pool. The only snag is that, on current evidence, it may not happen for a while. Overshadowing the vast medal haul of her prolific male counterpart, Michael Phelps, will be difficult but there is no mistaking the biggest dorsal fin in the women\u2019s competition.</p> <p>Already she has a gold and a silver medal here in Brazil, with every prospect of carving up the field again in her remaining two individual events, the 200m and 800m freestyle. After getting to bed at 2.45am following her previous evening\u2019s stunning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/michael-phelps-usa-swimming-katie-ledecky-rio-2016\" title=\"\">world record in the 400m freestyle</a>, she was a tad sluggish in her morning heat of the 200m but was still comfortably the quickest semi-final qualifier, leaving the four-times 2012 gold medallist Missy Franklin to scramble home 12th fastest. Even Ledecky\u2019s bad days tend to compare favourably to other people\u2019s best ones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/michael-phelps-headphones-music-swimming-olympics-rio\">What is Michael Phelps listening to on his trademark Olympics headphones?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To listen to her in the mixed zone afterwards, inches away from a heaving scrum of reporters who would struggle to win a race in their own bathtubs, was also to be reminded that, at 19, she has been building intently towards this week for a long time. She opted not to go for broke at the US Olympic trials, concentrating instead on honing the strong, chopping rhythm that sets her apart from her peers. \u201cMy stroke feels better than it ever has,\u201d she said, after recording a time of 1min 55.01sec. \u201cOnce I get going it\u2019s kind of hard to stop.\u201d</p> <p>It was a distinctly ominous quote from a distinctly short-odds favourite, who smashed her own world record on Sunday evening in a time of 3:56.46. Team GB\u2019s silver medallist, Jazz Carlin, did well to stay in the frame but acknowledged afterwards it was a mentally difficult place to be. \u201cIt is tough being next to Katy. You\u2019re not sure what she\u2019s going to do because she has so much speed.\u201d</p> <p>All her opponents can do is hang in there and hope. There are some fine swimmers in the women\u2019s 200m butterfly, including Italy\u2019s Federica Pellegrini, who has held the world record in this event since 2009, Australia\u2019s Emma McKeon and Sweden\u2019s golden girl, Sarah Sjostrom, but there is widespread acknowledgement that something extra special will be required in the final. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the fastest race in history,\u201d predicted Pellegrini.</p> <p>Even if Ledecky somehow falls short these are developing into an increasingly good Games for US swimming, who have also tasted success in the men\u2019s 100m relay with Phelps among their ranks. It was another remarkable effort, although Phelps did show some unaccustomed signs of mortality when he finished a modest third in his heat of the 100m butterfly behind Hungary\u2019s Tamas Kenderesi and Grant Irvine of Australia.

The process is meant to draw blood to the affected area, reduce soreness and accelerate the healing of overworked muscles but leaves rather unsightly love-bite style marks on the skin. Phelps\u2019s explanation was that his trainer had simply been a touch over-enthusiastic. \u201cThat\u2019s where I usually hurt the most. I\u2019ve done it before meets, pretty much every meet I go to. I just asked for a little cupping because I was sore. The trainer hit me pretty hard with one and left a couple of bruises.\u201d</p> <p>The proof will be in the low-calorie pudding as Phelps attempts to prove that the old irresistible magic is still there. He is well aware, however, that he will have to crank things up to guarantee a medal in the 200m butterfly having clocked 1:55.73. \u201cI\u2019ve been a little off on my predictions to make it into semis and final. I was thinking 1:57 would make it in this morning, but I saw a couple of 1:55s. I wanted to be somewhere in the front of the heat.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere, Britain\u2019s Siobhan-Marie O\u2019Connor cruised into the semi-finals of the women\u2019s 200m individual medley, second only to Hungary\u2019s eye-catching quick Katinka Hosszu, who set an Olympic record in her heat. Hannah Miley, having just missed out on a medal on Saturday, qualified 12th fastest. The 17-year-old Georgie Coates and her team-mate Ellie Faulkner both bowed out in the 200m freestyle heats.</p>",
  "<p>The chimney stack stands idle, grass sprouts through cracks in the empty car park, and an aging sign \u2013 \u201cJanesville people working together; quality; pride; worldwide\u201d \u2013 mocks what used to be. The sprawling General Motors plant in Janesville, Wisconsin, closed down eight years ago with thousands of job losses, but a pub that once did a roaring trade serving workers on the assembly line is clinging on.</p> <p>On Sunday evening a dozen or so locals at the Zoxx 411 Club drank, played darts or leaned on the bar, which incorporates old GM and Fisher Body metal badges. \u201cWe lost our house and car,\u201d said Diane Nordeng, 67, whose husband Robert was laid off by GM after 19 years. \u201cHe got very depressed. He stayed in all day and didn\u2019t socialise or go out anywhere. It\u2019s been very difficult for the families. A lot of people thought Janesville would completely go under but they\u2019re trying hard to stay alive.\u201d</p> <p>Scenarios like this \u2013 industrial decline, job losses, hollowed-out communities \u2013 across the country are widely thought to be fodder for the populism of Donald Trump. The Republican nominee, who laid out his economic strategy on Monday, has been dubbed a \u201cblue-collar billionaire\u201d. But Janesville, and Wisconsin more broadly, suggest Trump is struggling to overcome pockets of resistance even, or especially, within his own party.</p> <p>Paul Ryan, who as speaker of the House is the most senior elected Republican in the land, is up for re-election in his own backyard on Tuesday. The Janesville resident is being challenged by Paul Nehlen, a maverick businessman from out of state seeking to ride the Trump wave (\u201cblue-collar makes it to VP of Fortune 500\u201d, says his Twitter account), in a primary election to decide which Republican will contest the House seat for Wisconsin\u2019s first congressional district in November.<br></p> <p>Ryan was bitterly criticised at the time of the GM plant shutdown, and again in 2012 when, running for vice-president, he tried to pin the blame on Barack Obama. Nehlen, like Trump, has railed against factory closures, promised to \u201crepatriate\u201d jobs to the US and branded Ryan a \u201csoulless globalist\u201d. In a year of voter rebellion against the Washington establishment, the stage might have appeared set for a stunning upset. But it is not going to turn out that way.</p> <p>A poll last week by the Remington Research Group put Ryan on 80% and Nehlen on just 14%. Charlie Sykes, a conservative talkshow host, said: \u201cRyan is going to win overwhelmingly. Paul Nehlen is absurdly over-hyped by certain elements of the conservative media. They created a virtual candidate, but it looks completely different from here.\u201d</p> <p>Such is the power of Twitter and Trump that it took just a 10-word tweet from the candidate \u2013 \u201cThanks to @pnehlen for your kind words, very much appreciated\u201d \u2013 last Monday to catapult Nehlen from obscurity to the news networks. A day later, Trump told the Washington Post that he was \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d when it came to endorsing Ryan and praised Nehlen for running \u201ca very good campaign\u201d. But on Friday, the brash billionaire finally gave his backing to Ryan at a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin,<strong> </strong>from which Nehlen, who had driven three hours to attend, was humiliatingly ejected.</p> <p>When Nehlen arrived at the Trump rally he was informed that he could not attend because he did not have a ticket. \u201cThey said you can\u2019t come in here, they brought a detective \u2013 I don\u2019t know what it was,\u201d Nehlen told the Washington Post the following day.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s belated and somewhat grudging endorsement of Ryan was important for keeping up appearances of party unity. But it seems unlikely to make much difference in a congressional district where Trump lost to rival Ted Cruz by 19 percentage points in the Republican primaries. Indeed, Wisconsin as a whole inflicted Trump\u2019s worst setback of that campaign and has never embraced him. Before his plane touched down last Friday, state assembly speaker Robin Vos wrote in an open letter: \u201cWe are Ryan Republicans here in Wisconsin, not Trump Republicans.\u201d It is now set to play a central role in what many regard as civil war within the party.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-endorses-paul-ryan-wisconsin-rally\">Donald Trump endorses Paul Ryan after previously refusing to back him</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Along with Ryan, Scott Walker, the governor of the state who launched an abortive bid for the presidency this year, and Reince Priebus, chair of the Republican National Committee, grew up in southern Wisconsin. All are close in age and share a political worldview. Now the triumvirate is wrestling with the Trump problem: what to do with a wildly unpredictable candidate who recently insulted the family of a dead soldier and who regularly stretches conservative orthodoxy to breaking point.</p> <p>David Brooks, a columnist for the New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/opinion/trumps-enablers-will-finally-have-to-take-a-stand.html\">wrote</a> last week of the Republican leadership: \u201cThere comes a time when neutrality and laying low become dishonorable. If you\u2019re not in revolt, you\u2019re in cahoots. When this period and your name are mentioned, decades hence, your grandkids will look away in shame.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan has condemned some of Trump\u2019s statements while still backing his candidacy. Sykes, who has known Ryan since he was first elected to the House in 1998, said: \u201cI think he has struggled with it from the beginning. He knows who Donald Trump is and what he\u2019s about. It\u2019s an exquisitely complicated dilemma for him. I think he sees it as at a responsibility to the party because he\u2019s speaker of the House. If he wasn\u2019t speaker of the House, there would be no way he\u2019d be supporting him. This is a deeply painful dilemma for him.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan is keenly aware that the Trump effect could cost Republicans the Senate and inflict losses in the House. Sykes added: \u201cHe\u2019s worried about what could have been. Ryan\u2019s a policy wonk. He always said if this election is about ideas, we will win; if it\u2019s about personalities, we will lose. It\u2019s an election entirely about personalities.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Dump Paul Ryan\u2019</h2> <p>In this spirit, Nehlen, 47, the vice-president of a water filtration company, has attempted to channel Trump during his primary campaign, laying bare the party\u2019s inner turmoil. Just as the Republican convention heard from family members of people killed by undocumented immigrants, a move that many observers found tasteless and exploitative, so Nehlen arranged for a group of women whose children had been killed in similar circumstances to wield photos outside Ryan\u2019s home. In another stunt, Nehlen stood before a yellow construction dump truck that bore the words \u201cDump Paul Ryan\u201d and \u201cGet the dirt on Ryan\u201d.</p> <p>Nehlen has accused Ryan of acting against Wisconsin\u2019s workers by shipping jobs to China, bringing in cheap labour and keeping the borders open. He has echoed Trump\u2019s call to build a wall along the Mexican border and gone even further in suggesting the deportation of \u201csharia-compliant\u201d Muslims. All this earned him the backing of Tom Tancredo, a former congressman from Colorado and hardliner on immigration.</p> <p>Tancredo, 70, head of the Team America political action committee, argues that Trump should not have caved into party pressure to back Ryan. \u201cTrump is dangerous to Paul Ryan\u2019s position on issues and the Chamber of Commerce that he represents,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump is scary for him. I think Trump made a mistake in supporting Paul Ryan and John McCain. If he\u2019s elected, his ability to achieve his agenda is compromised by their presence there.\u201d</p> <p>There is little hope of healing divisions in the party any time soon, Tancredo added. \u201cTrump should have picked someone for vice-president that the establishment hates even more than him because that\u2019s the only way he\u2019ll avoid getting impeached by a Republican Congress. If he goes ahead with an executive action on controlling the border, I think he will be impeached. He comes from the most vulnerable group in America: wealthy old white males.\u201d</p> <p>Nehlen also earned the backing of arch-conservative heroines Sarah Palin, Ann Coulter and Michelle Malkin, as well as Tea Party activists hoping for a repeat of the primary surprise that ousted then House majority leader Eric Cantor. But it is to little effect against Ryan, \u201ca fifth-generation Wisconsinite\u201d who makes much of his local roots.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/donald-trump-committed-fans-poll-drop-us-election\">\u2018I\u2019m still for him\u2019: Trump fans undaunted by string of campaign blunders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Attending a Serbian cultural festival over the weekend, he told the Washington Post: \u201cWisconsin Republicans are good at sniffing out interlopers. These tactics that they\u2019re employing, which are basically scam Pacs and hoax campaigns, inventing myths like I\u2019m for open borders and the rest, just don\u2019t really fly. It\u2019s unnerving to people because it\u2019s not how we treat each other in Wisconsin.\u201d</p> <p>In Janesville, a bridge connects pleasant suburban housing, parks, playgrounds, a golf course and the Rotary Botanic Garden to the old neighbourhood of the GM plant, where paint peels off abandoned buildings. GM once employed 7,000 people and was the biggest job provider in the area for decades. A study found that its employees and those whose wages were tied to that production contributed $220m to the local economy. Brad Dutcher, 49, who was president of the local United Automobile Workers branch at the time, said: \u201cThat tremendous amount of influx that went away in a very short period of time had dire effects on the community, small businesses began to close, property values fell, school districts suffered and families began to relocate to other GM facilities across the country.\u201d</p> <p>Many workers at the factory are Democratic voters with fond memories of the Bill Clinton years. Dutcher added: \u201cOurs was not the first automotive factory to close under Paul Ryan\u2019s watch within his district; the Chrysler plant in the Milwaukee area ceased production also. Representative Ryan\u2019s failure to take on the big oil industry had a huge effect, in my opinion, on the decision to close our plant. We produced large SUVs and fuel prices were upwards of $3 a gallon.</p> <p>\u201cHis position on tax loopholes for corporations that move work out of the United States could also be tied to the closure. GM had, and still does [have], a truck factory in Mexico that produced the same SUVs that were made in Janesville, obviously at a substantially lower labour rate.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Trump, and his acolyte Nehlen, are still struggling to gain a foothold in the district. Dutcher said: \u201cThe Republican party has made the bed that they must now lie in. They chose to let the extreme right dictate their agenda and now they are saddled with a nominee that, quite frankly, is an embarrassment to most Americans.\u201d</p> <p>Nordeng, a great-grandmother who commutes two hours a day to work as a security officer, has plenty of reasons for discontent but will not turn to the bombastic tycoon. \u201cTrump can talk till the cows come home but look at his history and the way he treated people,\u201d she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t leave a good impression.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people are following the crowd when it comes to Trump. A lot of people don\u2019t like him. Paul Ryan would be a better choice. If Ryan were running, he would win.\u201d</p>",

But aside from the subject matter, the Wild Cards series was also innovative in its construction. Martin and his co-editor Melinda Snodgrass used a variety of big-name science fiction and fantasy authors to compile a shared universe that wasn\u2019t quite a short story anthology and not quite a collaborative piece but something in between \u2013 what they called a \u201cmosaic novel\u201d, with different stories featuring different characters written by different writers, but interlocking into a wider narrative.</p> <p>The high concept of the Wild Cards series was that at the height of the second world war an alien virus was unleashed on the world \u2013 initially over New York \u2013 which changed the course of history. Ninety percent of those exposed to the virus died instantly, but of those 10 in 100 who survived, nine were horribly disfigured \u2013 they drew the \u201cjoker\u201d, in the parlance of the series \u2013 while just 1% were dealt an \u201cace\u201d and gifted with comic-book-style superpowers.</p> <p>From this divergent point in the alternate history, Martin, Snodgrass and their legion of writers, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cadigan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Pat Cadigan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cheriepriest.com/\">Cherie Priest</a>, X-Men comic writer <a href=\"http://www.chrisclaremont.com/\">Chris Claremont</a> and the late <a href=\"http://www.georgerrmartin.com/about-george/friends/in-memoriam-roger-zelazny/\">Roger Zelazny</a>, crafted a cohesive world that has the magic of the comic books it echoes but none of the continuity issues gathered over several decades.</p> <p>As Martin points out, the Wild Cards universe is at least as populous as Westeros, giving the producers of the forthcoming TV adaptation a huge tapestry of stories to go at. The first volume in 1986 introduced Doctor Tachyon, a benign and extravagantly attired member of the alien race that unleashed the virus in 1941; the Great and Powerful Turtle, who used his telekinetic abilities to encase himself in a flying shell; Cap\u2019n Trips, who employed hallucinogenics to turn on to his super abilities; and Jetboy, a pulp-ish fighter ace who tried to save the world from the virus released over Manhattan.</p> <p>Alongside these Aces are the grotesque and deformed Jokers, forced into ghettos, subjected to bigotry and hatred and even becoming the subject of 1960s civil rights fights in the alternate reality of the Wild Cards timeline.</p> <p>As well as the books, Wild Cards has been adapted into comics (of course) and <a href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/Roleplayer/Roleplayer16/WildCards.html\">role-playing games</a> \u2013 indeed, the whole concept grew out of superhero RPG sessions played by Martin and Snodgrass \u2013 but will it work as a TV series?</p> <p>It seems difficult to see how it will fail. With Martin\u2019s name attached to it, it\u2019s certainly going to attract curious Game of Thrones fans, even if they have no familiarity with the source material. And despite some lukewarm reviews for the latest comic book movies, especially DC\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/man-of-steel-2\">Batman v Superman</a> and its newest release, Suicide Squad, the public\u2019s appetite for celluloid superheroes seems to continue unabated.</p> <p>Wild Cards also has the benefit of a fanbase that\u2019s been growing for 30 years \u2013 there are now 22 books \u2013 and a concerted effort from the outset to keep tight control over continuity, meaning the TV producers won\u2019t have to wade through decades of comics history to work out how to fit the disparate elements all together.</p> <p>Add to all that, Wild Cards is actually great. There have been many attempts over the past few years to answer the question: \u201cWhat if superheroes existed in the real world?\u201d But this series gives it a better shot than pretty much anything else. Wild Cards seems such an obvious choice for TV adaptation that the only real surprise in George RR Martin\u2019s announcement is why it\u2019s taken so long.</p>",
  "<p>The aftermath of the Brexit referendum has taken me back to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/philiplarkin\">Philip Larkin, DH Lawrence, Thomas Hardy</a> and the culture of the so-called leave regions of England. Well before the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community\">European Economic Community</a> came into existence in 1957, Larkin was espousing the virtues of \u201cleaving\u201d and of separateness. His extraordinary and strikingly small body of verse must now be seen as a significant, undeniable and vivid component in the cultural history of the leave camp.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/07/north-poor-brexit-myths\">Think the north and the poor caused Brexit? Think again | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It seems like Larkin had long been preparing his English readership for Brexit. He found his characteristic voice \u2013 urbane, colloquial, morose, lyrical, dismissive of lyricism, at once essentially rooted and maladjusted \u2013 by his second book, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Less_Deceived\">The Less Deceived</a>. What was evident too by then was how much the poetry owed to his particular vision of an England that was non-metropolitan but not necessarily \u201cnatural\u201d (unlike the wild terrain his contemporary Ted Hughes was invested in); an England that was suburban and dull, the remnants of which, two months ago, voted largely to exit Europe.</p> <p>Larkin was not known as a propagator of happiness. Nor did he seem to believe that the English were equipped to be happy. When asked by an interviewer for the Observer whether he thought \u201cpeople go around feeling they haven\u2019t got out of life what life has to offer\u2019, he replied, \u2018I should think quite a lot of people do\u2019, adding, of his own predilections, \u201cdeprivation is for me what daffodils were to Wordsworth\u201d. At the beginning of the interview, he\u2019d clarified: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to write about being happy. Very easy to write about being miserable.\u201d</p> <p>In lieu of happiness, he desired a sense of being settled immovably in the familiar, which for him meant being situated \u201con the way to nowhere\u201d \u2013 the very zone from which many of the leavers have now spoken. This, for him, was Hull (where, as it happens, <a href=\"http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/hull-vote-to-leave-eu-is-cry-of-rage/story-29439178-detail/story.html\">more than 75,000</a> people voted to leave: nearly twice the number of those who wanted to remain), through which Larkin expressed his acute need to keep the world at bay: \u201cI like it because it\u2019s so far away from everywhere else.\u201d \u201cWould you like to visit, say, China?\u201d an interviewer from the Paris Review this time asked him. Larkin said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind seeing China if I could come back the same day. I hate being abroad.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/may/31/eu-referendum-brexit-for-non-brits-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4jqfb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2519111\"            data-video-name=\"EU referendum: Brexit for non-Brits \u2013 video explainer\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-574c6127e4b062390d4eec1b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/30/160530Brexit4nonbrits2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/30/160530Brexit4nonbrits2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/30/160530Brexit4nonbrits2_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/30/160530Brexit4nonbrits2_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/30/160530Brexit4nonbrits2_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/may/31/eu-referendum-brexit-for-non-brits-video-explainer\">EU referendum: Brexit for non-Brits</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Larkin may have thrilled to life\u2019s deprivations, but it was the England that came up between the fall of empire and the advent of Margaret Thatcher (whom he admired) and the discovery of North Sea oil that quickened him strangely. No one else could have been nostalgic for the dullness of housing estates in quite the same way as he was.</p> <p>For him, the peripheral constituencies far from London were a perpetual discovery. In an early poem, Coming, he notes how \u201cA thrush sings, / Laurel-surrounded / In the deep bare garden, / Its fresh-peeled voice / Astonishing the brickwork\u201d. The thrush and the \u201cdeep bare garden\u201d come to Larkin from his mentor Thomas Hardy, but the contemporaneity of \u201castonishing the brickwork\u201d is Larkin\u2019s, and embodies an England at once secret and in danger of vanishing the moment it\u2019s appeared.</p> <p>This is the Britain of manufacturing, whose days were numbered, and which, in <a href=\"http://www.allinfo.org.uk/levelup/dockery.htm\">Dockery and Son</a>, the narrator glimpses from a train window after returning from a visit to his old college: \u201cI fell asleep, waking at the fumes / And furnace-glares of Sheffield\u201d. At the college, \u201cthe Dean\u201d has reminded him that his classmate Dockery is dead, and revealed that he had a son who\u2019s now at the same college. Like Larkin, the narrator is single, and reflects, in the train, that \u201cTo have no son, no wife, / No house or land still seemed quite natural\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/07/jeremy-corbyn-rules-out-second-referendum-brexit\">Jeremy Corbyn rules out second referendum on Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A key theme is being broached here, related to Larkin\u2019s own stubborn bachelorhood: that to be English is not to be happy, necessarily \u2013 the opposite might be true \u2013 but it is at least to be alone and undisturbed. Indeed, this could well be the \u201cnatural\u201d condition of being English. Although Larkin wrote tenderly of English wedding rituals (\u201c<a href=\"http://we-english.co.uk/blog/2009/05/31/philip-larkin-the-whitsun-weddings/\">A dozen marriages got under way</a>\u201d), marriage and its outcome \u2013 children \u2013 perplex the narrator: \u201chow / Convinced he [Dockery] was he should be added to!/ Why did he think adding meant increase?/ To me it was dilution\u201d.</p> <p>This is fundamental both to the romance of Brexit and to the hysteria over immigration: the belief that separateness is England\u2019s, and thus Britain\u2019s, destiny, and that \u201cadding\u201d entails dilution of a culture rather than a form of increase. Multiculturalism itself is a complex marriage of societies with long-term consequences, and it\u2019s a kind of marriage that the Larkinesque bachelor would always have been resistant to.</p> <p>Post-referendum wisdom has reiterated that the leave campaign was unexpectedly successful because of all the people who live in towns \u201con the way to nowhere\u201d: their vote was a rebuttal of the London elite. But is it true that this elite comprises the only British people (besides the Scots) who feel European, that the underprivileged or marginal are necessarily inward-looking and provincial and seized by a Larkinesque disdain of \u201cabroad\u201d?</p> <p>That would be to underestimate the sense of entitlement in upper middle-class nostalgia for a particular England and a particular Europe, and to ignore the robust engagement with European \u2013 and world \u2013 culture in the history of the English working class. It would be to forget Lawrence, with his transformative vision of the Etruscan tombs in Italy and the rural marketplace in Mexico. Lawrence was a man whose radical cosmopolitanism could never have been formed in Eton and Oxford but only in Nottingham (a city which voted for Brexit by only a slender margin).</p> <p>It\u2019s also to forget the Beatles, who emerged from Liverpool but served their apprenticeship in Hamburg. John Lennon, born to working-class parents who had separated, was a brilliant curator of local English culture in songs like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LCclVtFR6o\">Being For the Benefit of Mr Kite</a>, in a way that makes him a precursor to present-day curators of peripheral English communities like the artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jeremy-deller\">Jeremy Deller</a>. But Lennon\u2019s ironical perspective on Englishness in such songs came surely not from closing ranks but from his constant access and openness to other cultures. It\u2019s an openness that prompted him to instruct George Martin to play a faux-Bach piano interlude in In My Life, and led to his important intellectual partnership with Yoko Ono</p> <p>Then there\u2019s David Hockney, born in Bradford to, in his own words, a \u201cradical working-class family\u201d, and plunged in childhood into the European masters.</p> <p>Modern Britain\u2019s cultural relationship with Europe would be attenuated without the working-class suburbs of industrial towns. If it has forgotten this fact in the last 30 years and handed proprietorship of that relationship to a tiny set in London, it must ask itself why.</p>",

Now they are facing the prospect of being even more alone. The French police have issued eviction notices to all the establishments in the camp that serve food. This is on the pretext of health and safety. All the shops and cafes in the camp play a useful role in taking some of the pressure off the charities and volunteer groups who are tasked with feeding the camp\u2019s residents. They&#xa0;are a symbol of the resourcefulness of some of the people in the camps, as they are thriving businesses.</p> <p>The Jungle Book Kids\u2019 Cafe is different. It is an essential safe space for the children of the camp. Every day it feeds hundreds of children who are alone in the camp for nothing. It provides somewhere safe for the children to be children with games and books. It helps children seek asylum. Most importantly, it keeps the children safe. Many, many have gone missing from the camp. There is a great deal of evidence that the rape and sexual exploitation of children in the camp has gone uninvestigated by the police. The cafe protects them.</p> <p>We are very frightened that the eviction of the Jungle Book Kids\u2019 Cafe will be a catastrophe for these children, some of them are as young as eight. They have already experienced more than any child should.

  "<p>Former CIA agent Evan McMullin \u2013 who launched an improbable independent bid for president on Monday in the hope of providing a conservative alternative to Donald Trump \u2013 faces significant hurdles in becoming a credible threat to the Republican nominee.</p> <p>A relative unknown even in Washington, McMullin filed the paperwork on Monday for a third-party run against Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But he now has to navigate intricate rules to secure a place on individual state presidential ballots.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republican-evan-mcmullin-presidential-run-trump\">Republican Evan McMullin to launch presidential run against Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And therein lies McMullin\u2019s key problem: he has already missed the deadline to appear on the ballot in half of America\u2019s 50 states, and he is unlikely to meet a deadline of less than 48 hours, on 10 August, to get on the ballot in seven more.</p> <p>In order to secure a place on the ballot where the deadline has passed, McMullin would have to file and win lawsuits in states he chooses to pursue. And even in states where time for ballot access remains, McMullin would have to secure the requisite number of signatures, which varies by state and as a matter of process requires both money and organization on the ground.</p> <p>Those helping McMullin with his long-shot candidacy insist they have donors on their side, citing the trend of high-dollar fundraisers sitting on the sidelines rather than backing Trump. </p> <p>But many influential Republicans also believe the Never Trump movement missed its opportunity to put forward a meaningful challenge to the former reality TV star ahead of the Republican national convention in Cleveland last month, where Trump formally accepted the party\u2019s nomination for president.<br><br>That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t a strategy behind the last-ditch effort to introduce McMullin to a dissatisfied electorate. The former House Republican staffer is a Mormon and native of Utah, a state that has remained reliably in the GOP\u2019s column but could prove a toss-up this November.</p> <p>Mormons dominate Utah \u2013 where candidates can still put their names forward until 31 August \u2013 and handed Trump one of his worst losses in the Republican presidential primary in June. As a voting bloc, they have <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/13/opinion/campaign-stops/donald-trumps-mormon-problem.html?_r=0\">fiercely opposed</a> Trump as someone counter to their faith-based values and further been turned off by his disparaging comments toward 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, himself a Mormon and member of the Never Trump movement.</p> <p>Romney has yet to endorse a candidate in the race but said he would vote for neither Trump nor Clinton. Mike Lee, the senator from Utah and a prominent figure in the conservative movement, has also declined thus far to endorse Trump.</p> <p>Trump currently holds just a four-point lead over Clinton in Utah, based on an average of <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-utah-president-trump-vs-clinton\">publicly available polling</a>. The emergence of McMullin could certainly inflict more damage to Trump\u2019s prospects in the state, where there is time yet to get on the ballot and six electoral votes will be at stake.</p> <p>McMullin will, however, have to compete for the anti-Trump conservative vote with Libertarian Gary Johnson, who also ran in 2012 and this time will appear on the ballot in all 50 states. Polling shows at least a faction of voters taking a longer look at the former governor of New Mexico, who has also attracted support from at least one sitting Republican congressman, Scott Rigell of Virginia and Marvin Bush, the brother of former president George W Bush.</p> <p>It is unclear where exactly McMullin stands on policy issues, with little yet known about his background and platform.</p> <p>But if McMullin can secure a place on the ballot in even a handful of red states where Trump is struggling to keep his footing, he could have the kind of spoiler effect that helps to deny the Republican nominee the presidency.</p>",

Increasingly, national parliaments have a say: up to 40 national and regional assemblies, including Belgium\u2019s six parliaments, could vote on the EU-Canada trade deal.<br></p> <p>The EU has 34 trade agreements covering 60 countries according to the commission. This tally includes single-country deals, such as agreements with non-EU Norway and Switzerland, or further afield, South Africa and South Korea. Also included are provisional deals with Ukraine and Georgia, trade deals that have been approved by EU institutions but have yet to be voted on by national parliaments. Dutch voters recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/06/dutch-voters-reject-closer-eu-links-to-ukraine-in-referendum\">voted down an EU treaty with Ukraine</a>, although the trade parts of the deal have already entered into force.<br></p> <p>Beyond this, the EU has embarked on 19 trade negotiations covering 52 countries. By far the biggest and most controversial is the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Talks are expected to intensify in the autumn, as both sides make a final push before Barack Obama leaves office. Trade talks are also under way with Vietnam and Japan, while Brussels hopes to upgrade an existing agreement with Mexico.</p> <p>Further down the line, the EU hopes to start trade talks with seven countries, including Australia.</p>",
  "<p>On March 26 this year, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3539363/Scientist-EasyJet-hauled-London-bound-flight-terror-fears.html\">Hasan Aldewachi</a> was on his way back from a science conference in Vienna, and looking forward to seeing his family. As he took his seat on the flight to Gatwick, he sent his wife a text message to let her know the plane was delayed. A woman sitting across the aisle got up and left her seat. Moments later the police arrived.</p> <p>The Iraqi-born Sheffield Hallam student was asked to leave the plane and held for four hours. After his phone was confiscated, he was left at the airport with no onward ticket or refund. The reason? His message was in Arabic.</p> <p>Aldewachi\u2019s story is just one example of the dangers of what has become known as \u201cflying while Muslim\u201d; the tongue-in-cheek term for the discrimination many Muslim passengers feel they have faced at airports since 9/11. It can range from extra questions from airport staff, to formal searches by police, to secondary security screenings and visa problems when visiting America. Sometimes it feels like every Muslim has a tale to tell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bfba30c63f98e2556e9ea8e62c395de27cd20fd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfba30c63f98e2556e9ea8e62c395de27cd20fd7/0_34_1220_732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Faizah Shaheen \u2026 reading about Syria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Faizah Shaheen \u2026 reading about Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two weeks ago, a Muslim couple celebrating their wedding anniversary were <a href=\"http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2016/08/04/muslim-group-announce-profiling-complaint-against-delta/88063364/\">removed from a flight from France to the US</a>. A crew member allegedly complained that Nazia Ali, 34, who wears a headscarf, was using her phone, and her husband Faisal was sweating. The flight attendant allegedly also complained that the couple used the word \u201cAllah\u201d. The airline in question subsequently said it was \u201cdeeply committed to treating all of our customers with respect\u201d.</p> <p>Other examples this summer include NHS mental-health worker Faizah Shaheen who was on her way back from her honeymoon when she was detained and questioned by police under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act.

As Handeyside points out, Dearborne is \u201cthe centre of the highest concentration of people of Arab descent outside the Middle East\u201d. The use of algorithms to determine who required extra screening renders the system even more opaque.</p> <p>The attorney, who spent two years working for the CIA, says the huge numbers involved mean the watchlists are not making us safer. \u201cIt increases the size of the haystack \u2013 if there is a needle in there it is so much harder to find \u2026 it immeasurably increases the white noise.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/23/no-fly-list-operates-in-secret-power-to-exclude\">The 'No Fly List' operates in secret, and its power to exclude is vast | Jeffrey Kahn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For cases of mistaken identity, there is a redress system.

Having travelling to and from the States several times in 2015, he was stopped by US Embassy officials at the airport in December and abruptly told his business visa had been revoked.</p> <p>Masroor, 44, who says he has received death threats for speaking out against terrorism in the past, explains he was eventually told the problem was someone on his Facebook page, \u201cbut I have 30,000 followers so I don\u2019t know who that is\u201d. And despite a letter from the State Department saying the revocation was an error, he says visits to the US embassy have not rectified the situation.</p> <p>One politician trying to discover the scale of the problem is the MP Stella Creasy. She has been asking questions about US Homeland Security issues after a family of 11 from her Walthamstow constituency were stopped at the airport <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/22/us-stops-british-muslim-family-flight-disneyland-david-cameron\">as they made their way to Disneyland</a>.

A year earlier, the Scottish MSP Humza Yousaf revealed he had been been stopped under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. It wasn\u2019t the first time he was stopped.</p> <p>Under the original legislation of this stop-and-search law act, anyone entering or leaving the UK could be held for up to nine hours with no grounds for suspicion needed. At its peak in 2009/10, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/19/david-miranda-ruling-throws-new-light-on-schedule-7-powers\">85,000 travellers a year</a> were stopped and ethnic minorities were 42 times more likely to be stopped than white passengers.</p> <p>Yousaf said his frequent stops illustrated that they were based on skin colour, not intelligence information.</p> <p>In 2014, after strong criticism, there was a change in the law referring to schedule 7 stops. The presence of a solicitor was required and the maximum detention time was reduced to six hours. It led to a dramatic drop in those stopped. The latest available data shows a considerably lower number \u2013 in 2015, a fall of 21% on the previous year. David Anderson, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, says this, in part, is down to an increased focus on data and behavioural analysis and a \u201creduced reliance on intuitive stops\u201d. Anderson does not believe the statistics show schedule 7 powers are being used in a racially discriminatory manner, although he acknowledges the stops cause \u201cconsiderable irritation for travellers of all ethnicities\u201d while \u201carrest rates remain very low indeed by the standards of stop and search\u201d. Five supreme court judges reviewed his analysis and while four agreed, one believed \u201cschedule 7 not only permits direct discrimination; it is entirely at odds with the notion of an enlightened pluralistic society\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e13cb2528bdd0d22186ec93bd74ccfe395eb0d85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e13cb2528bdd0d22186ec93bd74ccfe395eb0d85/320_328_878_878/500.jpg\" alt=\"Text with care\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Text with care.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Son of Alan/Folio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/circular-0012016-schedule-7-to-the-terrorism-act-2000/circular-0012016-schedule-7-to-the-terrorism-act-2000\">government published new guidance</a> pointing out that the decision to stop someone should not be arbitrary, and ethnicity and religion should only be considered significant in association with \u201cfactors which show a connection with the threat from terrorism\u201d.

Asians are almost 80 times as likely as a white person to be detained at an airport or port.\u201d Along with anecdotal evidence, this, they say, shows a \u201csignificant level of profiling that demands urgent action to ensure that British citizens and non-UK nationals visiting Britain are treated equally.\u201d</p> <p>Stefano Bonino, <a href=\"https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/b/stefano-bonino\">a criminologist at Northumbria University</a> recently, interviewed 39 Scottish Muslims.

The <a href=\"http://europe.newsweek.com/maximum-screen-time-443898?rm=eu\">classic case was the Anne Marie Murphy case in 1986</a>, who was stopped from boarding a flight to Tel Aviv \u2013 of 1986. She was white, female and pregnant \u2013 not a stereotypical image of a terrorist.\u201d Murphy was found to be unwittingly carrying explosives in her luggage \u2013 placed there by her Jordanian fianc\u00e9, Nezar Hindawi, who was jailed for 45 years.</p> <p>Baum suggests that the widespread belief that Muslims will be targeted could in turn change their behaviour. \u201cThere is a lot of paranoia and sometimes people can be affected by that \u2013 they act suspiciously because they think they will be picked on.\u201d</p> <p>While the fear of terrorism at airports means that many people are willing to put up with more intrusive security procedures, the discriminatory experiences at airports that many Muslims recount risks creating divisions and resentment.</p> <p>For Bonino the consequences are clear. \u201cGrievance based jihadi propaganda can use things like this.

  "<h2>Graffiti, translated</h2> <p>Urban graffiti has long been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jan/07/urban-graffiti-force-good-evil\">a divisive issue</a> \u2013 with many classing it as illegal defacement of private property or an eyesore, while others champion its artistic and self-expressive value. Though one arm of the practice has become classified as \u201cstreet art\u201d \u2013 a more culturally celebrated format which has even become commericalised \u2013 another form of graffiti based around quickly-sprayed tags and slogans remains a largely unpopular addition to urban space. More than that, these tags are illegible to most. </p> <p>The work of street artist Mathieu Tremblin has been called a \u201cgraffiti translation service\u201d. Strasbourg-based Tremblin finds graffiti tags on buildings, garage doors, and highway underpasses in French cities, catalogues them, erases them and re-paints them in clear, digital-style typeface: Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman or Georgia. The project, called Tag Clouds, is about the idea of \u201crevealing that tagging, if you follow it and read it, is a way to go through the city in a different manner,\u201d says the artist <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/07/graffiti-tags-look-like-helvetica-times-new-roman/\">in an interview with Wired</a>.</p> <p>But Tremblin\u2019s interventions are a celebration rather than critique of graffiti tags. \u201cSpontaneous graffiti writing became the ugly duck of art in the city. With Tag Clouds the idea is to make a tribute to spontaneous writing, in order that inhabitants accepts its visual presence by reading it,\u201d he adds via email. The artist also believes that graffiti tagging is a response to an increasingly \u201cconsumerist space\u201d in our cities, full of advertising on every surface, which he says \u201creduces the individual expression of citizens to a matter of choices between brands\u201d.</p> <p>By using digital typeface, Tremblin not only makes the words legible \u2013 even if they don\u2019t seem to make a lot of sense \u2013 but also deliberately creates resemblances to \u201cword clouds\u201d found online, musing on the difference between digital and physical tags. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f63c01dc9949d17d8744ae9e421d272cf19c502b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f63c01dc9949d17d8744ae9e421d272cf19c502b/0_40_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rue Jules Ferry in Arles before Tremblin\u2019s intervention.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rue Jules Ferry in Arles before Tremblin\u2019s intervention.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mathieu Tremblin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Olympic cities</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.curbed.com/2016/8/3/12342520/olympic-city-host-rio-athens-london  http://www.curbed.com/2016/8/3/12342520/olympic-city-host-rio-athens-london  http://www.curbed.com/2016/8/3/12342520/olympic-city-host-rio-athens-london  \">Writing in Curbed</a>, Nate Berg takes an in-depth look at the impact and legacy of the Olympic Games on host cities, from Rome \u2013 home to the 1960 Games and regarded as the first host city to use the event as an impetus for urban change \u2013 to Montreal, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/06/40-year-hangover-1976-olympic-games-broke-montreal-canada\">1976 Olympics left the city in debt and damaged its reputation</a>.

Buildings were getting higher and higher; streets became more packed. In 1913, the borough president of Manhattan <a href=\"http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1953/07/30/83818379.html?pageNumber=23\">George McAneny</a> said: \u201cThe time has come when effort should be made to regulate the height, size and arrangement of buildings.\u201d His measure established what amounted to a zoning committee. </p> <p>He believed regulations were needed \u201cto arrest the seriously increasing evil of the shutting off of light and air from other buildings and from the public streets, to prevent unwholesome and dangerous congestion both in living conditions and in street and transit traffic, and to reduce the hazards of fire and peril to life.\u201d On 25 July 1916 <a href=\"http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/07/26/100217355.html?pageNumber=1\">New York City enacted its first Zoning Resolution</a>, which has reduced the density of the city. In 1910, Manhattan\u2019s population density was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2997625-New-York-City-Population-Density-1910-2010.html\">164 people per acre</a> \u2013 in 2010, it was 109, despite the overall population of the city growing. What would the city now look like without it?</p> <h2>Tokyo-lized cities</h2> <p>When you think of a Tokyo street scene, the vision tends to be a busy one of endless colourful and neon signs. But imagining how other urban streets around the world would look if they were given the Tokyo treatment \u2013 or \u201cTokyo-lized\u201d \u2013 is the focus of a project by <a href=\"http://www.designboom.com/tag/futurescape/\">daigo ishii + future-scape architects</a> for the Venice Architecture Biennale. <a href=\"http://www.designboom.com/art/daigo-ishii-future-scape-architects-worldwide-tokyo-lization-project-venice-architecture-biennale-07-26-2016/\">Design Boom has some fun gifs</a> showing the visual transformation of Paris, La Paz, Copenhagen, New York and Venice.</p> <h2>Changing LA<br></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIHfmisMLOY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WIHfmisMLOY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>How have the streets of Los Angeles changed over 70 years?

He is expected to file paperwork on Monday afternoon, but would nonetheless face hurdles getting on the ballot in states where the deadline has already passed.</p> <p>Rory Cooper, a Republican strategist who counts himself among the Never Trump ranks, said it was important to have a candidate \u201cdraw a distinction between Trump and conservatism\u201d regardless of the odds. </p> <p>\u201cThere are clear and obvious hurdles to an independent run at this point, especially not being a household name, but I assume they are well aware of them and I\u2019ll withhold judgment and keep an open mind,\u201d said Cooper, who served as an aide to former House majority leader Eric Cantor. </p> <p>\u201cThe next generation of leaders need to step up and start making a difference or conservatism will be electorally challenged for years to come.\u201d</p> <p>But as Cooper indicates, McMullin holds little name recognition even among Republicans in Washington. He has been a vocal critic of Trump\u2019s on Twitter, but hardly a recognizable member of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/18/donald-trump-republican-national-convention-party-unity\">\u201cNever Trump\u201d movement</a>.</p> <p>McMullin is 40 years old, unmarried and has never previously run for office. He holds an MBA from Wharton business school, which Trump attended as an undergraduate.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>McMullin\u2019s campaign website does not yet have a page outlining his policy platforms or one detailing his personal biography. The site, which was originally created in October 2011 and <a href=\"http://www.whois.com/whois/evanmcmullin.com\">appears</a> to have been updated on Sunday, links to his social media pages, including his <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mcmullinforpresident\">Facebook</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/evan.mcmullin/\">Instagram</a> profiles, which do not have any posts. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>McMullin has repeatedly denounced Trump as an \u201cauthoritarian\u201d and used the #NeverTrump hashtag on Twitter, where he boasted 135 followers before his presidential announcement propelled him to more than 7,000 by mid-morning on Monday.</p> <p>Prior to his announcement, McMullin\u2019s most high-profile public engagement appears to be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9pNKTNlp6w&amp;list=PLsRNoUx8w3rMag4h7hVZm7vLR4t9xssjo\">a TedX talk on genocide</a> that he delivered at the London Business School in April. In the talk, McMullin recalled time spent studying in Damascus as a student and noted that he spoke Arabic, though on his LinkedIn profile he lists only English and Portuguese under languages. </p> <p>McMullin served for more than 10 years as an undercover operations officer with the CIA\u2019s National Clandestine Service, including posts in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, according to a short biography published on the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://piw.sas.upenn.edu/semester-program/blogs/alumni-spotlight-evan-mcmullin-past-present-and-future-republican-party\">University of Pennsylvania\u2019s website</a>, his alma mater.</p> <p>Asked to confirm McMullin\u2019s employment and to detail his career at Langley, CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu declined to comment.</p> <p>He returned to the University of Pennsylvania this spring to deliver a lecture on the future of the Republican party. <br></p> <p>\u201cI believe that our country is at an important point in our history and the decisions we make over the next year will drive, of course, the direction that our country takes,\u201d he said in the lecture. </p> <p>Though McMullin has never held public office, his mother, Lanie McMullin, is involved in local government, serving as the <a href=\"https://everettwa.gov/724/Economic-Development\">economic development executive director </a>for the city of Everett, Washington, about 30 miles north of Seattle. </p> <p>McMullin previously advised the House committee on foreign affairs on national security issues and was the chief policy director with the House Republican Conference.</p> <p>Nate Hodson, a spokesman for the House GOP, said McMullin no longer worked as its policy director.</p> <p>\u201cThe House Republican Conference has zero knowledge of his intentions,\u201d Hodson said in a statement.</p> <p>Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Washington congresswoman and the House Republican conference chair, is supporting Trump.</p> <p>McMullin\u2019s Twitter profile reveals a sharp interest in the Syrian civil war and a disappointment with the US\u2019s response to the conflict, still raging in its fifth year. By some estimations, the war has caused between 280,000 and 470,000 deaths, created millions of refugees and contributed to the emergence of the Islamic State group.<br></p> <p>In 2001, McMullin worked as a volunteer for the United Nations <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/166589?trk=prof-exp-company-name\">high commissioner for refugees</a> in the office of<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/title/volunteer-refugee-resettlement-officer?trk=mprofile_title\"> refugee resettlement</a>, where he vetted and processed UN-recognized refugees from the Middle East and Africa for resettlement to third countries, according to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/devanmcmullin?authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=ITzi&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CclickedEntityId%3A61765834%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1470671301552%2Ctas%3AEvan%20McMullin\">his LinkedIn profile</a>. </p> <p>\u201cPeople who talk tough about Isis, but then spend all of their time attacking refugees, know little about keeping America safe,\u201d McMullin wrote in January during a Republican debate.<br></p> <p><em>Spencer Ackerman contributed to this report.</em></p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 8 August 2016.

  "<p>He had already made his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/seattle-sounders\">Seattle Sounders</a> bow by the time he took to the field to face Orlando City, but at the Citrus Bowl on Sunday evening Nicol\u00e1s Lodeiro truly arrived. There were glimpses of the Uruguayan\u2019s capabilities against the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/losangelesgalaxy\">LA Galaxy</a> the week before, yet in central Florida he produced a showcase of his full range. This performance underlined how one exceptional player can elevate an entire team, and there is no doubt that Lodeiro is exceptional.</p> <p>Clint Dempsey claimed the match ball, and the headlines, with a hat-trick in the 3-1 victory, but that was largely down to Lodeiro. Well, technically two of his three goals were down to Jordan Morris, but the performance of the sometimes maligned rookie was certainly down to Lodeiro. The Uruguayan\u2019s position on the right side of Seattle\u2019s front four freed up space for Morris, which he used to record four \u201cbig chances\u201d, as Opta calls them, a record high for any MLS player this season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/05/mls-weekend-preview-alejandro-bedoya-philadelphia-union\">MLS weekend preview: Alejandro Bedoya could be signing of the season</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/05/mls-weekend-preview-alejandro-bedoya-philadelphia-union\">Just a few days ago I wrote</a> about how the signing of Lodeiro could see Dempsey strike up the kind of attacking partnership he enjoyed over the past couple of seasons with Obafemi Martins, but in truth the arrival of the former Ajax playmaker could have the biggest impact on Morris. Lodeiro\u2019s creativity around the edge of the box has given the Sounders a new dimension, but his greatest quality is that he makes others around him better, none more so than Morris.</p> <p>Statistically, it\u2019s difficult to quantify just how important Lodeiro has already become to this Seattle team. While he notched not one assist or goal on Sunday, he made two secondary assists. Those contributions often go uncharted in soccer, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are any less significant. In some cases they are the most important transition in an attacking move, and Lodeiro is excellent at producing them. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WillParchman/status/762459571294130176\">As Will Parchman said on Twitter</a>, he is the footballing equivalent of Jon Favreau\u2019s character in Swingers \u2013 the guy behind the guy.</p> <p>Seattle needed a result like the one they got against Orlando City. Their season has faltered before it ever really got going, winning just two of their last 12 league outings before Sunday\u2019s game at the Citrus Bowl. Sigi Schmid paid for such dismal form with his job and now Lodeiro is doing his best to ensure the Sounders don\u2019t concede their entire season. His signing could prove to be a watershed moment for the club, not just in the context of the 2016 seasons but in seasons to come too. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong>Marsch sees red as Red Bulls drop points on the road</strong></h2> <p>Perhaps Jesse Marsch has a point after all.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/newyorkredbulls\">Red Bulls</a> boss has had his problems with MLS officials this season. In his most recent stump against PRO, Marsch paid the price for suggesting officials make calls to protect ageing designated players. That pre-NYC FC rant worked in his favor en route to an impressive victory. </p> <p>But the animated Marsch felt the wrath of the officials for his on-field critiques on Sunday night.<br></p> <p>Marsch was ejected late in the Red Bulls-Galaxy 2-2 draw after referees failed to reward his team on not one, but two clearcut penalty chances. The uncalled penalty shouts, along with a string of physical tackles and outright injuries, drove the Red Bulls boss to his limit, resulting in his ejection just shy of extra time. </p> <p>As he received his marching papers, an animated Marsch hugged fourth official Kevin Stott on his way to the locker room, clearly fuming from another frustrating road encounter.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear to see how the Red Bulls head coach reached that boiling point. He was forced to make three substitutions within the first 47 minutes \u2013 all due to injuries. First, it was Damien Perrinelle collapsing on a foul from Jeff Lawrentowicz. It was arguably a yellow card-worthy tackle but the Galaxy midfielder managed to leave that scrap with a simple foul \u2013 his only call of the game. Connor Lade was next, suffering a knee injury that required an ice wrap \u2013 and a towel to bite on for the pain. Rounding out the wounded, Bradley Wright-Phillips requested a sub just two minutes into the second.</p> <p>That string of bad news did lead to some positivity. The oft-overlooked Gonzalo Ver\u00f3n got extended minutes at the pinnacle of the attack and made the best of his opportunity. A rainbow chip over Brian Rowe put his side up 1-0. Six minutes later, Sean Davis, in for the injured Dax McCarty, showed his class with his first-ever MLS goal, doubling New York\u2019s lead.</p> <p>But as has been the case for the Red Bulls this season, they were unable to close out the road result \u2013 only this time, it wasn\u2019t entirely their fault. </p> <p>Mike Magee cut New York\u2019s lead in half with 10 minutes to go. Then, opportunity arose for New York. Brian Rowe fouled Alex Muyl in the box, challenging on a late ball. Despite the foul, no PK was given. Then, it was Ver\u00f3n getting tripped up by Rowe mere feet from head official Hilario Grejada. Again, no call. No PK.<br></p> <p>But the ensuing goal from Ashley Cole is what set Marsch off. Had either of the previous calls gone New York\u2019s way, the Red Bulls would have had a better chance to leave LA with a rare three points. Instead, Marsch and his men head back to Harrison feeling like they left two behind. <strong>DM</strong><br></p> <h2>Fire in a hole as Open Cup beckons</h2> <p>While Saturday night marked another milestone for Nick Rimando\u2019s career, let\u2019s not forget: every away match without a win only further carves the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chicago-fire\">Chicago Fire</a>\u2019s name into Major League Soccer\u2019s history books.</p> <p>The Fire\u2019s 3-1 loss against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/realsaltlake\">Real Salt Lake</a> at Rio Tinto not only furthered their unenviable position as the worst team in Major League Soccer, but it also extended their winless run on the road to 36 matches \u2013 a record that dates all the way back to 12 July 2014 (a 1-0 win over the Revolution).</p> <p>That is an unbelievable number when you think about it. The streak spans three MLS seasons, three calendar years, three Chicago Fire coaches and a total of 747 days. In fact, the last time the Fire tasted victory on the road, Ellen Degeneres introduced Oscar-watching baby boomers to the magic of a selfie and Justin Bieber earned his troubled child-star badge with an arrest for DUI \u2013 with a tabloid tickling mugshot to boot!</p> <p>Never mind that the Fire are coming off of an impressive 2-2 draw at home against the highly touted New York Red Bulls or the fact that they have actually been competitive in most matches this year. Saturday\u2019s match was a chance to end that streak for good. </p> <p>Instead, the Fire seemed content to go through the motions, happy to wrap up another pointless road trip in order to prepare for their vital US Open Cup semi-final match against the Revolution on Tuesday. </p> <p>And can you blame them? It isn\u2019t like the MLS regular season will produce any kind of glory for this beaten-down bunch. As odd as it seems, this Fire team was looking past RSL \u2013 and all the proof you need came in the first goal. A flatfooted Fire backline watched on as a slow-rolling 25-yard shot from Olmes Garc\u00eda skipped past the defense, beating a slow-to-react Matt Lampson to open the scoring. </p> <p>A boneheaded PK made it 2-0 within the first 30 minutes. By the start of the second half, David Accam and Michael de Leeuw were pulled out of the match, with Tuesday on the mind. Arturo \u00c1lvarez\u2019s 58th-minute goal breathed life into the bunch, but it was a fleeting moment. Nick Rimando made sure of that. </p> <p>Paunovic\u2019s initial insertion of Accam and De Leeuw to the starting XI signaled a competitive tone to this encounter, but the team\u2019s response told another story. By the end of the 90, Chicago added another blemish to their already unsightly record.</p> <p>But this time, there was no question about their motivation. As if their 4-11-6 record wasn\u2019t indicator enough, this Saturday\u2019s performance proves where Chicago\u2019s priorities lie: it\u2019s US Open Cup or bust. <strong>DM</strong></p> <h2><strong>Nick Rimando is the unheralded great of his goalkeeping generation</strong></h2> <p>There are theories that attempt to explain why the USA is so prolific at producing exceptional goalkeepers, but regardless of how they are made there is no doubting the quality of the country\u2019s shot-stoppers over the past decade or so. There was Kasey Keller, then Tim Howard, then Brad Guzan, all with a background in Major League Soccer. Nick Rimando, however, is the unheralded great of the contingent.</p> <p>Of course, North American soccer fans are familiar with the brilliance of the Real Salt Lake keeper, but having played his entire career in the States the 37-year-old seems doomed to never receive the credit he truly deserves. Maybe that will change now he\u2019s a record-breaker, with Rimando picking up his 181st MLS win against the Chicago Fire on Saturday. No player in league history has won that many games.</p> <p>The RSL number one was already number one in terms of MLS shutouts (126) and has now made more starting appearances and played more minutes than anyone else in the North American top flight, with Rimando surely now running out of space on his walls for another framed record. He is a bona fide legend of the league.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t achieve that record by doing one thing,\u201d gushed Jeff Cassar after the win over Chicago. \u201cIt\u2019s many things. It\u2019s being a leader. It\u2019s being unbelievable at your craft. He\u2019s come up big so many times for this club in moments when it\u2019s shootouts and big saves. He\u2019s a leader in the way he approaches the game and he\u2019s just gotten better and better.\u201d</p> <p>Rather bizarrely, Rimando has never picked up the league\u2019s Goalkeeper of the Year honour, but he is MLS\u2019s goalkeeper of the decade following stints with the Miami Fusion, DC United and of course Real Salt Lake. At just 5ft 10in he is somewhat short for a goalkeeper, particularly in the modern age, but he more than makes up for that in terms of reflexes, presence and experience. He is an anomaly in many ways, but a gloriously consistent one.</p> <p>With just three more outings Rimando will tie the record for the most MLS appearances in total, with the 37-year-old needing 45 more saves to claim the record in that column as well. Some claim MLS lacks enough strong figureheads and icons to build narrative from, but they don\u2019t come much more iconic than Rimando. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong>Kei Kamara and New England Revolution a less than perfect match</strong></h2> <p>It should have been the perfect signing for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/newenglandrevolution\">New England Revolution</a>. With Jay Heaps in need of a frontman to lead his attacking line, he couldn\u2019t have found a better candidate than Kei Kamara to perform that role. What\u2019s more, they signed him for nothing more than targeted and allocation money of just over $300,000, opportunistically capitalising on a turbulent situation at the Columbus Crew. The theory behind the move hasn\u2019t quite matched up with the reality, though.</p> <p>Indeed, Kamara hasn\u2019t had the impact that was predicted of him for the Revolution. Saturday\u2019s 4-1 defeat to Toronto FC was something of a nadir in New England\u2019s season, and while the loss certainly couldn\u2019t be attributed to the striker there was little to suggest Kamara is any closer to being the player his team so badly needs him to be.</p> <p>Kamara\u2019s scoring record since joining from Columbus isn\u2019t the worst, although four goals from 12 games isn\u2019t the mark of the league\u2019s most dangerous frontman. The issue with the Sierra Leone international at the Revs is more of a stylistic one. He has become something of a misfit at his new club, with New England reluctant to play quickly through the lines of transition as the Crew did so effectively last season.</p> <p>While Columbus would cross it into the box early, allowing Kamara to attack the ball without breaking his stride on the run, the Revolution are more likely to delay their delivery, with the Sierra Leone striker not as effective from a standing start. Heaps\u2019s side simply aren\u2019t playing to Kamara\u2019s strengths and that is detrimental to everyone involved. The 31-year-old is among the league\u2019s best at attacking crosses, getting in between the opposition defense, causing general mayhem in the attacking third. The Revs, however, aren\u2019t allowing him to do that.</p> <p>New England, in fact, become a more predictable, one-dimensional outfit since the signing of the forward from Columbus three months ago. Against TFC at BMO Field that was exposed, with Sebastian Giovinco netting his second hat-trick in his last four outings as the Revs fell way short of the required standard. The Italian edged out Kamara for last season\u2019s MVP award, but the two players have enjoyed differing fortunes since. That contrast was clear for all to see on Saturday. <strong>GR</strong></p>",
  "<p>Strange as it may seem, given that Conservative governments look nailed on for many years, it wasn\u2019t long ago that a Labour politician from the left of the party\u2019s centre won a big election victory that many thought beyond him. He did it despite being not very well known, despite not starting out as the favourite to even be his party\u2019s candidate, and despite being subjected to one of the most sustained negative campaigning onslaughts this country has ever seen. Not only did he win, he won by a fat margin. Strangest of all, his triumph happened less than three months ago.</p> <p>As they immerse in their leadership bloodbath, even Labour party members could be forgiven for forgetting that it was only on 5 May that Sadiq Khan hammered his Tory opponent Zac Goldsmith to become mayor of London \u2013 and, in the process, the most powerful Labour politician in the land. It might cheer them up to start remembering. London has its own, distinctive political ecosystem, but Khan\u2019s capture of City Hall holds valuable lessons both for those who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/03/new-labour-brought-hope-jeremy-corbyn-has-brought-despair\" title=\"\">defiantly upbeat about their party\u2019s national fortunes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/15/labour-death-spite-bullying-working-class-base\" title=\"\">those who are in despair</a>, wherever in Britain they may live.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/16/sadiq-khan-shame-of-london-homeless\">London is the world\u2019s greatest city; we cannot sit back and do nothing about the rough sleeping crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Think back to how things were a year ago. David Cameron had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/david-cameron-conservative-government-election-victory\" title=\"\">won a shock majority</a> at the general election and Tory hopes were pretty high that Goldsmith, seen as a charismatic, liberal maverick with lots of green appeal, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/09/zac-goldsmith-run-london-mayor-constituents-back\" title=\"\">could succeed Boris Johnson</a> as the capital\u2019s political leader, even though London had bucked the national trend by strengthening Labour\u2019s position in the area in the 2015 general election. Come mid-September, they were more hopeful still. Labour\u2019s London selectorate had rejected Tessa Jowell, the former Olympics minister and loyal lieutenant of Tony Blair, in favour of the \u201csoft left\u201d Khan, whose profile was lower and whose chances against the Richmond dreamboat looked less optimistic.</p> <p>What happened next may distress some readers. Khan, having outflanked Jowell in part by courting the same people who made Corbyn party leader, then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/08/sadiq-khan-jeremy-corbyn-labour-election-strategy\" title=\"\">distanced himself from Corbyn</a> at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wile_E._Coyote_and_The_Road_Runner\" title=\"\">Road Runner</a> speed. Yes, he was one of those MPs who\u2019d \u201clent\u201d Corbyn his nomination to let him into the Labour leadership race in the first place. But Khan stressed that he hadn\u2019t voted for his new leader and went on to publicly rebuke him for failing to sing the national anthem. He also criticised the policies of the shadow chancellor John McDonnell and pledged to be \u201cthe most business-friendly mayor ever\u201d.</p> <p>Khan had his reasons. Goldsmith\u2019s campaign was soon relentlessly yoking Khan\u2019s name to Corbyn\u2019s, claiming the pair planned a madcap \u201cexperiment\u201d on a city Johnson had supposedly restored to greatness. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/07/zac-goldsmith-racist-campaign-london\" title=\"\">Then came the focus on Khan\u2019s religion</a>. A string of past \u201clinks\u201d \u2013 low journalese for guilt by association \u2013 with alleged Muslim extremists were successively reported in Tory-leaning papers, <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article1668187.ece\" title=\"\">led by the Sunday Times</a>.</p> <p>The stories were thin \u2013 one of the supposed \u201cextremists\u201d turned out to be a Tory supporter \u2013 and the insinuation that Khan would be a tame accomplice in some dastardly Corbynite plot was drivel. But amid concerns about Islamist terrorism, the Tories\u2019 stirring of doubts about Khan\u2019s trustworthiness, indeed his very identity \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/03/who-is-sadiq-khan-what-is-his-manifesto-and-should-i-vote-for-hi/\" title=\"\">Who is Sadiq Khan?</a>\u201d they nudged and winked \u2013 seemed rich in destructive potential. As winter turned to spring, poll after poll showed Khan well ahead. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/14/guardian-view-flawed-election-forecasts-polls-apart\" title=\"\">But could they be believed</a>?</p> <p>They could. Khan won 44% of first preference votes under the supplementary vote system, compared with Goldsmith\u2019s 35% \u2013 almost exactly the same proportions as Labour and Conservative parliamentary candidates had taken in London at the general election. Augmented by the lion\u2019s share of second preference votes, Khan\u2019s margin of victory was crushing.</p> <p>There is some evidence that Goldsmith\u2019s tactics worked, but insofar as they did, Khan\u2019s campaign seems to have cancelled out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/07/tories-scare-politics-zac-goldsmith-sadiq-khan\" title=\"\">their harmful effects</a>. Every time the \u201cscary Muslim\u201d card was played, Khan looked to turn the attack to his advantage: \u201cI will be the British Muslim who takes the fight to the extremists.\u201d</p> <p>If he wasn\u2019t to the taste of some white British Londoners and some non-Muslim Asian ones, the latter famously targeted with the absurd proposition by Goldsmith that Khan <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/16/zac-goldsmith-leaflet-british-indians-heirlooms\" title=\"\">yearned to tax their family jewellery</a>, at least as many other Londoners were mobilised in his favour. The influence of Corbyn appears to have been neutral too, in line with Labour\u2019s overall performance in London borough by-elections during the months after he became party leader.</p> <p>What lessons can Labour members and supporters learn from this thumping win that suddenly feels so long ago? One is that Khan fought cannily, if not ruthlessly, sizing up the battleground, colonising the capital\u2019s mainstream from the left, constructing pre-emptive defences against enemy attacks and playing to his strengths \u2013 the bus driver\u2019s son from a council estate, and so on \u2013 with steely self-discipline. He maintained Labour\u2019s London advantage and built on it in his own way. London is distinctive, but Khan\u2019s skills are transferable.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theredshed.org.uk/\">The Red Shed</a> is Wakefield\u2019s Labour club. Mark Thomas has been going there since he was a student at nearby Bretton Hall. It\u2019s an unassuming wooden building across the road from the imposing Tory club. The latter has long since closed down. This year the Red Shed celebrates its 50th anniversary and is thriving. Inside, there are banners and badges that recall the struggles it has supported, the victories and defeats it has seen. This show is Thomas\u2019s love letter to the Shed and to half a century of Labour activism, embracing the legacies of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/guardianwitness-blog/2015/mar/05/miners-strike-30-years-on-i-fought-not-just-for-my-pit-but-for-the-community\">miners\u2019 strike</a> and the dangers of mis-remembering \u2013 or not remembering at all.</p> <p> Asked by a journalist in 1989 about his politics, Thomas recalled walking alongside the miners in a Yorkshire village as the men marched back to their colliery after the strike ended in defeat. What he remembered distinctly was the children in a primary school looking through the Victorian railings of the playground as their fathers, brothers and uncles went by, and singing to them in the face of defeat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e4777bd8627b3f0d128ce84988335bf2b3350c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e4777bd8627b3f0d128ce84988335bf2b3350c2/0_354_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plenty to get your teeth into \u2026 The Red Shed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plenty to get your teeth into \u2026 The Red Shed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Did that moment really happen or did Thomas imagine it? To celebrate the Red Shed\u2019s anniversary, he sets out to find the answer in a quest that takes him through the villages and towns where the sites of former collieries have been replaced by McDonald\u2019s restaurants and shopping centres, and memory has been obliterated. Is the Shed merely wallowing in nostalgia, particularly at a time when the Labour party is in disarray and the Tories look set to be in power for years?

  "<p>Over the past half-decade, Afrobeat \u2013 the fusion of traditional African rhythms with American jazz and soul \u2013 has moved from a niche genre beloved of specialist fans to something with a foothold in the mainstream \u2013 so much so that Will Smith and Jay Z have seen a handsome return from investing in Fela<em>, </em>the musical retelling of the story of Afrobeat\u2019s founding father. It\u2019s a compelling tale: Fela Kuti was a remarkably talented musician who combined raucous sax licks with throaty denunciations of a corrupt system. His unexpected death from an Aids-related illness guaranteed him legendary status, and Fela\u2019s back catalogue has since been comprehensibly mined for what seems like a burgeoning fanbase in Europe and the US. </p> <p>But while a new audience thrills to a staccato funk that is more than 40 years old, Lagos has moved on.

Slick with Auto-Tuned vocals, big-budget videos and bling lifestyles, to a casual observer this new scene can feel as far from Fela\u2019s era of political confrontation as Kanye West is from Curtis Mayfield. Inevitably the reality is far more complex.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/aug/05/gateways-tony-allen-drumming-video-livestream-moses-boyd\">Watch Tony Allen pass on his drumming tips to new jazz star Moses Boyd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMost of the Afrobeats scene,\u201d says Fela\u2019s son, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/femi-kuti\">Femi Kuti</a>, \u201cgives credit to my father, but I think they find it difficult to give me praise. Which is OK.\u201d He chuckles. Femi has come to terms with not getting his dues, despite being the most overt link between Afrobeat and Afrobeats. In 2013, he made this connection explicit by collaborating with Wizkid, the biggest pop star in Nigeria, on the track <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAV4KlD86E8\">Jaiye Jaiye</a>. A huge hit, the song saw Femi\u2019s scorching sax augment Wizkid\u2019s buoyant lyricism, and showed that the old generation could communicate with the new. But, as Femi points out, while this may have been the first time his name was featured on a fresh, mainstream track, his influence on the new generation has been plain to see for some time. He plucks out an example: <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5oQVN-reAI\">Ice Prince\u2019s 2011 hit JuJu</a> included lyrical melodies from Femi\u2019s own emphatically traditional track <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZTEDXOSewI\">Inside Religion</a>. \u201cI got in an argument with someone on Twitter,\u201d Femi says, feigning exhaustion. \u201cHe said: \u2018Why are you taking something that belongs to Ice Prince?\u2019.

He is typical of the new school of Afrobeats stars: brash, hip-hop infatuated, and willing to push his sound in strange new directions.

In 2004, they returned to a Lagos that was primed for a new generation of stars. They were instantly successful, producing a string of hit albums that eventually saw the pair break out of Nigeria and on to an international stage \u2013 albeit separately. D\u2019Banj signed to Sony and released Oliver Twist, the first Afrobeats track to break the UK market in a meaningful way; Don Jazzy was called up to do production work on West\u2019s and Jay-Z\u2019s Watch the Throne album.

Fela\u2019s movement was what he felt; he decided to speak for the people. Sometimes we decide to do that, but not fully in your face. People want to dance, and while some people are trying to make you consciously aware of what is going on in the struggle, there should be other people who are trying to keep you happy while you are going through those struggles \u2013 that\u2019s where we come in. OK, we\u2019re struggling, we\u2019re all struggling together, but sometimes we need that peace of mind. When you feel sad, you listen to Don Jazzy, and you dance around.

  "<p>Would you work on a remote British farm, putting in long days picking fruit and digging up potatoes in the countryside?

Most of us would answer no to the above question without a second thought. In a recent report, the chairman of a large produce firm, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/03/brexit-could-herald-end-to-british-fruit-and-veg-sales-producers-warn\">said</a> that \u201cno British person wants a seasonal job working in the fields. They want permanent jobs or jobs that are not quite as taxing physically.\u201d</p> <p>So companies like this rely on up to 70,000 foreign workers to pick, sort and pack fruit and vegetables. They are more willing to get their hands dirty for low pay. The same is the case in many other British industries. Not many of us want to be employed cleaning up a slaughter house, for example, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/22/will-europeans-be-free-to-stay-in-the-uk-after-brexit\">eastern European workers</a> are vital.</p> <p>But this arrangement is now seriously at risk following the Brexit vote. <a href=\"http://britishgrowers.org/\">The British Growers Association</a> has warned that if these seasonal workers are not given special permits to enter the country, the whole industry will be in dire straits. Labour shortages would probably force producers to close or relocate overseas.</p> <p>This might seem like just another economic problem. But it holds implications for national security according to Erica Consterdine from the University of Sussex\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/migration/\">Centre for Migration Research</a>. For her, the failure to consider the importance of these foreign seasonal workers in a post-Brexit world means that \u201cit\u2019s looking pretty bad in terms of the security of the food supply chain. It would be disastrous.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, embracing the spirit of Brexit to the full would immediately hurt this and other industries. The issue is one facing a number of countries that rely on cheap labour. For example, if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/16/donald-trump-says-illegal-immigrants-have-to-go-in-nbc-interview\">Donald Trump got his way</a> and deported illegal immigrants from the US, the Californian economy would probably collapse overnight.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the pay was more reasonable in this lucrative industry, there would be no labour shortage, regardless of Brexit</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the question of cheap foreign labour raises a number of thorny issues. For example, one popular response is to point the finger at the unemployed. Why are we so reliant on foreigners when thousands of people are sitting around doing nothing? Put them to work in the fields, and if they don\u2019t want to get their hands dirty, tough!</p> <p>The argument is ridiculous not simply because it plumbs the worst depths of populist idiocy. It misses the point that many unemployed people are elderly or ill, rendering them useless for jobs that require hard labour. But even able-bodied people can\u2019t be forced to do work they don\u2019t want to do. That type of thing only happens in countries that have given up on basic human rights.</p> <p>It\u2019s here that we enter into tricky territory. We\u2019re against British people being forced to do low-paid work, but completely fine if a desperate Polish mother-of-three ends up doing it instead. Something of a double standard?</p> <p>Insipid nationalism is a great way to displace the problems of \u201cextreme capitalism\u201d on to a particular ethnicity or minority group. Wasn\u2019t this really what Brexit was about at the end of the day? So, instead of fixating on the worker as such (who they are, where they come from, whether they are taking employment from a British person), we ought to look at the work itself. Especially the pay and conditions. The real travesty in this story are the low wages that have become normal in a lucrative industry. If the pay was more reasonable, there would be no labour shortage, regardless of Brexit.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, if agriculture is really a question of national security, then why couch it in such degrading economic circumstances? Is it wise to underpay a workforce that the country relies upon for its economic stability? On the other hand, it\u2019s striking how the agricultural industry is cast in these terms whereas water, electricity and transport \u2013 all of which have been sold off to overseas investors who only care about their next dividend \u2013 isn\u2019t framed in the same way.</p> <p>We should all be in favour of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/18/the-uk-eu-battle-over-free-movement-and-terms-of-trade\">free movement of workers</a> because it makes Britain such an interesting and diverse place. But we ought to question the ultra-low wages that some industries use to exploit that mobility. This is not about immigration or ethnicity. It\u2019s about the warped way in which work is valued in our society. It\u2019s like we live in an upside down world. Jobs that are the most vital socially \u2013 rubbish collectors, cleaners, care givers, midwives, produce pickers \u2013 are economically valued the least.</p>",

It includes this expression of compassionate concern over the plight of low-lying island nations that are being engulfed by rising seas:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Some of the biggest supporters of the Paris accord are small oceanic nations seeking </em><em>welfare through handouts to save them from baseless predictions of rising sea levels, </em><em>even though actual changes in sea levels are tiny and not unusual.</em></p> <p><em>The fact is that sea level rise in Tuvalu has been effectively zero since accurate </em><em>measurements commenced in 1993, on tide gauges set up by the Australian </em><em>government</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This purported fact <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/Tuvalu-sea-level-rise.htm\">is actually a fiction</a>: <a href=\"http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/rlr.monthly.data/1839.rlrdata\">the tide gauge data</a> show the rate of sea level rise in Tuvalu since 1993 is 4.3 mm per year, which is faster than <a href=\"http://sealevel.colorado.edu/\">the global average of 3.4 mm per year</a>. And Tuvalu is only one among <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/islands-threatened-by-climate-change-2012-10\">the many small island nations facing the loss of their homelands</a> at the hands of global warming-caused sea level rise.</p> <p>However, when it comes to energy use, Clexit\u2019s compassion for developing countries becomes even clearer yet:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>For developing countries, the Paris Treaty would deny them the benefits of reliable low-cost hydrocarbon energy, compelling them to rely on biomass heating and costly weather-dependent and unreliable power supplies, thus prolonging and increasing their dependency on international handouts. They will soon resent being told to remain forever in an energy-deprived wind/solar/wood/bicycle economy. </em></p> </blockquote> <p>The problem with energy from burning fossil fuels is that it\u2019s only \u201clow-cost\u201d if we ignore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/04/climate-change-will-blow-a-25tn-hole-in-global-financial-assets-study-warns\">the tremendous costs of the damages its carbon pollution causes</a> via climate change. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/oct/27/global-warming-could-be-more-devastating-for-the-economy-than-we-thought\">Poorer countries are particularly vulnerable to those costs</a>, both because they lack the wealth and resources to adapt to them, and because they tend to be located in already-hot geographic regions near the equator. <br></p> <p>There\u2019s a reason why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/04/consensus-of-economists-cut-carbon-pollution\">95% of expert economists agree that we should cut carbon pollution</a>. Of course, the Clexiters deny that carbon dioxide is a pollutant:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Carbon dioxide is NOT a dangerous pollutant \u2013 it is a natural, non-toxic and beneficial </em><em>gas which feeds all life on earth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>However, this was long ago decided in the courts. In 2007, the US Supreme Court ruled that the State of Massachusetts had legal standing to sue the EPA for its refusal to regulate greenhouse gases, specifically because Massachusetts showed that it was being harmed by global warming via sea level rise encroaching on its shores. In that case, <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-pollutant-advanced.htm\">the Supreme Court ruled that carbon dioxide is a pollutant</a>.</p> <p>In response to the Supreme Court decision, the EPA issued an endangerment finding concluding that, based on the available scientific evidence, <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-pollutant-advanced.htm\">carbon dioxide endangers public health and welfare, and must therefore be regulated as a pollutant</a>.</p> <p>The Clexiters deny that vast body of scientific evidence. In addition to sea level rise, their summary statement denies <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/lindzen-illusion-6-importance-of-ghgs.html\">the major role of carbon dioxide in the Earth\u2019s greenhouse effect</a>, that <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/medieval-warm-period-intermediate.htm\">current global temperatures are hotter than they\u2019ve been in over 2,000 years</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-positives-negatives-intermediate.htm\">dangers of ongoing climate change</a>, that <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/ice-age-predictions-in-1970s-intermediate.htm\">most climate scientists were predicting global warming in the 1970s</a>, and so on.</p> <p>It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that the Clexit group denies basic climate science, since the only climate scientist on their committee is <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/richardson-2013-man-made-carbon.html\">Ole Humlum, who has done some very shoddy research on fossil fuels and carbon pollution</a>. The group effectively asks that we all reject the conclusions of <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024/meta;jsessionid=6AB66F8B1F75942D14A194F55F99C5D8.c4.iopscience.cld.iop.org\">97% of climate science experts</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/04/consensus-of-economists-cut-carbon-pollution\">95% of economics experts</a>, in favor of the myths and misinformation propagated by their fake experts. Perhaps, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/21/in-defence-of-experts-whether-they-support-leave-or-remain/\">as top Leave campaigner Michael Gove said</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em> people in this country have had enough of experts</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Gove also pushed to remove climate change from school curriculums, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jul/05/michael-gove-climate-change-geography-curriculum\">before backing down</a>. <br></p> <p>Fortunately, given <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/18/what-the-world-thinks-about-climate-change-in-7-charts/\">the high level of global concern about climate change</a>, Clexit faces a much tougher road to success than Brexit, because a Clexit victory would be a disaster for the rest of us.<br></p>",

What it was when it started I know not but when I got there in \u201986 the scene was already well established; clubs all over London, flowers blooming in the sticks. You could make a living doing it. You\u2019d do open spots, if they went well, half-spots \u2013 10 minutes, paid, then a full 20, and the hope in the distant future of an extended set: 30 or 40 minutes, dreamland. There were so many clubs in London you could do several in a night.</p> <p>The classic format was three acts and a compere, one interval. Rooms above pubs, rooms below pubs, Jacksons Lane Community Centre, Bunjies folk club, the TGWU centre Wood Green, the Red Rose Labour Club; small theatres, arts centres, student unions: those were the rooms in which it happened. But what was \u201calternative comedy\u201d?</p> <p>\u201cAlternative\u201d isn\u2019t much of a description. There wasn\u2019t a mainstream comedy circuit for it to be an alternative to, not round Islington anyway. It sprang up at no one\u2019s behest but that of the people doing it. Perhaps on one level it was a practical refutation of Thatcher\u2019s doctrine of \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d, which, along with her \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as society\u201d, are the three great pillars upon which the glory of modern Britain is gaffer-taped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82136a4f03fbdaf86069033b7b164b8706065df5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82136a4f03fbdaf86069033b7b164b8706065df5/436_566_1423_1779/800.jpg\" alt=\"Hat\u2019s off to Simon Munnery.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hat\u2019s off to Simon Munnery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edward Moore</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jul/22/simon-munnery-funniest-thing\">Simon Munnery: \u2018I laughed so hard I fell off the toilet\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alternative comedy\u2019s three tenets were: anti-racist, anti-sexist, do your own material. Other than that you were free to do as you pleased. There was variety, more so than now: poets, jugglers, magicians, improvising double acts, clowns, and acts beyond genre \u2013 The Ice Man, for example, who used to melt ice, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/nov/23/andrew-bailey-alternative-comedy\">Andrew Bailey in his many guises</a>. I saw him once, at The Earth Exchange, come on with a marigold glove and a compressed air cylinder and slowly inflate the glove, for 20 minutes. It was hilarious, but I don\u2019t think any of us could say why. And then there was Jerry Sadowitz, who came in like a whirlwind and made it suddenly possible to say \u201ccunt\u201d.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t even called comedy then, it was cabaret. We all had hair back then as well, masses of it, often in tightly packed curls. Some of us ate fruit, none of us gave a fuck. Things were vibrant, political, amphibious. A gig was a place where anything might happen, but probably wouldn\u2019t. The seething despair of the audiences was palpable; a gig was a forum, a crucible, a cathartic safety valve. If it hadn\u2019t been for alternative comedy there would probably have been a revolution by now. But do they thank us?</p> <p>Today there exists The Alternative Comedy Memorial Society, a ramshackle cabaret extravaganza. But are they right, that alternative comedy is over? Well, yes and no. Even as they claim to memorialise it they keep it alive.</p> <p>As for me, I\u2019ve gone on for 30 years. In the modern world it\u2019s an unusual thing to do something for an extended period, longer than an hour say. Unless it\u2019s masturbation or Facebook. Somehow it\u2019s almost shameful to have gone on this long. I should have made it by now, or given up. But I refuse to do either, or perhaps I\u2019ve done both?</p> <p>For some standup is a vehicle, a means to get somewhere else: telly, Hollywood, the moon. But what drew me in to begin with still draws me in today: the laughter of a crowd, the sharing of a laugh, all laughing as one.

At some point in these Rio Games the US will win their 1,000th gold medal in a summer Olympics. Presumably this will not be celebrated with cannons of confetti and a banner with a number 1,000 the size of a small SUV. But gold medals are important to the US so you never know.</p> <p>So far that pursuit has not been as fast as everyone might have hoped. Two days into the Olympics, American athletes have only one gold medal to go with five silvers and a bronze. It is not the haul of a powerhouse. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/aug/05/rio-olympics-2016-medal-table-and-results-in-full\">The Guardian\u2019s handy interactive medal traker</a> has the US in sixth place behind Australia, Italy, China, Korea and Hungary. Obviously it is just two days into the Olympics and things can change quickly. We are only starting to get into the big swimming and gymnastics events where the US dominates and still have track and field lingering next week. America\u2019s medal count will explode.</p> <p>Still, it is weird to see the US languishing in fifth place on an Olympics medal chart. And there have been some disappointments already. Their narrow loss to Australia in the women\u2019s 4x100m freestyle relay wasn\u2019t a surprise \u2013 Australia won gold in the event in 2012 \u2013 but the closeness of the race made the defeat sting. Venus Williams\u2019s illness this weekend that led to to her losing her singles match to 67<sup>th</sup>-ranked Kirsten Flipkens and the Williams sisters\u2019 doubles defeat on Sunday was a signifiant blow.</p> <p>In a few days this will probably all be forgotten. By then America\u2019s swimmers and gymnasts will have delivered their predicted wins and all those gold medallions will gleam in the lights for NBC. Everyone will talk excitedly about American dominance at the Olympics. No one will remember those first few days when Australia ruled Rio. By then, attention will have turned to a bigger question.</p> <p>Who will get that 1,000th summer gold for the US? Only 22 more medals to go. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a7c59ee4b03b51a99e0e38\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-07T23:36:37.658Z\">12.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Simone Biles will be one of the most famous people on the planet by the time the Olympics up (well, she\u2019ll be in the top 12,000 anyway) and she kicked off her Olympic campaign today.

  "<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-job-vacancies-fall-700000-in-the-week-after-brexit-data-shows-a7124686.html\">data by CEB</a>, job adverts fell by 700,000 in the week after the British people voted to leave the European Union. So if you were thinking of changing jobs, you may be thinking you should put your CV on ice. No one likes uncertainty and until there is more clarity about our future relationship with the EU and the impact of a Brexit on the jobs market, the outlook is uncertain. </p> <p>However, we need to focus on the positives. It may not be as bad as we fear \u2013 the UK is still the sixth <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2016/06/24/france-overtakes-uk-as-fifth-largest-economy-as-pound-plummets-5964746/\">largest economy</a> in the world; plus, findings from a <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/agentssummary/2016/jul.aspx\">Bank of England survey</a> of its nationwide agents revealed that two thirds of firms are pressing on with hiring plans as normal.</p> <p>Now is actually the time to start thinking how you can turn the current situation to your advantage and get ahead of the game.</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t think everyone has stopped recruiting</strong></h2> <p>The news would certainly have us believe that employers are not hiring, but actually it is likely that firms who put recruitment on hold pre-Brexit now need to fill the vacancies they froze until the EU referendum result was announced. </p> <p>Do your research and check whether the industry you are interested in is advertising. And be proactive by sending out tailored applications to the companies you want to work for \u2013 they might just arrive in a recruiting manager\u2019s inbox at the right time. Remember that August is always a bit quieter on the job front but the autumn will see an increase in recruitment, so be ready.</p> <h2><strong>Odds of getting a job may improve as others give up</strong></h2> <p>Competition for jobs may be reduced post-referendum, as many job hunters assume it\u2019s not a good time to apply for jobs, and there may be fewer EU nationals applying for roles in the UK. </p> <h2><strong>Prepare and get ready to be proactive</strong></h2> <p>If you feel more cautious or your industry is more affected by the referendum result, as is financial services for example, then you may decide to put your job search on hold. If you do, then use the time you have to prepare.</p> <h2></h2> <p>Investing time in crafting a really strong CV and updating your LinkedIn profile will reap benefits. Again, do your research and think about what you can bring to a company \u2013 what changes might a potential Brexit cause in your industry, and how can you contribute? You can drill down even further and consider what leaving the EU will mean to your profession and what new skills or knowledge you could focus on developing to be able to deal with future challenges.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/may/23/work-after-brexit-the-biggest-winners-and-losers-for-uk-jobs\">Work after Brexit: the biggest winners and losers for UK jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Make sure you highlight these areas in your applications \u2013 it demonstrates you are thinking strategically and are commercially aware.</p> <h2><strong>Attend networking events and schedule lunches</strong></h2> <p> Employers will continue to recruit using non-traditional routes, so building a sound network and letting your contacts know that you\u2019re looking for a job can be an effective way to hear about potential vacancies. It is also a good way to find out what employers will be looking for post-Brexit. Be clear about your message and how you can add value.</p> <h2><strong>Re-evaluate and reach out to recruiters</strong></h2> <p>Similarly, taking time to develop strong relationships with recruiters is a good investment of your time. Find out which agencies your industry respects and uses, and work hard to get to meet them so you can talk about what you have to offer and what you want to get from your next role. Sometimes the small boutique agencies can offer a more personalised service, and also give you useful feedback on the market trends and what employers are looking for.</p> <h2><strong>Stay positive</strong></h2> <p>Having an optimistic outlook will be attractive to potential employers. When times are tough, employers want team members who help maintain morale rather than contributing to the office moans. Make sure at interviews that you show how resilient you are and how you can cope with adversity. These will be valuable and sought-after traits in the coming months.</p> <p><em>Sarah Archer is a career coach and co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.careertree.org.uk/\">CareerTree</a>.</em></p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

  "<p>With the summer holidays upon us we have had a flurry of complaints from readers who have fallen for copycat websites that aim to dupe those applying for an Esta permit (the US\u2019s online visa system) and, to a lesser extent, the Ehic health insurance card into paying unnecessary fees.</p> <p>Under the terms of the Visa Waiver Program, all Britons entering the US are required to apply online at <a href=\"https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/\" title=\"https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/\">esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta</a>, at least 72 hours prior to travel and pay a $14 (\u00a310.60) fee. From April this year, they also need to hold a biometric passport with a built-in chip.</p> <p>However, unscrupulous operators have set up copycat websites, where the sole purpose seems to be to catch out the unwary and get them to hand over an additional service or administration fee. They do so by making their website look like the official site, or by just hoping that some consumers don\u2019t know better and will pay them for the unnecessary service.</p> <p>Guardian Money has repeatedly warned about this issue, but despite moves by Google and promises of action by UK ministers, it shows no sign of going away. There is even a warning about fake sites on the official Esta site.</p> <p>The free Ehic card gives access to state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area country and Switzerland. Although the service, at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/european-health-insurance-card\" title=\"https://www.gov.uk/european-health-insurance-card\">gov.uk/european-health-insurance-card</a>, was temporarily unavailable online immediately after the result of the Brexit referendum due to a technical glitch, it is now up and running as normal.</p> <p>Copycat websites still provide the Ehic card, but charge an unnecessary fee.

  "<p>The revelation that some building materials imported to Australia are contaminated with asbestos shows the fight to eradicate this deadly mineral is not only far from over, it cannot be limited by national boundaries, particularly when we live in a global economy.</p> <p>Australian authorities have put a hold on Yuanda China building materials after <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-14/asbestos-found-in-perth-childrens-hospital-roof-panels/7628108\">asbestos was discovered</a> in some of its supplies to two major construction projects, including \u2013 of all places \u2013 at the Perth Children\u2019s Hospital.</p> <p>As someone who has spent my entire career seeking justice for those afflicted by the awful diseases associated with asbestos and witnessing first-hand its devastating effect on families, it\u2019s hard to quantify how deeply frustrating and concerning it is to read that these contaminated products are slipping through our borders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/05/peter-dutton-denounced-for-suggesting-import-of-asbestos-is-cfmeus-fault\">Peter Dutton denounced for suggesting import of asbestos is CFMEU's fault</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But despite that deep disappointment, I must admit these revelations haven\u2019t come as a complete surprise. After all, China and India are among the top five producers of asbestos in the world.</p> <p>For many of our neighbours, asbestos remains an accessible and cheap building material \u2013 two particularly attractive features when a country is in the grip of rapid development and industrialisation. India, China, Indonesia and Thailand are all importing asbestos at a phenomenal rate with devastating consequences for its workers and people.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation estimates a staggering 125 million people around the world are exposed to asbestos in the workplace each year. And as dreadful as that figure is, in reality it\u2019s probably much greater since asbestos has such an insidious reach.</p> <p>The Australian experience has shown exposure can occur through washing contaminated clothing, home renovation and demolition or even when children play in poorly disposed building products. The recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/02/-sp-mr-fluffy-cancerous-legacy-canberra\">\u201cMr Fluffy\u201d saga </a>was another reminder that we treat asbestos casually at our peril.</p> <p>So when we superimpose this picture of so-called \u201cbystander\u201c exposure on to the World Health Organisation\u2019s statistics we\u2019re looking at a phenomenon of catastrophic proportions for decades to come.</p> <p>While Australia stopped using asbestos in building materials in the 1980s, it was only 13 years ago that we banned it entirely. It took years of campaigning and the repeated airing of the tragic individual stories of disease and death before we reached that goal.</p> <p>Clearly, the recent revelation about contaminated imports raises questions about the resourcing of our relevant agencies. An independent review of Australia\u2019s asbestos border controls is <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/foreign-affairs/no-time-to-stop-imports-of-asbestos-border-guards/news-story/e3e4cf6843655dfd9e79f6c699ca6475\">calling for prosecutions to be pursued more vigorously</a> and more information to be given to the suppliers. It also found that Australian Border Force did not have the \u201ctime and resources\u201d to stop asbestos slipping through our borders.</p> <p>But once we strengthen procedures for testing imports and reiterate the Australian asbestos ban to overseas exporters, what next? Surely it\u2019s time to turn our attention to helping the campaign to bring a world-wide end to the mining and the use of asbestos.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/04/asbestos-deregulation-australia\">Asbestos: who is accountable when things go wrong?  | Dominic Kelly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In recent years, there have been a number of efforts to bring about such change from global organisations, including the World Health Organisation. But these campaigns are still nascent and will no doubt need the persuasive power that comes with direct diplomatic and trade relations between governments. It\u2019s time for all our domestic stakeholders from government and business through to the union movement and medical and legal experts to help local campaigners in their fight.</p> <p>The key will be not only convincing our neighbouring governments that it is both cruel and uneconomical in the long term to allow asbestos use to continue, but that there are safer substitutes. This will require the efforts of many more than Australia, but we owe it to our citizens and our neighbours in the South East Asian region to push for this change.</p> <p>Sadly, it is not yet time to rest easy when it comes to asbestos. The use of asbestos is far from a legacy issue \u2013 tragically, it will remain a critical public health issue in our region for many years to come and that means it\u2019s an issue Australia can\u2019t afford to ignore</p>"
