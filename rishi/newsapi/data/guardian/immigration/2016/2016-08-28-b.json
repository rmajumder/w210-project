  "<p>\u201cIt looks like remain have won,\u201d Nigel Farage said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/23/voters-still-divided-as-eu-referendum-polls-close\" title=\"\">as the polls closed on 23 June</a>. To concede defeat on the brink of victory was one of the outgoing Ukip leader\u2019s more erratic actions. Another was the decision to stand down over the party\u2019s weak showing in the 2015 general election and then, days later, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/11/nigel-farage-withdraws-resignation-as-ukip-leader\" title=\"\">retract the resignation</a>. The implication was that Ukip could not survive without Mr Farage but also that Mr Farage could not imagine life after Ukip.</p> <p>He must be glad that he waited another year before quitting again. He now leaves bathed in the glory of a referendum result that he strived for years to achieve, while washing his hands of responsibility for the consequences. He gets invited to appear as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/nigel-farage-donald-trump-rally-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">the exotic support act</a> at a Donald Trump rally. But he does not have to resolve the&#xa0;question of Ukip\u2019s purpose now that its best-known mission has been accomplished. That&#xa0;task falls to his successor, elected over a&#xa0;two-week period beginning on 1 September.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the need to ponder the party\u2019s place in post-referendum Britain has not been a feature of the Ukip contest so far. Petty factional bickering has instead been the dominant motif. The victor seems likely to be either <a href=\"http://www.dianejamesmep.com/\" title=\"\">Diane James</a>, currently an MEP, or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lisaduffy1968\" title=\"\">Lisa Duffy</a>, a Cambridgeshire councillor. In policy terms, their pronouncements have been unremarkably Faragist. James praises Vladimir Putin; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/ukips-lisa-duffy-wants-to-ban-muslim-veil-in-public-venues\" title=\"\">Duffy decries intrusions of Islamic faith</a> into public space.</p> <p>Whatever the outcome of the contest, the trajectory of Ukip is towards more aggressive fomenting of rage, paranoia and xenophobia. The practicalities of Brexit will demand some compromise by the government, against which Ukip will rail. Yet even a thorough severing of relations with the continent will not end migration from overseas, reverse demographic change established over decades or transform economic opportunities for people currently without the qualifications or skills to find security in&#xa0;a&#xa0;competitive labour market.</p> <p>So the economic and cultural drivers of Ukip support will not be removed by any form of Brexit, while the proxy of blaming everything on Brussels will be less available. So new scapegoats will be found. A narrative of Brexit betrayal will take hold. And Euroscepticism is likely to congeal into more pungent nationalism. How far that project can go depends in part on the skill of the leader. At the top of his game, Mr Farage had a knack for packaging poisonous messages in media-friendly banality. He was dangerous because he knew how to push incrementally at the boundaries of tolerable discourse, smuggling far-right idiom into the mainstream. He was also lucky to have David Cameron as a foil \u2013 a Tory leader who was distrusted by many of his party\u2019s core supporters and who yielded to Europhobic pressure whenever it was applied.</p> <p>Mr Farage\u2019s successor will have an equivalent opportunity to capitalise on Labour\u2019s turmoil. In the 2015 general election, <a href=\"http://www.fabians.org.uk/the-ukip-tipping-point/\" title=\"\">Ukip came second to Labour</a> in scores of seats, many coinciding with areas of high support for Brexit. A dysfunctional Labour opposition, perceived in its former heartlands as soft on immigration and queasy around patriotism, could be savaged by a well-organised nationalist challenger under shrewd, charismatic leadership. Judging by the Ukip contest thus far, that is&#xa0;mercifully&#xa0;not imminent.</p> <p>There is some potential for Faragism to grow stronger in Britain without Farage. There is also a chance that Ukip will implode in acrimony and slink back to the fringe. The best-case scenario is one in which the parties of the mainstream develop strategies for addressing the resentments that give succour to virulent illiberal reaction. Although the referendum result expressed a depth of grievance with the EU, it would be naive to think that EU membership was the root cause or that Brexit will dissipate all of the pent-up rage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/26/forget-nigel-farage-people-ukip-exploits\" title=\"\">against \u201cestablishment\u201d politics</a>.</p> <p>Referendum victory has disoriented a party that was fuelled by perpetual frustration. Referendum defeat would have better fitted Ukip\u2019s familiar modus operandi. The future was clearer as the victim of a conspiracy than as the victor with nothing left to say. A party of perpetual protest that gets what it wants has to find other things to protest against. Ukip will now seek to reboot its campaign against liberal values, tolerance and diversity in Britain. That project can only succeed if other parties indulge and accommodate the new leader, repeating the mistakes that gave Mr Farage\u2019s tenure the happy ending even he hadn\u2019t dared to expect.</p>",
  "<p>Just as the first cuckoos welcome spring, so the first newspaper serialisations of political memoirs herald the party conference season, with its fetid brew of intrigue, rebellion at the fringes and dead-eyed choreography on the central stage. This year, the first claimant upon posterity\u2019s favour is Ed Balls, who \u2013 while preparing for his appearance on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/08/ed-balls-strictly-come-dancing-bbc-2016\">Strictly Come Dancing</a> \u2013 has been finishing off a political autobiography, <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1112376/speaking-out/\">Speaking Out</a>.

Just follow my lead</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The former shadow chancellor and close lieutenant to Gordon Brown has long been a divisive figure: when I was editor of the Spectator, a prominent Blairite offered me a piece on the theme \u201cWhy Ed Balls is to blame for all of Labour\u2019s problems\u201d (the outraged Friend of Tony withdrew the offer after he had calmed down). At any rate, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/ed-balls-loses-morley-and-outwood-seat-shadow-chancellor-labour-general-election\">Balls lost his Morley and Outwood seat last year,</a> there was plenty of crowing among his notional comrades.</p> <p>Curiously enough, however, a surprising proportion of those who disagree with Balls ideologically concede that he is a warm and stimulating companion. He never hit it off with David Cameron but got on well with George Osborne (I have heard both men say independently that they enjoy going for a drink together: intellect is a powerful adhesive).</p> <p>So I have high hopes for the Book of Balls, which will compete this autumn with memoirs by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EtAC3ERpvg\">Ken Clarke</a> and Sir <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/books_and_poetry/14666179.__39_The_most_interesting_thing_is_the_index__39____Review__Malcolm_Rifkind__Power_and_Pragmatism/\">Malcolm Rifkind</a>, and the forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/hodder-publish-brexit-inside-story-camerons-comms-director-364386\">account of the EU referendum campaign by Cameron\u2019s communications chief, Sir Craig Oliver</a>. Certainly, the extracts published thus far by the Times, accompanied by a lengthy interview, have been an evocative reminiscence of an age that already feels long gone.</p> <p>Through the author\u2019s eyes, we are back in the world of Brown, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1998/dec/24/labour.labour1997to99\">Peter Mandelson\u2019s sensational resignation</a> in 1998, IMF summits in Hong Kong, a 7am meeting in Helsinki in 1999 at which Balls \u201carrived to find Tony in a white dressing gown, and Gordon in his full suit, as tended to be their way\u201d. These were Labour\u2019s rollercoaster years in office, during which the party far exceeded its electoral success in the past, winning three successive terms with substantial majorities (two of them huge).</p> <p>As even the Tories had to acknowledge, it had become a serious party of government, its upper echelons populated by serious and weighty figures. It is extraordinary to reflect that this era in Labour\u2019s history ended only six years ago, and to consider how much has changed since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/10/gordon-brown-labour-leadership-resignation\">Brown left Downing Street</a>. As Balls says of Jeremy Corbyn: \u201cIf you are the kind of person who feels that you are succeeding when you have a rally of your supporters cheering you, well, that\u2019s not my conception of politics. My conception of politics is that you succeed when sceptical centre-ground voters decide to trust you more than the other side.\u201d Until Labour grasps that Balls is right and Corbyn is wrong, it will remain an intermittently distracting sideshow, confusing its impotent anger for fiery relevance.</p> <p>All the same, nostalgia is the foe of objective analysis: as depressing as it is to observe the decline of Labour from a mighty party of power to a pious protest movement, a candid chronicler of that transformation will detect many of its roots in the conduct of New Labour\u2019s oligarchs and their acolytes between Blair\u2019s leadership victory in 1994 and the defeat of Ed Miliband in 2015.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/29/labour-election-victories-in-perspective\">Labour\u2019s election victories in perspective | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, Balls was a key figure in Labour\u2019s most electorally glorious epoch. But that epoch also set the stage for what has happened since. During the 1990s the party\u2019s elite drained power from Labour\u2019s traditional structures and centralised all significant authority in the leader and his or her entourage. Yet even as the party\u2019s oligarchs preached the virtues of discipline to the mass membership, they themselves fought one another with shameless ferocity. First it was Blair and Brown; then Brown and David Miliband (of whom Balls says: \u201cIn the end, I don\u2019t think David had the political tenacity\u201d); then the two Eds, leader and shadow chancellor. Balls claims \u2013 astonishingly \u2013 that he and Miliband had only two proper conversations during the 2015 election campaign. He also recalls his resentment that \u201cregularly from 2010 onwards there would be briefings from his team against me, about me being sacked. Every time I would see him he would be very upset about it, but it never seemed to stop happening.\u201d If ever there were a textbook example of Freud\u2019s \u201cnarcissism of small differences\u201d, it was this relentless tendency of Labour\u2019s elite between 1994 and 2015 to split into two warring factions.</p> <p>Corbynism, with its implacable emphasis upon the party-as-movement and the role of the rank and file, was the inevitable reaction to the structural revolution that began in 1994 and to its pathologies. Iraq, the leadership\u2019s bid to have it both ways over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/12/harman-labour-not-vote-against-welfare-bill-limit-child-tax-credits\">Osborne\u2019s austerity programme</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/24/labour-scotland-scots-snp-nationalism-18-years\">loss of Scotland</a> to the SNP, the party elite\u2019s shameless in-fighting: all this was the backdrop to the grassroots rebellion that secured the leadership for Corbyn last year, and will probably do so once again in his current contest with Owen Smith.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/28/labour-leadership-interesting-experiment-corbyn\">Labour\u2019s \u2018interesting experiment\u2019 in comradeship will run and run | Andrew Rawnsley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Important as Labour\u2019s destiny is, it is eclipsed by the future of the country. I suspect this autumn\u2019s haul of political books will be remembered predominantly for what they disclose about Brexit, its causes and its aftermath. In which respect, Balls makes two related claims: first, that the \u201cpersonalisation\u201d of the vote around Cameron\u2019s character was \u201ca catastrophe\u201d. Second, he believes that the remain campaign in the EU referendum needed a counterpart to Brown\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/20/gordon-brown-scotland-yes-no-unite-common-future\">promise to the Scots</a> in 2014 of more reform if they voted to stay in the union: the so-called vow.</p> <p>According to Balls, the UK electorate should have been promised more than the status quo, modified by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/02/eu-deal-key-points-what-cameron-wanted-and-what-he-got\">Cameron\u2019s \u201crenegotiation\u201d</a> of Britain\u2019s terms of membership. They should have been promised a rolling process of reform \u2013 as at least one senior Tory recognised: \u201cGeorge [Osborne] said that he was very conscious of the status quo point and thought, like in Scotland, we would need to come back with a vow-style commitment to reform, including around immigration, in the final week or two.\u201d Or, to translate: it wasn\u2019t me or George, guv.</p> <p>Two months have passed since Britain decided to leave the EU.

  "<p>A British athlete who was trying to run, cycle and swim from Marble Arch in London to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris has died crossing the Channel.</p> <p>Nick Thomas got into trouble in the water near Calais, according to Enduroman \u2013 the event\u2019s organisers. The 45-year-old from the Shropshire town of Ellesmere, near the Welsh border, had been swimming for 16 hours.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation confirmed a man had died, but added he was doing what he loved. \u201cA swimmer was taken from the water less than a mile from the finish in France,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was an extremely experienced support team on board the support vessel.</p> <p>\u201cHe was given CPR and taken to Calais where he was sadly pronounced dead. It is an extreme sport, we know the risks. He was doing what he loved doing. Our thoughts are with his family.\u201d</p> <p>Enduroman, based in Dorset, says the Arch to Arc event includes an 87-mile run from London to the south coast and a 181-mile bicycle ride to Paris. In between, athletes must complete the Channel swim \u2013 usually 21 miles and in water temperatures of 16C (61F) or below.</p> <p>Tweets posted by Enduroman suggested that winds and the tides had made the going particularly tough. The Channel Swimming Association says it can take between seven and 27 hours to complete the swim, partly because the tides and current can move swimmers away from the nearest point to make landfall in France. The company describes the \u201cextreme event\u201d as being suitable only for \u201cexperienced ultra-distance athletes\u201d.

A Morning Consult survey <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2016/08/28/trump-gains-ground-clinton-black-voters-still-wary/\">released</a> on Sunday found Clinton leading by only three points, 43-40, in a head-to-head matchup.

This squares with a Quinnipiac <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us08252016_U88mxwn.pdf\">survey last week</a> finding that 90% of likely voters have already made up their minds.</p> <p>The defibrillator now attached to the Trump campaign is in some ways plain to see. In the past two weeks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump\">the campaign leadership has been remade</a>, the candidate has redoubled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-dwyane-wade-cousin-shooting-reaction\">outreach to non-white voters</a> and the campaign has spent its first millions on TV ads in battleground states.</p> <p>A shift by Trump on immigration, particularly given the influence of Hispanic voters in a number of battleground states, would seem of a piece with those changes.

She could have chosen immigration. If the conventional wisdom is now that the leave vote was a yelp of outrage, the attendant consensus is that foreigners were its source.</p> <p>The prime minister went instead to the issue that is the functional, rhetorical and ideological opposite of immigration: inequality. She has ordered <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-orders-government-audit-to-tackle-racial-disparities-in-public-service-outcomes\" title=\"\">a government audit into racial disparities in public service outcomes</a>. By 2017, a citizen armed only with his or her age, postcode and racial profile will be able to determine the likelihood of being unemployed, detained under the Mental Health Act, arrested or excluded from school.</p> <p>The audit will be updated annually. There are reasons to be sceptical, principally the simultaneous announcement of huge cuts to NHS services, which makes a mockery of the language. It\u2019s no good becoming more equal just because everybody\u2019s access to healthcare has worsened. Yet the fact is, she has done something exceptional.</p> <p>With bold, relentless and unscrupulous repetition, the combined forces of the leave movement established truisms that were never true: that immigrants milked the benefits system, filled up the insufficient housing and put unbearable pressure on public services.

She has eschewed the fiction of direct causation \u2013 that your low wages are the result of a cheaper foreigner \u2013 in favour of indirect causation: your wages are ratcheted down by your limited opportunities. She treats the new distrust of experts with the respect it deserves \u2013 precisely none \u2013 and sets about creating the data set from which expertise proceeds.</p> <p>She has done more than reject the Crosbyfication of politics, which demands every debate be reduced to its basest question. She has chosen her own frame for the debate.</p> <p>It is unlikely, of course, that she\u2019ll be able to act on her findings. Having simultaneously kicked off this audit, and Brexit, with a data-heavy, sector-by-sector analysis of what every business wants and needs, she\u2019ll wind up in 2017 with a roomful of beautiful data visualisations, all requiring contradictory actions.</p> <p>Let\u2019s say we intuit correctly that some elegant way will be found to avoid Brexit; possibly laying out its implications, slowly and clearly enough, will suffice. Inequality is different. As evidence of it builds and deepens over time, the old platitudinous equilibrium, where everyone is against it but nobody thinks they can do anything about it, will become harder to maintain.</p> <p>Inequality is highly abstract and seems to have a momentum of its own, given that it constantly travels in the opposite direction to the one everybody claims to want. This gives it the inevitability of gravity or weather. The academic\u2019s answer is to try tethering it back to something concrete and actionable, with demonstrable outcomes: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-18917932\" title=\"\">a wealth disparity of X leads to a longevity difference of Y</a>.</p> <p>As vital as that is, it answers only half the question: how do we know that inequality is damaging? It doesn\u2019t answer the more important riddle, the one that would wrest from inequality its status as a physical feature of the universe, and bring it back to level of human agency: by what mechanism does inequality do this damage? How can one child\u2019s education be stunted by the existence of a richer child five streets away? How does one person\u2019s bonus drive down another\u2019s wages?</p> <p>The answers lie not in regrettable prejudice but in balance of power: as profit is distributed more towards capital than labour, and the workforce becomes more precarious, its precariousness can be leveraged against it to drive down pay and conditions further, and the insecurity deepens. As capital concentrates and finds a haven in property, the balance of power shifts between landlords and tenants. Owning a house becomes impossible and rents get more expensive, creating a feedback loop where the power of the tenant in the workplace diminishes further, as saving becomes impossible.</p> <p>It would be unthinkable for a Conservative of any pedigree to formulate solutions to this. Yet with her focus, May will make the problem steadily more urgent, while furnishing&#xa0;more radical minds than her own with the evidence they need to make ambitious demands. Far from appropriating inequality for her own rhetorical&#xa0;advantage, as George Osborne did with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/08/budget-2015-uk-gdp-other-rich-nations-george-osborne\" title=\"\">\u201cliving wage\u201d</a>, May has&#xa0;actually opened it up as a field of play in which her own moves are obsolete and new thinking is not just possible but irresistible.</p>",
  "<p>As the current election cycle heads into its grueling 10,000th week (with a scant 700 more before the election) the campaigns of human hellmouth Donald Trump and presidency-seeking robot Hillary Clinton are both hard at work grinding for cash to stay afloat. While the larger cash injections to these campaigns seem to come from a complicated web of corporate pals, shady oligarchs and people who owe the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/clinton-foundation-bill-hillary-us-election-state-department\">Clinton Foundation</a> a favor, they\u2019re not above seeking a couple bucks from the average Joe, either.

They\u2019re frequently formatted in a style that\u2019s a little too similar to those scheming spam messages seeking your help to unlock an enormous African fortune held in place by international banking regulation, or promising longer lasting, more satisfying boners. The caps are locked, the graphics are lo-fi. A recent message from DCCC.org features splashes of red, green, and blue highlighting, and opens with a single-sentence paragraph: \u201cWe\u2019re freaking out.\u201d</p> <p>I get that the choice of words there is supposed to come off as relatable to the casual constituent, and scary enough to motivate donations \u2013 but isn\u2019t the idea of congressmen \u201cfreaking out\u201d a little upsetting? Hey, DCCC, \u201cfreaking out\u201d is reserved for college freshmen who just found out their roommate\u2019s cousin dated the drummer from Twenty One Pilots in 2006. We\u2019re counting on you chumps to govern us. You only get to publicly freak out when you either discover that an asteroid is on a collision course with Earth or your email gets hacked. That\u2019s it.</p> <p>Emails from the Clinton campaign are a bit nicer and more polished. I received one the other day purporting to be a personal note from Hillary that opened: \u201cFriend \u2013I\u2019ll keep this short because I know how much you already do for this team.\u201d</p> <p>Isn\u2019t that nice? We\u2019re friends; she knows I don\u2019t have all day to read emails; she\u2019s recognizing what I\u2019ve already done to service her commitment to the idea that she deserves to be president. </p> <p>The Trump campaign\u2019s latest messages offer an interesting incentive to donors \u2013Executive Membership. There\u2019s a graphic of a gold card that says \u201cTrump\u201d at the top, and at the bottom it has Trump\u2019s signature over \u201cAuthorized by the future President of the United States\u201d. Pretty cool, right? And get this \u2013 normally there\u2019s a one-time induction fee of $100, but for a limited time only they\u2019re slashing rates and offering the deal for the low, low price of 35 bucks.</p> <p>So the list of things the Trump campaign has in common with a late-night infomercial now includes: a cheap, garbage product you absolutely don\u2019t need; a spokesperson who is either feigning enthusiasm for cash or actually soulless; multiple vague promises to improve the quality of your life with little to no evidence the product can do what it claims; and limited time, low, low prices if you act fast.</p> <p>The only problems with the Trump campaign Executive Membership (beyond that it involves giving money to Donald Trump, the worst thing to happen to North America since \u2026 I don\u2019t know \u2026 the Jamestown settlement?) is that it isn\u2019t clear what the membership gets you. It\u2019s not even clear if you get that golden card.</p> <p> That\u2019s a big mistake. The Trump campaign needs to offer its Executive Members some perks. How about offering cardholders personalized messages explaining what Trump <em>meant to say </em>after each public statement and a strand of Mike Pence\u2019s weirdly brittle hair to use as a lockpick? And why stop there? How about a Super Executive Membership for $50, which could entitle members to a free consultation with a Trump campaign attorney following any violence they take part in at an authorized Trump rally? At the top level, there could be a Huge, Fantastic Membership, where for just $1,000 Trump will take you on a personal tour of the Kremlin.</p> <p>I don\u2019t get any contribution emails from third-party or independent candidates, because none of those people will ever be president and my time on Earth is ultimately finite, but I\u2019d be willing to guess that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/libertarian-gary-johnson-president\">Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson\u2019s</a> emails arrive totally blank, allowing recipients the freedom to decide how the text should appear.

Nevertheless, this fixture does pitch the premier outfits from two regional powerhouses. West Brom are the only top-flight team from the West Midlands (an area with 11 league titles), while Middlesbrough can claim pre-eminence in the north-east (10 titles) after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/21/sunderland-middlesbrough-premier-league-match-report\">beating Sunderland last Sunday</a>.</p> <p>Provincial pride aside, this rivalry isn\u2019t the fiercest. It\u2019s been six years since these two teams last met, with the Baggies winning the last four matches by an aggregate score of 11-0. Those games, played in the first and second tiers as both clubs slid out of the Premier League in 2009, were followed by West Brom securing an immediate return to the promised land, while their beaten opponents settled in the mire.</p> <p>As Boro battled their way back, West Brom set off on a run of six straight top-flight seasons, years of relentless boinging replaced with 11th, 10th, 8th, 17th, 13th and 14th placed finishes.

But the navy denied that it had fired directly at the MSF boat, and claimed it did not board the boat itself.</p> <p>\u201cA Libyan coastguard patrol was about 25 miles offshore. She observed an unidentified vessel to which the order was given to stop, but [the vessel] did not comply,\u201d Brig Ayoub Qassim, a spokesman for the Libyan navy, was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20160826-libye-bateau-msf-cible-attaque-armee-large-bourbon-argos-migrants\">quoted as saying by Radio France International</a>. </p> <p>Qassim added: \u201cWe fired five warning shots. We did not storm the boat, we are categorical [about that]. And the patrol then returned to the coast. We informed Operation Sophia\u201d \u2013 an EU naval operation based off the coast of Libya \u2013 \u201cof this incident and we have opened an investigation. We are the Libyan coastguard and the boat should stop and identify themselves.\u201d</p> <p>The Libyan navy\u2019s claims are inconsistent with MSF\u2019s account. The aid group says the attackers fired at least 13 bullets directly at its boat, some of which hit the ship\u2019s bridge, or control room. MSF also says the attackers boarded the boat for approximately 50 minutes.</p> <p>Qassim\u2019s claims are further complicated by the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/29/refugee-rescue-ship-bourbon-argos-eritreans-libya-msf\">the Bourbon Argos has been working openly in international waters off the Libyan coast for over a year</a>, rescuing tens of thousands of asylum seekers. Its activities have long been known to Libyan authorities, it is clearly branded with MSF\u2019s logo, and its identity is visible on the automatic identification system (AIS) to which all ships and naval authorities have access.</p> <p>The Libyan navy\u2019s actions potentially complicate the relationship between the Libyan authorities and Europe. The navy currently protects and houses the administration of Fayez al-Sarraj, the head of Libya\u2019s new internationally backed government, which has requested the support of western powers to bring stability to the war-torn country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/29/refugee-rescue-ship-bourbon-argos-eritreans-libya-msf\">A day on a refugee rescue ship: 'this job must be done, there must be no sinking'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in recent weeks Qassim has appeared keen to challenge this dynamic, criticising the EU for sending a naval fleet to the southern Mediterranean, known as Operation Sophia, that operates separately to MSF and other humanitarian groups. The fleet is nominally meant to apprehend people-smugglers, and also rescues migrants when necessary \u2013 but Qassim argued in a recent interview that the operation in fact had ulterior motives.</p> <p>\u201cDo we need military soldiers to intercept and rescue civilian boats and immigrants?\u201d he reportedly asked in <a href=\"http://www.libyaobserver.ly/news/navy-spokesman-operation-sophia-propaganda-italy-wants-have-more-time-continue-stealing-libya%E2%80%99s\">an interview with the Libyan Observer</a>, a news website. \u201cNo, those civilians need care and protection, not army personnel with guns and pistols. I think when the EU saw that the southern part of the Mediterranean, which lies opposite to Europe, especially the part that overlooks north African countries, had been reshaped by the revolutions as well as the security unrest, it wanted to form a permanent military force to be in the Mediterranean at all times.\u201d</p> <p>In response to Qassim\u2019s claims, MSF said its representatives were \u201ccurrently engaging with the Libyan authorities in order to clarify what happened exactly during the incident and to ensure that similar events, that can put people in physical danger, do not occur in the future\u201d. It added: \u201cOur main priority is to guarantee that humanitarian organisations like ours are able to continue to safely conduct search and rescue activities in the central Mediterranean with the aim of saving lives.\u201d</p> <p>MSF is one of several charities now working in the Mediterranean, independently of Operation Sophia. Collectively, they have rescued tens of thousands of asylum seekers in the past two years. Numbers of people crossing between Turkey and Greece have fallen drastically since March, but the level between Libya and Italy remains at near-record levels.</p> <p>So far in 2016, more than 100,000 people have reached Italy from north Africa. More than 3,100 have drowned in the Mediterranean since the start of the year.</p>",

She told her interviewer, Liz Hayes, that it was stupid to think she was fearful of foreigners.</p> <p>She was asked whether or not she hated Muslims, given the One Nation platform opposes immigration from Muslims and she has called for a royal commission into Islam. She said she did not hate Muslims or Asians. \u201cHate\u2019s a very strong word,\u201d Hanson said.</p> <p>She said she had taken to reading sections of the Qur\u2019an, which she carried in her handbag, to improve her understanding of the issues.</p> <p>At one point in the interview she professed herself to be openminded. \u201cTo think we are right 100% of the time is being naive and stupid.\u201d</p> <p>Hanson said she was happy to work with peace-loving Muslims \u201cto find answers\u201d.</p> <p>During the conversation the One Nation leader struggled to articulate a specific message she would like to send to Australian voters after her election. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the message I would send to them [would be].\u201d</p> <p>Hanson said she would always try to be honest, upfront and accountable to her supporters and she said she would have absolutely no difficultly plotting a decisive course for her Senate bloc. \u201cWhen the decisions have to be made, I will make them.\u201d</p> <p>Filmed in conversation with her new Senate colleagues, Hanson said she did not want One Nation to go the way of Clive Palmer\u2019s political party, which disintegrated rapidly during the last parliament.</p> <p>She suggested she had won support in the election in 2016 because voters needed someone to represent their interests, and Australians needed \u201chope\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI hope they give me a fair go and judge me on my performance and achievements,\u201d Hanson said.</p> <p>Her chief of staff, James Ashby, who came to public prominence when he worked for the former Speaker of the House of Representatives Peter Slipper, and later accused him of sexual harassment, made a couple of interventions during the 60 Minutes segment.</p> <p>He told Hayes he had decided to assist Hanson, whom he described as \u201cthis little redhead\u201d, because he felt she lacked professional support.</p> <p>Ashby said it was quite odd to return to federal parliament after his history there. \u201cI didn\u2019t like it at all.\u201d</p> <p>He noted that the best thing Hanson had at her disposal during her coming stint in federal politics was enormous reach on social media.

A reindeer herder, hunter and protector of the traditions of his people, he watches over his community and their traditional lands. He is the oldest man in the Dukha camp, a respected sage to whom the group listens. </p> <p>Originally from Russia, the Dukha (who are also called Tsataan in Mongolian) are closer in traditions and way of life to the Sami people, the reindeer herders of the Arctic, than to Mongols of the steppe, who are traditionally famers and live in gers.</p> <p>These Dukha nomads move their <em>ortz</em> according to the migrations of the reindeer in these wild mountains \u2013 the only environment favourable to their animals. They don\u2019t grow crops, or raise animals other than reindeer. They don\u2019t eat the reindeer, using them only for their milk and for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumance\">transhumance</a>.</p> <p>It was only after the second world war that the Dukha established themselves definitively in Mongolia. \u201cOur fathers were accustomed to migrating where they wanted to within the taiga,\u201d says Buyantogtoh, Ganbat\u2019s sister and the group\u2019s doyenne. \u201cWe knew no frontiers, and went wherever our reindeer had sufficient pasture. Then the war broke out, and the Russian soldiers wanted to recruit our men to go and fight far away from us. We fled to the south.

Known for their vast knowledge of the taiga and their capability as hunters, they were hired as \u201cstate hunters\u201d by Mongolia\u2019s communist government.</p> <p>Oltsen is one of the best hunters in the group, and is capable of confronting the bears that menace the reindeer herds. \u201cMy father was a state hunter,\u201d says Oltsen, proudly. \u201cHe hunted, would go down to the villages to bring the meat, and would return with vegetables and flour. This became more difficult after the fall of the communist government: he lost his job. But we have pursued commercial activity, selling furs and meat when we can. Tourists came as well, and we began to do crafts. They liked that.\u201d<br></p> <p>The situation has worsened: without a place in society, regarded as merely reindeer herders, the Dukha have become marginalised. In 2011, their lives changed radically. </p> <p>\u201cPeople came and told us that they had studied the taiga for 10 years,\u201d says Oltsen, bitterly. \u201cWe had never seen them. They explained to us that this territory had become a national reserve and that new laws had been put in place. They had decided that we couldn\u2019t hunt any more and that only three areas were authorised for the pasturing of our reindeer. We were no longer permitted to take them beyond the Tengis river and the Gugned Valley. But how would we live if we weren\u2019t able to hunt any more? </p> <p>\u201cTo make sure that we didn\u2019t hunt, they forbade us from bringing our dogs to guard the reindeer. But there are wolves here. Our herds were decimated. We don\u2019t have anything but our reindeer. It\u2019s our right to take care of them.\u201d<br></p> <p>Under Mongolian law, hunting is forbidden in the Tengis Shishged national reserve, as are fishing and chopping wood, and only limited migrations are allowed, in order to preserve biodiversity. Recently, rangers have been deployed to protect the area. Itn is easy to imagine how relations between these rangers \u2013 mainly young, urbanites \u2013 and the Dukha, who have dwelled in these lands for hundreds of years, rapidly became strained.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/global_dev_mongolia/giv-31075hJUYzYo1DM5x/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/global_dev_mongolia/giv-31075hJUYzYo1DM5x/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t let us live any more.

If these things are outlawed, we\u2019re no longer free.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo they want to make us Mongols of the steppe,\u201d asks Oltsen. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do anything other than live here. But I know the taiga better than anyone. I know every corner of this mountain. I know the animals and we show them respect, just as our fathers taught us. We communicate with nature. If I go hunting and don\u2019t see many animals, it means that nature isn\u2019t ready to give them to me and I go home. We lose our culture if we can\u2019t hunt any longer or can\u2019t keep our reindeer.

The Dukha aren\u2019t complaining about their new source of revenue, which allows them access to resources and luxuries they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have, yet they remain defiant when it comes to their tradition of preserving, in their own way, the land on which they live. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of them, even with their motorbikes and their park,\u201d Buyantogtoh says. \u201cWith or without them, we will conserve our forest.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t they come and talk with us?\u201d asks Ganbat. \u201cWe would tell them what to protect and where the animals are.

  "<p>Wilbert Hatcher admits he broke the law. </p> <p>In the depths of a decade-long addiction to prescription opioid painkillers, the father of two fed his craving by buying blackmarket pills on the streets of his small West Virginia town. He finally shook the addiction three years ago. But now Hatcher, 50, an assistant manager at Walmart, is at the heart of a groundbreaking legal battle with the medical industry over whether he is a criminal or a victim.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a well-rounded, educated individual who thinks that I don\u2019t have an addictive personality. But when you go to the doctor and they\u2019re pushing the drugs, and they feed and feed the addiction,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is it going to take before we as a nation accept that we are the victims for the most part and the doctor, the pharmacist and pharmacies are the perpetrators feeding off the lives of others?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2016/may/25/opioid-epidemic-overdose-deaths-map\">A deadly crisis: mapping the spread of America's drug overdose epidemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hatcher is among 29 survivors of opioid addiction or relatives of those who overdosed on painkillers who accuse doctors, pharmacies and distributors in a rural corner of West Virginia of pushing the powerful and highly addictive drugs, which have properties similar to those of heroin. </p> <p>The lawsuit alleges that \u201ca veritable rogue\u2019s gallery of pill-pushing doctors and pharmacies\u201d grew rich on the back of patients who sought medical treatment only to have their lives wrecked by addiction.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a conspiracy,\u201d said Jim Cagle, the lawyer for Hatcher and other plaintiffs. \u201cDoctors and pharmacies were keeping them hooked. They were feeding the addiction.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the physicians and pharmacists involved have been jailed and stripped of their medical licences while several drug distributors agreed in June to pay West Virginia millions of dollars for flooding the state with opioid pills, contributing to an addiction epidemic and the highest death rate from drug overdoses in the US. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The doctor, the pharmacist and pharmacies are the perpetrators feeding off the lives of others</p> <footer> <cite>Wilbert Hatcher</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The case is expected to go to trial later this year after the West Virginia supreme court rejected a claim by lawyers for the accused doctors, pharmacists and drug stores that former addicts should not be able to sue because they admit abusing drugs. </p> <p>But lawyers for the accused parties maintain that the fault lies with the addicts. They claim that Hatcher and other plaintiffs are criminals who only became hooked because they illegally abused the drugs \u2013 a position backed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who could face a hit to their<strong> </strong>multibillion dollar market. </p> <p>That argument met with derision from one of West Virginia\u2019s US senators, Joe Manchin, who likened attempts to blame the victims for their addiction to the tactics of cigarette manufacturers. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the same argument that the tobacco industry used. They can\u2019t go down that path,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an epidemic because we have a business model for it. Follow the money. Look at the amount of pills they shipped into certain parts of our state. It was a business model.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Rapidly escalating doses</h2> <p>Hatcher received his first opioid prescription after he fell down steps working at a motel in 2003. The state workers\u2019 compensation fund referred him to a busy pain clinic, the Wellness Center in Williamson, a declining coal town of about 3,000 people. </p> <p>The clinic was run day-to-day by Dr William Ryckman, who formerly worked as a physician at a federal prison. Ryckman said in a deposition that he was hired to work in Williamson in 1997 by a prisoner he befriended, Henry Vinson, who served five years for running a gay prostitution ring in Washington DC. Ryckman described the former prisoner as \u201csetting up the practice\u201d and recruiting doctors. Vinson said he did no more than manage the building.</p> <p>Hatcher\u2019s first consultation was with another early recruit to the clinic \u2013 Dr Katherine Hoover. She moved to West Virginia in the midst of a legal battle to keep her medical licence in Florida after she was accused of having asked a 17-year-old patient to have sex with her son.</p> <p>Hatcher said Hoover immediately prescribed him opioids and rapidly increased the dosage. He said he was alert to the dangers because he once counselled drug addicts but he trusted the doctor and assumed he would be safe if he diligently followed the prescription. Yet within six months he was addicted to the opioids.</p> <p>\u201cI had to have that pill every morning to get out of bed, to function. To go without it, the physical pain. Oh gosh. Your hands is jerking. You feel the cramps in your arms and your legs. The anxiety. You\u2019re trying to figure out, what am I going to do here? It\u2019s real bad. I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s the worst time of my life,\u201d he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019re not going to fight the doctor giving them to you when you\u2019re addicted to them</p> <footer> <cite>Wilbert Hatcher</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hatcher said his head told him he needed to get off the drugs and he hoped the doctor would reduce his prescription. Instead, he found that Hoover barely examined him and then stopped bothering to see him at all \u2013 instead leaving prescriptions for him to pick up for cash without a consultation. </p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re taking them, you\u2019re not going to fight the doctor giving them to you when you\u2019re addicted to them. You\u2019re not going say stop giving them to me,\u201d he said. Like many of those hooked on opioids, Hatcher needed ever-increasing doses to satisfy the addiction. Eventually, he looked to the black market to top up his prescriptions. \u201cYou can go out on the streets and get it. I\u2019ve done it. There are people in my life that I would never have associated with. There are people that couldn\u2019t get five minutes of my time because I knew what they were doing. These were drug dealers. But now these people are in my circle because they have the pills I need,\u201d he said. \u201cYou knew who had them. This is my town. This is where I grew up. You knew who they were.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/25/opioid-epidemic-prescription-painkillers-heroin-addiction\">How cracking down on America's painkiller capital led to a heroin crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The drugs took over much of his life. They were costing him large amounts of money but also time with his children because he would spend hours waiting for dealers. His answer was to quit a well-paying but demanding position as assistant manager at Walmart and take a $10-an-hour job in an auto parts store.</p> <p>Hatcher weaned himself off the drugs with the help of counseling in 2013. He got his job back at Walmart but regards those years as a lost decade.</p> <p>\u201cI could have been the store manager by now. But when your mind is not functioning correctly, you\u2019re not thinking clearly, you lose that opportunity,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Lawyers for the doctors, pharmacies and pain clinics named in the legal action claim that Hatcher\u2019s addiction was his own fault. They say he and other addicts abused the drugs by buying some illegally, grinding them up to get a more powerful high or \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d in search of several prescriptions at once. </p> <p>\u201cThe very core of (their) alleged claims stem from their own criminal, illegal and immoral activity,\u201d the defendants said in court papers.</p> <p>Cagle does not deny that some, but not all, of his clients misused drugs before their opioid addiction. But he said that neither justifies prescribing them opioids for years on end nor the circumstances of other plaintiffs who never touched illegal drugs and only became hooked on painkillers after seeking treatment for work injuries or car accidents.</p> <p>Cagle contends that the doctors and pharmacists knew just how addictive the drugs were but kept on prescribing and dispensing them in large quantities because they were making big profits. Hatcher says the claim he became an addict because he abused drugs is back to front. He and others say they became addicted while following the prescriptions and only once they were hooked did they abuse drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s a circle. You go to the doctor and they bill you. The pharmacy, they\u2019re a part of it because they were giving out a whole bunch of pills. It\u2019s business,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is spit town. How many pills were they selling? Enough for a major city. This is ridiculous.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018No medicine was practiced at her office\u2019</h2> <p>The Wellness Center, later renamed Mountain Medical Care, was shut down after a federal raid in 2010. Federal prosecutors who convicted some doctors and an administrator at the clinic described it as a moneymaking machine, raking in more $4.5m a year as word spread beyond Williamson that opioid prescriptions could be had with ease. In legal papers to seize Hoover\u2019s assets, federal officials said she prescribed more pain medication than any other doctor in West Virginia during the 2000s.</p> <p>Among her other patients was Willis Duncan, who worked as an electrician in coal mines for more than 30 years until he was referred to the clinic after he suffered a crushed sternum and broken ribs in a work accident.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d get to the clinic at five o\u2019clock in the morning. They didn\u2019t open till eight o\u2019clock, but at five o\u2019clock there would be a hundred people there waiting,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could tell them your dick hurts and they would write you a script. The doctor\u2019s signature was already on it when you went in.\u201d</p> <p>Federal investigators said the doctors frequently did not even see the patients they were writing prescriptions for. Hatcher and Duncan both noticed that after handing over cash they picked up prescriptions signed by a Dr William Ryckman, who had never examined them. Ryckman, one of Vinson\u2019s first hires, lived nearly 300 miles from the clinic in Pennsylvania and was later convicted of sending blank prescriptions to the clinic which assistants filled in with patients\u2019 details. He was jailed for six months and lost his medical licence. The authorities also found a bank account with Ryckman\u2019s name on it and more than $1m in cash deposits but he denied knowledge of it. </p> <p>Another Williamson doctor, Diane Shafer, who Ryckman said in his deposition was married to Vinson, at one time wrote more painkiller prescriptions than some hospitals in West Virginia.</p> <p>\u201cShafer simply handed out prescriptions in exchange for cash, even pre-signing scripts for patient files,\u201d said the lawsuit against her for allegedly contributing to the death of a patient. \u201cNo medicine was practiced at her office.\u201d</p> <p>Shafer was arrested, admitted to illegally prescribing opioids and was sentenced to six months in federal prison. She has been barred from practicing medicine after surrendering her licence. </p> <p>Hatcher, Duncan and the other plaintiffs contend that the doctors were only part of the problem. They allege the pain clinics were working in league with drug stores, which also made large profits from selling the opioids. The lawsuit calls them \u201camong the most grossly negligent pharmacies in America\u201d.</p> <p>One was a small stone building on Williamson\u2019s main street, Tug Valley Pharmacy, which became notorious in the town for the long lines of out of state cars at its drive-through window. Its owner, Randy Ballengee, said in a deposition that he filled up to 200 prescriptions a day from the Wellness Clinic but did not know that it was widely spoken of locally as a \u201cpill mill\u201d. Witnesses testified that drug deals were openly made outside the pharmacy and that prescriptions were refilled early for cash. </p> <p>Hatcher used another pharmacy in the neighbouring town of South Williamson, just across the border in Kentucky. Its owner, Larry Ray Barnett, who has since died, also claimed in a deposition not to know about the pain clinic\u2019s reputation. But federal authorities said both pharmacies made large profits off of opioids. Duncan was earning $2,500 a week working in the mines but estimates he was spending close to a $1,000 on pills.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They all worked together. The doctors. The pharmacies. They didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s fuck</p> <footer> <cite>Wilbert Hatcher</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThese people messed a lot of people up. Me being a dumbass hillbilly, I didn\u2019t understand what was going on. I didn\u2019t think that they would hurt you and make you keep wanting and wanting,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all worked together. The doctors. The pharmacies. They didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s fuck. If you paid cash, you get your stuff. There was never no doctor who said we want to cut you on this one, cut you on that. More, more, more, more, more, more, more. Just kept increasing.\u201d<br></p> <p>Hatcher said he believed doctors and pharmacists got away with it for years because people in the state have been \u201cstereotyped for years as barefoot, toothless and inbred hillbillies to now welfare drug abusers\u201d.</p> <p>He said the exploitation was perpetuated by the stigma around drug addiction.</p> <p>\u201cPeople that are affected by this treat it just as sexual abuse once was treated, as the public has made it to be something that is shameful and dirty,\u201d he said.</p> <p> </p> <h2>\u2018Handing out drugs like candy\u2019</h2> <p>By the time the Wellness Center was shut down in 2010, Henry Vinson had been in and out of prison for a second time after pleading guilty to aiding and abetting one of the clinic\u2019s doctors, Armando Acosta, in evading taxes by keeping patients\u2019 payments off the books. Vinson today denies he did anything of the sort but said he pleaded guilty to protect his mother because a \u201cmalicious\u201d federal government threatened to indict her too. Vinson\u2019s mother, Joyce Vinson, owned the building with the clinic until she died in 2006 and Henry inherited it. Four years later he agreed to relinquish the $1m property to the government in return for a guarantee that he would not be prosecuted for whatever criminal activities may have taken place at the Wellness Center.</p> <p>Today, Vinson denies having any direct role in setting up or running the clinic. \u201cI have never been in the clinic business. I have never been in that practice. I would think it\u2019s a doctor\u2019s responsibility to see patients and if there\u2019s a patient care issue, I would think that\u2019s between the physician and a patient,\u201d he said. </p> <p> Hoover left the US for the Bahamas. Federal authorities seized her assets and she was stripped of her medical licence over the allegations she pressured a patient to have sex with her son. Hoover has defended the prescriptions as legitimate. </p> <p>A similar pattern played out across West Virginia. By the 2000s, the Sav-Rite pharmacy in Kermit, a town half an hour\u2019s drive north of Williamson with a population of little more than 300, was among the top 25 dispensers of hydrocodone opioid pain medication in the entire country. Federal investigators later accused the pharmacist, James Wooley, of working in concert with the owner of a local medical centre, Debra Justice. The pair allegedly \u201chatched a get rich(er) quick scheme to open a pain clinic that would refer all of its prescriptions for controlled substances to Sav-Rite Kermit\u201d. Investigators said the clinic and pharmacy were \u201chanding out drugs like candy\u201d.</p> <p>At its peak, Sav-Rite was selling more than 3m dosages of hydrocodone a year, earning $6.5m, in an impoverished town of a few hundred people. Investigators said there was so much cash receptionists had difficulty closing the till.</p> <p>Key to the success of the scheme was to find doctors prepared to cooperate. One of them was Dr Donald Kiser. Among the prescriptions he wrote was one for $500 worth of opioids and valium for William Preece, a former coal miner who had been injured in a work accident. </p> <p>Preece overdosed on the drugs the next day. It came just two weeks after Preece had received an earlier prescription for opioids originally prescribed for an injury as a coal miner after he was caught in a rock fall. </p> <p>Preece\u2019s sister, Debbie, said he fought hard to shake the addiction, including attending a methadone clinic. But he kept returning to the pills and the pain clinic kept giving him prescriptions. \u201cI get emotional about it because I can\u2019t get over it,\u201d she said, her voice breaking. \u201cAfter he was not able to work in the mines, he opened a little store for a living. Then he ended up losing his home, his store, everything he had due to the addiction ... Wooley\u2019s clinic, the Sav-Rite, was a like a circus. They even handed out popcorn to people waiting in line. You would see licence plates from everywhere. Virginia. Ohio. Tennessee. Kentucky.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95a4b29663f78006c3e4119c3a78eb121013bdd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95a4b29663f78006c3e4119c3a78eb121013bdd7/0_175_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Debbie Preece remembers her brother: \u2018I get emotional about it because I can\u2019t get over it.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debbie Preece remembers her brother: \u2018I get emotional about it because I can\u2019t get over it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McGreal/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kiser was sent to prison for seven years for violations of federal drug laws and lost his medical licence. Prosecutors said the doctor earned $4,000 a day churning out prescriptions and on occasion exchanged drugs for sex. The judge in the case called Kiser a \u201cdanger to the community\u201d. In 2012, Wooley pleaded guilty to illegally selling prescription medication and conspiracy, and was sentenced to six months in prison.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is this whole chain of manufacturers, doctors, distributors, wholesalers</p> <footer> <cite>Francis Hughes, the state\u2019s former chief deputy attorney general</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The West Virginia authorities say none of this would have been possible if it had not been for distribution companies pouring drugs into the state. The attorney general\u2019s office has sued a dozen firms which between them delivered more than 200m opioid pills to West Virginia in the five years to 2012.

  "<p>Over the 11 years that Angela Merkel has been at the top of German politics, steering her country through global financial crashes, European debt crises and the aftershocks of wars in the Middle East, she has been able to rely on one constant: the loyalty of her party.

We need to send some strong signals about what is acceptable and what isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cThe German people want to help refugees, but they want to help in an orderly way.\u201d</p> <p>Only 36 and openly gay, Spahn may not seem the most likely candidate to lead a conservative rebellion within Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union. \u201cA political path like mine would certainly have been rockier 10 years ago,\u201d he admitted. When he first ran as a candidate in the deeply Catholic M\u00fcnsterland region, some in his party ran a smear campaign to stop him. \u201cObviously, it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e7b6bc52e1008108b606d9574ada34c4bae381b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7b6bc52e1008108b606d9574ada34c4bae381b4/0_271_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Syrian refugee with a picture of Merkel after reaching Munich in September 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Syrian refugee with a picture of Merkel after reaching Munich in September 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But he rejects the idea that his lifestyle runs counter to his politics. \u201cI don\u2019t see the contradiction. Germany\u2019s dominant culture and lifestyle has become a lot more liberal in the last 10 years, whether you are looking at gays and lesbians or at immigration. But my biggest fear is that this new openness is under pressure \u2013 from a very conservative form of Islam and a rightwing backlash against immigration \u2013 and that we will have to fight very hard to preserve it.\u201d When criticising cultural norms in the Arabic world, he deliberately uses the word <em>spiessig</em>, meaning prissy or narrow-minded \u2013 a term in the past often associated with his own party.</p> <p>With a combativeness that can border on arrogance, Spahn first gained a profile as the CDU\u2019s health policy spokesman, repeatedly calling for reforms of the pension system and data protection regulation \u2013 usually two holy cows in German political debate. Having looked like a shoo-in for a ministerial post, Spahn was parked in a junior role in the finance ministry after the 2013 federal election \u2013 a move that some read as a slapdown for the uppity young politician. But in his current role, reporting to influential veteran finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Spahn has been granted a licence to roam across the political field, holding forth on anything from dual citizenship to raising the pension age.</p> <p>Coming from a party that has never openly rebelled against its leader, Spahn is still careful in phrasing criticism of the government. He insisted that he hoped Merkel would run again at the federal elections in 2017 and vehemently rejected the notion that Germany made a \u201cmistake\u201d at the height of the refugee crisis: \u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/15/angela-merkel-defends-germanys-handling-of-refugee-influx\" title=\"\">decision of 4 September</a> was correct and logical,\u201d he says. The \u201cbut\u201d is not long in the coming. \u201cBut we should have been quicker to make clear that it was an exceptional situation.</p> <p>\u201cWe all underestimated the power of how mobile phones and social media could change migration movements \u2026 It is certainly not false that no one in Germany had predicted the extent to which other countries were not prepared to help with the refugee crisis.\u201d</p> <p>But his demands on the party leader are unequivocal. \u201cIt is very important that the German government makes it clear that we have won back control since September and October last year, when we had clearly lost control of the situation due to irregular immigration on the Greek-Turkish border,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very important that we make clear we are aware of the vast challenge of integration. Integration is not just a matter of a two-week language course.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0e9f8e304496f4a474cc201b2ba1ec2840e7a44a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e9f8e304496f4a474cc201b2ba1ec2840e7a44a/0_146_4051_2431/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Merkel in Prague during a visit to the Czech Republic: \u2018It\u2019s very important that we make clear we are aware of the vast challenge of integration,\u2019 said Jens Spahn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Merkel in Prague during a visit to the Czech Republic: \u2018It\u2019s very important that we make clear we are aware of the vast challenge of integration,\u2019 said Jens Spahn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matej Divizna/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the consequences of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, by contrast, Spahn sounds more doveish than others in his party, or even in the finance ministry. While he said there was \u201cnothing I regret more than Britain leaving the European Union\u201d, he criticised politicians \u201cputting the boot into Britain\u201d. Instead, he said, \u201cwe should ask what drove so many people to say: \u2018That European Union is not my own.\u2019 That\u2019s the debate we should be having in Germany, too: does Germany want to be part of a European Union that a majority of Brits don\u2019t feel belongs to them?\u201d</p> <p>In words that will be received with interest in the offices of the British \u201cBrexit ministers\u201d, David Davis and Liam Fox, Spahn appeared supportive of the idea of Britain leaving the single market and instead negotiating a bespoke, \u201cCanada-style\u201d trade deal with the EU. \u201cYou can\u2019t have the one-for-one rules of the single market without free movement. And if you want to have the single market, why leave in the first place? Because in that case you would have to subscribe to the very same rules that are being decided in Brussels without having a say. You may want that, but it wouldn\u2019t make much sense.</p> <p>\u201cBoth sides, and especially Germany, have a great interest in strong economic ties. If you can have a free trade agreement with the US, with Canada, and even with communistic Vietnam, then we\u2019ll get a sensible trade agreement with Great Britain if the will is there.\u201d</p> <p>Spahn dismissed the EU\u2019s delays in ratifying a free-trade deal with America and Canada as uniquely German reservations rooted in anti-American prejudice. Striking a deal with Britain, he said, would be easier to communicate politically. \u201cMost Germans have a positive image of Britain, and I don\u2019t think the majority of Germans are against free trade, per se.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, Spahn said it should be up to the EU to negotiate such a deal. \u201cIf you say the European Union is responsible for free-trade deals, which it is, and the European parliament has got democratic legitimacy too, then it would be up to the EU to negotiate such a deal with Great Britain. But before we start talking about how we can start to couple again, we need to talk about the decoupling first.\u201d</p> <h2>RISE OF JENS SPAHN</h2> <p>16 May 1980 Born in Ahaus near M\u00fcnster, then in West Germany.</p> <p>1997 Became a member of the Christian Democratic Union.</p> <p>2002 Elected to parliament for the constituency of Steinfurt and Borken in North Rhine-Westphalia.</p> <p>2003-08 Studied political science and law at the university of Hagen, graduating with a master\u2019s degree.</p> <p>2012 His homosexuality made public in an article in the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung.</p> <p>2015 Appointed deputy minister in the finance ministry.</p>",

And yet, among the traditional battleground states, Iowa has become perhaps Trump\u2019s best hope of a win. While <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">national polls</a> show the Republican far behind his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ia/iowa_trump_vs_clinton-5597.html\">recent Iowa polls</a> have the candidates neck and neck.<br></p> <p>Trump\u2019s strong position is in part due to the fact that unlike in other swing states, the Iowan Republican establishment has rallied conclusively behind him. </p> <p>On Saturday at the Roast and Ride, a fundraiser featuring pork sandwiches and motorcycles held on behalf of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/03/joni-ernst-pig-castrator-iowa-win-senate-republicans\">the freshman senator Joni Ernst</a>, every major Iowa Republican was present. All three US representatives and both senators rallied behind Trump.

The governor has long been an enthusiastic supporter and has stumped the state on thebusinessman\u2019s behalf. Furthermore, Trump\u2019s Iowa campaign director is Branstad\u2019s son, Eric, a veteran operative who during the caucuses led a bipartisan advocacy campaign on behalf of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/10/iowa-caucus-corn-ethanol-republicans-democrats-ted-cruz\">the renewable fuels industry</a>. In Iowa at least, as election day approaches, Trump can count on the party machinery going into fully into gear.</p> <p>This is not to say Iowa Republicans are unfamiliar with intra-party conflict, and a vocal \u201cNever Trump\u201d contingent is to be found among those who supported Ted Cruz, the victor of the caucuses. But it receives no establishment support. Even congressmen in swing districts are happy to appear with Trump.</p> <p>In contrast, Democrats are off the pace they set in the past two election cycles, regarding organizational goals like absentee ballot requests and thanks to lingering bad blood from the caucuses, when many supporters of Bernie Sanders felt the state party chair, Andy McGuire, tilted the scales on Clinton\u2019s behalf.

Ninety-one per cent white, it was one of a handful of states where Barack Obama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2012/nov/07/obama-reelection-senate-democrats-live\">won a majority of white voters four years ago</a>. But many of the blue-collar white voters who have traditionally voted Democratic in the eastern part of the state are increasingly attracted to Trump. </p> <p>In fading factory towns like Dubuque and Waterloo, long bastions of Democratic support, Trump\u2019s anti-free trade and anti-immigration message is increasingly finding an audience. </p> <p>In the suburbs of Des Moines and Cedar Rapids, meanwhile, he is not losing many moderate Republicans \u2013 mostly because such areas are home to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/09/iowa-senator-ted-cruz-republican-presidential-caucus\">significant numbers of evangelical Christians</a>, to whom Clinton is simply anathema. If such voters do not vote for a third party candidate or stay home, Trump will be their man.</p> <p>New Trump supporters have, however, presented new challenges. Traditionally, Republican operatives scorn Democratic campaigns, which tend to be based on hiring hundreds of staffers to go door to door, getting marginal voters to sign up for absentee ballot requests. Republican voters have been far more consistent, meaning the party\u2019s campaigns have instead focused on tapping into networks of social conservatives, in particular home-schoolers. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/28/donald-trump-comments-death-nba-dwyane-wade-cousin-political-speech-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xt4d\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2690131\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump comments on death of Dwyane Wade's cousin \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c2a9eee4b0655f72768734\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/28/160828TrumpWade_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572764&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572764&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/28/donald-trump-comments-death-nba-dwyane-wade-cousin-political-speech-video\">Donald Trump comments on death of Dwyane Wade\u2019s cousin \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Now, with social conservatives less enthusiastic about Trump than other Republicans, the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts in Iowa must become non-traditional \u2013 in effect, Democratic-style efforts meant to turn out former Democrats. </p> <p>This shift has been buoyed by what Kauffman, the Republican Iowa state chair, sees as a \u201cresurgence of rural populism\u201d. Iowa has a long and bipartisan history of rabble-rousing, going back to the 1890s. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, farmers held dramatic strikes and even kidnapped a judge who presided over foreclosures. In parts of the state, martial law was declared. That tradition had receded, but Kaufmann has seen Trump hauling it back to the surface.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/republican-donors-trump-congress-local-races-sheldon-adelson\">Turned off by Trump: Republican mega-donors focus on congressional races</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Republican gains are borne out in registration figures. Since November 2012, Democratic voter registration in Iowa has fallen by 15,000. In the same time, Republicans have picked up almost 20,000 voters. This effort has been helped by two strong midterm results, eradicating the Democratic bench and leaving the party holding only one of the state\u2019s four congressional seats.</p> <p>In the shifting political math of 2016, all this makes Iowa far more winnable for Trump than many traditionally more competitive states. Accordingly, his campaign has committed significant resources. It is expected that Trump will campaign in the state three or four times a month until election day. Saturday\u2019s Roast and Ride was a taster.</p> <p>Even if this is not enough, and Trump loses Iowa, the coalition he has built may point to a long-term shift which will make the state less purple and more red. As Kaufmann said, win or lose: \u201cI think we have the ingredients for a realignment.\u201d</p> <p>That was a statement with which one well-connected Democrat agreed, though he did not want to attach his name to such an opinion. As he said mournfully this weekend: \u201cIncreasingly, it seems like it is a Republican state and they just let Democrats live here.\u201d</p>",

The future president and first lady visited an art gallery, watched Spike Lee\u2019s Do the Right Thing at the cinema, and talked and talked. Their meeting of minds is recounted in a movie, <a href=\"http://southsidewithyou.com/\">Southside with You</a>, which opened on Friday to mixed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/25/southside-with-you-review-obamas-first-date-is-before-sunset-sans-subtlety\">reviews</a>.</p> <p>The flattering portrait was released to 813 cinemas in North America, far more than first planned, after positive reaction at the Sundance film festival in January. Opinion polls showing the president\u2019s approval rating well above 50% will also have done no harm. \u201cMr Obama hasn\u2019t even left office, but the cinematic hagiography has begun,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/movies/southside-with-you-review.html\">the New York Times commented</a>.</p> <p>Written and directed by 31-year-old Richard Tanne, Southside with You stars Parker Sawyers as Barack and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/movies/tika-sumpter-southside-with-you-michelle-obama.html\">Tika Sumpter</a> as Michelle; the executive producer is the musician and Obama fan John Legend. It meanders through a series of conversations \u2013 reminiscent of Richard Linklater\u2019s Before Sunrise \u2013 against the backdrop of southside Chicago in the late 1980s. At one point, the ambitious young lawyers walk past a wall bearing the name of people killed on the city streets.</p> <p>The movie <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/17/how-true-is-southside-with-you-fact-checking-barack-and-michelle-obama-s-romantic-first-date.html\">sticks mostly to the facts</a>, although a community meeting in a church, where Obama displays his rare talent for oratory, is incorporated from a later date. Michelle, 26, asks 28-year-old Barack if he has dated white women. Tanne has said he doesn\u2019t know if this happened but imagines it probably did at some point. Valerie Jarrett, who in real life had dinner with the couple early in their relationship and is now a senior adviser to the president, does not appear.</p> <p>Some critics have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/barack-obama-takes-michelle-robinson-on-a-first-date-in-southside-with-you/2016/08/24/f2fe0544-6874-11e6-8225-fbb8a6fc65bc_story.html\">praised the film</a> and others have been lukewarm. Obama\u2019s conservative foes are likely to dismiss the film as propaganda. It comes at a wistful moment for the president\u2019s admirers, as he enters the final stretch, his speeches sometimes punctuated by audience cries of \u201cI love you!\u201d and \u201cfour more years!\u201d </p> <p>The contrast with his predecessor, George W Bush \u2013 whose final year in the White House was greeted by Oliver Stone\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/04/oliver.stone.george.bush\">scathing biopic, W</a> \u2013 could not be starker. Where Obama gets a gentle romantic comedy, Bush was seen boozing, going to war on a flimsy premise and threatening the family legacy. </p> <p>\u201cAt the end of the Obama years, we get a glorification,\u201d said Joshua Kendall, a presidential historian. \u201cAt the end of the Bush years, we get a denigration.\u201d</p> <p>Obama\u2019s reputation appears to have grown in inverse proportion to his potential successors, with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump enduring record disapproval ratings. Obama is campaigning for Clinton; Bush took a back seat during John McCain\u2019s 2008 run for the White House.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"654c87b51be378c6b9e80c3aea2854449b793efd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/654c87b51be378c6b9e80c3aea2854449b793efd/0_62_3610_2166/1000.jpg\" alt=\"obama on white house lawn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Obama is seen as a solid person.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zach Gibson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kendall added: \u201cIt\u2019s a moment where the election is a downer on both sides, with all the darkness, and Obama is seen as a solid person. History will be kind to him. The film is going there, and is maybe a little too glowing, but it\u2019s generally right. People [think] there\u2019s an honesty and integrity about him.\u201d</p> <p>Southside with You is only the first cinematic valentine to Obama. Another film is imminent: <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5477566/\">Barry</a>, about his time as a student in New York. Should America\u2019s first black president write another memoir, a screen adaptation might be expected to follow.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem with biography in general is it tends to be hagiography or denigration, in movies even more than books,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cIn general, people don\u2019t tend to want to take in the complexity.\u201d</p> <p>Obama is far from the first president to be lionised \u2013 or demonised \u2013 by Hollywood. Abraham Lincoln\u2019s reputation was burnished by John Ford\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/films/766-young-mr-lincoln\">Young Mr Lincoln</a> in 1939 and Steven Spielberg\u2019s Lincoln in 2012. Richard Nixon suffered a similar fate to Bush when he was played by Anthony Hopkins in Nixon, also directed by Stone, in 1995.</p> <p>The British writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/sep/17/theatre\">Peter Morgan</a>, the author of political dramas including The Deal, The Queen, Frost/Nixon, The Special Relationship and The Audience, said: \u201cIn the US, when they talk about the president, they also talk about the head of state. I think they tend to portray their presidents heroically or as villains.\u201d<br></p> <p>Morgan has not yet seen Southside with You but suggested that, in general, it was wise to let the dust settle before turning political lives into art. </p> <p>\u201cI thought W was done far too quickly. I\u2019m normally an admirer of Oliver Stone, but it was rushed out. I think the rule of thumb is to wait for 10 years. If you wait, then you have the possibility of something having a metaphorical aspect and being about more than itself.\u201d</p> <p>Recalling his own foray into depicting Nixon in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/23/frost-nixon-film-review\">a stage play and film</a> about the former president\u2019s landmark TV interviews with the British broadcaster David Frost, Morgan said: \u201cIn America, it was a play about Richard Nixon. In Britain, it was a play about David Frost. </p> <p>\u201cI had a particularly terrifying screening in Washington where all the old Watergate bounty hunters came to watch. Nixon was a very American tragedy which no Englishman could claim to own.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/24/lincoln-review\">Lincoln \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are signs in recent years that Hollywood is finding new ways to explore the White House. Franklin D Roosevelt, another president who might be expected to receive heroic treatment, was instead portrayed having an affair with his cousin in 2012\u2019s Hyde Park on Hudson, starring Bill Murray and Laura Linney. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/14/the-butler-review\">Lee Daniels\u2019 The Butler</a> saw presidents come and go through the eyes of a black butler played by Forest Whitaker.</p> <p>When he was played by Kevin Spacey opposite Michael Shannon in Elvis &amp; Nixon earlier this year, for once Watergate was not the focus of a film about the 37th president. A recent HBO adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/08/robert-schenkkan-lyndon-b-johnson-all-the-way-bryan-cranston\">Robert Schenkkan\u2019s play All the Way</a> presented Bryan Cranston\u2019s richly nuanced depiction of Lyndon Johnson as both angel and ape. Coming soon at the Venice film festival is the premiere of Jackie, featuring Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy in the aftermath of her husband\u2019s assassination in 1963.</p> <p>Not every politician, however, reads and watches coverage of themselves as assiduously as Trump does. Asked if Obama had seen Southside with You, White House <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/08/25/press-briefing-press-secretary-josh-earnest-8252016\">press secretary Josh Earnest replied</a>: \u201cI have not talked to him about the film and I don\u2019t know whether or not he\u2019s seen it. But I\u2019ll see if we can get you some information about that.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There are no pirates in Penzance, but there is David, on loan from London. None of us are quite sure what David does; he used to be the lead singer in a band called Tribal Nation; now he lives on Berkeley Square in the capital. He spends 18 weeks of the year in the south of France and four weeks visiting Cornwall\u2019s newest tourist hotspot, Penzance.</p> <p>Tonight David is serving the dinner at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jul/04/chapel-house-penzance-cornwall-hotel-review\">Chapel House</a>, a boutique hotel within an impressive Georgian building that was formerly a bohemian arts club. Two years ago he was here stripping wallpaper over a chilly new year with owner Susan, a long-time friend who moved to the south-western tip of the country from London with the dream of renovating and running an upmarket B&amp;B. Now it\u2019s the start of a hot summer and places at Susan\u2019s weekly dinner are booked up. David makes himself useful, dishing up local turbot to the communal table and pouring wine while Susan puts her saffron bread-and-butter pudding in the oven. Afterwards, the pair join the guests for more wine and animated conversation \u2013 there\u2019s a reason this home-from-home has been voted the country\u2019s best B&amp;B, and word is spreading (this week\u2019s punters are British, German and Austrian).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcf20723976c28cf549bada4ed2526e44b502312\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcf20723976c28cf549bada4ed2526e44b502312/0_194_5760_3455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Voted the country\u2019s best B&B: Chapel House, Penzance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Voted the country\u2019s best B&amp;B: Chapel House, Penzance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Penzance has become good at attracting outsiders. In fact, in recent years it has been experiencing something of a transformation. First, a string of sophisticated new lodgings opened: across the road, Artist\u2019s Residence, a design hotel with outposts in London and Brighton, attracts a younger crowd with an eye for eclectic interiors. Then came the restaurants: <a href=\"http://theshorerestaurant.uk/\">The Shore</a>, run by Rick Stein alumnus Bruce Rennie, and the <a href=\"http://tolcarneinn.co.uk/\">Tolcarne Inn</a>, an authentic Cornish pub with food by Michelin-starred chef Ben Tunnicliffe. And that\u2019s without mentioning the \u201c<em>Poldark</em> effect\u201d. Since the BBC reincarnated its popular 1970s drama series last year, Cornwall has seen a 155% increase in visitors. Penzance, along with the ever popular St Ives, has become a base to explore <em>Poldark</em> country at its best.</p> <p>With a baby on the way, my husband and I have come back to the area where we both holidayed as toddlers \u2013 call it our final infant-free escape or a foolish preview of the staycations that lie ahead. The first day, filled with glorious weather, seems cut out for the <em>Poldark</em> trek, so we make our first stop Porthgwarra, the cove where actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/06/bbc-poldark-series-three-aidan-turner\">Aidan Turner</a> took a semi-naked dip in the sea in the first series. In his honour, we sit at the tiny cafe on top of the cliff, decimating a large cream tea.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We spot a seal basking on the rocks in the almost turquoise waters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It fuels us for the walk to Porthcurno, an easy hike along the coastal path. In early summer sun, the beaches here could pass for the Caribbean, so it\u2019s hard not to feel smug. As we reach over the headland we spot a seal basking on the rocks in the almost turquoise waters. That afternoon we head up to the <a href=\"https://www.minack.com/\">Minack open-air theatre</a>, on top of the cliff \u2013 there are productions here come rain or shine but it\u2019s worth buying a day ticket (\u00a34.50) just for the views.</p> <p>Afterwards, it\u2019s a short drive to Levant Mine, the Unesco world heritage site that poses as <em>Poldark</em>\u2019s<em> </em>fictional Tresiders Rolling Mill. We emerge from the depths where Cornish miners extracted copper by candlelight in time for a stroll along the coast at sunset.</p> <p>Back in Penzance that night, Susan recommends some pubs in the area. We go to the Admiral Benbow, filled with tacky maritime treasures, followed by the Turks Head, a whitewashed 13th century inn with an underground tunnel once used to smuggle pirates\u2019 bounty. Both are on Chapel Street, home to a rundown Chinese, ramshackle antique shops and the Exchange, a contemporary arts space with glass running the length of its facade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eea4f57d6b3ec2e0e670f388c66d0a61108437e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eea4f57d6b3ec2e0e670f388c66d0a61108437e1/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thrice as nice: the triangular Jubilee Pool lido in Penzance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thrice as nice: the triangular Jubilee Pool lido in Penzance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next morning we head down to the harbour and soon find ourselves at Jubilee Pool, the town\u2019s triangular art deco lido on the rocks. This large seawater pool took a battering in 2014\u2019s winter storms and reopened after a \u00a33 million restoration \u2013 today it\u2019s filled with regulars, including a group of women who meet here for stand-up paddleboarding but spend most of their time laughing and falling in.</p> <p>Over the coming days there\u2019s much more to do: watch the surfers at Sennen, wade out to St Michael\u2019s Mount and sample Newlyn crab and other delicious food. It\u2019s hard to rival the Tolcarne Inn, where pints of lager and packets of crisps are served at the bar alongside impeccable fish dishes (we choose monkfish with tomato fondue and grey mullet with orange beetroot). There are more baby-free nights of luxury at <a href=\"http://artistresidencecornwall.co.uk/\">Artist Residence</a>, where my husband drains pints in the beer garden, plus an impromptu meal at the Honey Pot, where we enquire after the homity pie.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s delicious, is what homity pie is,\u201d is all the Cornish waitress will say, before disappearing to tend to a mother and daughter who have dropped in on their way home from school.

  "<p>Donal Ryan\u2019s third novel is a departure for him. With his previous two books he cruised along easy street with tales of woe and tragedy that picked up praise and rewards on the way, their unlikely heroes plucking at our heart strings. Here, with his female antihero Melody Shee, Ryan turns his back on the formula and veers off-road. Expect a bumpy ride.</p> <p>Melody is 33 and has just informed her husband \u2013 who \u201c13 and a bit&#xa0;weeks ago was the only boy I\u2019d ever&#xa0;kissed\u201d \u2013 that her unborn child is&#xa0;not his. A 17-year-old Traveller named Martin Toppy, whom she taught&#xa0;for more than a year, is the father.</p> <p>Our protagonist is a horrible person who has been in a toxic, destructive relationship for too long. On discovering her husband has been using prostitutes, she secretly delights in the news so she can \u201cfashion a scalpel from [it] to silently flay him\u201d. It\u2019s refreshing to find a repulsive protagonist in a novel&#xa0;by one of Ireland\u2019s most successful contemporary writers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is the flashbacks to Melody\u2019s relationship with Martin that gives the book much of its colour</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Melody is an educated woman who has written poetry for the local newspaper (this would explain her poetic descriptions and keen observations of the weather and people). She has also written articles on assistance for asylum seekers and abortion.</p> <p>However, this is all exposition. In the&#xa0;narrating of her life, we get no sense she has an opinion on abortion other than one fleeting mention of London (a euphemism for abortion in&#xa0;Ireland) while she considers what&#xa0;to&#xa0;do with her pregnancy. Nor do we get a&#xa0;sense of her feelings about&#xa0;class issues or discrimination against Travellers other than correcting her father and husband for&#xa0;using derogatory terms. The reader is left on the surface of her psychological landscape, unable to delve into what should be a really interesting character.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/05/thing-about-december-donal-ryan-review\">The Thing About December by Donal Ryan \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Refreshingly, Melody refuses to be a victim like the many narrators of Ryan\u2019s other novels. But as if to offset this denial of easy sympathy, every other character becomes weak and needy. Within the opening 40-odd pages, everyone (other than Melody) cries: Melody\u2019s husband on hearing about the pregnancy, Martin Toppy when he first arrives to be tutored, Melody\u2019s father at the kitchen table, her childhood friend, Breedie, and a young Traveller woman, Mary. It is unrelenting.</p> <p>To his credit, Ryan does attempt to give voice to the Traveller community. The two teenage Travellers in the novel are illiterate, though 19-year-old Mary has the \u201ctaste of a vision\u201d and is something of a mystic. Martin\u2019s father is a famous bare-knuckle boxer and Martin himself will follow suit. Here, the novel follows a well-worn path of violence between Travellers, with shootings, knee-cappings, slashings, family feuds (even a mother carries a shotgun) and scores being settled \u201cone on one\u201d. For a writer of Ryan\u2019s obvious talents, it seems like a missed opportunity for an underrepresented community to be portrayed in such a negative, cliched way.</p> <p>It is the flashbacks to Melody\u2019s relationship with Martin that gives the book much of its colour, but the moral consequences of her actions \u2013 seducing a boy of 16 over the course of a year \u2013 could have been examined in more depth.</p> <p>Undoubtedly a departure for Ryan, <em>All We Shall Know </em>is a brave attempt at extending his oeuvre. It might just be an extension too far.</p> <p><em>Kevin Curran\u2019s second novel, Citizens, is out now.

I get up very early every morning, around five or six o\u2019clock, and I always start the day by reading 15 minutes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/13/edouard-glissant-obituary\">Edouard Glissant</a>, a poet, writer and philosopher. I have every book he ever wrote at home and I\u2019ll just pick one and read.</p> <p>For me, Glissant\u2019s work is like a daily toolbox. He comes from Martinique, which is one of a string of islands [making up the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean Sea]. A cultural exchange takes place between these islands and yet they preserve their own identities. So Glissant\u2019s work explores how we can engage with globalisation without falling into the trap of homogenisation. His books are an inspiration, particularly in this current climate of a lack of tolerance. I\u2019m always considering how we could develop exhibitions that embrace mondiality, which don\u2019t lead to separation but to dialogue, which build bridges.</p> <p>After Glissant, I go running, often in the park, because I love London parks. In this city, you can discover new things every day, even after living here for many years. Then it\u2019s breakfast and the office. I read about 30-40 magazines every month: all the art publications through to <em>London Review of Books</em>, the <em>New Yorker</em>, the <em>Economist</em>, <em>Scientific American</em>. In my bag currently I have about 150 articles from the last two weeks; I cut them out and share them with friends. They often trigger something. For example, many years ago I read about a group of 60s architects who had questioned the masterplan, and about Yona Friedman, and this year he has actually built one of our <a href=\"http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/serpentine-summer-houses-2016-yona-friedman\">summer houses at the Serpentine.</a></p> <p>With social media, there are the ones I use for information and the ones I broadcast on. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HUObrist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a> is both. With Facebook, I never really use it actively, just to broadcast my interviews with artists on Facebook Live, or sometimes they\u2019re on <a href=\"https://www.periscope.tv/HUObrist/1BRKjkmnENVGw\">Periscope</a>. Over the last six months, I\u2019ve also increasingly been using Snapchat. I follow some people I find inspiring, but I also broadcast films, little performances by artists, short sparks, short poems.</p> <p>I can\u2019t live without <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hansulrichobrist/?hl=en\">Instagram</a>. I look at it a lot, about half an hour to an hour a day and then post. My handwriting project on Instagram is a protest against the disappearance of handwriting \u2013 I post a handwritten note there every day. But I also find Instagram very inspiring. The diverse ways people use it is exciting \u2013 whether it\u2019s the artist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wolfgang_tillmans/\">Wolfgang Tillmans</a> using it for activism with his anti-Brexit posters, or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jenniferhiggie/?hl=en\">Jennifer Higgie</a> [co-editor of <a href=\"https://frieze.com/editorial\"><em>Frieze</em></a> magazine] who posts about a different extraordinary female artist every day, with a little text of biography so it\u2019s really a protest against forgetting.</p> <p>My absolute favourite account though is from Alice Rawsthorn, the design critic of the international <em>New York Times</em>. She structures her posts by week, so each week there\u2019s a new theme \u2013 \u201cDesign and Light\u201d or \u201cDesign Families\u201d \u2013 and each day there\u2019s a new post related to the theme, so for example, there was a stunning <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BG4Jh-3vPa0/?hl=pt-br\">lighthouse from 1750</a> for \u201cDesign and Light\u201d. In a way, she came up with the rules of the game, to actually structure it by weeks, because most people have it as a daily thing. I\u2019m completely obsessed by her Instagram \u2013 it\u2019s a fascinating vision of design that makes us look at the world differently.</p> <p>I always have my best ideas in Sils Maria, a village in the Swiss mountains. I\u2019m from Switzerland and spent a lot of time there as a child. Now I go about once or twice a year. There\u2019s something very magical about the place, the light \u2013 it\u2019s almost at 2,000 metres altitude \u2013 it\u2019s glacial, it has big mountains. Most of my exhibition and book ideas I\u2019ve had there.</p> <p>My favourite cultural venue is actually an imaginary construct \u2013 it\u2019s the unrealised <a href=\"http://funpalaces.co.uk/about/idea-come/\">Fun Palace</a> by the theatre director Joan Littlewood and the architect Cedric Price, who in the 60s came up with this idea of a cultural centre bringing together all artistic disciplines, removing all silos. As a thought experiment, I\u2019m inspired by it every day. Unfortunately the Fun Palace was never built, but you can get a sense of Cedric Price\u2019s work by going to his <a href=\"https://www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo/exhibits/snowdon-aviary\">amazing aviary</a> created with Lord Snowdon at London Zoo. It\u2019s my favourite building in London.</p> <p><strong>Favourite TV</strong> I mostly watch on demand, a lot of Netflix. Recently it\u2019s been <em>The People v OJ Simpson</em>. I also like this exercise of looking at all the films that a director has done \u2013 like Tarantino \u2013 going into breadth and depth at the same time.</p> <p><strong>My litmus test for new ideas</strong> I always ask myself: \u201cIs it urgent?\u201d I use that word often. <strong>IC</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85a797942ffa944583fbc04e08925ce5e67e6fe5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85a797942ffa944583fbc04e08925ce5e67e6fe5/0_117_498_299/498.jpg\" alt=\"Fabian Riggall.\" width=\"498\" height=\"299\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Once Upon a Time in America made me fall in love with cinema\u2019: Fabian Riggall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Funnell/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Fabien Riggall: \u2018I have good ideas in the shower, so I get out and get my house wet\u2019</h2> <p><strong>As founder of Secret Cinema, Riggall has transformed how we watch films: since 2007 his live cinematic events have invited costumed fans to explore the immersive world of a movie, from </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nHZAZZqOqM\"><strong><em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest</em></strong></a><strong> to <em>Star Wars</em>. He now plans to expand into the US and produce films.</strong></p> <p>On a good morning, my routine is to get up around 7am and go for a run around Victoria Park, east London, near where I live, or a swim. I feel much more relaxed if I exercise in the morning, but if I\u2019m tired I just don\u2019t do it. I tend to have a lot of good ideas when I\u2019m in the shower, so I get out and get my whole house wet. Then I\u2019ll go and have a coffee in a place called <a href=\"http://www.climpsonandsons.com/\">Climpson &amp; Sons</a> and just have half an hour before the day starts to write to-do lists and notes.</p> <p>The biggest influence on my career has been going to the cinema when I was very young and seeing <em>Once Upon a Time in America</em>, a very violent gangster film from the 80s. I was living in Morocco at the time and I sneaked out to watch it. It\u2019s a very romantic, epic film and it had a profound effect on me. I fell in love with cinema and with the idea of what cinema was.</p> <p>One non-cultural thing that inspires my work is politics. We did a big campaign for Remain through Secret Cinema; for <em>Star Wars</em>,<em> </em>we worked with the <a href=\"https://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/\">Refugee Council</a>; for <em>28 Days Later</em>, we supported the junior doctors; for <em>Dr Strangelove</em>, we worked with <a href=\"https://www.warchild.org.uk/\">War Child</a>. I believe that all art is political by nature and I\u2019m passionate about people getting involved in political matters.</p> <p>This summer, I went to Glastonbury, which I think is one of England\u2019s great cultural achievements: it\u2019s an extraordinary balance between types of culture and I like the madness and chaos of it. Just after the sad news about Brexit I saw Damon Albarn perform with the <a href=\"http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/the-syrian-national-orchestra-95691\">Orchestra of Syrian Musicians</a>; it was about 60 musicians, with all these different singers. That was special.</p> <p><strong>Favourite cafe to work in </strong>I like the simplicity of Le Pain Quotidien: you sit on these long tables and work really easily.</p> <p><strong>Favourite app</strong> I spend most of my life trying to get off social media, but one app I love is <a href=\"https://www.waze.com/\">Waze</a>, a GPS-based navigation app that takes you away from traffic. I use it a lot when I\u2019m travelling. <strong>KB</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ca80fbb0920c49a1a365f4a090853b7b8f5b60e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca80fbb0920c49a1a365f4a090853b7b8f5b60e0/0_197_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maria Balshaw.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A seminal piece of work for me\u2019: Maria Balshaw with Helen Chadwick\u2019s Piss Flowers at Jupiter Artland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Maria Balshaw: \u2018If I feel a bit sick at the thought of an idea, that means it\u2019s a bit exciting\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Director of the Whitworth and Manchester Art Galleries, Balshaw\u2019s dramatic \u00a315m transformation of the Whitworth earned it the prestigious Museum of the Year award in 2015.

When they plop on the doormat I\u2019m always very pleased. In work, it\u2019s more<a href=\"https://frieze.com/\"> <em>Frieze</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.artmonthly.co.uk/\"><em>Art Monthly</em></a>, <a href=\"http://artforum.com/\"><em>Artforum</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.apollo-magazine.com/\"><em>Apollo.</em></a> I dream of different lives by regularly visiting the <a href=\"http://www.themodernhouse.com/\">Modern House</a> website which, if Le Corbusier and associates are of interest to you, is the most heartbreaking website ever. Basically, the Modern House sells post-1940s houses in the UK and they\u2019re not all super-expensive; some of them are beautifully done up ex-council places by Goldfinger or around the Barbican. And I keep saying: \u201cI love that! Look at this 1960s house \u2013 I want to live there!\u201d They recently published a fantastic coffee-table book and they write about the houses beautifully; they\u2019re like museum entries for houses I\u2019d like to live in.</p> <p>Visual pleasure and visual exploration are really important to me, but I\u2019m also a profoundly physical person. I have my best ideas in the 30 minutes following my almost daily yoga session. For me, yoga creates space within the mind as well as realigning the body so that the solutions to whatever I\u2019ve been grappling with in the previous 24 hours or 24 weeks just sort of emerge.</p> <p>One of the litmus tests I have for new ideas is in the body. If I feel a bit sick at the thought of an idea, a bit \u201coooh, God, this is scary\u201d, that actually means it\u2019s a bit exciting, doesn\u2019t it? That feeling in the gut makes me realise that, yes, this is a challenging and therefore sensible thing to do.</p> <p>I walk a lot; I really love walking in the landscape, seeing beautiful things. One of my favourite cultural venues is Jupiter Artland, an outdoor sculpture park about 12 miles outside Edinburgh. It has a really wide range of contemporary sculpture, all commissioned for the site, beautiful woodland and fantastic walks through rolling fields, as well as a lovely house. The artworks include a nine-metre-high shotgun by Cornelia Parker propped up against a very tall tree and a wonderful amethyst grotto by Anya Gallaccio. Installed just beside the cafe are Helen Chadwick\u2019s <em>Piss Flowers </em>\u2013 a kind of garden of Piss Flowers, which I love; they were a seminal piece of work for me when I was younger.</p> <p>In Manchester, in the year since it opened, I\u2019ve been going a lot to <a href=\"http://homemcr.org/\">Home</a>, the multi-artform space in the centre of town. It\u2019s rapidly become a great social space with a diverse crowd, and that\u2019s also true for my teenagers who are 19 and 16; it\u2019s become their space as well. I have lots of breakfast meetings in <a href=\"https://www.figandsparrow.co.uk/\">Fig + Sparrow</a>, a cafe in the northern quarter that also sells really nice Danish homewares. It\u2019s run by two artist-photographers who can\u2019t make a living being artist-photographers so are cafe owners too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jan/25/cornelia-parker-interview-i-dont-want-to-tick-anyone-elses-boxes-whitworth-retrospective\">Cornelia Parker: \u2018I don\u2019t want to tick anyone else\u2019s boxes\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I could happily live without all technology, but I\u2019m not violently opposed to it \u2013 I just don\u2019t like it to take up too much of the time that I have to be in the world myself. Instagram is my favourite social media because it\u2019s the most visual. I\u2019m quite picky about who I follow \u2013 I only follow people who have a very good eye. So one of my favourites is British-Nigerian fashion designer and occasional curator Duro Olowu, who is just fabulous. He could be commenting on something in his professional life or passing through an airport in Lagos and he sees an extraordinarily dressed woman and catches the print and the style.</p> <p>The thing I really couldn\u2019t live without, though, is my camera on my iPhone, because I want to capture the world as I\u2019m going along, the things I need to remember \u2013 and I need visual anchors for them.</p> <p>In the role that I\u2019m in now, a very small number of artists have been sounding boards, touchstones, inspirations, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/marina-abramovic\">Marina Abramovi\u0107</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jun/11/richard-wentworth-sculptor-portrait-artist\">Richard Wentworth</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/cornelia-parker\">Cornelia Parker</a>. For me, the process of working with artists is about exploring the not yet known and that\u2019s why I love my job. But for my whole life my family have been the most incredible anchor. My husband, Nick, who is a work colleague as well, is just so optimistic about possibilities. And there\u2019s nothing better than a toddler\u2019s or a teenager\u2019s view on whatever particularly difficult work problem you\u2019re wrestling with. My daughter, Lily, forged an incredibly close bond with Marina Abramovi\u0107 when she worked with us in Manchester in 2009 and every so often, even now, she\u2019ll say: \u201cYou know if you asked Marina that question she\u2019d say, \u2018Don\u2019t do it\u2019 or she\u2019d tell them to get lost\u201d. But Lily is 16 now so she\u2019d use less polite language than that. In fact, another test for new ideas comes from Marina; she said: \u201cIf you have a lot of ideas and you write them down and think, \u2018Oh I really like that one\u2019, she said, \u2018Throw that idea away, it\u2019s too easy\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>If you only work you lose your capacity to have ideas. So, as I said, I do a lot of physical practice but also gardening. Growing vegetables and things that I have started from seed and that end up on the plate is incredibly important to me. When I was a PhD student, I worked in a remarkable south Indian restaurant in Brighton and I learned how to cook Goan and Keralan food so I particularly like to cook that sort of food, and I live in the curry mile in Manchester so I can get all the ingredients in really big bags. Most of the good projects I\u2019ve worked on have started with a dinner at my house.</p> <p><strong>Unmissable TV</strong> These past couple of months it\u2019s been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/dec/06/legacy-danish-tv-drama-bbc-borgen\"><em>The Legacy</em></a>, a Danish drama with an absolutely monstrous female gallery director. The observations around the art world have been really hilarious. <strong>IC</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d4cff7be3f2b0b9abcd462fae22f00a1afece15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d4cff7be3f2b0b9abcd462fae22f00a1afece15/0_793_4559_2734/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Lan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My iPhone is like my third hand\u2019: David Lan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>David Lan: \u2018My best ideas come when I\u2019m climbing the steps into an aeroplane\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Artistic director of the Young Vic theatre since 2000, South African-born Lan has transformed the venue near London\u2019s South Bank into a multi-award-winning theatrical powerhouse. </strong></p> <p>When I have an idea I ask myself, do I know how to do this? And if the answer is yes, I don\u2019t do it \u2013 we\u2019ve done that, so let\u2019s not bother. The thing that\u2019s energising in making theatre is the unknown: trying to make things, inventing, improvising.</p> <p>I always find I get ideas when I\u2019m about to go somewhere, travelling \u2013 often it\u2019s when I\u2019m climbing up the steps into an aeroplane. But it\u2019s always going. Coming back is different and I don\u2019t have any ideas at all. The other place I have ideas is watching other people\u2019s shows, although it\u2019s usually not obviously connected to what I\u2019m watching. I\u2019ll sit for the rest of the show with my fingers crossed, going: \u201cI know there are two or three things I\u2019ve got to remember\u201d.</p> <p>I do a lot of thinking when I\u2019m swimming, especially in the summer, when I go away for a while and I swim all the time. There\u2019s a great big lake in south-west France, near Carcassonne, where I\u2019ve been swimming for 20 years. I just go round and round, up and down, and there\u2019s almost never anybody else there. I go swimming in London too, but not as much as I\u2019d like to. At the right time of year I go up to the Hampstead ponds, but really you can just splash about.</p> <p>I love watching dance at Sadler\u2019s Wells \u2013 the Israeli choreographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/hofesh-shechter\">Hofesh Shechter</a> or avant-garde choreographers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/oct/07/william.forsythe.dance\">William Forsythe</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/pinabausch\">Pina Bausch</a>. I think her work is a bit patchy; sometimes, it\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ve ever seen and sometimes you can\u2019t wait for it to end. But at its best, it\u2019s fantastically interesting.</p> <p>Somewhere not in London that I like very much is the Amsterdam Toneelgroep. There are two theatres next to each other: one was probably built in the late 18th century, the Stadsschouwburg. It\u2019s a beautiful, big, old, rather baroque theatre with a huge stage; to the side of it is the new theatre that Ivo van Hove\u2019s company has built. It\u2019s very plain, very beautifully designed and the work they do there is great.</p> <p>My iPhone is like my sixth finger or my third hand. I use it all the time \u2013 I make notes on it, it\u2019s got my diary on it \u2013 although I can live without and do periodically live without it. If I\u2019m walking down the street I feel I\u2019m not complete if I\u2019m not sending an email or something. I used to say I could do two things at once, having a conversation and doing something with my iPhone, but I\u2019ve discovered that I don\u2019t remember the conversation or what I was doing on the phone. So the truth is that I can\u2019t.</p> <p>Quite often, I\u2019m at the theatre at 8am, 8:30am, and often I don\u2019t leave there until 10pm. So my mornings are about speed: I can get from bed to desk in about 55 minutes. I\u2019ve been doing the same journey for so many years now I can do it really fast. I can generally do it in under an hour; best ever is 50 minutes. That does not include breakfast, just getting there with a reasonable quantity of clothes on.</p> <p><strong>My favourite websites </strong>The <em>Guardian</em>, and this American political website called <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/\">Democracy Now!</a> \u2013 they cover stories that very often the other papers don\u2019t, or the papers in this country anyway.</p> <p><strong>I read...</strong> all the time, European history mostly, from the 14th century through until now.

Formerly a curator for Frieze and Studio Voltaire in London, she is renowned for championing young and underrepresented artists.</strong></p> <p>I didn\u2019t really go to a gallery until I was in my late teens; I wasn\u2019t interested in visual arts. It was music that shaped my interest in the arts. When I was younger, I moved around a lot \u2013 I\u2019m a military child \u2013 and by knowing about music I could very quickly find my people, my friends. So in terms of the sort of contemporary art I\u2019m interested in, some of my favourite artists have come from being involved in the subcultures, the music and art scene of their city. For example, in a way, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/mark-leckey\">Mark Leckey</a>\u2019s whole practice is born out of a very specific working-class subculture that\u2019s strongly tied to music and the rave scene. The way he talks about it is that music distinguishes different tribes. So to get a quick overview of good music that\u2019s out I read websites like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/\">Pitchfork</a>, Triple Canopy and <a href=\"http://www.factmag.com/\">Fact</a> (like a British version of Pitchfork). A lot of those sites also commission playlists of new music by DJs and musicians, which are a great way of having fresh music to listen to without doing the legwork. I used to buy a lot of new music but I\u2019m now restricted by time and I don\u2019t really go to record shops any more.</p> <p>I read a lot online. The commercial production company <a href=\"http://somesuch.co/\">Somesuch</a> commissions and publishes great writing on its website \u2013 fiction and essays \u2013 from personal pieces about something very tragic to humorous, insightful pieces on people\u2019s work. It\u2019s just published a small book of fiction too. I love it that this company, which makes really high-end adverts for huge brands, has also done that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/dec/18/mike-kelley-nonconformist-whole-life-here\">Mike Kelley: the nonconformist's whole life is here</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I also religiously follow the journalist Charlie Porter, who has a unique voice \u2013 very funny and opinionated. He comes from a fashion background but is now writing about art and there\u2019s a sense of freedom to what he writes because he\u2019s coming out of left field. Sometimes, people caught up in their own industry forget that they use a particular kind of jargon so when someone comes in from another place it\u2019s really refreshing. Visual art is like anything else \u2013 there\u2019s a whole industry behind it and sometimes you have to fight a little to get through the structures to the good stuff, the meat and potatoes.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to choose one artist who has been my biggest influence but the American artist <a href=\"http://mikekelley.com/\">Mike Kelley</a> is someone I keep coming back to. I think that\u2019s partly because he was a really prolific writer as well. He was able to look at subcultures and write them into stories. One of my interests is in transgressive practices or grotesqueries and Mike wrote a really good book called <em>Foul Perfection</em>.</p> <p>I\u2019m very fond of a group of galleries that work with emerging or under-represented artists in London, such as Studio Voltaire, the <a href=\"http://www.theshowroom.org/\">Showroom</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.chisenhale.org.uk/\">Chisenhale</a>. The recent <a href=\"http://www.studiovoltaire.org/exhibitions/archive/sharon-hayes/\">Sharon Hayes show at Studio Voltaire</a> was superb. Around the country the Hepworth, <a href=\"http://www.dca.org.uk/\">Dundee Contemporary Arts</a> and <a href=\"http://www.balticmill.com/\">Baltic</a> are great venues with strong international programmes. In Glasgow, GoMA is being revitalised with a brilliant new curator, though I\u2019m biased because I recently curated a <a href=\"http://glasgowinternational.org/events/cosima-von-bonin/\">Cosima von Bonin</a> exhibition there. And <a href=\"http://www.kinningparkcomplex.org/\">Kinning Park Complex</a> is an amazing multi-use community centre that houses performances, workshops and events of all types. The last thing I saw there was Glasgow-based feminist warriors Fallop\u00e9 and the Tubes.</p> <p>My favourite pub in the world is the Horse Shoe in Glasgow, where they have karaoke upstairs every night. I heard about it from a cabbie who informed me that a high percentage of the clientele had got quite far on <em>The X Factor</em>. I really love karaoke but I\u2019m quite bad at it. It\u2019s embarrassing, but I don\u2019t care. Sometimes, after a few drinks, I get into a bit of a rant about how everyone should have the right to sing. I like it when people surprise you. A friend, a brilliant artist called Stephen Sutcliffe, got up one night and did Elton John\u2019s I Guess That\u2019s Why They Call it the Blues, and it was amazing. The Horse Shoe also has a bit of a community centre feeling sometimes: you\u2019ll see tables of mum, auntie, nan and the kids who are there for two hours before they go off clubbing. It reminds me a bit of the social centre we used to go to with my family and grandparents when I was much younger, of when we used to go \u201cup the club\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Non-arts stuff I enjoy</strong> I have started horseriding again after an 18-year hiatus. When you move out of London your leisure time is freed up; you don\u2019t slip into the pressures of going to five art openings a night and all of that. <strong>IC</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed8e130134e77447d53c6d4a2d1c926cc64ab5f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed8e130134e77447d53c6d4a2d1c926cc64ab5f4/0_291_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kully Thiarai director of National Theatre Wales\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018TED talks allow you to connect with the world from different perspectives\u2019: Kully Thiarai.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Kully Thiarai: \u2018My favourite cultural venues challenge the norm\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Artistic director at National Theatre Wales, Thiarai is only the second woman, and the first Asian director to lead one of Britain\u2019s national theatre companies. Previously she transformed Doncaster\u2019s cultural scene at the helm of new theatre Cast and has led some of Britain\u2019s key theatre venues and producing companies.</strong></p> <p>When I want to be nourished I go to <a href=\"http://www.ysp.co.uk/\">Yorkshire Sculpture Park</a>. It\u2019s a place for contemplation and inspiration \u2013 you never quite know what you\u2019re going to see. Even the most permanent works can shed new light just because the weather looks different or your walk to it has been from somewhere else. It\u2019s calming to be in nature in that way, to see art in the context of the real world.</p> <p>My favourite cultural venues challenge the norm or at least question it, all in different ways. It\u2019s wonderful to go to a big mainstream venue, but it\u2019s a very different experience encountering the new, the rough and ready. What I find interesting is exploring how we refresh our artform, how we find collisions between things rather than specifying this is theatre, this is dance, this is music. <a href=\"http://www.brad.ac.uk/theatre/\">Theatre in the Mill</a> at Bradford University was very important to me when I was a student there. I saw some extraordinary things. Ruth Mackenzie ran it then and her programme was very inspiring \u2013 shows from the very young <a href=\"http://www.phoenixdancetheatre.co.uk/\">Phoenix Dance</a> and the early work of <a href=\"http://www.unfinishedhistories.com/history/companies/gay-sweatshop/\">Gay Sweatshop</a>. She became a real influence. And the venue continues to have work that is surprising and new and emerging. It\u2019s a bit like the <a href=\"http://www.slunglow.org/what-is-the-hub/\">Hub in Leeds</a>, a space that artists use in different ways, often to present work in its early stages. A nice creative conversation goes along with the presenting of work there and I really love that. I\u2019m also a big admirer of <a href=\"http://contactmcr.com/\">Contact in Manchester</a>. It\u2019s refreshing to hang out in a venue with so much energy and such a commitment to young people.</p> <p>I\u2019ve recently moved to Cardiff so I\u2019m still discovering lots of places there. It\u2019s got a real vibrancy. A cafe called <a href=\"http://milgicardiff.com/\">Milgi</a> does healthy food and juices and is a lovely place to hang out, with great music. Waterloo Tea in Wyndham Arcade is wonderful and there\u2019s a restaurant called the <a href=\"http://purplepoppadom.com/menu/\">Purple Poppadom</a> \u2013 I love the name, but also it does the most delicious food.</p> <p>I like watching <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks\">TED talks</a> to come across a wide variety of ideas, to connect with the world from different perspectives. They\u2019re short and snappy and you can digest them on the move. The famous <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity\">Ken Robinson talk</a> about creativity and schools is joyous to watch because he explains things brilliantly and it\u2019s a masterclass in how to present ideas.</p> <p>The four questions I always try to ask about new work or projects are: why this, why now, why here and who for? They\u2019re also the questions I ask when I\u2019m watching other people\u2019s things. It feels like how is a separate question once you\u2019ve worked out the why.</p> <p><strong>Best social media </strong>I dip into Twitter a lot. My favourite tweets are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemnsissay?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Lemn Sissay\u2019s poems</a>, especially in the mornings. <strong>IC</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a69f905b82b021e651fedc046a08921db33f8227\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a69f905b82b021e651fedc046a08921db33f8227/0_247_5284_3171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Madani Younis, right, with a fellow patron of west London restaurant Ochi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You never know who you are going to meet\u2019: Madani Younis, right, with a fellow patron of west London restaurant Ochi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Madani Younis: \u2018I\u2019m trying to reveal what this moment means in our cultural history\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Artistic director at the world-renowned new writing theatre based in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, west London, and former head of Freedom Studios theatre company in Bradford. When Younis accepted the Bush role in 2012 he became London\u2019s first non\u2011white artistic director.</strong></p> <p>This will probably come as a big surprise, but I\u2019m a huge fan of mixed martial arts, otherwise known as cage fighting, which is an unfortunate expression. The female fighters in mixed martial arts are the most exciting part of the sport. I watched boxing as a kid and found it a bit brutal, but reading Ernest Hemingway made me appreciate it and now mixed martial arts, in a very different way. He writes about it as a balletic art. For him, it\u2019s about the human condition: you enter the ring and you take your destiny, your dreams, with you. Last year, I directed a boxing play entitled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/29/the-royale-review-bush-theatre-powerful-punch\"><em>The Royale</em></a>, about Jack Johnson, the first African American heavyweight boxing champion of the world. I\u2019ve waited my whole career to direct a sports play. So, yes, I love mixed martial arts and I love the <a href=\"http://www.mmafighting.com/\">mmafighting.com</a> app.</p> <p>My mother has been a huge influence on me. She introduced me to the writers who really inspired me early on, people like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesbaldwin\">James Baldwin</a>, Derek Walcott, Ralph Ellison, Bell Hooks. When I read Derek Walcott\u2019s play <em>Dream on Monkey Mountain</em>, aged 16, it just blew my mind. In the same way, reading Baldwin writing about Harlem in the 60s, there was a resonance: I thought, yes, I know what that feels like.</p> <p>I always loved words. I think it was only when I was about 17 that I really fell in love with theatre: I went to the Old Red Lion in Islington, north London, and saw a play about the Troubles in Northern Ireland by Seamus Finnegan. That was the moment. I felt that that artistic communion couldn\u2019t be replicated in any other medium.</p> <p>These days, going to a monthly spoken-word night at the Forge in Camden, called <a href=\"http://www.outspokenldn.com/outspokenlive/\">Out-Spoken</a>, makes me feel like I did when I was 17. I\u2019ve seen some amazing artists there and there\u2019s no censorship, no notes, no separation between me and the artist on stage \u2013 just words from their mouth to your ears, unadulterated. It\u2019s a beautiful kind of communion. Out-Spoken is run by the artist Anthony Anaxagorou and the venue only seats about 100-120 people, but it\u2019s always a great mix of people \u2013 City types, younger men and women.</p> <p>I\u2019m also a huge fan of the <a href=\"http://bcaheritage.tumblr.com/\">Black Cultural Archives</a> in Brixton. It\u2019s a beautifully conceived building. For me, it holds up against any of our other great museums and galleries in the city; I always take visitors there. It\u2019s a reminder of a great lineage of men and women and the impact they\u2019ve had on both our city and our sense of being as a country.</p> <p>There\u2019s a West Indian restaurant/takeaway in Uxbridge Road called <a href=\"http://www.ochitakeaway.co.uk/\">Ochi</a> that I love because it\u2019s been there probably since the 60s/70s and it\u2019s an absolute staple of the community in Shepherd\u2019s Bush. Because of the music venues in the area, such as the Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, now known as the O2, Ochi has this really inspiring wall of fame, with shots of people that have been there to eat, like Bob Marley, Amy Winehouse and Lauryn Hill. The food is amazing and it\u2019s a beautiful place to hang out; you never know who you are going to meet or what you\u2019re going to end up talking about. The other place I like is <a href=\"http://www.bushhalldining.co.uk/\">Bush Hall Dining Rooms</a>, an independent restaurant in Uxbridge Road. The food is really great and it has a cool vibe.</p> <p>The questions I always ask about new ideas are: what is it that this piece is trying to reveal about the world? And: from what vantage point are they trying to do that? More specifically, as a new writing theatre in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, one of London\u2019s most diverse areas, I always ask: how does this speak to London today? In a way I\u2019m trying to reveal \u2013 not in a touristy way \u2013 what this moment means in our cultural history, however uncomfortable or inspiring. If Charles Dickens were alive now, this version of London would be amazing to him.</p> <p><strong>My favourite websites</strong> <a href=\"https://mediadiversified.org/\">Media Diversified</a> gives me another version of the news. It\u2019s a response to the lack of black and minority ethnic journalists writing in our mainstream papers and it covers news, culture, sport and comment. It\u2019s great seeing young journalists quickly develop their voice in that space. I\u2019ve also really been taken by Vice News in the two years since it launched, particularly its global perspective and the level of investigative journalism.</p> <p><strong>Unmissable TV </strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80018294\"><em>Daredevil</em></a><em> </em>on Netflix. It\u2019s based on a Marvel comic book and the writing is really muscular. The other one is <em>House of Cards</em>; my wife and I are addicted to it. What an amazing insight into what politics really is all about. <strong>IC</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90a98b2af9fceaed2214c67b0a9f506b6ca56be8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90a98b2af9fceaed2214c67b0a9f506b6ca56be8/609_567_2391_1435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Baker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Every night I set a new tune to wake me up\u2019: Tom Baker</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carolina Faruolo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tom Baker: \u2018Being in a teenage band gave me a great foundation\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Founder of </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/13/field-day-festival-review-skepta-deerhunter-james-blake-pj-harvey\"><strong>Field Day</strong></a><strong> festival in east London and the live music booking agency Eat Your Own Ears, Baker is often described as London\u2019s best promoter.

Then, once I\u2019m up, I\u2019ll go downstairs and my seven-year-old son will already be listening to music so I\u2019ll chat with him while making coffee on the stove top.</p> <p>I\u2019m biased [because we put on acts there], but in terms of gig venues I really like the <a href=\"http://www.mothclub.co.uk/\">Moth Club</a>, a new 300-capacity venue in Hackney, east London. It\u2019s an old working men\u2019s club with a great sound system. It\u2019s been renovated but very tastefully and it\u2019s got a special feel to it because they\u2019ve still got all the old war memorabilia and old tin hats.</p> <p>Even though I\u2019ve got young children sometimes I come back from a gig and I just need a bit of head space, so I\u2019ll watch a Netflix series, even if it\u2019s midnight. I\u2019ve seen all the obvious ones. I\u2019ve been really enjoying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/peaky-blinders\"><em>Peaky Blinders</em></a> recently.</p> <p>I was five when I went to my first Glastonbury with my parents and then I went every year until I was 12. I started going again when I was 17 with friends. It\u2019s such a magical place I think it definitely inspired me. As a teenager, I was in a band and just embracing so much music \u2013 everything from Miles Davis\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/dec/24/miles-davis-bitches-brew\"><em>Bitches Brew</em></a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/neilyoung\">Neil Young </a>to minimal classical music. It was all very physical \u2013 sharing CDs, you\u2019d work your way through a pile of 10 CDs, whole albums, not just a single track. That gave me a great foundation. I absorbed a lot.</p> <p><strong>I normally have my best ideas... </strong>When I\u2019m at an event and think, oh that\u2019s a good way to do it or I\u2019ll wake up the next day and suddenly, ahhh, how about that? <strong>IC</strong></p>",

  "<p>A football field and a grove of mango trees lie between Bongwe and its neighbouring village. On one side live the family of 33-year-old Subira Mwangole, shot dead by gunmen while watching television with friends one evening in May. On the other live his alleged murderers.</p> <p>The two villages, 30km south of the port city of Mombasa on Kenya\u2019s coast, are almost identical: three-room houses with rusting tin or thatch roofs, a ramshackle primary school, a government office, a small mosque with white walls stained by rain, a crossroads where two tracks meet, a well, small plots of tall corn plants.</p> <p>Yet, despite their placid appearances, the villages lie on the invisible frontline of a brutal, low-level, three-way war pitting security agencies against the Islamic extremist network al-Shabaab, and the militants against the local community. It is a war carried out by small groups of armed men who shoot first and ask few questions.</p> <p>\u201cWe are very anxious, frightened. He knew he could die at any moment. We all know we could be next,\u201d said Ibrahim, a former al-Shabaab fighter and a close relative of Mwangole.</p> <p>There is a steady beat of violence. The extremists murder those they see as a threat. Local human rights groups say the police do the same thing. Both sets of killers know that the fear they provoke brings impunity.</p> <p>Mwangole was particularly hated by al-Shabaab for his role in convincing veterans of the movement to take advantage of an amnesty offered by the Kenyan ministry of the interior last year. The shopkeeper and father of two was himself a defector from the group, which has waged an insurgency in Somalia since 2006 and has expanded across the porous border into Kenya.</p> <p>Mwangole was shot in the head by a group of men dressed as policemen but identified by family members as local members of al-Shabaab. His death was swiftly followed by the murder, in similar circumstances, <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Fear-grips-Kwale-as-three-Nyumba-Kumi-officials-are-killed-/-/1056/3224602/-/tkptij/-/index.html\" title=\"\">of three community leaders in Bongwe</a>. All were involved in government \u201canti-radicalisation\u201d schemes.</p> <p>Hundreds have died at the hands of Islamic militants in Kenya in recent decades. A first wave of violence between 1998 and 2002 was directed by al-Qaida against foreign targets, including US embassies and Israeli tourists. It had ebbed by the middle of the last decade.</p> <p>But radicalism was growing among Kenya\u2019s Muslim minority, fuelled by a sense of marginalisation, extremist clerics, the impact of the US-led \u201cwar on terror\u201d and a shift away from traditional moderate Islamic practices to more rigorous versions of the faith influenced by countries in the Gulf.</p> <p>In 2013 gunmen from al-Shabaab <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24191606\" title=\"\">stormed a shopping mall in Nairobi,</a> Kenya\u2019s capital, killing 67 people. Last year 148 people were shot dead at a university in Kenya\u2019s north-east. Both attacks were launched from Somalia, where Kenyan troops are fighting the extremists as part of an African Union force, but focused attention on support networks within Kenya itself.</p> <p>Investigators found that young men from villages such as Bongwe in Kwale county had been travelling to Somalia to fight with al-Shabaab for over a decade. Authorities launched a major crackdown and, officials say, a comprehensive \u201canti-radicalisation\u201d strategy. One element was the amnesty announced last year. By this spring, 70 al-Shabaab veterans \u2013 or returnees \u2013 had made a clean breast of their militant past to authorities, receiving an assurance that they would not be prosecuted in return.</p> <p>According to local journalists and former al-Shabaab fighter Sami, who worked closely with Mwangole and was a friend, two amnestied returnees have since been killed, as have six other al-Shabaab veterans.</p> <p>\u201cWe trusted the government. We thought we could live a better life, in peace, and put our past behind us,\u201d Sami said.</p> <p>Many amnestied veterans receive constant threats from militants, while also facing harassment from police. \u201cThe government issued an amnesty that was not anchored in law,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.hakiafrica.or.ke/index.php/en/\" title=\"\">Hussein Khaled, of Haki-Africa, a human rights monitoring group in Mombasa.</a></p> <p>The identity of the alleged killers of Mwangole and the three community leaders reveals how, despite the extremist rhetoric of \u201cglobal jihad\u201d, the conflict being fought out in Kwale is very intimate.</p> <p>In interviews with the <em>Observer</em>, Mwangole\u2019s relatives and friends blamed a band of a dozen young men from the neighbouring village for the murders in Bongwe. Most are in their 20s and only recently recruited to al-Shabaab. They include several relatives of the victims. Well before the four murders in May, the group had already made a series of threats to amnestied veterans, accusing them of treachery and spying for the government.</p> <p>Sami, who returned from a stint in Somalia with al-Shabaab six years ago, said: \u201cWe went to the police. We identified those threatening us, but they did nothing. Sometimes I think they wanted Mwangole to be killed \u2013 that\u2019s why they gave him no protection.\u201d</p> <p>In June, police detained 10 men for the killings, including three of those named by Mwangole\u2019s relatives. They say they are confident they have now broken up the network. This has inspired little confidence in Bongwe, however, where the authorities are as feared as al-Shabaab. Campaigners claim systematic human rights abuses by the police, including 70 extrajudicial \u201cexecutions\u201d or disappearances in the past year alone in and around Mombasa.</p> <p>Many such killings and disappearances involve former members of al-Shabaab, or individuals alleged to be extremists. At least three alleged members of al-Shabaab in Kwale have been shot dead by police in recent months.</p> <p>One, named as Omar Hesbon Matheka, died on 4 June when he was <a href=\"http://%20http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000204058/mother-cries-foul-as-police-insist-slain-man-was-a-terror-suspect\" title=\"\">\u201crunning while shooting at the police\u201d, according to officials,</a> who claimed a grenade had been found among the dead man\u2019s possessions. Witnesses said Matheka was killed by officers while sitting in a rickshaw. His mother told local newspapers that the 24-year-old was looking for work.</p> <p>\u201cTerrorism is the worst form of human rights violation. We want to eradicate terrorism \u2026 [but] it seems that the [government] strategy is simply using firepower. There is nothing about community resilience, addressing underlying problems or rule of law,\u201d said human rights activist Khaled.</p> <p>Maalim Mohammed, the police commissioner of Mombasa, denied any human rights abuses by Kenyan security agencies. \u201cThese allegations are baseless, malicious and unfair,\u201d he said. \u201cOur constitution and laws are very clear and we always respect the process. You cannot use coercive means to win against terrorism. You need to win hearts and minds. We get a lot of information from the community.\u201d</p> <p>The police crackdown has had a significant impact \u2013 at least in the short term. Analysts say the al-Shabaab support network on the coast and elsewhere is much weaker than it was, and has been eradicated in Mombasa.</p> <p>The British and US governments recently lifted <a href=\"http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2015/11/17/us-uk-tourists-flock-to-kenya-after-travel-warnings-lifted_c1243184\" title=\"\">travel warnings</a> applied two years ago to almost all of Kenya\u2019s Indian Ocean coastline, giving the crucial tourist industry a much-needed boost. \u201cWe can assure all visitors that they will be entirely safe here on the coast of Kenya,\u201d Mohammed said.</p> <p>But there are still frequent cross-border incidents. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-attacks-idUSKCN0Z60SE\" title=\"\">Five policemen were recently killed by suspected al-Shabaab fighters</a> near the border with Somalia. There is also continuing recruitment, according to villagers. Several Kwale county residents, who did not want to be named, added that some women are also attracted by the extremist ideology, and marry al-Shabaab veterans in the area.</p> <p>Last weekend Bongwe and its neighbouring village were calm. Both were full of women wearing flowing robes. Young children, cows and chickens wandered between the trees. A dozen youths wearing old T-shirts played on the football pitch.</p> <p>\u201cI left one war behind me in Somalia when I returned,\u201d said Ibrahim. \u201cBut now I am in the middle of another one.\u201d</p>",

This is apt. His clay drawing was first created for this very place. A black-and-white photograph from 1971 shows visitors in bell-bottoms making their meditative way around the maze in exactly the same spot. We walk the line just as they once did. The artwork has vanished only to reappear, apparently unchanged. Time flows both forwards and backwards.</p> <p>Modern Art Oxford is a mountain in the landscape of modern art. Founded in 1966, it was one of that great wave of new institutions that included the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, the Camden Arts Centre in London and the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham. Although it was known as the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford right up until its name changed in 2002, there was never any sign of a permanent collection. In fact, the temporary exhibitions changed with what now seems like extraordinary rapidity \u2013 six, seven or even eight in one year.</p> <p>It was here that I first saw the work of Bill Brandt, Peter Kennard, Agnes Martin and Robert Mapplethorpe. Generations of students took in the latest art upstairs before descending to the basement for the stout but inexpensive food. David Elliott, director for 20 years until 1996, mounted Indian, Japanese and Soviet seasons, with vivid shows on Pasternak and Mayakovsky. You looked and learned, and occasionally you listened. Bands played. Artists talked. Films were screened. Marina Abramovi\u0107 performed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2470004c289511e046825385a1af720692da56c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2470004c289511e046825385a1af720692da56c/0_114_3744_5180/723.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Reason weighed against the mysteries of nature\u2019: Scales, 2014 (detail) by Dorothy Cross, made from the gilded halves of a split cranium.\" width=\"723\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Reason weighed against the mysteries of nature\u2019: Scales, 2014 (detail) by Dorothy Cross, made from the gilded halves of a split cranium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and the Kerlin Gallery, Dublin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nicholas Serota, one of the earliest directors, brought Joseph Beuys, Christian Boltanski and Carl Andre to Oxford. He invited Sol LeWitt to draw directly on the walls. The gallery was always concerned with ideas as much as artworks; <a href=\"https://www.modernartoxford.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1966-Space-Place.jpg\">Space Place</a> was the title of its first major show.</p> <p>And so it is with the present event. The gallery texts go on about the digital era in which message speaks unto message and people are more likely to be immersed in their smartphones than in the great outdoors. The artists have been chosen supposedly because they \u201cinvestigate ways in which we may connect more deeply with nature\u201d. This is acceptable persiflage, of course, a ruse for gathering together some of the most illustrious names of the gallery\u2019s half century. So there are pieces by Abramovi\u0107, Agnes Martin, Helen Chadwick and Yoko Ono, who gives the viewer a set of airy instructions: \u201cImagine the clouds dripping/ Dig a hole in your garden to put them in.\u201d This was the 60s, but Ono hasn\u2019t changed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9034a6ec3a7ab1fd194f32f4c4ae7f281002c1e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9034a6ec3a7ab1fd194f32f4c4ae7f281002c1e6/0_0_2130_681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Chadwick\u2019s Viral Landscapes (detail) 1988-89.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"320\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen Chadwick\u2019s Viral Landscapes (detail), 1988-89.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy National Museums Liverpool</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abramovi\u0107 painstakingly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROpzkh40Lmk\">washes the bones of a human skeleton</a> as a way of exorcising her terror of death.

Chadwick\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.modernartoxford.org.uk/archive-helen-chadwick-viral-landscapes-1989-1990/\"><em>Viral Landscapes</em></a> (1989-90), made at the height of the Aids epidemic, connect the changes in her body with those of the wave-shattered shoreline, superimposing outsize photographs with magnified images of the artist\u2019s cellular tissue in a sweeping panorama of time and tide. For nature, at this point, read death.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/22/agnes-martin-the-artist-mystic-who-disappeared-into-the-desert\">Agnes Martin</a>\u2019s silkscreen prints turn towards the light. Serenely beautiful, these permutations on the simple intersection of straight lines seem to expand on the walls in endlessly varying grids. Each print seems to hint at infinity and is yet completely contained by geometry. <a href=\"http://collections.lacma.org/node/155378\"><em>On a Clear Day</em></a> (1973), made in New Mexico, was Martin\u2019s title for this captivating sequence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f68ede85edc4c36f1d97bd0f0062d76bc50ec051\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f68ede85edc4c36f1d97bd0f0062d76bc50ec051/0_0_3719_5579/667.jpg\" alt=\"Distil, 2014 by Dorothy Cross.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Distil, 2014 by Dorothy Cross.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and the Kerlin Gallery, Dublin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is almost a miniature <a href=\"http://www.frithstreetgallery.com/artists/bio/dorothy_cross\">Dorothy Cross</a> show-within-a-show here, with several large installations by the Irish artist. Inside a high glass dome, a barrister\u2019s wig rests on a pillar of grey marble, as if the truth upon which the law depends was inevitably a grey matter. In another outlandish spectacle, an antique telescope dangles like a plumb line above a beautiful shell, silver inside (in fact it is a fragment of skull). Classical pediments balance on pillars of beachwood.</p> <p>The objects of our empirical endeavour are juxtaposed with the equally elegant flotsam of nature. In some cases they are locked in poetic impasse. From a coathanger hangs a pair of golden scales containing sparkling meteorites; up close, these turn out to be the gilded halves of a split cranium, the two sides cupping what are themselves the relics of dead stars. Cross weighs reason against the mysteries of nature.</p> <p>In the last gallery, Abramovi\u0107\u2019s <em>Black Dragon</em> projects from the wall: three chunks of quartz positioned at head, heart and loin height; the artist was apparently investigating the healing power of crystals. Back in the 90s, visitors were urged to lean against them, but not any more. Now all touching is forbidden. This is one story of our experience of art in the past 50 years, permanently distorted by soaring prices and insurance costs. But it is also, in another sense, the story of Modern Art Oxford \u2013 a place where so many people had their first glimpse of international artists in solo shows before they became too big for this world.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.modernartoxford.org.uk/event/its-me-to-the-world/\">It\u2019s Me to the World is at Modern Art Oxford until 11 November</a></li> </ul>",

Wilson is a dab hand at this kind of assignment, evading stock answers and getting at fragments of honest insight. He had Jones, composer and producer for everyone from Ray Charles through Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson, talking about growing up in South Side Chicago gangs. Jones traced for Wilson the scar on his hand where a switchblade nailed him to a fence, and another from an ice pick on his head. He received both wounds when he was seven years old, giving a lie to any \u201cshow me the child\u201d notions. He claimed he first saw a piano when he came across one in a house he had broken into as a boy. He recalled how, on touching the keys, \u201cevery cell in my body told me this was what I would do for the rest of my life\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07pfc4m\" title=\"\">subsequent <strong>Proms </strong>performance</a> of his music by the Metropole Orkest, led by Jules Buckley, revealed the joyous results of that premonition 70&#xa0;years on. The two-hour tribute was a masterclass in some of the most irresistible American dance music of those decades, from big band jazz to hip-hop (or from Billie Holiday to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi_XLOBDo_Y\" title=\"\">Billie Jean,</a> as Wilson observed).</p> <p>Jones said he recognised only two categories of music: good and bad. By the time he came on stage to conduct a full orchestral finale of his song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r55Dftrl5Fs\" title=\"\">Let the Good Times Roll,</a> it was clear into which grouping, in a Proms programme that placed him between Mendelssohn and Tchaikovsky, his output belonged. Jones\u2019s doctors apparently believe he is good for another 30 years yet. He has recently given up drinking. \u201cI feel like a 19-year-old again,\u201d he said, brightly.</p> <p>The week-long series <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07r1jtj\" title=\"\"><strong>Unforgettable</strong></a> took its name from the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE9zy5UKCTU\" title=\"\">famous duet</a> between Natalie Cole and an intimate recording of her late father, Nat. There have been plenty of musical collaborations between the living and the dead since, but this attempt at extending the principle to an interview format was a first. It just about worked, thanks mainly to speed editing technology and a deft choice of interviewers and subjects. The TV writer Tony Garnett, whose credits included <em>Cathy Come Home</em>, revived his arguments of the 1960s and 1970s with the moralising Mary Whitehouse, no less formidable from beyond the grave. It was a treat, too, to hear the warm wisdom of Douglas Adams and Derek Jarman, \u201cinterviewed\u201d respectively by business partner and brother-in-law, and half-imagine that their singular spirits lived undimmed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f641fc9fa75424aee9ade8132c67a8b332a0727a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f641fc9fa75424aee9ade8132c67a8b332a0727a/36_31_1972_1183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The ruins of Hiroshima after the 1945 nuclear attack\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The stories of six survivors of the Hiroshima nuclear attack were heard in John Hersey\u2019s account.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were very different haunting voices in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07pfdvw\" title=\"\"><strong>Hersey\u2019s Hiroshima</strong></a>, which told the story of the landmark publication of war reporter John Hersey\u2019s account of the experiences of six survivors of the first nuclear attack. Peter Curran\u2019s programme reflected on the impact of those first-hand accounts, which evaded the US censor, and were published in a special issue of the <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1946/08/31/hiroshima\" title=\"\"><em>New&#xa0;Yorker</em> in August 1946</a>. The print run sold out in hours and magazines sold for hundreds of times the cover price. Albert Einstein sent 1,000 scientists across the world a copy to bring home the human consequence of nuclear warfare.</p> <p>A year after Hersey published his story, the BBC produced readings of his survivors\u2019 stories in four half-hour instalments, rendered in unflinching received pronunciation. Those original&#xa0;recordings, available on Radio 4 Extra, retain all of their power to shock. In forensic detail, Hersey\u2019s witnesses \u2013 the doctor who found himself the only unhurt survivor in the city\u2019s hospital as the tide of wounded and dying flooded in, the mother scrabbling for her children in the rubble \u2013 recall the hours before and after the bomb. Their stories, partly because of the stiff upper lip of their telling, sound like our Pompeii: immediate and human, forever set in stone. Unforgettable indeed.</p>",
  "<p>Now that the end of August approaches, we come to the turn of another season. The light becomes warmer and the air becomes cooler. Days shorten and the leaves begin to shrivel on the trees before their inevitable fall over the next few months. Summer draws to an end and autumn begins \u2013 the season that bears my favourite fruits. From apples to muscat and fragolina grapes, and of course figs along with their leaves, the flavours at this time of year are simultaneously common and complex.</p> <p>Let\u2019s begin with the apple. We all know apples well, or we think we do. Their ability to store well and grow easily in this climate have made them a fruit bowl fixture. I challenge you to walk past the sadly bagged-up apples at the supermarket and seek out some of the truly interesting varieties that can be found at farmer\u2019s markets and smaller shops. I tried one last year called a Chegworth Beauty, and I always love the Discovery apple \u2013 one of the first of the season to appear.</p> <p>For a tarte tatin, which falls somewhere between a pie and a tart, you are looking for a decent-sized apple with a firm texture and plenty of acidity. The large pieces of apple in this tart should keep their natural shape once baked for almost an hour, but still be soft and tender so that a spoon can easily pass through them. A good cook should never be afraid to slightly burn the caramel either. A dark caramel adds welcome bitterness to your baking.</p> <p>If you savour another challenge, make your own puff pastry. Here I have one for my rough puff, which is relatively quick to make. I have to admit, I usually have a block of ready-made in my freezer, but the real thing tastes so much better.</p> <h2><strong>Apple tarte tatin with pink peppercorns (main picture)<br></strong></h2> <p><strong>Serves 6-8</strong><br>3 tbsp butter<br>135g caster sugar<br>10-12 large apples peeled, cored and quartered<br>\u00bc tsp pink peppercorns, roughly ground<br>500g puff pastry, rolled into a 26cm circle and chilled</p> <p><strong>For the sauce</strong><br>200g sugar<br>2 tbsp water<br>100ml apple juice<br>25g unsalted butter, cut into 1cm pieces<br>Salt and brandy or calvados, to taste (optional)<br>Creme fraiche, to serve</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Have ready an ice-water bath large enough for a 25cm cast iron frying pan or copper tatin mould. Caramelise 2 tbsp butter and 6 tbsp of sugar over a high heat, swirling the pan now and then. Once the sugar has dissolved, use a wooden spoon or balloon whisk to bring it all together. Do not worry if it splits or crystallises, as it will dissolve again during the baking process. You want a deep, dark caramel. Remove from the heat and immediately put the pan on the ice water to stop the caramel from colouring any further.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Arrange the apples, bearing in mind they will be upside down when done, so make them look pretty. I place the curved side down into the caramel, cored-side up. Place a second layer of apples on top, cored-side down, and press gently with your hands coaxing them to fit together like a puzzle.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Sprinkle the ground peppercorns over the top. Cover with the disc of rolled, chilled pastry, tucking the edges in between the apples and the pan. Melt the remaining 1 tbsp butter and brush the pastry with it. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tbsp sugar, then pierce several times with a knife to allow steam to escape during baking.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/20/brown-sugar-plum-mess-recipe-tonka-rye-crisp-claire-ptak-baking-the-seasons\">Claire Ptak\u2019s sweet plum recipes | Baking</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>4</strong> Bake the tarte tatin for 45-55 minutes, or until the pastry is crisp and golden, the sugar has started to caramelise on top, and the apple beneath is starting to bubble up at the edges.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Meanwhile, make the sauce. Add the sugar and water to a heavy-based pan and cook over a medium heat until dissolved, swirling the pan gently, without stirring. Once dissolved, raise the heat to high and caramelise. Have your apple juice ready. Once the caramel is a dark amber colour, remove from the heat immediately and stop the cooking by carefully pouring in the apple juice and whisking. Drop in the butter, and whisk until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Add a little salt or 1 tbsp apple brandy, if you like.</p> <p><strong>6</strong> Remove from the oven and allow the tart to sit undisturbed for 10 minutes. Have ready a large plate that will completely cover the top of the tarte tatin. Using extreme caution, place the plate over the pan and, using an oven glove or tea towel wrapped around the outside, quickly flip the pan over and turn the tart out on to the plate in one smooth motion, being cautious of any hot liquid or steam that might escape.</p> <p><strong>7</strong> Serve with a dollop of creme fraiche and the apple caramel sauce poured over the top.</p> <h2><strong>Rough puff pastry</strong></h2> <p><strong>Makes around 1kg</strong><br>500g butter<br>190ml ice cold water<br>1 tsp lemon juice<br>280g plain flour<br>100g bread flour<br>\u00bd tsp fine sea salt</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Cut the butter into 2cm cubes and arrange them on a baking sheet. Freeze. Add the lemon juice to the water and keep in the fridge.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine both flours with the salt. Add the chilled butter on a low speed and mix to knock off the corners of the cubes.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> With the mixer running, drizzle in the water and lemon juice mixture until it just comes together as a raggedy dough.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Lay a piece of parchment on your work surface, and turn the dough out on to it. Shape the dough into a block. Roll to 38 x 25cm. Fold in thirds, like a letter, make an impression with your thumb on the top, cover loosely with clingfilm and chill for 20 minutes. Repeat 4 more times (5 in total), resting for 20 minutes in between each roll and fold.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> After the fifth turn, divide the dough into two blocks. Use right away or freeze until needed.</p> <ul> <li><em>Claire Ptak is a pastry chef, author and food stylist and owns Violet Bakery in London.

  "<p><strong>The Classroom, CAVC City Centre Campus, Dumballs Road, Cardiff CF10 5FE (029 2025 0377). Meal for two, including drinks and service: \u00a360</strong></p> <p>Even the greenest of cities have their tattered edges and Cardiff, which is greener than most, is no exception. If you get a window seat at this week\u2019s restaurant, try not to look straight down. You\u2019re more likely to catch sight of copulating seagulls on the battered roof of the industrial unit across the road than anything particularly inspiring. (Unless shagging seagulls does it for you; each to their own.) Fix your eyes instead on the verdant horizon, on the lush parks that run up to the hills surrounding the Welsh capital.</p> <p>Better still look inwards to the airy space of The <a href=\"http://www.theclassroom.wales/\">Classroom</a>, the restaurant venture for catering students located on the fifth floor of the city centre campus of Cardiff and Vale College. It\u2019s a lofty vault of sunlight and optimism, and reassuringly good food. I could claim it\u2019s a useful addition to Cardiff\u2019s burgeoning culinary scene but this would be a lie because, while the city has many good things to recommend it, the eating opportunities are not among them. So no, it\u2019s not just a useful addition. It\u2019s more than that.</p> <p>Ah, listen to the howl of outrage. Cardiff is a greedy person\u2019s nirvana, they insist. Or perhaps not. Given the city\u2019s size and its population of 340,000 \u2013 more than a million in the wider metropolitan area \u2013 the choices are limited. On the upside it appears to have a number of interesting kebab places. Last year when <em>Wales Online</em> published its list of Cardiff\u2019s 50 best restaurants, it included burger joints, a couple of chains and a cheese shop with a caf\u00e9 that actually boasted on its website of the appalling service. Oh, and quite a number of interesting kebab places.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4c2520953498f777f951a3793517b6b7b06ab48e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c2520953498f777f951a3793517b6b7b06ab48e/2084_318_3556_3555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Soft and smooth but unashamedly rich\u2019: chicken liver parfait.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Soft and smooth but unashamedly rich\u2019: chicken liver parfait.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I should also point out that at 10.30pm on a Thursday night in the city centre, desperate for something to eat, I had to resort to a bacon double cheeseburger from Burger King, because literally nothing else was open. Some of you will doubtless tell me I wasn\u2019t trying hard enough because there are quite a number of interesting kebab places. But the truth is I rather liked it. Remember, inside every restaurant critic picking at their plate of roast swan, is a filthy dirty food slut fighting to get out.</p> <p>Still, it does mean that alongside bankers like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/nov/20/jay-rayner-potted-pig-cardiff\">Potted Pig</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/05/purple-poppadom-cardiff-restaurant-review\">Purple Poppadom</a> \u2013 if it begins with a P in Cardiff it\u2019s a winner \u2013 the Classroom really is worth knowing about. The idea of a restaurant in which students practise their trade for paying punters is nothing new. I should disclose that the day I ate there most of the students were elsewhere, graduating, and the Classroom was running a special menu for those celebrating the end of their degrees. That said, an apprentice was still working in the kitchen, alongside the hardened professionals who are always in attendance, led by head chef Alex Smith. (Chefs like <a href=\"http://www.jamessommerinrestaurant.co.uk/\">James Sommerin </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2005/mar/06/features.magazine107\">Hywel Jones </a>are also involved with courses here).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f906eb9fa37ff2ff32a2fe17a24eb2f691dc4a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f906eb9fa37ff2ff32a2fe17a24eb2f691dc4a2/0_243_7277_4366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Perfectly seasoned: Thai fishcake.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Perfectly seasoned: Thai fishcake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That Graduation Menu, at \u00a318.50 for three courses, reads like a cooking syllabus: a soup, a fishcake, a parfait (served with bread baked on site) or a savoury tart to start; a fish dish, a coq au vin, steak and chips, and a plate of gnocchi for mains; a chocolate tart; a posset and some ices to finish. Get across all those dishes and you\u2019d have more than a hand hold on the fundamentals of what we\u2019re now meant to call Modern European cooking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>That Graduation Menu reads like a cooking syllabus</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They do these things well, some of them very well indeed. That fishcake is a perfectly seasoned ball of flaked salmon and cod, with scant evidence of potato filler, on a bed of wilted spinach with a deep pond of frothy, hand-whipped hollandaise. The scoop of chicken liver parfait is soft and smooth but unashamedly rich, as it should be for something made from the inner bits of the animal. It comes with their own thick-cut toasted brioche, made with enough butter to make the spreading of more redundant.</p> <p>A fillet of cod, seared until the skin is crisp, falls apart with the nudge of a fork. It lies on a pillow of mash with a creamed fish sauce, which may not quite be the essence of the bouillabaisse the menu claims, but which is still a ripe old slap of seafood cooked down to become the very best of itself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13a2aee6a3b506a03322dbfd22ab77d96f65be71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13a2aee6a3b506a03322dbfd22ab77d96f65be71/0_228_7273_4366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Well assembled: \u2018coq au vin\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Well assembled: \u2018coq au vin\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it\u2019s the take on coq au vin which seals it for me. On the menu they put the title in inverted commas and rightly so, because this is not a long-cooked stew but an assemblage. Happily, it\u2019s been assembled bloody well. There\u2019s a roasted chicken breast, skin crisped, the whole sliced on the bias. It lies on more mash, with a few greens off to the side for your good health. It\u2019s surrounded by crisped lardons, button onions and mushrooms, as it should be. What brings it together is the sauce. It is the colour of a well-varnished oak table. It has the kind of stickiness that makes you smack your lips without forcing you to reach for a glass of water. It is deep and rich, without being cloying. It is a masterclass in careful reduction.</p> <p>Which is when I ask the chap looking after us whether everything is made here. Yes, he says: the sauce, the hollandaise, the parfait, the bread. It\u2019s mildly depressing that I\u2019m impressed by this. Then again the dirty secret of professional catering is that the dark arts of the food service companies \u2013 sauce bases and chips, salad dressings, breads and cakes and the like \u2013 can slip unannounced on to the menus of even some of the fancier places. In truth the food service companies are just getting very good at this stuff, as proved by the pastry shell used in a chocolate and whisky tart which the kitchen freely volunteers is the one thing they\u2019ve bought in. During graduation week trade can be brisk, and it\u2019s a useful shortcut.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4bb9751167d0611cd3a9455cf5f62d72aa80a96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4bb9751167d0611cd3a9455cf5f62d72aa80a96/0_264_7305_4384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"'Dark, bitter, not too thick': chocolate and whisky tart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Dark, bitter, not too thick\u2019: chocolate and whisky tart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019ll allow them that. It\u2019s a clever pastry shell: crisp round the edges, light and spongy beneath. The rest is theirs, including the chocolate and whisky filling which is dark and bitter but not overly thick, and the smooth vanilla ice cream. A lemon and passionfruit posset, under an almond crumble, could have been a little sharper for my taste \u2013 but it is only my taste. You get the idea. I like the Classroom. It\u2019s not trying to innovate. It\u2019s not pushing any boundaries. It\u2019s just trying to teach the fundamentals. And it\u2019s the diner who benefits.</p> <h2>Jay\u2019s news bites</h2> <p>\u25a0 One of the more spendy student-run restaurant operations belongs to the Tante Marie Culinary Academy in Woking.
