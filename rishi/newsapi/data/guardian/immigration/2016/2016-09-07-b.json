  "<p><br>In the wake of the spectacular Democratic convention it seems unreasonable even to hint at the possibility that Donald Trump might win. Such speeches! Such enthusiasm! Such ideals! Such drama and emotion! Such a pseudo-event!</p> <p>But a woman nominee \u2013 such a moment. And one to make Trumpland look ridiculous. Even that old lizard Bill Clinton was poignant in his way.<br></p> <p> But Bill Clinton is the author of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and the president who ended Glass\u2013Steagall, the 1933 act that prohibited banks from engaging in the investment business. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton is going to the fight with Trump on a promise to at least look again at Nafta and reintroduce an equivalent to Glass\u2013Steagall to keep the banks in line. Thanks to Bernie Sanders, that\u2019s in the platform. So is a resolution to break up the banks that Congress bailed out \u2013 and didn\u2019t punish for their sins. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/emotion-watching-hillary-clinton-woman-candidate-for-president\">Hillary Clinton's speech was a powerful, primal first \u2013 and it blew me away | Xeni Jardin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hillary is also now committed to scuttling the Trans Pacific Partnership, which her new pal President Obama badly wants because it\u2019s a big part of his geopolitics. Hillary Clinton has a platform that really isn\u2019t hers. The Democrats are proceeding as one party, but in truth there are now two \u2013 one subscribes to neoliberalism and the other foreshadows its demise \u2013 and she has to represent both of them. Philadelphia was a beautiful and moving thing, and Democrats can only hope that all those tears of joy and love were enough to wash away the contradictions.</p> <p> This might be unfair. Whether she was driven there by Bernie Sanders or has chosen to renew her old Methodist vows to the poor and meek, Clinton is running on a progressive ticket now, and she might decide to make that the colour of her presidency. She promises to invest heavily in the cities to lift people out of poverty; to invest in infrastructure, create jobs, revive manufacturing and raise the minimum wage. The platform promises comprehensive immigration reform, an end to student debt, paid family leave and much else. It <em>is</em><em> </em>very likely what Sanders said it was \u2013 the most progressive platform in the party\u2019s history.</p> <p> Listening to her now, you might think that after years as a member of the supply-side economics church, Hillary Clinton\u2019s joined the revived and steadily expanding demand-side one. Could she in eight years reverse the engines of inequality and corruption, bridge the divides and enliven the democracy? Could she desegregate the cities? </p> <p>Could she get her country leading the world by example to save the planet from global warming? Could she do something about the lobbyists, the power of money in Washington that is destroying American democracy from within? Take on Wall Street? Make the effort on behalf of public decency and ordinary justice that was not made after the financial collapse? Could she get the public interest represented in Washington again? </p> <p>Could she do something about guns? In Chicago on the Memorial Day weekend, sixty-nine people were shot. Six died. As of 1 August, 401 people had been murdered in that one city in 2016, 90% of them with guns.</p> <p> Are <em>any</em><em> </em>of these things open to remedy? Probably not: the problems run too deep, but the effort would be uplifting and a more productive way to prove her country is exceptional than anything she might have in mind for bloodying foreign noses.</p> <p> Could she get American troops out of Afghanistan, the fifteen-year war she mentioned not once in her acceptance speech in Philadelphia? That might be the most unlikely of all.</p> <p> Nothing she says, old or new, will much impress voters who don\u2019t trust the Clintons, or think they reek of entitlement, lies and money. The hole she\u2019s punched in the glass ceiling won\u2019t impress them. But the prospect of Hillary and Bill back in the White House might lift their loathing into realms of mania. It will feel like the ultimate corruption, the ultimate insult, the ultimate proof that the system stinks.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to share this point of view to understand it. At the very least, her supporters could ask themselves what <em>they</em><em> </em>would be making of the $153m in speaking fees or the $1.8m she collected from speeches to the banks, if they were pinned to Donald Trump \u2013 or to Mitt Romney or John McCain. Ditto the emails. The reasonable fear is that Hillary Clinton will be tempted to pacify the haters by the military expression of exceptionalism.</p> <p> Clinton just <em>has</em><em> </em>to win. If she loses, not only does the world get Donald Trump (and the US Supreme Court his appointments): the Democrats will have to live forever with their decision to make their nominee the most qualified presidential candidate in history, but also the person most disliked by the American public and possibly the only one that Trump could beat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-honest-transparency-jill-abramson\">This may shock you: Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest | Jill Abramson</a> </p> </aside>  <p> We can hope that from her example great numbers of American women will draw inspiration, and believe that both wisdom and opportunity will deepen with their influence on public life. It should have been a moment of pure celebration, seeing Elizabeth Warren on the hustings with Clinton early in June. But you could feel the hackles rising on every neck in every bar in every swing state across the country. Warren mocking Trump, trading insults \u2013 and the guys in the bar think she\u2019s mocking <em>them</em><em> </em>and make a little resolution and write it inside their hats \u2013 \u201cVote this time.\u201d The triumph of one identity is the violation of another.</p> <p> Trump says, Hand your fear over to me. Hand your loathing over too. I will deal with your enemies as I have dealt with mine. I will give you back your freedom, and your country. Your old lives will be yours to live again. I will halt the terminal decline. American exceptionalism, in which you all hold shares, will be underwritten by an exceptional American.</p> <p> The Democrats scoff at Trump for wanting to take the country back to the past. But for many of the people whose votes will count in November, Trump\u2019s imaginary past is a more concrete thing to contemplate than the Democrats\u2019 imaginary present. Trump\u2019s also contains more hope, and it serves as a more believable American tomorrow. If, as seems likely, Clinton wins, it will not be out of love, or even hope, but rather out of fear. She can win by simply letting her deplorable opponent lose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8f0255fd56edd51768f47b90182ee42e4ed20442\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f0255fd56edd51768f47b90182ee42e4ed20442/0_0_1972_2764/713.jpg\" alt=\"Quarterly Essay Enemy Within by Don Watson\" width=\"713\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quarterly Essay Enemy Within by Don Watson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quarterly Essay</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the other hand, she\u2019s nothing if not adaptable, and she could yet see in these very favourable circumstances (the Republicans falling apart, negligible interest rates, a public appetite for radical reform) the chance to lead the nation\u2019s social and economic regeneration through, for a start, massive investment in education, renewable energy and infrastructure, and an equally massive legislative attack on inequality and political corruption. </p> <p>Call it a New Great Awakening or a New New Deal; it would owe something to both, and to Bernie Sanders as well, but also to her need to be more than the first woman president.

  "<p>Hate crime surged in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the second half of July \u2013 nearly a month after the EU referendum vote \u2013 and still remains at significantly higher levels than a year ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/man-in-harlow-assault-died-from-single-punch-to-the-head-cctv-shows\">Man in Harlow assault died after single punch to the head, CCTV shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The latest set of figures quietly released by the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council on Wednesday show a 49% rise in incidents to 1,863 in the last week in July when compared with the previous year. The week after saw a record 58% increase in recorded incidents to 1,787. </p> <p>Jack Dromey, who was Labour\u2019s shadow police minister for three years, said: \u201cMany victims are still afraid to come forward and so the scale of attacks could be far higher than what is being reported. The UN said two weeks ago that the problem of underreporting hate crime persists in Britain and the government\u2019s own hate-crime strategy sets out to increase the reporting of hate crime, acknowledging one of the biggest challenges to the police in tackling it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Previously published official figures had revealed that there had been a 46% spike \u2013 then the worst on record \u2013 in reports of hate crime to the police in the week immediately after the 23 June referendum.

For this reason, we will return to our previous reporting procedures and will no longer be requiring weekly updates from forces,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that hate crime is no longer a priority. We know that divisions still exist in our society and that tensions could rise again. Police forces will continue with their robust response and we will react swiftly to any future signs of tension.\u201d</p> <p>The disclosure comes in a week when senior Polish ministers travelled to Britain to seek reassurances about the safety of the Polish community in the UK in the aftermath of the fatal attack on Arkadiusz J\u00f3\u017awik in Harlow, Essex. A silent vigil and march was held in Harlow at the weekend.</p> <p>Dromey said it was not yet the right time for the police to decide to stop collecting weekly figures. \u201cThe national rate of reported hate crimes remains higher than at this point last year and the high-profile attacks in Harlow show that there is still a deeply worrying trend of abuse and violence.\u201d</p> <p>The police linked the spike in hate crime incidents immediately after the June referendum directly to the vote, saying people had taken the vote to leave the EU as a licence to behave in a racist or discriminatory way. Offences had been mainly harassment and threats of a racist nature against \u201cvisible minorities\u201d as well as people from eastern Europe.</p> <p>Amber Rudd, the home secretary, went further when she discussed the figures with MPs on the home affairs select committee on Wednesday, saying that the level was back in line with 2015. </p> <p>\u201cThere was a spike in crime after 23 June. I am pleased to say it has now gone back to levels comparable to last year. We are watching it carefully. We will continue to combat hate crime however we can,\u201d she told MPs.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Dromey said: \u201cPutting race and immigration centre-stage in the referendum campaign in the way that politicians did resulted in a tide of abuse. Immigration will be a dominant issue in the debate on where Britain goes post-Brexit and so we will need a continued focus on the impact this is having in communities.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><strong> <br></strong></p>",

Why did she not bring back selection at 11 years old?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/grammar-schools-social-mobility-theresa-may-early-years\">Grammar schools don\u2019t help social mobility \u2013 we need to start earlier | Melissa Benn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The answer is that Thatcher was wary of political suicide \u2013 at least until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/gallery/2015/mar/28/poll-tax-riots-revisited-in-pictures\" title=\"\">poll tax</a>. When she became education secretary in 1970, she found a poll in her Finchley constituency running at 80% against a return to selection. Plenty of Tories loved grammars, as most had been to them. But since 1944, admission had been by a supposedly objective \u201cintelligence\u201d test, not an academic exam. For the first time, middle-class children were being excluded from their ancestral schools in favour of at least a few \u201cbright\u201d working-class ones.</p> <p>Thatcher\u2019s shadow education predecessor, Edward Boyle, had been roasted at meeting after meeting by furious Tories whose children had \u201cfailed\u201d the 11-plus and found themselves dumped in secondary moderns. Boyle struggled to promise no return to the 11-plus, but it wrecked his career. He was one of Thatcher\u2019s few political friends.</p> <p>The argument was and still is surrounded by mendacious noise. Under selection there is no such thing as parental choice, any more than there could be \u201ca grammar school for all\u201d. But from the 1970s onwards, the politics of state education, at least in the big cities, reflected the striving of some middle-class parents to \u201cget our schools back\u201d.</p> <p>This led ministers of both parties to seek various centrist dodges, from assisted places and city technology colleges to specialist schools, academies and free schools \u2013 all as a means of separating so-called good schools from \u201csink\u201d ones. Each was code for academic and/or social segregation. It was often astronomically expensive. In 2006 Bexley\u2019s new academy was reported to have cost \u00a350m. Michael Gove in 2014 had to raid the school \u201cspecial needs\u201d budget of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/10/gove-lunatic-raid-free-schools\" title=\"\">\u00a3400m for his&#xa0;ailing free schools</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be4730fbb94b36e53255949f8262f276327f873d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be4730fbb94b36e53255949f8262f276327f873d/0_0_3498_4933/709.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher in 1982: \u2018When she became education secretary in 1970, she found a poll in her Barnet constituency running at 80% against a return to selective education.\u2019\" width=\"709\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher in 1982: \u2018When she became education secretary in 1970, she found a poll in her Finchley constituency running at 80% against a return to selective education.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bride Lane Library/Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile entry to these \u201cWhitehall\u201d schools and the 163 remaining grammars&#xa0;(which Thatcher did save) drifted from the theoretical purity of the old 11-plus. Entry tests were made \u201ccrammable\u201d, boosting parental involvement and seeing a cottage industry in tutoring in selective counties such as Kent. The money was worth it. Middle-class parents in Kent now either get into a local grammar or flee to the private sector. Today\u2019s grammar schools are \u201cfee-paying\u201d by a different name.</p> <p>As for the idea that \u201cjust a few\u201d grammar schools would not harm the system, the chief inspector, Michael Wilshaw, could not be more dismissive. He said last week that setting and streaming were one thing, but returning&#xa0;to institutional segregation at 11, \u201cwhere we only expect some kids to do well\u201d, would be disastrous and retrograde. Every grammar school \u201cmeans three secondary moderns, and no one is queueing to go to them\u201d. As a&#xa0;former head of a London comprehensive, he would also have been \u201cabsolutely furious\u201d to find the best 20% of pupils creamed off.</p> <p>Two decades of that favourite ministerial bloodsport, tearing up school structures, has failed to deliver. Alice Sullivan of London\u2019s Institute of Education declares: \u201cThere is no robust evidence that any particular structure \u2026 is beneficial for improving the performance of poor pupils.\u201d Academies do not outperform local authority schools. Some do, some don\u2019t. What happens in the classroom is what matters, not what happens in governors\u2019 meetings.</p> <p>The argument over selection nowadays applies almost exclusively to urban schools, since out-of-town comprehensives are barely controversial. There is usually just one community secondary. But in cities the debate has bite. This is because most parents naturally want their children to go to school with other children (and parents) like themselves. It is a concern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/10/future-conditional-review-rob-brydon-tamsin-oglesby-education\" title=\"\">well satirised</a> in Tamsin Oglesby\u2019s play, Future Conditional, last year at the Old Vic.</p> <p>While such concern is understandable, there is no evidence that a comprehensive system delivers worse results overall \u2013 and clear evidence that, for poor children, selective systems are worse. The reality is that the top end of British secondary education is not at all bad. It is the bottom that is dire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/05/michael-wilshaw-ofsted-chief-grammar-schools-theresa-may-poorer-children\">Ofsted chief warns May over 'retrograde step' of grammar schools</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nor is this a function of the curse of the debate, immigration. The evidence suggests that high-achieving migrants have <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2016/06/02/schools-with-large-numbers-of-eu-students-perform-better/\" title=\"\">led the recovery</a> in London\u2019s schools in recent years. The only coherent answer is to concentrate not on structure but resources. It is teaching, equipment and, above all, leadership that make a difference to a school.</p> <p>The argument about selection is more about social policy than education. Schools financed by the state should be social integrators, not dividers. Grammars are dividers. Gove may have deserved praise for caring about standards, but his ideological obsession with selective free schools and dodgy academies was a disaster.</p> <p>As for faith schools, seeking to replicate in England the religious divisions of Northern Ireland, with Muslims and Christians instead of Catholics and Protestants, must be reckless. These days, faith-based education should be&#xa0;social anathema. And as for currying favour with the Tory right, merely chipping off a few secondary schools and turning them into de facto adjuncts of the private sector cannot make educational or financial sense.</p> <p>The answer must remain with local control \u2013 if not of schools then at least of their intake. Intake is all, because it is the chief determinant of performance.</p> <p>Theresa May is playing with fire. When last year George Osborne attempted to nationalise every school in&#xa0;the land, it was Tory local councils that rose in fury and stopped him. To whom did he think their schools belonged? In an open society, schools are the melting pots of community tension. Their task should be to mitigate local division, not promote it. In the last century, collective secondary education in Britain was a true social advance, a revolution on a par with the Victorians\u2019 education for all. Going backwards should be unthinkable.</p> <p>The prime minister should let this dream pass. Perhaps she should rehearse a more honest slogan than \u201cBring back the grammars\u201d. She should try, \u201cBring back the secondary moderns\u201d. That should wake things up.</p>",

  "<p>Along with other Hispanic education advocates, Ruben Cortez was pleased to discover that Texas might approve a Mexican American studies textbook for use in public schools. </p> <p>Then he read it.</p> <p>The textbook, Mexican American Heritage, is packed with \u201cflagrant falsehoods and offensive racial stereotypes\u201d, the state board of education member told a press conference on Tuesday in Brownsville, near the border with Mexico. \u201cFrankly this sounds like something in line with what you\u2019d hear in the Trump campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Cortez convened an eight-member committee of academics and teachers to examine the book, and they produced a <a href=\"https://mastxeducationdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/ruben-cortezs-ad-hoc-committe-final-report.pdf\">54-page report</a> (pdf) which details what they say are 141 errors of fact, interpretation and omission.</p> <p>\u201cIt is an utter shame that we as policymakers, educational professionals and communities across this great state must deal with this racially offensive and poor attempt at academic work,\u201d Cortez said. \u201cClearly intended to be a political Trojan horse into our schools, this textbook is a complete disaster and this should not even be considered a textbook, rather a political manifesto aimed at distorting the perceptions of our most valuable resources, our children.\u201d</p> <p>The report\u2019s authors accuse the book, by Jaime Riddle and Valarie Angle, of having a \u201cprimary thesis, that Mexican American history reveals major menacing or un-American trends in American history, society and culture\u201d.</p> <p>According to the book, Chicano activists \u201cadopted a revolutionary narrative that opposed western civilization and wanted to destroy this society\u201d. The report\u2019s authors also take exception to a passage that states: \u201cIllegal immigration has \u2026 caused a number of economic and security problems in the United States over which people are divided on how to solve. Poverty, non-assimilation, drugs, crime and exploitation are among some of these problems\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/31/texas-textbook-mexican-american-heritage-public-schools-us-history\">A textbook on Mexican Americans that gets their history wrong?

It quotes a passage: \u201cStereotypically, Mexicans were viewed as lazy compared to European or American workers. Industrialists were very driven, competitive men who were always on the clock and continually concerned about efficiency.</p> <p>\u201cThey were used to their workers putting in a full day\u2019s work, quietly and obediently, and respecting rules, authority and property. In contrast, Mexican laborers were not reared to put in a full day\u2019s work so vigorously. There was a cultural attitude of \u2018ma\u00f1ana,\u2019 or \u2018tomorrow\u2019, when it came to high-gear production. It was also traditional to skip work on Mondays, and drinking on the job could be a problem.\u201d </p> <p>The publisher, Virginia-based Momentum Instruction, is run by Cynthia Dunbar, who served a four-year term on the state education board and wrote a book in 2008, One Nation Under God, subtitled How the Left is Trying to Erase What Made Us Great, which described public education as a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.chron.com/life/houston-belief/article/Educator-ripped-for-her-book-criticizing-public-1760631.php\">subtly deceptive tool of perversion</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Dunbar said that the part about \u201clazy\u201d Mexicans had been misinterpreted by the book\u2019s detractors. \u201cThat was a racial bias and stereotype that was being put forward by industrialists and the book was exposing that, that was something that they were having to confront and overcome,\u201d she told the Guardian. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no hidden agenda in the textbook, there\u2019s no bias, there\u2019s no stigma that\u2019s trying to be put forward, we\u2019re trying to work with as many people as possible to make sure that if there\u2019s any language that\u2019s confusing, or could be edited, that we do that. But for some reason these people are more concerned with doing press conferences than they are with actually submitting statements of objective factual errors to us to correct. There\u2019s no racial bias in the textbook, I don\u2019t know why they keep twisting it to try to put it forward.\u201d</p> <p>She said that only one factual error has been noted by a state review panel \u2013 a sentence that seemed to imply that the US\u2019s official language is English, when the country has no official language \u2013 and that that the authors were well qualified to research and write a wide-ranging book on the subject.</p> <p>Cortez, a Democrat, said that just over half of the roughly five million children in Texas public schools are Hispanic. The board of education will hold a public hearing next Tuesday before deciding whether to adopt the textbook in November.</p> <p>The production and adoption of Texas textbooks has long been freighted with political and cultural controversies that have intensified in recent years as the 15-strong board has become dominated by conservatives who, critics say, have sought to promote their rightwing views on topics such as religion, climate change, capitalism and America\u2019s creation.</p> <p>In 2015, after an outcry promoted by a Houston-area mother\u2019s online critique, a publisher revised a passage in a geography book that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/05/mcgraw-hill-textbook-slaves-workers-texas\">described</a> African slaves brought to the US as immigrant \u201cworkers\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Mary Lou Bruner \u2013 who asserted that the twentysomething Barack Obama was a drug-taking male prostitute, pre-kindergarten programmes are a federal plot to promote gay marriage and the Democratic party killed John F Kennedy \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/24/texas-board-of-education-election-conservatives-public-schools-curriculum\">almost won the Republican nomination</a> for one of the seats on the board.</p>",
  "<p>Build a wall \u2026 A great wall. But will it be high enough, big enough, thick enough? Will it be Trump-size, visible from space? Will it keep out the undesirables ? Will it protect the lorry drivers and nervous holidaymakers? Will it look nice if we put a few plants around it? Are the French going to raze the Jungle to the ground just as they did Sangatte?</p> <p>I do not know whether Robert Goodwill, the immigration minister who announced the grand folly of a \u00a31.9m wall in Calais \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/uk-immigration-minister-confirms-work-will-begin-on-big-new-wall-in-calais\">\u201cWe\u2019ve done the fences, now we are doing a wall\u201d</a> \u2013 has a clue what he is talking about but this is part of a \u00a317m security package that \u201cwe\u201d are partaking in with the French to tackle the problem of the camp in Calais. This is the ultimate in closed thinking.</p> <p>Walls, barriers, boundaries, borders, blockades: these are structures that make us feel in control, but in the end remind us only of chaos. This is part of the Brexit mentality, part but not all. There is another part that means opening up to a world beyond Europe and righteous Remainers should be wary of constructing even more walls around their own arguments, which seem to outdo each other in convincing us that everything will be terrible for ever.</p> <p>The result of this on the left \u2013 except among those with a vivid enough imagination to actually envisage Jeremy Corbyn shambling down the G20 red carpet in China \u2013 is political paralysis. No more pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will, but pessimism about everything. This a truly dangerous place to be. I understand the feeling: the world is going to hell in a handcart, so there is nothing to be done. It is a form of paralysis solved only by moving to places where nothing ever happens: New Zealand, Canada \u2026 Failing that, we make little walls around ourselves. Cosy up as the nights draw in and try not to think. About anything. </p> <p>Strangely, though, the best cure for such a feeling is the opposite. It is getting involved with people who do work to change the lives of others, who make movement possible, whose very work is to pull down barriers not erect them.</p> <p>This was made clear to me by Undocumented, an <a href=\"https://www.doctorsoftheworld.org.uk/blog/entry/undocumented-photo-exhibition-marks-10-years-of-london-clinic\">exhibition celebrating 10 years of a Bethnal Green clinic run by Doctors of the World</a> which is used by migrants locked out of the healthcare system. In reality, everyone in the UK should be able to access healthcare. One of the myths is that this is what people come here for. The reality is that, if you are homeless and don\u2019t have a national insurance number, you can\u2019t access it.</p> <p>Sarah (pictured above) explained this to me. She is from South Africa where she had been <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/crisis-in-south-africa-the-shocking-practice-of-corrective-rape-aimed-at-curing-lesbians-9033224.html\">\u201ccorrectionally\u201d raped</a>. Men, she said, had come to \u201cfix\u201d her because of her sexuality. She became pregnant and HIV positive. She could not get a GP but the clinic helped her. And there she was, beaming in front of photographs of herself despite her horrific story. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d99349556fb77b56bd4d4dfb462499b9208213d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d99349556fb77b56bd4d4dfb462499b9208213d2/0_172_1181_709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ibrahim Doctors of the World\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ibrahim, a former Doctors of the World service user who is now training to practise as UK GP.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Coulson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A man, Ibrahim Muyhayer, who was a doctor in the Sudanese army but had to leave because of the political volatility, told me how it had taken him five years to access the system. He was charged \u00a32,000 for an ultrasound scan for his pregnant wife though he was earning \u00a350 a week. Now he volunteers in the clinic and is retraining to practise as a doctor here.</p> <p>This basic ethos of treating medical need, whatever the patient\u2019s immigration status, is what this charity does. This is why it also runs clinics in Calais and works with refugees in Greece.</p> <p>Users of the clinic often carry stories of awful suffering, torture, loss and rape, but this is the only service providing primary healthcare. Tearing down the barriers. It was the same in Calais. Unlike the immigration minister, I have been to the camps. It would take him an hour to get there. It\u2019s incredible that he has not. Anyone who has actually talked to anyone in the Jungle, or worse, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/28/msf-to-open-first-humanitarian-standard-refugee-camp-near-dunkirk\">Grande-Synthe, the camp in Dunkirk</a>, would smell the desperation. Every night, these people risk getting their hands ripped up, breaking their limbs and getting teargassed trying to get over the fences because they feel that they have no life anyway. They will get around a wall.</p> <p>So this wall is a symbolic gesture to be built with taxpayers\u2019 money. That money could surely be used to fund centres for the processing of asylum claims. But something unforgivable is happening when we cannot even let in the unaccompanied children from the camps. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/disgrace-to-europe-former-child-refugee-lord-dubs-calais-camp\">Stella Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, went over with Alf Dubs to try and do something about this.</a> Those kids, with their strange \u201cprotectors\u201d lurking behind them, haunt me. These are traumatised children, left to rot and be exploited. The volunteers do the best they can, but the situation is at breaking point.</p> <p>Nevertheless, to hear the stories of those who have been helped, is to be jolted out of political ennui. Lives can be rebuilt.</p> <p>A wall is sign of a failure of humanity. In 1964, the artist Joseph Beuys satirised the Berlin wall, suggesting it be raised by 5cm to have better proportions. He made his point and we know what happened to that wall. It is good to be reminded that there are those who build walls but there are those who will build ladders over them. That is called hope.</p>",

  "<p>It has been a bad few months for Islamic State (Isis). For the first time since the terror group laid claim to much of Iraq and Syria, it no longer has a direct path to Europe. Black flags are no longer flying over towns and villages near the Turkish border and the militants of the so-called caliphate are on the run. If the decay continues, Isis will soon lose much of its remaining foothold in Syria. Its last bastion will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/09/life-under-isis-raqqa-mosul-giant-prison-syria-iraq\">Raqqa</a> and the north-eastern deserts, where it all began for the group\u2019s latest incarnation in April 2013, and from where much of its subsequent rampage was plotted.</p> <p>Since mid-July, Isis has been methodically pushed from towns and villages it controlled near the Turkish frontier by the most concerted ground advance of the past two years. The jihadist group now looks to be far less of a threat to the regional order than when its leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi\">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a>, proclaimed his rule over a swath of eastern Syria and western Iraq in mid-2014.</p> <p>But little about what comes next is clear.

And, in the eyes of many European governments, its danger has metastasised into a global threat that a loss of land won\u2019t mitigate. A military victory over one of modern history\u2019s most savage band of marauders may yet prove pyrrhic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7730faf80e97e4fd0664ad4d8afe4a891d9637eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7730faf80e97e4fd0664ad4d8afe4a891d9637eb/0_4_2262_1357/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isis fighters parade through Raqqa after its capture in June 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isis fighters parade through Raqqa after its capture in June 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Isis once controlled a stretch from the town of al-Bab in the Aleppo hinterland to Mosul in northern Iraq. It regularly moved men between the two points, using Turkey, not far north, as a supply line for fighters, money and food. From this arc of influence, it created a bulwark against threats from the outside, and a self-sustaining society built on oil revenues, taxes and loot seized from vanquished Iraqi and Syrian forces.</p> <p>Within months of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/10/iraq-sunni-insurgents-islamic-militants-seize-control-mosul\">seizing Iraq\u2019s second biggest city, Mosul</a>, in June 2014, Isis had splintered the authority of embattled leaders on both sides of the now-irrelevant border between Iraq and Syria and created a terrifying new form of governance, rooted in an uncompromising reading of Islamic tenets and unchecked savagery. Isis leaders lorded over their gateways such as Manbij and Jarabulus, along the Turkish frontier.

They forced people to work with them.\u201d</p> <p>In Manbij, as soon as the jihadists fled, local women stripped off full-face coverings and black gowns that had been mandatory under Isis. Schools that had been shuttered were soon being swept out and reopened. People started to smoke again. Men cut off their beards. To do so while the jihadists were there would have led to a flogging \u2013 or worse. In Jarabulus, the ubiquitous black banner that had been painted over government buildings was whitewashed. Markets opened and people again mingled.</p> <p>\u201cIsis used Jarabulus as a starting point for its operations in Turkey,\u201d says Hamdan. \u201cThey used the mosques to advocate brutal killings, which became the dominant theme in recent months.

It spread after Isis realised it was going to lose a significant part of strategic territory. Most of the people, whether pro-Isis or not, withdrew from the city towards Maskanah and al-Tabqa and then to Raqqa.\u201d</p> <p>These areas amount to the last redoubt of Isis in Syria and will be the targets of a push later this year. Who gets to do the fighting is, as yet, unclear. The link to the Iraqi strongholds of al-Bukamal, Ba\u2019ej, Tal Afar and Mosul remains viable for now, but in Iraq, as in Syria, the self-styled caliphate is rapidly contracting.</p> <p>In Iraq, an assault on Mosul, which has previously been deemed too difficult, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/14/kurdish-peshmerga-forces-fresh-push-recapture-mosul-isis-iraq\">now being seen as a reality</a> for early next year. Iraqi forces that fled as the jihadists advanced have been reconfigured and galvanised. \u201cConfidence has emerged from battlefield gains,\u201d says a Baghdad-based US diplomat. \u201cAnd while the Iraqis are feeling better about themselves, Isis is feeling worse. Everywhere they have tried to make a stand in recent times, they have been hosed out.

Control of territory, so vital in the heady early days, is no longer as important to Baghdadi and his senior leaders as controlling populations beyond the caliphate\u2019s fast-shrinking boundaries. \u201cThey have highly intelligent leaders calling the shots, being prepared to sacrifice thousands of lessers who are far less disciplined about how they get around and communicate,\u201d says one western diplomat.</p> <p>Another Isis observer, a security official, says: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that they have sent people to Europe. We know that they expect some to be caught and they accept that. They have others on the way, or already in place.\u201d</p> <p>The Paris and Brussels plotters returned to Europe after being trained between al-Bab and Raqqa by an Isis cell that had been tasked with causing chaos in the west. Both cells were sent across the border into Turkey and then on a painstaking journey through the continent, tailored to avoid detection.</p> <p>Another Isis figure, a petty criminal from the south-west London suburb of Hammersmith, was also sent on his way to Europe around the same time. His name was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/07/londoner-alexanda-kotey-identified-member-isis-group-jihadi-john\">Aine Lesley Davis</a>, and he was one of a trio of British nationals who brutalised western hostages in Syria in 2013 and 2014.

This week, a Turkish prosecutor released an indictment on Davis, which accused him of crossing the border near Jarabulus and linking with two senior Turkish members of Isis. \u201cTo cross into Turkey, he communicated with \u0130lhami Bal\u0131 (code name Abu Baker) and Necip S\u00fcleyman (Abu Sham Al Ansari), Isis Turkey border \u2018emirs\u2019,\u201d the indictment read. \u201cBal\u0131\u2019s name is linked to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/10/turkey-suicide-bomb-killed-in-ankara\">Ankara attack in October 2015</a>, which killed more than 100 people.\u201d</p> <p>Emwazi was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/13/us-officials-reasonably-certain-that-raqqa-strike-killed-mohammed-emwazi\">killed by a CIA drone strike</a> in Raqqa five days after Davis was arrested in Istanbul. Kotey\u2019s whereabouts remain unknown. And while security officials in Europe believe that much of Isis\u2019s original foreign fighter corps has been killed \u2013 they were seen as dispensable by their leaders \u2013 several hundred have returned to Europe, where they are awaiting instructions from inside Syria and Iraq.</p> <p>\u201cThat, in a sense, is the reason why it doesn\u2019t really matter if they lose this land right now,\u201d says the western diplomat. \u201cThey are an even more potent threat than they were a year ago.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6873218747cc60e0e4476e45a1f685f92c0febc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6873218747cc60e0e4476e45a1f685f92c0febc/0_137_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Armed police in Paris during terrorist attack\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Could the west be a renewed target after a refocus on terrorist atrocities by Isis?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malte Christians/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The calculation by Isis leaders is that acolytes, fired by some sense of divine purpose, will launch their own attacks, without direct instruction or organisation. Such strikes are increasingly valuable, and damaging to the caliphate\u2019s foes. They are relatively easy to commit, and very difficult to detect.</p> <p>Though fast losing ground, and with morale low in many of their embattled communities, Isis leaders continue to believe that the organisation which first rose out of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 derives considerable potency from Sunni Muslim resentment. The Isis narrative is that Sunnis, the majority Islamic sect, have been stripped of power and influence by western powers who have handed the reins to the minority Shias. They anchor their very contemporary political gripes in an ancient creed, which says that much of this was preordained.</p> <p>An essential sell for Isis leaders to would-be jihadists such as Davis, Kotey and Emwazi is that their generation has the privilege to not only correct recent indignities, but to restore the lost glories of Islam. The withering caliphate is becoming the latest <em>casus belli</em> \u2013 a divine mission to replace the \u201cfalsehood\u201d of the nation state with Islamic rule being stripped away by yet more western aggression.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"df6302a61ba2160e936615f06a6842dce0bfca3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df6302a61ba2160e936615f06a6842dce0bfca3e/0_10_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turkish workers with some of the modular blocks that will form the wall along the Syrian border\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turkish workers with some of the modular blocks that will form the wall along the Syrian border.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How that aggression takes shape in the coming months will be pivotal to the direction of the war against the jihadists \u2013 and the overall course of the Syrian war. The campaign against Isis had been fought mostly as a subset of the broader war, but has been increasingly drawn into the main conflict.</p> <p>For now, Turkey\u2019s role will continue to be instrumental, its aim \u2013 to keep two Kurdish cantons separated by a 140km (90-mile) gap, in which Arab groups call the shots \u2013 now within reach. Accused of being too slow to react to the threat from Isis, whose ranks were reinforced largely through the then-porous Turkish border, Ankara is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/23/turkey-syria-border-reinforced-suruc-suicide-attack\">building a wall</a> along much of it.</p> <p>In Iraq, Isis now has just as much trouble securing supply lines outside its strongholds. The border with Syria remains a free-for-all, but offers little to increasingly desperate fighters seeking refuge or escape. The desert frontiers of Saudi Arabia and Jordan are better policed and even more foreboding.</p> <p>\u201cMorale is desperate,\u201d one Isis official tells the Guardian. \u201cEven in Raqqa. But they are very smart. They have made plans for all of this. They are investing a lot in sending their people to Europe, and it won\u2019t be over soon. You\u2019ve seen them throughout their history. Whenever they are being beaten, they lay low. They will come back later.

His father was a Jewish scrap metal dealer who numbered among his acquaintances Jewish gangsters such as Moe Dalitz and Shondor \u201cThe Bull\u201d Birns. Growing up on Cleveland\u2019s west side, Heller grew accustomed to defending himself against attacks by antisemitic gangs. After serving in the US army, he earned a business degree at the University of Southern California.</p> <p>He entered the music industry by working as a road manager and booking agent, then, in partnership with Ben Fischel, opened the Heller-Fischel Agency in Beverly Hills. One of its employees was a young Irving Azoff, future manager of the Eagles and chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/05/business/media/irving-azoff-starts-new-entertainment-business.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Azoff MSG Entertainment</a>. The company amassed a client roster that included many of the biggest names of the day, including the Who, Grand Funk Railroad and Black Sabbath. Heller bought out Fischel\u2019s share of the company and continued to handle major names including Pink Floyd, Kraftwerk, Journey and REO Speedwagon. However, Heller\u2019s fortunes subsequently declined, and the mid-80s saw him living with his parents in Encino, California.</p> <p>His fateful meeting with Eazy-E (real name Eric Wright) came after he had begun working with Los Angeles hip-hop artists at the Macola label in Hollywood. Heller was well aware of the incongruity of being a middle-aged, white Jewish American in the midst of LA\u2019s black youth culture, but it did not cramp his style. With a local impresario, Alonzo Williams, he managed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Class_Wreckin%27_Cru\" title=\"\">World Class Wreckin\u2019 Cru</a>, which included the future NWA members Dr Dre and DJ Yella, and the trio CIA, featuring Ice Cube, who would also join NWA.</p> <p>Eazy-E was so keen to meet Heller, with his fabled music business success, that he paid Williams $750 to make the introduction. Heller was instantly smitten with Eazy-E\u2019s debut single, Boyz-n-the-Hood, and the pair set about planning a future for the artist and their new label venture, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruthless_Records\" title=\"\">Ruthless Records</a>. Heller stumped up $250,000 for a 20% share of the business. \u201cRight from that very first time I heard Boyz-n-the-Hood, I just knew that somehow I was in the right place at the right time,\u201d Heller told <a href=\"http://grantland.com/features/jerry-heller-nwa-straight-outta-compton/\" title=\"\">the Grantland website last year</a>. According to Heller\u2019s book, Ruthless: A Memoir (2006), Eazy told him: \u201cYou were the first white guy I ever really talked to who wasn\u2019t trying to collect rent or arrest me.\u201d</p> <p>In the slipstream of NWA\u2019s powerhouse success, Ruthless enjoyed a searing streak of hits into the mid-90s with such artists as Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, JJ Fad and <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/michelle-hip-hop-tv-movie-thinkfactory-1201611772/\" title=\"\">Michel\u2019le</a>. The label notched up 11 Top&#xa0;40 albums on the Billboard 200 chart between 1989 and 1995, with NWA\u2019s Efil4zaggin and Bone Thugs\u2019 E.\u20091999 Eternal both reaching No&#xa0;1. \u201cNext to David Geffen, we built the biggest empire in the history of the music business,\u201d Heller said.</p> <p>However, the violent and volatile climate surrounding gangsta rap took its toll. In 1989 Ice Cube quit NWA to pursue a solo career, claiming he had been deprived of his fair share of royalties. He vented his spleen against the manager in his song No Vaseline (1991), which became notorious for its antisemitic content.</p> <p>Then NWA\u2019s production mastermind Dr Dre quit the group, again claiming to have been short-changed by Heller, and signed to Suge Knight\u2019s Death Row label. It was later <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7495967/jerry-heller-early-nwa-manager-dies-at-75\" title=\"\">claimed that Eazy-E </a>had been persuaded to let Dre, the DOC and Michel\u2019le out of their contracts with Ruthless by a visit from Knight and some hired help brandishing lead pipes and baseball bats. Heller responded to the threat by enlisting the assistance of the Jewish Defence League, a rightwing group dedicated to protecting Jews from antisemitism. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that high-reward businesses are also high-risk businesses,\u201d Heller told Hip-Hop Connection magazine in 2007. \u201cPeople don\u2019t just give you money \u2026 Sooner or later you have to deal with these things.\u201d</p> <p>In 1995 Eazy-E died from complications of Aids, though not before he had allegedly fired Heller, who once commented that \u201cEazy was like my flesh-and-blood son\u201d. Ruthless Records was taken over by Eazy\u2019s widow, Tomica Woods-Wright, but its artists drifted away and Ruthless was absorbed into Epic Records. Heller and Woods-Wright sued each other over financial issues surrounding the label, but settled out of court in 1999.</p> <p>Heller subsequently dabbled in several musical ventures, which included launching the <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/04/entertainment/ca-30394\" title=\"\">Hit A Lick Records</a> label, which specialised in Latino rappers.</p> <p>His book, Ruthless, offered some vivid insights into the growth of the West Coast gangsta rap scene and firmly responded to claims of financial misconduct that had been made against him.

It was almost as if he was making a point of ignoring Owen Smith\u2019s email instructing him to lead with Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe.</p> <p>May couldn\u2019t believe her luck and clumsily shoe-horned the gags she had prepared for harder questions into her non-answers. Her escape was only temporary, though, as she was forced on to the back foot by the SNP\u2019s Angus Robertson, who wanted to know whether Britain would remain part of the single market. She glanced at her notes. \u201cREMEMBER NOT TO SAY BREXIT MEANS BREXIT\u201d. Written in capitals.</p> <p>\u201cBrexit means...\u201d she began, before pausing. What did it mean if it didn\u2019t mean Brexit? No. She couldn\u2019t allow herself to think that way. She must try to stifle her natural tendency towards honesty and transparency. She started again. \u201cIt would not be right to give a running commentary on our Brexit. I know this is exactly the opposite of what the minister for Brexit promised you all on Monday, but that only goes to show how much progress we have made with our Brexit negotiations over the course of two days.</p> <p>\u201cThe relationship with Europe that we will be getting is a very special one that I can\u2019t tell you about right now because I haven\u2019t got a clue what it will look like. But I can promise you that it won\u2019t be a Norwegian relationship because we are not Norwegians. </p> <p>\u201cIt will be a very special British relationship, which will be ours and ours alone and, once I have spent the next two years failing to get what I want, I will tell you what I have reluctantly settled for. Trust me on this, though. You\u2019re wanting it. You\u2019re loving it. You\u2019re getting it.\u201d</p> <p>If May appeared somewhat taken aback when she eventually realised that many MPs were openly laughing at her, she looked abject when Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin leapt to her rescue. \u201cI feel more confident now about the future of the UK than at any other time in my life,\u201d he announced. Jenkin is one of those politicians with the unerring knack of being wrong about almost everything. So when he\u2019s feeling good, it\u2019s time for the rest of us to panic.</p> <p>There was no let-up when the prime minister moved on to her G20 statement. \u201cIt would not be right for me to give a running commentary on our Brexit negotiations,\u201d she said, more than happy to repeat herself. While it wasn\u2019t right to give a running commentary on her Brexit negotiations, it was perfectly in order to give a running commentary on why she wouldn\u2019t be giving a running commentary. \u201cAnd not giving a running commentary was the process I took into the G20.</p> <p>\u201cBut let me say this. I am delighted to say that Mexico and Singapore are very quite keen to do a trade deal with us at some unspecified time in the future and that when the Australians say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/g20-theresa-may-warns-of-tough-times-for-uk-economy-after-brexit\">they are going to put the UK at the back of the queue</a> behind the EU, what they really mean is we are at the top of their thoughts and prayers. And by the way, I did whisper something about steel dumping when I was in the toilet so nobody can say I wasn\u2019t tough with the Chinese.\u201d</p> <p>Most MPs had hoped May might have had a little more to show for her jaunt to China and several tried to tease out a few more details about what Brexit deals were in the offing. \u201cI understand that you don\u2019t want to give away any sensitive information,\u201d said Conservative Anna Soubry. \u201cBut could you at least tell us some of the principles that will underlie the negotiations?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper tried another tack. \u201cWithout giving away any sensitive information, could you give us an idea of the values that will inform the negotiations?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>No principles. No values. No progress. No clue.</p>",

  "<p></p> <p>I had gone to Mexico to try to escape.

Then she sent me this message.\u201d She handed me her phone so I could read it.<br></p> <p></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>STAY AWAY FROM HER...She is a wolf in sheeps\u2019 clothing and has no conscience</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWARNING \u2013 Laurie Gough = WARNING!\u201d it began.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the people around you is author Laurie Gough. She seems like a nice person at first-but actually she is a toxic person under a silver tongued mask. Laurie Gough is a secretly sadistic narcissistic person who tries to get others to commit suicide. STAY AWAY FROM HER...She is a wolf in sheeps\u2019 clothing and has no conscience.\u201d</p> <p>Oh God, I thought. Not again.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>It had started two months before, back home in Canada. On my <a href=\"http://www.lauriegough.com\">website</a>, I\u2019d written briefly about my upcoming memoir about my son\u2019s struggle with OCD and soon after, the messages started coming: threats to keep me away from my son, warnings to loved ones, and finally, personal attacks.</p> <p>I first heard from this person in May. The principal of my son\u2019s school called to say she\u2019d received a strange and disturbing email from a stranger named \u201cAna Petruleasa\u201d. The email contained not only my son\u2019s full name, but our address, and it took an even more eerie twist when it continued with a piece of writing cut and pasted (I soon discovered with a simple Google search) from Psychology Today on narcissistic personality disorder, or NPD. My name was awkwardly inserted into the article between brackets, replacing the word \u201cnarcissist\u201d or \u201cnarcissistic\u201d.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With young children, the &lt;Laurie Gough&gt; parent is experienced as unpredictable and confusing. After all, &lt;Laurie Gough people&gt; are awfully difficult to understand for adults, so just imagine how confusing the capricious &lt;Laurie Gough&gt; is in the eyes of a young child!.... A person with &lt;Laurie Gough disorder&gt; will be two-faced; charming and polite in public, while critical, rude, arrogant, sarcastic and passive/aggressive in private; usually to the people who are closest to her.</p> </blockquote> <p>As the principal read me the email, I could feel my heart ricocheting around my ribcage. What did any of this mean? How could someone make such cruel and ludicrous assumptions, especially when my husband Rob and I had spent every waking moment three years prior trying to help our son battle OCD and restore him to the boy he\u2019d been? The thought that anyone could think of my actions as capricious or arrogant cut right through me. My book hadn\u2019t even been released yet. None of it made sense.<br></p> <p>When I Googled the name \u201cAna Petruleasa\u201d, the only hit was the Facebook page of a young woman with cantaloupe breasts spilling out of her T-shirt. It contained the same Gmail address as the message sent to the principal. Was this Ana real? Could this young attractive woman really behind the threatening messages?</p> <p>Not long after the principal\u2019s message, Rob received an anonymous email saying that I was having an affair. Among its highlights was this nugget: \u201cYou appear to have a loving marriage but you are being abused by a predator.\u201d It was written to an old work email address of his that someone could have easily found online. Rob works in IT and when he tried to find the email\u2019s source (not a Gmail address this time), he found a server that was impossible to trace. Someone was going to a lot of trouble to stay hidden.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I began receiving fake-looking Facebook friend requests. I deleted them all.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That evening I decided to go through all of my Facebook friends to find people I didn\u2019t know personally or at least with whom I didn\u2019t share many mutual friends. I found a few suspicious profiles and deleted them. Immediately afterwards, I began receiving fake-looking Facebook friend requests. I deleted them all.<br></p> <p>Friends out in the real world assured me that that anonymous Facebook requesting was on the rise and there was probably nothing to worry about. At this point, I didn\u2019t think that the messages sent to Rob and the school meant I had a cyberstalker. The messages had stopped, and I was getting ready to attend the program in Mexico. I posted about it on my website. I realize now that anyone who wanted to know where I was going to be in July could have easily found out.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>But that\u2019s the thing about having a cyberstalker: they don\u2019t need to track you down. They\u2019re already everywhere.</p> <p>After I read Egly\u2019s message at the restaurant in Mexico, I wanted answers. I wrote her from a friend\u2019s Facebook account: \u201cWho are you? Nothing you\u2019re writing makes sense. Stop immediately or you\u2019ll go to jail.\u201d</p> <p>Nothing happened for three days. Then Egly, or whoever hides behind Egly\u2019s profile, responded:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Wow - results of our Laurie Gough facebook message are superior to what we expected. All we wanted to do was warn people about a covert -repeat COVERT - evil narcissist person - but now far more people know than we were able to reach originally...Follow what happens to Laurie Gough in the future and buy her upcoming book, \u201cStolen Child\u201d It will not say that Laurie herself caused her unfortunate son\u2019s OCD. After the triumphant success here, let\u2019s take the show on the road to protect more people... You can show this message to Laurie and also to every man named \u201cRob\u201d in Wakefield Canada if they want to read it.</p> </blockquote> <p>I read these words on my phone as I walked along a narrow sidewalk beside a busy San Miguel street. The sentences blurred before my eyes. I felt unclean. Did the Mexican people passing by think I was this vile person too? The family on the motor scooter? The old lady selling gorditas at the curbside? Even though I knew the cyberstalker\u2019s words were inane, he or she was creating a chilling version of me in cyberspace, one that people who didn\u2019t know me might actually believe. How far would this person go? Would the stalker write similar things on my book\u2019s Amazon page? Would the stalker hack my computer, email all my friends, hijack my accounts, steal my identity, blanket reading groups with nonstop napalm about me? </p> <p>Would the stalker show up at my door?</p> <p>I decided to let all my Facebook friends know that I had a cyberstalker to make sure they hadn\u2019t received any suspicious messages about me. Getting the word out seemed my best defense. They suggested I contact the police, which I did.</p> <p>My best friend, who lives in Montreal, was already on the case, sleuthing long hours into the night, asking me for more details. She thought the latest message sounded as if it had gone through Google Translate.</p> <p>I was also spending long nights looking for clues \u2013 trying to make sense of this person\u2019s obsession with me. The stalked had become the stalker. On Egly\u2019s Facebook page I saw that she\u2019d friended the San Miguel Literary Sala, the program I joined in Mexico. When I clicked on her \u201clikes\u201d I inhaled a sudden breath. She\u2019d \u201cliked\u201d almost everything I had.</p> <p>The next evening, I sat with another writer, Tad. I showed him the messages and explained what I was going through. Tad\u2019s observation shook me.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a man,\u201d Tad said. </p> <p>All along I\u2019d been thinking of this person as a woman, not only because the profiles were of women, but because I\u2019d interpreted the messages to read in a kind of bullying \u201cmean girl\u201d tone. But the profiles my stalker created (Ana Petruleasa and Egly Hidalgo) both looked like porn actors. A man\u2019s ideal woman. Maybe Tad was right. Maybe behind the cleavage, there was a man sitting in a basement somewhere, tracking down my friends and writing threatening messages about me. A tickle of fear rose up my spine at the thought. </p> <p>\u201cBut why would this guy go to all this trouble?\u201d I could hardly choke out the words. Suddenly I felt very cold. Everyone else in the bar seemed to be erupting into laughter, their lives untouched by madmen.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not trouble for him. He\u2019s on a mission to warn the world about you and destroy you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPass the limes,\u201d I said. \u201cI need some tequila.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>What I\u2019ve come to believe is that my stalker was once a Facebook friend, a stranger whose request I unwittingly accepted. That\u2019s how he or she had access to enough information to figure out where my son goes to school. Maybe I misremembered a former colleague or a university friend? Maybe the stalker emailed me, pretending to be a fan or a potential client wanting my editing services.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How do I know what I\u2019ve experienced so far isn\u2019t just a prelude of worse to come?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019ve always assumed my readers out there are friendly, curious, like-minded. But in our digital world \u2013 where it\u2019s almost effortless to be anonymous as opposed to 25 years ago when it was nearly impossible \u2013 something seems to have shifted in the human psyche.

  "<p>At the end of the longest stage of the Tour of Britain, also the day with the highest volume of climbing, a mass finish sprint was unexpected and unpredictable. Dylan Groenewegen, the Dutch national champion, held off this year\u2019s sprint discovery, Daniel McLay, with Ben Swift also in the mix as the two leading sprinters in the race, Mark Cavendish and Andr\u00e9 Greipel, went missing at vital moments.</p> <p>Cavendish\u2019s legs gave out as the action hotted up in the Welsh hills 33km from the finish, although the Manxman was within a few hundred metres of regaining contact on the run-in. Greipel survived an initial sort-out that left a much reduced lead peloton in contention but was poorly placed when the leaders hit the key corner with 600 metres to go, a right-hand turn off the A470 main road into the Royal Welsh Showground, after which a series of tight turns made it impossible to move up.</p> <p>Groenewegen received the perfect lead-out through the sequence of four bends from his team-mate, Tom Leezer, with McLay and Swift tucked in behind.</p> <p>McLay was unable to get past once the LottoNL-Jumbo rider began his final effort, although the 24-year-old reiterated the progress he has made this season as he closed to within a wheel as Groenewegen took his seventh win of the season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/picture/2016/sep/07/sport-picture-of-the-day-tour-of-britain-riders-take-on-the-cheshire-hills\">Sport picture of the day: Tour of Britain riders take on the Cheshire hills</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was really tough today, such a long stage with a lot of climbing,\u201d said Groenewegen. \u201cI had a small chance of staying with the bunch but I did it. It was a hard finale but I had four riders from the team there to work for me.\u201d</p> <p>It was a result that did not alter the overall standings, where the Belgian Julien Vermote still leads by 6sec from Steve Cummings, although Swift and Tony Gallopin fought hard for time bonuses that may affect the final pecking order when the race finishes in London on Sunday.</p> <p>With a light breeze from the south to slow the peloton down, the stage stretched to close on six hours. The time in the saddle made itself felt in the finale through Llanidloes and Rhayader after the end of an early four-man escape including the Welsh rider Rob Partridge from the local team NFTO, who are based just over the border in Hereford, the Italian Alessandro Tonelli and Caja Rural\u2019s Miguel \u00c1ngel D\u00edaz.</p> <p>The Spaniard began the stage just under five minutes behind Vermote, meaning the quartet was never given too much latitude. Vermote\u2019s Etixx-Quickstep team had been speculating about relinquishing the race lead, due to the difficulty of controlling the race with a team reduced in numbers after the loss of the young American Adrien Costa, but fortunately one of their three domestiques is the former world time-trial champion Tony Martin and the need did not arise.</p> <p>Once the peloton had initially regrouped 40km from the finish, Cavendish and other weaker climbers were eliminated as Team Sky and Cannondal-Drapac put on the pressure. Greipel lost contact briefly and there were repeated splits at the front featuring challengers for the overall standings in Daniel Martin and Gallopin, but once the flatter main road after Rhayader had been reached, with Greipel, Groenewegen and a plethora of their team-mates still in contact \u2013 albeit far from comfortable \u2013 the sprint loomed.</p> <p>On Thursday, a blanket finish again looks likely although the 200km through the Welsh Valleys, the Forest of Dean and the Cotswolds are not to be taken lightly.

  "<p>A 79-year-old monarch is perhaps not the most likely person to deliver a rousing speech in support of refugees, religious tolerance, diversity and LGBT rights, and a royal garden party may not be the most likely place to hear it.</p> <p>But an impassioned five-minute address on the need for inclusiveness and acceptance by Norway\u2019s King Harald last week to 1,500 slightly startled \u2013 but ultimately delighted \u2013 guests in the park of the Royal Palace in Oslo has gone viral.</p> <p>A spokeswoman, Marianne Hagen, said the palace had received a huge number of requests for an official English translation of the speech, which had received nearly 80,000 likes and been viewed <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nrknyheter/videos/10154056444941715/\">more than 3m times on Facebook</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvB0jZKRKrk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zvB0jZKRKrk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>King Harald\u2019s speech, with English subtitles.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Interest in the speech has been such that Harald, who celebrated 25 years on the Norwegian throne earlier this year, was quizzed about it at length during a state visit to Finland this week, Hagen said.</p> <p>Explicitly backing gay rights, the king, who will be 80 in February, said Norwegians were \u201cgirls who love girls, boys who love boys, and girls and boys who love each other\u201d. He also voiced support for religious diversity, saying Norwegians believed \u201cin God, in Allah, in the universe \u2013 and in nothing\u201d.</p> <p>Calling on people to embrace \u201ctrust, solidarity and generosity\u201d, he said the notion of home could not be confined within national borders. \u201cIt is not always easy to say where we are from, what nationality we are. Home is where our heart is.\u201d<br></p> <p>Norwegians came, the king continued, in all ages, abilities, heights, family statuses and careers, just as their musical tastes varied from Edvard Grieg to DJ Kygo. \u201cIn other words,\u201d he said. \u201cNorway is you. Norway is us.\u201d</p> <p>Rightwing, anti-immigration rhetoric has been mounting in Norway since the election three years ago of a centre-right coalition that has been widely criticised for trying to deport asylum seekers to Russia and last month suggested erecting a fence along the two countries\u2019 Arctic border. <br></p> <p>The Nordic nation of 5 million is struggling to integrate an estimated 30,000 asylum seekers who arrived last year, including 5,500, most of them Syrian, who rode bikes across from Russia.<br></p> <p>Harald insisted Norwegians came not only \u201cfrom north Norway, central Norway, southern Norway and all the other regions\u201d, but from \u201cAfghanistan, Pakistan and Poland, from Sweden, Somalia and Syria\u201d.<br></p> <p>If they were surprised by the unexpected royal intervention, many of his citizens seemed genuinely pleased. \u201cI\u2019m immeasurably proud to be Norwegian, and to have such a great king and royal family,\u201d said one commenter, Yngve Gasoy Romdal. \u201cYes, we love this country!\u201d</p> <p>Another expressing approval on the state broadcaster NRK\u2019s Facebook page, Lars Jacob Sch\u00e4rer, said it was \u201creally hard to be republican with this royal family \u2013 they are unique, and down-to-earth like most Norwegians. What an example of Norwegian values in practice!\u201d</p> <p>Even more enthusiastic was Rizwan al-Huq: \u201cThis is why we have you, dear king. When monarchy can live hand in hand with democracy, why not support a diverse society and a nation that chooses his own identity with such fine words?\u201d</p> <p>Harald, a champion sailor who in his younger days represented his country three times in the Olympic Games, praised Norway\u2019s beauty, from the \u201chigh mountains and deep fjords\u201d to \u201clush farmland and rolling moors\u201d, but urged its unity.</p> <p>\u201cMy greatest hope for Norway,\u201d he said, \u201cis that we will be able to take care of one another. That we will continue to build this country. That we will feel that we are \u2013 despite our differences \u2013 one people.\u201d </p>",

It is measure of how poorly run the former Big Cup champions Nottingham Forest seem to be that the sale of teenage Scottish sensation Oliver Burke to RB Leipzig for a paltry \u00a313m with no sell-on clause is no longer the most insane bit of business they\u2019ve conducted in the past 10 days.</p> <p>On Wednesday the club announced they\u2019d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/07/nottingham-forest-sign-nicklas-bendtner-on-two-year-contract\">snapped up Nick on a free transfer</a>, a fee which would ordinarily represent good value for money but could prove ridiculously expensive in this case, if history is anything to go by. Bendtner has previous experience of playing in the Championship, when as a callow youth of 18 with a long and distinguished career of underachievement ahead of him, he was shipped out on loan from Arsenal to Birmingham City where he scored 11 goals in 42 matches. That was a decade ago and he has since failed to score more than 10 goals a season for either Sunderland or Juventus or Wolfsburg. </p> <p>Despite this, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fawaz_alhasawi1/status/773467493889368068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">a tweet</a> from Forest chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi imploring fans to welcome Nick to the City Ground was greeted with cautious optimism, with one fan capturing the tone when he said \u201cthis will either be a masterstroke or a disaster, let\u2019s hope you\u2019ve got this one right Mr Chairman\u201d. Perhaps the best response to Al Hasawi\u2019s tweet announcing Nick had joined Nottingham Forest on a two-year deal came from someone named PJ, who was quick to correct the chairman. \u201cI think you mean Nottingham Forest have joined Nicklas Bendtner,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KPBofficial/status/773442188873179136\">\u201cI don\u2019t need to be doing what I am doing when I am doing what I am doing.\u201d</a> suggests Las Palmas\u2019 Kevin-Prince Boateng.

The PM was relatively weak on detail, but she did try to turn the argument into a wider one about values, and about home ownership, and on these points Corbyn\u2019s responses were thin.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/07/theresa-may-pokes-fun-at-jeremy-corbyn-during-pmqs-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/522mv\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2698623\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May pokes fun at Jeremy Corbyn during PMQs \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Parliament TV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d00586e4b042bbfb32432d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/07/160807PMQsjokes_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/07/160807PMQsjokes.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/07/160807PMQsjokes_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/07/theresa-may-pokes-fun-at-jeremy-corbyn-during-pmqs-video\">Theresa May pokes fun at Jeremy Corbyn during PMQs</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T13:27:21.874Z\">at 2.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57cff659e4b042bbfb3242da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T11:18:18.445Z\">12.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says only a year ago May voted against a Labour amendment to the housing bill saying all homes in the rented sector should be fit for habitation. The Treasury is losing \u00a3500m a year from unpaid tax from landlords in the housing sector. Unpaid tax, poor quality homes - doesn\u2019t this require government intervention.</p> <p>May says the government has intervened. Thousands of landlords face further action. Corbyn may have a model of society where he does not want to see private landlords. But that is not what she wants. She wants people to have opportunities.</p> <p>Corbyn says he recognises the case for a mixed housing economy, but he does not want to see people pay excessive rent. Women\u2019s Aid has raised concern about the cuts to housing benefit. Does May accept that very vulnerable women could be affected by the closure of these refuges. Will May ensure the cap on housing benefit does not apply to refuges.</p> <p>May says the government is working on exempting women\u2019s refuges from the housing benefit cap. But the government has a very good record on domestic violence, she says. </p> <p>It is 50 days since she and Corbyn last met at the despatch box. It is good to see him sitting there. The Conservative government has been working tirelessly, she says. She mentions the public sector audit, and work on new trade deals. What a contrast with the party opposite, divided amongst themselves, and incapable of uniting the country.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGP078eWFWI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gGP078eWFWI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T11:53:26.202Z\">at 12.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57cff590e4b0b2ee83375e5c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T11:13:24.542Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says there is a housing crisis in Britain. Some \u00a39.3bn is paid from housing benefit into the pockets of private landlords. Is that money well spent?</p> <p>May says Corbyn asked about home ownership, but than objects to a measure that helps people have homes. Corbyn may have an ideological objection to the private rented sector. Everything Corbyn tells us everything we need to know about Labour. The train has left the station, the leader is on the floor, even on rolling stock, they are a laughing stock.</p> <p>Corbyn says David Cameron said every penny spent on housing subsidies was money that could not be spent on new housing. He quotes someone saying landlords should be fined for renting homes in poor condition. Does the PM think this is satisfactory?</p> <p>May says, if housing benefit is such a bad thing, why did Labour oppose cuts to housing benefit. The rules for landlords have been changed, she says. New rules are being introduced for houses in multiple occupation. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57cff498e4b0b2ee83375e57\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T11:09:56.736Z\">12.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> starts off also congratulating Team GB.

But the government wants to do more, she says.</p> <p>Corbyn says house building is 45,000 a year less than under the last Labour government. He quotes from a note from Jenny. She and her partner work in a supermarket. They have been told they can borrow \u00a373,000. So there is not much hope for them. George Osborne said there would be one to one replacement for homes sold under right to buy. But only one home gets build for every five homes sold. When will one to one replacement come in?</p> <p>May says Corbyn is wrong. The government has delivered on one to one replacement. Corbyn has asked his followers on Twitter for questions. May says she looked at them. He got on from Lewis saying don\u2019t know scored higher than Corbyn on who would make the best prime minister.

But they are contained in a letter that is both critical and patronising. Here\u2019s a flavour of it.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m sorry to say that in her first PMQs in July, you put Theresa May under no pressure at all. You moved from issue to issue with no follow-up for any of your six questions, so that the prime minister\u2019s answers were not challenged.</p> <p>You didn\u2019t even ask her about the EU, even though Brexit was and is the biggest challenge facing her government, and the reason for David Cameron\u2019s resignation and her elevation to Downing Street. Perhaps the same reticence about standing up for Britain\u2019s place in the EU which led you to campaign so ineffectively for Remain also puts you off exposing the weaknesses and contradictions in the Government\u2019s position \u2013 but continuing to fail to take Theresa May on over Brexit would be a dereliction of duty.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here are the specific questions that Smith proposes.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following her experience at the G20 summit this weekend, does the PM regret not campaigning harder for Britain to remain in the EU?</p> <p>The PM has said on a number of occasions that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d. Did she find that this vacuous slogan was sufficient to alleviate our allies\u2019 concerns at the G20 this weekend, or did they still have some questions?</p> <p>The Japanese government raised a number of concerns about what Brexit might mean \u2013 they clearly do not find \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d a sufficient clarification of UK government policy. They want the UK to stay within the single market. But the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union says this is \u201cimprobable\u201d. Does the PM agree with the Japanese Government or her own Secretary of State?</p> <p>President Obama said at the G20 that the USA\u2019s priority would be to pursue trade deals with the EU and with Pacific countries \u2013 not to do a deal with the UK. Does the PM plan to persuade the United States to change its diplomatic priorities, and if so how?</p> <p>Over the last few months a points-based immigration system has been proposed by the Foreign Secretary, the International Trade Secretary, the International Development Secretary, the Environment Secretary and the Transport Secretary. Can the PM confirm that she disagrees with all of them?</p> <p>A points-based immigration system was one of the Leave campaign\u2019s key promises. Can the PM confirm that she also has no intention of honouring the Leave campaign\u2019s promise of an additional \u00a3350m a week for the NHS?</p> </blockquote> <p>The Smith letter was originally written for <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/redbox/topic/corbyns-labour/dear-jeremy-some-questions-you-could-ask-at-pmqs\">the Times\u2019s Red Box website.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57cfd41be4b042bbfb324215\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T09:06:16.794Z\">10.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some more lines from the Today programme\u2019s interview with <strong>Steven Ciobo</strong>, the Australian trade minister.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Ciobo confirmed that Australia had offered to lend trade negotiators to the UK - although his tone suggested it was not a particularly serious offer.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I indicated that if a request was forthcoming, Australia would certainly be willing to help.

  "<h2><em>Arizona Cardinals </em></h2> <p>It\u2019s time for the Cardinals to finally win a Super Bowl. After being blown out in last season\u2019s NFC championship game by the Carolina Panthers, the Cardinals have upgraded their weakest position -pass rush- with the addition of Chandler Jones by way of a trade with the New England Patriots. The return to fitness of Tyrann Mathieu, one of the leagues very best defensive players, will ensure the Cardinals defense will match their offense in terms of skill and playmaking ability. Not forgetting the Cardinals have one of the best coaches in the league in Bruce Arians. <strong><em>Tom Marshall </em></strong></p> <p>The most important thing will be to keep quarterback Carson Palmer healthy. He had such a strong regular season last year, but then faltered in the post-season and ultimately cost the team a chance at the Super Bowl with his horrendous performance against the Panthers. </p> <p>The addition of Chandler Jones gives their defence a legit pass-rush threat that they have sorely lacked for a number of years. Keep him healthy and there\u2019s no reason why he can\u2019t notch double-digit sacks this season. Hopefully rookie defensive lineman Robert Nkemdiche also gets in on the act and proves that the Cardinals got a steal with him late in the first round. If these things happen, we may finally get a Lombardi Trophy in Arizona. <strong><em>Tom Donlan </em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5e68aa7e3fc6e6de90088c36958757ce878944e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5e68aa7e3fc6e6de90088c36958757ce878944e/0_0_4320_3124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arizona Cardinals free safety Tyrann Mathieu warms up prior to an NFL pre-season game against the Denver Broncos, Thursday, Sept. 1, 2016, in Glendale, Ariz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"723\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arizona Cardinals free safety Tyrann Mathieu warms up prior to an NFL pre-season game against the Denver Broncos, Thursday, Sept. 1, 2016, in Glendale, Ariz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Scuteri/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em>Atlanta Falcons </em></h2> <p>I watched the Super Bowl for the first time in 1999 with my dad. Despite their 34-19 defeat to Denver Broncos, I wanted to support the underdogs, especially after their amazing season. So I grew to like Atlanta Falcons. That makes it 16 seasons and counting. </p> <p>Last year hurt. We looked incredible after a 5-0 start under head coach Dan Quinn, but we fell to pieces which wasn\u2019t pretty. If quarterback Matt Ryan, Julio Jones, Devonta Freeman and a slightly improved offensive line show their promise this year, I\u2019m expecting a push for the playoffs - probably a wildcard place in NFC South. Hopefully Quinn has fixed up the defence. We need better defensive performances and more creativity if we are to improve this season. <strong><em>Geoff Hunt</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec3bc9496e81906a8284e003fcb084ef0fb1870d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec3bc9496e81906a8284e003fcb084ef0fb1870d/0_0_4473_2982/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A lot rests on quarterback Matt Ryan this season if Atlanta Falcons are to have a successful year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lot rests on quarterback Matt Ryan this season if Atlanta Falcons are to have a successful year</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dale Zanine/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Baltimore Ravens </em></strong></h2> <p>I have been a fan of the Ravens since 2010. My favourite player of all time has to be Ray Lewis. He was such an emotional leader of his teams as well as such a physical talent. The best season of all time was 2012, when the Ravens beat San Francisco 49ers 34-31 in the Super Bowl. It was Ray Lewis\u2019s final ever NFL game and the perfect way to bow out. We had a disastrously poor season last year, with the Ravens failing to perform all year and not reaching the playoffs. Hopefully this season will be an improvement. </p> <p>This year it would be nice to have a healthy roster and see wide receiver Breshad Perriman have a good season. If we can make it to the playoffs that would be a good season in my books. If our quarterback Joe Flacco can stay fit after his knee problems, then we can do well. We also need to improve our defensive play. That is a cornerstone of good Ravens football and we need to get back to that. <strong><em>Daryl Anderson</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bad618dcd6003ce42a86972e921eba64ef67396\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bad618dcd6003ce42a86972e921eba64ef67396/0_0_3863_2575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Can Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco stay fit for the campaign?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Can Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco stay fit for the campaign?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tommy Gilligan/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Buffalo Bills </em></strong></h2> <p>My hopes are that the Bills finally play up to the talent on the roster. We\u2019ve never had a team this good on paper across all phases, and the real question mark hangs over head coach Rex Ryan. I\u2019ve learned not to expect a 10-6 or playoff season, though it isn\u2019t out of reach. I expect the offence to be explosive and frustrating in equal measure, with a heavy dose of the run game punctuated with big passing plays that play to quarterback Tyrod Taylor\u2019s strengths. It won\u2019t always be pretty but it should be effective. </p> <p>On D I expect a huge improvement on last year (it can\u2019t get much worse!), maybe not the top five Rex promised the world, but a top 10-15 would stop us losing games that we should win. The questions are whether Ryan can get the team playing disciplined football, whether Tyrod Taylor and Sammy Watkins can stay healthy and build on last season, and whether young players like Ronald Derby can continue stepping up. I expect to be entertained and there is definitely cause to be optimistic as there always is in pre-season! <strong><em>Craig Warner</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9a9750d627b673305afdceedcc1d566590779b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9a9750d627b673305afdceedcc1d566590779b3/0_0_4036_3078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Buffalo Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor is chased by New York Giants defensive end Olivier Vernon from the pocket during a pre-season game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"763\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Buffalo Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor is chased by New York Giants defensive end Olivier Vernon from the pocket during a pre-season game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Hoffman/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/31/nfc-south-season-preview-carolina-panthers\">NFC South season preview: were the Panthers a one-year wonder?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong><em>Chicago Bears</em></strong></h2> <p>With an upgraded defence, two genuine quality receivers, a kind looking schedule and coach John Fox in his second season, there\u2019s nothing to say we can\u2019t get to the playoffs. <strong><em>Milan Joshi </em></strong></p> <p>With our decent draft and free agency manoeuvres, I\u2019m hoping for a push towards a playoff place. I trust head coach Fox and think he\u2019s the right man for the job, but fear the job is bigger than he first thought. Jay Cutler will need to rediscover his pre-humungous contract form and to do that Alshon Jeffery will have to maintain his fitness for a full season. Both are big asks and long shots. Jeffery should be motivated in a contract year and Kevin White playing alongside him will hopefully help spread some of the coverage. I pray to see smiles on what has been sullen faces at the end of this regular season. <strong><em>Ed Arnoll</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b33328297620141ae125fca8e96ce125358ff555\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b33328297620141ae125fca8e96ce125358ff555/0_0_2672_2004/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler passes the ball during the first quarter of a pre-season game against the Denver Broncos at Soldier Field.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler passes the ball during the first quarter of a pre-season game against the Denver Broncos at Soldier Field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dennis Wierzbicki/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Cincinatti Bengals </em></strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve been supporting the Bengals for nine years, and chose them because I love an underdog. But I\u2019ve yet to see the Bengals win a playoff game, and last season was especially hard to take, so it would be nice if I can tick that off my list this year. </p> <p>We\u2019ve struggled with injuries in the post-season in the past, so keeping key players like quarterback Andy Dalton, wide receiver A. J. Green and defensive tackle Geno Atkins fit will give us the best possible chance of improving head coach Marvin Lewis\u2019s awful record. <strong><em>Neale Halkett</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"158a00a3c08ded7e25e25ab50ceed4da26cb20da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/158a00a3c08ded7e25e25ab50ceed4da26cb20da/0_0_3728_2484/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton walks off the field after the team\u2019s NFL pre-season game against the Minnesota Vikings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton walks off the field after the team\u2019s NFL pre-season game against the Minnesota Vikings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Victores/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Cleveland Browns</em></strong></h2> <p>I started following the Browns in the early 1980s. I was totally transfixed with the brown and orange colours of the team\u2019s jerseys. Some say it\u2019s not the nicest combination but I think it\u2019s magical. Bernie Kosar is my favourite ever player. Back in the 80s the Browns would challenge the Broncos and Steelers at the very top. The last couple of seasons have been a total living nightmare- we are usually out of the running by October. </p> <p>I\u2019m optimistic about the new coach Hue Jackson and pray he can make us a little bit more competitive. It would be nice if we were still in the running for something by the time Thanksgiving comes around this year. That would be small progress but progress all the same. <strong><em>Paul Tate</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0590451d347dd0893349e631137fb5e0e34976ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0590451d347dd0893349e631137fb5e0e34976ba/0_0_3669_2534/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will wide receiver Josh Gordon and quarterback Robert Griffin III inspire Cleveland Browns to be competitive this season?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will wide receiver Josh Gordon and quarterback Robert Griffin III inspire Cleveland Browns to be competitive this season?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Behnken/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Dallas Cowboys</em></strong></h2> <p>Winning the NFC East is the main hope. After last year a return to a competitive season is a must and a promising rookie season for Ezekiel Elliott would help the Cowboys achieve that. The health of quarterback Tony Romo is key to everything at the AT&amp;T Stadium, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/27/cowboys-tony-romo-facing-six-to-10-weeks-out-with-broken-bone-in-back\">news of his injury before the season has even started</a> is a major blow. The defence also needs to gel to offset a lack of top tier talent and a number of injuries and suspensions. <strong><em>Luk</em></strong><strong><em>e Harrison</em></strong></p> <p>We had a great season in 2014, when DeMarco Murray was outstanding. I was so disappointed last season because it started off so well and lack of good backup quarterback hurt us big time. There weren\u2019t many positives around the club, so this season will hopefully be better. If we keep everyone fit, the offence can be the star this season. It\u2019s one of the best in the division, and it always has been. But our defence won\u2019t win the Super Bowl unfortunately. I\u2019d love someone to come through the ranks to give Tony Romo a reliable backup. Could Dak Prescott possibly be that guy? <strong><em>Oli </em></strong><strong><em>Davies</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc5cdedfd85d52ff0c38b094c5e63d1f74cc424c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc5cdedfd85d52ff0c38b094c5e63d1f74cc424c/0_0_2965_1977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott throws a pass in the second quarter of a pre-season friendly against the Miami Dolphins at AT&amp;T Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott throws a pass in the second quarter of a pre-season friendly against the Miami Dolphins at AT&amp;T Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Heitman/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Detroit Lions</em></strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s no realistic route to the playoffs this year. I can\u2019t see us getting past strong Packers and Vikings teams, but I\u2019d be happy if I feel things are going in the right direction. Offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter must get the best out of quarterback Matt Stafford. I\u2019d also like to see the receiver core not losing too much ground from last year, which is possible if Marvin Jones steps up. It would be nice to actually have a running game of some kind... Going 8-8 without \u201cMegatron\u201d Calvin Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/08/detroit-lions-receiver-calvin-johnson-retires-nfl\">who announced his retirement earlier this year</a>, would feel like an achievement. <strong><em>Joe </em></strong><strong><em>Sturge</em></strong></p> <p>The Lions\u2019 division will be difficult this year with Green Bay likely to get back to their best, Minnesota a team on the rise and the Bears having made some good free agency moves. I\u2019d hope the Lions can get close to 9-7 and a Wildcard slot. After a disastrous start last year they finished well. It could come down to their ability to close out close games. That\u2019s something they didn\u2019t do enough of last year. The Lions have to find a way to replace the catches, yards and touchdowns of retired Calvin Johnson. He was a great safety blanket for Matt Stafford. We could do with a good second season from Ameer Abdullah. On the other side of the ball the defence needs to help out Ziggy Ansah. He can\u2019t do it all on his own. Hopefully a fully fit DeAndre Levy will help after he missed most of last year. <strong><em>Phil Ashford</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1f18b6748d48b0a40d16d69c431dfb9e6cd93a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1f18b6748d48b0a40d16d69c431dfb9e6cd93a0/0_0_4320_3048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Detroit Lions wide receiver Jeremy Kerley runs after a catch past Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback Dorian Grant during a pre-season friendly at Heinz Field.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detroit Lions wide receiver Jeremy Kerley runs after a catch past Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback Dorian Grant during a pre-season friendly at Heinz Field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles LeClaire/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Denver Broncos </em></strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/05/afc-west-season-preview-denver-broncos-oakland-raiders-chiefs-chargers\">AFC West season preview: the Broncos could well go from first to worst</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I certainly expect the Broncos to make the playoffs this year. Although it will be tough playing in a division as competitive as the AFC West, where you could honestly make a case that every team could make the playoffs. I think the defence will once again top the league in total defence and I expect that the offence will be powered by the running game. </p> <p>The absolute essential key will be quarterback play. The Broncos don\u2019t need an Aaron Rodgers. All they need is an average quarterback that can move the chains, hand the ball off and most importantly turn the ball over a lot less. That was the big question mark over Mark Sanchez, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/03/mark-sanchez-dallas-cowboys-one-year-contract\">the reason we let him go to Dallas Cowboys</a>. He can make some plays, but he is prone to turning the ball over. If we can get a 10-6 season and make the playoffs, well you never know right? Who picked the Broncos to win the super bowl last year? It\u2019s football anything can happen. <strong><em>Frank Walker</em></strong></p> <p>I almost don\u2019t want this year to start as we still bask in the glow of a Super Bowl victory. This year will be not much different to last year despite Peyton Manning\u2019s departure. I would expect to make the Playoffs despite the AFC West being a much rougher road to travel now then it was 12 months ago. I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath about getting back to the Super Bowl with the Patriots and Steelers looking too strong at this point in the AFC. <strong><em>Matt Beesley</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f496b74337049347ff66c79c0550c6f9db9f7c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f496b74337049347ff66c79c0550c6f9db9f7c1/0_0_3500_2268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning waves to the crowd after helping to clinch the 50th Super Bowl against Carolina Panthers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning waves to the crowd after helping to clinch the 50th Super Bowl against Carolina Panthers</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Usa Today Sports/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Green Bay Packers </em></strong></h2> <p>I expect the Pack at the very least to make the NFC Championship game, but the hope is to reach another Super Bowl while Aaron Rodgers is in his prime. He\u2019s the best quarterback in the NFL. Last season he struggled with an ever-changing receiving corp, but I believe this will be a strength rather than a weakness going into the new season. </p> <p>Jordy Nelson is back from his ACL injury and thus Randall Cobb can go back to his natural position to recreate what was the most potent WR duo of the 2014 NFL season. Jared Abbrederis and Jeff Janis have shown they can add an extra dimension to the WRs, and Jared Cook will bring some much needed athleticism to the tight-end position. Rodgers should have plenty of targets and, if the O-line, and the slimmed-down Eddie Lacy do their job, the Packers offence could be incredibly difficult to stop. <strong><em>Patrick Clinton-Dix</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"483b3db10315da9d6381d5f12580f37abd6effd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/483b3db10315da9d6381d5f12580f37abd6effd8/0_0_4674_3236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers looks on prior to the 2016 Hall of Fame Game at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers looks on prior to the 2016 Hall of Fame Game at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Doster/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Houston Texans </em></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4eb7edb444caffdab2dfc3272543673bb25966f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4eb7edb444caffdab2dfc3272543673bb25966f5/0_0_768_1024/750.jpg\" alt=\"Graham Henderson - \u2018The Kilted Texan\u2019\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graham Henderson - \u2018The Kilted Texan\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Henderson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like any fan I hope that my team will win the Super Bowl. And what better incentive for the Texans this year than the fact it will be held in their home stadium. That should be motivation enough to make that dream come true. The sobering truth though is that, although we have improved this off-season, I still think the Super Bowl will be just be out of reach. I do believe we will win the AFC South and I\u2018m also hopeful of a deep playoff run. </p> <p>The key to success for the Texans this year is that our newly bolstered offense can match up to the high standards set by our defence. We went big this off season acquiring what we believe is a highly talented quarterback and a very good running back. A lot of money was spent bringing Brock Osweiler away from the Super Bowl winning Broncos and for good reason. The quarterback position has been a problem for us the last couple of seasons so bringing in a real talent at that position was a must. Lamarr Miller was brought in to replace the ailing Arian Foster and I think that was a clever move. Miami did not use him nearly enough and I think with the workload the Texans are offering he will shine brightly and give the Texans that ground game they had two seasons ago that dominated so much. </p> <p>JJ Watt is looking to play in the season opener so let\u2019s just hope he hasn\u2019t come back too soon. We also need Jadeveon Clowney to be the player we expected him to be when we drafted him first in 2014. If Watt and Clowney are firing on all cylinders, they\u2019ll be fearsome duo and could potentially lead us to that deep playoff run or Super Bowl ring all Texan fans are looking for. <strong><em>Graham Henderson</em></strong> The Kilted Texan<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ead8cfec3795b80618a5f1eb46438078a65377b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ead8cfec3795b80618a5f1eb46438078a65377b/0_0_4284_2847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joel Heath and Ufomba Kamalu of the Houston Texans celebrate after recovering a fumble against the Arizona Cardinals in the third quarter of a preseason NFL game at NRG Stadium on August 28, 2016 in Houston, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joel Heath and Ufomba Kamalu of the Houston Texans celebrate after recovering a fumble against the Arizona Cardinals in the third quarter of a preseason NFL game at NRG Stadium on August 28, 2016 in Houston, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Robbins/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Indianapolis Colts</em></strong><br></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/afc-south-preview-andrew-luck-indianapolis-colts-nfl\">AFC South questions for 2016: can Andrew Luck drag the Colts to the postseason?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year was a real let down. Having signed Frank Gore and Andre Johnson (already released ahead of this season), as well as quarterback Andrew Luck being on a steady upward curve, I thought we could have gone deep into the playoffs. However, the O-Line was terrible, Luck was injured most of the season and we couldn\u2019t even muster a winning record.</p> <p>Topping the division and making the playoffs this season is still the hope, but with teams in the AFC South all adding depth in free agency it will be tough. A lot of our success will rest on the offensive line\u2019s ability to hold up, allowing quarterback Andrew Luck time in the pocket. The hope is also that Luck stays fit and cuts out interceptions, which he struggled with last year. <strong><em>Declan Maher</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f52c58cf1236600b50eb12b520d2be1ef2f0d2bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f52c58cf1236600b50eb12b520d2be1ef2f0d2bd/0_0_3600_2384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck on the sidelines during pre-season against the Philadelphia Eagles at Lucas Oil Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck on the sidelines during pre-season against the Philadelphia Eagles at Lucas Oil Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas  J.

Tight end Julius Thomas is finally getting intigrated, and with the addition of running back Chris Ivory to smash in the touchdowns, we look scarily good. The additions at Defense need to have an immediate impact and the whole outfit needs to be tighter so the Offense can have more time to do their thing. <strong><em>Mark</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11679cf78de0c1cbd01193a073b1dea7c103ceea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11679cf78de0c1cbd01193a073b1dea7c103ceea/0_0_3507_2541/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacksonville Jaguars tight end Julius Thomas attempts to catch a pass against the Buffalo Bills during last season\u2019s NFL International Series game at Wembley Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"725\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacksonville Jaguars tight end Julius Thomas attempts to catch a pass against the Buffalo Bills during last season\u2019s NFL International Series game at Wembley Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Kansas City Chiefs</em></strong></h2> <p>My hope ahead of the season is to win the AFC West for the first time since 2010, get a first round bye and progress to the AFC championship game. The O-line needs to improve in pass protection to allow our quarterback Alex Smith time to throw. Another wide receiver needs to emerge behind WR#2 has to emerge behind Jeremy Maclin and Travis Kelce in the passing game to force opposing defenses to respect the passing game. This would allow running backs Jamaal Charles, Spencer Ware and Charcandrick West to take advantage of a less stacked box in the run game. <strong><em>Alex </em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3e3738acfc7c9b3c0e835ac83942290aa93e81d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3e3738acfc7c9b3c0e835ac83942290aa93e81d/0_0_3000_1889/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith calls a play during the first half of last season\u2019s NFL Wildcard playoff football game against the Houston Texans.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"630\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith calls a play during the first half of last season\u2019s NFL Wildcard playoff football game against the Houston Texans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Bridges/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Los Angeles Rams</em></strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/06/nfc-west-preview-seattle-seahawks-los-angeles-rams-jared-goff\">NFC West preview: is No1 pick Jared Goff already a bust for the Rams?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019ve been a fan of the Rams since 1986 and am pleased they have moved back to LA. I think we can finally have a winning season and maybe sneak a wildcard spot. I hope that Jared Goff lives up to his lofty draft pick or it could set the franchise back again. The key to success this season is to play great defence led by Aaron Donald, the O Line needs to block for Todd Gurley and Case Keenum has to manage the game. If Goff progresses and is ready to take the field at some point this season, then hopefully it takes us to a playoff spot. <strong><em>Nick Henderson </em></strong></p> <p>I hope the Rams make the playoffs, and that young quarterback Jared Goff continues his development. If we continue to win without him, I would be happy for Goff to sit for the season and learn. We need to improve offensively. The efficiency of quarterback by Case Keenum will be the most important thing for the Rams to make the playoffs. We were only just out of the playoffs with perhaps the worst offence in the league last season, so anything better than that should have us in contention. <strong><em>Zaimondos</em></strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a18563132ecb1bc7432aa5b02bb93adf37647fcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a18563132ecb1bc7432aa5b02bb93adf37647fcb/0_0_2164_1528/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will Los Angeles Rams quarterback Case Keenum have an efficient enough season for his side to reach the playoffs this year?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Los Angeles Rams quarterback Case Keenum have an efficient enough season for his side to reach the playoffs this year?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirby Lee/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Miami Dolphins</em></strong></h2> <p>After some very meagre seasons in AFL East, expectations are low and optimism is even lower.

The Vikings are becoming a real force in the NFL. With a young and upcoming squad, a quarterback starting to show his potential and a brand-new stadium which holds over 66,000, this season could be very excited for the team and its fans. We look solid in defence and unpredictable pushing forward, the roster is strong and is more than capable of upsetting the odds this season. </p> <p>Unfortunately the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/teddy-bridgewater-injury-minnesota-vikings-nfl\">serious pre-season injury</a> suffered by our young and promising quarterback Teddy Bridgewater has rocked the team. He struggled in his first term with the Vikings last season but had impressed so far and he will be a huge loss. The pressure on running back Adrian Peterson just got a whole lot bigger. <strong><em>Nathan Evans</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fdc944c38ac86163a73b79aabbac6b4939b07b23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdc944c38ac86163a73b79aabbac6b4939b07b23/0_0_4674_3042/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson will need to have a good season if the Vikings are to fulfill their potential.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson will need to have a good season if the Vikings are to fulfill their potential.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Butch Dill/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>New England Patriots </em></strong></h2> <p>I hope we see New England in their sixth consecutive AFC Championship game this season. Not just because I always hope for a trip to the Super Bowl, but because I want us to prove that we are more than just Tom Brady. Sure, he has been our rock for many years, but we owe so much to the positional coaches and the B and C level players who come in and train and perform the Patriots way. </p> <p>Head coach Bill Belichick\u2019s team have always been better than the sum of their parts, so I hope we match or even exceed our usual quality, and take the focus from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/05/tom-brady-accept-deflategate-ban-personal-decision\">deflategate</a> and back to the team and the coaches who make the franchise a joy to support. Guys like Jamie Collins, Rob Binkovich and Devin McCourty need to continue to play at the level they have precious seasons, and our line need to protect first Jimmy Garoppolo and later Brady. <strong><em>Christopher Wilson</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8250666af5d32b27c522bd2dbbaf78c8128fe85e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8250666af5d32b27c522bd2dbbaf78c8128fe85e/0_0_3425_2283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New England Patriots quarterbacks Tom Brady and Jimmy Garoppolo talk prior to the pre-season game against the Carolina Panthers at Bank of America Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New England Patriots quarterbacks Tom Brady and Jimmy Garoppolo talk prior to the pre-season game against the Carolina Panthers at Bank of America Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeremy Brevard/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>New Orleans Saints </em></strong></h2> <p>The team last year was so unbalanced. An awesome attack was time and again let down by a woeful defence. It provided some great entertainment at times - beating the Giants 52-49 and a few very close run games against Panthers. But it felt like all the hard work done by quarterback Drew Brees was for nothing. </p> <p>A new defensive coordinator in Dennis Allen improved the final few games but the bar was set epically low. Even a middling defence coupled with a strong offence should result in perhaps a Wildcard entrance to the playoffs. Carolina Panthers still look the team to beat in the South, but we should rightfully expect to be better than Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. We need a few pieces to stay fit to give Brees\u2019s shoulders a rest, but a 9-7 is within grasp. <strong><em>Liam</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d104f73d53acc845379088a93beef384c2665d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d104f73d53acc845379088a93beef384c2665d9/0_0_2314_1621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees makes a throw in the second quarter of the pre-season game against the Pittsburgh Steelers at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"701\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees makes a throw in the second quarter of the pre-season game against the Pittsburgh Steelers at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chuck Cook/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>New York Giants </em></strong></h2> <p>A lot of fans are saying a playoff run or bust given our expensive offseason, but I\u2019ll settle for steady progress. I\u2019d also like to see us close out games where we\u2019re leading. We blew an awful lot of leads last year. If we can finish above .500 (8-8) and everyone stays healthy (yes Victor Cruz that means you), I\u2019ll be happy. The roster on paper is very talented, if they play they\u2019ll perform. If our wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. plays 16 games, he\u2019ll top 1,500 receiving yards without a doubt. <strong><em>Ben </em></strong></p> <p>Our weakness since winning the Super Bowl in 2012 has been defence. If some games last season had been 30 seconds shorter, we\u2019d have finished 11-5. In all those instances it was a weak defence that was to blame. We can definitely convert to being a very dangerous team so long as we hold up in the clutch defence moments. In Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. we have a fierce offence pair. If our Secondary holds itself together with the new additions, and if wide receiver Victor Cruz picks up near the ability he had when he last played, there is nothing stopping us making the playoffs or even the Super Bowl itself.<strong><em> Elliot </em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"641ed5ac7692cdbd0c29da06c465b0e13f423d17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/641ed5ac7692cdbd0c29da06c465b0e13f423d17/0_0_5015_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning talks with wide receiver Odell Beckham during a pre-season game against Buffalo Bills at New Era Field.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning talks with wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. during a pre-season game against Buffalo Bills at New Era Field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Hoffman/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a7ccaefdb944e14262aaaa4a41ac7136a1e684c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7ccaefdb944e14262aaaa4a41ac7136a1e684c2/0_0_536_536/500.jpg\" alt=\"Greg Smith\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greg Smith</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>New York Jets</em></strong></h2> <p>After finishing 10-6 last season, and just missing the playoffs, I\u2019m hoping that we pick up where we left off. All the pieces are in place to contend for a wildcard playoff spot come January. It all comes down to quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick. He broke franchise records last year by throwing for 31 touchdowns. If he can repeat that performance or come close, our defence is strong enough to carry the rest of the team to victory. </p> <p>The Jets are yet to win a Super Bowl in my life time. Having said that I\u2019ve enjoyed every season supporting them, because the teams are all so competitive in the AFC East. Last season was probably the most disappointing as we had all the players to make it to the playoffs. Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick had a poor game against Buffalo Bills on the last day of the regular season, and it spiralled out of control from there. <strong><em>Greg Smith </em></strong><br></p> <p>I expect the Jets to make it to the playoffs again at the very least. Their defense is one of the best in the game and feared by all quarterbacks. I\u2019m made up that the Jets found a way to bring back Fitzpatrick this year. He\u2019ll be a very important part of the Jets\u2019 game plan. <strong><em>Haydn </em></strong><strong><em>Gossage</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c7ce68db9f1faec3e84af9fb8faaca1251819d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c7ce68db9f1faec3e84af9fb8faaca1251819d6/0_0_2000_1331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New York Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick looks to pass against the Philadelphia Eagles at MetLife Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New York Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick looks to pass against the Philadelphia Eagles at MetLife Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Ryan/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em>Oakland Raiders</em></h2> <p>With a promising core of young players on both sides of the ball, and their additions in the offseason, it isn\u2019t unrealistic to think the Raiders could get three more wins and improve to 10-6. The AFC West is going to be so tight this year. I don\u2019t buy the hype that the Broncos are going to implode. Their D will be incredible again. Whoever plays at QB will simply be required to not turn the ball over. The Chiefs are going to be well drilled again and are settled at most key positions. The Chargers simply cannot have the same injury bad luck they had a year ago. I also see their D being much improved with their young linebackers and pass rushers.<br></p> <p>All put together I think Oakland are most likely to improve this year. If they end up 9-7 or 10-6 and miss out on the playoffs I wouldn\u2019t be too disappointed. They will have improved again and the coaching staff will have shown that they are on the right track. The offseason additions need to live up to their names and pay cheques though. There is always the possibility that introducing a lot of new faces can backfire but the Raiders seem to have gone after real pros this off season which gives me reason to be optimistic that this could be a top 10 defence.<strong><em> Tom Kingston</em></strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3d4cc62292d5ea38368ec0fa5400f22d8d23218\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3d4cc62292d5ea38368ec0fa5400f22d8d23218/0_0_2611_1855/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oakland Raiders quarterback Derek Carr greets a young fan before game against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"710\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oakland Raiders quarterback Derek Carr greets a young fan before game against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benny Sieu/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Philadelphia Eagles </em></strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/07/nfc-east-preview-eagles-cowboys-washington-giants\">NFC East preview: do the Eagles and Cowboys have any plausible plans?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite the conventional wisdom that teams with new, untested coaches will likely not make an impact in their first year, I am cautiously optimistic that the Eagles will still fight for the top spot in the NFC East under rookie head coach Doug Pederson. We need the defense to be consistent. Strength at the back has been an emerging trademark of the Eagles. We also need to mould another quality quarterback. Our team has struggled mightily with that position for decades and it must be established in this season, whoever stands under center. <strong><em>Edward Marks </em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de765356357183e1f9418d649eb8149a4931a9f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de765356357183e1f9418d649eb8149a4931a9f7/0_0_4211_2975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philadelphia Eagles head coach Doug Pederson talks to Carson Wentz during a timeout in the pre-season game against Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Lincoln Financial Field.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philadelphia Eagles head coach Doug Pederson talks to Carson Wentz during a timeout in the pre-season game against Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Lincoln Financial Field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mitchell Leff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Pittsburgh Steelers </em></strong></h2> <p>For the Steelers the real hope this year is to make it to the 51st Super Bowl. The roster looks really strong and if we stay healthy throughout the season, we won\u2019t be too far away. Steering clear of injuries is the only thing that is a must, but unfortunately this is beyond our control. <strong><em>Tyler</em></strong></p> <p>After the Super Bowl I felt that the Steelers were the favourite to be there in 2017, but no sooner had I looked at the betting odds when Martavis Bryant pushed the limits of fans goodwill by getting his one year ban. Then followed Le\u2019Veon Bell with a three match ban. Add to this the alarming number of players already on the IR list and it just doesn\u2019t feel like the stars are aligning. That said I think we can take the AFC North and then who knows? </p> <p>There has been a lot of criticism about the defence, but by the end of the year we were a top 10 defence in almost every category. If we can build on these improvements and keep the Ben, Brown and Bell fit then at least it will be a entertaining season. I\u2019ll be watching every minute I can. <strong><em>Ted Faulkner</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"473703d7b6d38679c4851f404d2adedcb1ca540e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/473703d7b6d38679c4851f404d2adedcb1ca540e/0_0_4601_3101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pittsburgh Steelers free safety Mike Mitchell celebrates a play in the second quarter against the New Orleans Saints at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pittsburgh Steelers free safety Mike Mitchell celebrates a play in the second quarter against the New Orleans Saints at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chuck Cook/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>San Diego Chargers</em></strong></h2> <p>The Chargers will definitely improve on last year\u2019s terrible season.

They looked so great with Joe Montana and Jerry Rice, and my favourite season as a 49ers fan was when they won the Super Bowl in 1994. Quarterback Steve Young was fantastic that year. My biggest disappointment was probably last season. It\u2019s only been a few years since the 49ers were in the Super Bowl or in the playoffs but to see them be a punchline last season was tough. They didn\u2019t look like they had any plan with all their QB troubles, injuries, and a leaky defence.</p> <p>It\u2019d be nice to think about the playoffs this season, but I think Arizona and Seattle will be too tough to beat. Realistically I\u2019d settle at not being the division\u2019s whipping boys like last year. How head coach Chip Kelly organises the team this year will be a big factor. Can running back Carlos Hyde stay healthy and make an impact? Can wide receiver Torrey Smith make the step up? And the big question is what\u2019s going to happen at QB? There\u2019s a lot of questions about how the 49ers will play under a new coach, but there are reasons to hope the team is heading in the right direction. </p> <p>In terms of the furore surrounding Colin Kaepernick and his refusal to stand for the national anthem, I think it was a brave move. NFL stars are some of the most prominent black figures in the country so when a guy who should really keep his head down and try to get back in the team makes a stand, I think it says something. They need to keep the debate happening as role models and prominent figures. <strong><em>Andy Prentice</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9072a35822d5d3aee695cd10326864534ee6bd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9072a35822d5d3aee695cd10326864534ee6bd2/0_0_4896_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco 49ers fans cheer during pre-season action against Houston Texans at Levi\u2019s Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">San Francisco 49ers fans cheer during pre-season action against Houston Texans at Levi\u2019s Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cary Edmondson/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Seattle Seahawks </em></strong></h2> <p>So far the Hawks look like a Super Bowl team again this year. They have the talent, depth and the attitude, and the offensive line is starting to gel. There are no serious injuries to key players, and both running back Thomas Rawls and tight end Jimmy Graham are living up to the expectations we have for them. The defense just has to play like they have the last four years. That shouldn\u2019t be a problem. <strong><em>Bob C</em></strong></p> <p>With a mix of exciting fresh faces and healed key players, I\u2019m hoping for at least the playoffs again this season. The protection of quarterback Russell Wilson needs to be stepped up this season. If that pocket stays clear, I can see him passing the ball more like the end of last season. Seahawks are upping their game. Be aware! <strong><em>Robert Collins </em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e6b584ef9467b4e2ea99aecedb55a91c2685763\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e6b584ef9467b4e2ea99aecedb55a91c2685763/0_0_3384_2154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seattle Seahawks running back Thomas Rawls rushes against Pittsburgh Steelers at CenturyLink Field.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"637\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seattle Seahawks running back Thomas Rawls rushes against Pittsburgh Steelers at CenturyLink Field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Otto Greule Jr/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</em></strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve been a Tampa Bay fan since a visit to the Raymond James Stadium in 2012, so I have known only the dark times associated with following the Bucs. I would love to say my hopes for the season would be a second Lombardi, but the reality has to be respected and the best this young exciting team can hope for is an NFC Wild Card position. The Carolina Panthers are a sure fire bet to win the NFC South for the fourth successive year. </p> <p>For the first time in their history, the Bucs have a franchise quarterback in Jameis Winston and you should believe the hype. Add in the top tandem of running backs from last year\u2019s NFL in Doug Martin and Charles Sims, along with impressive big wide receivers in experienced Vincent Jackson and the youthful Mike Evans, you can understand why the Bucs ranked 5th overall on Offense last year. As far as Defense is concerned, the Bucs already had some quality pieces in defensive tackle Gerald McCoy and linebackers Lavonte David and Kwon Alexander. They can only get better with the addition of a genuine pass rush, something that has been sorely lacking in Tampa ever Simeon Rice left the building.</p> <p>Of course a new Head Coach in Dirk Koetter,last years offensive co-ordinator, brings a feeling of urgency to the front office and the hire of ex-Atlanta Falcons Head Coach Mike Smith should also bring more dynamic schemes to what is shaping up to be a greatly improved Defense especially against the pass. A Super Bowl in 2016? Maybe not. A Super Bowl before the decade is out? Maybe, Tampa, just maybe. <strong><em>Stuart Anderson </em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7677ed4c29c5414915444331686c3524d5ef540\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7677ed4c29c5414915444331686c3524d5ef540/0_0_3360_2601/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston throws a pass against the Cleveland Browns during the first quarter of an NFL football game Friday, Aug. 26, 2016, in Tampa, Fla.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"774\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston throws a pass against the Cleveland Browns during the first quarter of an NFL football game Friday, Aug. 26, 2016, in Tampa, Fla.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris O'Meara/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Tennessee Titans </em></strong></h2> <p>I\u2019m hoping to avoid a losing record, go 8-8 and finish 3rd in the AFC South, ahead of the Brock Osweiler led Texans. If we succeed we\u2019ll get there on a brutal running game and keeping our franchise quarterback healthy for all 16 games. We need better offense line play than last year. It would be hard to get worse to be honest. A competent receiver to step up and make some plays to reduce the pressure on tight end Delaine Walker and quarterback Marcus Mariota would also be welocme. <strong><em>David</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"289b62a4f75991f23af4d3e29f970310bededdf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/289b62a4f75991f23af4d3e29f970310bededdf9/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tennessee Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota during warm up prior to the game against the Carolina Panthers at Nissan Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tennessee Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota during warm up prior to the game against the Carolina Panthers at Nissan Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Brown/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Washington </em></strong></h2> <p>I expect the NFC East will be a very close division this year. Every team has question marks heading into the season. I think Washington will win the division, but possibly only with a 9-7 record. The key is the running game, which went AWOL last season. It heaped a lot of pressure onto the inexperienced shoulders of quarterback Kirk Cousins who did a superb job under the circumstances. He has some real weapons in the passing game and, if wide receiver Josh Doctson can stay fit, he\u2019ll be seeing a lot of the ball, as opponents tend to focus on DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon. They can all turn short receptions into long gains. </p> <p>The defense is certainly better, especially in the secondary, where the addition of Josh Norman is a significant upgrade. With Bashaud Breeland developing into a very good cornerback option, Quinton Dunbar also shaping up nicely, the Redskins should defend the pass much better. They need to defend the run better and, while the loss of linebacker Junior Gallette may yet hurt us, they have some depth which should help alleviate his loss. <strong><em>quicknstraight</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b3fa7c510316e7ce389293c841f2eb943e6848a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b3fa7c510316e7ce389293c841f2eb943e6848a/0_0_2778_2012/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Washington quarterback Colt McCoy and wide receiver Rashad Ross celebrate connecting for a touchdown during the first half of an NFL pre-season game against New York Jets.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Washington quarterback Colt McCoy and wide receiver Rashad Ross celebrate connecting for a touchdown during the first half of an NFL pre-season game against New York Jets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Wass/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

Produced by black movie mogul Will Packer and written by David Loughery, who also wrote Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, Obsessed sets the template for the genre with a story about a successful black couple (Beyonc\u00e9 and Idris Elba) who are terrorized by insane white lady Ali Larter, who wants nothing more than to have sex with Idris Elba, which is pretty relatable for most viewers, I\u2019d imagine. She\u2019s a temp at the office where Elba\u2019s character works and falls in love with him instantly. That love leads her to drugging and raping him, because it\u2019s that kind of movie and you just have to go with it.

Regardless, you are going to have to pay for your crime, possibly through a gruesome death at the hands of a very attractive person.</p> <h2>Addicted (2014)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LErjzY_wKI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4LErjzY_wKI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Based on the romance novel by Zane (not Billy Zane or Zane Lowe or Zayn Malik \u2013 just Zane), Addicted is another slight variation on the typical tropes of the genre. This time, the sexually obsessed maniac is the protagonist. Sharon Leal plays Zoe, a successful business owner with a husband and two children. She\u2019s got the perfect life ... or does she? You see, she loves sex. In fact, she loves it so much that after two acrobatic romps with her also very successful husband (Boris Kodjoe) in the first scene of the film, she wants to go again, but, as you might expect, he\u2019d prefer to go to sleep. Her insatiable desire leads her to a series of affairs which turn messy when the two secret lovers become aware of each other.</p> <p>While the appeal of this genre is usually based in titillation and sexual wish fulfillment, Addicted subverts that, while also reveling in it. Zoe is a sex addict because she was molested as a child, so as much fun as the viewer might have watching attractive people engaging in softcore sex scenes, Addicted becomes a message movie about a very real problem in the third act. An exploitation film that pivots to actual pain at the end is like eating ice cream and finding the percentage of the global homeless population written on the bottom of the bowl.</p> <h2>The Perfect Guy (2015)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CikoxQ4ytI4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CikoxQ4ytI4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Surprisingly, this is the first appearance of African American cinema\u2019s hardest working actor, the legendary Morris Chestnut. If there\u2019s a movie about black folks, chances are strong that Morris Chestnut will show up: The Best Man, The Inkwell, Boyz in the Hood, Think Like a Man, Not Easily Broken, Like Mike. He\u2019s truly black America\u2019s Josh Duhamel or James Marsden. Sure, he\u2019s not on the level of Idris Elba or Denzel Washington (who would never submit to starring in one of these movies, by the way) but name me one film that isn\u2019t better from going Full Chestnut? That\u2019s right, you can\u2019t. How is it that there are numerous black superheroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and yet none of them are played by Morris Chestnut? Why is Morris Chestnut not in the Fast and Furious series? Can I get #JusticeForMorrisChestnut trending on Twitter?</p> <p>Anyway, in The Perfect Guy, Chestnut is the ineffectual boyfriend of Sanaa Lathan. He doesn\u2019t want to commit, so she dumps him and shacks up with an edgy guy she meets at work, played by Michael Ealy. He ends up being an insane stalker, she tries to dump him and go back to her ex, but the dude\u2019s a stalker and doesn\u2019t take the hint. Ealy\u2019s character kills Chestnut, and none of this would have happened if he\u2019d just agreed to start a family, a lesson he learns in our next film.</p> <h2>When the Bough Breaks (2016)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws74Ie4fMc8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ws74Ie4fMc8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Let\u2019s all pretend for a moment that When the Bough Breaks stars Morris Chestnut\u2019s character from The Perfect Guy, reincarnated as pretty such the same dude, but with a chance to do it right this time. The new, improved Morris Chestnut has finally grown up, because now he wants a baby with his wife, Regina Hall. But they physically can\u2019t have a kid, so they have to get a surrogate. Wouldn\u2019t you know it, but the surrogate is a sex-crazed monster played by Jaz Sinclair from the movie Paper Towns. When the Bough Breaks cements the thot horror genre as about on the level with the Lifetime Original Movie, but instead of taking place in an east coast suburb full of white people, it features rich black people in the city. </p> <p>So what does the future hold for the thot horror genre hold? The cast of Empire needs something to do between seasons. I don\u2019t mean Taraji P Henson or Terrence Howard. I mean the kid who plays Hakeem. Why isn\u2019t he in one of these? He\u2019d be great at terrorizing a couple yuppies and threatening to steal their baby. Where is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2014/may/14/shonda-rhimes-scandal-tv-diversity-showrunner-davis\">Shonda Rhimes</a> in all of this? She should be cranking out evil side pieces once or twice a year. It\u2019s time that African Americans get their very own Basic Instinct \u2013 a completely unhinged erotic thriller that breaks through into the mainstream. The Oscars might still be so white, but HBO at 3am should be full of Morris Chestnut rebuking the advances of his nanny until the end of time.</p>",

  "<h2>1) Christian Pulisic should start against Mexico</h2> <p>Head coach J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann has friendlies against Cuba and New Zealand in October to fine-tune his line-up for the first Hexagonal game at home to Mexico in November, but it will be hard to leave out Pulisic for the showpiece 2018 World Cup qualifier based on his performances <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/06/usa-world-cup-trinidad-tobago-hex-jozy-altidore\">against Trinidad &amp; Tobago</a>, and St Vincent &amp; the Grenadines.</p> <p>It\u2019s not only his pacy, direct running but his speed of thought that impresses, and makes him seem far older than his 17 years (he\u2019s 18 in eleven days). Allied with solid technique, he has already shown he can score chances and create them. In his first international start he was not merely comfortable against Trinidad &amp; Tobago \u2013 he was the best player on the pitch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/06/usa-world-cup-trinidad-tobago-hex-jozy-altidore\">Altidore and Pulisic excel as USA clinch spot in the Hex with easy win over T&amp;T</a> </p> </aside>  <p>True, SVG and T&amp;T are hardly upper-tier opposition, but there\u2019s every reason to think that Pulisic could impress against tougher teams. He has the fearlessness that Klinsmann craves. The Borussia Dortmund man/boy also worked well with Fabian Johnson, which may reassure Klinsmann that he can continue to use the 28-year-old at the problem position of left back without entirely blunting his valuable attacking instincts.</p> <p>For consequential matches, Klinsmann has adopted a safety-first approach, preferring to pick what he believes is his best XI rather than opting to give his greenhorns work experience that would prove valuable down the line. While Pulisic is young enough to <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.com/team/united-states/660/blog/post/2944438/christian-pulisic-on-life-with-the-united-states-borussia-dortmund-and-being-a-justin-bieber-fan\">get excited about going to see Justin Bieber in concert</a>, he\u2019s also unquestionably one of the US\u2019s top 11 players. That, rather than fretting about whether Pulisic can handle the hype, should be the main guiding factor for Klinsmann when he selects his line-ups for the coming matches.</p> <h2>2) Mixed results up front</h2> <p>Jozy Altidore scored twice, and his first was a goal of some craftsmanship. Especially with Clint Dempsey absent because of <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/jurgen-klinsmann-thinks-clint-dempsey-will-be-fine-after-irregular-heartbeat-scare-090416\">tests for an irregular heartbeat</a>, Altidore\u2019s contribution was welcome \u2013 and his strikes saw him break Dempsey\u2019s all-time record for most USMNT World Cup qualifying goals, which had stood at 14. After he missed the Copa America Centenario through injury, it\u2019s easy to forget the key role the Toronto FC striker played for the US in the last Hex.</p> <p>Though he developed a good understanding with Pulisic, Altidore\u2019s partnership up front with Bobby Wood had all the chemistry of a busted Bunsen burner. It was jarring to see Wood looking ineffective, after his strong Copa, since T&amp;T were defensively weak and because he worked well enough with Altidore against SVG only last week. Jordan Morris replaced him off the bench on Tuesday and was bright; along with Gyasi Zardes, Klinsmann has decent options in attack - if he can fit the puzzle pieces together.</p> <h2>3) Sacha Kljestan\u2019s renaissance continues</h2> <p>Like many of his team-mates, Kljestan took a while to get going. When he did, scoring an opportunistic opening goal and looking lively in the second half, he underlined that his excellent club form with the New York Red Bulls has carried over to his unexpected return to the national team. Rewarded with a start following a notable cameo in St Vincent last Friday, against T&amp;T he outshone his fellow midfielders, Michael Bradley and Alejandro Bedoya, who had little impact. And his combination play with Pulisic was one reason why the teenager looked so good in the past two fixtures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/31/christian-pulisic-usa-soccer-copa-america-2016\">Christian Pulisic: the making of a young man ready to step up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kljestan was not even on the 40-man preliminary roster for June\u2019s Copa. Now, aged 30, is he ready to replicate his consistently good MLS performances at international level for a sustained period? And will Klinsmann give him the chance once Jermaine Jones is back from injury?</p> <h2>4) Who\u2019s in goal?</h2> <p>The meeting with the hapless Vincy Heat or the clash with T&amp;T \u2013 knowing that the US had (barring a miracle) already secured a berth in the Hexagonal qualification stage \u2013 might have seemed good opportunities to blood third-choice goalkeeper Ethan Horvath. The 21-year-old, who plays for Molde in Norway, has yet to win a senior international cap. Instead, we\u2019re left wondering who the preferred goalkeeper is, after Tim Howard played on Tuesday while Brad Guzan was between the posts last Friday. This in a position where it\u2019s normally considered optimal to have a clear first choice, especially behind a back four that has been chopped and changed.</p> <h2>5) Familiarity breeds victory</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ussoccer/status/773371584346193920\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheHex?src=hash\">#TheHex</a> schedule is set for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/USMNT?src=hash\">#USMNT</a>.

Still, the US Soccer Federation is leaving nothing to chance.

Ohio may be a political swing state, but it\u2019s safely red, white and blue when the US face Mexico: dating back to 2001, the US have played their rivals in four World Cup qualifiers at the home of the Crew and won each, 2-0. </p> <p>It\u2019s especially important to get off to a good start since what is likely to be the second-toughest road game, Costa Rica, follows only four days later, so a bad week would leave Klinsmann\u2019s side playing catch-up. Mexico host the US on 13 June.</p>",

  "<p>War-torn Syria\u2019s water supplies are deteriorating fast, triggering migration and disease and stoking a pollution crisis in neighbouring Lebanon, hydrologists and humanitarian groups have warned.<br></p> <p>\u201cWater security continues to deteriorate for many civilians [in Syria]. Evidence shows that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/02/water-key-conflict-iraq-syria-isis\">control over power and water</a> infrastructure is [being] used as a weapon of warring parties,\u201d said Noosheen Mogadam, a policy adviser with the Norwegian Refugee Council based in Gaziantep on the Turkish-Syrian border. </p> <p>\u201cConflict and protection concerns are the primary drivers for the current displacement trends, [but] a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/dec/27/war-syrian-water-digital-map-boreholes-icrc\">lack of access to water</a> is also cited as a major reason amongst both Syrian refugees and internally displaced people within Syria for fleeing their communities,\u201d she said.</p> <p>According to the UN refugee agency, 6.6 million people have been displaced internally in Syria due to the war and around 4.3 million people have fled to Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Europe in the last six years.<br></p> <p>\u201cDamaged [water] infrastructure, a lack of maintenance, and limited power supply has resulted in a 50% reduction in access to safe water [in Syria],\u201d said Mogadam.<br></p> <p>The environmental effects of the war are widely seen in neighbouring Lebanon which has received 1.8 million Syrian refugees in six years, said Nadim Farajalla, a professor of hydrology and water resources at the American University of Beirut. </p> <p>Lebanon, which has many rivers and water sources, is water-rich compared to Jordan, Israel or much of Syria. But the amount of renewable water available in the country has dropped from more than 1,000 cubic metres a year per person \u2013 considered the threshold of water poverty \u2013 to around 700m3 per person since the refugees arrived, Farajalla said.</p> <p>The extra pressure put on Lebanon\u2019s water supplies and sanitation is the equivalent of a sudden 30% increase in population and is now critical, he said. \u201cThis influx of people has had a severely negative impact ... with increasing demand on water, higher generation of sewage that goes untreated and an increase in solid waste that is often disposed of in dumps. All of this has put water resources in Lebanon under severe pressure \u2013 high demand coupled with increasing pollution,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cPeople just don\u2019t realise how critical Lebanon\u2019s water resources is. Refugees arriving when there was already a drought really killed us. The human tragedy is worsening, threatening the lives and the livelihoods of both refugees and their host communities through a resource that is supposed to be the source of life.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThe [water] situation is getting worse throughout the Middle East region,\u201d said Ashok Swain, director of the International Centre for Water Cooperation, who has co-authored a new book on emerging security threats in the Middle East.</p> <p>\u201cThe Middle East as a whole has the lowest per capita water availability in the world. At the same time it has also one of the highest rates of population growth. Governments have largely focused on water supply management, through desalination. Current co-operation over water resources is minimal. That needs to change,\u201d he said at a water conference in Stockholm.</p> <p>Co-author Dr Anders J\u00e4gerskog, water adviser to the Swedish government in Amman, Jordan, said water was an indirect security threat throughout the Middle East. \u201cMore attention needs to be paid to water, population, food and energy supplies. These are not direct security threats, like the Islamic State, but rather are growing behind the headlines and may contribute to more immediate threats in the years to come. Food availability, water scarcity and large population migration are all challenges that are set to increase in importance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"277bd67c299963a601fdbb4e9aa35eab674af995\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/277bd67c299963a601fdbb4e9aa35eab674af995/0_0_3771_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Syrian women till the fields in the drought-hit region of Hasaka in northeastern Syria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrian women till the fields in the drought-hit region of Hasaka in northeastern Syria, June 2010.

Water should be seen as one of many areas that can contribute to migration,\u201d said J\u00e4gerskog.</p> <p>Middle-East water researcher Francesca de Ch\u00e2tel said that the roots of the Syrian conflict were to be found in 50 years of Syria\u2019s mismanagement of water, the failure of intensive, irrigated wheat and cotton farming, and growing water scarcity.</p> <p>\u201cThe failure of largescale agricultural development projects from the 1950s onwards undermined farmers\u2019 livelihoods and dislocated rural communities. As rivers disappeared and wells ran dry after years of overexploitation, farmers abandoned their land and sought work in the big cities.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Japan\u2019s former prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/01/justinmccurry.theobserver\">Junichiro Koizumi</a> has labelled the country\u2019s current leader, Shinzo Abe, a \u201cliar\u201d for telling the international community that the situation at the wrecked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima\">Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant</a> is under control.</p> <p>Koizumi, who became one of Japan\u2019s most popular postwar leaders during his 2001-06 premiership, has used his retirement from frontline politics to become a leading campaigner against nuclear restarts in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan\">Japan</a> in defiance of Abe, a fellow conservative Liberal Democratic party (LDP) politician who was once regarded as his natural successor.</p> <p>Abe told members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in Buenos Aires in September 2013 that the situation at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was \u201cunder control\u201d, shortly before Tokyo was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/07/tokyo-host-2020-olympic-games\">awarded the 2020 Games</a>.</p> <p>IOC officials were concerned by reports about the huge build-up of contaminated water at the Fukushima site, more than two years after the disaster forced the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/08/japan-nuclear-disaster-fukushima-homes\">evacuation of tens of thousands of residents</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhen [Abe] said the situation was under control, he was lying,\u201d Koizumi told reporters in Tokyo. \u201cIt is not under control,\u201d he added, noting the problems the plant\u2019s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), has experienced with a costly subterranean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/13/doubts-giant-ice-wall-fukushima-nuclear-reactors\">ice wall</a> that is supposed to prevent groundwater from flowing into the basements of the damaged reactors, where it becomes highly contaminated.</p> <p>\u201cThey keep saying they can do it, but they can\u2019t,\u201d Koizumi said. He went on to claim that Abe had been fooled by industry experts who claim that nuclear is the safest, cleanest and cheapest form of energy for resource-poor Japan.</p> <p>\u201cHe believes what he\u2019s being told by nuclear experts,\u201d Koizumi said. \u201cI believed them, too, when I was prime minister. I think Abe understands the arguments on both sides of the debate, but he has chosen to believe the pro-nuclear lobby.\u201d</p> <p>After the Fukushima crisis, Koizumi said he had \u201cstudied the process, reality and history of the introduction of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/nuclearpower\">nuclear power</a>, and became ashamed of myself for believing such lies\u201d.</p> <p>Abe has pushed for the restart of Japan\u2019s nuclear reactors, while the government says it wants nuclear to account for a fifth of Japan\u2019s total energy mix by 2030. Just three of the country\u2019s dozens of nuclear reactors are in operation, and two will be taken offline later this year for maintenance.</p> <p>Koizumi, 74, has also thrown his support behind hundreds of US sailors and marines <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/aug/20/us-navy-sailors-legal-challenge-fukushima-radiation-tepco\">who claim they developed leukaemia and other serious health problems</a> after being exposed to Fukushima radiation plumes while helping with relief operations \u2013 nicknamed Operation Tomodachi (friend) \u2013 following the 11 March 2011 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan-earthquake-and-tsunami\">earthquake and tsunami</a>.</p> <p>In 2012 the service personnel launched a lawsuit accusing Tepco of failing to prevent the accident and of lying about the levels of radiation from the stricken reactors, putting US personnel at risk.</p> <p>Most of the 400 plaintiffs were aboard the USS Ronald Reagan, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier that was anchored off Japan\u2019s north-east coast while helicopters flew emergency supplies to survivors of the tsunami, which killed almost 19,000 people.</p> <p>Medical experts, however, said the sailors would have received only small, non-harmful doses of radiation; a US defence department report published in 2014 said no link had been established between the sailors\u2019 health problems and their exposure to low doses of Fukushima radiation.</p> <p>Koizumi, who met several of the sick servicemen in San Diego in May, plans to raise $1m by the end of next March to help cover the sailors\u2019 medical expenses.</p> <p>\u201cI felt I had to do something to help those who worked so hard for Japan,\u201d he said. \u201cThat won\u2019t be enough money, but at least it will show that Japan is grateful for what they did for us.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his opposition to Abe\u2019s pro-nuclear policies, Koizumi was complimentary about his performance as prime minister during his second time in office in the past decade.</p> <p>\u201cAs far as nuclear power is concerned, we are totally at odds,\u201d Koizumi said. \u201cBut I think he\u2019s reflected on the mistakes he made during his first time as leader and is doing a much better job second time around.\u201d</p> <p>In political longevity terms, Abe\u2019s performance could hardly be worse.

We\u2019ve already admired the foyer, decked out with an Edwardian railway saloon bar and piles of battered suitcases. In the theatre itself, the audience is split in two by a long, narrow stage \u2013 principally used as a platform, but cleverly designed (by <a href=\"http://www.joannascotcher.com/\">Joanna Scotcher</a>) with movable sections that are pushed by stagehands who seem to double as rail workers. The show, directed by Damian Cruden, proves as sophisticated in its storytelling as its stagecraft.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f6bc1d9550e607e54f2d9b8e944a1ae76867862a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6bc1d9550e607e54f2d9b8e944a1ae76867862a/0_0_3456_5184/667.jpg\" alt=\"The power of red petticoats \u2026 The Railway Children.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The power of red petticoats \u2026 The Railway Children.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Railway Children is the longest, and most grownup, film that Aggie has watched and she\u2019s enjoyed a young readers\u2019 version of E Nesbit\u2019s original book, so already knows the story of the three children who relocate to the Yorkshire countryside with their mother and struggle to make ends meet after their father is mysteriously taken away. It\u2019s framed here by adapter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jun/09/fairytale-childrens-theatre-rapunzel\">Mike Kenny</a> as a memory play: the central trio, Bobbie, Peter and Phyllis, appear first as adult characters, looking back at the events, before the same actors make the slightest of costume adjustments to become children again. Throughout the course of the play, they intermittently resume the role of adult narrators. Aggie likes the way they are telling their own story \u2013 and while none of this young audience really knows what the \u201cfourth wall\u201d is, Kenny knows how much fun it can be for kids when it\u2019s broken to bits. We\u2019re told to imagine events they can\u2019t stage and look away from painful episodes, then we\u2019re sent off to recuperate with an interval ice-cream after Bobbie faints on the track.</p> <p>As a big sister herself, Aggie\u2019s favourite character in the book is Bobbie \u2013 played brilliantly here by Sophie Ablett \u2013 but she especially enjoys Beth Lilly\u2019s spirited performance as Phyllis. Kenny potently explores the essence of community but particularly brings out that childhood muddle of making sense of grownups\u2019 coded world, and highlights the children\u2019s hope, bravery and resourcefulness as they stay strong while the cracks appear in their family life. Along the way, composer Christopher Madin\u2019s score is rightfully wistful rather than sentimental.<br></p> <p>So what of Justin? Early on, he has a well-judged routine in which he strides in slow motion alongside the children\u2019s carriage, employing a handful of regional accents to play various station masters, conveying their journey north to Yorkshire. In the interval, he balances a broom on his chin and gets whoops of approval from Aggie and the rest of the audience. But it\u2019s not an outsized performance and, suiting the play\u2019s theme, is part of a harmonious ensemble. And, to the children\u2019s delight, it turns out that the show-stealing turn comes from a real steam locomotive, built in the 1890s, whose appearances are genuinely moving.</p> <ul> <li>Justin Fletcher stars in <a href=\"https://www.railwaychildrenlondon.com/\">The Railway Children</a>, at King\u2019s Cross theatre, until 30 October.

Emotionally he is a Peter Pan \u2013 the boy who never grew up.</p> <p>\u201cAnd this disagreement between us was just about wind turbines! Imagine the consequences if similar phone calls were taking place from the oval office, not Trump tower, and the subject matter was not wind power but hard power \u2013 the use or deployment of military force and nuclear weaponry.\u201d</p> <p>Salmond urged the Democrats to repeat their \u201cDaisy\u201d attack advert used against Goldwater. \u201cIt shows a lovely young girl counting daisy petals from one to 10, which then morphs into a countdown to a nuclear strike from 10 to one. Its purpose was to highlight the danger of a Goldwater presidency,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>\u201cAs this presidential campaign now reaches its climax, they should consider using such an approach again.</p> <p>\u201cBecause while many disgruntled Americans are still attracted to the Trump anti-establishment, anti-Washington, anti-big government rhetoric there are only a few who want to risk a manchild in the White House.</p> <p>\u201cThe truth is indeed out there because: \u2018In your guts you know he\u2019s nuts\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Salmond\u2019s distaste for Trump\u2019s Islamophobic and anti-migrant rhetoric is not new.

Founder clubs of Division Three include QPR, Reading, Swindon Town, Bristol Rovers and Newport County.

Nice little package, if you will. Back in 1895, when the northern clubs broke away, to take the train from Hull (the most easterly) to Widnes (the most westerly) would have taken in 21 of 22, with only (I think) Stockport having presented any major deviation. In fact, the clubs were initially meeting at a pub called The Spread Eagle in Manchester, deemed the central point for all 22 members, However, on the date of the meeting at which the Northern clubs broke from the Southern Union, The Spread Eagle was double-booked, presumably for some sort of Victorian-era darts match or shove ha\u2019penny championship, so the honour of the foundation point went to The George Hotel in Huddersfield.

Vlaar, Darius Vassell and Olof Mellberg have all tried since then and ended up wishing they hadn\u2019t. In fact, the only Villa players ever to score for their country in a shootout are David Platt v West Germany in 1990 and Tony Cascarino, who scuffed an effort into the net for the Republic of Ireland against Romania at the 1990 World Cup only three months after becoming Villa\u2019s record signing (incidentally, his tally of 11 goals in 46 matches for Villa means Cascarino could also be in the running as a decent answer to the next question, below). Jean II Makoun scored for Cameroon in their epic 12-11 shootout victory over Ivory Coast at the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations but that, of course, was when the midfielder was at Lille, five years before he became a Villan.</p> <p>As for the English club with the most prolific scorers in international shootouts, that is Arsenal (14), with Chelsea (10) second, although Chelsea players have also been responsible for five misses, more than any other English club \u2013 but not quite as many as AC Milan, whose players have managed to miss 10 times in international tournaments (and only score nine times). The club with the most successful takers, meanwhile, is Barcelona, with 21 successful spot-kicks (and five misses).</p> <p><em>As a quick update to this, we can confirm the record still stands. The closest we can get is Jordan Ayew\u2019s successful kick for Ghana in the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations final against Ivory Coast.

I repeat that if there are falsities, and if these people cannot prove in court what they have claimed is true, then they will have to bear responsibility for it.</p> <p>\u201cThose who also assist in publicising such false information, those who produce it, broadcast and rebroadcast it \u2013 the Defamation and Freedom of Expression Act as well as other such laws provide measures to take legal action against them.\u201d</p> <p>It is not disputed that the statement related to the documentary, or that it could also serve as an indirect warning to Maldives citizens that they could be prosecuted for working with the documentary team. </p> <p>The Maldives government believes it is proper to warn its citizens they will face action if they contribute to a broadcast it says contains a number of untrue and highly defamatory allegations about the government.</p> <p>Manik\u2019s statement was followed the the next day by a report on state media saying a screening of the documentary had been cancelled. </p> <p>The article also attacked the al-Jazeera producer leading the documentary, Will Jordan, who is a former editor of the Maldives Independent, an English-language publication accused of being friendly with the country\u2019s opposition movements.</p> <p>The article read: \u201cEven before producing this documentary, which was produced to defame this Maldives, non-Muslim Will Jordan and his team had conducted special campaigns to starve Maldivian citizens, by preventing tourists and investors from coming to the Maldives.\u201d</p> <p>A death threat against Jordan has also been reported to the Metropolitan police though there is no evidence that the person making the threat is linked to the government.<br></p> <p>Jordan received a tweet on 3 August reading: \u201cU will die soon. We have hired some gunmens to shot u. &amp; we r not afraid of fucking anyone or any country. See the bullet\u201d, followed by a gun emoji.</p> <p>Al-Jazeera has also cancelled a screening of the documentary at the Royal Society of Arts in London. It is understood the RSA was contacted by lawyers acting on behalf of the Maldives government concerning the documentary, however the decision to cancel the screening was made by the broadcaster.</p> <p> </p> <p> Al-Jazeera investigative journalism director, Clayton Swisher, said the network would not back down from airing the documentary.</p> <p>\u201cWe are aware of the majority leader of the Maldives ruling party appearing on state TV just days ago to warn the island nation that anyone who contributed or helped with al-Jazeera\u2019s investigation would face a serious crackdown,\u201d he said. \u201cOur local contacts there indicate these remarks have left a large number of citizens concerned.\u201d</p> <p> He also claimed that two journalists from Italy and Poland had been detained on suspicion of working with the documentary makers, though al-Jazeera had assured the government that they were not working with the pair.</p> <p> Swisher added: \u201cThat\u2019s more than enough evidence for us that fixers and journalists \u2013 including ones who assist al-Jazeera \u2013 face risk in the Maldives for doing their jobs. And it is our duty to support those who share these risks in the common cause of investigative journalism.\u201d</p> <p>The Maldives government said that the journalists concerned were working illegally on a tourist visa which fell foul of Maldivian immigration law. </p> <p>In a statement it added: \u201cThe government of the Maldives is shocked and disappointed to learn that journalists involved in the production of the al-Jazeera documentary \u2018Stealing Paradise\u2019 have allegedly been subjected to intimidation. The government takes this allegation extremely seriously and under no circumstances condones such behaviour. The government is, and will continue to be, committed to a free and independent press.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Are Washington now the standard bearer in the NFC East? </strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s nothing that captures the decline of the NFC East quite like pondering whether a Dan Snyder-run franchise is the best in the division. But after being the froth that rose to the top of the NFC East bowl last year at 9-7, Washington have made moves to try to win the division again.</p> <p>They picked up the biggest name in the offseason by signing former Panthers Pro Bowl cornerback and all-world trash talker Josh Norman. He\u2019ll help immensely improve a pass defense that was ranked 25th in the NFL last season, as will free agent safety David Bruton and early-round defensive back draft picks Su\u2019a Cravens and Kendall Fuller. On offense, Washington boast perhaps the division\u2019s most stable quarterback-coach combo in Kirk Cousins and Jay Gruden. Cousins had a breakout year in 2015 and rendered former franchise savior Robert Griffin III expendable, while Gruden went 9-7 and made the playoffs in his second year as a head coach. Compare that to the Eagles with Carson Wentz and Doug Pederson, the Giants with Eli Manning and unknown commodity Ben McAdoo, and the Cowboys with Tony Romo\u2019s carcass/Dak Prescott and Jason Garrett, the answer to the question: \u201cWho would Jeff Fisher be if he had red hair?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/06/nfc-west-preview-seattle-seahawks-los-angeles-rams-jared-goff\">NFC West preview: is No1 pick Jared Goff already a bust for the Rams?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unless Cousins proves to be the latest Washington QB to have been a one-season wonder, the only thing that could keep Snyder\u2019s creation from the top of NFC East is the much more difficult schedule the team will face in 2016. While Washington got to feast on a last place schedule in 2015, this year they get the Cardinals and Panthers along with the AFC North and NFC North. It will be difficult to improve on 2015\u2019s 9-7 record. But in the NFC East, a repeat of last season could be enough to make Washington the division\u2019s first repeat winner since the Eagles controlled things from 2001 to 2004. And then the Giants, Cowboys and Eagles ownership will have to face the harsh reality of being worse than Snyder.</p> <h2><strong>Is Tony Romo\u2019s injury a blessing in disguise? </strong></h2> <p>The Cowboys entered training camp fancying themselves a Super Bowl contender because that\u2019s what Jerry Jones believes the team he\u2019s built is every year, 20-year periods with just two playoff wins total be damned. But few not wearing blue-tinted, star-framed glasses really saw the Cowboys as a championship threat this year even if Romo miraculously made it the entire year without once grabbing at his back or collarbone while prone on the field. The Cowboys were 4-12 last year, 1-7 at home and had the fourth-worst points differential in the entire NFL. They were not one healthy Romo away from lifting the Lombardi Trophy. And this season, in addition to missing Romo, the Cowboys will open without defensive players DeMarcus Lawrence, Randy Gregory and Rolando McClain due to suspension. Super Bowl favorites they are not. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/31/nfc-north-preview-teddy-bridgewater-minnesota-vikings\">NFC North preview: are the Vikings doomed without Teddy Bridgewater?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So while Romo being out again for six to 10 weeks is no one\u2019s definition of a good thing, the Cowboys could use his latest injury to lay the groundwork to become a good thing. Fourth round pick Dak Prescott showed promise in the preseason and he\u2019ll start the season at quarterback alongside fellow rookie Ezekiel Elliott, the team\u2019s first-round running back selection out of Ohio State. That\u2019s the start of a potentially exciting youth movement. Receivers Dez Bryant and Terrance Williams are still only in their mid-20s, too, meaning the Cowboys may have fallen into an offensive core that could be the face of the franchise for five years or more. Romo will be able to play again in October or November, but the Cowboys will have to decide if playing him is worth delaying a promising future for another run with a disappointing past. </p> <h2><strong>Can Ben McAdoo bring the Giants some consistency? </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"641ed5ac7692cdbd0c29da06c465b0e13f423d17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/641ed5ac7692cdbd0c29da06c465b0e13f423d17/0_297_5015_3009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr talk tactics\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr talk tactics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Hoffman/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Giants finally decided to get off the Tom Coughlin rollercoaster in January. After 12 seasons and two Super Bowl titles surrounded by disappointment and letdowns, the franchise moved on. What we don\u2019t yet know is if the Giants rollercoaster will continue with him gone. Maybe it was Eli Manning and the rest of the Giants veterans who were driving it all along, the true cause of every twist and turn and jaw-dropping fourth quarter defeat. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/afc-south-preview-andrew-luck-indianapolis-colts-nfl\">AFC South questions for 2016: can Andrew Luck drag the Colts to the postseason?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Onto the sideline grass Coughlin wore down with his incessant pacing steps Ben McAdoo, the team\u2019s offensive coordinator since 2014. He is credited with bringing some consistency to Manning\u2019s game over the last two years. The NFL\u2019s last remaining Manning had maybe his best overall season in 2015, yet the Giants still finished 6-10 and saw their coach forced out. So while Manning was to blame for some Giants collapses in years past, in 2015 it was the last-ranked defense that seemingly blew a fourth quarter lead in every loss. Here McAdoo chose consistency and retained defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo. He\u2019ll try to keep his job with a revamped defensive line featuring free agent acquisitions Olivier Vernon and Damon Harrison and the addition of first-round cornerback selection Eli Apple. The Giants don\u2019t need a worst-to-first performance from their defense; just a worst-to-21st will keep them in the mix in the NFC East. If that doesn\u2019t happen, McAdoo will be <a href=\"http://blacksportsonline.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/coughlin.jpg\">making Coughlin faces soon enough</a>.</p> <h2><strong>What are the Eagles doing? </strong></h2> <p>The Eagles and Browns are among the group of NFL franchises never to have won a Super Bowl. All ultimate failure is not created equal, however. While the Browns have long been a punchline, the Eagles have been more or less competitive for a generation. But Philadelphia are very much trending towards punchline status over the last year. <br></p> <p>After overreacting to Chip Kelly\u2019s first two semi-successful years on the job and handing him player personnel control, the Eagles overreacted again after the disastrous 2015 season and didn\u2019t simply bust him back to being head coach only, but canned him completely. Then, instead of bringing a young and exciting coach or a proven veteran winner, they decided to try to recreate the Andy Reid years by hiring longtime Reid deputy and former Eagles backup QB Doug Pederson. It was the generic brand vanilla ice cream of coaching hires and Pederson has done absolutely nothing since taking the job to build confidence that he can restore the \u201cglory\u201d of the Reid years or even reach the 10-6 heights that Kelly took the Eagles to twice. <br></p> <p>The journey into the NFL abyss continued at the draft when Philadelphia gave up a ransom to get the No2 overall pick so they could take quarterback Carson Wentz, who is about as far from a sure-thing as Philadelphia is from North Dakota. And now, after a preseason that saw Wentz struggle and get injured, the Eagles have traded Sam Bradford and handed Wentz the starting job \u2013 a job that will put him behind an offensive line without suspended tackle Lane Johnson, and surround him with skill position players lacking a single legitimate star to bail him out.</p> <p>Maybe Wentz has the talent and make-up to develop into a quality NFL quarterback if he\u2019s handled properly at the start of his career. But dropping him into week one with little help around him is putting him on a bust path. That\u2019s if he doesn\u2019t just get broken in half before his first NFL series ends. Unfortunately for Eagles fans, this season won\u2019t end soon enough.</p> <p><strong>Projected records: </strong><br></p> <p>1=) Washington: 9-7<br></p> <p>1=) Giants: 9-7</p> <p>3) Cowboys: 6-10</p> <p>4) Eagles: 3-13</p>",

In a passage that was remarkable for a Republican less than eight years after George W Bush left office, Trump condemned democracy promotion overseas. \u201cI believe in a foreign policy based on our national interests that focuses on American security and regional stability instead of using our military to create democracies in countries with no democratic history and couldn\u2019t care less about democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to force democracy down their throats and they don\u2019t even want it.\u201d</p> <p>At a town hall earlier on Tuesday, Trump criticized the US intervention in Libya as part of Nato in 2011. There, he said \u201cthis was a Hillary Clinton deal. We could have had a minor attack.\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-claims-he-didnt-support-libya-intervention-but-he-did\">supported the intervention</a> at the time.</p> <p>The attack on Clinton\u2019s interventionist foreign policy came the night before Trump will hold a major address on defense policy in Philadelphia. He is expected to call for the end of the sequester and a significant increase in military spending. He is also expected to condemn Clinton\u2019s foreign policy of regime change and democracy promotion.</p> <p>In addition to policy, Trump used much of his speech to give a fervent indictment of the ongoing controversy of Clinton\u2019s emails, which he said was \u201cworse than Watergate\u201d. In his view, \u201cWe can\u2019t have someone in Oval Office who doesn\u2019t know meaning of words \u2018confidential\u2019 or \u2018classified\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Trump condemned Clinton\u2019s use of the software BleachBit to wipe her servers \u2013 \u201cshe bleached her emails\u201d \u2013 and raised questions about a Clinton aide destroying her discarded phones with a hammer. \u201cWho uses 13 different iPhones in four years?,\u201d Trump asked. \u201cThe only people who use that many phones are usually involved in very, very \u2013 I mean very \u2013 shady activity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fe30b402afb42c89ca12c0d47da02a20fd6c948\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fe30b402afb42c89ca12c0d47da02a20fd6c948/0_17_2837_1703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump gestures to supporters at the campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump gestures to supporters at the campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump also suggested that something ominous had happened to Bryan Pagliano, the IT worker who maintained Clinton\u2019s server and invoked the fifth amendment in lieu of testifying to Congress on the matter. \u201cHe pleaded the fifth and where is he? We never heard about him again,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>As Trump summed it up: \u201cIn history there has never been a situation like what\u2019s going on with Justice and Hillary Clinton. There has never been a situation like what\u2019s going with the media and Hillary Clinton.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also continued to compare Clinton to German chancellor Angela Merkel, calling her \u201cAmerica\u2019s Merkel\u201d and saw potential parallels in Merkel\u2019s party losing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/mecklenburg-vorpommern-german-anti-immigrant-party-strong-regional-election-exit-polls-merkel\">regional elections in Germany on Sunday</a>. \u201cSee what happened to Angela Merkel? They had a massive defeat recently in the elections.\u201d</p> <p>Trump did outline one new policy detail at the rally. The Republican nominee pledged that, if elected, \u201cI am also going to notify all countries that refuse to take back dangerous illegal immigrants that they will lose access to our visa programs and many more little goodies.\u201d Losing access to US visa program would effectively mean that residents of those countries would not be able to visit the US for any reason.</p> <p>He tied the issue to risk from immigrants committing crimes, in particular Syrian refugees whom he once again called \u201ca Trojan horse\u201d. Unusually, Trump thought about history in expressing his concern about a potential threat from those fleeing the Syrian civil war. \u201cIn 200 years, 400 years, I don\u2019t want people to be reading about it or talking about it,\u201d said Trump.</p> <p>Trump also pledged that he would have the US military submit a plan to defeat Isis within 30 days of taking office. This marked a shift from <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/donald-trump-i-know-how-to-defeat-isis-but-im-not-gonna-tell-yet/\">his statement</a> in May 2015, before he formally announced his candidacy, that he already had a plan to defeat Isis but that he wanted to keep it secret because: \u201cI don\u2019t want the enemy to know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to his speech on defense policy on Wednesday, Trump is also scheduled to address the presidential convention of the Conservative party in New York City and participate in a televised forum with NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer.</p>",

Over 20,000 Russians, the demographic Goa recently relied on, have cancelled trips. The collapsing rouble and problems in the eurozone are external factors that partly explain the disappearing foreign tourist, but Goa doesn\u2019t help itself. In an IndyaWire.com social media survey, <a href=\"http://indyawire.com/42-per-cent-former-russian-tourists-to-goa-do-not-want-to-come-back-again-says-indyawire-com-russia-survey/\">42% of Russians who had visited in the last four years said they wouldn\u2019t be coming back</a>: Goa was too expensive, too dirty, the taxi mafia too aggressive, women didn\u2019t feel safe, the police were unco-operative.</p> <p>Anecdotal evidence supports claims of increased harassment of women. A chef friend from Chandigarh, who worked late in a restaurant, had to switch from a scooter to a car because she was being stalked on her way home. An Italian woman here for 10 days stopped travelling alone after a man tried to force her off her bike at night. And a Californian friend who has lived in India for more than 30 years told me about a new bag snatching gang targeting single females travelling alone in the evenings. Little by little, the foreigners who have settled here, the ones who made the parties and the markets come alive, are going elsewhere.</p> <p>But hey \u2026 good riddance? We don\u2019t need you? Domestic tourism will pick up the shortfall \u2013 after all, it rose 35% between 2013 and 2014. Here\u2019s the rub, though: aside from dramatically altering a place that, in the words of one friend, \u201chas been geared toward foreigners for 40 years\u201d, the bulk of this incoming demographic doesn\u2019t bring much money to the local economy. They generally arrive by the jeep- or coach-load, stay in budget hotels or in their own vehicles, cook their own food if they can or eat all-inclusive, generate huge amounts of garbage and leave.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a rush toward low-quality, pack-em-in resorts, at great environmental cost.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Revenues are falling.

Occasionally, they become sinister. In the popular Indian imagination, the liberal, laid-back Goa that accepted the hippies all those years ago is a den of sin, a land of sex, drugs and drink, where anything goes. And so it has become. When my husband went to photograph Calangute beach recently, a pimp approached him within five minutes, \u201cYou want to fuck nice girls?\u201d he whispered, while the police sat a few feet away.</p> <p>It\u2019s a rush toward low-quality, pack-em-in resorts, at great environmental cost. Which is funny, as the Goa government has been talking about high-end tourism for years. It was always its plan: get rid of the hippies and bring in the high-rollers. That\u2019s what the then chief minister Manohar Parrikar told me when I interviewed him in 2004. Well, they got rid of the hippies. And the high-end tourists? Surprise! They\u2019re not coming. But they will, according to the government; they\u2019ll come as soon as the Panaji to Reis Magos Ropeway is built.

  "<p>Before the last election I shared a train journey with Ed Miliband and some of his advisers on their way to a live television debate. The conversation turned to mugs. Labour had produced a range emblazoned with campaign pledges, and one offering \u201ccontrols on immigration\u201d had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/29/diane-abbott-labour-immigration-controls-mugs-shameful\" title=\"\">angered the left of the party</a>.</p> <p>Miliband was puzzled and frustrated. The promise to manage the nation\u2019s borders followed logically from the impossibility of fighting an election on a manifesto implying the opposite. Who would advocate uncontrolled immigration? Besides, it was hardly the centrepiece of the campaign. Why get so hung up on one pledge when there were four others that the left should be cheering \u2013 protecting the NHS, for example, and raising living standards? There were mugs for those too.</p> <p>But the problem wasn\u2019t the mug so much as the ease with which an empty political vessel is filled with scepticism. No one who resented Labour for lax border policy in the past was impressed by a slogan of control; and anyone who found that kind of rhetoric distasteful was appalled that Labour should be borrowing it. One side doubted that Miliband meant what he said; the other side hoped he didn\u2019t. He paid the maximum price in perceived inauthenticity, for no return in votes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/05/the-guardian-view-on-eu-migration-after-brexit-may-must-tell-us-what-she-wants\">The Guardian view on EU migration after Brexit: May must tell us what she wants | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With immigration, perhaps more than any other policy area, the credentials of the messenger matter as much as the message. There is more space for consensus than is apparent in a polarised debate. Public attitude surveys find little support for the open-door approach, but also limited interest in raising drawbridges. Most people recognise that migrants make a valuable contribution to British society and always have done, but they also fret about the pressure put on public services \u2013 and, in some sectors, wages \u2013 by new arrivals. Many also find rapid change in the cultural contours of their neighbourhoods disorienting. Those are not unreasonable concerns, and the surest way to provoke mistrust is to conflate them with racist attitudes.</p> <p>The point is made well and with reference to detailed polling in a <a href=\"http://www.britishfuture.org/articles/less-racist-anxious/\" title=\"\">report \u2013 published in 2014</a> but still fresh with insight \u2013 from British Future, a thinktank specialising in matters of migration and identity. The authors identify an \u201canxious middle\u201d, comprising around half the population, who simultaneously value ethnic diversity and mourn a loss of cultural continuity. They are flanked by roughly equal 25% tranches of \u201cmigration liberals\u201d on one side and \u201crejectionists\u201d on the other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bf62c9d14b163bc44e2443055f0f42a0dca7e6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bf62c9d14b163bc44e2443055f0f42a0dca7e6e/0_0_620_372/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Miliband\u2019s immigration mug.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Miliband\u2019s immigration mug.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Labour</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A routine failure among politicians and commentators on the liberal wing is to treat the anxiety of the middle as a shade of rejectionism \u2013 either closet prejudice or a naive susceptibility to that tendency. Having diagnosed the problem as misinformation spread by the enemies of tolerance, they treat it with \u201cmyth-busting\u201d cures, hoping that a blast of cold logic might dispel the miasma of false consciousness.</p> <p>But to someone made anxious by personal experience, myth-busting comes across either as an accusation of stupidity (\u201cyou don\u2019t understand the issues\u201d) or a symptom of elite arrogance (\u201cyour unhappiness is a price worth paying for my continued economic success\u201d).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With immigration, perhaps more than any policy area, the credentials of the messenger matter as much as the message</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is a blind spot on the other side too, exemplified by those Conservative Brexiteers who fought a campaign promising simple immigration solutions, and now plead for time, citing the complexity of their task. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/16/johnson-davis-fox-three-brexiteers\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson, Liam Fox, David Davis</a> \u2013 the cabinet ministers responsible for engineering a post-EU settlement of Britain\u2019s relations \u2013 might be appalled at the suggestion they pander to racism, and yet this triumvirate owes its position to an electoral project that mobilised all the racists.</p> <p>Of course not everyone who voted for Brexit is xenophobic, but xenophobes voted leave; and to pretend that the campaign did not give licence to casual bigotry, with an undercurrent of violent menace, defies decency and evidence.</p> <p>Leave campaigners packaged up their answers to the border question as \u201can Australian-style points system\u201d.

So not really taking control at all. It was designed not to reduce numbers but to increase the population of Australia by importing labour and it succeeded in that aim, as the Brexit bunch knew all along.</p> <p>The \u201cpoints-based system\u201d was always a phoney offer. It was clever shorthand for \u201cnon-racist yet rigorous-sounding alternative to the status quo\u201d, chosen because it seemed meritocratic (points are earned) and culturally digestible (Australia is a friendly, Anglophone cousin country). It was no more viable as a device for containing public anxiety about immigration than Miliband\u2019s mug, albeit with more retail appeal. Nor did it much improve on David Cameron\u2019s commitment to cap net migrant numbers \u2013 a pledge with the dubious honour of being even more politically cynical and less practically attainable than George Osborne\u2019s fiscal targets.</p> <p>Thus are we confronted with the Conservative Eurosceptics, tongue-tied but blinking smugly in the glare of referendum victory, holding a blank piece of paper where they should have answers on immigration.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/16/johnson-davis-fox-three-brexiteers\">Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox as the Three Brexiteers?

At the other end, Kenwyne Jones flailed a shot dismally wide when clear on the right side of the penalty area.</p> <p>With almost an hour gone and T&amp;T a growing threat against a back line that never looked fully secure, the US scored their second when Altidore collected the ball on the edge of the box and steered a sly finish low beyond Phillip. The 26-year-old Toronto FC man quickly had another, an adroit cross from Pulisic giving him a simple task at the far post.</p> <p>With 71 minutes gone, Pulisic almost finished a move he started, but Phillip saved his shot and Paul Arriola, a substitute, found the net on the rebound.</p> <p>Clean through in stoppage time, Altidore blew his chance for a hat-trick, chipping the ball over the bar, but it hardly mattered as the US impressively maintained their unbeaten home record in World Cup qualifiers since 2001 and handed the visitors their first loss of the stage. The Hex brings something of a re-set, but there was a fluency and potency in attack in this match that the US will want to replicate in the coming months as they seek to secure their place in Russia. </p>",

coverage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">this US election cycle</a>, we realized that this was already happening: people wanted to know what the situation looked like from outside and inside the US, and they had some real questions about what exactly is going on.</p> <p>And hey, we did too: we asked readers who live outside the US to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/us-voters-2016-election-international-perspective\">ask some questions</a> of our American audience. We also asked our American readers to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/what-would-you-ask-us-citizens-about-clinton-trump-and-the-election\"> come up with a list</a> for readers abroad. Hundreds of people submitted. We read all of the responses, then edited them into the list below.</p> <p>The next step is getting some answers. This too will come back to our readers: AKA, you.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a US citizen, answer as many of the questions posed by our international readers as you\u2019d like. If you\u2019re not a US citizen, answer as many of the questions posed by our US citizens as you\u2019d like \u2013 just scroll down to find them.

He was criticized by Arizona senator Jeff Flake, who called his speech \u201cconfusing\u201d and said it was unrealistic to remove the estimated 11 million people living in the US without documents. </p> <p>In the interview, McCain appeared to disagree with that assessment.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2019 not doable is rounding up 11 million people and putting them across the southern border,\u201d McCain said. \u201cThat\u2019s not doable and, of course, not to mention what it would do in many other aspects.

This arbitrary number was put in place the year after third-party candidate Jesse Ventura won the governorship of Minnesota. Ventura was included in debates when he was at 10% in the polls, and his performance carried him to victory.

It also calls on the international community for urgent action to protect child migrants; end detention for children seeking refugee status or migrating; keep families together; and provide much-needed education and health services for children migrants. <br></p> <p>\u201cThough many communities and people around the world have welcomed refugee and migrant children, xenophobia, discrimination, and exclusion pose serious threats to their lives and futures,\u201d said Unicef\u2019s executive director, Anthony Lake.</p> <p>\u201cBut if young refugees are accepted and protected today, if they have the chance to learn and grow, and to develop their potential, they can be a source of stability and economic progress.\u201d</p> <p>Today children comprise one-eighth of all international migrants in the world (31 million children out of 244 million total migrants), according to 2015 data. The vast majority of child migrants \u2013 some 3.7 million children \u2013 live in the US, followed by Saudi Arabia and Jordan, while in Europe, the UK hosts the largest number of migrants under the age of 18 (close to 750,000).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-06T14:15:24/embed.html\" data-alt=\"The vast majority of child migrants live in the U\u200bnited States\u200b, followed by Saudi Arabia and Jordan\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-06T14:15:24/embed.html\">The vast majority of child migrants live in the U\u200bnited States\u200b, followed by Saudi Arabia and Jordan</a> </figure>  <p>Unicef UK is calling on the UK government to step up action to ensure that refugee children stranded in Europe can reach safety with their families in the UK. </p> <p>\u201cToday, nearly one in every 200 children in the world is a refugee,\u201d said Lily Caprani, Unicef UK\u2019s deputy executive director. \u201cIn the last few years we have seen huge numbers of children being forced to flee their homes, and take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/13/safe-memories-children-traumatised-by-escape-to-europe-ritsona-camp-greece\">dangerous, desperate journeys</a>, often on their own. Children on the move are at risk of the worst forms of abuse and harm and can easily fall victim to traffickers and other criminals.</p> <p>\u201cMany of these children wouldn\u2019t resort to such extreme measures if the UK government made them aware that they may have a legal right to come to the UK safely, and if they provided the resources to make that process happen before these terrible journeys begin.\u201d</p> <p>The vast majority of the world\u2019s child migrants live in Asia or Africa, the report says. Asia is the birthplace of nearly half (43%) of all the migrants in the world, with nearly 60% of these migrants moving within the region. Most of Asia\u2019s child migrants are hosted in Saudi Arabia, which also receives the highest number of labour migrants \u2013 the report\u2019s authors say more research is needed to understand the connection between the two. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Globally, Turkey has the largest share of refugees \u2013 including adults \u2013 under protection by the UNHCR, and is believed to host the most child refugees as well. </p> <p>In Africa, nearly one in three migrants is a child \u2013 nearly twice the global average \u2013 and three in five refugees are children. African migrants move both within and beyond the continent\u2019s borders in nearly equal numbers; South Africa and Ivory Coast are the top two host countries for immigrants. But on-going conflict in many countries, in addition to linguistic difficulties between peoples and extremely limited resources to deal with migrant and refugee populations, mean that \u201cthe economic and social pressures of hosting threaten to uproot refugees once more\u201d, the report warns. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/14/thousands-of-migrant-refugee-children-travelling-alone-from-africa-to-europe-says-unicef\">Thousands of children travelling alone from Africa to Europe, says Unicef</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Understanding how and why children move within or beyond their birth countries is hugely important but usually hidden from view, says Dale Rutstein of Unicef\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.unicef-irc.org/\">Office of Research \u2013 Innocenti</a>, which is investigating the multiple drivers that push children to start new lives, and the problems that they face as a result.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe systems we have in place for people fleeing or seeking asylum are focused on adults, and in no way are articulated for children,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are usually based on border control and law enforcement, yet we know that detention for a child is the worst thing that can happen and can create significant problems [for] a child\u2019s development. But time and time again, we see that states don\u2019t have any system for [holding] children apart from [putting them in] detention.\u201d</p> <p>Data clearly shows that refugee and migrant children disproportionately face poverty and exclusion despite being in great need of aid and resources, and in many circumstances are required to handle their own legal cases as they lack any form of legal representation.</p> <p>\u201cIn many parts of the world, children are often and regularly in court proceedings where they have no legal representative and no adult representation, most notably on the border between Central America and the US,\u201d says Rutstein.</p> <p>\u201cThink of how absurd it is for a child to be arguing their case against a government-appointed lawyer. Often states believe they are set up to protect \u2018their own\u2019 children, but children have to be children anywhere and everywhere, and need to have the same standard forms of protection and treatment [around the world].\u201d</p> <p>The report calls on the international community to fulfil the <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx\">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/rightsite/433_468.htm\">most widely ratified human rights treaty in history</a>, which obliges ratifying countries to respect and protect the rights of all children within their territories, regardless of a child\u2019s background or migration status. While legal frameworks protecting refugees and other adult migrants is unclear and fragmented, the report says, the children\u2019s convention is clear and unequivocal, taking into account minors\u2019 particular vulnerabilities. <br></p>"
