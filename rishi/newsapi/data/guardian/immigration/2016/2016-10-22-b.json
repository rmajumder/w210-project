  "<p>Just four years ago, Britain proudly projected the image of an open, tolerant, confident nation onto the international stage. We luxuriated in the glow of an Olympic opening ceremony that drew together the best of British: from Shakespeare to <em>EastEnders</em> the Queen to James Bond; the NHS to the internet.</p> <p>It featured Dizzee Rascal and Rowan Atkinson, Arctic Monkeys and the London Symphonic Orchestra. It was, according to writer Jonathan Freedland, \u201ca byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed.\u201d It was hailed abroad and Britain, it seemed, had shown itself to the world as a vibrant, open, confident, multicultural country.</p> <p>That all seems like a long time ago.</p> <p>Over the last few weeks, the image of a country celebrated by the genius of Danny Boyle is being replaced by one marked out by narrow minds and mean spirits. What has happened to us? The messages being sent across the world is that foreign students are not welcome and that British firms will have to list foreign workers. The loose language that started at the Conservative conference in Birmingham has consequences, domestically and internationally.</p> <p>It seems that some in politics and the press have misinterpreted the referendum result as a justification for an alarming shift in our political discourse. The referendum created a popular mandate for Britain to leave the European Union and demonstrated public appetite for a more controlled approach to immigration. It was not a mandate to descend into a brutish politics \u2013 and a brutish public discourse fanned by the lie factories of Fleet Street. The discourse is built on the assumption that we are a country with hostile views towards those who do not hail from these shores. That is not true.</p> <p>Politics has never felt meaner-spirited. We have seen the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/government-faces-backlash-from-business-leaders-over-foreign-workers\" title=\"\">home secretary announce plans </a>to force companies to disclose how many foreign workers they employ. MPs have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/home-office-rules-out-unethical-dental-checks-for-calais-refugees\" title=\"\">called for dental checks</a> to determine the age of refugees, even as the British Dental Association declared this inaccurate and unethical; and sections of the press <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/19/how-oldnet-no-real-indicator-of-age-says-microsoft-amid-child-refugee-row\" title=\"\">have been attacked by Microsoft</a> for using an inaccurate \u201cfun app\u201d to \u201cprove\u201d that child refugees are adults. The prime minister has reinforced the message that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/20/students-could-be-left-out-of-immigration-figures-ministers-hint\" title=\"\">international students are a drag</a>, not a boost, for Britain. And those who voted Remain and dare to scrutinise the government\u2019s position on Brexit are now deemed unpatriotic and undemocratic.</p> <p>It seems those politicians and commentators who flirted with xenophobia and bigotry in the referendum campaign have been emboldened. Theresa May\u2019s government has done nothing to challenge the tone of discourse. She once described the Tories as the \u201cnasty party\u201d \u2013 it would be shame if she is the prime minister who oversees the rise of the \u201cnasty country\u201d. But that is what is happening. As Seema Malhotra says on other pages today: \u201cThe post-Brexit debate is becoming less reasoned, more toxic and more intolerant. Language matters and political rhetoric has consequences.\u201d</p> <p>It is true that public concern about immigration has risen, particularly since the wave of European immigration after the EU expanded eastwards in 2004 and the financial crisis. But such concerns cannot be allowed to obscure the fact that Britain is, on the whole, a tolerant, diverse and successful society. There is a small segment of the population \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.britishfuture.org/articles/less-racist-anxious/\" title=\"\">the thinktank British Future</a> puts it at one in 10 \u2013 who endorse nakedly racist views. But racist attitudes have sharply declined over the last 30 years. The World Values Survey rates Britain as <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/world-values-survey-racial-tolerance-britain-468205\" title=\"\">one of the most racially tolerant countries</a> in the world.</p> <p>An analysis of public attitudes by the campaign group Hope Not Hate finds that <a href=\"http://www.fearandhope.org.uk/executive-summary/\" title=\"\">England is a more tolerant</a> and confident multicultural society in 2016 than in 2011. The proportion of the English population broadly positive about immigration has risen to 38%; and the proportion most hostile to immigration \u2013 whose attitudes are driven by opposition to ethnicities and religions other than their own \u2013 has <a href=\"http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/features/fear-and-hope-3\" title=\"\">shrunk from 13% to 7%</a>. The biggest chunk \u2013 42% \u2013 are concerned about the economic impact of further immigration or have concerns about its impact on cultural identity.</p> <p>The majority position in England can be characterised as tough, but pragmatic: 60% favour only allowing in migrants who help the economy. This is reflected in the lack of public support for government policy to reduce the number of international students: one poll suggests 87% of the British public would like to see the same number, or more, international students when they are <a href=\"http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/news/Pages/New-poll-%E2%80%93-cutting-international-student-numbers-will-not-address-public-immigration-concerns.aspx\" title=\"\">given information about the economic benefits</a>.</p> <p>No matter: the government seems determined that the rest of the world hear the message that Britain is no longer the country it used to be. The world has started to notice. <em>The Times of India</em> has <a href=\"http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-editorials/island-mentality-uk-is-flirting-with-protectionist-walls-india-can-counter-by-pushing-reforms/\" title=\"\">condemned the government\u2019s approach</a>, declaring: \u201cOther countries like Canada and Australia are much more welcoming.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/young-irish-think-twice-about-living-in-britain-after-brexit\" title=\"\">The Irish ambassador</a> has made similar noises. The irony is that we need to be projecting precisely the opposite image to make a success of Brexit. We need friends and cordial relations with as much of the international community as possible.</p> <p>Irresponsible political discourse shapes whose voices get projected and whose get silenced. It empowers the small minority who openly admit racist views, like the far-right protesters who jeered Tracy Brabin, the newly elected MP for Batley and Spen, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/labour-tracy-brabin-batley-and-spen-byelection-witney-robert-court\" title=\"\">as she paid tribute to Jo Cox</a>. Meanwhile, the tabloid vilification of public figures, such as Gary Lineker, who bravely challenge hateful tones in the debate has a chilling effect on the voice of the decent majority. For the <em>Sun</em> to challenge Lineker\u2019s \u201clies\u201d about child migrants on the day that their reporter Mazher Mahmood is sent to jail as a result of the fallout from a story in the <em>Sun on Sunday</em> in 2013, is beyond parody.</p> <p>The referendum resulted in a popular mandate that cannot be ignored. This cannot mean dismissing public concerns about immigration or continuing to argue that Britain should remain a member of the EU. But neither does it mean being swept along by a dangerous politics of hate most Britons reject out of hand.</p> <p>Britain needs a government prepared to lead a responsible and honest public conversation on immigration and integration, while challenging the racism and bigotry of a small minority. Instead, by assuming the 52% who voted Leave will embrace her government\u2019s policies on foreign students and child refugees, Mrs May is committing the same sin she has been quick to attribute to the liberal elite: patronising and belittling voters concerned about immigration. In doing so, she betrays her misunderstanding of who we are as a country.</p>",
  "<p>Britain is supporting an overseas battle against drugs that critics say is leading to the arrest and potential execution of people either duped or coerced into becoming \u201cmules\u201d.</p> <p>The issue is a sensitive one for the prime minister. Theresa May has made combating people trafficking a priority for her government. But human rights groups say the UK is failing to recognise the consequences of its support for a number of operations abroad that target people being trafficked to smuggle drugs.</p> <p>Britain has been funding and training Pakistani drug enforcement officers to intercept drugs at ports and airports through a UN initiative called the <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/ropan/en/BorderControl/container-control/ccp.html\" title=\"\">Container Control Programme</a>. Documents dated 17 October show that the UK has given almost $200,000 (\u00a3163,000) to the programme.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/06/iran-pakistan-executions-saudi-arabia-amnesty\">Iran and Pakistan fuel surge in executions to 25-year high</a> </p> </aside>  <p>UK officials are also mentoring and training Pakistan customs agents, the Home Office confirmed. Last month, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime revealed that the programme had led to the seizure of drugs at Karachi airport that were bound for Saudi Arabia. Three men arrested in connection with the seizures now face potential death penalties, according to the human rights group Reprieve.</p> <p>There is evidence that some of those caught attempting to smuggle drugs from Pakistan are doing so under duress \u2013 to pay off family debt or because a relative is being held by a criminal gang. In other cases, those smuggling the drugs are poorly educated and unaware of the implications.</p> <p>The UN special rapporteur on migrant workers is one of several experts who have raised concerns that some smugglers sentenced to death in Saudi Arabia are trafficking victims. Almost four-fifths of those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/02/saudi-arabia-beheadings-reach-highest-level-in-two-decades\" title=\"\">on death row in the kingdom</a> are foreign nationals, most of them migrant workers from India or Pakistan. There are about 8,000 people on Pakistan\u2019s death row, many of them being held for drugs offences. Since the country lifted the moratorium on the death penalty more than 400 people have been executed.</p> <p>In a letter to home secretary Amber Rudd, Maya Foa, director of Reprieve, warns that the \u201cUK funding for counter-narcotics programmes may be not only contributing to the death penalty and other human rights abuse, but even leading to the arrest and execution of some of the very exploited people it is seeking to protect.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office denies funding the programme and insists all of its overseas engagement work is risk-assessed, which includes looking at any impact on human rights.</p>",
  "<p>Your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/15/social-care-elderly-inadequate-funding\" title=\"\">view on social care</a> (Editorial) rightly highlights a vital public service on its knees following years of funding cuts. This neglect of our social-care system is having a dire effect on the lives of thousands, if not millions, of disabled and older people who deserve decent, dignified and compassionate support to live fulfilling and independent lives.</p> <p>We know that funding cuts mean at least 400,000 fewer people are now receiving social care compared to 2009. In addition to the devastating impact on individuals, this is placing the NHS under further unsustainable pressure.</p> <p>The government must take urgent action on this issue. With the autumn statement fast approaching, the chancellor has an opportunity to bring forward vital additional funding to help stabilise a system facing crisis.</p> <p>In the longer term, we need an honest national conversation, led by a cross-party commission, about which aspects of support the state can and should fund and what people should be individually responsible for. Only then will we create a social-care system that is sustainable and of which we can all be proud.<br><strong>Neil Heslop</strong><br>Chief executive<br>Leonard Cheshire Disability, London SW8</p> <h2><strong>The will of the people?</strong><br></h2> <p>The hypocrisy of Brexit politicians never ceases to amaze. As you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/15/new-alliances-oppose-hard-brexit\" title=\"\">reported</a> (In Focus), at Westminster they demand that parliament, in which they have no majority, should not have a voice in the Leave negotiations. They argue that Brexit is the inviolable will of the people, despite being that of less than half of the electorate and only a small majority of those who actually voted. The reverse is the case in Northern Ireland. There, they have used the built-in Unionist majority in Stormont to thwart the democratically expressed wish of their electorate to remain, which could be recognised by negotiating special EU status for Northern Ireland. Consistency is certainly not their strong point.<br><strong>Stephen Butcher</strong><br>Ballymena<br>County Antrim</p> <h2><strong>Brexit dunces</strong><br></h2> <p>With regard to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/16/university-funding-brexit-eu-freedom-of-movement\" title=\"\">David Willetts\u2019s piece</a> (\u201cOur universities and research centres are thriving: Brexit threatens them\u201d, Comment), as we have pointed out, EU students could be offered temporary residency status and access to loans with the proviso that reciprocal arrangements are agreed for UK students wishing to study in Europe.</p> <p>Classifying EU students as international students will damage a market that enhances the UK culturally and economically. Government plans to apply a two-tier visa system to international students, according to the \u201cquality\u201d of the university at which they study, are already having an adverse impact on the UK\u2019s global reputation for high-quality education.</p> <p>Foisted upon the Home Office by Number 10, these proposals completely miss the point. All UK universities are quality assured, so quality is not in doubt. Facing both ways is never a good position for any government. In advance of her visit to India, Theresa May should allow the home secretary, Amber Rudd, to do the right thing and withdraw these proposals for international students They are based on misconceived and outdated prejudices and are little more than a backdoor attempt to use international students to reduce migration numbers.<br><strong>Pam Tatlow</strong><br>Chief executive<br>MillionPlus, The Association for Modern Universities<br>London<br></p> <h2><strong>Let\u2019s have a no-fly zone</strong><br></h2> <p>Your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/16/heathrow-gatwick-expansion-commission-decision\" title=\"\">business leader article on Gatwick v Heathrow</a> was wrong to take it as read that we need to expand airport capacity (\u201cGatwick\u2019s the best choice in many ways, but a Heathrow Hub fudge could sweeten the deal\u201d, Business). If we are serious about trying to cut greenhouse gas emissions, we cannot afford more air travel. Therefore, a much better option than increasing supply is to reduce demand, by raising airport duty. A sharp increase in the tax would greatly reduce the number of flights taken for trivial purposes, leaving plenty of air travel capacity for the business users who are lobbying for expansion.</p> <p>The money raised from the more expensive flights would ideally be used to cancel some of the austerity public spending cuts, but if the government wanted a more populist approach, they could share it out as a direct payment to every adult in the UK as an annual \u201cclimate change bonus\u201d.<br><strong>Richard Mountford</strong><br>Tonbridge, Kent</p> <h2><strong>Hooray for the tax activists</strong><br></h2> <p>Luke Harding charts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/16/taxes-panama-papers-trump-tax-havens\" title=\"\">the gradual exposure of tax havens</a> and their users (\u201cOnly idiots still pay tax\u201d, News) but predictably forgets to mention one group.

  "<p>Newly arrived child refugees from Calais are being forced to live in a controversial former detention centre because the Home Office refused to enact a resettlement strategy to safely house unaccompanied minors.</p> <p>Despite months of warnings from the French authorities that the Calais camp would close, the <em>Observer</em> has learnt that the Home Office elected not to act on a plan designed and agreed by local councils to ensure vulnerable child refugees were adequately housed when they came to Britain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/are-you-affected-by-the-events-at-the-calais-camp\">Are you affected by the events at the Calais camp?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dismantling the vast camp in France will begin on Monday, although its large population of unaccompanied minors will be kept on site, raising hopes that the UK government may be willing to significantly increase the number of child refugees it will allow into Britain.</p> <p>And there are indications that the UK may be on the verge of bringing in the first refugees from Calais under the so-called Dubs amendment \u2013 the government promise to help unaccompanied minors announced in May.</p> <p>So far only child refugees with relatives in the UK have been allowed to enter, but on Saturday sources in the camp said a group of teenage Eritrean girls were on the brink of being taken to Britain under the amendment \u2013 a development that could pave the way for hundreds of other youngsters.</p> <p>The development came almost at the same time as the charity Help Refugees said the high court had fast-tracked its legal action over home secretary Amber Rudd\u2019s failure to implement the Dubs amendment. Rosa Curling, a lawyer at Leigh Day, said: \u201cWe are saying that the Dubs amendment is an important new duty and it must be implemented urgently.\u201d</p> <p>Josie Naughton of Help Refugees said \u2018 We really welcome the fact that, after bringing our legal challenge, we are seeing some movement at last on registering the Dubs Amendment children in Calais.\u201dLast week more than 60 unaccompanied minors arrived in London from Calais to cheers from wellwishers but a hostile response from some politicians and newspapers. Leaked emails sent from Home Office officials last week exposed panic inside the department because officials had not properly prepared for them: civil servants sent pleas for \u201curgent help\u201d to residential care services, stressing the issue was \u201ctime critical due to the need to bring the children here prior to the camp being dismantled\u201d.</p> <p>The failure to prepare adequately means some child refugees have been forced to stay at a \u201cpre-departure\u201d immigration detention unit called Cedars, near Gatwick airport. Cedars was shut by the government in July following criticism over the policy of imprisoning children and family awaiting removal from the country.</p> <p>Another negative side-effect of the Home Office\u2019s approach has meant that, despite all the Calais child refugees allowed into Britain having relatives in the UK, only a few have been settled with family members. Instead, a number of younger unaccompanied minors have been placed in foster care because the required background checks on family members have not been conducted.</p> <p>A source close to the process said: \u201cPolitically, the Home Office did not want this to happen, so it didn\u2019t do anything. Therefore as the camp comes to closure it\u2019s a panic \u2013 all the work you should have done over three to six months you do over three to six hours. They cannot place the child in a number of cases because none of the checks have been done.\u201d</p> <p>Andy Elvin, chief executive of Tact, the UK\u2019s largest fostering and adoption charity with more than 500 carers, said: \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing for a developed nation not to have managed this more professionally. We\u2019re not even talking about a massive number of children.\u201d</p> <p>The plan was drawn up six months ago and agreed two months ago by the Local Government Association and adoption services, although discussions go back as far as September 2015. A document entitled \u201cProcessing unaccompanied minors\u201d was drawn up following the meeting in which the need is stressed for a comprehensive database of eligible minors to be created.</p> <p>Buses will began taking the camp\u2019s residents to reception centres across France from Monday morning. However, charities warn that the arrival of French riot police might also prompt a mass exodus from the camp. During a partial clearance of the camp in March, 129 children went missing.</p> <p>The French interior ministry has warned that police officers \u201cmight be forced to intervene\u201d if faced with resistance \u2013 a threat that has raised the potential for violent clashes between the authorities and refugees who do not want to abandon their dream of reaching the UK.</p> <p>However, officials have said they will not invade the site with bulldozing equipment during the initial phase of clearing the camp.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Home Office said it would not comment on the specifics of resettlement programmes.</p>",
  "<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/21/offer-cash-rewards-to-underachievers-to-boost-gcse-results-study-says\" title=\"\">study</a> financed by the Education Endowment Foundation, the University of Bristol assessed the performance of 10,600 students approaching GCSEs in disadvantaged areas to see what effect financial incentives (worth up to \u00a380 per half-term) or non-financial enticements (such as vouchers for gig tickets) would have on behaviour, schoolwork, homework and attendance.</p> <p>While incentives had little effect on strong pupils, underperformers improved exam grades and pass marks by up to 10%. The intervention had particularly substantial effects on science and maths GCSE results for up to half of those involved, closing 50% of the attainment gap between pupils eligible for free school meals and other students.</p> <p>Cash proved most effective, while non-financial incentives weren\u2019t far behind. Professor Simon Burgess, heading the study, said that this was the first comparison of financial/non-financial rewards over an entire academic year in the run-up to GSCEs and could help low-income pupils in a relatively cost-effective way.</p> <p>All of which sounds very interesting. At the same time, all this talk of \u201cincentivising\u201d sounds eerily familiar \u2013 haven\u2019t certain households always brazenly \u201cincentivised\u201d their children, especially in the run-up to exams?</p> <p>It bears emphasising that the University of Bristol study did <em>not</em> offer rewards for exam results. Could you imagine the uproar if it did? (\u201cChildren offered hard cash to pass exams!\u201d), a reaction that in certain quarters would be hilariously hypocritical. In truth, particularly in comfortable households, a barefaced culture of \u201ccash for results\u201d has been operating, unofficially and domestically, for some time.</p> <p>Nor does it stop with GCSEs \u2013 it goes on to A-levels, university places, degrees. Indeed, there\u2019s nothing new or shocking about a certain breed of better-off student being offered incentives \u2013 in the form of cash (usually per result), gigs/ festivals, even, it\u2019s rumoured, cars or holidays, to pass important exams or, more commonly, get better grades.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve dabbled myself in the dark arts of \u201cincentivising\u201d, though only half-heartedly, and I\u2019d do it again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nor does there seem to be much anguished soul-searching about it. Maybe the more ethical parents refuse to do it, or at least feel guilty about doing it, but it\u2019s mainly a bizarre mix of practicality and gamesmanship. A case of: does bribing children work? (Hope so). And is such bribery pathetic, conniving, verging on immoral? (Who cares?)</p> <p>Of course, there are higher moral planes here, not least that education should be viewed as a reward unto itself. Against that, there are the realities of safely steering a child through certain key education stages, which, from the parental point of view, could be likened to a huge ongoing egg-and-spoon race, where the egg\u2019s already fallen off and splattered, the spoon\u2019s been stolen and someone\u2019s set fire to your hair.</p> <p>With this in mind, a little sweetening of the deal starts looking not so much unethical as unavoidable. I\u2019m not judging anyone; I\u2019ve dabbled myself in the dark arts of \u201cincentivising\u201d, though only half-heartedly compared to some, and I\u2019d do it again. I\u2019m well aware that this is a staunch middle-class educational mindset: the refusal to allow your child to fail, coupled with enough resources to throw into areas such as incentivising. This could be beyond the reach of disadvantaged families, who care about their kids just as much.</p> <p>While strong candidates do well regardless, there\u2019s something to be said for addressing this unofficial socioeconomic disadvantage facing underperforming low-income children with official intervention to incentivise them. In effect, the state would merely be replicating what routinely happens in many middle-class households across the land. This is basically, if all else fails, bribe your kids and bribe \u2019em good. The main difference is that \u2013 let\u2019s face it \u2013 the average middle-class kid probably wouldn\u2019t be motivated by a mere \u00a380 a half-term.</p> <h2>Lineker scored for the refugees without a voice<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6768dd8b21a3a963683348c9a138f9482c23ee5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6768dd8b21a3a963683348c9a138f9482c23ee5/0_158_5232_3139/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Lineker: speaking up for \u2018basic humanity\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Lineker: speaking up for \u2018basic humanity\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rii Schroer/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bravo, Gary Lineker.

  "<p>Halfway though the concert, Daniel Melingo dramatically removes his left shoe to extract an imaginary pebble mentioned in the lyric he is singing. The shoe stays off for the rest of the night, much of which Melingo spends on his belly \u201cswimming\u201d across the stage, arms flapping loosely like a drunkard, as his breathy basso voice infuses the hall with that heady mix of disillusionment, longing and betrayal that is the hallmark of Argentina\u2019s soul-searing tango music.</p> <p>It has been said that listening to Melingo is like watching a Federico Fellini movie with your eyes closed. The circus elements beloved by the Italian film-maker are all present \u2013 the barrel-house music, the burlesque comedy, the soppy southern European sentimentalism.</p> <p>Then there is the persona Melingo has invented for himself, a black-clad, rumpled-up, Chaplinesque vagabond that the singer has used to make tango cool again for a new generation of Argentinians raised on rap, hip-hop and the South American tropical <em>cumbia</em> rhythm.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s side of the family were tango people,\u201d says Melingo, sitting down to talk at a cafe in the tree-lined neighbourhood of Villa Ort\u00fazar where he lives, only a couple of days after his barefoot antics while performing <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Ip71b3Jajvg\" title=\"\">his new album <em>Anda</em></a> at a vaudeville theatre in downtown Buenos Aires. \u201cBut on my father\u2019s side my grandmother sang opera. One of my first musical memories is listening to Ravel\u2019s Pavane for a Dead Infanta on the radio with my grandfather holding me in his arms.\u201d</p> <p>His expressive eyes darting animatedly beneath bushy, grey eyebrows, Melingo lists off the stops on his European tour next month \u2013 Cologne, Lisbon, Paris, Antwerp, Zurich, among others, including a <a href=\"http://thejazzcafelondon.com/event/como-no-presents-melingo-02-11-16\" title=\"\">gig at London\u2019s Jazz Cafe</a>.</p> <p>Often compared to Tom Waits or Nick Cave because of his below-the-floorboards vocal register, Melingo did not initially set out to lure young people back into Argentina\u2019s tango halls to retrace the complicated, embroidery-like steps their grandparents once cut when the tango was still young. But there has been a surge of interest both at home and abroad, partly due to Melingo and partly to fusion projects such as Bajofondo and the Gotan Project, which combine tango sounds with modern urban electronic beats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9553e21f919102df446fdf1ab1de7facbae6ca07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9553e21f919102df446fdf1ab1de7facbae6ca07/0_250_5378_3227/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People dance the tango at a Milonga in downtown Buenos Aires.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People dance the tango at a Milonga in downtown Buenos Aires.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His career began as a rock\u2019n\u2019roll star in two of Argentina\u2019s biggest 1980s bands, Los Twist and Los Abuelos de la Nada, who shot to fame with the exhilarating cultural liberation after the collapse of the country\u2019s 1976-83 dictatorship, under which some 30,000 people, most of them young, had been \u201cdisappeared\u201d in military death camps.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very hard to be young in that ferocious era,\u201d says Melingo, 59. \u201cWe survived like cockroaches, indoors, creating antibodies out of aesthetic ideas.\u201d Artistic expression was heavily curtailed under a regime that not only killed young people for their political beliefs but also censored their artistic expression and persecuted them for the length of their hair, dragging them by the bus-load into police stations to have it shorn off.</p> <p>Many artists escaped abroad, others went into internal exile, putting their careers on hold until the return of democracy. \u201cWe became masters at writing in-between the lines, describing poetically and metaphorically what was actually happening.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Tango in Argentina is like ice to an eskimo, you don't notice it even though it's all around you</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Melingo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A classically trained musician who, aside from singing, plays the clarinet, Melingo was never far from the limelight after that initial post-dictatorship boost. Yet it wasn\u2019t until 1997, when he turned 40, that the memories of his tango-dancing mother led Melingo to turn his talents instead to the music that some define as Argentina\u2019s equivalent of the blues.</p> <p>After a brief stint hosting a television show where he invited rock\u2019n\u2019roll buddies to play old tango tunes, Melingo made an abrupt career change. \u201cI had to relearn everything at the age of 40, study tango technique, take singing lessons.\u201d</p> <p>In the process his voice seemed to drop by octaves as he began to deliver songs almost in a whisper.</p> <p>His tango guide has been 79-year-old Luis Alposta, who wrote the words for classic songs by Edmundo Rivero during the 1970s. \u201cThe timbre and colour of Melingo\u2019s voice correspond to what is traditionally known as a tango voice,\u201d says Alposta of his younger friend. \u201cHe sings as if he was talking.\u201d</p> <p>The release of his first solo album in 1998, <em>Tangos Bajos</em>, catapulted Melingo into an international career that surpasses that of any other current Argentinian musical artist, especially in France, where he will be playing the <a href=\"http://www.bouffesdunord.com/fr/la-saison/melingo\" title=\"\">Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Bouffes du Nord</a>. Melingo has his own explanation for his success far from home: \u201cTango in Argentina is like ice for an Eskimo, you don\u2019t notice it even though it\u2019s all around you. But outside Argentina, people really sit up and listen.\u201d In a welcome surprise, Melingo\u2019s incessant touring brought him into contact with his ancestral musical roots when a Viennese woman, Daniela Melingo, sought him out at one of his concerts in Austria. She turned out to be his second cousin, descended from a brother of Melingo\u2019s Ravel-loving grandfather. \u201cShe told me our family came from the Greek island of Zakynthos, which had been the birthplace of <em>rebetiko</em>, an anarchic-illiterate musical movement to which my grandfather belonged,\u201d Melingo says.</p> <p>The influence is clearly noticeable. At the concert in Buenos Aires the musical mood subtly shifted from tango to <em>rebetiko</em>, from Buenos Aires to Zakynthos, Constantinople and Asia Minor, with Melingo the restless vagabond, those flashing eyes now invisible under the tilted brim of his black hat, proudly strumming his grandfather\u2019s tiny <em>ba\u011flama</em> (a Turkish lute) as he meandered up to the microphone to sing.</p>",
  "<p>When Laila learnt Islamic State was holding her son in an old school less than 100 miles from the refugee camp she now calls home, she could start to dream of a rescue attempt. Then, when she heard troops were advancing on the group\u2019s last stronghold in Iraq, she even allowed herself to believe they might liberate her boy.</p> <p>Days later the advance has slowed, there has been no mention of Yazidi captives by soldiers or politicians, and her despair has returned. \u201cHope is crushed,\u201d she said. \u201cEver since we lost our kids, no one has done anything, planned anything to rescue them.\u201d</p> <p>She has no idea where her son is now, and is haunted by fears that he could be forced to die fighting for his captors or in an air strike, or be transported to Syria for new torments.</p> <p>While the fight for Mosul is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/22/attack-on-kirkuk-toxic-chemical-sulphur-fire-isis-pushes-troops-from-mosul-frontline\">key step towards dismantling Isis\u2019s self-declared caliphate</a>, for a group that has endured some of its most extreme brutality and violence, it only poses new dangers. Relatives say the liberating forces have forgotten hundreds of Yazidi women and children held by Isis as slaves in Mosul and are calling for attacking forces to add rescue missions \u2013 or at least details of where captives are held \u2013 to their battle plan. \u201cWe know there are more than 1,000 Yazidi captives \u2013 women, girls and boys \u2013 in Mosul,\u201d said Ameena Saeed Hasan, a Yazidi activist recently awarded the 2016 Human Rights First award for her work running a rescue network.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough the operation to liberate Mosul started a few days ago, unfortunately there is no plan to rescue these captives: no one even asks the Yazidis where they are. It seems no one cares about these things, they just want to take control of the city.\u201d</p> <p>Many families, like Laila\u2019s, have some idea where their captured relatives are held from reports via others who have been freed, smuggled details from local sympathisers or calls on stolen mobile phones. But the coalition of Iraqi forces, peshmerga fighters, Sunni and Shia militias and their foreign backers now marching on Mosul have ignored pleas to include rescue missions in their plans or even collect details of where captives may be.</p> <p>\u201cWe usually cry when we watch the news,\u201d said Kurte, 64, who lost three sons to Isis and asked not to be named in full because a teenage relative is still missing. She feared any criticism of Isis that the group stumbled across online might be used as an excuse to add to the girl\u2019s torment. \u201cEveryone is talking about the operation in Mosul,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are afraid Isis might use our girls as shields to defend themselves, that the army might shoot the boys if they mistake them for Isis.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30a4bd3ac37a5e0c4ef7ead8b5c295cee88354d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30a4bd3ac37a5e0c4ef7ead8b5c295cee88354d1/0_111_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunni fighters ride a motorcycle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunni fighters ride a motorcycle down a road east of Mosul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ahmad Al-Rubaye/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the jihadi group swept into Yazidi villages in the foothills of the Sinjar mountain in August 2014, murdering hundreds of men and taking women and children as slaves, 2,725 have escaped or been smuggled to freedom.

The militants had already transported them to another place,\u201d says Husain Qaide, head of the government\u2019s official bureau for the rescue of Isis captives in Dohuk city, adding that Mosul and Tel Afar were two key centres for Isis\u2019s disturbing slave trade.</p> <p>He has appealed to the troops fighting around the city to block routes where they can to prevent women being moved to Syria at the end of a battle widely expected to be difficult and protracted, but to end in Isis\u2019s defeat. There have been promises of help from peshmerga, though no action so far, and other forces have not bothered to respond.</p> <p>Mosul residents confirm that enslaved Yazidis are still inside the city, where conditions for civilians are rapidly deteriorating. Some Isis fighters have already retreated to Syria, and those that remain are increasingly jumpy. \u201cThere are three Yazidi girls in our neighbourhood, in Kurdish Daesh houses,\u201d said Abu Ali, a 24-year-old local using the Arabic name for Isis.

The north Nineveh plains around Mosul were famously one of the most diverse places in the region, even if the city itself was dominated by Sunni Muslims.</p> <p>One of the big questions hanging over the operation to rout Isis is whether that reputation for coexistence can be reclaimed after two years of sectarian violence and poisonous propaganda. Many minority communities now say they fear returning without protection.</p> <p>They say Isis could not have conquered or ruled without local collaborators, who may still try to kill and harass. And a recent attack on the city of Kirkuk, more than 60 miles from Mosul and meant to be firmly under government control, was a reminder of Isis\u2019s ability to spread death and destruction far from areas they control.</p> <p>This week church bells rang out over the liberated town of Bartella for the first time in two years, and there was excitement that the famous arak drinks of nearby Bashiqa, another Christian centre, would be back in production. Still missing, though, are the worshippers and drinkers who once enjoyed them. Father Bools Mate Afram, head of the Orthodox Church in Bashiqa before Isis arrived said he would definitely return, but fears that many of his parishioners have set up new lives elsewhere, or are wary about security.</p> <p>\u201cI know many families who want to go back but they need international protection to be able to live in Nineveh plains again,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He fears Mosul\u2019s community \u2013 almost as old as Christianity itself \u2013 is likely to be decimated because of worries that the violent ideology of Isis will live on. \u201cMany Christians say that under no conditions will they return to Mosul city itself because the chances that it will be a secure and safe city, even after Daesh is gone, are very weak,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Yazidis, too, worry about moving back, even if Isis fighters and bombs can be cleared from their old homes. \u201cSinjar [in Nineveh province] was safe, but then everything was destroyed, and now we are afraid to go back,\u201d said Kurte, who lost her health and her confidence along with her sons.</p> <p>\u201cWe saw videos of our girls.

  "<p>Lewis Hamilton sizzled like a Texas barbecue, searing around the Circuit of the Americas to produce the fastest lap ever seen here. It placed him on pole position \u2013 his 58th \u2013 for Sunday\u2019s United States Grand Prix, and with three wins from four in Austin his damaged confidence has received a transfusion.</p> <p>Without a win since July and troubled by engine failures and bad starts, Hamilton appears to be on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/10/mercedes-lewis-hamilton-world-championship-f1\" title=\"\">the very brink of losing his world championship</a>. But the Mercedes driver is immensely strong in adversity and here, cheered on by the tennis star Venus Williams, he produced one of those thrilling, hooked-together laps that has earned him his reputation as one of Formula One\u2019s fastest drivers.</p> <p>He loves it here, the track\u2019s darting dips and giddy climbs, its sweeping curves and considerable technical challenges. This Hermann Tilke-designed circuit acts like a tribute to other tracks, with some of its challenges modelled on famous parts of other venues, such as Silverstone and Istanbul. And Hamilton appears to understand its mixed personality better than any other driver.</p> <p>Nico Rosberg, his team-mate and rival, will join Hamilton on the front row. He was no slouch either, but was still beaten by two-tenths of a second, with the Red Bulls of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen behind them on the grid.</p> <p>Last year we had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/23/heavy-rain-cancellation-f1-practice-us-grand-prix\" title=\"\">a washout of a weekend</a> here but now a hot sun shone on Hamilton as he went almost three-tenths faster than Rosberg in the complicated first sector. But just before his winning lap the British driver appeared to be threatened by yet another technical glitch, when he reported: \u201cWeird shift up to seven.\u201d Mercedes replied: \u201cOK, we\u2019re looking.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton said later: \u201cI feel amazing. It is my first pole here. It has been many years of trying. A lot of great people have tried to get me there. Big thanks to the crowd; I could hear them cheer as I crossed the line.</p> <p>\u201cI hope tomorrow I will provide them with great race. I\u2019m going to give it everything I\u2019ve got. Now I just have to put thoughts to action. Tomorrow I need to have a real big one.\u201d</p> <p>The track, he said, was a difficult one to get right but even in Q1 he looked in his sharpest form. \u201cWe have worked hard over the last couple of weeks \u2013 understanding and improving a lot of areas \u2013 and it is a great feeling to be back up here.\u201d</p> <p>A resigned looking Rosberg said: \u201cThere was nothing specific. I preferred sector two and three today and Lewis was quicker in sector one, that was it. Nevertheless we have seen this year qualifying is not all important and I still have a great chance from P2.\u201d</p> <p>Of course Rosberg is right. Five bad starts have cost him dearly as Rosberg has built up a lead of 33 points in the world championship with just four races to go. Hamilton added: \u201cI have been practising the starts all weekend, so I feel positive about it.\u201d</p> <p>If he wins here, and is also victorious in Mexico, Brazil and Abu Dhabi, it may not be enough. But Hamilton sounded ready for the challenge when he said that the championship was still all to play for.</p> <p>Jenson Button, meanwhile, fell at the first hurdle, eliminated in Q1 after getting caught in traffic. \u201cI had four cars to overtake in the last sector and the last one saw me really late and was on the racing line, so I had to outbrake them into the last corner,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There was also local disappointment for Haas supporters. This is the American team\u2019s first home race, but Romain Grosjean immediately joined Button on the sidelines. There was better news for Britain\u2019s Jolyon Palmer, who is fighting to retain his seat at Renault. After strong performances in the previous two races he beat his team-mate Kevin Magnussen to move into Q2.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/20/lewis-hamilton-f1-title-nico-rosberg\">Lewis Hamilton ready to move on and come back stronger if he loses F1 title</a> </p> </aside>",

Not only has Trump confounded expectations all year, but like those campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union, he has closed within touching distance of his opponent several times already.</p> \n<p>Four weeks ago, on the morning of the first presidential debate, his position in key swing states was so strong that the statistician <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/\">Nate Silver</a> estimated his chances of overall victory at more than 45%. After the Republican convention in July, Silver briefly projected Trump would win.<br></p> \n<p>As in the case of Brexit, average poll numbers tilted back in favour of the status quo. The murder of MP Jo Cox was credited with shocking the British electorate back into a <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/sites/brexit-polling/\">two-point poll lead for Remain by the time of the referendum</a>. Outrage over a tape of Trump boasting about sexual assault precipitated his latest popularity slide and left Clinton with the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html\">near-six-point lead she now enjoys</a>.</p> \n<p>But Britons proved less ashamed of Brexit\u2019s dark reputation once they were inside the privacy of a polling booth, eventually <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-brexit-referendum/\">voting in favour of leaving by a nearly four-point margin</a>. What if US pollsters are missing shy Republicans? Or failing to account for Trump\u2019s ability to inspire people to turn out in greater numbers?</p> \n<p>It is certainly a complacency Democrats wish to avoid. Fortunately for them, this may be where the similarities with Brexit begin and end.</p> \n<h2><strong>Playing the system</strong></h2> \n<p>The biggest difference can be seen as a combination of America\u2019s voting system and its political tribes.</p> \n<p>A simple majority of the national popular vote was enough to rewrite Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe, but US presidents are required to win a majority of electoral college votes, which can be decisively achieved with a series of wins at the state level. In 1984, for example, Ronald Reagan secured 97.6% of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_by_Electoral_College_margin\">electoral college votes</a> with 58.8% of the popular vote, because Walter Mondale lost every state except Minnesota.</p> \n<p>Even if she defeats Trump in Republican strongholds like Texas, Utah, Arizona and Georgia, Clinton is unlikely to ever match Richard Nixon\u2019s landslide over George McGovern in 1972 or Lyndon Johnson\u2019s epic defeat of Barry Goldwater in 1964, for the simple reason that America has become more politically polarised in the years since.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a337725e0611f6cd2a72299d0010eb75d507487\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a337725e0611f6cd2a72299d0010eb75d507487/0_23_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman is moved to tears as Trump takes the stage at a campaign rally in Newtown, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman is moved to tears as Trump takes the stage at a campaign rally in Newtown, Pennsylvania.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But even a relatively small lead in the popular vote can translate into a decisive win, as Barack Obama found when he went into the 2012 election just 0.2% ahead of Mitt Romney in the polls yet emerged with a four-point majority in the popular vote and nearly two-thirds of the electoral college.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a0abf86a-cf7d-402f-a24a-7e2898260047\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"flat\"> \n    <h1>How will the election be decided? </h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>The president is chosen through the electoral college, in which each state is assigned a \n      <gu-note title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:21\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:21:30.549Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"80ca109a-7c23-445f-d54c-9ce6f6ccc7e6\" class=\"note note--start note--end\">\n       \u200bcertain \n      </gu-note>\u200bnumber of \n      <gu-note class=\"note note--start note--end\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:18:42.316Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"b36c395a-1920-42b2-b57b-faa721b9d586\" title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:18\">\n       \u200bvotes called \n      </gu-note>\u200belectoral votes&nbsp;(EVs)\n      <gu-note class=\"note note--start note--end\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:13:04.426Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"a3e31fdb-e028-4a34-e986-31a419d7747e\" title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:13\">\n       \u200b.

Anxious Republicans are urging voters to \u201csplit their ticket\u201d, to prevent Clinton accumulating too much power.

The white men who favour Trump may do so in part out of resentment that they no longer control the country so completely as they did, but the Democrats\u2019 far larger lead among female, African American, Asian and Latino voters is likely to only grow as the country diversifies. As each side adopts the insults of the other as a badge of pride, Clinton\u2019s \u201cnasty women\u201d and their allies simply outnumber Trump\u2019s \u201cdeplorables\u201d.</p> \n<p>Charts reveal other lines dividing the US in 2016. Educational attainment, often a proxy for class in a country that doesn\u2019t like to talk about it, is particularly indicative. College-educated voters flock to Clinton\u2019s message of optimism about the economy while those without degrees are among the biggest supporters of Trump\u2019s thesis that the system is rigged.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s comments about race and immigration have also polarised voters, driving non-whites back toward the Democratic coalition built by Obama but appearing to shock some white voters less.</p> \n<p>And, if it is about anything, this election is about gender. Although men overall may now lean narrowly toward Clinton after a month of Trump\u2019s misogynistic outbursts, it is striking that the average white American male is still pro-Republican.</p> \n<h2><strong>The unpopularity contest</strong></h2> \n<p>Of course, opinion pollsters can get demographics wrong too. Polls that listen to registered voters are better predictors of electoral outcomes than polls that listen to anyone who\u2019s willing to talk. But those polls still aren\u2019t perfect, partly because before voters actually vote, they\u2019re just people and people change their minds. Especially a long time before election day.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s why now, with just over two weeks to go until the US votes, the polls are far more accurate than they were months ago. A lot has happened over those months \u2013 two party conventions, three debates and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-tenth-woman-accuser\">10 allegations</a> of sexual assault against one candidate. After all the boosts and dips, the overall effect has been that Trump has fallen in popularity while Clinton has risen.</p> \n<p>Or, to be more specific, the polls show that Trump\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/trump_favorableunfavorable-5493.html\">unpopularity</a> has risen while Clinton\u2019s has <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/clinton_favorableunfavorable-1131.html\">fallen</a>. Both candidates are disliked by the majority of Americans.</p> \n<p>But it is not just Brexit and Romney that have given polling methodology a bad name. There has been a string of polling failures: the Israeli election, the Scottish independence referendum and the last UK general election. If anything, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2016/jan/27/dont-trust-the-polls-the-systemic-issues-that-make-voter-surveys-unreliable\">problems of polling</a> have got worse since those votes, partly because it is getting even harder to contact people who are willing to share their voting intention.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/22/democrats-texas-hillary-clinton-polls-donald-trump\">'It's surreal': is a Democratic uprising afoot deep in the heart of Texas?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Still, though polls will not perfectly predict the US election, state by state and down to the decimal point, they are likely to accurately guess who will win nationally, especially if Clinton has a large enough lead.</p> \n<p>The accuracy of polling in this election will hinge on the margin of error. Buried in the methodology of most polls is a note that says something along the lines of \u201cmargin of error: \u00b1 4%\u201d. It means if you repeated the poll 100 times with different respondents each time, the overall results would be within 4% of the results in at least 95 of those 100 polls.</p> \n<p>Right now, Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">polling average is 48% and Trump\u2019s is 42%</a>. If the margin of error on those numbers is \u00b14%, that means Clinton\u2019s support could be as low as 44% or as high as 52% with Trump\u2019s somewhere between 38% and 46%. The bigger the gap between the two candidates, the less the margin of error matters.</p> \n<p>The margin of error in this election could well be more than 4%, because polling has become less accurate. For Clinton supporters to really sit back and relax, the candidate needs to widen her lead to the extent that even if the polls are wrong on the numbers, they are still right about the result.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\" data-alt=\"Membership Drive\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\">Membership Drive</a> \n</figure>",

(It was not fully reopened until 1985, when Spain wanted to join the EU.)</p> <p>But this is not the only way in which Spain could make life difficult. Three years ago, during a particularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/04/gibraltar-comments-madrid-london-uk-spain\" title=\"\">bitter row over territorial waters</a>, Spanish authorities intensified border checks, creating traffic jams hours long at the crossing. Eventually the European commission had to step in.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the UK calls uncontrolled immigration, Gibraltar calls the essential flow of workers,\u201d Picardo said. So what we are working on now is how we can ensure our job market stays as open as it is now, for people who have the right, as EU nationals, to work in Gibraltar.\u201d</p> <p>Would Spain take that step? Picardo said he could not imagine that \u201cin the 21st century, a democratic Spanish government is seriously going to say, that if Gibraltar leaves the EU it will shut the gates\u201d. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has insisted Britain will maintain \u201can implacable, marmoreal and rock-like resistance\u201d to any change in Gibraltar\u2019s sovereignty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06285c538c9e50a78abf6ba6ea388165145445e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06285c538c9e50a78abf6ba6ea388165145445e0/0_34_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spanish foreign minister Jose  Garcia-Margallo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Garcia-Margallo ays Gibraltar\u2019s access to the EU will come only via shared sovereignty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Nazca/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Madrid may have other ideas. Johnson\u2019s equally bombastic counterpart, Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Margallo, who earlier this month threatened to \u201cplant his flag\u201d on the enclave, has repeatedly said Gibraltar\u2019s only post-Brexit access to the single market will come through shared sovereignty. Spain, he also likes to recall, can veto any trade deal between the UK and the EU. The prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/mariano-rajoy-if-uk-leaves-eu-so-does-gibraltar-brexit-theresa-may-single-market/\" title=\"\">reportedly told May in Madrid last week</a> that once the UK abandons free movement and the single market, Gibraltar will have to do so too \u2013 unless it agrees to joint rule.</p> <p>The nightmare, many here agree, would be if, some years down the line, Madrid were to force London to choose between Gibraltar\u2019s sovereignty and \u2013 for example \u2013 enhanced access for UK firms to the EU single market.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the $64,000 question,\u201d said Marcus Killick of leading Gibraltar law firm Isolas. \u201cIf there\u2019s a deal that\u2019s pivotal to the City of London and requires Spanish support, how far will the UK government go to defend Gibraltar? How deep is that loyalty, really?\u201d</p> <p>For the time being, such concerns seem some way off. \u201cThings are going to get tough,\u201d said Edward Macquisten of the Gibraltar chamber of commerce, in his office above the main Casemates Square. \u201cBut look, this is a small, agile, adaptable jurisdiction: we can change direction fast. The people here are not unused to uncertainty \u2013 we\u2019ve been living with it for 300 years. If one market closes, we\u2019ll find others.\u201d</p> <p>Killick, who has set up a Brexit support unit for his clients, was similarly optimistic: \u201cA shock followed by a reinvention can be a powerful thing. When the meteorite hit the earth, it was the dinosaurs that died out, not the mice.\u201d</p> <p>So businesses based on the Rock are urgently exploring alternatives. The online gaming industry will not be hit: it has never benefited from a single market as the EU requires companies to negotiate national licences. Others, though, may now switch their focus back to the UK \u2013 in effect reinventing themselves as entry points for European firms keen to access the post-Brexit UK market via Gibraltar\u2019s attractive tax and regulatory regime and lower start-up costs. That will require new laws in Gibraltar and Britain, but looks as though it can be done.</p> <p>A second option could be to move some operations to another EU state. Steve Quinn, who founded Quest, now Gibraltar\u2019s largest insurance management firm, said his clients who operate mainly in the UK market \u201cwill probably not be affected even by a hard Brexit, as long as bilateral trade is formalised\u201d. But those selling into the EU will be looking for solutions. \u201cSome are already talking to authorities in places like Malta, Dublin, Luxembourg, the Baltic states: places that are tax-benign and in the EU.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Cowan, managing director of the fast-growing Gibraltar Stock Exchange, which has helped borrowers raise \u20ac400m of investment capital so far this year, said its business model had been \u201cbuilt on passporting \u2013 being able to sell, say, a UK carpet manufacturer\u2019s bonds into every country across the EEA\u201d.</p> <p>Brexit would force the GSX to reconfigure, Cowan said, possibly by opening a subsidiary in another EU state \u2013 he\u2019s already sounded out Malta \u2013 and almost certainly by passporting into the UK.</p> <p>\u201cPost-Brexit,\u201d Cowan said, \u201cif you\u2019re a German corporate wanting to market to the UK, you\u2019ll have to either seek approval from the FCA in London \u2013 or come to us. As a jurisdiction, Gibraltar is likely to be faster, more user-friendly and more competitive on price. We sit down the corridor from the regulator. Issues can be resolved fast.\u201d</p> <p>Many here believe there is broad support for Gibraltar\u2019s cause in Brussels and other EU capitals \u2013 and mounting frustration with Spain for seeking to profit from Brexit. Macquisten said: \u201cGibraltar is almost a model of what the EU set out to achieve: cross-border cooperation, jobs for EU citizens, economic growth, full compliance \u2026 Surely the EU won\u2019t want that to end, Gibraltar to be punished? Especially when we showed our commitment to the EU ideal so overwhelmingly last June?\u201d</p> <p>But it may not be down to Gibraltar, or to London. \u201cSpain,\u201d <a href=\"http://en.mercopress.com/2016/10/19/spain-anticipates-closed-frontier-if-gibraltar-does-not-accept-joint-sovereignty\" title=\"\">Garc\u00eda-Margallo reiterated last week</a>, \u201cwill never give up its claim\u201d to the Rock \u2013 and free movement across the border would \u201cautomatically end\u201d unless Gibraltarians accepted shared sovereignty.</p> <h2>The meaning of leaving: on life, visas and health</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dddc7ef2056cc1550d1f4086c678b56a1df4a82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dddc7ef2056cc1550d1f4086c678b56a1df4a82/0_147_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"British expats in Benalmadena, Spain:\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British expats in Benalmadena, Spain: no one yet knows yet quite how daily life there will be affected.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Ramos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brexit could affect the residence rights of the 1.2 million British citizens who live in other EU countries, as well as their ability to work visa-free and access free healthcare \u2013 but no one yet knows how.</p> <p>With article 50 yet to be triggered and the UK government refusing to reveal its hand, all that can be said with certainty is that issue will form a important part of the negotiations due to begin before April next year.</p> <p>Lawyers say it\u2019s unlikely anyone already living abroad will be kicked out, particularly if they\u2019ve lived there legally for five years (the point at which they can become long-term residents, a status granted to non-EU citizens, which British nationals will be). Whatever is agreed will mostly be reciprocal, so if Britain requires residence permits, proof of income and work visas for new EU migrants, this will almost certainly apply to British citizens moving to the EU.</p> <p>Inheritance and tax laws may change, although existing property rights and UK pensions \u2013 which are paid anywhere in the world \u2013 are unlikely to be affected. But British workers may be hit by rules in more than half of EU states that say a non-EU citizen can be hired only if no EU candidate is found.</p> <p>The Spanish government, for example, has already suggested that after Brexit, the UK will have to pay the healthcare costs of Brits living in Spain.

In the second debate, for instance, Trump mentioned Isis six times in response to a question from Anderson Cooper on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">Access Hollywood tape in which Trump said he would grab a woman\u2019s genitals without her consent</a>.</p> <p>Clinton avoided tough questions about her use of a private email server or the content of numerous emails from her inner circle released by WikiLeaks by highlighting Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia. Clinton mentioned Putin or Russia seven times in one response in the third debate when asked by Chris Wallace about a speech she gave to a Brazilian bank that was released by WikiLeaks. </p> <p>The economy consistently ranks among the most important topics for voters, often followed closely by national security and terrorism. In this respect, the candidates\u2019 focus on the debates was closely aligned with public interest. </p> <p>However, the supreme court is one of the most divisive issues, especially for conservatives voters conflicted on whether to vote for Trump, and it only featured prominently once in the third debate. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/where-is-climate-change-in-the-trump-v-clinton-presidential-debates\">Climate change would not have been mentioned at all</a> if it hadn\u2019t been for one question in the second debate from a man in a red sweater named Ken Bone. </p>",

Although the British Dental Association and the Home Office have ruled out this strategy as unethical, Davies\u2019 view has supporters. <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/jack-straw-former-home-secretary-backs-calls-for-age-tests-on-migrant-children-a3373871.html\" title=\"\">Jack Straw</a>, a former Labour home secretary, said he would not have ruled out dental checks for migrants when he was in office.</p> <p>I would like to note that these children are refugees, not \u201cmigrants\u201d, as some reports have taken to calling them. At 14 I was a migrant. I had a home to return to, should the Home Office have suddenly revoked my visa. I had a family in Nigeria, a house, food, clothing and so on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What is the official response to a man or woman fleeing death? Sorry, you are too old to receive kindness?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When your home is a bomb crater and you are forced to leave it because of war, you become a refugee. A nine-year-old Syrian child does not reach France unaccompanied because she wants access to the French job market, or better education, or a better healthcare service. She is a child running for her life.</p> <p>In the 1930s almost 10,000 Jewish children <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jul/29/ursula-kantorowicz-arrives-at-southampton-kindertransport-germany\" title=\"\">arrived in Britain</a>, escaping Nazi persecution. Britons rose to the occasion, quietly and without fuss. There is no reason why this could happen again, if only compassion were allowed back into public discourse.</p> <p>It is the descendants of that generation of Britons who now fret over \u201chow many is too many\u201d, when only a handful have arrived.</p> <p>It is true that some who say they are child refugees may not be children. A 25-year-old might claim to be 16. A 19-year-old might claim to be 14. But what is the official response to a man or woman fleeing death? Sorry, you are too old to receive kindness? Your teeth are too mature for you to be granted refuge?</p> <p>Slowly and steadily, compassion is being leached from the public sphere in this country. Cabinet ministers glibly announce that anyone hiring foreigners should be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/04/amber-rudd-comes-down-on-immigration-and-foreign-workers-video\" title=\"\">named and shamed</a>. Instead of a generation of politicians saying this could be Britain\u2019s finest hour, we are told to barricade, to prepare for siege and to creep away into our bunkers. Instead of standing with the world in crisis, Britain is being urged to shut itself off.</p> <p>It is dangerous to live in a place without compassion. When all the foreigners and migrants and refugees have been sent away, when we have been ferreted out of jobs and schools and NHS hospitals, who will be left to blame? A society without compassion, when it has eaten all the others, will turn inwards and eat itself.</p> <p>The response to the child refugees is an early indicator of what Britain will be like after it leaves the EU.

  "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s always Cork first and Ireland second,\u201d said Roy Keane in a 1997 RTE documentary, Have Boots Will Travel. Keane, now the national football team\u2019s assistant manager, was describing how he replies when people ask where he\u2019s from. However, the reality is this self-proclaimed \u201crebel city\u201d often plays second fiddle to Dublin in terms of attention, influence and media hubbub \u2013 and that even extends to it as a short-break destination. But missing out on Cork is a mistake. This is a city with a little bit of everything, and a touch of magic.</p> <p>Blessed by a location in southern Ireland that means fresh seafood plus lush countryside for dairy produce and livestock, Cork\u2019s food scene is flourishing under the watchful eye of chefs such as Kate Lawlor and Denis Cotter, and at restaurants including Electric, Farmgate Cafe, Fenn\u2019s Quay and Market Lane. Beer thoughts may start with Beamish and Murphy\u2019s but craft breweries, such as award-winner Rising Sons, as well as Elbow Lane, the Franciscan Well, and the Cotton Ball Brewing Co, provide character in a pub scene that is alive, well and adhering to cliches \u2013 in the best possible sense.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"314351f16a965a4f1d352b5ba37b09ed698eb76c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/314351f16a965a4f1d352b5ba37b09ed698eb76c/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Finbarr\u2019s Cathedral in Bishop Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saint Fin Barre\u2019s cathedral in Bishop Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Lonely Planet Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yes, it has its historic attractions.

There\u2019s also a world-renowned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/20/top-10-jazz-festivals-europe-montreux-umbria-cork\">jazz festival</a> in October and annual celebrations of folk music, literature, science and food. What\u2019s more, this is a place built for strolling and has a centre ripe for exploring. It has its dark side, too \u2026 though you can more easily examine that amid the, at times, comic setting of Lisa McInerney\u2019s prize-winning novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-glorious-heresies.html\">The Glorious Heresies</a>.</p> <p>Cork may often have been merely a starting point for those heading west to the rugged, dramatic scenery of the Ring of Kerry, Mizen Head and the Ring of Beara but it is a fascinating jaunt in its own right. The verbal jousting with Dublin about being the \u201creal\u201d capital of Ireland is unlikely to end but pick any month and there\u2019ll be a great event here; pick the right time and an affordable return flight is likely. Cork could be the short-hop stop that turns into the best of adventures.</p> <h2><strong>WHAT TO SEE AND DO</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2159a916f50a4982fb50509907dfc06a6f022077\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2159a916f50a4982fb50509907dfc06a6f022077/0_771_4712_2827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Glucksman Gallery, University College, Cork.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lewis Glucksman Gallery, University College, Cork.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Get on the Fab Food Trail</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s not fast food but fab food.

  "<h2>Snapshot: Me as a teen, through my big sister\u2019s eyes <br></h2> <p>These are two photos of me, both taken by my older sister, Xtine. The colour picture (above) is from the summer of 1962, when I was 14. At that time I was mad about Cliff Richard\u2019s backing group, the Shadows. About six months earlier, I had been given their first LP. On the cover was a colour photo of the group in a casual pose. Hank Marvin and Jet Harris are looking at what appears to be a fan letter. Bruce Welch is looking straight at the camera, but Tony Meehan, the drummer, seems lost in his own thoughts. They are all wearing very distinctive, striped jumpers or cardigans. As Meehan was the drummer, and I played drums in a&#xa0;school rock group, he was my idol.</p> <p>I begged my mother to knit me a zip-up cardigan, as close in pattern and colour to the one Meehan is wearing on the album cover. She did an amazing job, as always, and that\u2019s what I am sporting in the photo.</p> <p>Xtine is seven years older than me. In 1962, she was 21 and already a schoolteacher. Over the next two or three years, she and her new boyfriend had a big influence on my taste in music and clothes and my hairstyle. You can see evidence of that in the second photo (below), which was taken in 1964, the year of Twist and Shout and It\u2019s All Over Now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"225ec77e42531e858049ca706ce6a4771230eebf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/225ec77e42531e858049ca706ce6a4771230eebf/0_0_1063_1068/995.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Tinwell\u2019s sister\u2019s \u2018arty\u2019 shot of him, taken in 1964.\" width=\"995\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ian Tinwell\u2019s sister\u2019s \u2018arty\u2019 shot of him, taken in 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gone is the Shadows-style cardigan, replaced by a black turtleneck jumper and long black scarf (knitted by my mother). Gone are the ice-blue Wranglers, replaced by Levi\u2019s. Gone is the old-fashioned hairstyle, replaced (although you can\u2019t really see it in the photo) by a Beatles-influenced style. It was my sister who persuaded me \u2013 and at first it took a lot of persuasion \u2013 to have a Beatles fringe and let it grow longer.</p> <p>But gradually I embraced it and was the only boy at my school with \u201clong\u201d hair. I was often rebuked by teachers for my \u201cBeatle cut\u201d including, once, the headmaster during morning assembly.

  "<p>Late in the afternoon of 20 April 1968, Enoch Powell called at my grandparents\u2019 house in Westland Avenue, Wolverhampton.</p> <p>A couple of hours earlier, at a hotel in Birmingham, he had delivered one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1968/apr/22/mainsection.ianaitken\" title=\"\">most controversial speeches in British history</a>, in which he issued an apocalyptic warning about what he saw as the dangers of mass immigration. The \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech caused an immediate furore and destroyed Powell\u2019s political ambitions. However, it also came at a personal cost \u2013 as Powell was about to find out.</p> <p>Earlier that afternoon, while the Wolverhampton Tory MP (with wife Pam in the audience) was famously declaring that he was \u201cfilled with foreboding; like the Roman, I seem to see \u2018the river Tiber foaming with much blood,\u2019\u201d my grandparents, Clement and Marjorie Jones, were at home 20 miles away, looking after the Powells\u2019 two daughters, then aged 14 and 11.</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t just neighbours or acquaintances babysitting someone else\u2019s kids for a few hours as a favour. The Powells and the Joneses had by this point been close friends for almost 20 years and did everything together: country walks, meals out and so on.</p> <p>However, like many people that day, my grandparents were shocked and upset by the racist and inflammatory nature of the speech, which was filmed by a television crew and was immediately all over the TV and on radio bulletins. In fact, that very afternoon my grandmother told my grandfather that she never wanted to see Powell again.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My grandmother said to Enoch, \u2018I don\u2019t think we shall be seeing each other again for a very long time.\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So the stage was set for a showdown, because here at the front door were the Powells, who had come to collect their daughters and, presumably, discuss the dramatic events of that day.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdr96F5PfMg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qdr96F5PfMg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>David Frost interviews Enoch Powell in 1969.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>My grandfather \u2013 who at that time was editor of the Wolverhampton Express &amp; Star newspaper \u2013 could not bring himself to face Powell and tell him exactly what he thought of his speech. So it was my grandmother who answered the door.</p> <p>Years later, my grandfather (who died in 2002) revealed exactly what happened on the doorstep that afternoon: \u201cShe was strong-willed and she said to Enoch, \u2018I don\u2019t think we shall be seeing each other again for a very long time.\u2019 Powell said to her, \u2018Well, I suppose it\u2019s the end of a good friendship now, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Yes it is.\u2019 She handed over the two girls and that was it.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately for my grandparents, while it was indeed the end of a near two-decade friendship, it was not the end of the drama. Over the coming months and years, the fallout from the speech continued to reverberate through their&nbsp;lives and, arguably, led to my grandfather taking early retirement from his job as editor of one of the country\u2019s biggest regional newspapers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"735ee80050c414f13f071db56b34569feb9609ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/735ee80050c414f13f071db56b34569feb9609ce/39_16_507_634/400.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Jones\u2019 grandparents Clement and Marjorie with their dog, Topsy.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Jones\u2019 grandparents Clement and Marjorie with their dog, Topsy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, almost 50 years later, the story is going to be played out on the public stage. A new play called What Shadows, set against the backdrop of the rivers of&nbsp;blood speech, is about to receive its&nbsp;world premiere at Birmingham repertory theatre. Ian McDiarmid is playing Enoch Powell, and I\u2019m still trying to get my head around the fact that I\u2019ll soon be watching George Costigan playing my grandfather, with Paula Wilcox taking the role of my grandmother, who died in 1991.</p> <p>Bizarrely, this won\u2019t be the first time I\u2019ve watched actors playing my grandma and grandpa. In September last year, I attended a script reading for another play about the speech, which again features Enoch, Pam, Clem and Marjorie. This play, by Tom Cottle and Tom Miller, will be staged in London next year.</p> <p>I have an extremely small bit part role in this saga: I was born seven days before Powell\u2019s speech, and my mother Pat \u2013 who had met Enoch and Pam at numerous family get-togethers \u2013 was in hospital recovering from a caesarean and listening to the speech and its aftermath on a bedside radio.</p> <p>I remember my grandparents as gentle, intellectual, a little eccentric. But say \u201cEnoch Powell\u201d and what does&nbsp;that name conjure up nowadays? A dyed-in-the-wool Tory somewhere to the right of Attila the Hun, a mad-eyed, racist prophet of doom. So it does, on the face of it, seem like a very unlikely friendship.</p> <p>They certainly didn\u2019t appear to share the same political views. Grandpa played his cards close to his chest, but my father, Nicholas, reckons he was very much left-leaning, while Grandma was \u201clifelong Labour\u201d. And while Powell enjoyed a glittering military career during the second world war \u2013 it is said that for a few weeks he was the youngest brigadier in the British army \u2013 my grandfather had a very different war experience: he was a conscientious objector, having lost his own father during the first world war, and with a&nbsp;wife and three wartime babies to support, it was a challenging few years for the family, during which they faced a lot of hostility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f98a69f1e2666b570dd68d4a98c9687bab9ffdb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f98a69f1e2666b570dd68d4a98c9687bab9ffdb/38_223_3418_2051/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enoch Powell, 1974.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enoch Powell, 1974.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don McPhee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet, as my father explains, the two families had a lot in common. Powell had become a close friend of my grandfather following his election as Conservative MP for Wolverhampton South West in 1950. Both men were on the fast track in their respective careers. My grandfather, then a reporter on the Express &amp; Star, would in just a few years\u2019 time take the top job on the paper, while Powell quickly moved up the political ladder, eventually securing a place in the cabinet. By&nbsp;the start of the 1960s these two men were pillars of the Wolverhampton establishment who would have been frequently thrown together at various&nbsp;events.</p> <p>The two couples lived just a few streets away from each other in Wolverhampton, and were both raising young families during the 1950s and 60s. My dad acknowledges that there was \u201csomething in it\u201d for both men: my grandfather would have been getting access to top-level political news and gossip, while Powell was picking up valuable insider tips on how&nbsp;to secure the most positive press&nbsp;coverage.</p> <p>The two families also bonded over their shared passions: local history, classical literature and the poetry of writers such as AE Housman, whose <a href=\"http://www.housman-society.co.uk/shropshire-lad.htm\" title=\"\">A Shropshire Lad </a>collection was a favourite of my grandfather\u2019s.</p> <p>My grandparents and the Powells were real intellectuals \u2013 as my father puts it, my grandmother was a very well-read woman, and \u201cthe one person who could outquote her was Powell\u201d.</p> <p>Presumably they also talked about politics, though it\u2019s worth remembering that the anti-immigration rants didn\u2019t come until a lot later \u2013 in fact, as health minister during the early 1960s, Powell was encouraging immigrants from the Commonwealth to work in the understaffed NHS.</p> <p>The two couples used to enjoy meals out at local Indian restaurants \u2013 Enoch Powell tucking into chicken tikka masala is certainly an image to conjure with \u2013 and picnics in the Shropshire countryside, which typically involved fairly frugal fare and revolved around an interesting building, castle or site of local interest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ac7a46d6e3d21aa331d389bf00060740aea2db6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ac7a46d6e3d21aa331d389bf00060740aea2db6/9_52_686_411/500.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Jones as a young boy with his parents, Nicholas and Pat, and Marjorie.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Jones as a young boy with his parents, Nicholas and Pat, and Marjorie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR/PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My mum, who had started going out with my dad in 1964, remembers that the Powells \u201cwould often come to tea if we were visiting Wolverhampton\u201d. And after my parents were married in 1966 and had moved to Oxford, my grandparents and Enoch, Pam and their two daughters would come down to visit them.</p> <p>My mother still clearly remembers the time, on one of those Jones-Powell picnics, when Enoch rather put her in her place. They were talking about an apple tart recipe, and my mum, then in&nbsp;her early 20s, asked my grandmother: \u201cDo you have to butter the plate a lot?\u201d Like a schoolmaster correcting an errant pupil, Powell pompously said this was grammatically incorrect and that it should be \u201c\u2026 butter the plate profusely\u201d.</p> <p>During the late 1960s the first cracks were starting to appear in the friendship. My father says he began to detect signs of a slight uneasiness in the relationship between my grandfather and Powell.</p> <p>They had a disagreement following a March 1968 speech in which Powell talked about a local girl who was allegedly the only white child in her class at primary school. My grandfather questioned the veracity of this claim after reporters from his paper failed to track down either the girl or the class.</p> <p>A few weeks later, Powell told my grandparents he was planning another speech, to be delivered on 20 April. He would not disclose what he was going to say, but said mysteriously: \u201cYou know how a rocket goes up into the air, explodes into lots of stars and then falls down to the ground? Well, this speech is going to go up like a rocket, and when it gets up to the top, the stars are going to stay up.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, his firework analogy was spot-on: this was one hell of an explosive speech. And while the friendship shattered on the doorstep that afternoon, my grandfather, as editor of the&nbsp;local newspaper, still had to cover the speech and its consequences.</p> <p>Edward Heath immediately sacked Powell from his shadow cabinet, but it seemed that in the eyes of many Express &amp; Star readers, the MP was a hero. My grandfather reckoned that 90% to 95% of the readers\u2019 letters they received were pro-Enoch, but he was determined to also publish any that did arrive that attacked the speech. That stand led to him receiving some abusive letters, some \u201ccontaining excrement and that sort of thing \u2026 I had people ringing me at home, all sorts of hours, saying, \u2018Oh, is that the bloody nigger lover?\u2019\u2026 I had a couple of windows broken at home.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/12/enoch-powell-hanif-kureishi\">Hanif Kureishi: Knock, knock, it\u2019s Enoch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Powell later started libel proceedings against the Express &amp; Star for an article that mentioned a protester at a demonstration who was carrying a placard accusing the MP of Nazi-style tactics. The case was eventually settled, but three months later my grandfather accepted early retirement.</p> <p>So did they ever speak to each other again? My dad says that my grandmother was very principled and never wavered in her conviction that a line had been unforgivably crossed. However, he thinks that my grandfather was more pragmatic and softened as the years went on, to the point that he felt able to attend Powell\u2019s 80th birthday party in 1992.</p> <p><em>\u2022 What Shadows is at </em><a href=\"https://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/whats-on/what-shadows.html\" title=\"\"><em>Birmingham repertory theatre</em></a><em> from 27 October to 12&nbsp;November</em></p>",

Mine, as you can see, was so soft it squelched every time a slice was cut \u2013messy, but oh so moreish.</p> <p><strong>Makes 16-20</strong><br><strong>For the biscuit layer</strong><br>120g butter<br>50g sugar<br>150g plain flour<br>20g cornflour<br>\u00bd tsp ground ginger<br>\u00bd tsp ground cinnamon<br>\u00bc tsp ground cardamon<br>\u00bc tsp ground cloves<br>A pinch of ground coriander</p> <p><strong> For the caramel layer</strong><br>270g condensed milk<br>40g soft brown sugar<br>130g butter<br>1 tsp vanilla paste<br>1 tsp sea salt</p> <p><strong> For the topping</strong><br>200g dark chocolate<br>A pinch of cayenne pepper</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Set the oven to 150C/300/gas mark 2 and lightly grease a small baking tin.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Cream together the butter and sugar, then sift in the flour, cornflour and spices. Rub it together to create a fine breadcrumb texture. Press this firmly into the base of your prepared tin, bake it for 15 minutes, then leave to cool.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Combine the condensed milk, brown sugar and butter in a medium pan and melt on a low heat. Stir and increase the heat a little to bring it to a gentle boil. It should have thickened a little and darkened in colour a bit when it\u2019s ready. Stir in the sea salt and vanilla.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Pour the warm caramel over the cooled shortbread and set in the fridge \u2013 up to 40 minutes.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Melt the chocolate with the cayenne pepper, then spread over the caramel layer. Leave to set before slicing.</p> <h2><strong>Miso, white chocolate and sesame biscuits</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/guardianUser16004424\"><em>Anna Thomson</em></a>\u2019s cookies were pastry chef James\u2019s first choice. He suggested slicing them as thinly as possible, for something truly delicate.</p> <p><strong>Makes 15-20</strong><br>80g sugar<br>20g sweet white miso<br>100g butter, softened<br>1 egg, beaten<br>200g plain flour<br>20g flaked almonds<br>10g black sesame seeds, toasted <br>45g white chocolate chips</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Beat the sugar, miso and butter together. Add the egg and mix well. Sift the flour into the bowl, add the almonds, sesame seeds and chocolate. Mix with your hands into a dough.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Roll into logs, wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and line two baking trays with baking parchment.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> When chilled, take the dough logs out of the fridge and cut into 5mm slices. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.</p> <h2><strong>Coffee cardamom cake</strong></h2> <p>My fellow testers were keen to add a garnish of candied peel or caramelised orange slices to <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/Fadime\"><em>Fadime Tiskaya</em></a>\u2019s cake, and James suggested serving it with something creamy \u2013 jersey cream, ice\u2011cream, custard or whipped cream, Quo Vadis pudding-menu style.</p> <p><strong>Serves 8-10</strong><br>50g strong, hot espresso<br>3 tsp ground cardamom<br>225g butter<br>225g caster sugar<br>Zest of 1 orange<br>3 large or 4 medium eggs<br>320g plain flour<br>2 tsp baking powder<br>100g ground almonds<br>50g whole milk<br>100g plain sesame halva, crumbled</p> <p><strong>1 </strong>Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Grease a 23cm cake tin and set aside.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Mix together the prepared hot coffee and cardamom and set aside until cold. (You can mix the cardamom with dry coffee then make the coffee in the usual way).</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Beat the butter, sugar and orange zest until fluffy. Mix in the eggs one by one, if it starts curdling add some flour after each egg. Sieve together the flour, baking powder and ground almonds and fold into the butter mixture. Mix in the milk, coffee, and crumbled halva. Pour into the tin and bake for about 40 minutes.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Sprinkle with icing sugar and extra orange zest to serve.</p>"
