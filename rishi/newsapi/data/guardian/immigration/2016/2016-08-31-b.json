  "<p>Following their meeting on Wednesday, Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, insisted he told Donald Trump, during their meeting in Mexico City, that Mexico would not pay for a border wall between their two countries.</p> <p>\u201cAt the start of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall,\u201d Pe\u00f1a Nieto <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EPN/status/771118159654891520\">tweeted</a>. A spokesman for the Mexican president later told the Guardian that there was no discussion of paying for the wall because Trump did not respond to Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s statement. \u201cThe president told him clearly and the matter was not discussed further.\u201d </p> <p>Trump had told reporters after the meeting that while the pair had discussed a border wall, the topic of who would pay for it did not come up. \u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss payment of the wall. That\u2019ll be for a later date,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign later released a statement that did not directly address the controversy.</p> <p>\u201cToday was the first part of the discussion and a relationship builder between Mr Trump and President Pe\u00f1a Nieto. It was not a negotiation, and that would have been inappropriate. It is unsurprising that they hold two different views on this issue, and we look forward to continuing the conversation.\u201d</p> <p>A Trump source with knowledge of the meeting later added to the Guardian, \u201cboth parties knew each other\u2019s positions going into today, and we didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to start negotiating during this meeting.\u201d</p> <p>Pe\u00f1a Nieto had faced a wave of domestic criticism for inviting Trump to see him at Los Pinos, the residence of the Mexican president. The controversy came just hours after Trump left Mexico City for Arizona, where he was due to hold a major policy speech on immigration that same evening. </p> <p>The two met for an hour and then appeared before reporters to make separate statements about their unusual summit.</p> <p>Speaking at a podium next to Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Trump did his utmost to appear presidential on his second trip abroad and first meeting with a head of state as a candidate. However, in doing so, Trump seemed to continue <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-pena-nieto-immigration-arizona\">the \u201csoftening\u201d of his rhetoric</a> on immigration in advance of his policy speech on the topic, which he was to deliver later on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Speaking at the podium in restrained and almost subdued tones, Trump described undocumented immigrants as those entering the United States \u201cwithout legal authorization\u201d, praised first-, second- and third-generation Mexican Americans as \u201cbeyond reproach\u201d and talked about keeping jobs \u201cin our hemisphere\u201d. This was in addition to Trump\u2019s concession to reporters afterwards that while he had discussed building a border wall with Pe\u00f1a Nieto, he did not even bring up his <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/05/donald-trump-mexico-border-wall-plan-remittances\">signature proposal that Mexico would pay for such a wall</a>. </p> <p>This served as a major contrast to Trump\u2019s fiery and often bombastic tone on the campaign trail. </p> <p>He launched his candidacy in June 2015 by accusing Mexico of deliberately sending criminals and \u201crapists\u201d to the US and has since claimed that a federal judge, Gustavo Curiel, could not do his job impartially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/03/donald-trump-judge-curiel-university-case-biased-mexican\">because of his Mexican heritage</a>. At almost every campaign rally since then, Trump has held a call and response with his rambunctious crowds, asking: \u201cWho is going to pay for the wall?\u201d The shouted answer has invariably been: \u201cMexico.\u201d</p> <p>The Republican nominee has also repeatedly bashed free trade agreements, like Nafta, which he has said allows US workers to lose their jobs to Mexicans; as well as attacking specific companies for shifting their operations to Mexico. </p> <p>While it was speculated that Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who has a 23% approval rating in his own country, might berate Trump for political gain, the Mexican president took a rather restrained stance speaking before his guest. </p> <p>He praised Trump for the \u201copen and constructive\u201d conversation they had. The Mexican president also did not directly criticize any of the controversial and racially charged remarks Trump has made since launching his campaign last year. Rather, Pe\u00f1a Nieto rebutted them indirectly by praising Mexican Americans.</p> <p>\u201cThey are honest people, working people \u2013 they are people that respect family, they respect the life in the community and they are respective of the law. As such, Mexicans deserve everybody\u2019s respect.\u201d Although Pe\u00f1a Nieto pointedly defended Nafta, a longstanding target of ire for Trump, he concede the free trade agreement \u201ccould be improved\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"811c8e5e49aafe501608c2f8f866a26ce747200b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/811c8e5e49aafe501608c2f8f866a26ce747200b/0_472_5362_3218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump Mexico City\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators hold placards during a protest against the visit of Donald Trump in Mexico City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tomas Bravo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mexicans reacted with outrage to Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s perceived deference and refusal to be tough with Trump. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t recall a time in the last 50 years when a Mexican president was so thoroughly humiliated in his own home,\u201d said Esteban Illades, editor of the intellectual and current affairs magazine Nexos. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cPe\u00f1a Nieto managed to make Trump look presidential while making himself look incredibly small. He ended up accepting an apology from Trump, even though Trump never even offered a half-hearted one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c@EPN reinforced in the US the stereotype of the docile Mexican, who you can insult and mock without consequences. The damage is done,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/jorgesuarezv/status/771090300102184961\">tweeted</a> author Jorge Su\u00e1rez-V\u00e9lez.</p> <p>On Wednesday evening, Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, Claudia Ruiz Massieu, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ruizmassieu/status/771140787891384320\">tweeted</a> in Spanish that the president had, during the meeting with Trump, \u201cexpressed the grievance and outrage of Mexicans at insults and offenses\u201d.</p> <p>Pe\u00f1a Nieto entered the meeting as Mexico\u2019s most unpopular president since polling on presidential approval started in the mid-1990s. Analysts expect the encounter to diminish Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s popularity even further, especially since many Mexicans were expecting a robust response to a presidential candidate whose protectionist policies could cost Mexico economically. </p> <p>\u201cPe\u00f1a Nieto claims he is just trying to protect Mexicans. How, by welcoming to Mexico the candidate who has portrayed them as the enemy?\u201d said Carlos Bravo Regidor, a journalism professor at the Centre for Research and Teaching in Economics. \u201cThis is more than a diplomatic blunder. This is a mistake of global proportions.\u201d</p> <p>The event was held just hours before Trump\u2019s scheduled speech on immigration in Phoenix, Arizona, and came as the Republican nominee is trying to pivot to appeal to moderate suburban voters that he alienated during his primary campaign. </p> <p>In recent days, Trump has shifted away from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">his calls for \u201ca deportation force\u201d</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/21/donald-trump-deportation-immigration-plan-meeting-latino-leaders\">deporting all 11 million illegal immigrants</a> in the US within two years of taking office. </p> <p>Instead, he has flip-flopped in the past week about a potential path to legal status for undocumented immigrants and attacked the media for even focusing on the issue. </p> <p>\u201cIn recent days, the media \u2013 as it usually does \u2013 has missed the whole point on immigration. All the media wants to talk about is the 11 million or more people here illegally,\u201d Trump told voters in Iowa on Saturday.</p> <p>The campaign heralded Trump\u2019s trip, where he was accompanied by Alabama senator Jeff Sessions and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani as a sign of Trump\u2019s statesmanship. </p> <p>In a statement, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Mike Pence, said: \u201cWhat the American people are seeing today is the kind of decisive president Donald J Trump will be. This meeting begins a relationship where we can talk about the issues we\u2019ve got to resolve between the United States and Mexico, as well as the issues we have in common.\u201d</p> <p>It didn\u2019t publicize this statesmanship as much as it could have. Trump\u2019s campaign intentionally left the traveling press corps in the United States and prevented reporters from coming along, something the campaign treasurer, Jeff DeWit, bragged about at the campaign rally in Phoenix on Wednesday night.</p> <p>John Podesta, the chair of the Clinton campaign, mocked Trump for not pressing for Mexico to pay for the border wall in his meeting with Pe\u00f1a Nieto. </p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump has made his outlandish policy of forcing Mexico to pay for his giant wall the centerpiece of his campaign,\u201d said Podesta. \u201cBut at the first opportunity to make good on his offensive campaign promises, Trump choked. What we saw today from a man who claims to be the ultimate \u2018deal maker\u2019 is that he doesn\u2019t have the courage to advocate for his campaign promises when he\u2019s not in front of a friendly crowd.\u201d</p> <p> After Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s tweet, Podesta revised his statement: \u201cIt turns out Trump didn\u2019t just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it.\u201d</p>",

On top of that, if she signs over ownership to the city, for resale, she will still have to keep making loan payments for a car she no longer possesses.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cOh god, it\u2019s been a nightmare,\u201d Harjo, who works in customer service for Southwest Airlines, said. \u201cI\u2019m losing sleep over it, thinking, \u2018Oh god I have to pay this loan\u2019 and I can\u2019t buy another car until I pay this loan off. And then the waiting game, I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take.\u201d</p> <p>People whose vehicles are impounded are on the hook for $50 for an administrative hearing, and $10 in lot fees for every day their car is in the impound, according to <a href=\"http://reason.com/blog/2016/08/31/new-mexico-passed-a-law-ending-civil-for\">Reason.com</a>, who first reported on Harjo\u2019s case.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The city made $8.3m from civil asset forfeiture of vehicles alone between 2010 and 2015, according to the <a href=\"https://www.abqjournal.com/575256/you-dont-have-to-be-driving-to-lose-your-car.html\">Albuquerque Journal</a>, seizing more than 1,000 cars every year.</p> <p>According to Robert Everett Johnson, an attorney with the Institute for Justice who is representing Harjo, the incentive structure is broken; the salaries of those running the civil asset forfeiture program for the city comes directly out of the program.</p> <p>\u201cSo you can imagine why they are so hesitant to give this up,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the constitutional problem here: the government shouldn\u2019t have a financial incentive to take money from innocent people, but they have exactly that incentive. That\u2019s why they\u2019re going after innocent people like Arlene, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re not following the reform law.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, city attorney Jessica Hernandez said in an email: \u201cThe City\u2019s DWI forfeiture ordinance is exempt from the New Mexico civil forfeiture act according to the state law\u2019s own terms. The City\u2019s program is a narrowly-tailored nuisance abatement law to protect the public from dangerous, repeat DWI offenders and the vehicles they use to commit DWI offenses, placing innocent citizens\u2019 lives and property at risk. The ordinance provides protections for innocent owners to get their vehicles back at an early stage in the process. Like all cases, we will review and evaluate this case\u2019s individual circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>In April, Harjo\u2019s son borrowed her Nissan to go to the gym, but was then pulled over for drunk driving and the car was impounded.</p> <p>\u201cI went [to court] the first time,\u201d Harjo said, \u201cand they told me they wanted me to sign a disclaimer\u201d to transfer ownership of the car to the city for re-sale. Or she had to pay the city $4,000. \u201cI told them I didn\u2019t have $4,000.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The government continued to pressure Harjo to sign the disclaimer, but she fought back, at first representing herself and then with the help of the Institute for Justice, a group that has campaigned against civil asset forfeiture. \u201cThe judge [was] making me feel like it was my fault, making me feel like I\u2019d done something wrong, making me feel intimidated,\u201d she said.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Johnson and Harjo filed both an <a href=\"http://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Harjo-Amended-Answer-Aug-2016-IJ080892xA6322.pdf\">answer</a> to the government\u2019s civil forfeiture suit, and a counter-claim and separate civil action challenging the legality and constitutionality of Albuquerque\u2019s civil asset forfeiture program.</p> <p>The Institute for Justice has tried to challenge the program in court before, in a <a href=\"https://www.abqjournal.com/678063/state-senators-sue-albuquerque-over-its-seizures.html\">November 2015 lawsuit</a> brought by two state senators against the city. But a judge dismissed the case, saying that the legislators were not the appropriate parties to bring the case.</p> <p>\u201cThis is something we\u2019ve been watching, and want to stop \u2013 because of the size of the program, but also New Mexico\u2019s reforms, which were some of the first and still some of the most protective reforms in the country,\u201d Johnson said. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to us to see those reforms implemented, so local governments are not able to create what amounts to a loophole,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cThe city\u2019s program is a narrowly-tailored nuisance abatement law to protect the public from dangerous, repeat DWI offenders and the vehicles they use to commit DWI offenses, placing innocent citizens\u2019 lives and property at risk,\u201d city attorney Jessica Hernandez said in a statement. \u201cThe ordinance provides protections for innocent owners to get their vehicles back at an early stage in the process.

  "<p>Johanna Konta collapsed to her knees midway through her match in stifling heat at the US Open before recovering to record an astonishing and controversial win in three sets over the Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova. The incident sent a worrying shiver through the tournament as high humidity drained even the fittest players \u2013 and few are better conditioned than the British No1.</p> <p>A set up but fading physically towards the end of the second on an exposed outside court, Konta served on set point against her, fell woozily to the ground and was seriously distressed as she grabbed for her breath. For seven minutes she sat on a towel with ice packs wrapped around her before waving away concerned attendants to sit on her courtside chair. She rose unsteadily and returned to double-fault and surrender the set, then left the court to change her clothes before resuming.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/31/andy-murray-us-open-marcel-granollers-second-round\">Andy Murray ready to face Marcel Granollers in US Open second round</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although still breathing hard and looking less than great, Konta conjured a magnificent comeback, full of artful drop shots, lobs and passing shots, to win 6-2, 5-7, 6-2 in two hours and 32 minutes. She was so exhausted she could not celebrate. If she is fit, she will play on Friday against the Swiss Belinda Bencic, who beat Andrea Petkovic 6-3, 6-2.</p> <p>Konta, who revealed she had collapsed in similar conditions in the United States four years ago, said, \u201cI was feeling a little bit the conditions, and also my own energy levels [crashed]. Basically my heart rate spiked and I couldn\u2019t really control my breathing. I started hyperventilating. I started shaking. That\u2019s why I went down on the ground, because I was quite violently shaking.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019d experienced it once before I didn\u2019t start crying. I don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s had a panic attack but that\u2019s basically what it feels like. I\u2019m doing everything I can to recover well and try to get myself into a state to be ready to compete again on Thursday, Friday. I don\u2019t know what day it is. I feel quite certain that, with some TLC, I\u2019ll be good to go again in a few days\u2019 time.\u201d</p> <p>Konta denied she had manipulated the situation for an extended break between sets. \u201cThe medical timeout was right at the end of that second set. I guess it worked out that way but I needed to get changed out of my clothes. I was soaked through. I did the best I could with the cards that I had. My opponent, she was gracious, and she was also very understanding of the situation that was going on.\u201d</p> <p>Pironkova said Konta deserved her win but she described the conditions as: \u201cNot that bad compared to other days\u201d.</p> <p>She added: \u201cObviously, she wasn\u2019t feeling well. I could see that. When you see the player that you\u2019re playing against look like this, that you couldn\u2019t stand, it\u2019s scary, I think. I was hoping she will get through that and that she will be OK.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was frustrating for me was what happened after that, the toilet break. Because, with that toilet break, I think the match was stopped for just too long. And it was an unfortunate time. I had my momentum going. I was getting back in the match because I had a hard start.\u201d</p> <p>Pironkova did not notice any change in Konta at the end. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say her game was struggling or anything. She played the same way that she played before.\u201d</p> <p>Kyle Edmund had a way more straightforward route into the third round than his compatriot. The forehand he put beyond the reach of the young American underdog Ernesto \u201cNito\u201d Escobedo to win their second-round match was the British player\u2019s 54th clean winner of the match, his 94th of the tournament.</p> <p>If the 21-year-old Yorkshireman is to create an even bigger stir by beating John Isner in the third round on Friday, he will need all the gathering strength in that strong, freckled right arm to reach the second week of the tournament.</p> <p>Edmund\u2019s cannon is his forehand and that is where 49 of his winners have come from in the space of three days, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/29/kyle-edmund-richard-gasquet-us-open-first-round\" title=\"\">straight-sets wins over the still-dangerous Frenchman Richard Gasquet</a> on Monday and the Californian Escobedo, the wiry 20-year-old son a of Mexican truck driver.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of good things today,\u201d Edmund said courtside after winning 7-5, 6-4, 6-4 \u2013 and before he had heard Isner had beaten the Belgian qualifier Steve Darcis in four sets on Louis Armstrong.</p>",

  "<p>If I had my way, the new year would start tomorrow. After the purgatory of August as the nation\u2019s holiday, autumnal September is when we return to work, supposedly regenerated.

It looks not at what \u201ccould\u201d happen but at what \u201chas\u201d happened. Norberg is a prophet of anti-pessimism. He is shocked by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2015/jan/16/declinism-is-the-world-actually-getting-worse\" title=\"\">a 2015 YouGov poll that found 71% of Britons convinced \u201cthe world is getting worse\u201d</a>, against just 5% who said it was getting better. More than half thought world poverty was rising, against 10% who thought it falling. It was the same in the US.</p> <p>Norberg points out that every index of global improvement \u2013 measuring starvation, poverty, child mortality, literacy, women\u2019s education, democracy, violence, death in war \u2013 shows a steady upward graph. It is easy to retort, \u201cBut what about Syria and the Congo?\u201d When an argument is general, the objection must be general.</p> <p>What exercises Norberg is that progress deniers risk generating what he&#xa0;calls \u201cnativist backlash\u201d. To him, \u201cWhen we don\u2019t see the progress we have made, we begin to search for scapegoats for the problems that remain.\u201d Misinformed about the improving state of the world, people wander about under a cloud of superstition and fear. They soon accept&#xa0;the authoritarian \u201ccurtailment of&#xa0;the freedom and openness that progress depends on\u201d. They vote for Ukip and Trump.</p> <p>The politics of fear has become the default mode of democratic politics. The desensitising word crisis is applied to any and every problem. The <a href=\"http://www.cato.org/policy-report/septemberoctober-2014/most-dangerous-world-ever\" title=\"\">chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff can \u201cpersonally attest \u2026 that the world is more dangerous than it has ever been\u201d. </a>He had no evidence, just a budget to defend. Most of us belong to a tribe, with tribal interests at stake. The left seizes on evidence of inequality, ignoring absolute prosperity. The right seizes on moral degeneracy, with the philosopher <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9888780/John-Gray-interview-how-an-English-academic-become-the-worlds-pre-eminent-prophet-of-doom.html\" title=\"\">John Gray</a> warning of \u201cthe approaching end of civilisation\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The politics of fear has become the default mode of politics. The word crisis is applied to any and every problem</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cue the latest chase. Brexit was a triumph for the pessimist tendency. Its theme was that Britain was doomed if immigration were not controlled and the country released from bondage to Brussels. Now that the remainers\u2019 Project Fear has been shown to be exaggerated, Brexit must tone down its own gloom. It must see some virtue in European co-operation, and build a new relationship of continental trust. Given the recent past, this will be a hard sell, but sold it must be. Optimism must become a strategy.</p> <p>A running theme of Norberg\u2019s book is the dependence of such political argument on the media. He is right. Almost the entire Brexit debate \u2013 one of the most passionate and intriguing in modern British politics \u2013 was conducted as a contest of competing menaces. This was no surprise. The media depends on bad news \u201cto sell newspapers\u201d, but newspapers are veritable libraries of congress compared with internet news sites, drenched in polarisation. I still think the internet has contributed to the diversity of public debate, but even an optimist finds this a close call.</p> <p>Journalists customarily defend themselves from the charge of distortion by claiming their job is to report deviations from the norm of progress. Good news is rarely news. We report plane crashes and divorces, not take-offs and happy marriages.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/31/theresa-may-brexit-ministers-cabinet-eu\">At Theresa May\u2019s Brexit awayday, spats and spin must be put aside | Mary Dejevsky</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This does not excuse such scaremongering as the claim that the 2014 Ebola outbreak could infect \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/23/ebola-cdc-millions-infected-quarantine-africa-epidemic\" title=\"\">1.4 million people by 2015</a>\u201d.

But governments are easily terrorised into doing the wrong thing. In the case of bird flu, the diversion of medical resources was said to have caused more deaths than the epidemic itself.</p> <p>By far the most positive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/nov/19/better-angels-nature-steven-pinker-review\" title=\"\">sign of humanity\u2019s advance is the decline in global violence</a>, on a state and personal level.

These include nations becoming inherently more \u201cpacifist\u201d, the \u201cfeminising\u201d of politics, the growing power of reason and \u201cthe expanding circle of sympathy\u201d. He, like Norberg, is puzzled by the potency of pessimism.</p> <p>My optimistic future sees the post-digital age as putting live experience back at the centre of human activity. Machines will serve humans ever more efficiently, but not enslave us, as Harari miserably predicts. But that is the future. Optimism\u2019s trump card is the past and present. It is facts. These too can lie, but those who say so must prove it.</p>",
  "<p>This was compelling political theatre. On Wednesday Theresa May sent the country a message about authority. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/no-staying-in-eu-by-back-door-theresa-may-brexit\">Summoning the cabinet to Chequers</a> and then summoning the television cameras to record her opening statement, she was saying unmistakably: \u201cKeep calm and remember who\u2019s boss.\u201d</p> <p>But the pith of her short message \u2013 no covert attempt to stay inside the EU, no second referendum \u2013 made clear which side she is coming down on, despite No 10\u2019s \u201cmotherhood and apple pie\u201d briefing that Britain\u2019s future relationship with Europe will involve controls on immigration and be good for trade. The simple truth is that much as we may want access to the single market with no free movement of labour, that is not, and never will be, on offer. By promising to push ahead so firmly with no second referendum and no early general election, May has given comfort to the hardline cabinet Brexiteers.</p> <p>We know now that her first priority is Conservative unity, even above an easy election victory. Some Tory commentators and politicians are horrified that she has not chosen to go to the country early. Labour, they say, is in a worse state to fight an election than for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_(UK)\">35 years</a>, riven from top to bottom. This is the moment to strike, they plead. You shouldn\u2019t waste chances like this.</p> <p>But May is a cool customer, and she has decided to play long. I assume that during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/12/theresa-may-seeks-peace-and-quiet-on-alpine-walking-holiday\">her Alpine walking holiday</a> she concluded that she has nothing to fear from other parties and everything to fear from her own.</p> <p>If, as the polls strongly suggest, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourleadership\">Jeremy Corbyn wins the Labour leadership again</a>, there will be moves in the parliamentary Labour party for a breakaway, plunging constituency parties into the turmoil of loyalty oaths and feuds. If (unlikely, I know) it\u2019s Owen Smith, the base and the leadership will be at war. Either way, it doesn\u2019t seem likely that the official opposition will grow more appealing or stronger in the next few years. Let them stew and twist, seems to be May\u2019s approach.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/31/theresa-may-tells-cabinet-no-back-door-attempts-to-stay-in-eu-brexit-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xkgk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2691920\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May tells cabinet 'no back door attempts to stay in EU' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c6c1a5e4b0df5f040dbf5f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/31/160831Cabinet_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/31/160831Cabinet_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/31/160831Cabinet.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/31/theresa-may-tells-cabinet-no-back-door-attempts-to-stay-in-eu-brexit-video\">Theresa May tells cabinet \u2018no back door attempts to stay in EU\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This has profoundly disturbing implications.

And perhaps what she\u2019s doing is carefully giving rope to the hard right, so they can hang themselves. Plenty of time \u2013 no election yet, no \u201cbackdoor\u201d EU membership \u2013 let\u2019s see what Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox actually come back with from their negotiations. If it\u2019s grim for business and prosperity by the time of a 2020 general election, the right will be discredited.</p> <p>However, there is a darker possibility, which is that May isn\u2019t playing a tactical game; that she has accepted their agenda. In normal political times the not insignificant number of Tory MPs who don\u2019t like Brexit would be able to argue for delay, for another chance for the electorate to have their say, pointing out that getting the terms of Brexit wrong would be a gift to Labour.</p> <p>But at the moment, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/aug/31/corbyn-labour-leadership-yougov-poll-leadership-with-increased-majority-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57c6c6c2e4b0df5f040dbf89#block-57c6c6c2e4b0df5f040dbf89\">opinion polling suggesting</a> a future Tory majority of well over 100 seats, there is no political pressure at all. Labour\u2019s rhetoric about \u201ctaking the fight to the Tories\u201d seems merely forlorn.</p> <p>The Tories are waiting and watching for a Jeremy Corbyn victory followed by the deselections of \u201cBlairites\u201d and moderates. Labour\u2019s battles will be vicious and local, and will leave lasting scars across the political landscape.

Dahl\u2019s book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory first appeared in 1964; Mel Stuart\u2019s retitled adaptation came in 1971. But with Wilder\u2019s passing last week, the world also mourned the passing of the man synonymous with that of the mercurial candy man.</p> <p>Widely seen and deeply felt, Wilder\u2019s portrayal of the man behind the world\u2019s strangest chocolate factory resonated with children everywhere \u2013 but also in the hearts and minds of inchoate pastry chefs who were inspired by the edible teacup and everlasting gobstopper. Rarely mentioned as a food movie, per se, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory inspired generations to enter into a world of pure imagination. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a kid, you\u2019re supposed to identify with Charlie Bucket but I grew up wanting to be Willy Wonka</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Skurnick</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>Daniel Skurnick</strong></h2> <p><em>Pastry chef, <a href=\"http://www.lecoucou.com/\">Le Coucou</a>, New York</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Willy Wonka\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src= &quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/08/31/look.gif&quot;style=width:100%;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>As a kid, you\u2019re supposed to identify with Charlie Bucket but I grew up wanting to be Willy Wonka. Now, as someone who works in the kitchen, I recognize Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory as the ultimate food movie. It has everything we deal with in our professional lives: disputes with labor, doing paper work in a cramped office, mass production in a factory setting, recipe development, innovation and technology. There\u2019s cleaning and maintenance after Augustus Gloop contaminates the chocolate river. </p> <p> But as a kid, it gave me permission to think that maybe it\u2019s not so bad to cloister yourself away, as Wonka did, to create fantastical magical creations. As pastry chefs, I like to say we\u2019re back of back of house. But we know what we do will reach the right hands. </p> <h2><strong>Jacques Torres</strong></h2> <p><em>Chocolate maker, <a href=\"http://www.mrchocolate.com/\">Jacques Torres</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Willy Wonka\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/08/31/eating-compressor.gif&quot;style=width:100%;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>As a Frenchman, I didn\u2019t grow up with this movie. I saw it only when I came to America in my thirties. But Wilder did have a big influence on every professional because he transformed his profession into a dream. He conveyed a fantasy of the profession. That\u2019s his legacy. Though I didn\u2019t see it until I was grown up, he still taught me that the world of chocolate is very much like a dream. It doesn\u2019t have to be that serious. </p> <p>I once met Wilder one day on the plane going to Europe. I said, \u201cMy name is Jacques Torres, I\u2019m Mr Chocolate.\u201d He was very kind.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He taught us to keep everything whimsical and innocent and honest</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>Ron Paprocki</strong></h2> <p><em>Pastry chef, <a href=\"http://gothambarandgrill.com/\">Gotham Bar and Grill</a>, New York</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Willy Wonka\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/08/31/mushroom.gif&quot; style=width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>I was a huge Gene Wilder fan from Silver Streak, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I saw it a few years after it came out, probably when I was six or seven years old. It has meant more to me as I\u2019ve grown older. Especially when I started my professional life. It\u2019s a sort of permission to find fantasy in food, especially sweets. </p> <p>He taught us to keep everything whimsical and innocent and honest. And yet, there was an undercurrent of complexity. Take, for example, the everlasting gobstopper to the three course dinner chewing gum. Something that appeared very neutral was so complex. Carrying that theme into desserts, as pastry chefs we want to create a dessert that is not only memorable but also with a twist. Doing a classic with a modern twist \u2013 like our Black Forest dessert we\u2019re running now \u2013 is certainly a legacy of Wonka. He was the early culinary pioneer if you will. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What Wonka did with the manipulation of expectation, is exactly what so many chefs are chasing today.</p> <footer> <cite>Alex Stupak</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>Alex Stupak</strong></h2> <p><em>Chef and owner <a href=\"http://www.empellon.com/\">Empellon</a>, New York</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Willy Wonka\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/08/31/teacup.gif&quot;  style=width:100%;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The scene that stands out to me and is my favorite in the movie is when Gene Wilder is singing and he stops for a minute and he picks up this little teacup flower. It\u2019s a butter cup. He takes a sip out of it and then he eats the cup. I watched that movie when I was young and I had no idea what surrealism was. But that idea \u2013 that things don\u2019t need to be what they seem \u2013 always stuck with me. Before elBulli\u2019s Ferran Adri\u00e0 or Heston Blumenthal, it was in that film. What Wonka did with simple concepts of reversalism and the manipulation of expectation, is exactly what those (and so many other) chefs are chasing today.</p> <p>The other aspect was that though Wonka dealt in fantasy and pleasure for children and adults alike, Wilder injected a healthy dose of dark sarcasm. It alludes to something in general in the food industry that usually the person trying to make everyone happy could be a little crazy. They\u2019re definitely driven by ego and there\u2019s a ton of hard work that goes on behind the scenes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The encouragement to play with your food has always rung true for me.</p> <footer> <cite>Wylie Dufresne</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>Wylie Dufresne</strong></h2> <p><em>Chef and owner, <a href=\"http://www.wd-50.com/\">wd-50</a>, New York</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Willy Wonka\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/08/31/blueberry.gif&quot; style=width:100%;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve seen Willy Wonka many, many times in my youth and as recently as last week.

The encouragement to play with your food has always rung true for me. </p> <p>I love the concept of compound flavors which Wonka embodied in a chewing gum that contained an entire a Thanksgiving meal all the way to desert. You can see that influence in things like Grant Achatz pre-Alinea <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/restaurants/ct-next-trio-review-vettel-20141009-20141008-story.html\">postage stamp-size pizza</a>. But more generally, any time someone tells you you can think freely or encourages you to experiment, to think creatively, to have fun, to be playful, we can thank Mr Wilder as well as people like myself for legitimate ideas and inspiration.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What fascinated me as a kid was the idea of candy being more than something you ate but rather, an engulfing experience</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>Dana Cree</strong></h2> <p><em>Executive pastry chef, <a href=\"http://www.thepublicanrestaurant.com/reservations/\">The Publican</a>, Chicago</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Willy Wonka\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/08/31/cooking.gif&quot; style=width:100%;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>To me Willy Wonka was the fairy princess story. There\u2019s a storyline that\u2019s fed to girls, that a normal girl that she\u2019s actually a princess and discovers this royal world waiting for me. Willy Wonka was that story to me. I wanted to discover I was actually an heir to the candy throne. What fascinated me as a kid was the idea of candy being more than something you ate but being, rather, an engulfing experience. I don\u2019t know if I ever licked the walls of my room, but I remember I dreamed about it and I remember begging my mother to let me have a Willy Wonka birthday party. We were going to transform my basement into the Pure Imagination room. It never came to fruition.</p> <p>I grew up north of Seattle. We didn\u2019t have a lot of money growing up so I related quite a bit to Charlie. I used to hate watching that song Cheer up, Charlie. They had to eat lettuce soup which, I thought, meant they must have been the poorest of the poor. That stuck with me: the fear of lettuce soup. Now I\u2019ve been at Michelin three star restaurants and have been served lettuce soup. Everyone thought, \u201cOooh, avant garde.\u201d But I realized it was triggering an actual fear of becoming that poor.</p> <p>One lasting effect of Wonka on my work is embodied in the that edible teacup. Wonka picks it up, drinks the nectar and the the cup itself becomes a piece of candy. It\u2019s triple-fold: you think it\u2019s one thing, it looks like something else and it\u2019s actually a third. Those elements of wonder and childlike-surprise are something that I still strive for. We just put a cookie jar on the menu at the Publican. I went and collected cookie jars I loved, you can order cookies for the table, you can open it and their eyes just light up, you\u2019re like a kid again.</p> <h2><strong>Daniel Burns</strong></h2> <p><em>Former pastry chef, Noma and The Fat Duck; chef and co-owner Luksus in New York City</em></p> <p>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was pretty crucial to my childhood.

The people he empowered and the structures he put in place mean the menace of Isis will continue without him.</p> <p>Since 2014, Adnani had been the voice who galvanised so-called lone wolves to launch attacks. He had also overseen the deployment of some of the group\u2019s most lethally trained operatives, many of whom have been sent to Europe to wait for instructions to launch more co-ordinated missions, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/20/brussels-bombings-osama-krayem-suspect-charged-role-paris-attacks\">those that struck Paris and Brussels</a>.</p> <p>Global savagery had become Adnani\u2019s calling card. Operating with more autonomy than most other leaders, he had ensured the group could still make its mark even as the territory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/11/islamic-state-has-lost-grip-on-12-of-territory-in-six-months-study\">it held shrank rapidly</a>.</p> <p>The foreign operations file was given to him by the Isis leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/06/mosul-video-purports-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-islamic-state\">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a>, in as early as 2014. By then he was already the group\u2019s leader in Syria, one of two centres of gravity for Isis, the other being Mosul in Iraq.</p> <p>The heady early months of Isis\u2019s rise kept Adnani focused on consolidating gains in Syria until mid-2015, by which time land it held in both countries was being steadily stripped from its control. Population groups had started to flee en masse, many leaving for Europe on the migrant route, and out of chaos, Isis, led by Adnani and Baghdadi, sensed opportunity.</p> <p>Adnani, as well as another senior Iraqi member of the group, was responsible for smuggling militants disguised as refugees to Europe. Intelligence services in the UK, France, Germany and elsewhere believe the number of operatives to be at least 200. The fraught job of tracking the whereabouts of militants who left their home countries for Iraq and Syria has left European spies fearing the actual number may be substantially higher.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f7c8375cf7b6dbaca08c7b43db675cf755cb948\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f7c8375cf7b6dbaca08c7b43db675cf755cb948/48_408_2918_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iraqi fighter during clashes with Isis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Iraqi Shia fighter fires artillery during clashes with Isis State militants near Falluja, Iraq.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since late last year, Adnani had spent much of his time plotting attacks abroad.

A large part of Isis\u2019s appeal, even among communities that do not share its implacable take on Islam, is that it offers support in the absence of any other organised system.</p> <p>Adnani was one of the last last leftovers of the original alumni that had adopted a de facto role as protector of the region\u2019s Sunni Muslims. He was among the few surviving leaders with personal links to the group\u2019s founder, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jun/09/guardianobituaries.alqaida\">Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a>, who moulded the most ruthless group of modern times from the resentment that steamed from the ousting of Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>Military men who had lost all when the Iraqi dictator fell were central to all subsequent incarnations of Isis.

The pledge is a staple of his campaign rallies, at which he frequently asks the crowd: \u201cWho is going to pay for the wall?\u201d The response is loudly shouted: \u201cMexico.\u201d<br></p> <p>Within minutes of announcing his presidential campaign in June 2015, Trump claimed that the Mexican government was deliberately sending criminals and rapists across the border to the United States. The Republican nominee has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/487316463204986880\">tweeted</a> that Mexico is an \u201cenemy\u201d of the United States and that the country is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/570384640281870337?lang=en\">\u201ccorrupt.\u201d</a> Despite all this, he has long maintained: \u201cI love the Mexican people.\u201d</p> <p>The trip is only Trump\u2019s second visit abroad as a candidate. Although presidential candidates often travel overseas to boost their foreign policy credentials, Trump has kept almost entirely to the United States. The only exception was his June trip to Scotland for the opening of his golf course there. Then, Trump held <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-hails-eu-referendum-result-as-he-arrives-in-uk\">a self-congratulatory press conference</a> only hours after the UK had voted to leave the EU, at which the Republican nominee praised himself for correctly predicting the result. </p> <p>Unlike his trip to Scotland, Trump\u2019s visit to Mexico is intended to promote his campaign, not his personal business interests. It underscores the messaging in Trump\u2019s immigration speech scheduled for Wednesday night in Phoenix, Arizona. There, the Republican nominee is expected to try to strike a balance between the hardline rhetoric he used throughout the Republican primary and the need to deflect charges of racism in order to win a general election in November. </p> <p>The Republican nominee has struggled in the past two weeks to clarify his position on immigration, specifically whether he is undergoing \u201ca softening\u201d on his past call for the deportation of all 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. Trump, who previously backed \u201ca deportation force,\u201d seemingly endorsed a path to legal status for undocumented immigrations and then reversed himself in the past week. The resulting lack of clarity forced prominent rightwing talkshow host Rush Limbaugh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/30/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-hacking-threat-election-live?page=with:block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69#block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69\">to admit to</a> his audience on Monday: \u201cI never took him seriously\u201d on immigration.</p> <p>In a statement, Tana Goertz, a former contestant on Trump\u2019s television show The Apprentice and senior advisor to his campaign, insisted that Trump would stay tough on immigration in his speech on Wednesday. </p> <p>\u201cThroughout his presidential campaign, Donald J Trump has been consistent in his calls to end illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border. He is the only candidate in this race who will stop illegal immigration, secure our border, end sanctuary cities, enforce our existing laws and stop American employers from hiring illegal workers,\u201d she said. \u201cThese reforms will not only put an end to our illegal immigration epidemic \u2014 they will promote safe communities and good-paying jobs that will make America great again.\u201d</p> <p>The move on immigration follows rhetorical attempts to reach out to African American voters following a shakeup of his campaign team and the hiring of pollster Kellyanne Conway as his campaign manager and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">Steve Bannon, former executive chairman of rightwing website Breitbart</a>, as his campaign CEO. </p> <p>Trump is not the only presidential candidate who has received an invitation from Pe\u00f1a Nieto. In a statement from senior campaign official, the Clinton campaign told the Guardian: \u201cWe have received a letter from President Pe\u00f1a Nieto requesting an opportunity to meet. Secretary Clinton last met with President Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico in 2014 and our campaign is in a regular dialogue with the Mexican government officials. She looks forward to talking with President Pe\u00f1a Nieto again at the appropriate time.\u201d</p> <p>Trump reportedly went to Mexico accompanied by two close advisers, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and Senator Jeff Sessions from Alabama. However, the Republican nominee was not accompanied by his traveling press corps, who have been stranded in the United States in an unprecedented step. The Trump campaign has been historically combative towards the press and refused to credential a number of outlets for his events, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/donald-trump-media-ban-guardian-denied-entry-campaign-event\">the Guardian in one instance</a>, on his trip to Scotland. </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/samjones\">Sam Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-agren\">David Agren</a> in Villahermosa, Mexico</em></p>",

We're not buying it | Barrett Holmes Pitner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>White supremacist groups rose in the civil war\u2019s aftermath, organized by southern white people determined to use violence to deny Reconstruction-era promotion of black citizenship. The Ku Klux Klan is the most famous of these groups, whose numbers steadily increased at the end of the 19th century. By the early 20th century the Klan\u2019s worldview helped shape the racial nativism \u2013 marked by anti-immigrant fervor, antisemitism and anti-Catholicism \u2013 that gripped the nation.</p> <p>The Klan practically joined the American mainstream during the 1920s, proudly marching by the tens of thousands in the nation\u2019s capital, their very presence giving weight to the pseudo-science of eugenics being popularized at the time.</p> <p>Fewer white hate groups dotted America\u2019s political landscape after the second world war, the result of both the success of racial segregation and the pushback from anti-racist groups during WWII\u2019s freedom surge. The 1954 Brown v Board of Ed supreme court desegregation decision resurrected these groups with a vengeance, one of the most notable being the White Citizens Councils opposing public school integration that gained traction throughout the south.</p> <p>By the late 1960s, the political energies of hate groups reached their apex in the candidacy of former Alabama governor George Wallace, who received nearly 10m popular votes as a segregationist candidate for president in 1968. And the Republican party\u2019s now infamous \u201csouthern strategy\u201d further cultivated disgruntled white voters, sometimes called \u201cDixiecrats\u201d, with naked appeals to racism.</p> <p>Donald Trump, the inheritor of this complex history, is playing a most dangerous game. His calls to \u201cmake America great again\u201d \u2013 which many view as thinly veiled code for white nationalism \u2013 has inspired millions of disgruntled and economically insecure white people, unleashing barely controlled furies that have roiled and embarrassed the nation. <br></p> <p>White Lives Matter proponents gained national attention when they <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/houston/article/White-Lives-Matter-group-protests-outside-NAACP-9176142.php\">staged a protest</a> outside of NAACP offices in Houston that prominently featured the Confederate flag. An outgrowth of a social media meme that spread among white people in the aftermath of Black Lives Matter protests, the group traffics in the fiction that white Americans are under assault from an onslaught of illegal immigration, reverse racism and political correctness. </p> <p>With ties to the white nationalist Aryan Front Coalition and a self-described mission to preserve the white race, White Lives Matter joins the Southern Poverty law Center\u2019s list of 892 active hate groups in the US. America\u2019s racial Pandora\u2019s box, once thought to have been closed by Obama\u2019s watershed presidential election, has been reopened with a vengeance.</p> <p>As our third consecutive summer of racial discontent comes to an end, white and black Americans remain <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/27/key-takeaways-race-and-inequality/\">split</a> over what might be called our collective racial reality. Blacks are more likely than whites to perceive racial discrimination, advocate for substantive policy changes, document unfair treatment by the criminal justice system and other institutions and to support Black Lives Matter.</p> <p>Yet these differences merely scratch the surface of the pernicious effect of groups such as White Lives Matter. Buoyed by Trump\u2019s campaign and the capitulation of mainstream Republicans, groups like White Lives Matter have helped anti-black racism to once again be normalized. And its activists form the latest beachhead in the racial archipelago that contours a nation that twice voted overwhelmingly to elect a black president.</p> <p>The devastating takeaway from allegations of reverse racism, the promotion of the Confederate flag and the demonization of Black Lives Matter is the surreal picture by many aggrieved whites that they are the most discriminated-against group in America. </p> <p>Even as social economic indicators reveal the exact opposite, the racial grievances and resentment emanating from such hate groups have successfully captured the imagination of a sizeable portion of the American electorate. White Lives Matter\u2019s designation as a hate group confirms what we already knew about not just one organization, but the iconic demagogue who has breathed life into racial furies that we recently thought were facing extinction. </p>",

The visit is also a timely distraction from embarrassing reports, which have dominated recent headlines, that he <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree\">plagiarized</a> his law degree thesis. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>This week\u2019s bad press, which includes the <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20160830-mexico-federal-police-chief-sacked-drug-cartel-executions-michuacan\">sacking</a> of Mexico\u2019s police commissioner following allegations of cartel executions, follows months of looming scandals plaguing his own administration. These include large teacher strikes, allegations of the use of torture on ordinary citizens and most recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/mexico-first-lady-florida-property-government-contractor-documents-reveal\">reports</a> that the Mexican first lady\u2019s home is owned by a potential government contractor. All of the above have sent Mexican confidence in its president plunging.</p> <p>The embarrassing thing is that we can actually see Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s logic at work in real time as this disaster unfolds. The president thinks that he will see the bad man, appear stern to the bad man, tell everyone that he was indeed stern to the bad man and then his poll numbers will rise. Easy. There\u2019s only one problem with this plan. Trump may well hijack that narrative, frame the meeting to his advantage and then straight-up lie about the details in Arizona with a straight face. </p> <p>Pe\u00f1a Nieto, with his credibility already weakened internationally, would be easy prey. His name is almost synonymous with the brand of poor Mexican governance that Trump rails against in his anti-immigrant tirades all over the country. And even if Pe\u00f1a Nieto does a good job in standing tall to Trump\u2019s xenophobic, anti-Nafta, pro-wall rhetoric, the president risks everything should the Republican candidate choose to exploit his numerous political weaknesses. That would not just be damaging to him, but to Mexico\u2019s international reputation at large. </p> <p>That\u2019s why many fear this gamble can only go well for Trump. And if this meeting teaches us anything it\u2019s that Pe\u00f1a Nieto is willing to risk Mexican ire and possible geopolitical consequences if only to save his own political career. </p>",

We were in a playground last weekend and I half jokingly, half not-jokingly, said to her: \u2018Can we speak Hungarian here?\u2019 We\u2019ve been to that playground loads of times. But there\u2019s \u2026 a heightened sensitivity which is reflected in the reporting of the crime statistics. There is more hate crime now, and there\u2019s more reporting of it too, because people are tuned into it.\u201d And alongside the visible \u201cother\u201d of race, there is now the audible \u201cother\u201d of language.</p> <p>Kuba Jablonowski, who came to Britain from Poland a decade ago, was reluctant to leave his house in Bristol after the vote. He worried the country he had come to love was a mirage, and that he would now have to face a reality he had not reckoned on. \u201cI went to my local Polish shop and they said they had three people come in and report racial abuse and ask what should they do. They said it was absolutely unprecedented. And the guy there said that when he was going down the street to work he was looking at people and thinking: \u2018Was it you who voted out? Was it you who voted out? Was it you who voted out ...\u2019 Everything changed and nothing changed, all at the same time; it is all about perceptions.\u201d</p> <p>In this climate, it\u2019s not surprising that many eastern Europeans have started to ask themselves if they want to stay here. But another question mark hangs over whether or not they will even be allowed to. When running for the Conservative party leadership, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/03/theresa-may-eu-migrants-pawn-brexit-talks-tory-leadership-race\">Theresa May would not guarantee the rights of EU citizens</a> to remain in Britain post-Brexit. On a recent trip to Slovakia and Poland, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/27/theresa-may-eu-citizens-rights-britons-abroad\">May suggested this right to remain will hinge on whether British citizens have reciprocal rights</a> in their countries. There is no official position. But there are human consequences. And so, for all EU citizens in Britain, anxiety about their future fills the void. \u201cI\u2019m redecorating my kitchen at the moment,\u201d says Kinga Goodwin, a Polish-born academic who lives in London. \u201cAnd every now and then, even though I\u2019m married to an Englishman, I keep asking myself if it makes sense.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3eb5434fc5cb7cddff3bcc5bef2c02b16478496\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3eb5434fc5cb7cddff3bcc5bef2c02b16478496/0_11_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Messages of support left at the Village Shop in Norwich.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Messages of support left at the Village Shop in Norwich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At an eastern European women\u2019s group meeting at the Wellspring Healthy Living Centre in Bristol\u2019s Barton Hill, Anja tells me that her daughter, who had planned to put down roots here, is having second thoughts. \u201cShe was hoping to buy a house with her fiance but the day after Brexit, he was approached on the street by a British person saying it was time for him to go back to Poland. The next day they were supposed to be going to see a house they planned to buy, but they cancelled the visit ... they don\u2019t know what to do because of the Brexit situation.\u201d</p> <p>In Sunderland, the referendum result was less of a shock. Daniel Krzyszczak, a manager at the International Community Organisation of Sunderland, which works mostly but not exclusively with eastern Europeans, notes the rise of Ukip over the past few years, and points out that anti-immigrant sentiment simply intensified following the Brexit campaign. One factory worker, who would not give his name, shows me a poster that was put up in his changing room a couple of days before the referendum, stating: \u201cVote out EU, come on England, get the cunts out.\u201d</p> <p>Brexit didn\u2019t introduce xenophobia or racism to Britain, but it has complicated our understanding of both. Like immigrants from former colonies after the second world war, the east European migrants thought they were coming for a short time, stayed longer, did work others wouldn\u2019t and started families. There is also much in the nature of the hostility that chimes with previous scripts. In keeping with the tropes of prejudice and bigotry, they have been depicted simultaneously as welfare scroungers and as workers who \u201csteal\u201d jobs from local people and refuse to integrate.</p> <p>This is not the first time white people in Britain have been racialised on account of their distinct religious, national or cultural affinities. Jews, Catholics, the Irish and Gypsies have all been, and can still be, discriminated against because of who they are.</p> <p>In the wake of the Brexit vote the distinction between racism and xenophobia blurred. \u201cIt\u2019s not just eastern Europeans facing the abuse,\u201d explains Raikes. \u201cI had a dual-heritage family with a mum and her 11-month-old baby going past the pub the day after the referendum and a load of guys shouted at them and said: \u2018Now we\u2019re leaving the EU, go back to where you came from,\u2019 and spat on them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e91638a2a4f9a7390c16314a9d6e27f78fe4ddaf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e91638a2a4f9a7390c16314a9d6e27f78fe4ddaf/0_1_548_329/500.jpg\" alt=\"CCTV footage of the night of the arson attack on The Village Shop in Norwich.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">CCTV footage of the night of the arson attack on The Village Shop in Norwich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Submitted/Archant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And if bigots weren\u2019t making the distinction, neither black Britons nor eastern Europeans were necessarily seeing the commonalities between their experiences either. Examples of Black and Asian voters complaining about eastern European immigrants in the runup to the referendum were legion. And one of the reasons why so many eastern Europeans were shocked by the response post-Brexit is because they thought racism didn\u2019t apply to them.</p> <p>\u201cEuropean groups who live here don\u2019t necessarily see race equality organisations as representing them,\u201d says Omar Khan, director of race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust. \u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily frame their experiences as racism. Often they think they\u2019re white and Christian and so are British people and aren\u2019t we all European. I think also we have to be frank in saying there are real tensions between these groups sometimes. Black British groups can feel that, compared with when they came over, Europeans have better access to benefits; they may also feel that eastern Europeans are more racist than white British people. Obviously, to the extent that they feel that way, it\u2019s a barrier to working together to eliminate discrimination.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most egregious attacks in Newcastle was against a young black Polish woman who was harassed on a bus. When she got on, a youngster shouted: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a monkey on a bus.\u201d Then they started talking about Europe. \u201cSomething about stealing jobs and things like this,\u201d the woman says.</p> <p>Then she started talking to her friend in Polish. The boys carried on shouting. When she ignored them, one of them set her hair on fire.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think that was about you being black or Polish?\u201d I ask her.</p> <p>\u201cHow would I know?\u201d she shrugs.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Gary Younge\u2019s</em> <em>Eastern Europeans in Brexitland is broadcast on 5 and 12 September at 8pm on BBC Radio 4.

  "<p>When you put tequila and cars side-by-side, the story doesn\u2019t usually end well. But Ford is trying to change the narrative.</p> <p>The car manufacturer has plans to introduce a new kind of plastic for some of its automobile parts using waste material generated by Jose Cuervo, the tequila manufacturer. Tequila is made by juicing the heart of an agave plant, a spiky desert succulent with a core composed of very strong fibers. These fibers are left over during the juicing process, and are usually thrown away or burned.</p> <p>Now, Ford hopes to use these agave fibers to create a so-called bioplastic to replace synthetic materials, such as fiberglass, which are used to strengthen plastic components in cars \u2013 things such as storage bins, air-conditioning ducts and fuse boxes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/25/wool-shoes-green-footwear-ugg-allbirds-glerups\">Would you wear wool shoes to save the environment?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bioplastics are an old class of materials, invented after <a href=\"http://cell.sites.acs.org/anselmepayenaward.htm\">Anselme Payen</a>, a French chemist, discovered cellulose in 1838 \u2013 a compound in many plants that can be made into fibers. By the late 1800s, cellulose from plants was being used to make rayon and viscose fabrics, as well as cellulose acetate photographic film, or safety film, designed to replace highly flammable nitrate film. Carmaker Henry Ford became an early champion, developing soybean-based plastic auto parts in the 1940s.</p> <p>Ford began using a soy-based foam in seat cushions for the Mustang coupe in 2001, a material produced from crop waste on soybean fields in the Midwest. It is now used in every vehicle Ford makes in North America, and has also been adopted by the mattress industry.</p> <p>Later, in 2010, the car manufacturer looked at using plastics produced with wheat straw in the Flex SUV, which is manufactured in Ontario, Canada. The straw was previously burned by Canadian farmers because the climate was too cold to compost it. It was adopted as a reinforcing material in automobile plastics to replace talc, which must be mined.</p> <p>Agave fibers will serve the same purpose in a new hybrid plastic. The fibers are extremely strong and resilient, and have been used for centuries by indigenous people in both the US and Mexico for sewing and weaving, and for making rope.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of companies around the world that are looking at agave fibers,\u201d says <a href=\"http://dgrewell.public.iastate.edu/\">David Grewell</a>, an associate professor at Iowa State University and also director of the <a href=\"http://www.cb2.iastate.edu/index.html\">Center for Bioplastics and Biocomposites</a>, a National Science Foundation research center.</p> <p>\u201cThe fibers themselves are relatively flexible, so that when they go through processing equipment, they are able to retain their strength. They don\u2019t break and they\u2019re relatively tough. Unlike glass fibers, which tend to be relatively brittle and not able to absorb energy.\u201d</p> <p>Ford hopes to begin using the new bioplastic made from agave at its factory in Hermosillo, Mexico, where it builds the Fusion and Lincoln MKZ sedans, within a year or two.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb3244ac0a9c92cb7e98faa6f5c40d369d0907f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb3244ac0a9c92cb7e98faa6f5c40d369d0907f0/52_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Agave fibers are put into a processing machine at a Ford lab.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Agave fibers are put into a processing machine at a Ford lab.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of the farm-to-table movement in food,\u201d says Debbie Mielewski, Ford\u2019s senior technical leader of sustainable products. \u201cThis is sort of the same kind of thinking, where you would look at the local farms and see what kind of things could be incorporated into our products. We call it farm-to-car.\u201d</p> <p>Bioplastics may sound natural, but there is some controversy about how they break down. Many people make the assumption that because bioplastics contain natural materials, they must also be recyclable or compostable \u2013 or both. Whether either of these is possible generally depends upon what makes up the plastic substitute in the final material.</p> <p>Frederick Michel, <a href=\"http://fic.osu.edu/members/directory/m/michel-frederick.html\">an associate professor of food, agriculture and biological engineering at Ohio State University</a>, notes that despite robust recycling programs in the US, most plastics still end up as garbage in a landfill. So a new product\u2019s fate in that environment is important to consider. Michel says Ford\u2019s new material can\u2019t be considered a true bioplastic, because the agave fibers are merely a strengthening filler mixed with a petroleum based plastic, not one derived from natural materials.</p> <p>\u201cIf [bioplastics] are made from carbon from the atmosphere, and do not degrade in the landfill, then they can sequester atmospheric carbon and reduce global warming,\u201d Michel says. \u201cIf they do biodegrade in the landfill, they form methane, which is a greenhouse gas 20-30 times worse than carbon dioxide. So it depends.\u201d</p> <p>One example of a petroleum based bioplastic is the <a href=\"http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/plantbottle-frequently-asked-questions\">PlantBottle</a> developed by Coca-Cola in 2009. Some 30% of the material comes from sugar cane, the remaining 70% is petroleum derived. The company has been gradually phasing in the use of this material, and expects all its plastic bottles to use it by 2020.</p> <p>Ford has collaborated with Coca-Cola in the past to use PlantBottle material on a <a href=\"http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/driving-innovation-coca-cola-and-ford-take-plantbottle-technology-beyond-packaging\">trial basis</a> in seat fabrics.</p> <p>Mielewski says Ford\u2019s tests with the agave bioplastic have switched 30% of the strengthening material in the bioplastic to agave fibers, while the rest remains either fiberglass or talc. The balance of the material is a petroleum-derived plastic.</p> <p>She said the company has not yet found a bioplastic that lasts long enough in car parts. Most biodegrade too quickly, yielding a shorter lifespan than the car itself.</p> <p>\u201cThe advantage with switching out fiberglass with agave is the agave is more recyclable,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fiber doesn\u2019t break when remolding, so there is potential there to reuse it in the same product.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/06/eating-insects-food-grubbly-farms-sustainable-seafood-startups\">Let them eat bugs: US startup sees future of sustainable food in creepy crawlies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Possibly the most direct advantage, Mielewski says, is improved fuel efficiency. A typical car totes around some 400lbs of plastic, she says. Plastics made with plants tend to be about 20% lighter, potentially cutting 80-100lbs off a car\u2019s weight. That\u2019s enough, she says, to produce a measurable drop in fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>Across the 2.6m vehicles sold by Ford in 2015, this has the potential to significantly reduce the company\u2019s carbon emissions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/experts/darby-hoover\">Darby Hoover</a>, a senior resource specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, praised Ford for focusing on agricultural waste, rather than virgin materials. There are 5bn metric tons of agricultural waste produced globally every year, Hoover says, so reusing more of this is important to the planet. It is also preferable to growing a plant specifically to make plastic, which takes land and other resources out of food production.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely true that you\u2019re avoiding impacts that likely would happen if that agave waste were not repurposed,\u201d Hoover says. \u201cAll of that would create near term carbon emissions.

  "<p>The early calls for Britain to go quickly have ceased, and despite the insistence on \u201cno negotiation without notification\u201d, informal talks between UK officials and their counterparts in EU capitals are under way. </p> <p>But as the government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/no-staying-in-eu-by-back-door-theresa-may-brexit\">begins working out</a> what form it would like Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU to take (and when it would like it to start), it seems probable that what it eventually decides it might like will not be what it gets. </p> <p>In contrast to the first few days after the 23 June referendum, when European leaders were queuing up to say Britain must launch the two-year exit process as soon as possible, most see the point of showing some patience. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/aug/31/corbyn-labour-leadership-yougov-poll-leadership-with-increased-majority-poll-suggests-politics-live\">Cabinet signals controlling migration to take precedence over single market access in Brexit talks - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel reiterated during talks with Estonia\u2019s prime minister in Tallinn last week that it made no sense to push Britain for progress until it knew what it wanted, and added that in the meantime the remaining 27 members had enough to do rebooting the European project without Britain.</p> <p>\u201cAs long as Britain hasn\u2019t submitted its application, we cannot say what kind of relationship with it we envision,\u201d Merkel said. The EU 27 could and should \u201callow the UK the time it takes to work out what relationship it wants with the EU\u201d.</p> <p>Nor would Brexit dominate the EU summit in Bratislava \u2013 to which Britain has not been invited \u2013 on 16 September, Merkel said. \u201cWe have to think about what our own priorities are, how we want to continue our work and where we want to make an effort in particular. This is the purpose in Bratislava.\u201d </p> <p>Later, meeting leaders from Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary in Warsaw, she stressed again that Brexit was \u201ca turning point in the history of European integration. Citizens will only accept the EU if it allows them to prosper. We need to do a lot more.\u201d</p> <p>But the bloc\u2019s overriding focus on its post-Brexit future does not mean Britain can expect an easy ride when negotiations do finally start. EU leaders may be showing patience for the time being, but they have their own red lines, and a timetable.</p> <p>There is now a clear expectation in European capitals that article 50 will be triggered in the first half of next year. France\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/22/beginning-new-europe-merkel-renzi-hollande\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande</a> said in Paris on Monday that Theresa May had tough decisions to take and needed time, but she could not wait long. \u201cIt would neither be good for Britain, nor acceptable for Europe. For France, everything must be concluded by 2019,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hollande reiterated the European position on any future EU-UK trade relationship, which has not budged since June. The UK \u201cwill not be able to access the single market\u201d, he said, \u201cunless its accepts the four freedoms, all its regulations, and budgetary solidarity\u201d.</p> <p>There is, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/restricting-immigration-will-be-at-heart-of-brexit-deal-theresa-may-says\">it was announced after the Brexit awayday</a> at the Chequers country retreat on Wednesday, \u201cstrong agreement\u201d in the cabinet that EU immigration must be controlled: if Brexit means anything, that, it seems, is what it must mean. But ministers were also at pains to stress the need for a \u201cpositive outcome\u201d for trading goods and services. </p> <p>It will be a difficult circle to square. Germany\u2019s economy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, was one among many to make that very plain last week, saying Britain could not be allowed to have its single market cake and eat it.</p> <p>Brexit was \u201ca huge problem politically\u201d, Gabriel said. \u201cIf we organise it in the wrong way <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/29/uk-must-pay-for-brexit-or-eu-is-in-deep-trouble-says-german-minister\">we\u2019ll be in deep trouble</a>, so we need to make sure we don\u2019t allow Britain to keep the nice things related to Europe, so to speak, while taking no responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>Facing its own problems, including a far-from-resolved migration crisis, Europe is divided along multiple faultlines, with tensions between north and south, east and west, old and new member states, left- and rightwing governments, creditor and debtor nations. </p> <p>The EU 27 do not share a vision of how to move forwards: some favour a tighter, more integrated EU, others a looser \u201cvariable geometry\u201d; some want more investment to kickstart flagging economies, others greater competitiveness and tougher fiscal discipline.</p> <p>But with Eurosceptic parties such as the Front National, Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, the Netherlands\u2019 PVV and Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement on the rise, and difficult French, German and Dutch elections next year (plus a critical referendum in Italy this October), they do share similar domestic political pressures. </p> <p>If anything, Europe\u2019s negotiating position can be expected to stiffen over the coming months. A \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d deal for Britain \u2013 keeping access to the single market, while winning concessions on free movement \u2013 would play straight into the Eurosceptics\u2019 hands and risk fatally weakening the EU. <br></p> <p>Whatever deal the British government eventually opts for, the one it actually gets will depend at least as much on member states\u2019 domestic politics, and on what they agree must be done to revive the European project, than on the wishlist the government has begun drawing up at Chequers. </p>",

The spokesperson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister chaired political cabinet at Chequers this afternoon.</p> <p>The meeting began with a discussion led by Patrick McLoughlin. He spoke about the strength of the Conservative party, with membership growing by almost 50,000 over the summer. Looking ahead to conference he announced the largest attendance in over a decade and that the theme would be \u201cA country that works for everyone\u201d. The prime minister added this reflected the fact that we are a united party and a united government, getting on with the job of delivering on the issues that British people care about. This was contrasted with the inward looking and divided opposition.</p> <p>It was agreed that the opening day of conference would be about global Britain - showing that we are more outward looking than ever before. In a discussion about Brexit the PM said that there were two related imperatives: getting the best deal for people at home, and getting the right deal for Britain abroad.</p> <p>There was a strong emphasis on pushing ahead to article 50 to lead Britain successfully out of the European Union - with no need for a parliamentary vote.</p> <p>Furthermore, several cabinet members made it clear that we are leaving the EU but not leaving Europe, with a decisive view that the model we are seeking is one unique to the United Kingdom and not an off the shelf solution. This must mean controls on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe but also a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services.</p> <p>On the agenda and discussed at length was the commitment to the devolved nations to make sure that Brexit works for all - but cabinet members were clear that it is the United Kingdom\u2019s government\u2019s decision to establish its terms and on when to trigger article 50.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The cabinet has agreed that getting a Brexit deal that will allow the UK to control immigration will take precedence over getting a deal that gives full access to the single market.</strong> That is the implication of the statement that the deal \u201cmust mean controls on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe but also a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services.\u201d The word \u201ccontrols\u201d is specific; the phrase \u201cpositive outcome\u201d is vague, and could mean very little.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>MPs will not get a vote on the decision to invoke article 50, triggering the formal two-year EU withdrawal process, the cabinet has confirmed.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be consulted over Brexit, but will not get a veto, the cabinet has confirmed.</strong></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01031b4f94d43a585fce05decca7af8c85eeb354\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01031b4f94d43a585fce05decca7af8c85eeb354/0_63_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May addressing cabinet at Chequers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May addressing cabinet at Chequers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T16:26:42.111Z\">at 5.26pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c6f66de4b0f6cb85628ace\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T15:25:56.972Z\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I\u2019m told there was more said about Brexit at the political cabinet.

This is from the prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister chaired cabinet at Chequers this morning. After the usual update from the Leaders of the Commons and the Lords on parliamentary business, the discussion moved on to the economy.</p> <p>The chancellor provided cabinet colleagues with an update on the economic outlook. The cabinet reiterated the government\u2019s commitment to fiscal discipline and living within our means. Ministers agreed that we should be seizing the opportunity of Brexit to confirm the UK\u2019s place as one of the great trading nations in the world, fostering entrepreneurialism and setting out a long term vision for the country. They also agreed on the vital need to increase productivity and the importance of doing more to foster economic growth and industrial development in regions up and down the country.<br></p> <p>The foreign secretary then provided an update on the campaign to defeat Daesh in Syria, Iraq and Libya and the UK\u2019s role in supporting political progress in all three countries. The foreign secretary highlighted the progress that had been made in squeezing the territory held by Daesh, with 40% reclaimed, as well as a fall in support for Daesh\u2019s ideology around the world. The cabinet agreed that Islamist terrorism continues to be one of the greatest security threats we face and therefore we must continue to work closely with our allies to defeat Daesh and to support strong, stable governance in countries around the world, particularly in countries where terrorists are trying to establish safe havens.<br></p> <p>Conversations continued after lunch during a meeting of the political cabinet.</p> </blockquote> <p>This morning, in her opening remarks, Theresa May said cabinet would discuss \u201cthe next steps\u201d to be taken in relation to Brexit. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/aug/31/corbyn-labour-leadership-yougov-poll-leadership-with-increased-majority-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57c6acf5e4b0f6cb8562899d#block-57c6acf5e4b0f6cb8562899d\"> 11.26am.)</a> But this statement says very little about this, beyond saying the government wants Britain to remain \u201cone of the great trading nations in the world\u201d. At this stage (I have not had any further briefing yet) it is not clear whether that is because ministers did not agree anything meaningful on the next stage of Brexit, or whether they did but are just choosing to keep it all secret. May says \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d but that\u2019s just circular logic. As for what it really means, that remains as much of a mystery as ever.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T15:18:57.192Z\">at 4.18pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c6ee01e4b04fe839bc5292\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T15:03:52.600Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Corbyn proposes 'gender audit' of Labour policies</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At an event at Unison HQ later this afternoon <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> will be announcing proposals to benefit women. His team have just emailed out the details. </p> <p>His plans include having a regular \u201cgender audit\u201d of Labour policies, setting up a new women\u2019s advisory board to advise the leader and toughening the law (in a manner so far unspecified) on online harrassment.</p> <p>Here are the key announcements from the news release.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> <strong>Increasing women\u2019s representation in our society, democracy and party</strong> by supporting all women shortlists to achieve 50:50 representation in parliament and the same aim for all public offices; supporting a policy-making annual Labour women\u2019s conference; publishing a regular \u2018gender audit\u2019 of Labour policies; and consult on establishing a high level, strategic women\u2019s advisory board linked to the leader\u2019s office to ensure women are at the heart of our policies, and to support the shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, along with advisory boards on other equality strands.</p> <p><strong>Investing in an economy that delivers for women. </strong>Austerity isn\u2019t working and has disproportionately harmed women. Our public investment strategy will provide a foundation for the economy to grow, and from which to properly fund and democratise our public services and end the cuts that women, as the majority of public service users and workforce, have borne the brunt of. Labour will ensure increased recruitment of women into science, technology, engineering and manufacturing occupations and will tackle occupational segregation in our economy. Labour will also give enhanced powers to the Equality and Human Rights Commission to penalise companies that do not publish detailed gender pay data at a company-wide level as part of tackling equal pay issues.</p> <p><strong>Tackling sexual harassment and threats online</strong> through a wide-ranging consultation exercise on how to strengthen the law and its implementation and increase organisations\u2019 responsibility towards promoting safe and respectful \u2018community standards\u2019 online. Within the party we will take forward the recommendations of the Shami Chakrabarti Inquiry to consult on and introduce a wider equal opportunities policy, training and guidance for members and staff, recognising that online abuse is often also racist and homophobic in nature as well as misogynistic.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some of these proposals (for example, on equal pay audits) are similar or identical to what Corbyn proposed in his <a href=\"https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/jeremyforlabour/pages/87/attachments/original/1438076296/WorkingWithWomen.pdf?1438076296\">Working with Women policy paper (pdf)</a> in last year\u2019s leadership contest, but in some respects Corbyn is now going further.

The single market is the engine room of EU regulation; it\u2019s the requirement for free movement of people that comes with it that has put people off the European Union, and so I think any effort to keep us within the single market is basically rejecting the referendum result.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also dismissed claims that the government would have difficulty deciding Brexit policy because the three leading Brexit ministers - Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, and Liam Fox, the international trade secretary - do not get on. It would be fine, he suggested, because they were all \u201caffable personalities\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They\u2019re three strong but enormously affable personalities.

The main point of interest is Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who is sitting at May\u2019s right and who starts off nodding judiciously at her words, before staring into the distance towards the end as if he\u2019s getting bored. You can also just about hear him come out with a half-hearted cheer (more like a \u2018yurggh\u2019) as May says there must be no attempts to stay in the EU by the back door <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/28/boris-johnson-eu-referendum-double-strategy-vote\">(even though this was a strategy Johnson himself seemed to be backing last year.)</a></p> <p>May seemed to be speaking off the cuff, rather than from notes.

It\u2019s our first opportunity to meet since the summer recess, but also the first opportunity for us to meet since the fantastic success of the GB Team at the Olympics \u2013 absolutely great. And also the Paralympics will be starting very soon, so we wish our Paralympic athletes all the very best and success there as well.</p> <p>But obviously over the summer \u2013 over the last few weeks \u2013 quite a lot of work has been done. We\u2019re going to be having an opportunity today to discuss this. We will have an update on Brexit; we\u2019ll be looking at the next steps that we need to take, and we\u2019ll also be looking at the opportunities that are now open to us as we forge a new role for the UK in the world. We must continue to be very clear that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, that we\u2019re going to make a success of it. That means there\u2019s no second referendum; no attempts to sort of stay in the EU by the back door; that we\u2019re actually going to deliver on this.</p> <p>We\u2019re also going to talk this morning about social reform. We want to be a government and a country that works for everyone, and we\u2019ll be talking about some of the steps that we need to take in order to build that society that works for everyone. And I want it to be a society where it\u2019s the talent that you have and how hard you\u2019re prepared to work that determines how you get on, rather than your background.</p> <p>We\u2019ll be having an update on the state of the economy. We\u2019ll be looking at how we can work to increase productivity \u2013 that\u2019s one of the key issues that we want to address. But also how we can get tough on irresponsible behaviour in big business \u2013 again making sure that actually everyone is able to share in the country\u2019s prosperity.</p> <p>We will be looking at the legislative programme that we have coming up in parliament. And we\u2019ll also be hearing a political update from the party chairman, particularly as we look forward to our party conference.</p> <p>So quite a packed agenda for our meeting today. But can I just remind everybody that this really is a very significant moment for the country, as we look ahead to the next steps that we need to take. We have the opportunity to forge a new positive role for the UK in the world; to make sure that we are that government and country that works for everyone \u2013 that everyone can share in the country\u2019s prosperity. So there are challenges ahead but it\u2019s an important and significant moment for us and I think we have real opportunities to develop the United Kingdom and ensure that it does work for everyone in the UK.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c69c2fe4b0f6cb85628973\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T10:04:14.395Z\">11.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">YouGov's Labour leadership poll - 10 findings from the small print</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As promised, here is more from the detail of the YouGov poll. I posted the key findings at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/aug/31/corbyn-labour-leadership-yougov-poll-leadership-with-increased-majority-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57c685f6e4b0f6cb85628930#block-57c685f6e4b0f6cb85628930\">9.02am</a>. Here are 10 more findings from the survey.</p> <p><strong>1 - Corbyn\u2019s key strength is that he is seen as \u201cprincipled\u201d.</strong> Some 76% of the Labour selectorate said they saw him this way. He also scored well for honesty (64%) and for \u201cshares my political outlook\u201d 58%. But only 33% of the Labour selectorate as a whole said he was likely to lead the party to victory at the election, and only 35% said he was competent. This is from the New Statesman\u2019s<strong> Stephen Bush.</strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/stephenkb/status/770741279336570880\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hard to sustain from these numbers that Labour members are &quot;mad&quot; or in denial about Corbyn&#39;s failings. <a href=\"https://t.co/iVBpT8K48g\">pic.twitter.com/iVBpT8K48g</a></p>&mdash; Stephen Bush (@stephenkb) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephenkb/status/770741279336570880\">August 30, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>People planning to vote for Corbyn in the contest were more likely to rate his competence and electability, but even amongst this group only 56% said he was likely to lead the party to victory, and only 60% said he was competent.</p> <p><strong>2 - Smith\u2019s key strength is that he is seen as \u201ccompetent\u201d.</strong> But only 30% of the Labour selectorate said they saw him as competent - a remarkably low figure, given that he has put this trait at the centre of his leadership campaign. His biggest weakness is that he is seen as \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d - by 45% of those voting in the contest.</p> <p><strong>3 - Smith is seen as even less likely than Corbyn to lead Labour to victory at the general election by those voting in the contest.</strong> Only 12% of them said they thought Smith was likely to win the general election for the party. And even amongst those planning to vote for Smith the figure was only 33%.</p> <p><strong>4 - Women seem to be more pro-Corbyn than men. </strong>The YouGov crosstabs have 67% of female members of the Labour selectorate backing Corbyn, but only 57% of men. Crosstab findings are less reliable than the headline poll findings (because they involve a smaller sample), but a 10-point gap is quite big, and so some gender gap is probably real. During the campaign <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/2016/07/four-times-owen-smith-has-made-sexist-comments\">Smith has been accused of sexism,</a> and Corbyn\u2019s advantage with women may be a result.</p> <p><strong>5 - Corbyn\u2019s support is broadly consistent amongst all age groups. </strong>It is often assumed that his backing comes from the young. But the crosstabs (in so far as they are reliable - see above) suggest age is not a factor in his support. His ratings are 61% amongst 18 to 24-year-olds, 64% amongst 25 to 39-year-olds, 63% amongst 40 to 59-year-olds and 57% amongst over-60s.</p> <p><strong>6 - A majority of Labour members are in favour of getting rid of the nuclear deterrent. </strong>Some 53% of those voting in the leadership contest, and 52% of those voting because they are full party members, think Britain should get rid of nuclear missiles. Only 23% of party members favour full Trident renewal, while another 14% of members favour replacing the Trident submarines but not equipping them with nuclear missiles. These figures suggest Corbyn, who is in favour of nuclear disarmament, would be able to win a vote on Trident if he put it to a ballot of party members. But this would involve bypassing the normal policy-making procedure, a vote at party conference. Corbyn would find it much harder to win a conference vote on this because unions have 50% of the vote at conference and the big unions are pro-Trident because they want to preserve defence jobs.</p> <p><strong>7 - Corbyn\u2019s supporters are more likely to leave the Labour party if they do not get the leader they want than Smith\u2019s. </strong>Corbyn\u2019s supporters sometimes accuse their opponents of wanting to split the party <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/31/owen-smiths-team-says-corbyn-reluctant-to-take-part-in-live-debates\">(John McDonnell has said this explicitly.)</a> But the YouGov poll suggests the Corbynistas would be more likely to walk away. Asked what would happen if Corbyn won, and his opponents formed a rival party, 18% of members said they would leave and join it. But when asked what would happen if Smith won, and his opponents formed a rival party, 32% of members said they would leave and join it.</p> <p><em>UPDATE:</em> On Twitter and perhaps BTL (I have\u2019t read comments yet) readers have challenged this on a couple of grounds.</p> <p>First, Genie Research points out that, given there are almost twice as many Corbyn backers as Smith backers, it is not surprising that Corbyn backers seem more included to split.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/genieresearch/status/770932197041770496\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow</a> Maths is wrong on 7/10: Corbynite Propensity To Leave = 32/62 = 52%; Smithite PTL = 18/38 = 47%. A very small gap - half each</p>&mdash; Genie Research (@genieresearch) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/genieresearch/status/770932197041770496\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The crosstabs present slightly different figures. Amongst those planning to vote Corbyn, 54% would join a new party if they did not get the leadership result they wanted. Amongst Smith supporters, the figure is 45%. So there is a difference - but it is not a big one.</p> <p>Second, some readers think the first sentence in paragraph 7 is misleading because the YouGov questions were based on the assumption that MPs might split and form a new party, and arguably it is the anti-Corbynites in the PLP who are most likely to do this. It is certainly true that no pro-Corbyn MPs have been talking about forming a new party if Corbyn loses. But anti-Corbyn MPs do not seem to be seriously talking about a new party either. There are reports that some of them are considering setting up a new gropu in parliament. But launching an entirely new party would be hugely problematic, and I am not aware of any MP advocating this.</p> <p>What is true is that some people who used to support other parties (eg, the Greens, TUSC) have joined Labour because they like Corbyn. It is easy to see them leaving if he were replaced - although that is not the same as them defecting to form a new party.</p> <p><strong>8 - More than a third of those voting in the contest (39%) think it is likely the Labour will split when it is over.</strong><br></p> <p><strong>9 - Almost half of those voting in the contest (48%) think Labour MPs should be subjected to mandatory reselection.</strong></p> <p><strong>10 - The traingate controversy damaged Corbyn\u2019s standing in the contest - but not by much. </strong>Some 20% of those voting in the contest said they had a more negative view of him as a result of it, against 10% who said they had a more positive view of him as a result. Almost 70% said it had no effect on their thinking.</p> <p>As I said earlier (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/aug/31/corbyn-labour-leadership-yougov-poll-leadership-with-increased-majority-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57c685f6e4b0f6cb85628930#block-57c685f6e4b0f6cb85628930\">9.02am)</a> YouGov\u2019s record last year suggests this poll is likely to be a reasonably reliable guide to the eventual outcome. But <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/08/30/labour-leadership-election-corbyn-leads-smith-24/\">in his own write-up of the survey,</a> YouGov\u2019s Matthew Smith says it is important to remember the various factors that could lead to the final result being different.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are a number of important caveats that should be highlighted. Our survey sample is composed of 1,236 members of the Labour selectorate, with the representation levels of difference membership types (member/supporter/union affiliate) based on how each group turned out in the 2015 leadership election. Changes in turnout have the potential to affect the results: this is particularly true of trade union affiliates (amongst whom turnout was low in 2015) given that the GMB is under new leadership and has come out for Smith this time round.</p> <p>The make-up of registered supporters is also difficult to judge, whilst the effects and scale of Labour party membership suspensions also has the potential to make a difference. Last, but not least, there are still three weeks left to vote, and unforeseen events could drastically affect the course of the contest. Nevertheless, Team Corbyn will be pleased by the security afforded by the double digit lead they are currently sitting on.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T11:21:43.559Z\">at 12.21pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c697c1e4b0df5f040dbec4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T08:54:44.820Z\">9.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Anna Soubry,</strong> the Conservative former business minister and an opponent of Brexit, was on the Today programme this morning being interviewed ahead of today\u2019s cabinet meeting at Chequers (which she is not attending, obviously.)

May has suggested that taking control of immigration will be a priority, even if that results in Britain not being able to remain a full member of the single market.</p> <p>(Two weeks ago ITV\u2019s Robert Peston wrote <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pestonitv/posts/1675210406137031\">a revealing Facebook post about the government\u2019s Brexit thinking.</a> Peston did not disclose his sources, but it read as if it were based on a briefing from someone in David Davis\u2019s Brexit department.

  "<p>Parts of the EU-Turkey migration deal have effectively been suspended due to the withdrawal of Turkish liaison officers from Greek islands, according to the director of the UN refugee agency in Europe.</p> <p>Created in March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/eu-deal-turkey-migrants-refugees-q-and-a\">the EU-Turkey pact aims to deter migration</a> to Europe by ensuring the deportation of most people arriving in Greece from Turkey. In exchange for readmitting these migrants and increasing the policing of its borders, Turkey has been promised \u20ac6bn and favourable visa conditions for Turks travelling to Europe.</p> <p>European politicians fear the deal will collapse should negotiations over the visa liberalisation falter. But in reality the arrangement has already stalled due to the departure of Turkish police from Greece following the failed coup in Ankara in mid-July, the UNHCR\u2019s Vincent Cochetel said.</p> <p>\u201cDe facto some aspects of the deal are suspended,\u201d Cochetel told the Guardian, echoing <a href=\"http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=819382\">a warning he first made earlier in the month</a>.</p> <p>According to government protocol, deportations cannot take place without the presence of the police. \u201cThey are not back,\u201d said Cochetel. \u201cWe understand that the Greek police and Frontex [the EU\u2019s border agency] are re-establishing contact with their Turkish counterparts, but the dates keep changing, so we don\u2019t know when cooperation will restart.\u201d</p> <p>UNHCR has lost access to the two main detention centres to which deportees are taken after returning to Turkey, casting a further cloud over the deal\u2019s future. The EU has justified deporting people back to Turkey on the contentious basis that Turkey has a functioning asylum system, but the denial of access to UNHCR highlights one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/11/fewer-than-01-of-syrians-in-turkey-in-line-for-work-permits\">the criticisms of this argument</a>.</p> <p>Following Turkey\u2019s failed coup attempt, Cochetel said, \u201cthere were major disruptions to the major Turkish institutions. In the coastguards some of the senior officers were removed from their positions. The same happened in the [directorate for migration management]. Our key interlocutors have not been immune from the drive to remove [from Turkish institutions] members of the G\u00fclen movement [which is accused of organising the attempted coup].\u201d</p> <p>Cochetel was hopeful that the EU-Turkey deal would hold, citing high-level discussions currently taking place <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/eu-and-turkey-restart-talks-over-migrant-pact\">between EU officials and Turkish politicians</a>. \u201cSome elements of the deal will be maintained,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Turkey\u2019s complicity is not the only issue: Greek appeals boards have been reluctant to deport people back to Turkey, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/syrian-refugee-wins-appeal-against-forced-return-to-turkey\">upholding challenges by several refugees</a>.</p> <p>Should either Greece fail to deport people back to Turkey, or Turkey refuse to accept them, European politicians fear there will be a renewed spike in migration to Greece. But the dire conditions for the 57,000 refugees currently stranded in Greece, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/balkans-refugee-route-closed-say-european-leaders\">the closure in March</a> of a humanitarian corridor that previously funnelled refugees from Greece to Germany, have also proved to be a deterrent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/it-took-on-a-life-of-its-own-how-rogue-tweet-led-syrians-to-germany\">'It took on a life of its own': how one rogue tweet led Syrians to Germany</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Irregular migration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/tens-of-thousands-migrate-through-balkans-since-route-declared-shut\">continues by other routes through the Balkans</a>, but arrival numbers to Greece have fallen drastically since March. In August there has been a marginal increase in people landing on Greek islands, prompting <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/after-initial-drop-fresh-surge-in-migrant-arrivals-puts-extra-strain-on-greece-1472597240\">panicked headlines</a>. But the rate has been in keeping with that of equivalent summer surges in 2014 and 2013, and a long way short of the unprecedented levels in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing compared to the level of last year, so I think the Turkish authorities are still doing something to stop people from leaving,\u201d said Cochetel. \u201cA few hundred [more arrivals per week] is not dramatic. It\u2019s manageable.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, even a small spike in arrivals exacerbates an already abject situation on the Greek islands, where the detention camps have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/19/refugee-babies-milk-supplies-greek-detention-centre-chios\">overcrowded for several months</a>. Prior to the EU-Turkey deal, refugees could leave the islands for the Greek mainland within days, but now most are detained there, creating a logjam.</p> <p>\u201cThe situation here is getting worse and worse,\u201d said Methkal Khalawi, a Syrian former oil engineer stranded in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/19/refugee-babies-milk-supplies-greek-detention-centre-chios\">squalid conditions</a> on the island of Chios. \u201cYesterday 90 refugees arrived here to Chios, [and] a lot of them slept at the beach.

She has said that her focus at the time was on electing a new leader in order to ensure an orderly transition.</p> <p>In her memoir, she wrote: \u201cIn the subsequent days I spoke with my counterparts around the hemisphere \u2026 We strategized on a plan to restore order in Honduras and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of Zelaya moot.\u201d<br></p> <p>Leaked emails from Clinton\u2019s private server which were published by WikiLeaks show that during this period, the US <a href=\"http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Clinton-Emails-US-Warned-OAS-Head-on-Support-for-Honduran-Prez-20160728-0020.html\">pushed the OAS to support new elections and sideline Zelaya</a>. </p> <p>But the ousted leader still had real support at home: tens of thousands of people took to the streets in daily demonstrations demanding his return and the cancellation of the November elections which Clinton advocated. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the crackdown was brutal, said Karen Spring of the Honduras Solidarity Network. \u201cPeople were beaten, tortured, disappeared, jailed illegally.

Between 2009 and 2015, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) issued 41 protective measures covering hundreds of union workers, lawyers and LGBT, environmental and indigenous activists who were facing imminent risks.

  "<p>When Saeed arrived in Jordan as a seven year old, he was in shock and angry at the world. A bomb had left him half blind and half deaf, wheelchair-bound and without an arm.</p> <p>Three years on, he has been transformed. He can still recount the ball game that ended with most of the children in his neighbourhood in Syria dead, but he is a new boy, full of life and energy. </p> <p>He bounds from his wheelchair, crawling along the floor at speed, playing games with the other children. After countless counselling sessions with a psychologist, he now excels in his studies. He still misses his mother, who had to return to Syria to care for his two sisters \u2013 his elder brother and his father were both killed in the war. But progress for Saeed has been remarkable; he has hope, a rare and precious thing in a refugee community beset by many ills.</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cThere was something wounded inside him,\u201d said Iyad al-Ayyubi, who runs educational programmes at the centre in Amman called <a href=\"http://souriyat-across-borders.org/\">Souriyat Across Borders</a>.</p> <p>Syria\u2019s civil war has not only uprooted millions and maimed and killed hundreds of thousands, it has created a hidden mental health crisis from trauma, displacement, injury, discrimination, limbo, exploitation and loss.</p> <p>Sarah Jaloudi, a psychologist with International Medical Corps, estimates that three quarters of refugees need mental health support and treatment.</p> <p>Symptoms range from depression, suicidal tendencies, anxiety disorders, self-imposed isolation, behavioural disorders and shell shock. They have also led to what doctors say are higher rates than usual of psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia, as well as epilepsy. </p> <p>Three quarters of refugees with mental health problems in Jordan have severe emotional disorders, according to statistics by International Medical Corps published in 2015, based on the records of over 6,300 patients. In Turkey, 40% of patients suffered from bouts of epilepsy, and both there and in Lebanon, 16% had psychotic disorders. A 2013 survey by Save the Children found that half of all Syrian teenagers in Lebanon had contemplated suicide.</p> <p>\u201cThey will suffer in the future,\u201d said Wael Samara, the only psychiatrist permanently based in the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, with a population of 80,000 people, who works with International Medical Corps. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"907222524b7b47d9c5e5d49ccd59e32aa8ed1d6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/907222524b7b47d9c5e5d49ccd59e32aa8ed1d6f/0_0_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wael Samara\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wael Samara, the only psychiatrist permanently based at the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kareem Shaheen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there is hope. Refugees and aid workers in Jordan say even the limited medical treatment, programmes and counselling on offer at several locations have produced good results, helping refugees who have been traumatised and continue to suffer daily.</p> <p>\u201cHere you find someone who really feels what you\u2019re feeling, and teaches you how to deal with your problems,\u201d said Rasha, a 17-year-old refugee who was married at 13 and has two children.</p> <p>Rasha, a pseudonym, was speaking at a space set up by International Medical Corps in the Zaatari camp for children who need counselling and mental health treatment. Her case workers said her problems stemmed primarily from growing jealous of her own children, being a child herself, being angered by her husband spoiling them more than her, and which led to repeated beatings of her daughter. </p> <p>Counselling and group therapy sessions have helped her come to terms with her children and case workers say she has stopped abusing her daughter. </p> <p>\u201cWe need to keep finding solutions,\u201d said Razan Obeid, who runs a social development centre for the Jordanian Red Crescent, with branches all over the country that between them last year counselled 30,000 people, mostly Syrians.</p> <p>At a facility in the impoverished northern Hashimi neighbourhood of Amman, the walls are adorned with colourful murals and drawings by children, who come for respite from what they describe as rampant exploitation and discrimination outside. A card on the wall bears the word \u201chuqooq\u201d \u2013 or rights. Here they play, engage with other children, have healthy social lives and learn about their rights as children. Parents also come, and say the counselling has reduced domestic violence often prompted by unemployed fathers. </p> <p>The staff describe similar success with violent and aggressive children. One boy, Nabil, arrived in Jordan after an arduous flight from his home in Homs. At 12, he was tortured and electrocuted by government agents looking for his father in a case of mistaken identity, with one thug holding a knife to his throat and threatening to kill him.</p> <p>Now he is 16, a shy, quiet teenager too small for his age. From being an angry child, he now helps local staff organise therapy sessions for youngsters. In Souriyat Across Borders, which functions as an all-inclusive centre housing war-wounded men, women and children, staff speak with amazement of childrem who arrived disoriented and traumatised, and whose behavioural disorders were vastly improved with treatment and counselling.</p> <p>Hisham, a 14-year-old boy, arrived after his family died in a missile strike on their home. After a bout of aggression in which he refused to study and initially rejected resettlement in Canada, he picked up photography after staff gave him a camera.</p> <p>\u201cHe wants to come back from Canada and be a war photographer, because when the missile fell on their home he saw that the only person running towards it was the photographer who wanted to document it,\u201d said Ayyubi, who runs education programmes at the centre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c2e0c9d5660c0cc7bb18b120389092c68868f68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c2e0c9d5660c0cc7bb18b120389092c68868f68/0_998_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child\u2019s painting at a Red Crescent centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child\u2019s painting at a Red Crescent centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kareem Shaheen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But aid workers and doctors complain that there is little support for mental health treatment \u2013 funding is often scarce and donors prefer to pay for basic provisions such as shelter and food, which are also in short supply.</p> <p>Most humanitarian organisations prefer not to pay for specialists in mental health who can provide individual counselling to refugees, which they see as inefficient, and so most rely on what they call \u201cpsycho-social support\u201d \u2013 group therapy sessions that involve drama and role-playing as well as artwork for children and sessions for their parents, while referring tougher cases to more specialised NGOs. </p> <p>Some like International Medical Corps have the expertise to provide specialised care, such as psychiatrists, who can prescribe medication for conditions including schizophrenia, or group sessions for child brides and their families. In Zaatari, the 80,000 refugees who still in the desolate, dusty camp have one permanent psychiatrist, and another challenge is getting families on board with treatment despite the stigma of mental health in the region.</p> <p>Some programmes, such as sessions for husbands in child marriages, have to overcome resistance.</p> <p>But if nothing is done, aid workers fear they will lose a generation of refugees to a myriad of social ills, depression, loss of hope and growing radicalisation.</p> <p>\u201cWe will have a lot of problems in the future,\u201d said Ayyubi, who works at Souriyat Across Borders. \u201cThese kids lost everything, and they may yet lose their future.\u201d</p> <p></p>",
  "<p>When I visited the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan earlier this year, I met with children who told me what education means to them. For Syrian youths who have been forced from their homes and have lost everything, education is about more than qualifications or test scores \u2013 it embodies their hope for the future.</p> <p>Children like those in Zaatari, and millions of others around the world, are central to the work of the <a href=\"http://educationcommission.org/\">International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity</a>, which I joined last September. This commission is committed to the fourth <a href=\"http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/education/\">United Nations sustainable development goal</a>, which aims, by 2030, to \u201censure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.\u201d</p> <p>This goal is still a distant prospect for far too many children. With so many development issues demanding our attention, policymakers should bear in mind that education is not just a good in itself; it is also a catalyst for many other development gains.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As the old African proverb goes, if you educate a girl, you educate an entire nation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the old African proverb goes, if you educate a girl, you educate an entire nation. Ensuring access to quality education for children, especially girls, will lead to fewer <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ending-child-marriage-development-goals-by-mabel-v--oranje-2016-07\">child marriages</a> and less child labour and exploitation. Education also brings long-term societal benefits: aside from increased political engagement, educated children contribute intellectual capital and pursue entrepreneurial opportunities when they grow up, boosting economic growth.</p> <p>Tackling the education challenge needs to start from two principles embedded in the goal.</p> <p>First, \u201cfor all\u201d means that we must focus on the children who have been left behind. Millions of children are out of school or are receiving a sub-standard education because of who they are or where they live. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, refugee children are <a href=\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002448/244847E.pdf\">five times</a> [pdf] more likely to be out of school than other children in the countries to which they\u2019ve been displaced. In all but two African countries, girls remain less likely than boys to complete a primary education. Getting these children into school will require new approaches that directly address their exclusion and make schooling genuinely accessible and relevant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gallery/2016/jul/07/a-girls-view-of-the-17-sustainable-development-goals-in-pictures\">A girl's view of the 17 sustainable development goals - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, \u201cquality\u201d: education must be effective, so that children actually learn. For the <a href=\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002452/245238E.pdf\">61 million</a> [pdf] children who are out of primary school, formal education is beyond reach. But, just as urgently, more than one-third of children of primary-school age \u2013 250 million \u2013 are not learning the basics, according to the <a href=\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002193/219349E.pdf\">Unesco Education for All Global Monitoring Report</a> [pdf]. Half of these children have been in school for at least four years. We must address the barriers to learning, both in the classroom and at home, by improving the quality of teaching and classroom conditions and teaching parents how they can support their children\u2019s education.</p> <p>Upholding these two principles will require increased investment. Last year, Unesco calculated that governments must <a href=\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002321/232197E.pdf\">double education spending</a> [pdf] as a share of national income to achieve the 2030 goals. This will require increased revenue from taxation and stronger efforts to collect what\u2019s owed. Donors also need to live up to their aid commitments and target aid more effectively. For example, less than one-third of education aid goes to Africa, even though the region accounts for almost two-thirds of out-of-school children. Moreover, at the moment, education budgets are often regressive, with almost half of spending in the poorest countries allocated to the most educated 10% of the population.</p> <p>Fixing education investment requires action in two key areas.</p> <p>First, we need equitable financing, with more investment in early childhood care and development, where there is the biggest potential for returns. Budgets must be focused on the most excluded children, and primary education must be free at the point of use, so that every child can learn. We also urgently need more transparency and accountability, so that budgets are visible and communities have a say in school governance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/20/we-must-focus-on-the-un-goals-that-are-the-best-value-for-money\">We must focus on the UN goals that are the best value for money</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, we need to strengthen domestic education systems so that governments see themselves as the guarantor of accessible, quality schools for their citizens, rather than abdicating that role to outside development agencies. In particular, we should push for partnerships between government and business to boost domestic resources for education, and eliminate illicit capital flows that deprive governments of the means to fund it, such as tax evasion and money laundering across national borders.</p> <p>With these priorities in mind, the education commission will deliver its recommendations at the UN General Assembly on 18 September, when the secretary-general will receive and act on them. The education commission will have succeeded if we are able to leverage the funding and political will to ensure that every child learns, regardless of their income, location, or social status.

I have not yet heard anything from my employer, despite being an NHS nurse for more than 14 years. Maybe EU nationals are not important, but this is surprising given the high number who work here. I know that without us the NHS would be unsustainable. There is no budget, investments and slack in the NHS to grow, develop and modernise. A few weeks ago, when I was back in the Netherlands, I had to accompany a family member to hospital and the healthcare service was so much better.

Even if we are being made to feel welcome at work, we no longer feel that welcome on the streets. Because of this, we are thinking about leaving Britain.

  "<p>They are overindulgent, overloaded and over here. Freakshakes \u2013 an Australian invention \u2013 found their way from Canberra to Newcastle (the English one) last year, and they have been multiplying around the UK at a horrendous rate ever since. For the uninitiated, they are milkshakes topped with cream, topped with cake, topped with sauce, with a handful of sweets thrown in for good measure \u2013 a monstrous mashup of a drink and dessert. Usually. Although the fact that one <a href=\"http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/watch-how-to-make-rebel-s-smokehouse-s-pulled-pork-and-peanut-butter-freak-shake/story-29581780-detail/story.html\">Yorkshire restaurant has thrown pulled pork and cheese into the mix</a> suggests we have reached the freakshake tipping point.</p> <p>Most follow a similar formula to the originals from <a href=\"https://www.patissez.com.au/\">P\u00e2tissez cafe in Canberra</a>: mason jar mugs are filled with milkshake and piled up with goodies that look as striking as possible \u2013 because, while they should taste good, the first bite is usually taken by the camera. \u201cThe freakshake trend has been a clear example of the influence of social media,\u201d says Olivia Edwards, senior analyst at food trends agency <a href=\"https://thefoodpeople.co.uk\">thefoodpeople</a>. She says Instagram \u201cgave them a platform to be seen and desired all around the world \u2026 the first thing most people will do is pop a pic on Instagram\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0426649cc24359d2f34a2266dd5fbdec427fd478\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0426649cc24359d2f34a2266dd5fbdec427fd478/0_0_2448_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caramel freakshakes, Sensations cafe, north London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caramel freakshakes, Sensations cafe, north London</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is true at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bluedogskitchen/\">Blue Dogs Kitchen in Cheltenham</a>, says cafe supervisor Marion Corden. Freakshakes went on sale there a couple of months ago and, she says, \u201cit\u2019s very rare that we make one that is not photographed\u201d. It was social media that brought freakshakes to the attention of Maria Michaelides when she opened <a href=\"https://www.mollybakes.co.uk\">Molly Bakes</a> cafe in Dalston, east London. \u201cI saw them on Instagram last summer,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to try one but Australia was a bit far to go, so I made my own and then I thought: \u2018I could sell these.\u2019\u201d She started with salted caramel and has just added cookie dough and cornflakes to the menu \u2013 the latter not specifically for early-morning visitors, although she says: \u201cSome people do have freakshakes for breakfast \u2013 I can\u2019t get my head around that.\u201d</p> <p>Vedia Glover, of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lilliolivercakes/posts/1212861438766068\">Lilli Oliver Cake Boutique in Manchester</a>, was already making \u201cfreakcakes\u201d, so the \u201cbig and bold indulgent style\u201d of the shakes appealed to her. She has put a new spin on them, too: \u201cA few customers requested the shake with a coffee, so I developed the \u2018freakaccino\u2019 \u2013 we add a shot of espresso. This is really popular with peanut butter added to it.\u201d</p> <p>For the standard freakshake, cafes start with an ice-cream milkshake, the edge of the glass is decorated, perhaps with a chocolate ganache or marshmallow fluff; double cream is added (about two inches or 5cm, says Corden); then people generally choose their toppings. Michaelides reckons that there are around 1,500 calories in her creation. Not everyone finishes them, but some do and then some. \u201cYou get people who come in for a freakshake and order a cake on top of that \u2013 and they don\u2019t even share it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The phenomenon is a counterpoint to the #eatclean trend, according to Edwards. It\u2019s an outlandish decadence that is a \u201ctotal rebellion against the pictures of perfection of those pushing hyper-healthy lifestyles that feel completely unattainable,\u201d she says. On the other hand, if you are the Guardian\u2019s restaurant critic Marina O\u2019Loughlin, \u201cthey\u2019re revolting, diabetes in a glass, food for the sad and the selfie-obsessed\u201d.

The lengths they will go to stop lorries so migrants can get on board have become ever more extreme \u2013 as well as cutting down trees to block the route, they set fire to trucks, lob petrol bombs and threaten drivers with chainsaws and machetes. The current situation is shameful. Last week I met truckers in Calais who face these attacks daily.</p> <p>For years the French and British governments have tried in vain to tackle the ever-growing problem of the Calais camps. They have built fences to keep refugees and migrants away from the docks, but the attacks on trucks now just happen further down the road. They have built containers for people to stay in \u2013 yet thousands more continue to arrive. But these attempts at ending the chaos have only worsened the symptoms.

McCain needs to beat Ann Kirkpatrick, who won her Arizona senate primary unopposed for the Democrats.</p> <p>Both incumbent Republican senators have an uneasy relationship with Donald Trump, whom they felt obliged to endorse as the party\u2019s presidential nominee. He may face more vocal criticism from them now their primary battles are over.</p> <p>McCain in particular was seen as vulnerable to a populist challenge by Kelli Ward in Arizona, but was comfortably ahead by 55 to 35 percentage points when the Republican primary result was called shortly before 9pm local time. </p> <p>Rubio launched his political comeback earlier on Tuesday night with a decisive victory in the Florida primary setting up a more winnable battle with Democrats, one that could determine control of the US Senate in November. </p> <p> Despite announcing his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/22/marco-rubio-re-election-florida-senate-seat\">decision to seek re-election</a> only two months ago, the freshman senator saw off a challenge from Trump-supporting real estate developer Carlos Beruff to win the Republican nomination by a comfortable 72 percentage points to 18.</p> <p> Previously Rubio had announced his retirement from politics after losing his home state to Trump by some 20 points in the presidential primary election. He was persuaded to change his mind as Republican leaders in Washington sensed that the Senate race in the state could prove pivotal.</p> <p> \u201cThis has been an unusual road back here with you tonight. As you know, after my race ended in March for the presidency I was prepared to become a private citizen,\u201d Rubio told supporters after the result. \u201cBut I just couldn\u2019t be at peace with the idea that we were going to not just potentially lose the Senate seat but lose the balance of power in the Senate at this critical moment in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d </p> <p> The Associated Press also projected that congressman Murphy had won the Democratic primary in the state by a margin of 59 to 18 percentage points.</p> <p> It sets up a tight race with Rubio in November, who is now narrow favorite to hold the state and could prevent Democrats netting the four seats nationwide they may need to swing control of the US Senate.</p> <p> Murphy saw off a lackluster challenge from Grayson, who was badly damaged by <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/alan-grayson-wife-florida-226090\">domestic abuse allegations</a> and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/alan-grayson-politico-reporter-226219\">reacted angrily</a> to inquiries into his background.</p> <p> It was a disappointing night overall for the progressive wing of the Democratic party, which had also hoped to unseat former Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz after she was seen to take sides against Bernie Sanders in the presidential race.</p> <p> Sanders endorsed anti-establishment candidate Tim Canova in the 23rd House district around Miami, but he lost to Wasserman Schulz by nearly 14 percentage points. </p> <p> Canova, who <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/canova-revolution-bernie-sanders-debbie-wasserman-schultz/497807/\">did not receive much direct support from Sanders</a>, hinted at a possible concession as soon as the polls closed, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tim_Canova/status/770759017702580225\">telling supporters</a>: \u201cNo matter what happens we should all be proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished in a short period of time.\u201d </p> <p> In another Florida House primary, the incumbent Democratic congresswoman Corrine Brown lost the party nomination following an indictment on fraud charges.</p> <p>But it is Rubio\u2019s strong comeback against anti-establishment forces within the Republican party that is likely to be the most memorable feature of the Florida primary.</p> <p> Beruff, a real estate developer who self-funded the campaign in a similar vein to Trump, had attacked Rubio for missing votes during his presidential campaign, not being anti-immigration enough and failing to wholeheartedly support Trump as the party\u2019s eventual nominee.</p> <p>Similarly, Ward blasted McCain for being soft on immigration and too old to seek his sixth term as senator of the increasingly diverse state.</p> <p>In Arizona the other big local news was the victory of controversial immigration control champion Sheriff Joe Arpaio in his primary.</p>",

That\u2019s less than 0.5% of Tate\u2019s income.\u201d</p> <p>Hughes said the 2010 figure still represented less than 1% of Tate\u2019s funding and came at a time when \u201coil was gushing into the Gulf of Mexico due to BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon disaster\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe company tried to buy public support by quadrupling the amount of money they gave the Tate.

  "<p>Immigration has been one of Donald Trump\u2019s signature issues since he announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. From the moment he got off the escalator at Trump Tower in New York and spoke about Mexico deliberately sending criminals and \u201crapists\u201d to the United States and the need to build a wall on the southern border, Trump hasn\u2019t stopped talking about immigration. </p> <p>But in his Wednesday speech on the topic in Phoenix \u2013 which will follow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-president-nieto\">his surprise visit to Mexico</a> \u2013 Trump will need to balance the hardline rhetoric he used throughout the Republican primary with the need to win a general election in November.<br></p> <p>Trump rode his hardline stance to victory in the primary. While his rivals refused to categorically rule out a path to legal status for any of the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States, Trump talked about <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trump-vows-humane-deportation-force\">\u201ca deportation force\u201d</a> to remove all of them <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/09/11/donald-trump-says-immigrant-deportations-done-in-two-years/\">within 18 to 24 months.</a> </p> <p>However, the Republican nominee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/27/donald-trump-deport-11-million-migrants-is-that-even-possible\">never worked out his plan in detail</a>. The Trump campaign has divulged little on its actual policy, save <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/18/donald-trump-immigration-mexico-economy\">a set of proposals</a> dating back to August 2015. At almost every rally, Trump pledges that he will \u201cbuild a wall and make Mexico pay for it\u201d, but he has rarely gone into more detail. </p> <p>But, facing a general election where he has major deficits in the polls and is reviled by Latino voters, the Republican nominee has begun what he called a rhetorical \u201csoftening\u201d in recent weeks, raising questions about whether he was ever sincere in his hardline stance. </p> <p>In the past week and a half, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/donald-trump-immigration-reform-sean-hannity-fox-news\">seemingly endorsed a path to legal status for</a> undocumented immigrants in an interview with Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity, only to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/25/politics/trump-no-legal-status-for-undocumented-immigrants/\">reverse himself</a> in an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. The back and forth prompted conservative talk radio show host Rush Limbaugh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/30/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-hacking-threat-election-live?page=with:block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69#block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69\">to admit</a>, \u201cI never took him seriously\u201d on immigration.

In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">a speech in Iowa</a> on Saturday, Trump spoke about details from his August 2015 plan that had gone almost unmentioned since, including the implementation of E-Verify (an online system that allows businesses to screen employees\u2019 work eligibility) nationwide as well as an exit-entry tracking system to prevent visa overstays. However, Trump dismissed the question of what to do with the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country, instead blaming the media: \u201cIn recent days, the media \u2013 as it usually does \u2013 has missed the whole point on immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the media wants to talk about is the 11 million or more people here illegally.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/donald-trump-immigration-plan-deportation-mike-pence\">Trump surrogates: Republican's position on immigration has not changed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mark Krikorian, a leading immigration hawk and head of the Center for Immigration Studies, bemoaned the fact that Trump has spent a \u201cweek and a half meandering\u201d on immigration. Krikorian, who has met with Trump on the issue, said this \u201cwas especially absurd given that it\u2019s a core, key issue. He\u2019s running as \u2018Mr Immigration Control\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Krikorian told the Guardian he thought that Trump can only end up in the place where he actually started, \u201cfocusing on enforcement tools like E-Verify and tracking for visa holders\u201d.</p> <p>The vocal immigration hawk thought \u201cthe question of what happens to illegal immigrants is secondary; [the] primary question is how we stop another 12 million people from coming here.\u201d He noted that Trump was on record saying that some form of \u201camnesty\u201d would always happen but that \u201ca politician has no business talking like that and that\u2019s the one most important thing that I am looking to not see, is some kind of guarantee or commitment of amnesty.\u201d But he said that he was far less concerned about the wall, which \u201cas a policy matter is not that important\u201d.</p> <p>In the meantime, those on the right worried about a rhetorical softening did find some comfort from an interview that Trump\u2019s son, Donald Jr, gave to CNN on Tuesday, in which he said that his father\u2019s stance on undocumented immigrants was still the same and that all 11 million had to leave the country. But as longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone once said: \u201cNo one speaks for Donald Trump but Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>The Republican nominee is scheduled to give his immigration speech at 6pm local time at the Phoenix Convention Center on Wednesday. </p>",

  "<p>A newly discovered <em>Tyrannosaurus rex </em>skull and partial skeleton have been unearthed in Montana by a team from the Burke Museum, Washington. The skull is being described as mostly complete and at least some of the skeleton has been excavated, though more remains in the ground and has yet to be uncovered. In addition to the skull (which includes the lower jaws), some of the ribs, vertebrae, and the hips have been found so there is likely much more to come as the work continues.<br></p> <p>As with many <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> skeletons, this one has already acquired a nickname and has become known as the \u201cTufts-Love <em>rex</em>\u201d after the discoverers of the specimen, Jason Love and Luke Tufts. It looks set to be an impressive skeleton and although it is likely to be some time before the material can be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2012/oct/01/dinosaurs-fossils\">prepared for research and display</a>, the nature of the material recovered so far suggests that it is in superb condition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d7b980ce385ae2d81c354989a35345581dfcc2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d7b980ce385ae2d81c354989a35345581dfcc2a/0_329_2448_1469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Tyrannosaurus tooth is exposed during excavations in Montana by the Burke Museum of Washington\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A <em>Tyrannosaurus </em>tooth is exposed during excavations in Montana by the Burke Museum of Washington</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Wolken</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> The new specimen is from the famous Hell Creek Formation of Montana that has yielded animals such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/07/triceratops-horns-evolved-dinosaurs\"><em>Triceratops</em></a>, <em>Ankylosaurus</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/mar/19/dinosaur-chicken-hell-anzu-wyliei\"><em>Anzu</em></a> and numerous specimens of <em>Tyrannosaurus</em>. The specimen is dated to 66.3 million years ago which makes it a relatively old <em>T. rex -</em> the last of these animals were still around nearly a million years later when the mass extinction hit. <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> is known from a variety of locations in the west of the US and Canada with some isolated teeth and bones from Mexico also suggested to belong <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2013/jun/20/dinosaurs-fossils\">to this genus</a> hinting at a large north-south range. </p> <p>Although palaeontologists are naturally intrigued to see the new specimen and the potential for research it might bring, this discovery is not such a rare event as might be supposed. Dinosaur fossils are of course rare generally, but we actually have a good number of <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> specimens in public collections (and there are a fair few more in private hands as well). Larger dinosaurs tend to have better fossil records (they are simply easier to find) and more recent animals tend to produce more specimens (they have had less time to be lost to various geological processes) and so although large carnivores are rare, it\u2019s perhaps not a big surprise that we have quite a few good <em>rex</em> specimens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf89c93e7f48481acda4231b0d0a4e0045098455\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf89c93e7f48481acda4231b0d0a4e0045098455/0_37_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Tyrannosaurus rex is unpacked in Leidenready to go on display in early September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> is unpacked in Leiden<br>ready to go on display in early September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marten van Dijl/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If anything, the Burke find is the latest in a little flurry of <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> specimens coming to the fore. Another Montana specimen is due to go on display shortly in Leiden in the Netherlands and one also recently went on display in Berlin late last year. Not only that, but at least one more tyrannosaur (a <em>Tarbosaurus</em>) has recently been repatriated to Mongolia after it was confiscated in the US following its illegal export. <br></p> <p>Clearly it\u2019s a good time for tyrannosaurs and indeed tyrannosaur specialists. <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> is one of the best known carnivorous dinosaurs given the amount of material, and has actually become something of a model organism for researchers, though more data is always welcome. As palaeontologist Dr Tom Holtz of the University of Maryland says \u201cWe can\u2019t do biology (whether on a living species or an extinct one) on single specimens, or at least we can\u2019t do it effectively. After all, the word \u201cdata\u201d is plural, so we need multiple specimens to really grasp the life and habits of a species.\u201d. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac20e6ed71293e3c58e178ca8dba79ccf6703ed6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac20e6ed71293e3c58e178ca8dba79ccf6703ed6/0_260_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The skull of the Tyrannosaurus rex known as Tristan on display in Berlin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The skull of the <em>Tyrannosaurus rex </em>known as Tristan on display in Berlin</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Still, the Mongolian specimen is just one example of specimens that have eluded researchers and the public and thus remains inaccessible. Several tyrannosaur fossils have recently come up for auction but have failed to find buyers (with museums or other private individuals) and there are plenty more that are known to be in private hands. Thus although tyrannosaurs are relatively well known compared to most dinosaurs, researchers are inevitably frustrated that a third or more of the known specimens cannot be studied. That makes specimens like the Burke discovery important as it can begin to fill in further gaps in our knowledge and of course potentially present us with new insights. We await with bated breath. <br></p>",

The prime minister has the authority to invoke article 50 to trigger the leaving process \u2013 but MPs will apparently have a role. There will be no hurry to start the process, but no dallying either.

They probably will, but no one wants to say so lest it encourages a wave of new arrivals.</p> <p>This will presumably be broached at today\u2019s meeting, but it is a detail beside the big questions that need urgent answers. One \u2013 even at this relatively early stage \u2013 is of May\u2019s own making. The potentially destructive dispute about demarcation and precedence that broke out between Fox and others is a product of the departmental structure May has devised. The Brexit campaign that dissolved so spectacularly in the shock of victory has to reconnect with its supporters and get back to the basic premise of \u201ctaking back control\u201d.</p> <p>The second \u2013 for all that ministers have been asked to accentuate the positive and suggest how Brexit can benefit their particular department \u2013 is the question that lurked beneath the whole campaign: single market versus curbs on EU migration. All the argument over the summer on this side of the Channel has been about negotiating as much single market as possible, while limiting free movement just enough to satisfy the leave voters. The difficulty here is that the EU insists that the two are indivisible and linguistic nuance is probably not what many leave voters had in mind.</p> <p>Two months on, the choice remains as stark as it was in June.

Remember back then Morrison argued there were excesses in the system and had to tiptoe back after cabinet decided against it. <strong>Sid Maher</strong> in the Oz has the <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/treasury/turnbull-and-morrison-supported-negative-gearing-shift/news-story/582c5b4f48784e8d20ac1573041aafa1\">report here</a>. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In The Turnbull Gamble,<em> </em>the \u00adauthors reveal the prime minister and the treasurer were \u201call in favour\u2019\u2019 of making changes to negative gearing but in a \u201cmore considered\u201d and \u201cless extreme way\u201d than Labor had.</p> <p>Asked about the revelations in the book yesterday, a senior source confirmed Mr Turnbull and Mr Morrison had been in favour of changes to negative gearing to remove excesses from the system. One theory put to the Australian<em> </em>yesterday was Mr Turnbull was keen to pursue the change as a counter to attacks on his wealth and improve his status with lower and middle-income earners.</p> <p>A government spokesman said both the prime minister and the treasurer were vehemently opposed to Labor\u2019s negative gearing changes.</p> <p>In their book, van Onselen and Errington write: \u201cThe issue was debated in cabinet, with <strong>Peter Dutton, Josh Frydenberg </strong>and<strong> Christian Porter</strong> arguing against making any changes.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>All three supported <strong>Mr \u00adAbbott</strong> in the leadership ballot that elevated Mr Turnbull to the leadership in September last year.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is vindication for Labor who took their difficult policy to wind back generous tax concessions on capital gains and negative gearing to the last election. The political heads in the Coalition thought they would have a clean kill on the policy by doing nothing and providing the contrast. It was clear that the electorate was not too worried.

The reason Turnbull is at a building site is to trumpet that today, children, is all about industrial relations and the Australian Building and Construction Commission. He also wants you to know that he has an economic plan. He says he is willing to compromise on the ABCC bill to get it through. There is your olive branch to the crossbench and specifically <strong>Nick Xenophon</strong> and <strong>Pauline Hanson</strong>.</p> <p>But there are skirmishes and frolics, both within his party and without. <strong>Cory Bernardi</strong> is introducing his private member\u2019s bill in the Senate to remove the words \u201cinsult\u201d and \u201coffend\u201d from the Racial Discrimination Act.

How long will Bill Shorten keep playing these political games?</p> </blockquote> <p>Late yesterday, the crossbenchers <strong>Adam Bandt, Andrew Wilkie </strong>and<strong> Cathy McGowan </strong>came out with their own bill on marriage equality. Labor has flagged theirs but not revealed the draft yet. Expect this any time today or tomorrow via suspension of standing orders. If not, the first Monday of the next sitting, when private member\u2019s business is due. </p> <p>From the papers, we now know <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> and <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> argued for changes to rein in generous negative gearing tax concessions but lost the battle. There are rumblings that the Coalition is preparing another bank initiative in order to head off Labor\u2019s expected motion for a bank royal commission. Meanwhile Labor bank warrior <strong>Sam Dastyari</strong> is having his own good times, with revelations <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/labor-senator-sam-dastyari-had-chinese-interests-foot-the-bill-for-travel-entitlement-repayment-20160830-gr4mlh.html\">reported by Latika Bourke</a> at Fairfax that he asked a Chinese donor to pay his travel bills after he exceeded the taxpayer-funded allowance.

  "<p>Japan\u2019s defence ministry has requested a record budget to counter growing Chinese military activity around a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea.<br></p> <p>The ministry is seeking 5.17 trillion yen (\u00a338bn) for the year beginning in April 2017. That marks an increase of 2.3% from last year, and is the fifth annual increase since Japan\u2019s prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shinzo-abe\">Shinzo Abe</a>, came to power in late 2012 vowing to bolster the military to address a surge in Chinese naval activity and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea\">North Korea</a>\u2019s nuclear weapons programme.</p> <p>The latest budget request marks a continuation in the shift in focus away from Japan\u2019s northern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/09/russia-build-southern-kuril-islands-seized-moscow-tokyo-abe\">maritime border with Russia</a> \u2013 where cold war Soviet forces once posed a threat \u2013 to an 870-mile chain of southern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/18/japan-steps-up-military-presence-east-china-sea\">outlying islands</a> stretching from the Japanese mainland towards Taiwan.</p> <p>Much of the hardware on the defence ministry\u2019s shopping list is designed to counter potential threats to Japanese territory in the East China Sea, including the disputed <a href=\"http://senkaku%20islands/\">Senkaku islands</a>, which are also claimed by Beijing.</p> <p>At the heart of the strategy is the development of a mobile amphibious force \u2013 modelled on the US marine corps \u2013 that would be able to respond quickly to an attempt to invade the Senkakus, which China refers to as Diaoyu.</p> <p>In the single biggest outlay, the ministry wants more than 100bn yen to upgrade Japan\u2019s Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missiles, seen as the last line of defence against a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/a-grave-threat-why-north-koreas-claimed-nuclear-test-is-a-cause-for-concern\">nuclear</a> or conventional attack by North Korea.</p> <p>The sense of urgency in Tokyo over missile defence is growing amid evidence that North Korea is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/north-korea-launches-ballistic-missile-says-south\">making progress</a> in its attempts to build reliable ballistic missiles capable of reaching Japan, including those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/north-korea-tests-submarine-launched-ballistic-missile\">launched from submarines</a>.</p> <p>The improvements will dramatically enhance the PAC-3\u2019s range and its ability to target incoming missiles.</p> <p>The Senkakus are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and potentially huge oil and gas deposits. The uninhabited islets are administered by Japan, but Chinese vessels have stepped up incursions into waters near the territories in recent months.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94f00abcb853d89834b78a8bc7448022dbc2955e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94f00abcb853d89834b78a8bc7448022dbc2955e/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Japanese ground self-defence troops during live-fire training.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Japanese ground self-defence troops during live-fire training.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aflo/Barcroft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To improve Japan\u2019s ability to patrol the islands, ministry officials want to spend 95bn yen on six Lockheed Martin F-35 stealth fighters, as well as more than 90bn yen on four Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and six Boeing Chinook twin-rotor helicopters.</p> <p>Incursions by Chinese planes into Japanese airspace near the Senkakus were met with a record number of scrambles by Japanese fighter planes between April and June, while Tokyo continued to resist Beijing\u2019s requests for talks on the dispute.</p> <p>This month, the Japanese foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, summoned China\u2019s ambassador in Tokyo, Cheng Yonghua, to protest against Chinese maritime activity in the area, saying it had contributed to a \u201cmarked deterioration\u201d in Sino-Japanese ties.</p> <p>Last week, however, Kishida and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, agreed it was important to establish lines of communication to avoid accidents near the Senkakus that could quickly escalate into a conflict.</p> <p>\u201cWe reached a common recognition that we have to control friction at sea firmly through the efforts of both countries,\u201d Wang told reporters during a trilateral summit in Tokyo that also included South Korea\u2019s foreign minister.</p> <p>As a prominent member of a group of conservative politicians who believe the postwar constraints imposed on Japan\u2019s military are unfair and out of date, Abe wants the country\u2019s self-defence forces to play a bigger international role that includes possible involvement in overseas conflicts.</p> <p>Last summer, his governing coalition pushed through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/17/japan-to-pass-security-bills-despite-protests\">controversial security legislation</a> that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/30/japan-pm-overturn-pacifist-defence-policy-shinzo-abe\">reinterpreted</a> Japan\u2019s war-renouncing constitution to allow the armed forces to exercise its right to collective self-defence \u2013 or coming to the aid of an ally \u2013 for the first time since the end of the second world war.</p> <p>Despite the broader scope afforded Japanese troops by the new laws, speculation is mounting that Abe, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/11/japan-could-change-pacifist-constitution-after-shinzo-abe-victory\">coalition dominates both houses of parliament</a>, will attempt to ditch article 9 of the US-authored constitution, which restricts Japan\u2019s military to a purely defensive role.</p>",

But DC hit a roadbump earlier this month with its all new <strong>Superwoman</strong>. This hero was trailed as Lois Lane with Superman\u2019s powers (or at least, one incarnation of Lois \u2013 there are a couple of them knocking about DC\u2019s current multiverse). After showing the street-smart journo getting a handle on her new abilities and cleverly saving Metropolis from a Lex Luthor-derived threat, writer-artist Phil Jimenez wrapped up his densely packed, often beautiful-looking first issue by \u2013 and here is the necessary SPOILER WARNING \u2013 killing her off. Some fans felt cheated, angry or simply confused. Marvel faced a similar backlash earlier this year when Captain America was unexpectedly revealed to be a sleeper agent for the nefarious Hydra organisation in a shocking final-page twist.</p> <p>Yet even in comics, it\u2019s rare for the title character to die in their first issue. So what happens next? Jimenez, who previously worked on an admired run of Wonder Woman in the early 2000s, has hinted at an overarching plan involving his ensemble cast (which includes, in a sneaky bait-and-switch, a second Superwoman) and the social media hoo-ha should at least juice up sales of issue two, due mid-September.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb63029ea9cd5994e7843ef4b621e0edff519d2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb63029ea9cd5994e7843ef4b621e0edff519d2d/0_25_800_951/421.jpg\" alt=\"Kingsway West issue one\" width=\"421\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There have been countless westerns about grizzled gunslingers seeking the quiet life only to be inexorably pulled back toward violence. In <a href=\"http://gregpak.com/category/comics/kingsway-west\"><strong>Kingsway West</strong></a>, a new four-part miniseries from Dark Horse, the taciturn hero is Kingsway Law, a preternaturally handy-with-the-steel regulator in a 19th-century north California shaped by a very different sort of goldrush. It\u2019s a vivid landscape where valuable-but-volatile \u201cred gold\u201d has caused mutations and magical phenomena, so as well as the standard wild west staples of six-guns and cool leather dusters, there are also bloodhound dragons and enchanted swords.</p> <p>This inventive mix of Game Of Thrones and Unforgiven is notable for featuring a Chinese protagonist in a genre in which Asian characters have long been sidelined as voiceless railroad labour or simply ignored completely. While writer Greg Pak has invested a lot of effort into his alternate-history worldbuilding \u2013 this is the sort of comic that begins with a parchment map \u2013 the story is driven by emotion. Law has something very valuable taken from him, and will do anything to get it back, even in the face of overwhelming odds. With heavily lined art by Mirko Colak and vibrant colour treatments by Wil Quintana, it\u2019s a handsome-looking book that feels as if it could go anywhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39a042e83666b3fed1d2354cac87016115dee674\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39a042e83666b3fed1d2354cac87016115dee674/0_144_600_675/444.jpg\" alt=\"Torchwood comics cover by Tommy Lee Edwards John Barrowman and Carole E.

To that end, UK-based publisher Titan Comics has been steadily growing its line of <strong>Doctor Who</strong> titles. There are now four separate monthly series, spotlighting Eccleston\u2019s brooding Ninth, Tennant\u2019s ferrety Tenth, Smith\u2019s fez-loving Eleventh and Capaldi\u2019s guitar-shredding Twelfth, respectively. </p> <p>Perhaps looking to complete the post-2005 nu-Who set, Titan has also just launched a new official <strong>Torchwood </strong>series, written by star John Barrowman with his sister Carole. The sci-fi siblings previously collaborated on a Torchwood novel called Exodus Code and the new comic picks up some threads from that story. Captain Jack Harkness is policing time and space in a research boat called the Ice Maiden, complete with a crew of trigger-happy hotties and a wry AI. But when the historical birthplace of Torchwood is attacked, it gives the pansexual rascal an excuse to rescue his old partner Gwen from a Welsh caravanning holiday. With saucy repartee, smart-aleck captions and a bunch of ninjas on flying jet-skis, the Barrowmans seem to be having a whale of a time jump-starting the franchise, and that enthusiasm is infectious</p>",

The Russian Woodpecker, a documentary about one Kiev artist\u2019s bizarrely compelling spin on Russian imperialism, took the <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/sundance-film-review-the-russian-woodpecker-1201420640/\">grand-jury prize</a> for world documentaries at last year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival. And Ukrainian-made docs about Maidan have won several top festival prizes; one, Winter on Fire, was nominated for the best feature documentary Oscar. </p> <p>Kozlenko has worked tirelessly to promote Ukrainian film, screening silent classics at major film festivals in Berlin, Cannes, and Karlovy Vary, and at the archives\u2019 headquarters, known as the <a href=\"http://www.dovzhenkocentre.org/eng/\">Dovzhenko Centre</a>. He has also developed innovative funding methods such as renting out unused building space, and recently launched a major renovation at Dovzhenko; a film museum is also set to open next spring.</p> <p>\u201cIvan has managed to single-handedly get the Dovzhenko Centre from an actual crumbling building into a legitimate cultural centre,\u201d says Myroslava Hartmond, the Ukrainian-British owner of Kiev\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TriptychGlobalArtsWorkshop/\">Triptych: Global Arts Workshop</a>.</p> <p>Hartmond and others, meanwhile, have sought to bring high-minded works to the masses.

Corruption remains <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/08/01/kiev-in-denial-ukraine-poroshenko-corruption/\">deeply endemic</a>. Unemployment hovers at around 10%, and the economy is still sluggish. Locals complain of huge potholes, pricey public services, and no parking.</p> <p>Kiev also appears to have become a more dangerous place of late.

To boost revenues and attract Kiev\u2019s youth, last year Kozlenko rented an entire floor of Dovzhenko to Plivka, a group known for organising all-night raves. Plivka and another outfit, Rhythm Buro, put together that party \u2013 the first event in Dovzhenko\u2019s backyard \u2013 and in the process likely awakened hundreds of young Kievans to their national film archives. </p> <p>Slowly, even the government\u2019s top-down Soviet style appears to be shifting toward <em>glasnost</em>. \u201cBefore Maidan, our ministry would decide what each group or theatre should perform,\u201d says Ukraine\u2019s culture minister Yevhen Nyshchuk \u2013 a former actor and a prominent figure during the Maidan protests \u2013 during an interview in a stately conference room at his ministry.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We encourage self-expression.

  "<p>Conservationists have long known that it\u2019s hard \u2013 and in some cases \u2013 nearly impossible to survive as a tiger in Southeast Asia. Burning forests, high human populations and unflagging demand for tiger blood, tiger skin and crushed tiger bone means the big cats have to tread a daily gauntlet of snares, guns and desperate poachers. Now, conservationists are discovering, belatedly, that the same is largely true for leopards. <br></p> <p>A sobering <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716302658\">new study</a> in Biological Conservation has found that the Indochinese leopard \u2013 a distinct subspecies \u2013 may be down to less than 1,000 individuals. And in the best-case scenario only 2,500 animals survive \u2013 less than the human population of Farmsfield village in Nottinghamshire.</p> <p>\u201cMost people assume that leopards are still common everywhere, whereas everybody probably knows by now that tigers and lions have become very rare in the wild,\u201d said co-author of the study, Jan Kamler with <a href=\"https://www.panthera.org/\">Panthera</a>. </p> <p>This has been in part due to the fact that leopards have been less rigorously studied than tigers and lions, but also the longtime assumption that leopards are more adaptable than many other big cats and therefore able to survive in more degraded habitats, on a wider variety of prey and closer to human dwellings. But even the leopard\u2019s supposed plasticity has not been enough to save them across most of Southeast Asia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ebb36a910b679c380753592bd988ba52ec86e21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ebb36a910b679c380753592bd988ba52ec86e21/0_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A spotted leopard in Cambodia.

They are extinct in Singapore and are potentially extinct in Laos and Vietnam. Meanwhile, the few individuals hanging on in China are not expected to survive. </p> <p>Kamler said the illegal wildlife trade is the biggest factor behind this massive decline. </p> <p>\u201cIn particular, many areas have experienced epidemic levels of snaring, for wild meat and animal parts, which have devastated leopard populations in the region.\u201d </p> <p>Snares are rife across forests in Southeast Asia. Poachers may not be looking to kill a leopard \u2013 they may be after tigers for their body parts or small game for local consumption \u2013 but snares are indiscriminate killers. They will injure or kill any animal that stumbles on them them. Conservationists have warned for years that the forests of Southeast Asia are being <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2012/02/majority-of-protected-tropical-forests-empty-due-to-hunting/\">emptied</a> by overhunting for food, traditional medicine and the pet trade. And the Indochinese leopard is just one of thousands of victims in this local eradication of any living thing bigger than a mouse or a sparrow, a process that has come to be known as <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2014/07/its-not-just-extinction-meet-defaunation/\">defaunation</a>. <br></p> <p>At the same time, Indochinese leopards have been hit hard by deforestation, prey declines and what seems to be an increasing trade in leopard parts, including skins and bones. </p> <p>Although the Indochinese leopard was historically found in habitats across the region, the study found just two remaining strongholds for the subspecies: peninsular Malaysia and the Northern Tenasserim Forest Complex (spanning the border of Thailand and Myamnar). A third site was identified as a priority \u2013 the eastern plains region of Cambodia \u2013 due to the fact that the small population of leopards here have evolved some wild daring behaviors. <br></p> <h2><strong>Cambodia\u2019s banteng-hunting leopards </strong></h2> <p>Leopards are known for tackling an increadly wide variety of prey, but much of that is small and medium-bodied. Not so of Cambodia\u2019s leopards. An upcoming study by Susana Rostro-Garcia, a research student with <a href=\"https://www.wildcru.org/\">Wildlife Research Conservation Unit </a>(WildCRU), found that male leopards in Cambodia\u2019s dry forests routinely tackled one of the biggest animals in the area: <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2012/01/forgotten-species-the-wild-jungle-cattle-called-banteng/\">banteng</a>. These distinctly-coloured wild cattle \u2013 themselves endangered \u2013 can weigh more than ten times the leopard at their heels. </p> <p>Rostro-Garcia, who was also the lead author on the Indochinese leopard study, said that her research in Cambodia\u2019s Eastern Plains is the \u201cfirst study to show that the main prey of leopards was over 500 kg.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5cc0e6fb261a15a14e72eec06939896419805b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5cc0e6fb261a15a14e72eec06939896419805b7/0_0_1260_756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Banteng move across a camera trap in the dry forests of eastern Cambodia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banteng move across a camera trap in the dry forests of eastern Cambodia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WWF Cambodia/WildCRU/Forestry Administration</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Rostro-Garcia found that only big males, not smaller females, were killing banteng. And \u201ceven among the males there were large differences in diets, as some male leopards focused almost exclusively on preying on banteng, whereas other males did not consume banteng at all,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The results were particularly unexpected given the availability of small prey in the ecosystem, such as muntjac (small deer) and various species of monkeys. </p> <p>\u201cThe tiger went extinct in this landscape over 10 years ago, so perhaps its absence allowed the leopard to expand its niche to include larger prey than usual,\u201d Rostro-Garcia said. </p> <p>The leopards of Cambodia are also the last population of Indochinese leopards that are uniformly spotted. Other populations sport a mix of spotted leopards and black, or melanistic, leopards. </p> <p>Indeed, the largest remaining stronghold of Indochinese leopards in Southeast Asia is known for housing almost only melanistic leopards. </p> <h2><strong>Malaysia\u2019s black panthers</strong></h2>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The black coat of melanistic leopards may have made them \u2018perfect stalkers\u2019 in the dimly-lit rainforests</p> <footer> <cite>Reuben Clements</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Not only does Peninsular Malaysia have the biggest population of Indochinese leopards left, but it is home to the largest population of black leopards on the planet. This fact may have helped preserve the population. </p> <p>Their black coats make them \u201cless sought after for their skins compared to spotted leopards,\u201d said Reuben Clements, an Associate Professor with Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, who has studied leopards in the region for several years. </p> <p> He also said the population may have hung on here due to \u201cmore forest\u201d and the fact that the denser canopy of this rainforest could offer \u201cadditional habitat for leopards to utilize and to evade dangers on the ground.\u201d</p> <p> But why are the vast majority of leopards here melanistic? </p> <p>\u201cNo one knows for sure,\u201d said Clements. \u201cSome suspect genetic drift. Others suspect the black coat of melanistic leopards may have made them \u2018perfect stalkers\u2019 in the dimly-lit rainforests, allowing them to compete with tigers for similar sized prey.\u201d</p> <p>As such, black leopards here may have found themselves with an evolutionary advantage. <br></p> <h2> <strong>Leopards in trouble everywhere</strong></h2> <p>The Indochinese leopard survey comes close on the heels of a larger study that found that the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/04/leopards-have-lost-75-percent-of-historical-habitat\">leopards have lost 75% of their range</a> across their full territory, from South Africa to Java. The survey has resulted in the species being downlisted on the IUCN Red List from near threatened to vulnerable. </p> <p>This means that of all the world\u2019s big cats (those in the genus Panthera) only one, the jaguar, is not considered threatened with extinction \u2013 it remains listed as near threatened. </p> <p>Conservationists, though, believe the situation can be turned around. </p> <p>\u201cIf governments can get poaching and snaring under control, then leopards would have a promising future in the Southeast Asia,\u201d said Kamler, who noted that there was still plenty of empty habitat available with sufficient prey. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe question is whether there will be any leopards left in the region to make a comeback, depending on when the governments finally decide to get serious about reducing the poaching,\u201d he added.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2016/mar/01/tiger-country-scientists-uncover-wild-surprises-in-tribal-bangladesh\">Tiger country? Scientists uncover wild surprises in tribal Bangladesh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Combating snaring is particularly tricky, since many forests in the region are already blanketed with snares that would need to be removed \u2013 a difficult, but hardly impossible, task. If achieved, however, de-snaring would aid many other endangered species as well. <br></p> <p>Kamler thinks that leopards may have been largely overlooked in conservation circles because they are smaller and were long-considered to be less threatened than the super-popular tigers.But he hopes these recent surveys serve as a wake-up call. <br></p> <p>\u201cOnce people realize that leopards are becoming just as rare as the other big cats, hopefully there will be more interest in this species, and efforts to save them will increase,\u201d said Kamler, who added that in his opinion the leopard was \u201cthe most beautiful of the large cats.\u201d</p> <p>Okay, so ,tigers might disagree. And so might jaguars and snow leopards. But it\u2019s hard to dispute that leopards are still not getting the attention they deserve \u2013 or require. They may be more flexible than other big cats, but even this can only get them so far against the onslaught of butchery now occurring in Southeast Asia. <br></p> <p>If the region wants to maintain leopards \u2013 or tigers for that matter, or bears, <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2013/02/pity-the-pangolin-little-known-mammal-most-common-victim-of-the-wildlife-trade/\">pangolins</a>, hornbill, banteng, muntjacs, songbirds, monitor lizards, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/jun/25/dhole-asia-endangered-tiger-ignored\">dholes</a>, pretty much every species of turtle and some species that scientists have probably never even described \u2013 officials will finally have to get tough, really tough, on the wildlife trade. <br></p>",
  "<p>Minority ethnic political candidates face an \u201celectoral penalty\u201d of four points when they stand in areas with large numbers of white voters, according to a study which suggests the trend is being driven primarily by discrimination.</p> <p>Research has found that aspiring politicians who are Muslim face the biggest negative impact, with an eight-point disadvantage at the ballot box.</p> <p>Stephen Fisher, an associate professor at the University of Oxford\u2019s department of sociology, who carried out the research, said that even when all other factors that might depress the vote were taken into account, the race issue still existed.</p> <p>\u201cIf you control for everything you\u2019ve got and you can\u2019t think of anything else that can explain it away then it starts to look like pure prejudice,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe one thing that I did link it to was anti-immigration sentiment,\u201d he added, warning that measuring prejudice was difficult to do.</p> <p>Fisher\u2019s research is being unveiled in More Sex, Lies and the Ballot Box, a book about elections that has been edited by leading psephologists Philip Cowley and Robert Ford. </p> <p>\u201cSurveys have shown a decline in the numbers of people admitting to racial prejudice \u2013 so if they are telling the truth, we should expect people to vote in a less racist way than in the past,\u201d writes Fisher, in a chapter titled Racism at the Ballot Box: Ethnic Minority Candidates.</p> <p>To address the question he first looked in detail at the 2010 election result because it included large surveys of voters in seats with BME (black and minority ethnic) candidates.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you analyse this data you find that ethnic minority candidates suffered an average electoral penalty of about four points at the hands of white voters. But not all ethnic minority candidates are equally discriminated against \u2013 and not all white voters engage in racial discrimination at the ballot box,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>\u201cMuslim candidates were particularly likely to be discriminated against, by the three-quarters of white voters who expressed negative feelings about immigration. This Islamophobia at the ballot box accounts for just over half of the overall ethnic electoral penalty.\u201d</p> <p>The research, which highlighted a similar trend in 2015, concluded that it was a puzzle why the decline in racism over time had not translated into a drop in the BME electoral penalty.</p> <p>\u201cBut it is clear that racial discrimination remains a problem at the ballot box as in other walks of life,\u201d Fisher adds in the chapter. <br></p> <p>The academic found that BME candidates were not penalised in more diverse areas, but with the exception of Pakistani voters and candidates there was no automatic bonus either. </p> <p>In areas with large numbers of BME voters, the bigger draw was towards Labour, something that the party has tried to take advantage of, Fisher says. </p> <p>\u201cBy contrast, in seeking to modernise and diversify his party, David Cameron\u2019s only choice was to place ethnic minority candidates in overwhelmingly white areas and suffer the electoral penalty because (some) white voters, and not just Conservatives, still prefer their MPs to be white,\u201d he adds. </p> <p>Some BME candidates have said they face difficulties being selected in areas with large white populations because members fear the impact it will have on the election results.</p> <p>However, Fisher argued that it was important for parties to act on the revelations, and to remember that four points was a relatively small margin that would not lose them a seat in the vast majority of cases. He said voters were still much more likely to be swayed by the party they would like to vote for, its leader and policies.</p> <p>He pointed to the way the Conservatives had placed Rishi Sunak in William Hague\u2019s constituency of Richmond, North Yorkshire, which remained an ultra-safe Conservative seat even after a drop in the majority. </p> <p>Amina Lone, co-director of the the Social Action &amp; Research foundation, who stood unsuccessfully for Labour in Morecambe and Lunesdale in 2015, said there was an \u201cunwritten, unspeakable cultural thinking that you must align candidates to the demographics that they represent\u201d.</p> <p>She argued that it made sense at one level, but only affected BME candidates. \u201cHowever, white candidates can represent any constituency. So what happens is you ghettoise the communities, you ghettoise the candidates and it plays into identity politics.\u201d</p> <p>Lone said her experience bucked the trend as she had been chosen in an overwhelmingly white area, and she does not believe race was a deciding factor in the community. However, she said the Conservatives had been better in recent years at avoiding stereotyping candidates.</p> <p>\u201cI would say that its offensive to all communities \u2013 it stigmatises white communities by saying there is an inherent racism, and it stigmatises candidates based on their ethnicity rather than their ability to represent their party.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

They are run by the 4,500 sisters in the <a href=\"http://www.motherteresa.org/07_family/volunteering/v_cal.html\" title=\"\">Missionaries of Charity</a> order, which she founded in 1950 to help those she called \u201cthe poorest of the poor\u201d.

The most formidable of her critics was another British journalist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/16/christopher-hitchens-obituary\" title=\"\">Christopher Hitchens</a>, who in 1994 made a film called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJG-lgmPvYA\" title=\"\">Hell\u2019s Angel</a>. It claimed that Mother Teresa treated the symptoms of poverty while ignoring the causes. She took money from distasteful political figures and rich fraudsters, and didn\u2019t publish any accounts. Her Catholic opposition to abortion and contraception made her a religious fundamentalist. Her Kolkata home for the dying had poor medical standards. It all constituted, Hitchens railed, a \u201ccult of death and suffering\u201d.</p> <p>Should all that disqualify her from being a saint?

When she told one man \u201cyou are suffering like Christ on the cross, so Jesus must be kissing you,\u201d he replied: \u201cThen please tell him to stop kissing me.\u201d Mother Teresa was unrepentant, insisting that a home for the dying was not a hospital. \u201cWe are not nurses, we are not doctors, we are not teachers, we are not social workers,\u201d she said: \u201cWe are religious.\u201d</p> <p>Certainly, Mother Teresa embraced an \u201costentatious anti-materialism\u201d that bordered on primitivism. In her San Francisco convent, she threw out all the mattresses, carpets, curtains and sofas, arguing that comfort corrupted. In the Bronx she refused to open a home for the poor when the local authorities insisted it had to have an elevator. In Rome she reprimanded her sisters for canning a glut of tomatoes, saying it revealed a lack of trust in God.</p> <p>Yet many found that severity attractive. From the 60s onward she was repeatedly named in polls of the world\u2019s most admired figures. Her compassion for the poor, rejection of consumerism and countercultural lifestyle resonated with the idealism of the times. She became part of the collective imagination as a casual synonym for goodness: \u201cWho do you think you are? Mother Teresa?\u201d</p> <p>But the two sides of the ledger are not incompatible. In war-torn Beirut, ignoring warnings of extreme danger, she crossed the green line <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/15/world/hospital-is-visited-by-mother-teresa.html\" title=\"\">to rescue mentally and physically disabled children</a> trapped in a hospital under fire. One Red Cross worker said: \u201cShe saw the problem, fell to her knees and prayed for a few seconds, and then she was rattling off a list of supplies she needed.\u201d She was \u201clike a cross between a military commander and Saint Francis\u201d. Providence and planning to her were not alternatives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02a900d41a15944d2b8b9cf6655bbfd9dd47450c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02a900d41a15944d2b8b9cf6655bbfd9dd47450c/0_0_2048_1867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mother Teresa looks at a photograph of Princess Diana after attending prayers for the princess in1997\" width=\"1000\" height=\"912\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Do small things with great love.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joy Shaw/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Ethiopia, travelling with a minister from the Stalinist Mengistu regime, she made small talk. But, when the world\u2019s press were present, she asked about a large building they had passed. It would make a good orphanage she said. It was a government ministry, he replied. But, said the crafty nun, hadn\u2019t the ministry just moved out? Wasn\u2019t it now empty? Well, yes, but \u2026 The minister blustered, but she countered his every response. Every question she asked, she already knew the answer to. She got her orphanage. She used the same techniques everywhere. When she first met the owner of the Daily Mirror, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/nov/03/pressandpublishing-daily-mirror\" title=\"\">Robert Maxwell</a>, she asked for a donation. When he offered a measly amount she declined it, and said she would go to the Sun instead. He paid up.</p> <p>Her defenders said she was not cosying up to dodgy rich people, but working in the world as she found it. Bad money could be redeemed by putting it to good use. Her critics called her disingenuous, but she insisted some good was always to be found in every person and any situation. Jesus mixed with disreputable characters. A good act might be a redemptive doorway for a bad person.</p> <p>This combination of personal faith, unremitting dedication, clarity of focus, PR savvy, organisational genius and constant travel made her, in the words of former UN secretary general Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar, \u201c<a href=\"http://catholic-link.org/2012/09/13/the-most-powerful-woman-in-the-word-mother-teresa-at-the-un/\" title=\"\">the most powerful woman in the world</a>\u201d.A saint is not a perfect person but a holy one.</p> <p>One of the qualities the Catholic church requires to canonise someone is that they have \u201cheroic virtue\u201d. In the past the church allowed decades, even centuries, to pass before declaring someone a saint. With the passing of time a candidate\u2019s foibles and weaknesses faded from common memory, leaving only their towering heroic virtue in the general mind. But, since Pope John Paul II, the fashion has been to accelerate the canonisation process. The Catholic church has made a serious mistake on this. Mother Teresa may merit sainthood, but that is a judgment it would be better to make a century from now.</p> <p>Saints can be signs of contradiction. During the Ethiopian famine of 1985, I visited three refugee camps near Alomata. Grain was being distributed in the first, amid much shouting and pushing. Triage doctors in the second were sorting skeletal people into those in need of treatment, those not yet quite ill enough to warrant it, and those beyond help. The soundtrack to the process was the piercing cries of pleading mothers.</p> <p>The third camp was run by Mother Teresa\u2019s nuns, to care for those deemed too sick for treatment in the second camp. It was an oasis of peace and serenity, where nuns dropped water on to the cracked lips of the dying, or simply sat and held their hands. \u201cDo small things with great love,\u201d Mother Teresa had instructed them.
