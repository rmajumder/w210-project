  "<p>French demonstrators blocked access to the Channel Tunnel and the Calais ferry terminal on Monday, causing severe transport disruption, to protest at the government\u2019s failure to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/31/dismantle-calais-camp-modern-slave-trade-traffickers\">close the refugee camp</a> known as the Jungle.</p> <p>Hauliers who said they had to run the gauntlet of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/uk-and-french-authorities-blind-to-growing-problems-in-calais-jungle\">increasingly daring and aggressive attempts</a> by stowaways to get to Britain were joined by farmers, shopkeepers and business owners on the march, which closed the A16 motorway outside the Channel port.</p> <p>A convoy of about 40 lorries and trucks was joined by 50 tractors and several hundred marchers who formed a human chain to converge on the access roads to the tunnel and ferry terminals.</p> <p>The blockade came to an end on Monday night. A Eurotunnel spokesman said it was understood the protesters agreed to end the blockade following concessions from the government. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><span tabindex=\"-1\">Representatives </span><span tabindex=\"-1\">came away from a meeting with the state representative of the region, Fabienne Buccio, with a new commitment \u2013 but no date \u2013 that the camp would be completely dismantled \u201cin a single step\u201d.</span></p> <p>Buccio also said a special fund to help businesses in need would be activated and more than 230 extra security staff brought in, bringing the total to over 2,000. However, the hauliers threatened to stage fresh protests and keep blocking the A16 if the migrant camp is not dismantled. <br></p> <p>Eurotunnel said on Monday night that the protest had dispersed and traffic would be back to normal on Tuesday. A spokesman told the Press Association: \u201cEurotunnel services have been operating normally all day. Some freight traffic was held back but, due to a lot of discussion and forward planning before the protest, most had been diverted and came at the weekend or last week.\u201d </p> <p>France\u2019s interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/uk-plays-down-calais-border-tensions-with-critical-ally-france\">pledged last week to dismantle the Calais camp</a>, Europe\u2019s biggest and most notorious open-air squat, which is now home to between 7,000 and 10,000 migrants and refugees. Many of them are desperate to reach Britain. The former French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who hopes to stand again in 2017, called on the British to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/29/uk-warned-calais-border-deal-is-in-danger\">set up their own holding centre</a> on the other side of the Channel. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/no-10-theresa-may-rules-out-points-based-immigration-system-for-britain-brexit\">No 10 rules out points-based immigration system for Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Eric Fiolet, a local haulier and one of the demonstration\u2019s organisers, said during the protest that the time for talking was over. \u201cIt\u2019s action we want, not promises that may or may not be kept. I don\u2019t know of any other industry or any other workers that have to put up with being attacked the way we are every night. Our people risk being hurt or having their lorries, which are their livelihoods, destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cPressure has been building up for three and a half years. We have exhausted all possibility of discussions and negotiations. Today our backs are against the wall.\u201d</p> <p>Over the Channel, the Road Haulage Association (RHA) said lorry drivers would stand their ground until action to dismantle the camp was taken and predicted the traffic chaos in France would have a knock on effect on traffic on Britain\u2019s south coast; however, the Port of Calais said a diversion had been put in place and ferries were operating as normal.</p> <p>\u201cThis will bring yet further misery to hauliers bound for mainland Europe and of course for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/29/how-operation-stack-is-affecting-uk-tourism\">people and businesses of Kent</a>,\u201d RHA chief executive Richard Burnett said. However, he added: \u201cThere needs to be a clear plan that shows how the camp is going to be dismantled. Drivers have been attacked on a daily basis for months. And there has been insufficient resource to protect.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"118aee8c183bb918f1fb54714ed854cb85aa1f25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/118aee8c183bb918f1fb54714ed854cb85aa1f25/0_44_5584_3350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People cheer and wave flares and French flags as a protesting trucker blocks the highway near Calais\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People cheer and wave flares and French flags as a protesting trucker blocks the highway near Calais on Monday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thibault Camus/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Monday, farmers, truck drivers and local residents spoke of their growing fear, frustration and anger at the failure of French, British and European politicians to solve Calais\u2019 migrant problem.

When it didn\u2019t stop and they failed, they grabbed tree branches and started attacking my car.

Every day it\u2019s getting worse and worse. We don\u2019t want confrontation with the migrants. We just want to go to work. And it\u2019s sad because it\u2019s turning the local population racist.\u201d</p> <p>Ludovic Demol, 45, said he was driving to work at 5am on the A16 two months ago with three colleagues when they stopped at roadblocks. \u201cA hundred or so men attacked our car with iron bars and sticks.

Talks took place on Friday between protest organisers and Cazeneuve, who has promised to gradually dismantle the camp and move asylum seekers to other locations in France.</p> <p>Farmers complain that the migrants make their way back and that dispersing them just shifts the problem elsewhere. Pierre-Yves, 47, who drove one of the tractors blocking the roads said: \u201cWe are not racist, we are not political, but we are in a situation that is not going away and we\u2019re having difficulty seeing the end, the solution. Farmlands are being camped on, crops damaged, and our turnover is hit.</p> <p>\u201cThis area has always welcomed migrants. The Polish came to work in the mines, Belgians like my grandmother came to work in the lace industry. But back then there were jobs and work. In the current economic situation, it\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p> <p>Other farmers fear the increasing violence will lead to tragedy. Vincent Cocquet, 41, said \u201cWe now confront this problem day after day, night after night and we all fear this is going to finish badly.

Nor, a tad more importantly, is it the case with a small group of people in Finland, hailing \u2013 through their heritage \u2013 from Kosovo. The Balkan state will start their first-ever <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football\">World Cup</a> qualifying campaign this evening, but rather than spend the last few days in anticipation, it has been nothing but fret. After being granted admission to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa\">Fifa</a> in May \u2013 with players of Kosovan birth or heritage who had represented other countries invited to apply for a nationality switch \u2013 there has been a long, laborious process of admin to get some of these players cleared to play tonight. The 3pm deadline today came and went with no updates and until a few moments ago, six of the squad were unaware if they had been declared eligible \u2013 hardly ideal circumstances for the manager Albert Bunjaki \u2013 but they have all been given the green light to play.

  "<p>The six-week holiday may have gone some way to concentrating the mind, but it has done little to clarify the thinking. Brexit remains as gnomic now as it did back in July. \u201cThe reason I\u2019ve been saying Brexit means Brexit is precisely because it means it does,\u201d said Theresa May, pioneering a new branch of illogical positivism during a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/04/theresa-may-refuses-to-guarantee-brexit-pledges-on-immigration-and-nhs\">rather tetchy press conference at the G20 summit in China</a>.</p> <p>What Brexit had appeared to mean at the G20 was the prime minister getting shunted to the back row of the leaders\u2019 group photo, being briefed against by the Americans and the Japanese and being left to big up the fact that Mexico, Australia and Singapore have expressed a vague interest in doing trade deals with the UK. It\u2019s a start, I suppose. If not the one that May would have been hoping for.</p> <p>Nor was there any real enlightenment on the meaning of Brexit to be found in the Commons as Brexit minister <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live\">David Davis gave his first lack-of-progress report</a>. This was Davis\u2019s first outing on the government front bench for more than 19 years and he came to the house flanked by Boris Johnson and Liam Fox as his security blanket. This unexpected show of unity was quickly explained; none of them have yet actually done anything to fall out over. Give it time. Quite a long time, to judge by Davis\u2019s statement.</p> <p>\u201cBritain voted overwhelmingly to leave the EU,\u201d he began. In Brexitworld a 52-48 vote is a total landslide. \u201cSo Brexit means Brexit means Britain leaving the EU.\u201d </p> <p>It wasn\u2019t long before the Labour benches started laughing and shouting, \u201cWaffle, waffle.\u201d Davis took this as an instruction rather than a criticism. \u201cWe will be creating beacons and roundtables of organisations,\u201d he waffled on. \u201cThere will be challenges but these are opportunities and everything will basically be fine once we\u2019ve got round to thinking about it with the brightest and best minds in Whitehall, though obviously there can be no room for complacency.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d interrupted the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart. Davis nodded. That was about it, though he was more than happy to repeat himself for another five minutes or so before concluding that he would be returning to parliament at regular intervals to give updates on everything that wasn\u2019t happening.</p> <p>When Emily Thornberry was first appointed shadow minister for Brexit alongside her day job as shadow foreign secretary it looked as if the reason she had been made to double up was because Jeremy Corbyn hadn\u2019t been able to find anyone else willing to do it. Now the duplication looks more like an act of genius. Why bother to have a separate shadow minister for a department that wasn\u2019t likely to be doing very much for the foreseeable future?</p> <p>\u201cSo far all we\u2019ve learnt about Brexit is that the government is not going to introduce a points-based immigration system or give \u00a3350m per week to the NHS,\u201d she observed. \u201cBoth of which were two of the key Vote Leave promises in the referendum campaign. The government has gone from gross negligence to rank incompetence. You\u2019re making this up as you\u2019re going along.\u201d</p> <p>Davis took this as a compliment. A sign that he was really getting to grips with the job and that progress was being made. Even if only by a process of elimination. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely not going to have a point-based system because that is what the prime minister said yesterday,\u201d he declared. \u201cWhat we are going to have is a results-based system that might be even tougher.\u201d There again, it might not. It was precisely to sort out these kinds of details that he would be consulting roundtables and beacons.</p> <p>Thereafter, the house divided on predictably partisan lines. Those on the remain side wanted to get to grips with the nitty gritty of what access to the single market Britain would get, how EU laws would be repealed and whether Britain would remain signed up to Europol. Those on the leave side thought such things were minor niggles and what really mattered was sticking two fingers up to the Frogs and the Hun and returning sovereignty to parliament. Though not to the extent of giving parliament a vote on the details \u2013 should any ever emerge \u2013 of the Brexit negotiations reached as it might vote against it.</p> <p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d several more MPs enquired.</p> <p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d Davis echoed. He\u2019s been on the back benches for so long he hasn\u2019t quite appreciated he\u2019s now supposed to be answering the questions not asking them.</p> <p>Not quite. There was just time for newspaper columnist Michael Gove to declare that everything was going far better than \u201cthe soi-disant experts with oeuf on their face\u201d had predicted and begging the minister never to consult anyone who might know what they were talking about. So far, that\u2019s the one promise Davis has been able to keep.</p>",
  "<p>Fighting to stay in the European Union may seem a hopeless cause if you look at the political situation today. The British people have voted to leave the EU.

This is not pie in the sky. After all, we were all lied to during the campaign. Brexiteers told us that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/eu-referendum-brexit-vote-leave-iain-duncan-smith-nhs\">Britain sends \u00a3350m a week to Brussels</a> and that Turkey is scheduled to join the EU in 2020, when neither is true. They promised we could have our cake and eat it \u2013 access to the single market, control of our laws, no budget contributions, an end to free movement and so forth.</p> <p>But on her way to the G20 summit, the prime minister refused to endorse some of Vote Leave\u2019s pledges \u2013 an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/no-10-theresa-may-rules-out-points-based-immigration-system-for-britain-brexit\">Australian-style points system to control migration</a>, no more contributions to the EU budget, and an extra \u00a3100m a week for the NHS. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/japanese-ambassador-warns-companies-could-leave-uk-over-brexit\">Japanese government warned that its firms may shift activities from Britain</a> to the EU if we botch the Brexit process.</p> <p>More politicians may even follow Gordon Brown in arguing that Britain can help lead the EU if it stays. The failure to make any positive case for our membership was one of David Cameron\u2019s many sins. We need such a vision if we are to persuade the electorate that we should stay in the EU.</p> <p>We also need to show that many of the genuine problems that troubled leave voters \u2013 stagnant wages, crowded schools and GP surgeries, not enough homes \u2013 are the fault of our government, not the EU.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A significant number of leave voters need to change their minds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is why I and some others who wished to remain have launched a new group, <a href=\"http://www.commongrounduk.com/\">CommonGround</a>, that promotes a broad vision for Britain, rather than simply wanting to stay in the EU. We have to find common ground with leave voters on the need for a fair and open society and for honest politics, which was in short supply on both sides of the referendum debate.</p> <p>Now, of course, even if some leave voters change their minds, the people may still not get a chance to vote on the Brexit terms. But let\u2019s peer into the crystal ball and consider a series of admittedly slim possibilities. The prime minister has craftily put<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live\"> two Brexiteers \u2013 Davis and Liam Fox</a> \u2013 in charge of negotiating Brexit. If they come up with a terrible deal, she may be able to dissociate herself from it.</p> <p>Alternatively, Labour may get a new pro-European leader or a chunk of its MPs may split off and form their own party. Although Corbyn seems to have the leadership sewn up and most MPs are too scared to leave the mother ship now, things may change in the next couple of years. If so, enough pro-European Tories may join forces with Labour to require the government to hold a referendum on the Brexit deal.</p> <p>It\u2019s also possible that such a plebiscite is already legally required. Under the so-called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-uk-leaves-the-eu-36749304\">referendum lock legislation</a> passed in 2011, the people have to authorise any treaty that replaces the existing EU treaties. A Brexit deal is likely to involve a new treaty. A clever lawyer could say this would replace the existing ones. If this argument holds water, we may have a new referendum whether May likes it or not.</p> <p>Finally, something may change in the EU that gives May a good excuse to consult the people again \u2013 either with a referendum or an election. In particular, if the EU was prepared to reform free movement, the prime minister might modify her mantra that Brexit means Brexit.</p> <p>Now, of course, the EU isn\u2019t remotely close to making such a change. But next year there is a French presidential election followed by a German general election. The far right is on the march pretty much everywhere, playing on people\u2019s fears over immigration. Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/mecklenburg-vorpommern-german-anti-immigrant-party-strong-regional-election-exit-polls-merkel\">beat Angela Merkel\u2019s party in a state election at the weekend</a>.</p> <p>The main concern across the Channel is over migration of large numbers of people from outside the EU, rather than freedom of movement of workers within the EU. But, as in the UK referendum, populist politicians may find it convenient to muddle the two issues. If so, mainstream politicians may respond by eventually agreeing to modify free movement.</p> <p>Listing these possibilities may seem like clutching at straws. Each scenario is a low-probability event. But they don\u2019t all have to occur for Britain to stay in the EU. If even one happens, that may be enough.</p> <p>What does have to happen is that a significant number of leave voters need to change their minds. That could in turn trigger one of the other possibilities \u2013 a U-turn by May, a change in the Labour party, or even the willingness of our European partners to offer Britain a concession to persuade us to stay.</p> <p>My own view is that the chance of staying in the EU is now no better than 25%. But no Brexit is a good Brexit except, just maybe, the pure fantasy one promised by the leave camp. Some things are worth fighting for even when the odds are long. This is one of them.</p>",
  "<p>Toxic nanoparticles from air pollution have been discovered in human brains in \u201cabundant\u201d quantities, a newly published study reveals.</p> <p>The detection of the particles, in brain tissue from 37 people, raises concerns because recent research has suggested <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/srep24873\">links between these magnetite particles and Alzheimer\u2019s disease</a>, while air pollution has been shown to <a href=\"http://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad140855\">significantly increase</a> the risk of the disease. However, the new work is still a long way from proving that the air pollution particles cause or exacerbate Alzheimer\u2019s.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is a discovery finding, and now what should start is a whole new examination of this as a potentially very important environmental risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d said Prof Barbara Maher, at Lancaster University, who led the new research. \u201cNow there is a reason to go on and do the epidemiology and the toxicity testing, because these particles are so prolific and people are exposed to them.\u201d</p> <p>Air pollution is a global health crisis that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/16/more-people-die-from-air-pollution-than-malaria-and-hivaids-new-study-shows\">kills more people than malaria and HIV/Aids</a> combined and it has long been linked to lung and heart disease and strokes. But research is uncovering new impacts on health, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/13/air-pollution-linked-to-increased-mental-illness-in-children?CMP=share_btn_tw\">mental illness</a> and <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001792\">reduced intelligence</a>. </p> <p>The new work, <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1605941113\">published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, examined brain tissue from 37 people in Manchester, in the UK, and Mexico, aged between three and 92. </p> <p>It found abundant particles of magnetite, an iron oxide. \u201cYou are talking about millions of magnetite particles per gram of freeze-dried brain tissue - it is extraordinary,\u201d said Maher.</p> <p>\u201cMagnetite in the brain is not something you want to have because it is particularly toxic there,\u201d she said, explaining that the substance can create reactive oxygen species called free radicals. \u201cOxidative cell damage is one of the hallmark features of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and this is why the presence of magnetite is so potentially significant, because it is so bioreactive.\u201d </p> <p>Abnormal accumulation of brain metals is a key feature of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and a <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/srep24873\">recent study</a> showed that magnetite was directly associated with the damage seen in Alzheimer\u2019s brains. Magnetite particles are known to form biologically in human brains, but these are small and crystal-shaped, unlike the larger, spherical particles that dominated the samples in the new study.</p> <p>\u201cMany of the magnetite particles we have found in the brain are very distinctive,\u201d said Maher. \u201cThey are very rounded nanospheres, because they were formed as molten droplets of material from combustion sources, such as car exhausts, industrial processes and power stations, anywhere you are burning fuel.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThey are abundant,\u201d she said. \u201cFor every one of [the crystal shaped particles] we saw about 100 of the pollution particles. The thing about magnetite is it is everywhere.\u201d An analysis of roadside air in Lancaster found <a href=\"http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/maherb/papers/HalsalletalAtmEnv2008.pdf\">200m magnetite particles per cubic metre</a>.</p> <p>Furthermore, said Maher: \u201cWe also observed other metal-bearing particles in the brain, such as platinum, cobalt and nickel. Things like platinum are very unlikely to come from a source within the brain. It is a bit of an indicator of a [vehicle] catalytic converter source.\u201d </p> <p>Other scientists told the Guardian the new work provided strong evidence that most of the magnetite in the brain samples come from air pollution but that the link to Alzheimer\u2019s disease remained speculative.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a very intriguing finding and it raises a lot of important questions,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.bme.ufl.edu/people/dobson_jon\">Prof Jon Dobson</a>, at the University of Florida and not part of the research team. But he said further investigation was needed: \u201cOne thing that puzzles me is that the [particle] concentrations are somewhat higher than those previously reported for the human brain. Further studies [are needed] to determine whether this due to regional variations within the brain, the fact that these samples are from subjects who lived in industrial areas, or whether it is possibly due to [lab] contamination.\u201d The researchers said they had gone to great lengths to avoid contamination.</p> <p>Air pollution was linked to a <a href=\"http://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad140855\">significant increase in the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease</a> by a major study published in 2015, while other research showed <a href=\"http://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad110722\">brain damage related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease in children</a> and young adults exposed to air pollution. Air pollution has also been <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3094421/\">linked to dementia in older men</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22332151\">women</a>. </p> <p>\u201cWe have not demonstrated a causal link between these particles and Alzheimer\u2019s disease but when you consider that magnetite has been found in higher concentrations in Alzheimer\u2019s brains and you know that magnetite is pernicious in its effect on the brain, then having a direct [air pollution] source of magnetite right up your olfactory bulb and into your frontal cortex is not a great idea,\u201d said Maher.</p> <p>Prof David Allsop, an <a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=1120\">Alzheimer\u2019s disease expert</a> at Lancaster University and part of the research team, said: \u201cThere is <a href=\"http://intranasal.net/Peer%20Reviewed%20literature/Talegaonkar,%20Intranasal%20delivery%20-%20An%20approach%20to%20bypass%20the%20blood%20brain%20barrier,%20I%20J%20Pharm%202004.pdf\">no blood-brain barrier with nasal delivery</a>.

Further work in this area is important, but until we have more information people should not be unduly worried. There are more practical ways to lower your chances of developing dementia such as regular exercise, eating a healthy diet and avoiding smoking.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There are plenty of reasons why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/no-10-theresa-may-rules-out-points-based-immigration-system-for-britain-brexit\" title=\"\">Theresa May\u2019s press conference in Hangzhou</a>, while perfectly competent in most ways, was not the most assured performance of her two-month premiership. She was, after all, attending her first top-level international summit with a group of more practised peers. She had arrived to find many of the G20 leaders in hostile and sceptical mood over Britain\u2019s Brexit vote. She was about to have a sticky encounter over nuclear power with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping. She had not faced the British press since becoming prime minister. It would have taken someone with the rhinoceros hide of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/keithvaz\" title=\"\">Keith Vaz</a> not to display a few nerves in such circumstances.</p> <p>Yet the main reason why Mrs May found herself on the back foot on Monday was wholly political not personal. On her way to China she had told the travelling press that the points-based immigration system promoted by the Vote Leave campaign during the EU referendum might not work. On Monday in Hangzhou, speaking from bitter experience from her time as home secretary, she amplified her sceptical view, saying that the trouble with points-based systems is that they take away migration control from governments by allowing people who meet the criteria to have automatic rights of entry.</p> <p>This stance was important for two reasons. First, it marked a clear break from the position adopted by the Vote Leave campaign, which had put a points-based system at the core of its immigration argument. This therefore puts Mrs May potentially at odds with Leavers in her own cabinet and party, including the trade secretary, Liam Fox, and Brexit secretary, David Davis, who campaigned for such a system. It also drew Nigel Farage back in front of the radio microphones and TV cameras \u2013 hasn\u2019t he retired to get his life back? \u2013 to accuse her of betraying Brexit voters.</p> <p>Second, it marked the conclusive arrival in the Brexit argument of a phrase that will soon start to haunt Mrs May unless and until she can deliver on it. The electorate voted to leave the EU, she said, because they wanted \u201csome control\u201d over migration from within the EU into the UK. Later, she varied it a little: \u201can element of control\u201d which could be delivered in \u201cvarious ways\u201d. Faraway in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Davis, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live\" title=\"\">in a generally anodyne statement on Brexit</a>, confirmed it yet again.</p> <p>If politics was a respectful process in which voters allowed a government the luxury of honing its positions on big issues over time, a phrase like this might not matter too much. Since politics does not work like that, however, and since immigration is a toxic issue, the phrase matters. By rejecting the points system Mrs May puts pressure on herself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/uk-immigration-what-are-the-alternatives-to-a-point-based-system\" title=\"\">to define the alternative</a>. This will matter to Brexit voters, many of whom cast their votes because of immigration, real and imaginary. Their wish was for a lot of control, not some. And it will matter to pro-Brexit press campaigners, full of self-confidence now, who know weasel words when they hear them. They will press the issue until Mrs May reveals how much control is some.</p> <p>Mrs May has made her own luck this year, with spectacular rewards. She had another piece of luck on Monday, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/05/junior-doctors-suspend-planned-five-day-strike-in-september\" title=\"\">junior doctors called off the first of their new waves of industrial action</a>, in a dispute on which Mrs May has been unbending. But she will need to tell a lot of people very soon <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37277412\" title=\"\">what she means by \u201csome control\u201d</a> if she is not to become a hostage to the ambiguity of the phrase. Mrs May said she would look at all forms of immigration, presumably including non-EU, before reaching a decision, while Mr Davis hinted that existing EU nationals in the UK would be able to stay. Nevertheless, a government that has staked its credibility on delivering Brexit, and that has put migration control at the top of its Brexit goals, is running a serious political risk if it does not come up pretty quickly with a solution that will satisfy its voters and activists.</p> <p>Important though it is, immigration is not the only issue here. Brexit is not a tactical issue. It is as large a strategic issue for the country as can be imagined in peacetime. As Mr Davis told MPs on Monday, even remain supporters have an interest in the government doing as good a job as circumstances permit. The increasing worry now, from both sides of the Brexit argument, is that Mrs May doesn\u2019t actually have a plan at all, and that she is pressing forward into the fog without a clear enough idea of her detailed goals. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing\u201d is a chant from the political terraces that would spell bad news for Mrs May.</p>",

It\u2019s time for some detail,\u201d said the MP who is backing the Open Britain group that has sprung out of the Remain campaign from the referendum. </p> <p>The negative response from pro-EU MPs came as Davis used his statement to parliament\u2019s first sitting since the summer break to say that it was natural for people to ask what Brexit would mean.<br></p> <p>\u201cSimply, it means the UK leaving the European Union. We will decide on our borders, our laws, and taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d he said, insisting that meant no attempt to \u201cdelay, frustrate or thwart the will of the British people\u201d and \u201cno attempt to engineer a second referendum because some people didn\u2019t like the first answer\u201d.</p> <p>However, he conceded that the talks did represent a considerable challenge. Arguing that he would seek to find a position that would be acceptable to Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales as well as to English councils and small and large businesses, Davis said he was seeking a \u201cunique to Britain and not an off-the-shelf solution ... This must mean controls on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe \u2013 but also a positive outcome for those who wish to trade in goods and services.\u201d</p> <p>Davis, who said his department now had 180 staff in London and 120 officials in Brussels, also set out some of the government\u2019s thinking around the negotiations, including that Theresa May would lead talks aimed at the UK regaining control of its laws, borders and money.<br></p> <p>He argued that Britain could be a \u201cbeacon for free trade across the world\u201d and a \u201cmore glorious country\u201d with an immigration system that controlled the numbers but also encouraged the \u201cbrightest and best\u201d to come. He suggested Britain could bring in an even more rigorous immigration system than a points-based system.</p> <p>He said his work would be driven by four key principles: to seek the national consensus; to put the national interest first and act in good faith towards European partners; to minimise uncertainty; and ultimately to leave the European Union.</p> <p>And he said parliament would be regularly \u201cinformed, updated and engaged\u201d but did not suggest any need for a vote to trigger article 50.</p> <p>Thornberry said the government had gone from \u201cgross negligence to rank incompetence\u201d when it came to preparing for the process of exiting the EU.

No points-based immigration system, no extra money for the NHS, but when will they tell us what they are going to do?\u201d</p> <p>Davis, who promised to hold roundtables with stakeholders in different sectors, also faced a difficult challenge from a Tory grandee. </p> <p>The former chancellor Ken Clarke said that while some \u201canti-foreigner rhetoric\u201d may have increased the leave vote, that was not the driving factor.

Domestic economic policies pursued by the government will be much more important for the British economy than whether the country retains access to the single market.

  "<p>After two hours walking through the camp in Calais, meeting refugee children who have crossed Europe alone, Alf Dubs is exhausted and feeling uncharacteristically despondent. \u201cIt is awful. I will have nightmares, and this is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Lord Dubs, the Labour peer who earlier this year masterminded a political coup forcing the government to promise to give sanctuary to some unaccompanied child refugees, usually comes across as an upbeat figure, not inclined to wallow in despair. Today he seems momentarily overwhelmed by the horrific situation facing about <a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.helprefugees.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/census-edit-kids.jpg\">860 children</a> living here in second-hand camping tents and flimsy wooden shacks. Given the amount of energy he has dedicated to trying to help them, and the complete absence of any progress to date, he has every reason to feel depressed.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a disgrace. A piece of legislation was passed with enormous public support, and the government has done nothing discernible about it,\u201d he says. As a former child refugee himself, brought to Britain from Czechoslovakia on one of the Kindertransport trains in 1939, his sense of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/27/peer-condemns-shocking-delays-over-help-for-unaccompanied-child-refugees\">anger at the political inaction</a> is particularly acute.</p> <p>After his intervention shamed Cameron\u2019s government into a U-turn, securing a commitment that Britain would give homes to some of the <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-minors-idUKKCN0XT15M\">estimated 88,000 child refugees</a> believed to be travelling through Europe, his amendment to the Immigration Act was widely celebrated as a rare sign of the government\u2019s humanity. Four months later, none of the qualifying children have arrived in the UK. Worse still, Dubs is dismayed to find, during a meeting with French officials, that there is no system in place for identifying and registering the children in order to see who might be eligible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dae2c72b36aaaf77636148356d3b1fdbc68c86e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dae2c72b36aaaf77636148356d3b1fdbc68c86e7/0_394_5913_3548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alf Dubs visits the Calais camp: \u2018No wonder they are so desperate to escape.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alf Dubs visits the Calais camp: \u2018No wonder they are so desperate to escape.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alecsandra Dragoi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His feelings of disappointment are nothing compared with those felt by the hundreds of children, some as young as eight, living here without parents or close relatives, many of whom have been stranded here, just a few hundred metres from Calais town centre and only 30 miles from England, since the end of last year.</p> <p>Ahead of his visit, volunteers ask some of the youngest children, potentially eligible for help under the \u201cDubs\u201d amendment, to meet him to help explain the urgency of the situation. Two cousins from Afghanistan, aged nine and 10, who left home more than a year ago and who have been in Calais for 10 months, were due to meet him. After months of trying to survive alone, attempting nightly to smuggle themselves into lorries to try to join an uncle in Britain, they are entirely crushed by their experiences and now mainly speak in reluctant monosyllables, occasionally offering a full sentence.</p> <p>The younger boy says (through a translator) that he had recently been hit on the knee with a rubber bullet fired by French police. His older cousin says they have tried more than 20 times in the past month to climb on to trucks. They look more unwell and more fragile than a month ago when I met them, their clothes grimier, and new scabs visible on the face of the younger boy.</p> <p>\u201cI lost my mind here. I don\u2019t remember anything I\u2019ve been doing,\u201d the older boy says. Pushed by the translator to say something else, he adds: \u201cWe ran away from war, and no one here has helped us ... Now the weather is getting colder.\u201d But he is not inclined to say much and tells the translator: \u201cThey ask too many questions, and they aren\u2019t doing anything.\u201d</p> <p>Another eight-year-old boy from Afghanistan, also left to fend for himself after the older relative he was travelling with succeeded in getting to England, is close to tears, and crouches on the sandy path, playing with stones and poking at the dirt with a stick. One of the volunteers who has worked with him says he feels suicidal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Immigration minister James \u00adBrokenshire \u00adacknowledged: 'We have a moral duty to help'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey need to leave the site now. They are on their own; they have been here through the winter and they are falling apart in front of us. There is no one here to put them to bed and sort their clothes. They are not functioning properly now. I can\u2019t believe that nobody in authority is here sorting this out. The British government has promised to help; the French aren\u2019t coping,\u201d says <a href=\"https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/junglewomenscentre\">Liz Clegg</a>, a volunteer from Devon who has spent much of the past year living on the camp, trying to make up for the absence of support from mainstream international agencies.</p> <p>She and other volunteers have devoted a lot of energy to trying to persuade children to apply for asylum in the France, and hundreds already have, but sometimes children are resistant to logic persuasion when they know their parents have gone heavily into debt, trying to get them to the UK; often they are trying to reach relatives.</p> <p>Visits from groups of politicians are always emotionally fraught because the children expect help to be forthcoming immediately, and find it hard to understand why nothing is done, Clegg says. She decides that these children are not up to speaking to Dubs, who is visiting alongside Vanessa Redgrave and her daughter Joely Richardson, and the Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy.</p> <p>Instead, Dubs has a private meeting in a wooden hut with three boys from Eritrea, aged between 13 and 16, who <a href=\"http://www.citizensuk.org/\">Citizens UK</a>, the campaign group which has been lobbying for Britain to help unaccompanied children, believe have a good case for being transferred to safety in Britain. Their names, along with those of the cousins from Afghanistan, were on a <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/02/home-secretary-urged-to-act-over-refugee-children-stuck-in-calais\">list of 387 refugee children</a> believed to be eligible under the amendment presented by Dubs to the Home Office on Friday.</p> <p>He leaves the meeting aware they need help urgently. \u201cI felt a terrible sense of hopeless despair on their behalf. They are clearly frightened of violence from older people; they don\u2019t feel safe,\u201d he says. Outside the hut, crowds of people gather to find out what help is on offer. \u201cThis boy is 14, what about him?\u201d one older camp residents shouts. \u201cCan you meet my friend who is 12?\u201d another asks.</p> <p>The problem facing campaigners such as Dubs is immense, and he acknowledges that it is a struggle not to feel overcome by the weight of responsibility.</p> <p>Fleetingly in May, it appeared that, regardless of political sensitivities around immigration, there was a consensus that something needed to done for the lone child refugees. With Save The Children estimating that there were 85,000 across Europe, politicians acknowledged that Britain had a responsibility to take its share of stranded children.</p> <p>Originally, the government rejected Dubs\u2019s amendment on the grounds that France, Greece and Italy are safe countries, until Dubs argued that there was a responsibility to share the burden between countries. The then immigration minister, James Brokenshire, acknowledged: \u201cWe have a moral duty to help.\u201d Even the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3562690/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-Mail-s-robust-migration-lost-children-sanctuary.html\">Daily Mail launched a campaign</a> to help the children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8566845e90a6a88a48107558cbd9445a4ab15ea7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8566845e90a6a88a48107558cbd9445a4ab15ea7/0_0_6016_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A nine-year-old boy in the Calais camp.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A nine-year-old boy in the Calais camp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The impetus got lost in the Brexit referendum, amid a hardening of attitudes on immigration. Local authorities with stretched budgets have yet to offer enough spaces to accommodate more asylum-seeking children. The situation in Calais is volatile and complex, and there is no simple solution. With the camp population now more than 9,000 and rising \u2013 higher than it has ever been \u2013 alarm among local people is mounting. The roads around the town this week are being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/travel-chaos-warning-as-french-farmers-and-truckers-plan-calais-camp-protest\">blockaded by French farmers</a>, truck drivers and residents, demanding that the government set a firm date for the camp to be cleared. The French government has said it will be gone by Christmas, but plans for the refugees are not clear.

But somehow the numbers are rising. Volunteers attempting to register the new unaccompanied children arriving in Calais note that numbers have jumped by about 100 in the past month, with more children coming from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Iraq, and greater numbers of unaccompanied girls.</p> <p>New reports documenting the dangers of the camp are published every week; on Monday <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk/Media-centre/Press-releases/Children-risking-their-lives-over-2000-times-a-week-to-reach-the-UK/\">Unicef research</a> suggested that the Calais refugee children were risking their lives 2,000 times a week to reach Britain, trying to stow away in lorries or jump on trains.</p> <p>The Home Office says it is in \u201cactive discussions\u201d with the UNHCR and Italian, Greek and French governments to \u201cspeed up mechanisms to identify, assess and transfer refugee children to the UK where this is in their best interests.\u201d But no children have come as a result of the Dubs commitment.</p> <p>\u201cI was shocked that nothing had happened despite the amendment. There are more people than ever, and the conditions are as awful as ever \u2013 children living in shacks, in tents very makeshift, with just one meal a day, often not enough to eat, with no support system except for the volunteers, left to their own devices,\u201d Dubs says.</p> <p>\u201cVisually, it is pretty awful, hemmed in, with barbed wire along the motorway; what it will be like in the cold and winter, I shudder to think.

Like the children in Calais, he had very little with him, a few clothes and a knapsack of food, (which he forgot to open on the journey \u2013 a sign, he thinks, of how traumatised he was).</p> <p>He only remembers the journey hazily. \u201cMy mother saw me off. I can see my mother with a friend at the station and a soldier with a swastika on the platform. When we got to the Dutch border, the older ones cheered. I had no idea, but they knew it meant something.\u201d Later, he remembers waiting at Liverpool Street station with a name tag around his neck, until his father (who had fled Prague a few months earlier) was allowed to take him back to a bed and breakfast where his father was staying in Belsize Park, north London.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a temptation to make up what you thought at the age of six; actually you don\u2019t remember much. I didn\u2019t know what was happening; I couldn\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t want to pretend I had a sensitivity or wisdom that I didn\u2019t have,\u201d he says. Nevertheless, he believes his experience has given him some understanding of how the unaccompanied children in Calais are feeling. \u201cSome of them were helped to flee by their parents or by traffickers, because they feared death, war, bombings \u2013 not totally different motivations from mine. I see them, and I see think there but for the grace of God ...\u201d</p> <p>He takes some inspiration from Winton\u2019s campaign. \u201cIt was a matter of luck that he was persuaded to give up a skiing holiday to go to Prague and he saw for himself what was happening. He set about working extremely hard to overcome the resistance of the British government and the suspicion of the Germans.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is not a place for living. The human is not created to live like this</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In some ways, it might have been easier for Winton, because \u201cimmigration wasn\u2019t the political issue on which the administration had staked its reputation\u201d, Dubs says. \u201cBut he took on the British authorities almost single-handedly and got them to agree. He was an exceptional individual who made things happen when a lesser person would not have bothered.\u201d</p> <p>Winton\u2019s MP was Theresa May, and Dubs met her first at his 103rd birthday party. While May was home secretary, he met her twice to talk about his amendment; the second time, under considerable political pressure, she agreed to include it in the immigration bill. He is uncertain about the strength of her ongoing commitment to the issue.</p> <p>In a wooden hut, set up by volunteers as a safe meeting space for the children travelling alone, a couple of dozen boys, mostly in their early teens, are waiting for food, half-watching a Bollywood film involving a flying taxi; some are curious about the visit from British politicians.</p> <p>Among them is 13-year-old Jawaad (not his real name) from Afghanistan, who learned English from his father, a Nato translator who has been pursued by the Taliban for working with western forces, and who has separately fled the country. \u201cIs it true that the government will pick up the right boys and take them legally?\u201d he asks, in careful, grammatically correct English.</p> <p>He says he his too tired and frightened to continue attempting to travel to the UK illegally. \u201cEvery second you are scared that something dangerous will happen to you. The French police, they are familiar with beating. When the police started beating dangerously, a lot of the underage boys stopped trying to go illegally. They don\u2019t care if you are a child or a grownup. They send dogs after us. The dog\u2019s mouth is covered but they can get you with their nails.\u201d</p> <p>He is clear about why Calais is not a suitable place for children travelling alone. \u201cFrom the time I arrived in Calais, I don\u2019t have a happy moment.

Calais is full of dangers and difficulties. When we want to take a shower, we cannot. We have no money for anything. When we want to call our parents, we are not able to. We have no relatives here.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a place for living. The human is not created to live like this. In my room in Afghanistan, I had electricity, I could study night and day. I had a beautiful bed, I slept comfortably. Here I have a tent. I have only a blanket, and the clothes I am sleeping in. When it is raining heavily sometimes the water comes inside the tent. Sometimes when you are late for the food, you will be hungry. At home, I never lived like this. It is too strange.\u201d</p> <p>Returning home would be extremely dangerous. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to back to Afghanistan. I couldn\u2019t be alive for a moment back there. The Taliban forced my father to leave his job. I don\u2019t know where he is now.\u201d</p> <p>Volunteers who have been trying to help the children, struggling without the support of international aid agencies, are jaundiced by the lack of progress on the \u201cDubs\u201d amendment. \u201cI\u2019d love to say I was surprised,\u201d says Karen Moynihan, who works with children in a youth centre on the camp. \u201cThere have been lots of politicians with good intentions, but, on the ground, very little has changed.\u201d</p> <p>Volunteers are becoming used to seeing children with cuts to their heads from falling off lorries, or complaining of having been sprayed in the face with pepper spray, she says. \u201cNow we just say: \u2018Are you OK?\u2019 It has become normalised. These are, without doubt, the most appalling conditions for young children to be living in.\u201d</p> <p>Dubs leaves the camp determined to keep fighting to ensure that at least some of the children are helped. \u201cThese kids are having a terrible time. There\u2019s no safety, no security. The situation we saw today is terrible.

  "<p>A year from now, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\" title=\"\">Germany</a> will be in the final stages of a general election that will shape European politics for the rest of this decade and beyond. With 12 months still to go, the question of whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a> will lead her centre-right CDU party into that election is the great unknown. Mrs Merkel has been chancellor for 11 years and is nearing the end of her third term. She is globally respected and generally popular with voters, but she cannot go on forever. Her handling of the refugee question has shaken up German politics and damaged (though in some quarters burnished) her mystique, causing speculation that the Merkel era may be nearing its end.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/mecklenburg-vorpommern-german-anti-immigrant-party-strong-regional-election-exit-polls-merkel\" title=\"\">The weekend elections</a> in Germany\u2019s most north-eastern region, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, were the latest lightning-rod for post-Merkel speculation, given a special twist by the fact that the chancellor herself sits for the region. <a href=\"http://wahl.tagesschau.de/wahlen/2016-09-04-LT-DE-MV/index.shtml\" title=\"\">The results on Sunday</a> were unquestionably bad for the CDU, whose vote fell by 4% from 23% to 19%, slipping into third place behind the centre-left SPD on 31% and the anti-migrant AfD on 21%. The region will continue to be governed by a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d of SPD and CDU, similar to the one that Mrs Merkel leads at federal level. Yet the setback has triggered the once unmentionable subject of the CDU adopting a&#xa0;new leader in time for the general election.</p> <p>Objectively, there is not much basis for such speculation. The 4% fall in the CDU share in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern does not, on its own, justify real panic. All major parties lost vote share on Sunday. The AfD\u2019s genuinely spectacular success has also been drawn from all parties, including from the Left party and the SPD. More enduringly, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not typical of Germany as a whole. It is one of the poorest regions in the country and formerly part of communist East Germany. Markedly the strongest vote for the AfD, moreover, <a href=\"http://wahlen.mvnet.de/dateien/atlanten/ergebnisse.2016/landtagswahl.html\" title=\"\">was in the extreme east</a>, the poorest part of all. It&#xa0;has been a long time since the former DDR was the CDU stronghold that it was in the aftermath of German reunification.</p> <p>It is of course true that the results in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern illustrate political trends that can be seen all over Europe, including Germany. Anti-migrant feeling has risen everywhere, as has racial tension. Dissatisfaction with national governments is widespread and hostility to the European Union has grown. But these trends take different and nuanced forms in each country and in each region of each country. Mrs Merkel is admired as well as disliked for her handling of the migrant situation. It is misleading to see everything in European domestic politics through the single prism of&#xa0;Brexit \u2013 or any other preoccupation.</p> <p>Nevertheless there is absolutely no doubt that this result will be weighed alongside those in the upcoming regional contests in Lower Saxony and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_state_election,_2016\" title=\"\">Berlin</a> to form a general view of Mrs Merkel\u2019s standing as the general election draws nearer. Nor is there much doubt that a politician who has dominated her country for so long will eventually and rightly come under pressure from a new generation.

He replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Access to the single market is not really up for grabs. It is there for everybody. There are many, many countries, many countries outside the European Union, that do a better job, frankly, of exporting to the single market than we do, even without a trade arrangement. So of course we want to have access to the single market. We don\u2019t need to be a member of it to do it. Indeed, being a member of it has caused some of the problems of sovereignty that this referendum was driven by.</p> </blockquote> <p>Later, when the pro-European Tory<strong> Anna Soubry</strong> asked Davis to confirm that he was willing to abandon single market membership, Davis replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I\u2019m saying is that this government is looking at every option. But the simple truth is that if a requirement of membership is giving up control of our borders, I think that makes it very improbable.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Davis said he did not accept the claim that there was a trade off between getting control of immigration and protecting free trade by remaining in the single market.</strong> It was a false choice, he argued, because it was in the interests of both sides to promote free trade. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57cd9281e4b01f3b27891895#block-57cd9281e4b01f3b27891895\"> 4.46pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government\u2019s post-Brexit immigration system would be \u201cmore rigorous\u201d than a points-based system. </strong>He said Theresa May was \u201cvery clear\u201d in her comments in China earlier.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>She was concerned that a points-based system was too open-ended, that it did not actually put a control on the number of people coming to the UK. And therefore she wanted something which sounded like it would be more rigorous not less.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he would oppose any attempt to undermine workers\u2019 rights as part of the Brexit settlement.</strong> He said this in response to a question from Labour\u2019s<strong> Angela Eagle</strong> (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57cd9736e4b01f3b278918ba#block-57cd9736e4b01f3b278918ba\">5.05pm)</a> using language very similar to that he used<a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2016/07/david-davis-trade-deals-tax-cuts-and-taking-time-before-triggering-article-50-a-brexit-economic-strategy-for-britain.html\"> in his ConservativeHome article in July. </a>In that article he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The great British industrial working classes voted overwhelmingly for Brexit. I am not at all attracted by the idea of rewarding them by cutting their rights. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government would have to decide whether or not it wanted to remain part of the European customs union before invoking article 50, starting the formal EU withdrawal process. </strong>(See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57cd9a6ee4b01f3b278918c7#block-57cd9a6ee4b01f3b278918c7\"> 5.20pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He refused to say whether the UK would remain part of Europol.</strong> Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper asked this. Davis said the government wanted to preserve the relationship with the EU on security matters as best we can. He went on: \u201cOf course we are aiming to maintain that. And that\u2019s the answer.\u201d But he seemed to be making a general point, not answering the specific question about Europol. That is how Cooper interpreted his answer.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YvetteCooperMP/status/772827185128280064\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Asked if Gov had made decision on whether we shd stay in Europol (fundamental for fighting crime &amp; trafficking).

First, as I said, we wish to build a national consensus around our position. Second, while always putting the national interest first, we will always act in good faith towards our European partners. Third, wherever possible we will try to minimise any uncertainty that change can inevitably bring. And, fourth, crucially, we will \u2013 by the end of this process \u2013 have left the European Union, and put the sovereignty and supremacy of this parliament beyond doubt.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57cdaacae4b01f3b278918f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-05T17:27:41.601Z\">6.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>David Davis</strong> has just finished taking questions.

I will probably be writing that sentence again after David Davis\u2019s Commons statement, and probably quite regularly for the rest of the decade. In truth May and her team may have little idea what the final Brexit settlement will look like and, as they try to craft a deal acceptable to both Nigel Farage, the CBI and the EU, the outcome is likely to emerge slowly and haphazardly. (That\u2019s why <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasongroves1/status/745278844135931904\">David Cameron once said a Brexit vote would mean \u201cthree years of Euro-wank.)</a></p> <p> But some of May\u2019s comments were moderately revealing. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>May said that leaving the EU would give the UK \u201csome control\u201d over EU migration - suggesting that the restrictions on EU migration might just be partial.</strong> She said that at present the UK could not restrict EU migration. She went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we will now have an ability to do, which we haven\u2019t had before, is when we come out of the EU, we will be able to have some control on movement of people coming from the EU into the UK, which of course was one element over which we weren\u2019t able to have control before. </p> </blockquote> <p>It is not entirely clear what May meant, but hardline anti-Europeans like Nigel Farage (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57cd2b09e4b01f3b278917b0#block-57cd2b09e4b01f3b278917b0\">9.33am)</a> are likely to be worried by her tone. My colleague <strong>Alan Travis </strong>says this could be a hint that free movement could remain for EU citizens with job offers in the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/alantravis40/status/772767292937625600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">May says she wants to &quot;gain an element of control&quot; over immigration.

She explained her point with a story about what she learnt when she visited Heathrow to speak to Border Force staff with David Cameron after they took office.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And we talked to Border Force officers there. And we said to them, \u2018What\u2019s the most important thing that we can focus on?\u2019 And they said, \u2018You need to look at the issue of students who come here, who appear to have met the criteria, they don\u2019t speak English, they don\u2019t know which institution they are going to and they don\u2019t know what course it is they\u2019re doing\u2019. So the system is being abused. But because they met the criteria, they were automatically allowed in. And that\u2019s the problem with the points-based system. I want a system when the government is able to decide who comes into the country. I think that\u2019s what the British people want. A points-based system means that people come in automatically if they just meet the criteria.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked what alternative system the government would adopt post-Brexit, May said there were \u201cvarious ways\u201d for the government to assert control over migration into the UK. \u201cWe will be coming forward in due course with proposals,\u201d she said. </p> <ul> <li><strong>She hinted that she had lost confidence in Keith Vaz as chair of the Commons home affairs committee.</strong> Asked about his conduct she replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What Keith does is for Keith and any decisions he wishes to make are for him. But I think overall what people look for is confidence in their politicians.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She reaffirmed her commitment to make the UK \u201cthe global leader in free trade\u201d and she said she had been encouraged by how many world leaders were interested in striking trade deals with the UK.</strong> She said India, Mexico, South Korea and Singapore had all expressed an interest in removing barriers to trade. And she said Australian trade minister to visit UK this week to for \u201cexploratory discussions\u201d on UK/Australia trade deal.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said she would be chairing a meeting of the cabinet committee on Brexit and international trade later this week to discuss which markets to prioritise.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She sidestepped a question about whether she had been able to reassure Japan on any of the Brexit demands it is making on behalf of Japanese firms based in the UK.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said the government would publish a consultation paper on tackling corporate irresponsibility in the autumn.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To restore greater fairness, we will bring forward a consultation this autumn on measures to tackle corporate irresponsibility: cracking down on excessive corporate pay and poor corporate governance and giving employees and customers representation on company boards.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24f62dd2e18313d808b3d63c5850ba964d2ed0e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24f62dd2e18313d808b3d63c5850ba964d2ed0e1/0_256_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May gestures at her press conference after the G20 Summit at the Hangzhou International Expo Centre in Hangzhou, China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May gestures at her press conference after the G20 Summit at the Hangzhou International Expo Centre in Hangzhou, China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: How Hwee Young/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-05T13:49:31.259Z\">at 2.49pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57cd5fafe4b01f3b2789182c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-05T12:07:07.500Z\">1.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are Theresa May\u2019s comments on Keith Vaz.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MrHarryCole/status/772765652956372992\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">PM twists the knife on Vaz - they have history don&#39;t forget. <a href=\"https://t.co/JqglJUigHV\">pic.twitter.com/JqglJUigHV</a></p>&mdash; Harry Cole (@MrHarryCole) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrHarryCole/status/772765652956372992\">September 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And here is the Mirror\u2019s Kevin Maguire on what she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Kevin_Maguire/status/772764744050741248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That was a text book knifing of Keith Vaz by Theresa May</p>&mdash; Kevin Maguire (@Kevin_Maguire) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kevin_Maguire/status/772764744050741248\">September 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><em>UPDATE: </em>Here\u2019s another tweet on this from Maguire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Kevin_Maguire/status/772766354948628480\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hard to see how Keith Vaz can survive as Home Affairs chair after Theresa May knifed him: 6 members Con, 4 Lab(incl Vaz) + 1 SNP</p>&mdash; Kevin Maguire (@Kevin_Maguire) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kevin_Maguire/status/772766354948628480\">September 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-05T12:22:25.214Z\">at 1.22pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57cd5cc8e4b0c2a396c06dcd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-05T11:56:09.461Z\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: Will you be able to sort out Brexit in two years?

  "<p>Britain\u2019s services sector enjoyed a record rise last month, as companies shrugged off the initial shock of the vote to leave the EU, according to a survey of business activity that adds to signs the economy has escaped recession in the immediate aftermath of the referendum.</p> <p>The<a href=\"https://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey/PressRelease.mvc/3de4f3638ea3472bb7b986ebe0b9931d\"> Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index </a> (pdf) for August rose to 52.9 after slumping to 47.4 for July following the vote to leave the EU, well above the 50 mark that indicates growth. That was the biggest month-to-month jump in the survey\u2019s 20-year history and followed the biggest drop on record the previous month when businesses were coming to terms with the outcome of June\u2019s referendum.</p> <p>Economists had expected August\u2019s survey to rise to 50, indicating that activity has been flat for a sector which makes up almost four-fifths of the UK economy. The services PMI excludes government services and retail but still covers half of the overall services sector. The surprise surge helped push the pound to a seven-week high against the dollar of $1.3375.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-05T15:51:07/embed.html\" data-alt=\"UK services sector\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-05T15:51:07/embed.html\">UK services sector</a> <figcaption>UK services sector.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The services sector includes hairdressers and restaurants as well as banking and accountancy. </p> <p>The services report follows news of a similar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/uk-factories-bounce-back-brexit-shock-eu-referendum-manufacturing-sector\">rebound in the manufacturing sector</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/02/uk-construction-sector-output-better-than-expected-in-august-markit-cips\">more modest improvement in the construction sector</a> last week. Taken with signs of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/18/uk-retail-sales-rise-july-shoppers-shrug-off-brexit-gloom\">recovery in consumer confidence and high street spending</a>, it will allay fears that economic growth is grinding to a halt after the referendum. </p> <p>IHS Markit, the compilers of the PMI reports on manufacturing, services and construction said that they suggested the economy will have managed to eke out some growth in the July-to-September quarter that followed the Brexit vote.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe UK saw business activity rebound from July\u2019s post-referendum decline in August, enjoying the strongest expansion for five months,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.</p> <p>There was a record rise in the Markit/CIPS all-sector PMI to 53.2 in August, its highest since March, more than reversing the record fall to 47.4 seen in July.<br></p> <p>\u201cAssuming further growth is signalled by the September PMI surveys, we expect the economy to have eked out a modest GDP expansion of 0.1% in the third quarter,\u201d said Williamson.</p> <p>\u201cWhile there\u2019s clearly been a sharp slowing in the pace of economic growth in the third quarter, the risk of imminent recession has fallen significantly, attributable in part to renewed stimulus from the Bank of England as well as the calming of uncertainty brought about by the swift introduction of the new government.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5131798a46c262ec113e75262d48d5034f37705\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5131798a46c262ec113e75262d48d5034f37705/0_0_506_371/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK PMI and GDP compared.\" width=\"500\" height=\"367\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK PMI and GDP compared.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IHS Markit, CIPS, ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The improvement in companies\u2019 new business and output followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">an interest rate cut by the Bank of England to a new record low of 0.25% in early August</a>. Businesses also said they had been helped by a weak pound, which fell sharply after the referendum, making UK exports more competitive and attracting foreign tourists to the UK on shopping sprees.</p> <p>But there was also evidence the weak pound was stoking inflation by raising import costs. The PMI report showed input price inflation accelerated to a 33-month high in August, linked to the weak pound and rising fuel and labour costs. Subsequently, service providers raised their own prices at the sharpest rate since January 2014. </p> <p>Economists warn that despite a post-referendum bounce in activity, the decision to leave the EU could be felt more acutely once negotiations to leave the bloc begin in earnest. There are also signs that companies are nervous about hiring and investing as they await more clarity on future trading relationships and immigration rules.</p> <p>The services report showed business confidence, although improving on July\u2019s multi-year low, remained well below its long-run trend. </p> <p>\u201cMany companies remain cautious about the outlook, suggesting that political and economic uncertainty is likely to prevail in coming months, subduing growth. It therefore remains far too early to say whether August\u2019s upturn is a dead-cat bounce or the start of a sustained post-referendum recovery,\u201d said Williamson.</p> <p>Other economists also said the August news should be treated with caution.</p> <p>\u201cJust as the July survey probably overstated the economy\u2019s underlying weakness, the August survey probably overstates its subsequent recovery,\u201d said Scott Bowman at the consultancy Capital Economics.</p> <p>\u201cWe think an average of the July and August surveys paints a more accurate picture of the economy post-Brexit. And this is consistent with quarterly GDP growth of close to zero \u2013 in line with our forecast for the third quarter as a whole.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2016/008.aspx\">Bank of England policymakers have already hinted they will cut interest rates again before the end of the year</a>. Few expect another rate reduction at next week\u2019s policy meeting, but many economists predict the monetary policy committee will move rates again in November and take borrowing costs close to zero.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s improvements are in line with the string of robust economic figures we\u2019ve seen throughout August. But, while there is some reason for optimism today, it\u2019s still too early to conclude that the UK has escaped the Brexit vote unscathed,\u201d said Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management.</p> <p>\u201cNow that we\u2019ve seen some resilience in the UK economy, many are questioning whether last month\u2019s monetary policy committee decision was the right one. We believe the Bank of England has taken the correct course of action and expect them to ease further before the year is out.\u201d<br></p> <p></p>",

Three EU countries at the summit are not allowed to enter such negotiations outside the bloc.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live\">Theresa May promises only 'some control' over EU migration post-Brexit - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p> After meetings with almost every world leader at the G20, May said it had been a successful summit at which she pitched the UK as a global leader in free trade and saw others echo her warnings that some people felt left behind by globalisation.</p> <p>However, the UK prime minister has also had to endure some difficult discussions about the consequences of Brexit. After her first bilateral meeting with Barack Obama, May was warned that the US wanted to focus on trade negotiations with the EU and a bloc of Pacific nations before considering a deal with the UK.</p> <p> This was swiftly followed by a message from Japan that there could be a string of corporate exits from Britain unless some of the privileges that come with access to the single market are maintained. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, told May he <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/japanese-ambassador-warns-companies-could-leave-uk-over-brexit\">wanted more certainty</a> about what Brexit would look like for Japanese companies that invest in the UK.</p> <p> May still faces a testing meeting with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, on Monday, at which she will tell him there has been no decision yet on whether to let China invest in UK nuclear power.</p> <p> In a hint that she is contemplating Britain\u2019s nuclear future without Chinese involvement, she said: \u201cOur relationship with China is about more than Hinkley Point.\u201d </p> <p>An official UK government source said this did not mean a decision had been made on whether plans for a new plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset should go ahead.</p> <p> May\u2019s reticence about Chinese investment in British nuclear power has been interpreted as a sign that she is more cautious about the so-called golden era of relations with Beijing heralded by David Cameron during Xi\u2019s state visit last year.</p> <p> However, May said there would still be a \u201cgolden era\u201d and strong partnership with Beijing. Her meeting on Monday with Xi is expected to last about half an hour.</p> <p> May angered Beijing by placing the French and Chinese-backed Hinkley nuclear project under review in July, apparently over security concerns. Since then there has been a suggestion that she could be happy for the Chinese to be a passive investor in Hinkley but does not want the country to have a more active role in developing a new plant at Sizewell in Suffolk or Bradwell in Essex.</p> <p> On the way to Hangzhou, May gave an unclear answer about whether she trusted the Chinese. \u201cOf course we have a relationship with them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are working with them. And we have seen significant Chinese investment into the United Kingdom. What I want to do is build on that relationship. But I also want to be able to build on relationships with other countries. I want to be unashamedly open to free trade and a global leader in free trade.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/05/theresa-may-promises-some-control-over-eu-migration-post-brexit-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xzby\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2694702\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May promises 'some control' over EU migration post-Brexit \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57cd683fe4b0456abb93da6a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/05/160905Mayimmigration2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/05/160905Mayimmigration2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846421&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/05/theresa-may-promises-some-control-over-eu-migration-post-brexit-video\">Theresa May promises \u2018some control\u2019 over EU migration post-Brexit</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>May was forced to insist that Britain still had clout at the G20 in the wake of warnings from remain campaigners that Brexit would cause the UK to lose status on the international stage.</p> <p> In Hangzhou, the UK has been excluded from some joint meetings involving EU leaders from France, Germany and Italy.

  "<p></p> <p>The mayor of Melania Trump\u2019s hometown is embarrassed. </p> <p>At 47, Sre\u010dko Ocvirk is just a year older than the world\u2019s most famous Slovenian. But even though he was a schoolmate of hers, the mayor of Sevnica said: \u201cI have to be honest, I cannot place her. In those days, Sevnica primary school had a lot of pupils,\u201d he added sheepishly. </p> <p>Born in 1970 to a textile worker and a car spares trader, Melania Trump has lived a life \u2013 judging by what is known of it \u2013 that could be romanced into that of a phoenix risen from the belching smokestacks of Tito\u2019s Yugoslavia. But the Trump campaign has opted not to go down that route. </p> <p>On a tour of Sevnica, a pretty medieval town that clings to vine-clad hills rising from the Sava river, it quickly becomes clear that the young Melanija Knavs did not stand out from the collective consciousness of the time as someone who would rise to global fame.</p> <p>\u201cIn the socialist days we were all the same,\u201d said a woman in the same age bracket as the 46-year-old. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b9aebd064cf688e8b3df6e66ea7f37e2a4ee644\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b9aebd064cf688e8b3df6e66ea7f37e2a4ee644/0_0_1030_684/1000.jpg\" alt=\"melania trump slovenia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sevnica, the small Slovenian town where Melania Trump is from.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tanja Zibert/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By contrast, other residents can seem to make too much of an effort to recall her youth. At the Rondo Pizzeria, a couple of diners seem suspiciously well informed about the supposed early knitting abilities of Trump\u2019s future wife. At the market, a tomato seller named Matej said Melanija wrapped her schoolbooks with pages torn from Italian fashion magazines \u2013 only to confess that he learnt that detail from a recent television report.</p> <p>Not only are clues sparse as to Melania\u2019s transformation from model to the Republican presidential candidate\u2019s third wife, but few residents seem to hold strong opinions about her life, her immigration status or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/melania-trump-daily-mail-lawsuit\">the libel lawsuits pending over her references to her pre-Trump past</a>. No one in Sevnica can even confirm the oft-reported tidbit that Melanija\u2019s maternal grandfather developed a red onion variety, the Raka. </p> <p>\u201cSevnica was very different in the 1970s,\u201d said Ocvirk. \u201cIt was a young town, made up of people moving in from the rural areas.</p> <p>\u201cThey worked in large numbers at two or three factories, mainly making clothes and shoes. They shopped in Italy and Austria and tried to achieve the living standards of those countries,\u2019\u2019 said the mayor, a Sevnica-born agricultural engineer who was elected eight years ago. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b407bb8a0933f8a6e8575b9b5d60ec2b5f345f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b407bb8a0933f8a6e8575b9b5d60ec2b5f345f0/0_96_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"melania trump slovenia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sre\u010dko Ocvirk, mayor of Sevnica.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Duval Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among the incomers who built the town\u2019s industrial base were Viktor and Amalija Knavs and their daughters Ines and Melanija. Businessman Viktor dealt in cars or spare parts or both \u2013 no one seems quite sure. Amalija was a pattern cutter at the Jutranjka childrenswear factory and may at some point have gained a promotion to pattern designer. </p> <p>They lived in a five-storey block in the Naselje Heroja Maroka area. Later, Melanija and her older sister went to high school in Ljubljana, 60 miles away, and their parents built themselves a white villa in the pretty hills above the town, far away from the hourly clatter-past of the train. They still own the house but are rarely there, living instead in New York and helping look after Donald and Melania\u2019s son, Barron.</p> <p>The block where Melania once lived has been painted in mellow peach tones. The climbing frame in the playground is Lego green. The splashes of colour are townscape hallmarks of central European countries such as Slovenia that received development funds after joining the EU in 2004. Even the school bears no resemblance to the one Melania attended. With EU funds, it was rebuilt last year, to the annoyance of visiting television crews determined to see her locker. </p> <p>Trainee nurse Drita Mustafai, 21, knows nothing about Melania Trump, but says she \u201ccan only be a good thing for Sevnica. It is a lovely town which deserves more tourists\u201d.</p> <p>Mustafai helps out at her father\u2019s ice-cream stand and works in a hotel to help pay for her studies, and hopes to move to Germany when she graduates, because wages are better.</p> <p>Among Sevnica\u2019s 5,000-population, unemployment is 10.3% \u2013 roughly the national average. Jutranjka, where Amalija Knavs worked, is no more. Lisca, a lingerie brand named after the local mountain, survives, along with a shoe factory and a furniture company. But they employ fewer than 1,000 people between them. Many residents drive more than an hour to the capital Ljubljana to work.</p> <p>Asked what Donald Trump could do for his wife\u2019s home town, Ocvirk ruled out a skyscraper as \u201cunsuited to our natural beauty\u201d.

  "<p>I must commend this terrific analysis by a former Sunday Times colleague, Liz Gerard, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.sub-scribe.co.uk/2016/09/the-press-and-immigration-reporting.html\">The press and immigration: reporting the news or fanning the flames of hatred?</a>\u201d</p> <p>It runs to almost 3,500 words and makes for uncomfortable reading. But journalists should make the effort because it is a factual account of truly industrial-scale misreporting and misrepresentation.</p> <p>Her meticulous research, complemented by reproductions of front pages and statistical graphs, is a fine piece of work, worthy of being a Phd proposal.</p> <p>By looking back to the coverage of immigration since the May 2010 general election, she has been able to reveal a disturbing pattern of wholly negative articles about refugees seeking asylum in Britain.<br></p> <p>The worst culprits were the Daily Express, which splashed on migration issues on 179 occasions, and the Daily Mail, with 122 splashes. She writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThe Sun and Star see footballers and reality TV stars as better sellers, but are generally hostile [to immigration]. The Telegraph is not quite as fevered as the white-top tabloids, but shares their outlook. </p> <p>The Guardian, i and Independent are all generally sympathetic, while the Times tries to steer a middle course.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>As for the Daily Mirror, it is \u201cthe one paper that has shunned front-page stories about migration\u201d. </p> <p>Recognising that \u201cthere is a groundswell of opinion that something needs to happen to stop this dangerous drip-feed of negative headlines\u201d, Gerard asks: what is to be done?</p> <p>Her first approach was to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), only to discover that it avoids getting involved in what might be termed \u201cgeneral\u201d complaints. </p> <p>As for the alternative regulator, Impress, which has yet to finalise its code of conduct, its complaints officer \u201cwas hopeful that the end product would be strong enough to tackle such drip-feed effects.\u201d But it transpired that Impress, like Ipso, is wary of dealing with complaints \u201cbased on a collection of articles.\u201d</p> <p>There is more, much more, to appreciate in her article. And she promises yet more in future. </p> <p>Let me finish with one of the examples turned up by Gerard that illustrates how the Express, in its desperation to publish anti-migrant material, happily regurgitates \u201cnews\u201d stories.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"741bb71ea0e84a5bc12e9c210fd5628a9751db86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/741bb71ea0e84a5bc12e9c210fd5628a9751db86/0_0_416_520/400.jpg\" alt=\"Daily Express, 23 November 2010.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daily Express, 23 November 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clipshare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 23 November 2010, it carried a splash \u201cA gypsy\u2019s mansion built on benefits\u201d with an inside spread showing two pictures of the alleged house.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5fe2277c48147884711c47ee786da8d383a8a321\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fe2277c48147884711c47ee786da8d383a8a321/0_9_422_527/400.jpg\" alt=\"Daily Express, 30 March 2016.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daily Express, 30 March 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clipshare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 30 March 2016, the Express ran \u201cYou pay for Roma gypsy palaces\u201d with an inside spread also carrying two pictures.</p> <p>Gerard writes: \u201cDoesn\u2019t the house and its interior look familiar?\u201d Indeed they do. </p> <p>The second use in the Express was doubtless prompted by a Sun spread (\u201cDun Roma-ing\u201d) the day before.

Men (and women) from all walks of life. I don\u2019t like the thought of it any more than you probably do, but I don\u2019t have the luxury of pretending it doesn\u2019t happen. It does. As a former escort, I\u2019ve lived it. I\u2019ve entertained men who, when the fun has ended, call their wives to tell them they\u2019re off to pick the kids up from school.

What two consenting adults agree to do together is up to them. Trying to \u201cend demand\u201d \u2013 which is never going to work anyway \u2013 only puts sex workers at greater risk.

I haven\u2019t been exploited or abused and I resent middle-class know-it-alls trying to define my life choices. Back in May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/10/belle-de-jour-author-mps-prostitution-laws-brooke-magnanti\">I spoke at the home affairs select committee</a> on Britain\u2019s sex work laws, where Keith Vaz rather condescendingly told me he \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe\u201d I\u2019d never met a sex worker who had been forced in to it. I haven\u2019t. For most people it\u2019s just a job. I know people who\u2019ve done it once or twice when they needed a bit of extra cash, and others purely for the thrill. That\u2019s right. Sex work can be fun. Exciting. Lucrative. And, believe it or not, sane adults can and do choose to do it of their own free will.</p> <p>Banning all sex work because of sexual exploitation is like banning all factories because of a handful of sweatshops. The difference between a willing sex worker and someone who has been forced to do it is the difference between a cleaner and a slave. We managed to explain this important distinction to the committee, but it wasn\u2019t easy. Let me be clear: from start to finish, the committee was heavily skewed towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/dec/11/uk-nordic-model-prostitution-clients-buyer-sex\">the Nordic model</a> of criminalising those who buy sex rather than those who sell it. Yes, Vaz is a hypocrite if the claims about him are true, but that does not change the committee\u2019s important findings that criminalising sex work puts sex workers in danger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7a575d8ab0c47b0724d49422ba3be9f61b67f9e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a575d8ab0c47b0724d49422ba3be9f61b67f9e0/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Peter Tatchell\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/petertatchell\">Peter Tatchell</a>: \u2018There is no contradiction between Vaz\u2019s public pronouncements and private behaviour\u2019</h2> <p>Keith Vaz may have behaved recklessly and said some ill-advised things. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s blameless. But as far as we know he has not committed any crime and is not guilty of hypocrisy.</p> <p>Buying sex is not an offence, the men were consenting adults, there was no use of cocaine and poppers are legal. Vaz has supported gay equality and the decriminalisation of sex work. There is no contradiction between his public pronouncements and his private behaviour.</p> <p>So where is the public interest in outing him? This looks like a classic tabloid sting perpetrated by the Sunday Mirror for sensationalist motives in order to boost sales. The whole scenario may have been set up by the newspaper in collusion with the escorts, in order to entrap the MP. This could even include the paper assisting with the recording equipment and laying in wait outside the flat where the rendezvous with Vaz took place (although the paper denies this). It may even have prompted the escorts to ask Vaz leading questions about drugs. The Sunday Mirror allegedly paid the escorts \u00a330,000.</p> <p>This was not about defending the public interest. It looks like a sordid money-making conspiracy by the newspaper and the escorts \u2013 a throwback to the squalid tabloid excesses of the 1980s. To establish the truth, the Sunday Mirror must come clean about whether it knew in advance about the escorts meeting Vaz and whether it collaborated with them. How much did the paper pay the escorts for their story? Was there a signed contract? If so will the paper now publish it?</p> <p>Given the absence of any public interest justification, there is prima facie evidence that the Sunday Mirror has broken the press regulation code prohibiting unwarranted intrusion into privacy.</p> <p>It said that Vaz failed to declare an interest when his home affairs committee was investigating a ban on poppers and sex work criminalisation (he opposed both). Perhaps he should have declared an interest, but I am not sure that his failure to do so is a major lapse. After all, we don\u2019t demand that MPs who drink and smoke declare an interest when they discuss legislation affecting the alcohol and cigarette industries. There is never any insistence that MPs who have pension plans step aside from committees discussing pension regulation or that gay MPs must come out and declare themselves before voting on gay issues. I sense a whiff of double standards.</p> <p>Finally, I sympathise with Vaz\u2019s wife and children. Perhaps they never knew. But we must also remember how difficult it is for gay and bisexual people to come out in some sections (not all) of the Asian community. Homophobia kept Keith Vaz in the closet and we should be angry about that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"30806a87833875ab9c8b4c2b0fdcfb5526e8ebe9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30806a87833875ab9c8b4c2b0fdcfb5526e8ebe9/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Julie Bindel\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/juliebindel\">Julie Bindel</a>: \u2018If Vaz is a sex buyer, how can he not have a stake in the committee\u2019s findings?\u2019</h2> <p>As predicted, the boys are out to defend Keith Vaz. <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/keith-vaz-prostitution-scandal-is-a-private-matter-says-jeremy-corbyn-a3336496.html\">Jeremy Corbyn has said</a> that the scandal is a \u201cprivate matter\u201d.

In its <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/home-affairs-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/prostitution/\">recent interim report</a>, the committee stated that it is \u201cnot yet persuaded that the sex buyer law is effective in reducing, rather than simply displacing, demand for prostitution\u201d. If the Nordic model was applied in England and Wales, those engaged in activities such as those Vaz is alleged to have partaken in would face criminal sanctions. If Vaz is himself a sex buyer, how can he not have a stake in these findings?</p> <p>The current law is that criminal charges can be brought if a person pays for sex with somebody who is \u201ccontrolled for another person\u2019s gain\u201d. Significant numbers of women and smaller numbers of men in the UK have been coerced into the sex trade, including those from poor and developing countries. To argue that Vaz, if he has paid for sex, can continue as chair of the very committee that will soon decide whether or not sex buyers should be criminalised is ludicrous. Vaz should step down now, and the interim report be scrapped and rewritten once the new chair is appointed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"77d1edda41627f2cf86418c0b9bba776c1490c8d\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/09/05/Margaret_Corvid_opt.png\" alt=\"Margaret Corvid\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/margaret-corvid\">Margaret Corvid</a>: \u2018Prurient interest must not derail the chance for sex workers to live free from fear and stigma\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m no fan of Keith Vaz, but when I read that he\u2019d been accused of hiring male sex workers, I knew that defending him isn\u2019t about him \u2013 it\u2019s about our right as sex workers to work without threat of violence and arrest.</p> <p>The papers call him a hypocrite for alleged gay sex and for hiring sex workers when he\u2019s chaired a <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/home-affairs-committee/news-parliament-2015/prostitution-report-published-16-17/\">parliamentary committee investigating the sex work laws</a>.

For the closeted, sex workers provide discretion: that discretion may have been violated by a newspaper sting, and disclosure rains down hurt upon Vaz\u2019s family, party and the essential work of the home affairs select committee. And if there was a sting, it makes <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/SexWorkerOU/status/772345591330406400\">sex workers less safe</a>, because potential clients are less likely to go through our screening procedures when they fear exposure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/sep/05/why-the-sunday-mirror-was-justified-in-exposing-keith-vaz\">Why the Sunday Mirror was justified in exposing Keith Vaz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The committee has been investigating whether sex work should be fully decriminalised, as in New Zealand. Its groundbreaking inquiry heard testimony from current and former sex workers, receiving written submissions from hundreds of us, who asserted, in accord with the most rigorous research, that decriminalisation would drastically improve our safety and health, letting us work together and letting us go to police when we\u2019re robbed or assaulted, rather than fearing they will mock, arrest or deport us.</p> <p>The committee <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/home-affairs-committee/news-parliament-2015/prostitution-report-published-16-17/\">recommended the decriminalisation of sex workers</a> working together for safety; those recommendations were not the result of Vaz\u2019s alleged lusts. They emerged from a multi-party inquiry based on scientific evidence and the testimony of those affected most by criminalisation. Whether Vaz stays or goes, we must not let prurient interest in his personal life derail this precious moment \u2013 this chance for sex workers in the UK to live a life free from fear and stigma. The committee\u2019s recommendation for decriminalisation must stand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b40ba57e6b8b3d9ab96e9749d03bf4df92f5f55a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b40ba57e6b8b3d9ab96e9749d03bf4df92f5f55a/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Joan Smith\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/joansmith\">Joan Smith</a>: \u2018It\u2019s hard to think of a more blatant conflict of interest\u2019</h2> <p>Public attitudes to prostitution are changing. In Sweden, where what\u2019s known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/dec/11/prostitution-sweden-model-reform-men-pay-sex\">the Nordic model of prostitution policy</a> was first introduced, a majority of the public now regards paying for sex as a form of abuse. Women and men who sell sex no longer face criminal sanctions but, crucially, people who buy it do.</p> <p>In this country, we still have out-of-date laws that criminalise vulnerable individuals who are in reality victims of a vast commercial sex industry. That\u2019s one of the reasons why many of us would like to see a sex buyers\u2019 law introduced in the UK, forcing men who drive this trade (and it is mostly men) to face up to their responsibilities.</p> <p>The Labour MP Keith Vaz chairs a powerful House of Commons committee that has been holding an inquiry into this key area of public policy. It has heard evidence from a number of organisations that support the Nordic model, yet no one knew that a change in the law may \u2013 if the <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/married-mp-keith-vaz-tells-8763805\">allegations in the Sunday Mirror</a> are true \u2013 affect the committee\u2019s chair directly.</p> <p>That\u2019s why these claims, no matter how luridly they have been presented, are in a different category from other stories exposing the private activities of well-known people. To take a recent example, the argument for publishing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/13/mp-john-whittingdale-had-relationship-with-sex-worker\">details of the sexual relationships of the former culture secretary, John Whittingdale</a>, was undermined by the fact that there was no clear evidence they had affected the way he did his job.</p> <p>Vaz\u2019s situation is very different from Whittingdale\u2019s.

  "<p>Theresa May has ruled out a points-based immigration system supported by the official Brexit campaign, while promising a more effective way of bringing \u201csome control\u201d over the number of people coming to the UK.</p> <p>The prime minister was accused of backsliding on promises made by Vote Leave after she <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/04/theresa-may-refuses-to-guarantee-brexit-pledges-on-immigration-and-nhs\">cast doubt on the effectiveness</a> of a system admitting people on the basis of their skills and refused to commit an extra \u00a3100m to the NHS.</p> <p>Speaking at a press conference on Monday at the G20, May insisted that she opposed a points-based system because it did not give the government enough of a say over who comes to Britain. Shaking her head at the claim that she was going soft on controlling immigration, the prime minister said: \u201cWhat the British people voted for on 23 June was to bring some control into the movement of people from the European Union to the UK. A points-based system does not give you that control.\u201d</p> <p>In an attempt to illustrate her point, May said Heathrow staff had told her and David Cameron that immigrants were abusing student visa rules through a points-based system.</p> <p>\u201cBut because they met the criteria, they were automatically let in,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with a points-based system. I want a system where the government is able to decide who comes into the country. I think that\u2019s what the British people want.\u201d</p> <p>After the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage suggested that the prime minister was betraying leave voters, No 10 issued a statement on Monday saying the government would devise an immigration system that gave it more control than a points-based system.</p> <p> \u201cOne of the opportunities of Brexit is that we will be able to control the number of people coming to Britain from the EU. The precise way in which the government will control the movement of EU nationals to Britain after Brexit is yet to be determined. However, as the PM has said many times in the past, a points-based system will not work and is not an option,\u201d a No 10 spokeswoman said.</p> <p> \u201cWhen Labour introduced a points-based immigration system, the numbers went straight up. In Australia, they have a points-based system and they have higher immigration per capita than Britain. A points-based system would give foreign nationals the right to come to Britain if they meet certain criteria. An immigration system that works for Britain would ensure that the right to decide who comes to the country resides with the government.\u201d</p> <p> A points-based system applying to migrants from across the world was first suggested by Ukip and quickly championed by the leave campaign, spearheaded by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It would have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/12/uk-immigration-system-not-points-based-minister\">allowed equal access to the UK</a> based on certain criteria, such as skills and qualifications, without giving any special access to those from the EU.</p> <p> Farage said: \u201cTheresa May\u2019s track record on immigration as home secretary was appalling and her comments rejecting an Australian-style points system really worry me.</p> <p> \u201cThere is already huge anxiety out there in the country regarding Theresa May\u2019s reluctance to trigger article 50. Her rejection of the type of migration system so many went out there and voted leave to see implemented indicates serious backsliding.\u201d</p> <p> Remain campaigners also seized on May\u2019s comments as a sign that people who voted for Brexit had been misled.</p> <p> Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP and chair of campaign group Vote Leave Watch, said: \u201cBoris Johnson and his Vote Leave colleagues spent the whole referendum campaign making impossible promises they knew they couldn\u2019t keep. It\u2019s now clear that very few of their pledges were worth the paper they were written on.</p> <p> \u201cTheresa May cannot be let off the hook either. After barely campaigning for remain, our unelected prime minister now contemptuously dismisses policies such as increasing spending on the NHS which people voted on in good faith and great numbers.\u201d</p> <p> No 10 sources said May was still <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/restricting-immigration-will-be-at-heart-of-brexit-deal-theresa-may-says\">intending to honour the essence</a> of what people voted for by bringing in a system that would be <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/09/no-guarantee-points-based-system-reduce-net-migration-experts-warn\">more effective at curbing immigration</a> than the Vote Leave and Ukip idea. Theoretically, this could include a work permit or visa system, restrictions on entry to those with job offers, a quota system or an emergency brake.</p> <p> However, the prime minister has given no details about how this might be done and has not answered the crucial question of whether the government could give preferential access to EU citizens over those from the rest of the world.</p> <p> The dilemma for May is that a number of EU states have indicated that the UK will not get preferential terms for trading without accepting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/after-article-50-the-eu-trade-and-movement-deals-the-uk-could-seek\">at least a degree of free movement</a> for EU citizens.</p> <p> Carlo Calenda, the Italian economic development minister, told Bloomberg: \u201cWe cannot waste two years by negotiating with the UK how to maintain them inside without them wanting to be inside. We cannot afford this paradox \u2026 The more they are going to regulate and limit the presence of EU citizens in the UK, the more we are going to limit the presence of UK goods into Europe.\u201d</p> <p>May also stressed that she had not yet set a date for the triggering of article 50, despite calls from prominent Brexit campaigners for an immediate start to talks with the EU about leaving. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve said on triggering article 50 is that I won\u2019t be triggering it before the end of the year. I haven\u2019t set a date for when it is going to be triggered,\u201d she told the press conference.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

  "<p>The decision by leading leave campaigners such as Boris Johnson to endorse Nigel Farage\u2019s policy of an Australian points-based system for a post-Brexit British approach to immigration was one of the bigger surprises of the referendum campaign.</p> <p>For, as experts such as the Migration Observatory <a href=\"http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/commentaries/uk-immigration-policy-look-like-brexit/\">have pointed out</a>, points-based systems have been used by countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand with liberal migration policies looking to admit more people than come under company-sponsored work permits alone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live\">Theresa May promises only 'some control' over EU migration post-Brexit - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On one calculation, introducing a scaled-up Australian system in Britain could actually double annual immigration to the UK to 1.5 million or more.</p> <p>So it is no wonder that on Monday at her G20 press conference in Hangzhou, the prime minister decisively rejected a points-based immigration system. </p> <p>She argued that the \u201ctick-box\u201d approach of allowing in everyone who meets the criteria was a recipe for abuse, citing the example of \u201cbogus overseas students\u201d. She said that a new immigration policy would involve Britain \u201cregaining an element of control\u201d over EU migrants coming into the country.</p> <p>So what\u2019s wrong with a points-based system? The Australians introduced theirs in 1979 with the aim of attracting skilled migrants from anywhere on the planet. It has certainly helped grow their population to the point where those born overseas now account for 28% of the population \u2013 double the British share.</p> <p>The idea of points-based system \u2013 under which migrants who score highest on qualifications, experience, youth, education and language fluency are offered permanent citizenship \u2013 sounds fair but even the Australians have moved away from that model. </p> <p>For it is a system that means the state, rather than employers, must decide whether childcare centre managers, electrical engineers or even ballerinas are in short supply and should be opened to migrants. Companies sometimes don\u2019t share the state\u2019s assessment of an individual\u2019s overseas experience or qualifications, and in 2013 more than 13% of those who arrived under the points system were unemployed.</p> <p>In fact, the Australians have now introduced an employer-led system of temporary and permanent work visas that have left the points-based system covering only 15% of all migrants entering Australia.</p> <p>As Alp Mehmet of the anti-migration group Migration Watch UK has <a href=\"http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/press-release/398\">put it</a>: \u201cA points-based system might suit the Australians who are trying to increase their population but, in fact, it is extremely complex and would be a non-starter for the UK. Yet another rehash of such a system would be a disaster.\u201d</p> <p>But Britain has a points-based system for non-EU migration so why not for EU migration? As the prime minister knows only too well, the points-based system for skilled non-EU jobs in Britain introduced in 2008 is already full of holes and exceptions. </p> <p>Its cap of 20,700 on tier-two skilled migrants has only recently been reached as exceptions have been repeatedly made in the face of business pressure, notably intra-company transfers and lately to recruit NHS nurses. This was also criticised by the Conservatives as a mechanical \u201ctick-box\u201d immigration system that fails to recognise the complexities of migration.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>So if not a points-based system to reduce Britain\u2019s near record level of 327,00 net migration a year, then what? The main options being canvassed are:</p> <p><strong>Work permits: </strong>As advocated by Lord Green, the chairman of MigrationWatch UK, who proved highly influential in shaping May\u2019s immigration policies as home secretary. He has suggested a Brexit negotiating position that opens with an offer of free movement for European Union tourists, students, pensioners and other self-sufficient people on the basis that it is reciprocated.</p> <p>But that would be accompanied by a proposal that all entry to the UK to work for both EU and non-EU citizens should be subject to the present points-based system of work permits with the cap expanded as necessary. Cap to be decided not by business but by national need. Green claims this could cut net migration by 100,000. A further deep cut would be achieved by a much tougher regime against non-EU students who fail to leave at the end of their studies. Imposing work permits on EU citizens would, however, breach EU free movement rules and so likely lead to highly restricted access to Europe\u2019s single market for goods and services.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue is confidence in the government\u2019s intention to reduce immigration from the EU. This is what the public voted on, not on a particular system. In fact, the prime minister was right to indicate that the Australian points-based system is not appropriate for the UK. The way forward is to expand and adapt our present work permit system. In reality, this will be simpler and more effective,\u201d said Green on Monday.</p> <p><strong>Restricting free movement from the EU:</strong> May herself spelled out a year ago how she thought that Britain could close the door to unskilled labour from within the European Union without losing the UK\u2019s access to the single market.</p> <p>\u201cReducing net EU migration need not mean undermining the principle of free movement,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/article1600014.ece\">she said in a Sunday Times article.</a> \u201cWhen it was first enshrined, free movement meant the freedom to move to a job, not the freedom to cross borders to look for work or claim benefits. Yet last year, four out of 10 EU migrants \u2013 63,000 people \u2013 came here with no definite job offer whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>The latest figures show that the proportion of EU migrants to come to work in Britain in a specific job has risen to more than 70%, with 176,000 having a definite job offer in their pocket. The other 127,000 who came in the last 12 months were looking for work in Britain and most of them found one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2111c7a0745107a44064b2b68a5b7b7f49ee3463\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2111c7a0745107a44064b2b68a5b7b7f49ee3463/0_199_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passport control at Gatwick airport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An outright ban on the 127,000 who came looking for work is highly likely to breach the EU treaties on free movement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An outright ban on the 127,000 who came looking for work is highly likely to breach EU treaties on free movement. But a system in which labour migrants who arrive without a job have to register on a Home Office database, perhaps be issued with an identity card and be obliged to go home if unable to find a job within a few months, might fall within the kind of reform of the EU\u2019s free-movement rules that Britain could put on the table in the Brexit negotiations.</p> <p><strong>Emergency brake: </strong>This option has been backed by both ends of the political spectrum. The Institute of Public Policy Research has argued for Britain to negotiate to be able trigger a temporary halt in EU migration in particular occupations, sectors or locations where wages are being undercut. The Adam Smith Institute has argued for the UK to join the European Economic Area whose members have the power to exercise an emergency brake on any of the four \u201cfreedoms\u201d including freedom of movement.</p> <p>The IPPR\u2019s emergency brake will require constant sectoral and local analysis of labour market wage levels. It also raises questions about who takes the decision to operate the brake and for how long. A decision by Britain alone is likely to produce retaliatory action with countries across the EU closing their doors to British workers. David Cameron raised the question in his pre-Brexit vote tour of the EU and came back with a limited offer of an emergency brake on benefits \u2013 no payments for the first four years. But even that faced threats of legal challenges from other EU states.</p>",

Not to mention the ethical considerations. In any case, there is currently no effective way to treat the latent form of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB).

Where I\u2019m from \u2013 Belfast in Northern Ireland \u2013 peace is intrinsically linked to the cooperation of nationalists and unionists, Protestants and Catholics. It is tied to the idea of a peace process, whereby the Good Friday agreement, a treaty tied to the European convention on human rights, has defined how two opposite sects can live alongside each other in harmony. </p> <p>But this peace is neither universal nor solid, as dissident groups and individuals seek to undermine it daily. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/19/brexit-northern-irish-politics-border-eu-good-friday-agreement\">potentially catastrophic implications for the peace in Northern Ireland</a>, first for the validity of the peace process itself, and second if there is further separation from the Republic by a physical border. As such, the region\u2019s peace is at risk, as well as its development. </p> <p>If sustainable development is to progress in poverty-stricken countries around the world, peacemaking must play its part. Money diverted to arms, and aid funding used to to repair the damage caused by conflict, takes away from investment in hospitals, schools and young people\u2019s futures. However, it is the attitude that comes with war that is most significant, the placing of personal ambitions and strategies for power over the progression of the lives of your people. In Northern Ireland, rejecting this doctrine has so far enabled the fragile peace to endure. </p> <p>Until this power-hungry perspective changes, NGOs must focus on how to control the cause of the conflict.<br></p> <ul> <li><strong>Lucy Keown, University of Glasgow, UK</strong></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"020d3ae1f019939de72b4df051c7ff7508df4134\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/020d3ae1f019939de72b4df051c7ff7508df4134/0_438_5303_3183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A family walks past a mural depicting a scene from Bloody Sunday in Londonderry, Northern Ireland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A family in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, walks past a mural depicting the events of Bloody Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Working collaboratively in conflict zones is vital</h2> <p>Development occurs in conflict.

It is clear that Trump loves only ratings, not credibility. His campaign is a farce and he has been deceiving his followers since the beginning. But the biggest issue is that he handles information like a virus, which has sickened the American people.</p> <p>Trump has said that Mexican and Latin American migrants are the ones who bring guns, crime and drugs into the US, that we Mexicans are responsible for violence. But while he points with one hand to Mexico, with his other hand he encourages the American people to arm themselves \u2013 according to US government figures, seven out of 10 seized weapons in Mexico come from the United States.</p> <p>Trump proves with such statements that he doesn\u2019t care about facts, he doesn\u2019t care about reality. Instead he keeps spreading his distorted point of view, suggesting that he\u2019s completely ignorant or he\u2019s lying.</p> <p>Last Wednesday, in front of the cameras he didn\u2019t have any choice but to recognise Mexico as a commercial partner, and the hard work Mexicans do in the US.

And yet he has stooped even lower, using the needs of his followers to validate himself with a speech full of intolerance, racism and fear. There is no way a nation could grow and prosper with no hope, values or responsibilities.

  "<p>Most years, soups \u2013 like pies, stews and crumbles \u2013 are banished for the summer before I cook them in an excited flurry about the same time as I stop wearing sandals.</p> <p>In winter, I find comfort in deep bowls of vegetables that don\u2019t require chewing. But summer soups are different. I want freshness, crunch, and zippy flavours. So many summer soups are cold, and while I do like a cold soup, I have to say I only crave it when the weather is blistering. I almost always want something warm at dinner time.</p> <p>These late summer soups focus on lightness and brightness. Some days it\u2019s a summery dal of red lentils, spiked with a heap of turmeric and finished with a brave amount of lemon juice. Other days it\u2019s a quick tomato soup, cooked with garlic, no onion, the vines kept on until it\u2019s blended and then finished with a lot of good olive oil.</p> <p>When I do crave a cold soup, I pile the blender with a couple of scooped\u2011out avocados, a head of fennel, a couple of spring onions, the juice of a lemon and some summer herbs, blended with a good handful of ice and drizzled again with good oil when it\u2019s served.</p> <p>There are, of course, gazpacho soups too, my favourite being a white one that\u2019s made with almonds, grapes and bread soaked in vinegar.</p> <p>This week though, it was a warm coconut soup with one of the freshest, cleanest flavour pairings I know: lemongrass and lime leaves. The next one has been made from the hero of the hour: papery husked corn on the cob (not least because its currently my little boy\u2019s favourite vegetable) teamed up with green chilli, courgettes and crisp lettuce.

Let me reassure them: for all the migrants I talked to, Brexit indeed does mean Brexit. We need to clarify what it actually means, but there is no way back, and we all respect that decision.</p> <p>But it also means that all rights of those who chose Britain as their home must be kept, just as they were legally acquired, and their personal dignity must be respected. Future freedom of movement may or may not be up for negotiation, but those who have already invested their future here are not going anywhere. The reported decision of the Harlow victim\u2019s family to bury the Polish man over here, and not back in Poland because they see Britain as their home now, makes this point powerfully.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/04/assault-on-polish-men-harlow-possible-hate-crime\">Latest assault on Polish men in Harlow investigated as possible hate crime</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hate incidents once in motion are difficult to stop, and may escalate quickly and seriously.

Even if the men were not picked on by the gang solely because of their nationality, can we forcefully rule out that their \u201cforeignness\u201d has not in any way contributed to the brutality of the assault?

  "<p>The man elected to rebuild Concacaf after decades of misconduct by officials believes it may take years to change a culture of corruption across the region.</p> <p>The new Concacaf president Victor Montagliani, who leads soccer across North and Central America and the Caribbean, told the Guardian how rebuilding a shattered confederation that is the center of investigations by both Fifa and the US Department of Justice was similar to recovering from a death. </p> <p>He added that players and fans, rather than top level executives, had saved the sport after events last year saw world football\u2019s leadership \u2013 including Fifa president <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36245660\">Sepp Blatter, his Uefa counterpart Michel Platini</a>, and a cast of other regional bosses and business figures \u2013 revealed as crooked, corrupt or, at best, conflicted. </p> <p>\u201cIt is like anything in your life that has had a negative affect or is a tragedy,\u201d said Montagliani who has also served as president of Canada Soccer since 2012.</p> <p>\u201cMoving on doesn\u2019t happen overnight. It is daily, day-out and day-in. Eventually, you do come out of it but what we need to remember is that we don\u2019t forget our history. We want to make sure that, from a confederation standpoint, history never repeats itself.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/01/copa-america-begins-after-scandal-jeffrey-webb-power-broker-illegal-trial-us\">'We have to get back to football': Copa Am\u00e9rica begins amid ashes of scandal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Montagliani was elected president last May to become the confederation\u2019s third president in a year. His predecessors include Jeffrey Webb, a banker from the Cayman Islands, and Alfredo Hawit, a lawyer from Honduras. In the past 12 months, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/11/fifa-alfredo-hawit-admits-corruption\">both pled guilty to corruption-related charges</a> laid by the DOJ while the infamous Jack Warner of Trinidad, Concacaf president from 1990 to 2011, faces <a href=\"http://www.newsday.co.tt/news/0,230099.html\">an extradition request</a> from US authorities in addition to a $50m lawsuit from Concacaf alleging fraudulent misuse of funds. </p> <p>\u201cI am not going to sit calmly in the chair and announce that we are all done,\u201d Montagliani said. \u201cWe are out [of trouble] in some areas but from an overall cultural perspective it is going to take time. Whether you look from the outside in or the inside out, we know that it is a massive challenge There is no doubt.\u201d</p> <p>Montagliani is something of a poster boy for reform within the sport. While other federations supported a Fifa status quo even amid the worldwide scandal that unraveled in 2015, Montagliani led Canada Soccer to announce it would vote against Blatter in his bid for reelection that year. Montagliani and Canada instead publicly announced support for Prince Ali Bin Hussein of Jordan, whose challenge for Fifa\u2019s leadership ultimately failed (<a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/news/usa-back-prince-ali-canada-endorse-infantino-045402063--sow.html\">Canada Soccer switched their allegiance </a>to Gianni Infantino in 2016).</p> <p>The 50-year-old has built a career as a risk manager with Vancouver insurance firms and recently headed the organizing committee for the 2015 Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup, hosted by Canada. He also sits on Fifa\u2019s Reform Committee, Legal Committee, and the Israel-Palestine Relations Committee (yes, Fifa has one). </p> <p>\u201cI totally get the skepticism from the public about reform and I think everyone at Fifa gets it,\u201d Montagliani said. \u201cWe are starting to see a bit of humbleness from the sport\u2019s leaders and that is a good thing. The one thing that people have to realize is that as much as there has been a bit of a shitstorm here in the past few years, the game itself is in good shape. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s for two reasons: the players and the fans. The fans want to go and see Messi and Neymar and their clubs and those two elements have saved the game. At the end of the day it is not guys like me who are going to save the game. What I have got to make sure of is that we serve the players and fans to the maximum so this kind of shit doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d </p> <p>Concacaf, whose 41-members include regional giants Mexico and the United States as well as small Caribbean islands like St Lucia and Montserrat, was effectively eviscerated by last year\u2019s corruption scandal. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article22409883.html\">Its Miami headquarters were raided by the FBI</a> and 16 individuals with ties to the organization as federation representatives or as commercial partners were indicted. In addition, Traffic Sports International and Traffic Sports USA \u2013 related companies boasting media and events partnerships with Concacaf \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.us/concacaf-gold-cup/story/2515574/concacaf-ends-partnership-with-traffic-sports-fraud-charges\">pled guilty to wire fraud conspiracy</a>. </p> <p>Montagliani has unique perspective on Concacaf\u2019s commercial partnerships. He sat on the evaluation committee that initially appointed Traffic as a media and marketing rights holder in 2012 and then later headed a review committee that severed Concacaf\u2019s Traffic deal in 2015 after the revelations. </p> <p>\u201cWe have started the conversation with both Fifa and the Department of Justice [about cleaning up Concacaf],\u201d Montagliani said. \u201cMore so with Fifa than the DOJ. The DOJ are the silent types, let me put it that way. They don\u2019t necessarily say anything if you are doing well but if you are not doing well you will hear about it. Hopefully, there are no other crabs on the rocks for us. If there are we will deal with it and [the DOJ] will deal with it but we are going to do the right thing. </p> <p>\u201cThe clean up is not so much just governance. That should be obvious to everybody. It is also a corporate clean up: how we do things; how we communicate; a lot of little things. I did a tour with our new general secretary last month to visit all our current sponsors and partners. More than one of them said to me that I was the first president to have ever gone to visit them. These are some of our sponsors that have been with us since the 1990s. A little thing like that makes a cultural change in the organization.\u201d </p> <p>Big money sponsors aside, Montagliani stressed it was important for the sport\u2019s administrators to reflect on the depth of their responsibilities. \u201cWhat motivates me more than anything is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you are wearing a suit and are a sports executive or any of that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI still feel sometimes like a little 12-year-old boy, sitting in front of the TV screaming at his favorite team. I have to remind people of that because this job is not always like the corporate world where you are doing things because of a bottom line and there are shareholders. </p> <p>\u201cSometimes, the bottom line is is not necessarily that you made \u2018x\u2019 amount of dollars on the Gold Cup. Sometimes, it is making sure 14-year-old girls from Haiti get an opportunity to play in a tournament.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Theresa May has cast doubt on whether Brexit will lead either to a points-based immigration system or an extra \u00a3100m a week for the NHS \u2013 two central promises made by the successful campaign to leave the European Union.</p> <p>The prime minister declined to endorse pledges made by the official Vote Leave group as she headed to China for the G20 summit, where Japan and the US have issued strong warnings about the consequences of exiting the EU.</p> <p>In an unprecedented set of demands over the terms of Britain\u2019s exit, Tokyo said Japanese firms could move to other parts of Europe unless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/japan-brexit-demands-range-from-possible-to-fanciful\">many of the current privileges</a> of membership were maintained. <br></p> <p> Speaking from her prime ministerial plane, May questioned whether the type of system that admits migrants based on their skills was effective, and did not rule out retaining preferential access arrangements for EU citizens. \u201cOne of the issues is whether or not points-based systems do work,\u201d she said, stressing that there was \u201cno single silver bullet\u201d on reducing immigration.</p> <p> May also refused to commit to working towards the promises made by Vote Leave of an extra \u00a3100m a week to the NHS, scrapping VAT on fuel bills or ending contributions to the EU budget.</p> <p>She would only say: \u201cI\u2019m going to work for what I just said I\u2019m going to work for: the best possible deal for the UK in terms of the relationship that we would have with the EU, following us leaving.\u201d</p> <p>Her decision not to endorse the key planks of the Vote Leave manifesto may anger some of the electorate who thought they were voting for firm pledges made by politicians now senior in May\u2019s government, such as Boris Johnson.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91d377ea4626b2a7d9a139756bd6fb4420a70451\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91d377ea4626b2a7d9a139756bd6fb4420a70451/0_157_4324_2595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson and Liam Fox\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson, left, and Liam Fox at a Vote Leave event in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> On becoming prime minister, May satisfied many Tory leave campaigners with a pledge that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, but she has not set out what this means, beyond a pledge to move away from the current system of free movement of EU citizens.</p> <p>The prime minister has repeatedly said she intends to make a success of leaving the EU but admitted this weekend that there were difficult times ahead for the economy, even though it is currently doing better than many predicted before the 23 June referendum.</p> <p>She backed the position of the former chancellor George Osborne that there were no plans for more welfare cuts, but left the door open for this to shift if the economy deteriorated. \u201cWe are continuing the plans we have as a government,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously we have to look and see what happens in the economy, and how the economy does start to move ...

  "<p>As the presidential election enters the home stretch, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is in a vulnerable position. In recent weeks, the Republican nominee has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump\">changed key aides</a> yet again, flip-flopped on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/donald-tump-immigration-mixed-messages-republicans\">his signature issue of immigration</a> and stayed well behind Hillary Clinton in fundraising, organization and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/donald-trump-nascar-north-carolina-republicans\">polling</a>.</p> <p>Trump is by no means out of the race, but his path to victory relies as much on Clinton missteps as on his own successes. That means he now has a clear goal. He is not going to try to be a normal candidate. There will be no attempt to pivot to the center. There will not be a softer side. </p> <p>Trump will be the same fiery demagogue that tore up the Republican primary. The goal will not be to dam his torrent of political incorrectness. It will be to channel it, to produce maximum appeal to voters.</p> <p>The biggest change in the Trump campaign in recent weeks was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">the replacement</a> of top aide Paul Manafort with a two-headed team, pollster Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager and rightwing publisher Steve Bannon as campaign CEO. The two took over in mid-August, after a series of revelations about Manafort\u2019s ties to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/donald-trump-campaign-paul-manafort-ukraine-yanukovich\">allies of Russian president Vladimir Putin</a>. </p> <p>A veteran of Republican campaigns since 1976, Manafort was brought on to help guide the campaign through the arcane process of delegate selection for the Republican convention in Cleveland. He was then able to push out Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s previous campaign manager, who was known for his brash, hard-charging style. </p> <p>Manafort is known for his charisma, but he was not able to bring it to bear on Trump. Before the billionaire clinched the nomination, Manafort <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/21/trump-campaign-republican-establishment-election-strategy\">promised top Republicans</a> his candidate was putting on \u201can act\u201d for primary voters. Trump was reportedly furious, and therefore did his utmost to demonstrate that he was just being himself.</p> <p>Trump subsequently meandered from controversy to controversy, a situation not helped by the fact that unlike Lewandowski, Manafort did not travel with him. It is almost unheard for campaign managers to travel with their candidate, but no candidate in American history has been so impulsive as Trump. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/03/citizens-united-david-bossie-trump-campaign\">Trump's new hire David Bossie has decades-long history attacking Clintons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The result?

As a result, the campaign\u2019s brains trust, which also includes Trump\u2019s son-in-law <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/jared-kushner-new-york-observer-jewish-antisemitism\">Jared Kushner</a>, has no experience working for a presidential candidate in a general election. It is however well-attuned to Trump\u2019s idiosyncratic ways.</p> <p>One of the biggest changes is that Trump now uses a teleprompter when speaking, even at his raucous campaign rallies. Although he has long disdained the device and boasted of his ability to improvise every night, thanks to the arrival of Conway he has finally been persuaded to stick to something resembling a script. </p> <p>No one, of course, should mistake Trump for an automaton. He uses his prepared remarks in the same way John Coltrane used the sheet music to My Favorite Things: as the basis for a series of wild riffs. But the presence of the teleprompter means that Trump at least gets back to the basic notes, rather than off on a politically costly solo.</p> <p>The most glaring sign Trump\u2019s new reliance on technology came at the end of August, at an Iowa fundraiser for Senator Joni Ernst that was held in a barn on the state fairgrounds, where livestock normally compete for blue ribbons. Politician after politician took the stage to cheers from crowd sitting on benches on the dirt floor, wolfing down barbecued pork sandwiches.

Instead, it was about public safety and the \u201cwellbeing of the American people\u201d.</p> <p>In the aftermath of a speech that showed little potential to improve poll numbers among Latino voters, a number of members of Trump\u2019s Hispanic advisory council resigned. A recent poll showed <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-1472827916-htmlstory.html\">only 19% of Hispanics</a> supporting Trump. In 2004, George W Bush won 44%. In one recent poll, Trump\u2019s approval rating among African Americans was <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/341993/trump-public-policy-polling-0-percent/\">zero</a>. To win, he will have to run the table with white voters.</p> <p>Trump does appeal to disconnected blue-collar white voters. While diverse states like Colorado and Virginia, swing states in past cycles, have moved off the map, Trump is showing staying power in places such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/donald-trump-iowa-republican-red-state\">Iowa</a> and Nevada, which have recently leaned Democratic. The problem is that those states have comparatively few votes in the electoral college.

Colorado and Virginia look well out of his reach.</p> <p>The bigger question is whether to take the battle into enemy territory. Trump has proved so unpopular among some Republican voters, minorities and women, that deep red territory is perhaps in play.

Even Utah, where Trump has riled conservative Mormons, has seen the Clinton campaign <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/08/23/clinton-field-office-utah-sullivan/89200340/\">open a field office</a>. </p> <p>Whether these moves amount to a radical new strategy or clever feints to trick Trump is not clear.

  "<p>Amat Escalante is the director who made a considerable splash at Cannes in 2013 with Heli, a brutal slice of working-class life in narcoterrorist Mexico, which won him the best director award. Now Escalante is back with a follow-up, The Untamed \u2013 though its original title is La Regi\u00f3n Salvaje (The Savage Region), which seems to fit its mysterious, elliptical narrative a little better.</p> <p>Escalante\u2019s film begins by pitching us into a knotty, but not immediately unlikely, drama of family dysfunction in a small Mexican town. Ale is unhappy with her boringly macho husband Angel; he\u2019s got a decent job, with a surveying crew, but is secretly cheating on Ale with \u2013 of all people \u2013 her doctor brother Fabian. (Angel\u2019s method of deflecting suspicion is to pour a stream of homophobic abuse in to Ale\u2019s ear; in true machista style it\u2019s not entirely clear that he\u2019s not entirely in earnest.) Ale is also cursed with an overbearing mother-in-law, to whom Ale is indebted for a job and from whom she must accept a proprietal interest in her two small children.</p> <p>Incrementally, Escalante\u2019s narrative begins to get surreal round the edges, largely through the agency of Veronica, a young woman who seems to have no ties but an ability to befriend people. Fabian treats her for a dog bite, and soon she persuades him to take a trip to an isolated tract of country: soon after Fabian is found naked and unconscious in a culvert, the victim of a sexual assault so severe it has rendered him comatose. Angel\u2019s illicit relationship with him is uncovered, to Ale\u2019s dismay, and he is quickly arrested.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/may/19/heli-director-amat-escalante-video-interview\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/3gvkm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"1909813\"            data-video-name=\"Heli director Amat Escalante: critics are 'cowards' - video interview\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/18/1368891804165/Film-director-Amat-Escala-005.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-409105471\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/18/1368891804165/Film-director-Amat-Escala-005.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/5/18/130518HeliInterview_FromRemote-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/5/18/130518HeliInterview_FromRemote_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/5/18/130518HeliInterview_FromRemote/130518HeliInterview_FromRemote.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/5/18/130518HeliInterview_FromRemote_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/may/19/heli-director-amat-escalante-video-interview\">Heli director Amat Escalante</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s at this point that things get seriously freaky.

(One spectacularly odd shot features a whole selection of farm animals rutting together in a giant pit.) Suffice to say, it messes Ale and Angel\u2019s family dynamics up even more, to the point of irretrievability. </p> <p>Throughout all this, Escalante retains his washed-out, low-key shooting style: occasionally the frame appears so muddy it\u2019s hard to make out exactly what is going on. Escalante also appears to have appropriated some of the style tics of fellow Mexican director Carlos Reygadas, though in truth The Untamed falls some way short of Reygadas\u2019 rich stew of imagery. What Escalante has contrived is, however, eye-popping enough; but in all honesty The Untamed doesn\u2019t seem to go anywhere special. But connoisseurs of oddness may cherish it.</p>",

After living and working in France, Germany and the Netherlands, in 2000 I sold up and emigrated to live in the tropics \u2013 where, believe it or not, I get bored.</p> <p>These days I fly back to the UK in April, pick up the keys to a truck, hitch up a trailer and take off on a four-month European tour for a company that specialises in transporting equipment for bands. As a public school wide-boy, of whom there are many in the music business, with a taste for the open road, I\u2019ve found my niche \u2013 where, as long as you do the job right, a certain degree of eccentricity isn\u2019t a disadvantage.</p> <p>I love waking up and pulling back the cab curtains, not knowing what the view will be and getting paid good money to go to places other people pay good money to go to. Norway is my favourite; I couldn\u2019t afford to go there otherwise. Working in the music business also means I don\u2019t have to tolerate the awful working conditions some UK drivers accept: horrible food, lack of parking, filthy toilets and showers, hanging around unpaid while waiting to load and unload. No wonder there\u2019s such a shortage of drivers.</p> <p>I have only met my boss once, very briefly. In the music business you\u2019re left to get on with it and plan your own routes. I enjoy getting on with the crew and the musicians I work for. As humble diesel demons, we\u2019re not really supposed to hang out with the talent, but I ignore that.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A few years ago I was driving the equipment around Europe for a heavy metal band from New Orleans</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The EU may have made border transit delays a thing of the past, but English hauliers have had almost all their European work taken from them by eastern European hauliers, operating under EU rules, who have cut prices to an absurdly low level and driven firms from wealthier countries out of business. The trucks you see lined up in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/06/operation-stack-new-lorry-park-stanford-west-kent-m20-congestion\">Operation Stack</a> on the motorway in Kent are almost all from eastern Europe, not the UK. The EU, as it applies to truck-driving, has meant flooding the market with cheap foreign labour, which is perceived to have forced down wages and worsened working conditions. It\u2019s not just a British problem. I noticed recently that even Spanish hauliers are now using Romanian-registered subcontractors.</p> <p>One of my colleagues had a brick through his windscreen last week in Calais. It feels like only a matter of time before real trouble kicks off there. Around the \u201cJungle\u201d is obviously a flashpoint but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/31/dismantle-calais-camp-modern-slave-trade-traffickers\">people traffickers</a> have now penetrated far further inland into France, with each gang \u201cowning\u201d a services centre, systematically assaulting English-bound vehicles, so nowhere within 300 miles of the Channel is safe. The French police don\u2019t seem to care.</p> <p>Quite a few of my fellow drivers are linguists; many live abroad too. Speaking a foreign language helps, and can open other doors. A few years ago I was driving the equipment around Europe for a heavy metal band from New Orleans. During the end-of-tour party in Bilbao, the tour manager found out I lived in Brazil, so she invited me to tour South America and Mexico with the band as a guitar tech and translator.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say the job is all fun and games: it\u2019s bloody hard work too. Last month I travelled 17,000 kilometres, including a drive from the Arctic circle in northern Finland all the way to Lisbon, 24-hours off, then non-stop to Milan, Valencia, then back to London. Needless to say, it isn\u2019t a line of work that allows much time for a work/life balance.</p> <p>Sometimes I wish I\u2019d got into the music business earlier, but had I not already paid my dues on general haulage I wouldn\u2019t have been good enough. Just as every good production and tour manager I\u2019ve met started pushing boxes at midnight for peanuts, every good tour driver learned their trade trying to do five collections in Milan on a Friday afternoon, or 25 deliveries inside the M25. Actual over-the-road driving skills are assumed: a tour driver\u2019s real added value is experience, knowing whether a route is possible within the set time limit. That and people skills, being diplomatic enough to get any potential problem sorted in advance, without ruffling feathers.</p> <p>A tour driver needs to be able to apply the planned tour schedule, set months in advance, to the EU truck and bus driving rules, which are, and this is a very short approximate summary of the basics: 90 hours\u2019 driving time over two weeks; nine hours\u2019 driving per day, 10 hours a day twice a week. Breaks: at least 11 hours per night, shortened twice a week to nine hours. Obligatory 24- and 45-hour breaks over a two-week period.</p> <p>All trucks, thankfully, are equipped these days with digicards: credit card-sized chip gizmos which record our every movement and are impossible to falsify, so all transport businesses now run legally. Everyone operates on the same playing field, not only in the niche market of the music business but also in other types of transport. Efficient businesses make money.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/secret-life-female-dj-music-industry-misogyny\">The secret life of a DJ: a joyous job in a grimly misogynistic industry | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m insured. The trucks are taxed. Bribery and other shenanigans are almost unheard-of. We drive top-of-the-range trucks with fridges and night heaters and get paid on time. In the old days, at least when I started, the opposite was true.</p> <p>All in all I love my job. However, never having had one, a work contract would be nice. And it\u2019s definitely a lifestyle choice, not a sensible career option. My take-home pay is only relatively high because catering is paid for by the artist\u2019s production company, and I\u2019m paid while away from base during my time off. Averaged out per year, there\u2019s more money driving nights for a supermarket. But I\u2019m not complaining.</p> <p>The greatest pleasure is listening to good music. Hearing Tom Jones warm up backstage, for example \u2013 what a voice. I love the solitude of driving and the sense of reward of being good at what I do, trusted to go out alone on a four-month tour around Europe for famous artists, knowing that everyone relies on me to get to every show on time.

The city administration is theoretically answerable to the national assembly of people\u2019s power, but they don\u2019t have budgetary control \u2013 that is in the hands of central government. A channel of complaint from the population can only lead to an advisory department, rather than the funding source, according to Stephen Wilkinson at the International Institute for the Study of Cuba.</p> <p>But above all, Cuba has limited resources. It\u2019s a trade-dependent country living with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/22/obama-cuba-embargo-free-market-economy\">56-year US embargo</a>. <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/whosWho/academic_staff/Profiles/HYaffe.aspx\">Helen Yaffe</a>, an LSE fellow who specialises in the Cuban economy and has spent years living in Havana, says: \u201cYou have to start with the blockade [which has prevented trade and investment from the US since 1960], although you don\u2019t want to always sound defensive. But the authorities here have very limited budget. They have to prioritise what they do with their hard currency.\u201d<br></p> <p>As Yaffe points out, Cuba is a country of contradictions. You might have to swerve a hole in the pavement on a daily basis, but the government does provide free universal healthcare and education (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/mar/21/barack-obama-cuba-visit-raul-castro?page=with:block-56f04384e4b04098f62c5d71#block-56f04384e4b04098f62c5d71\">Raul Castro used these services as a defence</a> when questioned about the government\u2019s record of human rights violations during Obama\u2019s visit).

This is somehow also part of the change; that Cubans are becoming individualistic,\u201d he says. He sees this apathy as a \u201cpassive dissidence\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cI remember when I was a kid there was something called <em>Domingo Rojo</em> (\u2018Red Sunday\u2019) and everybody in the neighbourhood decided we were going to clean the streets, like a communal voluntary service, and it was great. But nobody believes in the voluntary thing now, in communism. There is incredible hostility between government and citizens \u2026 every day.\u201d<br></p> <p>Bahia agrees. He has also noticed a feeling of apathy in Cuban society: \u201cIn the long term people react to the the impositions [by the government] of solidarity, the community and so on. Those kinds of things must not be imposed because it creates the opposite effect. For example, with the trash on the street, I told a neighbour about it, and he said to me to take another route to avoid this trash.

  "<p>Donald Trump entered a bitter war of words with Senator Jeff Flake on Sunday as the Republican nominee reverted to his behavior in the primary where he constantly attacked elected GOP officials.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/772571293438840832\">used Twitter</a> to attack Flake, a first-term senator from Arizona who has yet to commit to supporting Trump in November, as \u201cvery weak and ineffective\u201d on the issue of immigration. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"tr\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake.

That\u2019s not clear at all. Some people said it was hardening, some said softening. I say it was just confusing.\u201d </p> <p>The result left Flake feeling that it was unlikely that he would be able to support the Republican nominee in the election. \u201cIt becomes increasingly difficult to see that he\u2019s going to change, so I don\u2019t expect that I\u2019ll be able to support him in November,\u201d said Flake.</p> <p>Trump had spent the two weeks leading up to his major immigration speech on Wednesday hinting at support for a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants before reversing course. This culminated when Trump made a surprise visit to Mexico to meet with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto where he described illegal immigration as a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d. Only few hours later, while speaking to crowd of supporters in Phoenix, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/in-arizona-we-saw-the-real-donald-trump-the-one-we-already-knew\">Trump announced</a> \u201cthere will be no amnesty\u201d and insisted \u201canyone who enters the United States illegally is subject to deportation, otherwise we don\u2019t have a country.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has tangled with Flake before. In July, the Arizona senator <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/07/donald-trump-meeting-congress-republicans-divided-responses\">confronted</a> Trump in a closed door meeting with other Republican elected officials in Washington DC. Flake has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/sen-jeff-flake-gop-should-shift-resources-from-trump-to-sena?utm_term=.vhWzaZP2A#.oc483BgkR\">since called on</a> the RNC to shift resources away from Trump and towards downballot races.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s war of words with Flake comes 64 days before the election and with polls in Flake\u2019s home state of Arizona looking increasing close. Hillary Clinton has recently begun advertising in the once deep red state and recent polls show Arizona to be <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/az/arizona_trump_vs_clinton-5832.html\">a toss-up in November</a> as the state\u2019s growing Hispanic population has been alienated by Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric. </p> <p>In addition, the attack on Flake, who is one of the most prominent Mormon politicians in the United States, risks further alienating that traditionally conservative demographic. Mormons have long viewed the Republican nominee unfavorably and their discontent has contributed to Trump\u2019s weak poll numbers in states like Arizona as well as Utah. </p> <p>Flake is not the only Republican senator who is not voting for the party\u2019s nominee. At least half a dozen others are refusing to back Trump\u2019s candidacy, ranging from arch-conservative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/29/nebraska-republican-senator-ben-sasse-says-he-wont-vote-for-trump\">Ben Sasse</a> of Nebraska to moderate Susan Collins of Maine. </p>",
  "<h2>The Billion Pound Flower Market <br>8pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>The flower industry is worth \u00a3100bn globally and is dominated by the Dutch, who have their mass-production techniques down pat. However, a new crop of Brits are using various initiatives to persuade customers to buy locally, including 21-year-old Jay and florist Geoff, who has learned Dutch to buy flowers at auction in the Netherlands. A touch of the Brexit spirit at work here: plucky, unfancied Brits taking on Big Europe. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2><strong>London 1666 </strong><br><br>8.30pm, BBC4</h2> <p>A bakery mishap sparked a conflagration that destroyed most of London 350 years ago this week. Lauren Laverne hosts this commemoration \u2013 a live broadcast of the ignition of sculptor David Best\u2019s new work, a 100-metre-long replica of London\u2019s 17th-century skyline, afloat on the Thames. The documentary includes interviews with the team who built the fire sculpture, reflecting on how to remember a disaster that, ultimately, allowed London to rebuild, much improved. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2><strong>Cold Feet </strong><br>9pm, ITV</h2> <p>Mike Bullen\u2019s Manchester-set dramedy returns after 13 years. So does the old magic still linger? It\u2019s tricky to tell from this opener, which spends so much time mapping out how its principals\u2019 lives (sans the late Rachel) have changed, as well as getting new story arcs running, that everything seems rushed, even frantic. Which perhaps explains why the best moments involve deadpan Pete (John Thomson) slowing things down: \u201cPete, do you think Jen might be right?\u201d \u201cVery rarely.\u201d <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2><strong>We the Jury </strong><br>10pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Imagine being so excited about jury duty you cartwheel your way to the courtroom? William can \u2013 his call-up falls on his 30th birthday, scratching a lifelong itch for dispensing justice. His co-jurors in James Acaster\u2019s comedy are equally enthusiastic, eagerness arrested only by self-centred idiocy. The crime is murder; sadly, their concentration is focused exclusively on how they\u2019re depicted by the courtroom artist. A delightfully off-kilter highlight of the BBC\u2019s sitcom season. <em>Mark&#xa0;Gibbings-Jones </em></p> <h2><strong>Too Posh to Parent </strong><br>10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>One of those wilfully provocative documentaries that will likely cause many more grounded parents than those featured here to mount their high horses in indignation. As the film discovers, the very rich are now outsourcing potty training, never mind the cooking. With such luxury of choice, are the child-rearing tasks that wealthy parents decide to perform themselves the most rewarding ones? <em>John&#xa0;Robinson</em></p> <h2>Dara \u00d3 Briain\u2019s Go 8 Bit <br>10pm, Dave </h2> <p>New panel-show fun, as gamers, comedians and series creators Steve McNeil and Sam Pamphilon take on a series of videogame challenges. This week\u2019s guests are Susan Calman and David James and, with \u00d3 Briain reliably droll as host and Ellie Gibson excellent in a sort of Richard Osman sidekick role, it\u2019s 70% chat and very funny, too. So it\u2019s not a huge problem that, apart from beat-\u2019em-ups, watching gaming on TV is confusing and dull. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Inside Amy Schumer <br>10.30pm, Comedy Central</h2> <p>Season four kicks off, and the US comic seems unlikely to reach the viral heights of previous series: a sketch in which she undermines Broadway composer Lin-Manuel Miranda with her own musical is surprisingly flat, while another where congressmen interrogate her on her reproductive health ends without a punchline. Although playfully titled The World\u2019s Most Interesting Woman in the World, there\u2019s little here to fascinate, let alone share. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Gerry</strong> <strong>(Gus van Sant, 2002) Monday, 1.45am, Film4</strong></p> <p>Two guys called Gerry (Matt Damon and Casey Affleck) abandon their car in the New Mexico desert and go walking until they are hopelessly lost. They plod through disbelief, desperation and resignation towards a bleak ending, sharing enigmatic little dude-discussions as they go. Made before his Cannes Palme d\u2019Or winner Elephant, and after the mainstream Damon-drama Good Will Hunting, this feels like Gus van Sant\u2019s return to his indie roots, and a beautiful one at that, thanks to Harris Savides\u2019s wilderness photography. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>Shane</strong> <strong>(George Stevens, 1953) 4.35pm, Film4</strong></p> <p>Buckskin-clad Alan Ladd is Shane, a reluctant gunfighter who rides into town to defend against a ruthless rancher and his hired gun: a grinning Jack Palance.

  "<p>Poland wants to play the role of the UK\u2019s intermediary in the Brexit talks, but tariff-free access to the single market will require concessions on the free movement of people, the Polish deputy prime minister has said.

It should be a cold shower on some hot heads in Brussels.\u201d</p> <p>He suggested that a European Economic Area arrangement for the UK was not beyond his imagination and might prove to to be the right platform for a continued British relationship with the EU.</p> <p>\u201cBoth parties are aware that the more fragmentation there is, the less clout there will be in the hands of the EU and the UK.

We assume all countries are equal, and we don\u2019t believe more and more harmonisation is the answer,\u201d Morawiecki said.</p> <p>For all the talk of Anglo-Polish friendship, Morawiecki was in London to join the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/japanese-ambassador-warns-companies-could-leave-uk-over-brexit\">trail of foreign leaders</a> encouraging UK business, including the financial sector, to leave post-Brexit Britain for Europe to gain access to the single market. Across the City, he found concern about the loss of passport rights and said Poland was there to help.</p> <p>He also expects tens of thousands of Poles to return to their homeland in the next decade, as the Polish economy grows. Morawiecki said he is considering ways to actively encourage such returns by making the Polish educational system flexible enough to accommodate Poles who have been through the English school system.</p> <p>\u201cThere are many reasons to return. There are more opportunities to find a decent job, unemployment is at a historically low level, and new businesses are being developed by national companies,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a relative convergence of Polish salaries with the rest of Europe and already we have GDP per capita at 70% vis-\u00e0-vis the EU average, so there will be less incentive to look for a job somewhere else. A period is coming to an end.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Nick Cave is no stranger to bold creative statements.<br></p> <p>This week he will deliver two more gripping and impassioned works. A 3D, black and white film, One More Time With Feeling, out Thursday, which tracks the making of his new album, Skeleton Tree, out Friday. Both works will directly address <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/10/nick-caves-son-died-from-fall-after-taking-lsd-inquest-hears\">the tragic loss of his son last year</a>. </p> <p> While we brace ourselves for a moving double knockout punch, here are some of his finest perfectly twisted musical treats from deep in the shadows of his back catalogue. </p> <h2><strong>The Hammer Song \u2013 </strong><strong>The Good Son</strong><strong> (1990)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9te0KPjXtM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N9te0KPjXtM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/07/nick-cave-bad-seeds-sick-bag-song-interview\">Nick Cave: \u2018The idea of censoring things as you write, it\u2019s something I don\u2019t do\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a primal momentum to Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds\u2019 sound. The cinematic, creepy production of the rhythm in tunes such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrxePKps87k\">Red Right Hand</a> is burned into dark pulse of the musical underground. If it\u2019s that kind of classic Cave footprint you crave, The Hammer is worth a listen. </p> <p>Never one to shy away from the epic, Cave brings forth borderline absurdist levels of grand frontier mythology crossed with the Bible at its most apocalyptic.</p> <p><em>Many miles did I roam<br></em><em>Through the ice and through the snow<br></em><em>My horse died on the seventh day</em></p> <p>The actual hammer described in the song is the most powerful and yet quietest tool I have ever heard described in song. </p> <h2><strong>(I\u2019ll Love You) Till the End of the World \u2013 </strong><strong>Until the End of the World</strong><strong> soundtrack (1991)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzp8I-naJOg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qzp8I-naJOg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> Cave is a renaissance man. His ability for supreme and consistent creative output of all kinds is awe-inspiring. He\u2019s a novelist, screenwriter, director, actor and poet, over and above his various musical identities. </p> <p>In (I\u2019ll Love You) Till the End of the World, he seems to wear all his hats at once. He acts out his hard-boiled, spoken narrative, cigarette in hand, before ushering in the reassuring lilt of the chorus. </p> <p>Despite having artistic integrity in spades, Cave has never been afraid to work to a brief if given the right opportunity. In this song, as with so much of his recent soundtrack work with Warren Ellis, I can see how inspiring and constructive having his creativity constrained and directed can be. It leads to some of his most intriguing and surprising work. </p> <h2><strong>Lay Me Low \u2013 </strong><strong>Let Love In</strong><strong> (1994)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A6gkzSv8so\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9A6gkzSv8so?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Cave\u2019s songs have a gift for making my jaw drop in horror and then, thanks to a deft lyrical twist, making me inadvertently laugh at the unlaughable. He makes me smirk in the face of doom in the most unexpected and beautiful way.<br></p> <p>There is no better evidence of his wicked humour than in Lay Me Low, in which Cave paints a graphic and hilarious picture of the aftermath of his own death. From the grandiose proclamations of the size of the motorcade at his funeral to the intimate and surreal minutiae of his mourners trying to get in touch with his mother on the phone but getting stuck on the line with his brother, who can\u2019t help spill the beans about a long forgotten ex-lover. </p> <p><em>They\u2019ll interview my teachers<br></em><em>Who\u2019ll say I was one of God\u2019s sorrier creatures</em></p> <p>Though it\u2019s no surprise that his teachers might have found young Nick a bit of a troublemaker, I have a feeling that they\u2019d now be more than happy to brag that he haunted the back row of their classroom. </p> <h2><strong>Sleeping Annaleah \u2013 </strong><strong>Kicking Against the Pricks</strong><strong> (1986)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aKFF6paEbE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1aKFF6paEbE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Relatively early in the life of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, the band made an album consisting exclusively of covers.

On the flipside, how much more twisted and dark can one be than screwing with Tom Jones? </p> <p>Cave treads a most beautiful tightrope here, exploding the song and covering it in a potent grime while somehow also honouring the original.</p> <h2><strong>We Call Upon the Author \u2013 </strong><strong>Dig, Lazarus, Dig</strong><strong> (2008)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGivD8aJi4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lyGivD8aJi4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Dig, Lazarus, Dig saw an increasingly sage-like Cave looking outwards, taking names and looking for answers. After the epic barrage that was Grinderman, he returned to some of his older seedy cronies ready to spill the beans on the state of the world. </p> <p>In We Call Upon the Author we catch a glimpse through Cave\u2019s reddening eyes. He pleads through the Bad Seeds\u2019 rollicking and hypnotic cacophony as he asks who is responsible for all the damn mess? Who is the ultimate author who can answer for our farcical state of chaos?

  "<p>Last week, the Fair Work Commission forbade unionists from saying mean things about contractors undercutting sacked workers at the Carlton and United Breweries site in Abbotsford, Melbourne.</p> <p>Specifically, <a href=\"https://www.fwc.gov.au/documents/awardsandorders/html/pr584404.htm\">the commission\u2019s order prohibited certain union officials</a> from \u201ccall[ing] out \u2026 using offensive or insulting names including \u2018scab\u2019, \u2018dog\u2019, \u2018fuckwit\u2019, \u2018cunt\u2019 [or] \u2018rat\u2019\u201d to those now labouring at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/30/dont-let-the-election-distract-you-from-whats-happening-to-workers\">brewery in place of staff locked out some months ago</a>.</p> <p>In recent times, we\u2019ve heard a great deal about the importance of being able to to insult and offend whomsoever we choose, with Cory Bernardi managing to coral <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/30/cory-bernardis-racial-discrimination-revolt-supported-by-up-to-20-senators\">almost every Coalition backbench senator</a> behind his crusade to protect that glorious liberty from the Racial Discrimination Act.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/02/forget-one-nation-cory-bernardi-is-the-politician-to-watch\">Cory Bernardi is more dangerous than One Nation \u2013 his party is in power | Jason Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis sort of taking offence at everything has gone too far within our society,\u201d Eric Abetz told the press, as he signed his name to Bernardi\u2019s motion.</p> <p>You\u2019d think, then, that the senators would be aghast about the nanny state imposing its delicate sensibilities in, of all places, a brewery, especially through a ban far more direct and immediate than any order yet enforced through the RDA.</p> <p>Let\u2019s remember, while Andrew Bolt might have been dragged to court under the legislation, the guilty finding against him didn\u2019t result in jail or a fine. His columns weren\u2019t declared illegal, they weren\u2019t withdrawn and Bolt wasn\u2019t even made to apologise.</p> <p>A few sentences were appended clarifying factually incorrect claims. That was it.</p> <p>Gallileo, he ain\u2019t.</p> <p>Everyone knows that, had a judge decreed that Bolt couldn\u2019t write or say particular words, white conservative tears would have flowed into a deluge of Biblical proportions, a great ocean of salty outrage and self-pity.</p> <p>But that hypocrisy\u2019s typical of the so-called free speech debate in Australia, where there\u2019s almost an inverse proportion between the severity of censorship and the degree of outrage of the so-called libertarians.</p> <p>You could not find, for instance, a more draconian violation of speech rights than that underpinning the offshore detention of asylum seekers. The immigration department flatly refuses to release basic information about its activities; journalists lack access to camps in which staff face two years jail for speaking out about what they see; refugees remain detained for years without charge in isolated facilities with little contact with the outside world.</p> <p>Yet, almost without exception, the senators campaigning for freedom enthusiastically support a refugee policy that couldn\u2019t exist without censorship.</p> <p>There\u2019s an especial irony to the indifference shown by the free speech warriors to the CUB case, since the ban imposed on the word \u201cscab\u201d actually illustrates a genuine problem with the sorts of legislation that our freedom senators hate. </p> <p>The legal system (almost by definition) simultaneously abstracts and individualises behaviour it seeks to criminalise, stripping it from the context from which it derives meaning. As a result, there\u2019s a long history of measures passed by those seeking to deter racism or sexism and then being hijacked by the privileged to use against the oppressed (much as David Leyonhjelm\u2019s seeking to do with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/15/david-leyonhjelm-racial-discrimination-complaint-angry-white-male-fairfax-18c\">stunt prosecution of Fairfax</a>).</p> <p>We can see something similar taking place in Abbottsford, where the commission\u2019s ruling derives from amendments introduced into the Fair Work Act by the Gillard government in 2013 to combat workplace bullying.</p> <p>As workplace relations minister <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/national/workplace-bullies-face-10000-fine-in-gillard-plan/story-fncynjr2-1226658053191\">Bill Shorten championed the changes</a>, saying they\u2019d help combat toxic work environments.</p> <p>Instead, <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/economy/employment/labors-bullying-laws-turned-on-union-pickets-20160823-gqzcav\">as the Australian Financial Review notes</a>, the laws have given bosses an important new weapon against trade unions. The article<em> </em>cites employment lawyer Stephen Jauncey, who thinks employers could now use the amendments to combat \u201ccommunity protests\u201d \u2013 even if strikers aren\u2019t involved and the protests don\u2019t involve obstructions, assault or trespass. Industrial relations barrister Stuart Wood, QC, seems equally bullish.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a need for quick, effective and cheap remedies [to end pickets] and this is a good example of someone being creative and innovative in achieving that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>How did measures intended to protect workers become a weapon against them?</p> <p>Again, the problem\u2019s one of context.</p> <p>The Fair Work Commission describes \u201cbelittling or humiliating comments\u201d as an example of bullying.</p> <p>Is it belittling to call someone a scab? <a href=\"http://www.iamll1005.org/definition_of_a_scab.htm\">The novelist Jack London certainly thought so</a>. He wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After God had finished the rattlesnake, the toad, the vampire, He had some awful substance left with which He made a scab. A scab is a two-legged animal with a cork-screw soul, a water-logged brain, a combination backbone of jelly and glue. Where others have hearts, he carries a tumor of rotten principles. When a scab comes down the street, men turn their backs and angels weep in heaven, and the Devil shuts the gates of Hell to keep him out. No man has a right to scab so long as there is a pool of water to drown his carcass in, or a rope long enough to hang his body with.</p> </blockquote> <p>Not exactly a compliment, then. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/past/issues/04jan/london.htm\">But in another passage</a>, London explained why scabs had earned such opprobrium. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To strike at a man\u2019s food and shelter is to strike at his life, and in a society organized on a tooth-and-nail basis, such an act \u2026 [is] menacing and terrible. It is for this reason that a laborer is so fiercely hostile to another laborer who offers to work for less pay or longer hours \u2026 To sell his day\u2019s work for two dollars instead of two dollars and a half means that he, his wife, and his children will not have so good a roof over their heads, such warm clothes on their backs, such substantial food in their stomachs.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s a pretty good summation of what\u2019s taking place in Abbottsford, where 55 workers have been sacked \u2013 and then invited to apply for their old jobs on terms that, in some cases, amount to pay cut of 65%.</p> <p>In the face of union protests, a contract company called Programmed has engaged temporary employees to keep the brewery operating. Those individuals are behaving precisely as London describes: they\u2019re driving down others\u2019 wages and conditions for their own benefit.</p> <p>No doubt it\u2019s unpleasant (even humiliating) for the contractors to hear themselves described as \u201cscabs\u201d (or \u201cdogs\u201d, \u201cfuckwits\u201d, etc). But the truth doesn\u2019t change according to how someone feels about it.</p> <p>The Fair Work Act defines \u201cbullying\u201d as behaviour that\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d. Is it unreasonable to dissuade strikebreakers from destroying hard-won awards? Certainly, CUB management thinks so but one suspects that most of us, if we were confronting the prospect of either unemployment or a massive pay cut, would form a different opinion.</p> <p>But the legislation doesn\u2019t make such distinctions, enabling a contractor seeking to pulverise working conditions to get an order restraining the union in the name of \u201chealth and safety\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/30/dont-let-the-election-distract-you-from-whats-happening-to-workers\">Don't let the election distract you from what's happening to workers | Van Badham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s one other point worth noting about the CUB case. In comments to the Financial Review, ETU state secretary Troy Gray explains that \u201cthis dispute is not going to turn on whether you can call a \u2018scab\u2019 a \u2018scab\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>In the real world, censorship cases are almost never solely to do with censorship. It\u2019s far more common that the people being silenced are menaced in a variety of other ways as well.</p> <p>The detainees in Nauru and Manus Island, for instance, want to have their voices heard. But much more than that, they want to be resettled.</p> <p>In the same way, the unionists at Abbottsford are being censored. But, as Troy Gray says, that\u2019s only a minor part of what\u2019s at stake. </p> <p>Again, the comparison with Bernardi and his ilk could not be greater. Could you imagine the yelps of anguish and outrage were the wages of all parliament\u2019s senators were suddenly cut by, oh I don\u2019t know, 65%?</p> <p>But, of course, that\u2019s not on the agenda. For the campaign against section 18C is being pushed by the most privileged people in the nation, a crew who invoke high principles only to obscure how little skin they have in the game.</p>",
  "<p>I was 12 years old when I was first taunted with, then refused, the opportunity to play with my twin brother\u2019s footy team. Throughout my primary school years I\u2019d trained alongside them, all those cold wintry nights, air frosty and hard as ice, or rancid with mud and overripe grass, I\u2019d steal my way into practice matches or scrimmages, kick-to-kick or backyard footy, forcing the boys to let me play, not with demands of fairness or anguished pleas, but simply by refusing to go away. </p> <p>The coach noticed, and approached the tribunal to have me listed. But footy wasn\u2019t ready for girls then, or the administrators weren\u2019t, and so the coach\u2019s appeal was thwarted, and I was deemed officially \u201cineligible\u201d. Footy, they decided, \u201cisn\u2019t safe for girls\u201d.<br></p> <p>That decision was like a fist to my gut, expelling me from the game until I found my way back, not as a player \u2013 that was dead forever \u2013 but as an observer. A one-eyed fan. The female kind. A girl in a world that was unapologetically for and about men. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/04/impressive-viewing-figures-for-exhibition-match-at-odds-to-paltry-womens-afl-pay\">Impressive viewing figures for exhibition match at odds to paltry women's AFL pay | Craig Little</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Until now. Because last week, it was all about women. Our rules. Our game. Our story.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/03/moana-hope-western-bulldogs-afl-womens-all-stars\">Saturday night\u2019s final of the women\u2019s exhibition series</a> of matches between the Melbourne Demons and the Western Bulldogs carried with it the mantle of being yet another footy first \u2013 open to the public, free and, unencumbered by competition from the AFL men\u2019s game, it was also being broadcast on prime time TV on Channel 7. It was billed as the last hope for the players not yet drafted to the 2017 women\u2019s competition. </p> <p>It was an event that meant so much to so many \u2013 except, it seemed, the media, who barely noted its approach in the days leading up to it and decried the \u201cweekend with no footy\u201d. This, despite Monday night\u2019s widely watched Australian Story episode featuring two of the stars of the women\u2019s game \u2013 on field favourite Moana \u201cMo\u201d Hope, and off-field champion, the inimitable Dr Susan Alberti \u2013 and the many events and promotions that followed.</p> <p>As one sixth of the Outer Sanctum podcast, I had more footy commitments this past week than ever, and I couldn\u2019t understand why the women\u2019s game wasn\u2019t being celebrated and promoted as widely as it deserved. To us it was monumental. It wasn\u2019t so long ago that it had seemed unthinkable. </p> <p>The whole Outer Sanctum team would be attending the game on Saturday night, as well as many of the events leading up to it, including Dr Alberti\u2019s breakfast on that Friday, the history making all-female panel on Thursday night\u2019s Marngrook Footy Show, and we\u2019d been invited to sit in on the Demons\u2019 pre-game training session. The Outer Sanctum was suddenly The Inner Sanctum, and we were thrilled. </p> <p>This was a world we\u2019d been excluded from, an opportunity never lived, for some, never even offered, and yet, there we were, watching in awed silence while these young women \u2013 these footballers \u2013 were being coached by the charismatic Michelle Cowan, as she told inspiring stories of what the game meant to women and girls everywhere, and what it should mean to the women in front of her, before taking them through the match day plan. The players watched rapt, determined. They were not going to step lightly out of anyone\u2019s way. They would chase that ball, defend their team-mates, and win the contest if it killed them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/from-the-outer-sanctum-what-its-like-to-be-called-excrement-by-sam-newman\">From the outer sanctum: what it's like to be called 'excrement' by Sam Newman | Nicole Hayes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It gave us shivers and a powerful sense of the moment. I\u2019ll admit, too, to an unexpected twang of jealousy. Despite the embarrassingly long time since the Under-12s, the sting of it was still sharp enough to bring an unwanted tear. </p> <p>Michelle\u2019s words still ringing in our ears, we headed to EJ Whitten Oval, anticipation thick in the air. The ground had a suburban feel, with deck chairs and kids running everywhere, a sense of community and togetherness around this small but significant event. The whole crowd was on the same side for once, sharing a genuine sense of joy and celebration at what was about to happen and what it represented, encapsulated in the moment when Dr Alberti made her way to her seat in the stadium to an impromptu standing ovation. It felt more like a party than a footy match. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/04/carlton-to-complain-to-police-over-alleged-womens-afl-recruitment-leak\">Carlton to complain to police over alleged women's AFL recruitment leak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And I remember, as I was weaving through the jostling crowd, pie in one hand, record in the other, hurrying to my seat before the first siren, being struck by the sheer weight of the moment. The rest of The Outer Sanctum team were already seated with the women from Joy 94.9\u2019s Chicks Talking Footy, my teenage daughters beside them, all lined up waiting to see this thing we were told for too many years would never happen. Could never happen. No one wanted to watch women play footy. No one was interested in watching amateurs \u2013 <em>a bunch of</em> <em>girls</em> \u2013 botch the game good men had worked for decades to perfect. Even as the siren sounded, there were tweets saying as much.</p> <p>Until that first bounce, when the game spoke for itself. Early in the first quarter, the Bulldogs star and marquee player, Katie Brennan, took a hard knock to the face, and was immediately helped up by the Melbourne fullback (and her Darebin team-mate), Melissa Hickey. Hope slammed six glorious goals, including one unlikely winner from the boundary. Tayla Harris nailed a 50-metre monster, and I watched a passage of footy \u2013 Carney to Vescio to Hope \u2013 that would have warmed any AFL coach\u2019s heart. Free flowing with few stoppages, the game was footy at its purist, and in response, the umpires were not booed even once.</p> <p>The numbers tell one story of this game\u2019s extraordinary success \u2013 more than one million viewers of the broadcast nationwide, six and a half thousand fans who showed up to watch, and the wildly enthusiastic commentary that followed. </p> <p>But none of the statistics matter to the little girls who played kick to kick after the match, or the women who joined in beside them. They wouldn\u2019t even have mattered to that 12-year-old girl who never got to play. The one who later became me. What did matter that night was for a single evening, it felt like the whole world wanted to be a part of this new and glorious game \u2013 footy, by and for women.</p>"
