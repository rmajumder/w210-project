  "<p>The New Horizons spacecraft has nearly finished its 16-month dispatches from Pluto, Nasa scientists said on Tuesday, as they unveiled new hints of clouds and the craft\u2019s next destination in the distant ring of the solar system.</p> <p>Researchers had found last year that Pluto has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/24/pluto-nitrogen-ice-flows-atmosphere-collapse-red-haze\"> layers of strange hazes towering</a> half a million feet (200km) in the sky, but saw none of the swirling storms that cover gas giants or the wisps of condensation that gather in Mars\u2019 thin atmosphere. On Tuesday, at the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society\u2019s planetary scientists, principal researcher Alan Stern presented new evidence that clouds may form at dusk and dawn on Pluto.</p> <p>Nasa had found seven candidates for clouds, Stern said, each \u201cquite suggestive of possible but rare condensation clouds on Pluto\u201d. He cautioned, however, that \u201cnone of them can be confirmed as clouds because all of them are very low lying, close to the surface\u201d \u2013 and outside the reach of New Horizons\u2019 instruments.</p> <p>The cloud candidates were not decked or layered like those on Earth, he added, but rather suggest a sky \u201clike it is in the western United States\u201d. That sky would be \u201c99% free of clouds\u201d, he said, but it would suggest \u201cweather on Pluto is even more complex than we imagined.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/01/plutos-perplexing-polygonal-patterns-caused-by-convection-scientists-suggest-sputnik-planum\">Pluto's perplexing polygonal patterns caused by convection, scientists suggest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clouds have a specific definition, he added: \u201cdiscrete features that are optically thick and therefore would block the surface below them\u201d. Stern said that, if confirmed, the clouds might be like a fog made of uncommon gases, like ethane, acetylene or possibly methane, that condense at dawn and dusk of Pluto\u2019s long days \u2013 each one lasts 6.4 days on Earth.</p> <p>\u201cThe first flyby has given us a fantastic taste of a very dynamic and changing environment, but it\u2019s not enough,\u201d Stern said. \u201cIn order to confirm we would have to go back with more instrumentation and more time.\u201d</p> <p>New Horizons is already well past Pluto and on its way toward a new destination, itself a billion miles beyond the dwarf planet. Stern said Nasa was only in the earliest stages of talks for a follow-up mission to Pluto, and that any mission would take time. \u201cAlthough New Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever launched, it still took it nine and a half years.\u201d</p> <p>The spacecraft already has sent an enormous amount of data back to scientists, who will finish the download from Pluto\u2019s flyby on Sunday, nearly a year and a half after New Horizons<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/17/pluto-pictures-high-resolution-image-delights-intrigues-scientists\"> became the first manmade object ever to visit </a>the dwarf planet. Analysis of some of that data, Nasa scientist Bonnie Buratti told reporters on Tuesday, showed Pluto\u2019s giant, heart-shaped region is one of the most reflective places in the solar system.</p> <p>Pluto\u2019s icy surface varies in its brightness, from nearly 100% at the heart to only 8% in other regions. Buratti said that intense brightness, like \u201cfreshly fallen snow\u201d, suggests intense activity akin to that on Enceladus, the frozen moon of Saturn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/oct/30/nasa-cassini-images-enceladus-saturn-moon\">where scientists have seen plumes erupting from a saltwater ocean beneath the ice</a>.</p> <p>The body that Pluto looks like, it turns out, is Iapetus, a \u201cstrange, very weird moon of Saturn,\u201d Buratti said, calling the moon \u201cthis world where half is very dark, sweeping up dark particles from the Phoebe ring [the largest ring of Saturn], and the other half is bright, not as bright as Pluto.\u201d </p> <p>She said these clues suggest similar activity on Eris, another dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, the distant ring of the solar system where Pluto orbits.</p> <p>New Horizons is now on its way to MU69, another object in the belt, and scheduled to come within 3,000km of it around New Years Day 2019. Researcher Amanda Zangari said that MU69 could provide a look at \u201cone of the ancient building blocks of the planets\u201d, since the belt contains the \u201cprimordial remnants of the disc that formed the planets\u201d about four billion years ago. </p> <p>Stern refused to speculate on what New Horizons would find there. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been to something like MU69,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t make predictions because they\u2019re so often wrong.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2015/jul/25/pluto-images-atmospheric-haze-nasa-new-horizons-mission-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4bxmf\"                        data-video-id=\"2343615\"            data-video-name=\"Pluto images reveal luminous haze around planet - video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/25/1437823671775/Pluto-haze-004.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-457589056\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/25/1437823671775/Pluto-haze-004.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/25/150725plutonew_KP-24840072_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/07/25/150725plutonew_KP-24840072_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/07/25/150725plutonew_KP-24840072_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/07/25/150725plutonew_KP-24840072_synd_768k_vp8-1.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/25/150725plutonew_KP-24840072.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2015/jul/25/pluto-images-atmospheric-haze-nasa-new-horizons-mission-video\">Pluto images reveal luminous haze around planet</a></figcaption> </figure>",

The report found that since the start of 2014, more than 80 children younger than four fatally shot themselves. It also found that three-year-olds were the most common shooters and victims among young children, as nearly 90 of them were killed or injured in the same period. </p> <p>Researchers at the publications used the nonpartisan research group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/23/kentucky-gun-owner-gun-violence-archive-mark-bryant\">Gun Violence Archive</a>, news reports and public sources to gather the information. The statistics also raised questions about the official US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tally of deaths by minors.

  "<p>Cabinet ministers have been given detailed warnings that the UK pulling out of the EU customs union could lead to a 4.5% fall in GDP by 2030 and the clogging up of trade through Britain\u2019s ports.</p> \n<p>The predictions were contained in a paper circulated at a meeting of Theresa May\u2019s special Brexit cabinet committee, which concluded that ministers were not yet prepared to decide whether the UK should withdraw from the EU\u2019s free trade bloc.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"71ad41a4-8857-43b5-ae8b-509afaf287cd\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"flat\"> \n    <h1>What is the customs union?</h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>The European Union is a customs union. It allows free trade between countries inside it and allows imports in to the area by setting common tariffs. The area does not just include EU members. For instance, Turkey is part of the customs union for manufactured goods but not services or agriculture. The single market involves deeper integration of free movement of people, goods, services and money. This means laws need to be aligned. Some countries have access to the single market without being members of the EU\u2019s customs union.</p>\n    </div> \n   </figure> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The 4.5% cut is the average prediction made in three studies that were carried out before Britain\u2019s EU referendum, in a move that could anger Brexit supporting MPs who believe that the old estimates are out of date.</p> \n<p>The studies, by the Treasury, the thinktank NIESR and the Centre for Economic Performance and London School of Economics, predicted the effect on the British economy if the UK was to opt for a Norway-style model. That would involve remaining inside the single market but outside the customs union, within which countries set common external tariffs and so do not require customs checks.</p> \n<p>Although the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, called for the UK\u2019s withdrawal at the meeting, the prime minister was said to repeatedly stress that she was not ready to make any final decisions on the UK\u2019s negotiating position.</p> \n<p>The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said \u2013 according to one well placed source \u2013 that while Brexit would require \u201cpolitical choices\u201d, there would also be economic consequences that had to be considered.</p> \n<p>The paper on the customs union also warned that to stand still in trade terms after a withdrawal from the bloc, the UK would need to grow trade with its 10 largest partners outside the EU by 37% by 2030.</p> \n<p>City minister Simon Kirby was asked directly by a Lords sub committee if Kirby could rule out staying in the single market or customs union, and he declined to do so. \u201cWe are definitely leaving the EU. But otherwise we do not rule anything or anything out,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Kirby, who co-owned a chain of restaurants and pubs, also said businesses had to take some responsibility for handling the risks of Brexit. </p> \n<p>\u201cI am a businessman and business is all about managing uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cAs much as we\u2019d all like to know exactly what the future brings, business make money analysing their risks and preparing contingency plans and preparing the best possible decision for their shareholders or owners. I don\u2019t think you can, in any environment, remove uncertainty.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kirby said currency fluctuations should be expected as the negotiation progressed. \u201cWhatever the exchange rate, it has an impact on some people positively and some people negatively but we do not seek, from government perspective, to influence and we fully expect markets to see a movement as we proceed down the road.\u201d</p> \n<p>The customs union paper was one of three documents presented to ministers during the cabinet meeting. The second discussed options for the UK\u2019s immigration policy after Brexit while the third examined the consequences of the country becoming directly subject to World Trade Organisation rules.</p> \n<p>Ministers were also warned that some ports, including Dover and Holyhead, which handle a lot of road freight, could be seriously clogged up if there were customs checks on vehicles transporting goods.</p> \n<p>The document said that extra infrastructure required, likely to include dozens of parking spaces for lorries undergoing checks, could not physically be built in Dover because of its cliffs.</p> \n<p>Jonathan Roberts, head of communications at the UK Chamber of Shipping, told the Guardian that removal of customs controls in 1992 \u201cstimulated huge growth\u201d of trade between Britain and its EU neighbours.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201c\u00a3120bn of goods is transported on ferries to and from Dover alone every year, and the re-imposition of significant customs checks would cause profound traffic problems near ports and could ultimately cause a reduction in trade volumes.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, Roberts argued that the fact that Europe exported more to the UK than imported from it meant there was a strong incentive for EU to offer Britain a reasonable deal even following an exit. \u201cWhether in or out of the customs union, British negotiators should treat the maintenance of unimpeded movement of trade as non-negotiable,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>James Hookham, of the Freight Transport Association, said there would be a \u201cprofound\u201d impact if there is a sudden exit from the customs union as over half of Britain\u2019s exports go to the EU. He urged Fox to talk to the individuals involved in the process so he understood any \u201cunintended consequences\u201d.</p> \n<p>Others highlighted the UK-Irish border, which is effectively invisible, warning that it would be a complex issue to tackle if it had to become a new point for customs checks.</p> \n<p>Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, said that Irish officials feared that the return of customs posts would provoke terrorist attacks. \u201cThe British and Irish governments would certainly do everything possible to minimise physical customs checks on the border \u2013 perhaps through the use of advanced technology, or simply through checking lorries at towns near the border, rather than at the border itself,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>May is under significant pressure from her own party to deliver Brexit following the vote in June, with many leave campaigners wanting to see a hard break with the EU in which the UK would leave both the customs union and single market.</p> \n<p>But she is also being challenged by backbenchers who want an open relationship with the EU. One of them, Nick Herbert, told the Guardian that the 37% figure obtained by the Guardian underlined the \u201cpainful economic cost if we allow ideology to dictate the terms\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cBanking on such a huge increase in non-EU trade in current global economic conditions would be a massive gamble that could leave us all worse off,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is exactly why we need a proper debate on the choices so that we can drive a sensible Brexit deal for Britain.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, and Fox were said to have accused officials of drawing up a deeply \u201cpessimistic paper\u201d that assumed no mitigating factors. The trade secretary told cabinet colleagues that he had received assurances from non EU countries that they would allow the UK would be able to continue trading with them on the same conditions until new agreements had been drawn up.</p> \n<p>Downing Street said they would not comment on the paper, nor give a running commentary on Brexit negotiations.</p> \n<p>The cabinet is grappling with how to approach Brexit at a time when there is growing pressure on for the government to spell out its next steps. After a fortnight in which the pound had fallen amid growing expectations of a \u201chard\u201d Brexit that focuses on controlling immigration, sterling rallied when a court heard that parliament was \u201cvery likely\u201d to be asked to ratify any what ever treaty agreement is ultimately struck with the EU.</p> \n<p>Details of parliament\u2019s potential role emerged during the third day of a legal challenge over whether ministers or MPs have the power to give formal notification to Brussels that Britain is withdrawing under article 50 of the treaty on the European Union. Pressed by the lord chief justice on whether any agreement with the EU would eventually be subject to approval by parliament, James Eadie QC, for the government, confirmed that it was likely.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cIt is ultimately dependent upon the agreement of the parties to the treaty, whether they want it to be subject to ratification or not. But as I say, the view within government is that it is very likely that this treaty will be subject to ratification process in the usual way. Most of them are. It is a pretty rare event for the things to take effect immediately upon accession.\u201d</p> \n<p>That opinion was seized on by City traders as a sign that MPs might be able to prevent a hard Brexit, pushing the pound\u2019s value up at one stage to $1.23 \u2013 a rise of almost 1%. Compared with its rate of $1.46 prior to the Brexit referendum, however, it was a small recovery.<br></p> \n<p><br></p> \n<p><br></p> \n<p><br><br></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>",

What\u2019s alarming about the FBI\u2019s \u201cface recognition unit\u201d, according to the report, is that it is \u201coverwhelmingly made up of non-criminal entries\u201d.</p> <p>The FBI database photos come from state driver\u2019s licenses, passports and visa applications, meaning police can easily identify and monitor people who haven\u2019t had any run-ins with the law.</p> <p>\u201cIn the case of face recognition, there appear to be very few controls or safeguards to ensure it\u2019s not used in situations in which people are engaged in first amendment activity,\u201d said Neema Singh Guliani, ACLU\u2019s legislative counsel.</p> <p>The ACLU recently found that police in Baltimore may have used the recognition technology along with social media accounts to <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-geofeedia-update-20161011-story.html\">identify and arrest people</a> with outstanding warrants during high-profile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/18/baltimore-police-freddie-gray-protests-report-major-shortcomings\">police protests</a> last year.

The firms have since cut off Geofeedia\u2019s special access to their data.<br></p> <p>In addition to concerns about illegal monitoring and the targeting of lawful protesters, research has found that the facial recognition algorithms can be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/08/facial-recognition-technology-racial-bias-police\">biased</a> and <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0139827\">inaccurate</a> \u2013 with serious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/04/us-police-data-analytics-smart-cities-crime-likelihood-fresno-chicago-heat-list\">consequences for innocent people</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThis technology is powerful, but it is not neutral,\u201d said Bedoya. \u201cThis technology makes mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>The FBI\u2019s own statistics suggest that one out of every seven searches of its facial recognition database fails to turn up a correct match, meaning the software occasionally produces 50 \u201cpotential\u201d matches who are all \u201cinnocent\u201d, the report said.</p> <p>Additionally, a 2012 study co-authored by an FBI expert found that leading facial recognition algorithms were up to 10% less accurate for African Americans compared with white people, the <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/letter/coalition-letter-department-justice-civil-rights-division-calling-investigation-disparate\">ACLU noted</a>. </p> <p>What\u2019s more, the flawed algorithms can amplify biased policing practices since they rely on mugshot databases that disproportionately represent people of color.</p> <p>For example, the Maricopa County sheriff\u2019s office in Arizona arrests black residents at a rate three times higher than their share of the state population, and a federal judge found that police have <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/02/06/east-valley-police-black-resident-arrest-rates/22924343/\">racially profiled Latinos</a>. </p> <p>Those disparities feed into the databases, and Arizona has no law restricting police use of facial recognition, according to the ACLU. The Maricopa sheriff\u2019s system does not even require an officer to have reasonable suspicion of a crime before searching a face in the database.</p> <p>In Baltimore, some policing strategies have resulted in tens of thousands of arrests for <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/as-mayor-of-baltimore-omalleys-policing-strategy-sowed-mistrust/2015/04/25/af81178a-ea9d-11e4-9767-6276fc9b0ada_story.html\">minor offenses</a>, with prosecutors ultimately dropping the cases. </p> <p>That means many people, the vast <a href=\"http://www.aclu-md.org/press_room/290\">majority</a> of whom are people of color, may remain in facial databases even if they weren\u2019t charged, said David Rocah, senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Maryland.</p> <p>\u201cA great many of those folks ... never should\u2019ve been arrested in the first place and were innocent of any wrongdoing.\u201d </p> <p>Advocates are \u201cplaying catch up\u201d with the technology, which has rolled out across the US with little oversight or restriction, Guliani said. \u201cThat\u2019s really a backwards way to approach it \u2026 This is already being used against communities it\u2019s designed to protect.\u201d</p> <p>Baltimore and Maricopa police officials did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Stephen Moyer, secretary of the Maryland department of public safety and correctional services, which operates the state\u2019s facial recognition database, defended police use of the software, saying in a statement: \u201cMaryland law enforcement agencies make use of all legally available technology to aggressively pursue all criminals.\u201d</p>",

The Premier League? Pah! Leicester City have been there and done that. </strong>Europe\u2019s where it\u2019s at for Claudio Ranieri and co now. Yes, the Champions League has offered Leicester some joy away from domestic troubles. They\u2019ve thumped Brugge and battled to a 1-0 victory over stylish Porto. They\u2019re top of Group G on maximum points. So they should be confident of another positive result tonight against Copenhagen then shouldn\u2019t they? Not quite. The Danish champions have also thrashed Brugge, 4-0, as well as taking a point away from Porto, in Porto. They\u2019re unbeaten all season. Their quality explains why Ranieri rested Riyad Mahrez and Islam Slimani for the 3-0 defeat by Chelsea. \u201cIn the Premier League we must be safe at the end of the year. The Champions League is now,\u201d said Ranieri, explaining that decision. \u201cAt this moment, it\u2019s a priority.\u201d</p> <p><strong>So all of Leicester\u2019s eggs have been placed in one big Champions League basket and tonight feels like an opportunity to justify that decision. </strong>It works in Leicester\u2019s favour that they\u2019re at home. Their newfound inability to defend set pieces appears to be an affliction that only troubles them on the road. They will need to be resilient against a forward line led by the hulking presence of 6ft 4in Andreas Cornelius. Cardiff fans may remember him. He cost them \u00a38m in 2013. He barely played and returned to Copenhagen where he should have stayed given that his career has progressed very nicely since. They also have an all-action captain in Thomas Delaney, who scored a stupendous volley against Brugge and a potent trickster in Kasper Kusk, who Leicester will have to keep an eye on if he starts. </p> <p>Much will be expected of Mahrez and Slimani as they return tonight. And will Jamie Vardy ram Alan Shearer\u2019s criticisms down his throat with a first goal in Europe? Stay tuned to find out.</p> <p><strong>My prediction: Leicester 2-2 Copenhagen</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T17:35:09.954Z\">at 6.35pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

And if he got the most votes then it would be my expectation of Hillary Clinton to offer a gracious concession speech and pledge to work with him in order to make sure that the American people benefit from effective government.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd it would be my job to welcome Mr Trump, regardless of what he\u2019s said about me or my differences with him on my opinions, and escort him over to the Capitol in which there would be a peaceful transfer of power. That\u2019s what Americans do. That\u2019s why America\u2019s already great.

  "<p>An essay competition to win a 127-year-old Vermont newspaper has been abandoned after not enough people submitted entries, its publisher said on Tuesday.</p> <p>Ross Connelly, who has run the Hardwick Gazette for the past 30 years, had hoped to find a new publisher through the competition. </p> <p>Applicants had to submit 400 words detailing their \u201cskills and vision\u201d for operating the Gazette, along with a $175 entry fee. Connelly said he needed to receive at least 700 entries to make the competition financially viable. He was forced to abandon the competition after the number was far lower.</p> <p>\u201cIt was scores of entries,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not come near the 700.\u201d</p> <p>People sent in essays from Canada, Australia, Italy and the UK, as well as from \u201call over\u201d the United States, Connelly said. The winner would have taken ownership of the paper and its office in Hardwick, about 30 miles south of the Canadian border. The Gazette has been based in the same building for more than 100 years.</p> <p>Applicants ranged from college journalism students, to people who were already working in the media, to \u201csome who didn\u2019t have journalism experience\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cDo I want to measure this thing by only the number of entries? No, I don\u2019t,\u201d Connelly said.</p> <p>\u201cI came away gratified that we did it. There are lots of people out there that still have a passion for print journalism and still recognise its importance.\u201d</p> <p>Connelly, 71, bought the Gazette with his wife, Susan Jarzyna, in 1986. He had previously worked as a journalist in Cape Cod but had family in Vermont and quickly settled into his role as publisher. Jarzyna died in 2011, which meant Connelly was essentially running the Gazette on his own.</p> <p>\u201cI came to understand long before she died that you need more than two people at the helm to run a newspaper of this size,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mom-and-pop operation, if you will. Mom wasn\u2019t there and pop couldn\u2019t do it all himself, so it just came to the point where I knew the newspaper needed new energy and new ownership.\u201d</p> <p>The Hardwick Gazette is a weekly broadsheet, which goes on sale every Wednesday. (Connelly was rushing to finish this week\u2019s issue when he spoke to the Guardian.) </p> <p>It has a circulation of 2,200 and costs 75 cents. Readers can save money by subscribing \u2013 $35 a year for those in Vermont, $38 for those out of state. The Gazette also has subscribers in Scotland, England and Canada. They receive their copies by airmail. </p> <p>Connelly <a href=\"http://www.hardwickgazette.com/#press-release\">launched the essay contest</a> in June, and it closed on 11 October. When it became apparent that the number of entries would not meet the total, Connelly also <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1192030243/save-the-hardwick-gazette\">launched a Kickstarter</a> campaign to \u201ctry to bridge the gap between the number of entries and what we needed to make the whole thing financially viable\u201d.</p> <p>The Kickstarter campaign also failed. But Connelly is still optimistic about the Gazette\u2019s future. When he returned the essayists\u2019 application fees, he enclosed notes inviting them to discuss buying the newspaper outright.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I had six or eight of the entrants respond,\u201d Connelly said.</p> <p>\u201cThey all look serious, and so I\u2019m hopeful once again that the new owner of the Gazette will be found.\u201d</p>",

But if anyone can be forgiven for such behavior, perhaps it should be her.</p> <p>That she\u2019s not running for president didn\u2019t stop the New York Post from running nude photos of her on the cover; or the Daily Mail from questioning the legitimacy of her immigration status; or practically everyone in media from taking a good long laugh at her expense after parts of her RNC speech were found to be lifted from a Michelle Obama script. Never mind that it wasn\u2019t her fault, that some inept speechwriter or campaign operative was almost certainly to blame.

It is not known at what point during the journey he was killed.</p> <p>Pat Breen, 65, co-owner of the Airport Cafe, said the driver had parked the lorry and approached a member of his staff. </p> <p>\u201cHe was obviously a bit panicked, saying \u2018politsky, politsky\u2019,\u201d Breen said. \u201cThe wife spoke to him, he took her over to the lorry and asked her to go into the back. In the back, she saw a leg sticking out. The person didn\u2019t seem to move or respond to any noise or shouting, so she assumed ... </p> <p>\u201cHer immediate thing was to come back and phone the police. She said she thought the person was probably dead. All the [emergency] services came.</p> <p>\u201cSince then we\u2019ve found out that the driver reported immigrants at Calais in his vehicle. The vehicle was searched, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/22/sixteen-detained-after-lorry-stopped-on-m1-in-immigrants-investigation\">they found immigrants</a> and they removed them all, apart from the one that was hidden. [The lorry] was again checked at Dover; a dog was sent on which failed to find him. And at some time, the load was shifted and he was crushed between it.\u201d</p> <p>Breen said it was clear that the pallets holding the magazines had moved during the journey, trapping the man, who had attempted to conceal himself between them.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019d gone down between the pallets, I\u2019m assuming it moved across and crushed him and he couldn\u2019t breathe,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019d disguised himself in the lorry by covering himself in these magazines, and apparently he\u2019d taken cling film off the pallets to wrap himself in, to keep warm overnight or something.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Kent fire and rescue service said firefighters had used a forklift truck to remove the load to allow officers and paramedics access to the man\u2019s body. Secamb sent two paramedic cars and an ambulance to the incident. \u201cSadly the man was pronounced dead at the scene,\u201d a spokesman said.</p> <p>Kent police issued a statement stating they were called to the scene at 8.29am. \u201cIt is believed the lorry had travelled from France and inquiries are on-going to identify the man and ascertain the cause of death,\u201d they added.</p>",

She said any cabinet minister with longstanding opposition to the chosen option <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/heathrow-or-gatwick-airport-expansion-to-be-decided-next-week\">will be permitted to dissent publicly on behalf of their constituents</a>, without campaigning against the government or speaking against it in parliament. At Westminster MPs were expecting the key vote on airport expansion to come this autumn, and the news has prompted speculation about why May appears to have postponed the Commons decision.

Five select committee chairmanships have become vacant and, in line with the Wright reforms introduced in 2010 (named after the then Labour MP Tony Wright, who chaired a committee that recommended them), the posts are filled by MPs voting in a secret ballot. Previously it used to be a whips\u2019 stitch-up. Four of the posts are contested, and nominations have just closed.</p> <p>Two of the committees chairmanships have been allocated to Labour and there is a Jeremy Corbyn effect at work; some particularly experienced candidates are standing who would not normally be standing, because in other circumstances they would be serving on the Labour front bench.</p> <p>The contest that will attract most attention is the one to replace Keith Vaz as chair of the <strong>home affairs committee.</strong> This goes to a Labour MP, and there are four candidates.</p> <p><em>Yvette Cooper, Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford</em></p> <p><em>Caroline Flint, Don Valley</em></p> <p><em>Paul Flynn, Newport West</em></p> <p><em>Chuka Umunna, Streatham</em></p> <p>This will be a fascinating contest. Cooper, a former shadow home secretary, Flint, a former Home Office minister, and Umunna, a former shadow business secretary and a current member of the committee, are all strong, mainstream candidates. Flynn, a career backbencher who briefly held two jobs in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet over the summer, is more of a maverick, but he is also passionate about the executive being accountable to parliament.</p> <p>There will also be keen interest in the contest to become chair of the new <strong>Brexit committee</strong>. Again, it has been allocated to Labour and there are just two candidates.</p> <p><em>Hilary Benn, Leeds Central</em></p> <p><em>Kate Hoey, Vauxhall</em></p> <p>Benn is strongly pro-EU, and Hoey is strongly anti, and so it is straight remain/leave fight. Given the fact that most MPs backed remain, and that he is highly respected in the Commons anyway, Benn seems a dead-cert.</p> <p>There are five candidates for the post of <strong>science and technology committee</strong> chair, which goes to a Conservative. They are:</p> <p><em>Victoria Borwick, Kensington</em></p> <p><em>Stephen Metcalfe, South Basildon and East Thurrock</em></p> <p><em>Dr Poulter, Central Suffolk and North Ipswich</em></p> <p><em>Derek Thomas, St Ives</em></p> <p><em>Matt Warman, Boston and Skegness</em></p> <p>And there are just two candidates for the <strong>culture, media and sport committee</strong>, which also goes to a Conservative.</p> <p><em>Damian Collins, Folkestone and Hythe<br></em></p> <p><em>Helen Grant, Maidstone and The Weald</em></p> <p>MPs vote tomorrow and the results will be announced in the afternoon.</p> <p>The fifth committee is the new <strong>international trade</strong> one.

Normally benefits are uprated in line with inflation, but the government has frozen most working-age benefits and tax credits until 2020, which means that higher inflation makes them ever less generous.</p> <p>Here is the key passage from its analysis.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Figure 1 shows how the size of the expected cut in generosity resulting from the four-year cash freeze has increased in the light of upwards revisions to forecast inflation. As of March 2016 the freeze represented a 4% cut in the value of those benefits affected relative to previous plans (given OBR inflation forecasts). As a result, 11.5 million families were expected to lose an average of \u00a3260 a year, saving the government \u00a33.0 billion in 2019\u201320. Given the latest inflation forecasts from the IMF, the policy now represents a 6% cut to affected benefits. The same 11.5 million families are now expected to lose an average of \u00a3360 a year (\u00a3100 a year more than expected in March), saving the government \u00a34.2 billion in 2019\u201320 (i.e. an additional \u00a31.2 billion over what was expected back in March). Greater losses are found among families \u2013 typically those on lower incomes \u2013 who receive more in benefits: for example, ignoring the 3.2 million families who only receive child benefit, the average loss from higher inflation rises to \u00a3140 per year (from \u00a3330 to \u00a3470).</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Some 11.5m families set to lose an extra \u00a3100 a year from the government\u2019s benefits freeze because of post-Brexit inflation.</strong></li> </ul> <p>And here is the chart quoted in this passage. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32901b5321d53e9fa5404da41b319ec94bba9aef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32901b5321d53e9fa5404da41b319ec94bba9aef/0_15_748_449/500.jpg\" alt=\"Increased losses faced by benefit claimants caused by inflation increases.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Increased losses faced by benefit claimants caused by inflation increases.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IFS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The IFS also says that freezing benefits has become \u201csomething of a habit\u201d for the government but that it is bad policy.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>From the benefit recipient\u2019s perspective, there is a reason that benefits are uprated in line with prices by default \u2013 since one purpose of benefits is to provide a minimum standard of living, their level should reflect the cost of purchasing the goods and services required to provide that minimum standard. While it is perfectly reasonable to argue \u2013 as the 2015 Conservative Party manifesto did \u2013 that the working age benefit system should be made less generous over this parliament, it is hard to see why the appropriate size of cut should be arbitrarily determined by the impact of movements in sterling on prices.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58060d96e4b055209adaec27\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T11:56:50.016Z\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot\u2019s story on the airports announcement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/heathrow-or-gatwick-airport-expansion-to-be-decided-next-week\">Heathrow or Gatwick: airport expansion to be decided next week</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58060b5fe4b055209adaec14\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T11:54:34.394Z\">12.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Number 10\u2019s decision to announce that it will be suspending collective responsibility over the airport expansion decision is being taken in the lobby as Downing Street all but admitting that the government will decide to go ahead with the third runway.</p> <p>This is from the Evening Standard\u2019s<strong> Pippa Crerar.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PippaCrerar/status/788343707699478528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PippaCrerar\">@PippaCrerar</a> .... which is strongest hint yet that Heathrow runway will get green light.

In particular, fiscal cuts in the context of the recent UK austerity programme are strongly associated with a higher Vote Leave share. We also produce evidence that lower-quality service provision in the National Health Service is associated with the success of Vote Leave ...</p> <p>Our regressions allow for a counterfactual analysis. We find that relatively modest reductions in fiscal cuts at the local authority level (less than \u00a350 per person) may have been sufficient to lead to the opposite referendum outcome, pushing the Vote Leave share below 50 percent. The overall reductions in fiscal cuts would have amounted to less than \u00a33 billion in total for the UK. In contrast, even major changes to immigration from Eastern Europe would have been very unlikely to sway the vote in any meaningful way. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>They claim that immigration from Eastern Europe increased the leave vote, but not immigration from other EU countries or from outside the EU.</strong> But they say reducing immigration from Eastern Europe may not have affected the result.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A reduction in migration from Eastern Europe, which could have been achieved by opting to phase in freedom of movement in 2004 (which much of the rest of Europe did), could have also reduced the margin of victory for the Leave campaign, but would have been unlikely to overturn the referendum result ...</p> <p>We also find strong evidence that the growth rate of migrants from the 12 EU accession countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 is tightly linked to the Vote Leave share. This stands in contrast to migrant growth from the EU 15 countries or elsewhere in the world. We therefore conclude that migration from predominantly Eastern European countries has had a distinct effect on voters. However, we cannot identify the precise mechanism \u2013 whether the effect on voters is mainly economic through competition in the labour and housing markets, or rather in terms of changing social conditions. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>They say that the UK\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system contributed to leave winning.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Anti-EU parties, in particular the UK Independence Party (Ukip), have seen strong popular support in European parliament elections that are based on proportional representation. However, despite significant popular support for Ukip, the party is essentially not represented in the national parliament, implying that a significant share of voters lack formal access to the political system through representation of their views. At the same time, the strong popular support has rightfully attracted media attention. But it has come with no obligation for far-right politicians to assume roles of responsibility towards their electorate by exercising executive power ...</p> <p>We argue that the \u2018Westminster bubble\u2019 is key to understanding the voting outcome. The under-representation of anti-EU parties in the British parliament is likely a crucial contributing factor to the lack of attention paid in the political process to struggling areas, especially in England and Wales. As a result of the first-past-the-post voting system, Ukip currently only has one member of parliament in the House of Commons out of over 600, despite the fact that Ukip came first in the most recent European Parliament elections. Ukip representatives are therefore hardly in positions of political responsibility and thus largely escape media scrutiny. It may therefore be appropriate to consider ways of introducing more proportional representation into British politics. </p> </blockquote> <p>But, remember, just because something gets published by academics, that does not mean it is necessarily correct. <strong>Chris Hanretty</strong>, a politics lecturer and elections expert, has published <a href=\"https://medium.com/@chrishanretty/did-austerity-cause-brexit-7051e691f0ab#.siqz2hxow\">a critique of the paper</a> arguing that the Warwick authors have confused correlation with causation.

Yet in reality they are blowing up a bubble of make-believe money to avoid immediate pain, except for penalising the poor and the prudent ...</p> <p>Some central bankers would mount a strong defence of their approach. They would explain that there is a global glut of savings, so interest rates are in any case kept low by market forces. This is true, but it does not mean those rates have to be driven to zero, or even below zero now in some places, by the authorities ...</p> <p>I have bad news for them. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/08/desperate-ecb-risks-destroying-european-project-with-negative-ra/\">The accumulating effects of loose monetary policy globally</a> are intensely political.

That said, he is tapping \u2013 uncomfortably \u2013 into something more than his supporters\u2019 most racist and violent urges: American democracy isn\u2019t working for most Americans, and Trump voters\u2019 threats are an ugly reminder that we need to fix it.</p> <p>Nearly 90% of Trump supporters agreed with a Rand Corporation <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/blog/2016/01/rand-kicks-off-2016-presidential-election-panel-survey.html\">survey</a> statement that \u201cpeople like me don\u2019t have any say about what the government does.\u201d The irony here is that Trump voters are historically some of the <em>most</em> enfranchised, with some of his strongest support coming from white protestant men. A study done during the primaries also found that Trump backers make an average of $72,000 per year, compared with a $61,000 average among likely Clinton voters. </p> <p>Most election rigging, of course, is done by Republicans through gerrymandering and restrictive voter ID laws, aimed at making it harder for poor people and people of color to get to the polls. On the whole, then, Trump voters are some of the least likely to find their ballots fall victim to foul play. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean the threat posed by his fear-mongering is any less real, or that his supporters aren\u2019t responding to legitimate flaws in American politics.</p> <p>Corporate citizens \u2013 as defined by Citizens United<em> \u2013 </em>now have an easier time getting a hold of their elected representative than just about any other American. In other words, money talks in Washington, and Super Pacs have spend just under <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/summ.php?chrt=V&amp;type=S\">$795m </a>this election cycle.

A jobless recovery from the financial crisis has left many adrift in the economy, while executives from the firms that drove it got golden parachutes courtesy of the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve.<br></p> <p>On the table now are to very different responses to these crises. Using an apocryphal quote from Frederich Engels, Rosa Luxemburg once <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/junius/ch01.htm\">wrote</a>: \u201cBourgeois society stands at the crossroads, either transition to socialism or regression into barbarism.\u201d </p> <p>The path Trump has chosen is clear: scapegoating immigrants and people of color for white political and economic woes \u2013 a script that sounds eerily similar to both 1930s Germany and the far-right\u2019s European resurgence today. Another path, though \u2013 Bernie Sanders\u2019 Democratic Socialism \u2013 garnered 12 million votes in the primaries, and continues to find voice in the social movements that helped make his campaign possible. Railing against the 1% in Washington and on Wall Street, Sanders offered an egalitarian populism to those who felt left out of the political system, not a reactionary one.</p> <p>The fight over vote rigging in 2016 is a proxy war for a much deeper crisis of legitimacy in American democracy, pitting the country\u2019s political elite against just about everyone else who lives here. Our democracy is in sore need a revolution, one that \u2013 with any luck \u2013 will be a far cry from the violent and xenophobic coup Trump\u2019s supporters are promising to bring about. </p>",

  "<p>Northern Ireland\u2019s fragile economy will be hit harder than that of any other UK region by Brexit, local forecasters say, as questions persist about who will replace hundreds of millions of pounds in EU funding.</p> <p>Not only does Northern Ireland stand to lose about \u00a3500m a year in EU funding for farmers, voluntary groups and peace projects, its exports \u2013 60% of which go to Europe \u2013 could suffer if tariffs are imposed on products imported from the UK.</p> <p>The government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/13/philip-hammond-treasury-to-guarantee-post-brexit-funding-for-eu-backed-projects\">has promised to match the current level of agricultural funding through to 2020</a>, but what will happen after that is unclear.</p> <p>\u201cWe will need to address the future of all programmes that are currently EU funded once we have left,\u201d the Northern Ireland secretary, James Brokenshire, told the Guardian. \u201cOver the coming months HMT [Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury] will consult closely to review all EU funding schemes to ensure that any new funding commitments best serve the UK\u2019s national interest.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pwc.co.uk/who-we-are/regional-sites/northern-ireland/press-releases/northern-ireland-should-avoid-recession-but-it-will-be-close.html\">Forecasters predict</a> that in 2017, the year when article 50 must be triggered, Northern Ireland will be the UK\u2019s weakest performing region, with growth of just 0.2%. </p> <p>The first minister, Arlene Foster, and deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, have urged Theresa May to be mindful of the region\u2019s unique position, pointing out that since 1984 it has benefited from \u00a311bn of EU funding.</p> <p>But the PWC chief economist Esmond Birnie said the focus on the EU funding was kicking the real problem into the long grass, and that this should be a moment for questioning whether subsidies and grants had been a good thing.</p> <p>\u201cIf the NI executive is pinning its hopes on safeguarding the subsidies, it\u2019s a mistake, it\u2019s not realistic and it\u2019s fairly important to have a plan B,\u201d said Birnie. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/29/eu-farming-subsidies-uk-cap-ceiling-england\">Farm subsidies</a>, for instance, have \u201cfossilised a sector in one period of time\u201d with little incentive to innovate \u2013 or even leave the sector \u2013 meaning missed opportunities to grow the business or make it more dynamic, according to Birnie.</p> <p>Some 38,000 farmers and rural projects shared nearly \u00a3350m from Brussels, accounting for about 70% of the region\u2019s EU money. By output, this amounts to three times the subsidies and grants given to farmers in the rest of the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d25fdb0b2c28ddab1e1d3978efaef99492ad8de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d25fdb0b2c28ddab1e1d3978efaef99492ad8de/30_136_4416_2650/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Banners in the border town of Carrickcarnon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banners in the border town of Carrickcarnon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others point out that the Brussels money is dwarfed by the money London transfers to Belfast each year \u2013 a net \u00a39bn. \u201cThe real paymaster of Northern Ireland is London, not Brussels,\u201d said Graham Brownlow, a lecturer in economics at Queen\u2019s University and co-editor of Irish Economic and Social History.</p> <p>Some sections of the public sector economy are a vestige of the Troubles. The rail and bus services remain state owned, while the management of council homes is outsourced to a housing executive because of sectarianism.</p> <p>But most of the public sector dates back to the founding of Northern Ireland in 1922 following Ireland\u2019s war of independence. </p> <p>\u201cPeople have argued that the private sector is the wealth-generating sector, and the logic being that the problem is there is too much public sector, but for Northern Ireland the public sector is more a consequence of economic failure rather than its cause,\u201d said Brownlow.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Belfast\u2019s hopes of winning an advantage over the rest of the UK, and perhaps even undercutting Ireland, by lowering corporation tax have been dashed, union officials say, because most global companies want to operate inside the EU.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d3e50ecb6ee2b97f30caf1c805a08a377a8502f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d3e50ecb6ee2b97f30caf1c805a08a377a8502f/107_332_3934_2360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May meets Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness in Belfast in July\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May meets Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness in Belfast in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Mcerlane/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The coalition in Belfast, led by the Democratic Unionist party and Sinn F\u00e9in, has insisted it will continue to press the UK Treasury for a local corporation tax rate in order to compete with the Irish Republic\u2019s 12.5% rate.</p> <p>But Peter Bunting, the northern secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, said it was pointless to cut corporation tax to 12.5%, or even 10%, and try to appeal to multinationals \u201cbecause the rivals down the road will still have access to the single market\u201d.</p> <p>Jimmy Kelly, Unite\u2019s regional secretary, described the power-sharing government\u2019s continued search for a rate as low as 10% as an \u201cunwinnable race for the bottom\u201d.</p> <p>Kelly said: \u201cPost-Brexit it\u2019s unclear whether the beggar-thy-neighbour approach to winning tax haven status will even bring FDI [foreign direct investment] to Northern Ireland.

  "<p>Two weeks ago <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/mays-conservative-party-conference-speech-key-points-analysed\">Theresa May made a statement</a> that, for many, trampled on 200 years of enlightenment and cosmopolitan thinking: \u201cIf you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It was a proclamation blasted by figures from all sides, but for Kwame Anthony Appiah, the philosopher who on Tuesday gave the first of this year\u2019s prestigious BBC Reith lectures, the sentiment stung. His life \u2013 he is the son of a British aristocratic mother and Ghanian anti-colonial activist father, raised as a strict Christian in Kumasi, then sent to British boarding school, followed by a move to the US in the 1970s; he is gay, married to a Jewish man and explores identity for a living \u2013 meant May\u2019s comments were both \u201cinsulting and nonsense in every conceivable way\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just an error of history to say, if you\u2019re a nationalist, you can\u2019t be a citizen of the world,\u201d says Appiah bluntly. </p> <p>Yet, the prime minister\u2019s words were timely. They were an example of what Appiah considers to be grave misunderstandings around identity; in particular how we see race, nationality and religion as being central to who we are.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/30/simon-blackburn-honor-code-review\">The Honor Code: How Moral Revolutions Happen by Kwame Anthony Appiah - review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Regarded as one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/30/simon-blackburn-honor-code-review\">world\u2019s greatest thinkers</a> on African and African American cultural studies, Appiah has taught at Yale, Harvard, Princeton and now NYU. He follows in the notable footsteps of previous Reith lecturers Stephen Hawking, Aung San Su Kyi, Richard Rodgers, Grayson Perry and Robert Oppenheimer.</p> <p> The \u201cMistaken Identities\u201d lectures cover ground already well trodden by the philosopher. His mixed race background, lapsed religious beliefs and even sexual orientation have, in his own words, put him on the \u201cperiphery of every accepted identity\u201d.</p> <p>But in the face of religious fundamentalism, Brexit and the need to reiterate in parts of the US that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2016/jul/10/black-lives-matter-protests-across-the-us-in-pictures\">black lives matter</a>, Appiah argues it is time we stopped making dangerous assumptions about how we define ourselves and each other. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/15/this-weeks-best-radio-reith-lectures-incredible-women\">Appiah\u2019s lecture</a> on nationality draws heavily on the \u201cnonsense misconceptions\u201d he saw emerge prominently in the Brexit and Donald Trump campaigns \u2013 that to preserve our national identity we have to oppose globalisation.</p> <p>\u201cMy father went to prison three times as a political prisoner, was nearly shot once, served in parliament, represented his country at the United Nations and believed that he should die for his country,\u201d Appiah says. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a more patriotic man than my father, and this Ghanaian patriot was the person who explicitly taught me that I was a citizen of the world. In fact, it mattered so much to him that he wrote it in a letter for us when he died.<br></p> <p> \u201cSo I know from deep experience that nationalism and globalisation go hand in hand and are not, as Theresa May has said, opposing projects. It just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p> <p>The inconsistency towards national sovereignty irritates Appiah. He points out how the importance of a person\u2019s right in the UK to \u201csettle their own destiny\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/21/boris-johnson-eu-referendum-campaign-for-brexit-david-cameron\">as Boris Johnson put it</a>, took centre stage during the Brexit campaign, but a year earlier \u201cthat same right had been denied to the Scottish people\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cWhether it\u2019s these current stories of essential Britishness, stories of times of essential Hinduness in India, or tales of a pure Islamic state, they are all profoundly unfaithful to historic fact,\u201d he says. \u201cNationality, religion, both have always been fluid and evolving, that\u2019s how they have survived.\u201d </p> <p>And when it comes to self identity, Appiah argues, race is just as misunderstood as nationality \u2013 with disastrous consequences. <br></p> <p>Society still largely operates under the misapprehension that race (largely defined by skin colour) has some basis in biology. There is a perpetuating idea that black-skinned or white-skinned people across the world share a similar set of genes that set the two races apart, even across continents. In short, it\u2019s what Appiah calls \u201ctotal twaddle\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe way that we talk about race today is just incoherent,\u201d he says. \u201cThe thing about race is that it is a form of identity that is meant to apply across the world, everybody is supposed to have one \u2013 you\u2019re black or you\u2019re white or you\u2019re Asian \u2013 and it\u2019s supposed to be significant for you, whoever and wherever you are. But biologically that\u2019s nonsense.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not new information, but for Appiah it is essential to voice it. Despite growing up mixed-race and gay in Ghana, then moving to the UK aged 11, Appiah says these supposedly conflicting aspects of his identity were never a problem for him until he moved to the US. As a student at Yale in his early 20s, others began to define him entirely by his race, and even questioned whether having a white mother made him \u201creally black\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf you try to say what the whiteness of a white person or the blackness of a black person actually means in scientific terms, there\u2019s almost nothing you can say that is true or even remotely plausible. Yet socially, we use these things all the time as if there\u2019s a solidity to them.\u201d</p> <p>Appiah is at pains to point out that, while society has made race and colour a significant part of how we identify ourselves, particularly in places such as the UK and US, it is an invented idea to which we cling irrationally. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/aug/26/highereducation.news3\">Review: Cosmopolitanism by Kwame Anthony Appiah</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Appiah\u2019s lecture explores the notion that two black-skinned people may share similar genes for skin colour, but a white-skinned person and a black-skinned person may share a similar gene that makes them brilliant at playing the piano. So why, he asks, have we decided that one is the core of our identity and the other is a lesser trait?</p> <p>\u201cHow race works is actually pretty local and specific; what it means to be black in New York is completely different from what it means to be black in Accra, or even in London,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd yet people believe it means roughly the same thing everywhere. Race does nothing for us.</p> <p>\u201cI do think that in the long run if everybody grasped the facts about the relevant biology and the social facts, they\u2019d have to treat race in a different way and stop using it to define each,\u201d he says. </p> <p>At a time when the world continues to divide itself along racial lines and where, in the US, \u201cbeing put in that black box means you tend to get treated worse and are more likely to get shot by a police officer\u201d, getting people to understand race as a social invention could, in Appiah\u2019s view, save lives.</p> <p>He is adamant that identity is not \u201cjust a philosopher\u2019s fuss\u201d and that the world bears the scars of endless crusades fought to protect it. </p> <p>\u201cMistakes about race were at the heart of the Rwandan genocide; the invasion of Iraq in 2003 was shaped by American nationalism and chauvinism about Muslims; nationality is clearly stopping us doing our part in dealing with things such as the refugee crisis, because we feel like it will threaten our own identity,\u201d says Appiah. \u201cThis crisis that we are facing now is rooted in these moral and intellectual confusions about identity.

  "<p>Theresa May was recently asked what makes her angry. She was succinct in her response: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-57f360a3e4b01506cbf24f90\">\u201cInjustice \u2026 child sexual abuse, modern slavery. When we see the powerful abusing their position</a>.\u201d</p> <p>The prime minister has been public in her concerns around slavery for some time now. She appears particularly proud of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/30/contents/enacted\">Modern Slavery Act</a>, which she and her team brought on to the statute books in 2015. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/22/4500-slavery-victims-supported-by-salvation-army-in-five-years\">has established a \u00a333m fund</a> focused on \u201chigh risk countries where we know victims are regularly trafficked to the UK\u201d. She has repeatedly stated that her government will lead the way in defeating modern slavery.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/18/70-of-migrants-to-europe-from-north-africa-trafficked-or-exploited-un-united-nations-survey\">Survey finds 70% of migrants arriving in Europe by boat trafficked or exploited</a> </p> </aside>  <p>High-level political commitment to addressing slavery is something <a href=\"http://www.antislavery.org/english/\">Anti-Slavery International</a> has long called for. So having a UK prime minister who makes slavery eradication one of her priorities is to be welcomed and is an opportunity to further advance the work many of us have been doing for such a long time.</p> <p>To make a lasting difference, May will need to broaden her perspective beyond a criminal justice response to slavery. Crucially, she will need to ensure that other policy areas that can directly impact slavery \u2013 in particular trade, development, migration and international human rights law \u2013 are not neglected.</p> <p>There is already a risk that the current anti-immigration rhetoric and the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/19/contents/enacted\">Immigration Act 2016, </a>with its introduction of an \u201cillegal working\u201d offence, will undermine the intent of the Modern Slavery Act. </p> <p>As early as 2006 Anti-Slavery International identified how enslaved people often had their migration status made irregular to increase the power that traffickers had over them, allowing them to be threatened with denunciation to the authorities and deportation. In other words, traffickers typically try to render their victims in a position of \u201cillegal working\u201d as part of the process of their enslavement. </p> <p>It used to be commonplace for victims of trafficking to report a lack of interest of the police in their plight, which, to her credit, May recognises as a considerable failure in the UK\u2019s domestic response to slavery. However, the new offence of \u201cillegal working\u201d can only lead to further confusion.</p> <p>A closer look at statistics of the<a href=\"http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/about-us/what-we-do/specialist-capabilities/uk-human-trafficking-centre/national-referral-mechanism\"> national referral mechanism</a>, the UK-wide slavery victim identification and protection system, reveals that immigration status has a huge influence on how likely a victim is to be protected. For example, of those referred to the NRM, 77% of Poles and 67% of Lithuanians were recognised as victims of trafficking in 2015, while only 11% of Vietnamese and 10% of Nigerians were equally lucky. Given this, one cannot blame a trafficked Nigerian for being hesitant to come forward as a victim.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/11/rescuing-trafficked-fishermen-cape-town-south-africa-slave-like-conditions\">Bid for freedom: rescuing trafficked fishermen as they dock in Cape Town</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was good to hear that a big part of the \u00a333m will be spent in the countries seen as the main sources of trafficking to Britain, such as Nigeria and Vietnam. Poverty and lack of opportunities in source countries are big factors behind trafficking, so development efforts should contribute to minimising those risks. However, rejecting a big majority of potential victims from those countries and most often deporting them is at odds with that approach. </p> <p>As the prime minister prepares to lead Britain out of the EU she will need to find other trading partners. India is being mentioned as one such nation, despite the fact that the wholesale failure of rule of law for millions of Dalits contributes to their enslavement, often in export-oriented industries that provide our high streets with cheap clothes. How likely is it that modern slavery considerations will feature in those negotiations? </p> <p>No doubt, by way of response to these slavery concerns in international trade, May would point to the important transparency in supply-chain provisions in the Modern Slavery Act, which were the result of intense lobbying by ethically minded British businesses. </p> <p>However, even the most robust business action cannot take the place of the essential governmental action required to establish the necessary human rights protections \u2013 in international trade policy and national business and employment regulation \u2013 that are needed to eradicate slavery from international business supply chains. </p> <p>I have no doubt May\u2019s intentions on slavery are honourable. But they will be hamstrung from the outset if she does not consider carefully how other policies can contribute directly to that cause of her visceral anger: the very positions of power that some chose to abuse. </p>",

As part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1998/apr/12/northernireland1\">1998 Good Friday agreement</a>, the Irish Republic dropped its historic territorial claim over the six counties that make up Northern Ireland. The overwhelming votes to accept the agreement in separate referendums north and south of the border was seen as having effectively settled the question of unification, for the foreseeable future at least. In the context of a still fragile peace, many dread poking that particular hornet\u2019s nest again.</p> <p>To Brian from Sligo, talk of a united Ireland in the near future is \u201cnaive and dangerous\u201d. He said: \u201cPeople forget how horrible <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/06/our-family-divided-by-the-troubles\">the Troubles</a> were and that was only 20 years ago.

For detained LGBT refugees, particularly those who are transgender, the conditions are inhumane.</p> <p>Preceding all of this is a history of oppression and marginalization. When the border was <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/guadalupe-hidalgo\">moved south</a>, Mexicans who were already living on the land found themselves labeled as aliens. In the 1930s and 40s, up to 2 million Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, regardless of citizenship status, were rounded up <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/09/08/437579834/mass-deportation-may-sound-unlikely-but-its-happened-before\">and expelled</a> from the country.</p> <p>Today, <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/study-finds-republican-voter-suppression-is-even-more-effective-than-you-think-3b2562ae2f52#.za2ibswj9\">an onslaught</a> of voter restrictions that disproportionately harms the Latino community, such as voter ID laws, suppresses the ability for Latinos to express their will in the electoral process. Our turnout isn\u2019t exactly what it could be, and English is a huge barrier for many immigrants to engaging in politics.</p> <p>And yet, despite it all, our ranks are growing. We are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/magazine/27-million-potential-hispanic-votes-but-what-will-they-really-add-up-to.html?_r=0\">registering</a> to vote. We are reshaping the electoral map, and politicians who use our existence in this country as a cudgel would do well to take note: the strategy of othering us has an expiration date. We could soon <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/07/06/its-official-the-us-is-becoming-a-minority-majority-nation\">be the majority</a>.</p> <p>There are plenty of pundits who argue that the prophecy of a powerful Latino voting bloc remains a myth, but I believe we have reason to be optimistic.<br></p> <p>That we have so far failed to activate the sleeping strength of Latino voters is not to suggest that we are not politically active or that we have never succeeded in political protest. I would point to the <a href=\"https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/important-day-us-history-chicano-moratorium\">Chicano Moratorium</a>, the largest anti-Vietnam War protest spearheaded by any minority group. It drew 30,000 demonstrators in East Los Angeles in 1970.</p> <p>I would also point to Cesar Chavez and the National Farm Workers Association. The success of the Modesto march in 1975, which started with just a few hundred people and swelled to 15,000, is a counterpoint to claims that Latinos lack the education and means to engage in political action.</p> <p>To be Latino is to inherit a rich history of resistance. Our people, so often mistreated by both sides, but especially by Republicans, are waking up. I look at young Latinos who are taking to the streets to fight for undocumented people, to <a href=\"http://www.nbclosangeles.com/on-air/as-seen-on/SoCal-Residents-Protest-DACA-Block_Los-Angeles-292210971.html\">protect Daca</a>, to free LGBT refugees <a href=\"https://voiceofoc.org/2016/05/transgender-advocates-launch-hunger-strike-to-protest-santa-ana-ice-contract/\">from detention.</a> It is a reminder that we were never truly silent, and that our voice is growing louder every day.</p> <p>We need to harness this energy and direct it to getting Latinos to the voting booth if we are to make manifest our potential in this country. That includes pushing for more Spanish-language material from campaigns,&#xa0;<a href=\"http://pages.ucsd.edu/~zhajnal/page5/documents/VoterIDLawsSuppressionofMinorityVoters.pdf\">dismantling voter ID laws</a>&#xa0;that target Latinos, and actively engaging with organizations like&#xa0;<a href=\"http://votolatino.org/\">Voto Latino</a>&#xa0;that are working to get more Latinos registered to vote. It includes talking to our family members, especially those of us who speak English and have an understanding of American politics, about why it\u2019s important to vote and why it\u2019s more crucial than ever to be a part of the electoral process.</p> <p>It\u2019s important that we do: Trump wasn\u2019t the first demagogue to use our community as scapegoats, and he won\u2019t be the last. </p>",

  "<p>In the past 12 months, Jessica Campbell has had her car\u2019s fuel line cut and its wheel nuts loosened. Late last year, she had a GPS tracker surreptitiously attached to her vehicle. She is now accustomed to being tailed by unfamiliar vehicles on Interstate 5 near her home in Cottage Grove, just outside Eugene, Oregon. Strangers have regularly come uninvited onto her property; someone even stripped the barbed wire on her fence \u201cjust to send a message\u201d. Online, she has repeatedly been threatened with rape and death. </p> <p>And last week, when she showed up at the Canyon City community hall in Grant County, she told me that someone shot at her and her entourage.

I\u2019m worried that we are going to see the same thing.\u201d The alleged <a href=\"http://[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/15/us/kansas-bomb-plot-arrest-somali.html?\\_r=0\">bomb plot</a> by militia members in Kansas, timed for the day after the election, shows the way in which those fears might be borne out. </p> <p>The Rural Organizing Project is not waiting idly for this tide to roll in. The group has just finished a statewide tour in which they presented a <a href=\"http://www.politicalresearch.org/2016/10/03/release-major-investigation-toolkit-to-aid-oregon-communities-facing-militia-movements/\">report</a> on the growth of the Patriot movement, which they collaborated on with <a href=\"http://www.politicalresearch.org/#\">Political Research Associates</a>, a thinktank that watches the far right. </p> <p>Instead of inviting people to view it online, Campbell and her colleagues went to eight rural towns and delivered the main points in a series of lectures. The tour finished late last week. </p> <p>Each event followed a pattern developed through long experience confronting those who would prefer that progressive voices aren\u2019t heard. At each stop, after Campbell\u2019s brief Powerpoint summary of Patriot movement organizing in Oregon, they invite written comments that are then read out. In Bend, one question asked about the impact of Patriot movement organizing on tourism; in Canyon City, people wanted to know about the economic roots of the far-right insurgency. Small-group discussions follow. The format is designed to de-escalate the tension that has increasingly riven small-town politics in Oregon, and to minimize opportunities for disruption.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd1e05f1ad3ea0ba7808e5364adc41e801087ece\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd1e05f1ad3ea0ba7808e5364adc41e801087ece/0_56_4928_2984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BJ Soper, a militia member, attended an event in Bend, Oregon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"606\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BJ Soper, a militia member, attended an event in Bend, Oregon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Wilson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Campbell and her crew also travel with a highly visible security detail, partly made up of Portland members of the <a href=\"http://www.aaprporegon.org/\">All African People\u2019s Revolutionary Party</a>. Earlier this year, attendees of a workshop were harassed in the carpark outside the event, and they decided that positive, protective steps were needed. </p> <p>The events are hosted by local progressive organising groups, and at the largest events, such as the one in Canyon City in Grant County, 50 to 60 people showed up \u2013 a large number in a county of about 7,000 residents. Although many who come represent the active, progressive minority in small towns, resistance to the militia movement has a way of binding people together who may disagree on a range of issues. Campbell says that the Grant County group features people from \u201cacross the political spectrum\u201d who share a concern about who is directing county politics. </p> <p>These numbers underscore something Campbell stresses: while media reports often suggest that patriots and the far right are representative of community opinion, they are frequently no more than a vocal minority. ROP\u2019s presence encourages those who disagree to the far right\u2019s prescriptions to rise above the intimidation they use to silence their opponents. </p> <p>There were clear signs that their strategy \u2013 which for now Campbell calls \u201can experiment\u201d \u2013 is working to empower locals, and even open up a dialogue with those who have been drawn into the orbit of the far right. </p> <p>In Canyon City last January, Judy Schuette heard about the plans of militia members to meet in Grant County and perhaps spread the occupation there. Schuette called for a response and a public meeting on Facebook. On the floorboards of the community hall, she recalls: \u201cI didn\u2019t know how many people would show up, and we wound up with about 70 people.\u201d</p> <p>After being formally organised in February, the group carried out several actions. They visited Harney County to show support for a protest there, and attended meetings of the county court, the local governing council, to protest increasing militia and Patriot disruption of the body. </p> <p>But ROP\u2019s tour doesn\u2019t just let them put on another big public gathering. Activists also get de-escalation training from the security detail and much-needed information about how to fight and win a long-term campaign against the rightwing insurgency in their community. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44de643b4411f16900e15a7e2cc408a0346a6a0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44de643b4411f16900e15a7e2cc408a0346a6a0c/0_0_6016_3827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Campbell speaks at an event with a security agent alongside.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Campbell speaks at an event with a security agent alongside.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Wilson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Campbell, local organisers like Schuette are the prime movers for making change in rural Oregon. </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re incredibly dedicated and brilliant. They\u2019re mostly women who care about their community. In Grant County and other counties where people are feeling that their lives could be on the line if they don\u2019t act now, that\u2019s where people are doing the best work.\u201d</p> <p>But Campbell is clear-eyed about the roots of the problem, and her diagnosis cuts through a lot of the armchair debate about where the resentment that underpins rightwing insurgency comes from. \u201cIn rural areas the conditions have been ripe for a white nationalist populist movement. Especially in Oregon where we\u2019re facing demographic shifts in a lot of places, and the economy\u2019s hurting so badly, and we\u2019ve had decades of scapegoating of people of colour as the reason why our economies are so bad.\u201d</p> <p>In some Oregon counties, as in other rural areas, libraries are shutting, and sheriff\u2019s departments can\u2019t provide 911 dispatch after dark. Dwindling services lead to a sense of abandonment. The right can easily step in and provide both a clear political narrative to explain this, and a set of simple-seeming solutions. </p> <p>\u201cThe Patriot movement is attracting people who feel disenfranchised. It\u2019s real out here, where people feel like they have not been listened to at the state level, and particularly by Democrats,\u201d Campbell says.</p> <p>The same dynamic has been driving the election. \u201cThe appeal of both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders was that they didn\u2019t feel like establishment figureheads. It didn\u2019t feel like they were going to uphold the status quo.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats, who hold a rare trifecta of both state houses and the governorship, see no point in outreach to deep red counties in the east and south of the state. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty clear that rural Oregon has been written off. We\u2019re often the only game in town.\u201d </p> <p>The focus of the tour might be the militia movement, but the real goal is addressing this sense of lost political agency. </p> <p>\u201cOur goal isn\u2019t to take down the Patriot movement. It\u2019s to build a rural Oregon where people have some access to democracy and are able to create change and have an impact on their communities.\u201d</p> <p>Helping these communities to demand the resources they need to shut down rightwing insurgencies means having a conversation with them, and not simply dismissing or scapegoating them. It also requires bravery: if you confront the far right on their own turf, you might be threatened, followed or shot at. </p> <p>We haven\u2019t all been given as big a share of courage as Campbell, the rest of the ROP, and local organizers have. But we can at least listen to what they have to say about the origins of America\u2019s rightwing surge. </p>",

American novelist Brian Selznick, a former winner of America\u2019s prestigious Caldecott medal, was picked for The Marvels, which weaves together an illustrated story beginning in 1766 with the sole survivor of a shipwreck, and a prose story set in 1990, in which a boy has run away from school to the mysterious house of his uncle. Almond said Selznick was \u201can original, a creator of books that are engrossing, mind-bending and are also beautiful objects\u201d. The Marvels, he continued, \u201cshows what is happening and what is possible in the extraordinarily inventive world of children\u2019s literature today\u201d.</p> <p>The remaining two novels on the shortlist are both contemporary: Alex Wheatle\u2019s Crongton Knights takes place on the fictional South Crongton council estate and follows a night of adventure for its hero McKay, and Australian Zana Fraillon\u2019s The Bone Sparrow is the story of Subhi, a refugee who has spent his entire life in a detention centre, and his meeting with the scruffy girl Jimmie beyond the fence. Judge SF Said called Fraillon\u2019s contender \u201cmoving and memorable\u201d, adding that it \u201cdeserves to be read by all who care about our common humanity\u201d, while Almond said that Wheatle\u2019s novel was \u201celegant, authentic and humane\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt hums with the beat of real life and the language sings from the page.

  "<h2><strong>Stunting children\u2019s lives</strong><br></h2> <p>I found deeply depressing the comment from World Bank president Jim Yong Kim about stunted children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) not reading a single letter after going through three or four years of schooling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/30/world-bank-name-and-shame-countries-fail-stunted-children\" title=\"\">(7 October)</a>. Fortunately, Peru is showing the way in addressing this dreadful problem of stunting, notably, by giving cash grants to mothers and monitoring children to ensure they are getting the nutrition they need.</p> <p>It worries me, however, that the mother cited in the article, although doing all the right things with the money to prevent stunting in her younger four, had eight children all told. Whether this was by choice or not, the fact remains that for poor families it is easier to feed two children than eight.</p> <p>Perhaps it is correlation rather than causation, but those countries that have a high incidence of stunting also have high fertility rates. Thus it would seem logical, indeed humane, to provide voluntary family planning services in association with the cash handouts and monitoring of children. Most sub-Saharan countries still have very strong cultural preferences for large families; nevertheless, if mothers could be persuaded to space their children a minimum of three years apart, it would allow for better nutrition of babies and toddlers, and indeed of the mothers themselves if they become pregnant again.<br><strong>Jenny Goldie</strong><br>Michelago, NSW, Australia</p> <h2><strong>The Dalai Lama\u2019s worth</strong><br></h2> <p>Squeezing him out is probably not the best solution, but is the Dalai Lama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-dalai-lama-dont-squeeze-him-out\" title=\"\">(7 October)</a> worth all the fuss?

And what did the Dalai Lama of the time do? Did he stay to give moral support to his people who made such sacrifices for him? No, he scuttled off out of it.</p> <p>Admittedly, the Chinese have been heavy-handed in their clean-up, but those who regret this most are probably camera-wielding tourists eager to record Tibet \u201cas it was\u201d.<br><strong>Alexandra Tavernier</strong><br>Marcq-en-Baroeul, France</p> <p>\u2022 It is despicable that the world leaders and religious leaders kowtow to the Chinese and fail to acknowledge and condemn the atrocities committed in Tibet and to outlaw probably the world\u2019s wisest man: the Dalai Lama.<br><strong>Caryl Dickson</strong><br>St Ives, NSW, Australia</p> <h2><strong>Hungarian referendum fails</strong><br></h2> <p>Thank you for providing George Szirtes a page to explain the background and contexts of the apparently ambiguous result of prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s anti-refugee referendum <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/01/hungary-freedom-viktor-orban-rabble-rousers-migrants-refugees-racism\" title=\"\">(7 October)</a>. Since a whopping 98% of those who did vote favoured the proposal, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s deputy head could claim a \u201csweeping victory\u201d over the EU \u2013 a sort of Hungarian Brexit. Except that it wasn\u2019t. By simply not voting, a majority of the Hungarian people brought it down, constitutionally: to pass, it had needed a 50% turnout and only got 43.9%.</p> <p>Szirtes was a young boy among the quarter-million Hungarians who became refugees after the heroic uprising of 1956 against the Soviet Union\u2019s puppet state. What a heartless irony that a Hungarian prime minister should seek to turn present-day refugees away. And what a strange one that he is in bed with the ruler of Russia. And strangest of all that a candidate for US president would love to join them.<br><strong>John Ridland</strong><br>Santa Barbara, California, US</p> <h2><strong>Brexit future looks bleak</strong><br></h2> <p>As Jonathan Freedland points out, there is a significant minority in the UK who did not vote for Brexit, as well as many dissenters amongst those who did, who cannot accept Theresa May\u2019s Thatcheresque posturing from a position of demonstrable weakness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/07/marching-mad-brexit-someone-speak-48-per-cent\" title=\"\">(14 October)</a>. The only visible deal to be negotiated is one of a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d that appeases both the Ukip anti-immigration faction as well as the still-dominant Merkel faction, who insist on all EU members accepting some level of free movement and acceptance of refugees. A difficult fence to straddle, if the ultimate goal is to maintain as a minimum the favoured-nation trading status enjoyed by Norway.</p> <p>May\u2019s poker hand is very short on winning cards \u2013 the bluff that the rights of current EU citizens in Britain could be at risk if Britain fails to get the terms it demands seems little short of suicidal, as the current falling value of sterling indicates. May\u2019s only recourse if her terms for a continuing relationship with the EU are rejected, would be a closer relationship with either China or the US, clearly risky options as well as being mutually exclusive.</p> <p>This is clearly a case where the longer-term national interest must take priority over individual or party interest, but where are the champions of this interest? In the unlikely event of the legal challenge to the validity of the Brexit vote succeeding, we might see a consensus of parliamentarians whose vision is broader than that of the current leadership, but without such an outcome, the future looks bleak.<br><strong>Noel Bird</strong><br>Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia</p> <h2><strong>Car travel is far too cheap</strong><br></h2> <p>George Monbiot is, of course, right to point out how we have become addicted to cars, but I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath about this changing anytime soon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/roads-car-use-health-driving\" title=\"\">(30 September)</a>. Far from \u201csitting fuming in a toxic cloud\u201d, most car journeys are actually quite convenient and cheap. And this where the problems start.</p> <p>The marginal cost of running a car is so low that if you own a car you would be mad (or really dedicated) to consider paying at least twice this to use an infrequent bus or train or even walk. We have friends who think nothing of driving a few hundred metres to visit us.</p> <p>Perhaps modern smart-card technology will eventually allow drivers to pay the full cost of their own car as they use it. In our village we have a community car club where cars can be hired by the hour at a fully inclusive rate, but it is still difficult to wean people off their own car. If the fuel duty were increased significantly this would help, but what government would have the courage to do this?</p> <p>Our behaviours that cause climate change are so embedded and habitual, and climate change is seen as so distant, that change will be difficult. If we are serious about tackling climate change we need a combination of the imaginative solutions George Monbiot describes and some real sticks (such as fuel duty increases) to fund these.<br><strong>Martin Mansell</strong><br>Lochwinnoch, UK</p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is correct that if a transportation system were designed today with the objective of moving people efficiently, it would not focus on the private automobile. However, at least in North America, our transportation systems were not designed for efficient movement, but rather for auto industry profit.</p> <p>The car companies bought up the streetcar systems of almost every major North American city \u2013 Toronto and San Francisco alone successfully resisted \u2013 in order to tear up the rails and create a market for their product.

If Ukip is dead, long live Ukip.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/18/steven-woolfe-quits-ukip-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/582tq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2816639\"            data-video-name=\"Steven Woolfe quits Ukip \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5805ea27e4b005f21833a9b8\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/18/161018Woolfe_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/18/161018Woolfe.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/18/161018Woolfe_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/18/steven-woolfe-quits-ukip-video\">Steven Woolfe quits Ukip</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Ukip could still live on in some form, of course. It could be the option on the ballot paper for those who want to hold May\u2019s feet to the fire: that\u2019s why she\u2019s been so keen to stress that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/22/brexit-means-brexit-when-is-big-question\" title=\"\">Brexit means Brexit</a>. Under the previous leadership, Labour made a miscalculation in believing that Ukip\u2019s rise represented a fracturing of the right that would benefit them. In the end, it was Labour\u2019s traditional coalition that fractured most lethally: in the direction of the SNP, Greens and Ukip.</p> <p>Ukip\u2019s turmoil certainly does underline the necessity for Labour to present a clear, coherent, inspiring vision. May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/22/theresa-may-more-trusted-than-jeremy-corbyn-britains-key-issues-poll\" title=\"\">alarmingly high poll rating</a> is only partly explained by Labour\u2019s decline: erstwhile Ukip voters flocking to the Tories is another reason. There are working-class Ukip voters who tell you they\u2019d never vote Tory; May\u2019s liberal use of \u201cworking class\u201d is an attempt to address that. A significant chunk of working-class Britain feels alienated from Labour. That has to be addressed with a clear vision and a message communicated in language that resonates with people outside the political bubble. These are febrile times and Labour has an opportunity. If the party blows it, it won\u2019t only be the Tories who are Ukip-ised \u2013 it will be a fate that befalls the whole country.</p>",
  "<p>You might say that Colin Stanbridge is in the confidence business. As <a href=\"http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/lcc_public/article.asp?aid=3979\">chief executive</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/lcc_public/article.asp?aid=3922\">London Chamber of Commerce and Industry</a> (LCCI) since 2002, he has worked for the interests of thousands of companies in the capital, most of them small and medium enterprises, over a period when even <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Financial-Crisis-of-2008-The-1484264\">global financial crisis</a> and domestic austerity failed to derail the nation\u2019s principal economic locomotive. Now comes the turbulence of Brexit. Stanbridge remains upbeat. </p> <p>\u201cBusinesses, especially the smaller ones, are very pragmatic,\u201d he says. It is the very first thing he says when asked about the impact of the Leave vote, sitting in his office in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Street,_London\">Queen Street</a> in the Square Mile. \u201cThey may well have been shocked, as many people were, that the vote across the country went the way it did, but I have absolutely no doubt that they will find a way through and that London will find a way through.\u201d</p> <p>The optimistic note is struck against a pessimistic backdrop. The <a href=\"http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/lcc_public/article.asp?aid=6185\">most recent of the LCCCI\u2019s regular Capital 500 surveys</a>, conducted by ComRes during August, unearthed continuing deteriorating expectations that had begun in the run-up to the EU referendum and are now projected into the future. The survey found that during the third quarter of this year, both domestic and export demand for goods and services fell, as did employment levels. It concluded that \u201con balance, 9% of London businesses expected their overall company prospects to decline, moving into negative territory for the first time\u201d.</p> <p>Stanbridge has called for \u201csolid reassurance\u201d from the government and warned against complacency: \u201cAs we said in our <a href=\"http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/docimages/14720.pdf\">Brexit response</a>, no one is panicking. However, there are serious issues the government needs to recognise.\u201d For him, the opportunity side of the Brexit balance sheet is largely about concentrating minds on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/oct/15/theresa-may-brexit-strategy-could-depend-on-giving-london-more-autonomy\">London\u2019s strengths</a> as a business environment and the value of making them stronger. </p> <p>As employers weigh the pros and cons of re-locating, Stanbridge asks out loud if they really want to ship out to Stuttgart. Or even Paris: \u201cWe have a huge number of advantages in terms of the language, the legal system and, actually, very importantly, as a place to live.\u201d The Chamber is urging support for exporters and has renewed long-standing calls for decisive further investment in transport capacity and for <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/colin-stanbridge-forget-scotland-london-needs-more-power-9276670.html\">greater devolution</a> of powers to London government. </p> <p>The cry is to press boldly ahead with Crossrail 2 <em>and</em> a <a href=\"http://www.ciht.org.uk/en/wra/news/index.cfm/transport-chiefs-look-ahead-to-crossrail-3\">Crossrail 3</a>; <em>and</em> with new river crossings in the east; <em>and</em> with airport expansion - not just one more runway, <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/colin-stanbridge-if-we-mean-business-we-must-expand-both-gatwick-and-heathrow-10017904.html\">but two</a>!: \u201cWe need these things. We need them more than ever.\u201d Stanbridge says he wrote to Sadiq Khan and had a meeting with him, urging him to revisit and enlarge on the work of the London Finance Commission (LFC) set up by Boris Johnson, which argued for giving the mayor and the boroughs direct control over the use to which all property taxes raised in the capital were put. Khan, already a convert, did just that. An <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/london_finance_commission_interim_report_october_2016_v1.0.pdf\">interim report</a> by LFC2 concludes that there is also \u201cscope to devolve an assigned share of one or more major national taxes,\u201d as a way of facilitating growth, making a better job of tackling deprivation and taking \u201csteps towards a better-run country.\u201d </p> <p>And then there\u2019s the the question of labour. \u201cIn our round table discussions with members, the message about talent and migrant workers and the necessity of having those workers in London is huge. We have to find some way to keep them or London will be severely damaged,\u201d Stanbridge says. An advocate of introducing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/jul/11/the-case-for-a-more-independent-post-brexit-london-is-gaining-strength\">London-specific work permit or visa</a>, he accepts that the case for foreign migration can be difficult to make. Politicians will speak up for wooing the highly-skilled and qualified but not \u201cthe people who keep the hospitals clean and make the Underground run. They may not be, in those terms, highly-skilled workers, but they are vital.\u201d </p> <p>Anticipating objections that London business favours a liberal line on overseas labour because they provide a source of cheap labour, he speaks of his own ancestry: Polish, three generations back, settling in Liverpool. \u201cIt\u2019s about the city I want to live in. Some people get angry that they come off the Tubes and buses and don\u2019t hear an English accent in the shops, but I think that\u2019s great. As a citizen of London, I want it to be a city that says, \u2018You know what? You come here, you work hard, you pay your taxes, you are law-abiding, then you are a Londoner.\u2019 If we lose that, it\u2019s bad for the city.\u201d</p> <p>Stanbridge dismisses the idea that the Brexit negotiations should be approached as \u201csome kind of poker game\u201d in which the UK\u2019s hand must remain fully concealed. For him, the broad outline of the best possible deal is already perfectly clear, and London should be at the heart of striking it: if you can\u2019t have full access to the single market and the free movement of people at the same time, then you bargain for the nearest to both you can get. It\u2019s about pragmatism. It\u2019s about confidence. It\u2019s about doing business. </p>",
  "<p>While the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/14/modern-slavery-act-explained-business-responsibility-supply-chain\">Modern Slavery Act</a> consolidated and improved our modern laws on trafficking and slavery, it didn\u2019t create any jurisdiction for the crimes of slavery or forced labour that are committed by UK nationals or companies overseas.<br></p> <p>If a British person or company holds a person in slavery or forced labour abroad \u2013 such as on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/24/un-gives-qatar-year-end-forced-labour-migrant-workers\">construction sites</a> in the Gulf states or in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/10/supermarket-prawns-thailand-produced-slave-labour\">fishing industry</a> \u2013 they can do so with impunity, unless their behaviour is criminalised in that state. </p> <p>Yet any profits obtained from the slavery and extreme exploitation of workers can filter home to the UK company, crime-free.<br></p> <h2>Making slavery a crime everywhere</h2> <p>Having worked and advised extensively at a high level on the legal issues of modern-day slavery for well over a decade, I believe new legislation is required to criminalise slavery and forced labour committed overseas and impose harsh criminal penalties in the UK.<br></p> <p>At present the only requirement on companies under the act is to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transparency-in-supply-chains-a-practical-guide\" rel=\"nofollow\">write a statement</a> showing their efforts to eradicate slavery in their supply chain and publish it on their websites. </p> <p>I can imagine that business will say that is sufficient. But as consumers we need a stronger incentive for companies to confront and prevent slavery in the supply chains they receive goods and services from. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/apr/03/modern-day-slavery-explainer\">Modern-day slavery: an explainer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Extending our criminal law to cover cases where UK-based or UK-linked businesses intentionally or recklessly engage in slavery or forced labour in their supply chains overseas would plug the gap. </p> <p>Let\u2019s not forget that it is often in countries where there is a weak rule of law or an absence of fair worker rights that slavery, forced labour and trafficking thrive. </p> <p>The law currently says if we commit a slavery crime, we will be punished. Why not then the UK companies and individuals who are engaged in supply-chain slavery overseas and profit from the labour of the enslaved?</p> <h2>Abolishing the slave trade</h2> <p>The fact that we need to change a law that only recently came into force is not unusual or unprecedented. If we look back in history we see that all of our slavery-related legislation has had an incremental approach. There were dozens of pieces of English legislation that finally enabled the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade in all of its form 200 years ago. </p> <p>It is only through seeing the law in action that we recognise where the gaps lie. The UK criminal offence of holding a person in slavery or requiring a person to perform forced labour was only passed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/71\" rel=\"nofollow\">in 2009</a>, when the legislation gap was exposed by one of my cases, and it soon became the most successful modern criminal legislation geared towards prosecuting and convicting those who enslave. </p> <p>We already have extra-territorial jurisdiction for some very serious crimes. If we think about child sexual exploitation cases involving British people, such as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2014/dec/19/simon-harris-british-citizens-child-abuse\">Kenya</a>, these people can be prosecuted in the UK. The crime of torture can be prosecuted here too, wherever it took place. Corporate acts of slavery and forced labour abroad need to be treated with the same seriousness.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>We also have the resources ready to investigate companies. Police forces in the UK, admittedly some better than others, have expertise in trafficking and cross-border investigations. They would be able to investigate the slavery complaints of overseas victims and track slavery and forced labour in the overseas supply chains of UK companies, if the legislation could be extended.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/07/cheap-seafood-fish-slavery-solutions-thailand-human-rights-abuse\">Our love of cheap seafood is tainted by slavery: how can it be fixed?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Letting victims seek compensation</h2> <p>As well as holding UK companies operating overseas accountable, we also need to extend our domestic slavery law to allow victims of slavery and trafficking in the UK to properly sue their enslavers and traffickers for civil compensation.<br></p> <p>Victims can currently seek compensation in the UK via existing laws. But these traditional compensation laws don\u2019t cover the full spectrum of harm done by traffickers and enslavers, including their use of subtle yet terrifying means of control, psychological abuse and damage, deception, coercion, the destruction of one\u2019s identity, taking a child into slavery, or debt-bondage.</p> <p>If victims had a clear right to civil compensation under British law for slavery, trafficking or forced labour they could bring a claim for damages against those responsible and it would also have a very serious impact on making businesses more accountable for slavery in their supply chains, as well as those individuals who enslave and traffic. The vast majority of trafficking and slavery cases don\u2019t end up in the criminal courts after all.<br></p> <p>In the US there is already a direct civil remedy for trafficking and forced labour in law, introduced <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/j/tip/laws/61130.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">in 2003</a>. It was designed to give compensation to victims but also act as a deterrent. In my experience, the best compensation laws for trafficking take this two-pronged approach.</p> <p>Recently, a US company Signal International was found liable and <a href=\"https://business-humanrights.org/en/signal-international-lawsuits-re-trafficking-of-indian-workers-in-usa\" rel=\"nofollow\">forced to pay compensation</a> to trafficked workers it deceived, indebted and abused on its construction sites after Hurricane Katrina. After losing a court case under the trafficking compensation laws the company later filed for bankruptcy. It was a chilling warning to companies across the US that they are liable for all the trafficking-related harm done to their victims.<br></p> <p>Civil compensation laws in the UK should be similarly clear: if you traffic or enslave people you will pay your victims for the harm you have done. We now need to modernise our Modern Slavery Act to do just that.</p>",

  "<p>There is one certainty as we survey our future: Britain must go through a highly complex and unprecedented procedure to detach itself from Brussels after more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/a-timeline-of-britains-eu-membership-in-guardian-reporting\" title=\"\">four decades of European Union membership</a>. The nation may have voted to leave, but there are many possible ways forward. So there must be torturous talks over several years with 27 states all seeking to protect their own interests, and the outcome felt in homes and firms across the country.</p> <p>The negotiation results will shape our nation for decades. They could lead to the break-up of the union, disrupt sectors of the economy and alter Britain\u2019s standing in the world. It is little surprise there are strong feelings on both sides of this debate over the best way forward given the hopes and fears. Yet suddenly there seems to be a sense of panic among those that pushed for this break as they close down discussion over the seismic consequences of the electorate\u2019s decision.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Brexit camp fought under the banner of democracy and sovereignty.

But ministers refuse to discuss Britain stance on departure deals, while politicians proposing that parliament should have a say are accused of subverting the will of the people.</p> <p>I have sympathy for the prime minister, trapped by the electorate\u2019s self-destructive verdict and swirling political realities. Clearly, divisions fuelled by the referendum are worsening, inflaming reluctance among leavers to accept challenge to their one-eyed view of the world after a shock victory. I saw this at the Tory party conference, where as someone opposing the idea of our nation turning inwards, I was constantly accused of being a sore loser.

Which is true.<br></li> <li>If the government had not welched on the deal, the Adler would have come into the country with the <strong>lowest possible rating</strong>. </li> <li>Leyonhjelm still wants the ban lifted. He believes the Adler should be in the lowest category \u2013 which would make it most accessible.</li> <li>Labor thinks the ban should stay in place but have not committed so far to whether it should be let in by state and feds. </li> <li>I am seeking an answer from the government on which category the Adler should be in. </li> </ul> <p>So there are two issues:</p> <ol> <li>Should the Adler be allowed in at all?</li> <li>If so, what category should it be in?</li> </ol> <p>This has allowed many straw men to flourish.</p> <p>The National Firearms Agreement \u2013 or the Howard gun laws \u2013 will still be in place, no matter what the outcome for the Adler. <strong>Because this is the framework for the gun laws.</strong></p> <p>This means that the government can say rightly they are still committed to the Howard gun laws.</p> <p>But if the Adler is allowed in on the lowest category \u2013 as Leyonhjelm wants \u2013 there will be a more lethal weapon available to ordinary shooters.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T05:47:41.842Z\">at 6.47am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5805a37de4b0cd26ff71e324\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T04:23:51.656Z\">5.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>AHRC president <strong>Gillian Triggs</strong> is being asked about <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s18c.html\">complaints made under s18C of the Racial Discrimination Act</a> in Senate estimates.<br></p> <p>Triggs notes that <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s18d.html\">s18D provides an exemptions</a> for works that are done reasonably and in good faith.

What that meant was that, in the views of many law enforcement officials,<strong> the 1996 National Firearms Agreement</strong>, <strong>John Howard\u2019s</strong> gun laws if you like, had not kept up with technology. </p> <p>There was a need for the Council of Australian Police Ministers, justice ministers, the law, crime and community safety council to consider this matter and the commonwealth has sought for them to reach consensus and reclassify these lever-action guns. </p> <p>Because there had been a failure to reach that consensus, the government imposed a ban on importing lever-action shotguns of more than five rounds. So that was not designed to weaken or vary John Howard\u2019s gun laws. </p> <p>It was to hold the ring and prevent the lever-action guns of that capacity to be imported at all. That ban had a 12-month duration. When it came up for expiry, it was renewed.

It seemed like a good idea at the time but, after the election, the government benches were whittled back to a one seat majority. </p> <p>The two bills would establish a Australian Building Construction Commission and regulate registered organisations, ie unions. Today the first bill returns to the house, in a neat two-step following <strong>Bill Shorten\u2019s</strong> endorsement of former Health Services Union official <strong>Kimberley Kitching </strong>and an outbreak of factional farnarkling. </p> <p>In an interview with <strong>Fran Kelly</strong>, Turnbull has, on the one hand, attacked union thuggery in the CFMEU and, on the other, endorsed the bills as a great thing for the health of unions. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is not anti-union. This is not union busting. If the Labor party were to support this legislation, they would build public confidence in the unions, because the unions would be run in accordance with the law.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kelly asks, why not get the Australian Securities and Investment Commission to regulate unions as they do the banks? Why bust unions and not banks? Turnbull says the government is doing lots on the bank front and now they are doing lots on the union front. He is an equal opportunity regulator.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Right across the board, what we\u2019re doing is addressing the issues that have been raised and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in the industrial relations field too.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>Overnight, you might have seen <strong>David Leyonhjelm</strong> has raised the prospect of horse trading over the ABCC bill. He wants a ban lifted on the importation of the Adler shotgun. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The regulation of firearms is dealt with by Coag in effect, by states and territories and the commonwealth working together and so the importation <strong>ban on the lever-action Adler shotgun, over more than five rounds,</strong> was introduced and has been maintained because of a failure to date of that state and territory group to reach a resolution on it. </p> <p>So it is a collaborative effort. But I want to stress to you ... we have among the most, if not the most rigorous laws on the regulation of firearms in the world. It\u2019s one of the great achievements of <strong>John Howard</strong>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fran: The world\u2019s leading human rights body is accusing your government, our government, of torture. You need to respond to that, don\u2019t you?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, I reject that claim totally, it is absolutely false ...

Theresa May has indicated that, though both Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU, the English and Welsh majority in favour of leaving must prevail.</p> <p>I was born and raised in Dublin and have worked and lived for 50 years in England, so I have watched with delight the transformation of relations between the people of the Irish south and the English. The Ireland of my youth was deeply resentful of its former colonial master. \u00c9amon de Valera, who was taoiseach for most of that time, refused to recognise the partition of the island and attempted to isolate Ireland from England and to revive a nostalgic, inward-looking concept of Gaelic culture. Yet despite diplomatic tensions, De Valera pragmatically pursued a fixed exchange rate with the UK, and free movement of people between the countries continued.</p> <p>A transformation in relations between the two countries began in the 1960s when De Valera\u2019s successor, Se\u00e1n Lemass, broke the isolation by signing a free trade agreement with the UK, and visited Northern Ireland, to the consternation of the young Ian Paisley. And when Britain and Ireland joined the EU together in 1973, it brought extensive economic benefits for both, and closer political engagement than previously thought imaginable. The 30-year quasi-civil war in the north was eventually ended by the Good Friday agreement in 1998. The Dublin-London air route is now the busiest in Europe, and even throughout \u201cthe Troubles\u201d, free movement of people was never restricted.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I came to England I found a country starting to realise Europe was the only response to the demise of empire</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Brexit, if it includes withdrawal from the single market and the customs union, could put these remarkable achievements at risk because border controls will have to be established between the UK and the EU, and the free movement of citizens between the two countries would be hard to maintain. The imposition of tariffs could have devastating consequences for trade. Ireland is the UK\u2019s fifth largest market, so politically and economically, there is a lot at stake.</p> <p>If the British government maintains its present stance, some severe institutional changes will have to be considered. A hard border would reverse the radical changes introduced by the Good Friday agreement and might even trigger a return to the political tensions of the past. As a result of that agreement both the north and south have benefited enormously from new EU funds (a situation that will of course end in the&#xa0;north after Brexit).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8a8dc84698e6f98ba3a866a8ef71a39a05a532b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8a8dc84698e6f98ba3a866a8ef71a39a05a532b/1039_0_3899_2339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Irish taoiseach Enda Kenny with Theresa May in Downing Street just a month after the referendum vote.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Irish taoiseach Enda Kenny with Theresa May in Downing Street just a month after the referendum vote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A more drastic and highly unlikely option would be for Ireland to follow the UK and withdraw from the EU.

The north could retain a federal link within the UK, but the links would inevitably weaken; and a possible shift towards Irish reunification would alarm unionists, who would fiercely resist such a proposal.</p> <p>The Ireland of my youth was bedevilled by twin negative emotions: nostalgia for an idyllic rural past, which in truth had never existed; and resentment against the historic cultural dominance of England.

  "<p>Buried in the 113 subsections and 12 schedules of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/higher-education-and-research-bill\">2016 Higher Education and Research Bill</a> that is currently before parliament are massive constitutional changes that will undermine the autonomy and vigour of Britain\u2019s universities and its research base. The issues are complex, and involve perturbations of the difficult balance of power, democracy, expertise, and academic freedom that will seem intangible to many. But institutions and processes that have been of demonstrable value to this country for decades and, in some cases, centuries, will be significantly eroded if this bill passes through parliament unamended.</p> <p>As it stands the bill envisages far-reaching changes to the organisation of universities and research. It establishes the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF), an assessment exercise based heavily on a variety of simple metrics with questionable relationships to teaching quality; it lowers the threshold that private providers must meet to become degree-awarding universities; and it will create a super-research council \u2013 UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) \u2013 led by a powerful chair and chief executive to oversee the near-totality of publicly funded research in the UK. Never before in the history of British science have so few individuals been been responsible for so much spending</p> <p>Of course, it is healthy to seek to review and improve how we do things, and the government has mandate to deliver manifesto commitments to introduce the TEF and the revamp of the research councils envisaged in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nurse-review-of-research-councils\">Nurse Review</a>. At the same time, it should be borne in mind that Britain is an established world-leader in research. We have an efficient system of oversight that delivers more high-impact research per pound invested than any other country. Our universities are also among the best \u2013 we have <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2016/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank_label/sort_order/asc/cols/rank_only\">ten institutions among the top fifty in the world</a>. </p> <p>Nor should it be forgotten that our research base and our universities are vital parts of the economic, political and cultural life blood of this country and have been for hundreds of years. But this bill, in its present form, threatens to undermine them both. </p> <p>The reputations of our universities and our research base are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/16/university-funding-brexit-eu-freedom-of-movement\">already under threat</a> because of the fallout from the EU referendum result, which is making the UK an unfriendlier place for overseas scholars and students, as well as cutting off access to an important stream of research funding and to a vibrant and well-developed ecosystem for collaborative work. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/16/university-funding-brexit-eu-freedom-of-movement\">Britain has a proud academic record. We must not let Brexit devalue it | David Willetts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In such circumstances we need to think very carefully before making changes. </p> <p>Let me take the universities first. The Higher Education and Research Bill creates a powerful new body, the Office for Students (OfS) with the power to override university Royal Charters, and remove the right of institutions to award degrees or even to call themselves universities. All of this the OfS will be able to do without parliamentary scrutiny. The change is motivated by the government\u2019s desire to enable new providers to enter the market \u2013 which the bill makes easier than at present by lowering the threshold requirements \u2013 and to be able to regulate that market by excluding providers that don\u2019t perform to the required standard. </p> <p>There is sense in having this degree of flexibility \u2013 and existing institutions should welcome high-quality competition. But this bill is a blunt and dangerous instrument for enacting that policy because alongside the power granted to the OfS to control the very existence of universities, it confers unprecedented powers on the Secretary of State to give instruction on what courses universities may teach. To quote the bill directly, Part 1, Section 2 states that \u201cthe OfS must have regard to guidance given by the Secretary of State\u201d, guidance that \u201cmay be framed by reference to particular courses of study.\u201d</p> <p>While there are some safeguards in the bill to protect the freedom of universities to determine course content and methods of assessment, we should make no mistake: this is a new level of interference in university autonomy. It will have a chilling effect when combined with the power of the OfS to determine whether universities have the right to exist. The bill places undue power in the hands of government and erodes institutional autonomy and academic freedom. </p> <p>It may well be that Jo Johnson, the present minister for universities and science, does not envisage ever using these powers to direct universities in what they will teach, but this is bad law. Such power, once created, becomes open to misuse and we cannot simply proceed on trust. We need full protection of university autonomy to be built into the DNA of this bill.</p> <p>The powers granted by the Higher Education and Research bill are all the more worrying in light of recent government actions which have taken an authoritarian turn. At the Conservative Party conference the home secretary raised the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/government-faces-backlash-from-business-leaders-over-foreign-workers\">naming and shaming companies that hire overseas workers</a> \u2013 a message that was not lost on the university sector, even if it has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/09/plan-to-force-firms-to-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers-abandoned\">now been abandoned</a> as a formal policy proposal. Then there was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/lse-brexit-non-uk-experts-foreign-academics\">spat between the Foreign Office and the London School of Economics</a> about the exclusion of non-UK academics from work on the implications of Brexit, which was followed by news that the Department of Education will require any researcher using statistics from the National Pupil Database to <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/academics-must-show-research-to-government-two-days-before-publishing-say-new-dfe-rules/\">submit work to them forty-eight hours before publication</a>. Further concern has been aroused by the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/ministers-hide-report-on-migrant-numbers-dv8dbj7cz\">government\u2019s attempt to bury its own report</a> showing that only a tiny fraction of overseas students abuse the terms of their student visas. </p> <p>For the sake of our democracy, we need a university sector that retains the independence to stand up for evidence and to stand up for academic freedom. This bill is a direct threat to the autonomy of our existing institutions and needs to be amended. The secretary of state should not be granted powers to guide the university curriculum. Decisions by the government-appointed OfS on whether an institution can continue to operate as a university should be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny. </p> <p>Part 3 of the Higher Education and Research Bill raises further disquiet about the governance of the UK research base. </p> <p>Over the past 100 years the UK has developed a complex and supple system of oversight \u2013 enshrined in legislation and in custom and practice \u2013 in which robust lines of communication operate across different levels, from researchers on the ground, through research council chiefs, and all the way up to the secretary of state. </p> <p>But this bill legislates for a downgrading of the research councils. They are no longer councils but committees. They will lose the protection of their Royal Charters. And their chief executives will not, <em>ex officio</em>, have a seat on the board of the powerful new over-arching council, UKRI. </p> <p>The bill does not even provide for the creation of an executive forum that would allow the heads of the new research committee to communicate the views of their researcher communities to the CEO of UKRI. Although a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-and-research-bill-uk-research-and-innovation\">supplementary document</a> published just last week by the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) now envisages such a committee, the system of governance is significantly more top-down than before. </p> <p>Perhaps, as Sir Paul Nurse intends, the new arrangement will create a powerful voice for science at the heart of government (although UKRI board appointments have to be approved by the secretary of state), while freeing research committee heads from interactions with government that distract from the job of fostering research in their designated areas. That said, none of the present Research Council chiefs has complained about having a direct line of communication to the minister. Much will depend on the individuals involved in the new regime. </p> <p>Moreover, from before the middle of the last century science\u2019s influence in government has had multi-polar characteristics. Heads of autonomous funding councils, Whitehall chief scientists, learned societies, academics, and even campaign groups have together worked with, and sometimes against, government to protect the research base. This can never be the task of one or two individuals, yet the proposed arrangements invest a great deal of power in the chair and chief executive of UKRI.</p> <p>The concerns about weakening of important consultative mechanisms are amplified by the power the bill awards to the secretary of state to create and abolish new committees, and to add or subtract from the disciplinary fields that they are encouraged to support. According to the bill these changes can be made through statutory instruments that must be placed before parliament, but such instruments are used so frequently that that they <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://wonkhe.com/blogs/analysis-concerns-ukri-blueprint/\">typically receive little scrutiny</a>. </p> <p>Of course, the remit of UK research committees should always be kept under review. Research is a fast moving endeavour and it is right to ensure that decision-making can respond flexibly. But the authority granted by the bill to the secretary of state marks a turn against a long-standing practice of consultation with the expertise and experience of the research community. And while the present minister seems unlikely to be minded to misuse the new powers accorded by the bill, its formulation is open to future abuse. The bill should be amended to ensure adequate consultation and proper parliamentary scrutiny before any changes to research committee remits are enacted. </p> <p>It\u2019s not to late.

  "<p>There is a chill over schools this October and it\u2019s more than an autumnal breeze. Two intrusive new rules issued by the Department for Education have caused consternation among schools, academics and journalists \u2013 giving an early version of the spine-tingling normally reserved for Halloween.</p> <p>The first is an edict that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/26/parents-boycott-requests-childrens-country-of-birth-information\" title=\"\">schools should record the nationality and birthplace of every child</a> and send them to the government. Schools were told in the summer, but a fuss erupted this month (including the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BoycottSchoolCensus?src=hash\" title=\"\">#BoycottSchoolCensus</a> campaign) as the collection date drew closer and schools sent poorly worded letters to parents, in some cases asking all foreign nationals to report to the school with their passports. In reality, schools do not need to ask for documentation and parents are under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/08/boycottschoolcensus-why-parents-are-refusing-to-reveal-their-childs-nationality\" title=\"\">no obligation</a> to answer. But given this happened in the same week that the home secretary announced plans to have all companies list their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/09/plan-to-force-firms-to-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers-abandoned\" title=\"\">foreign workers</a>, fears grew that this was part of&#xa0;an immigrant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/27/ministers-immigration-crackdown-education-tourists\" title=\"\">witch-hunt</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/27/ministers-immigration-crackdown-education-tourists\">Ministers planning immigration crackdown on 'education tourists'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a sensible reason for collecting more information about children. Government data on ethnicity is limited. Attainment data groups all \u201cblack\u201d pupils and, when looked at in this way, we hear how \u201cblack\u201d pupils on free school meals get better exam results than their counterpart \u201cwhite\u201d pupils. But this masks huge differences within the group. For example, black Igbo speakers \u2013 typically from Nigeria \u2013 have a very high average GCSE pass rate, while black Portuguese speakers \u2013 typically from Angola and Guinea-Bissau \u2013 have a very <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/focus-on-white-pupils-hides-ethnic-minority-under-achievement/\" title=\"\">low one</a>. It does make some sense for the DfE to seek more specific information for the purpose of better analysis and targeting resources.</p> <p>What\u2019s not clear, though, is why potentially useful data on children\u2019s home language has become mixed with questions about their nationality and birthplace. According to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/09/illegal-migrant-children-denied-access-education-housing\" title=\"\">Coram Centre</a>, about 60,000 children born in Britain, with British birth certificates, are nevertheless not British. A common reason is that their parents entered on a visa that has now expired, meaning the child does not automatically have British citizenship. So a question of nationality that is easy for some families is difficult for others.</p> <p>The risk is that parents afraid their child might get caught out could remove the child from school rather than put the family at risk of deportation. Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted, has already warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jul/14/missing-children-risk-of-exploitation-ofsted-michael-wilshaw\" title=\"\">children kept away from school are at greater risk of exploitation</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/08/boycottschoolcensus-why-parents-are-refusing-to-reveal-their-childs-nationality\">#BoycottSchoolCensus: why parents are refusing to reveal their child's nationality</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thankfully, after a public fuss and a clever campaign by <a href=\"https://www.schoolsabc.net/\" title=\"\">Against Borders for Children</a>, the DfE has formally agreed with the Home Office that this year\u2019s information will not be passed on for the purpose of <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/pupil-nationality-data-is-safe-with-us-says-government/\" title=\"\">immigration checking</a>. But I wouldn\u2019t bet against it happening in future. Children\u2019s details have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/12/individual-childrens-details-passed-to-home-office-for-immigration-purposes?CMP=twt_a-education_b-gdnedu\" title=\"\">passed by the DfE to the Home Office</a> for&#xa0;immigration purposes already. And in 2013, the government considered trying to ban the children of illegal immigrants (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/27/ministers-immigration-crackdown-education-tourists\" title=\"\">\u201ceducation tourists\u201d</a>) from schools \u2013 until it realised this would contravene UN rules.</p> <p>The second chilling announcement signalled that the government intends to <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/academics-must-show-research-to-government-two-days-before-publishing-say-new-dfe-rules/\" title=\"\">restrict access</a> by journalists, academics and bloggers to important government data on schoolchildren. Those with access to the national pupil database were told that in future, they must not write anything about the data without showing it to the government first \u2013 with 48 hours\u2019 notice. \u201cThis will reduce the risk that DfE are caught off guard by being asked to provide statements about research the appropriate people have not seen,\u201d an email said.</p> <p>This is bizarre for a government that spent the past six years banging on about its \u201copen data\u201d agenda. Could it perhaps be a response to those many researchers who were able to show, over and again, that grammar schools do not aid social mobility?</p> <p>In US legal terms a \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect\" title=\"\">chilling effect</a>\u201d is \u201cthe inhibition or discouragement of the legitimate exercise of&#xa0;natural and legal rights&#xa0;by the threat of legal sanction\u201d. In a world where parents are afraid to send their child to school in case it means deportation, and where academics are afraid that telling the government inconvenient truths could risk their livelihood, these are chilling times.</p>",
  "<p>More than 70% of migrants travelling overland through north Africa to Europe have become victims of human trafficking, organ trafficking and exploitation along the way, according to the UN\u2019s <a href=\"http://unitedkingdom.iom.int/\">International Organisation for Migration (IOM).</a></p> <p>The IOM\u2019s surveys of migrants arriving in Europe by boat reveal that nearly three-quarters of those interviewed show strong indicators of having been trafficked or exploited for profit by criminals at some point on their journey. </p> <p>Nearly half of all those questioned (49%) reported being held in a location against their will, often for ransom. The majority of these cases occurred in Libya.</p> <p>Half of migrants said they had worked without pay, with many being threatened with weapons by an employer or labour broker.

As well as collecting information on the prevalence of forced labour and organ trafficking, the surveys also asked about marriage, and forced marriage, while in transit. Fewer than 1.5% of respondents said they had received an offer of marriage in exchange for money along the route. <br></p> <p>On the eastern Mediterranean route \u2013 where migrants travel overland via Turkey and Greece \u2013 14% of migrants reported signs of human trafficking and exploitation. About 6% reported being held against their will, 7% said they worked without pay. As many as 4% said they were forced into work against their will, most of these instances occurring in Turkey. Incidents of organ and blood trafficking were reported in Turkey, Greece, Albania, Macedonia and Serbia. </p> <p>The IOM said its surveys are the first attempt to quantify the prevalence, scale and frequency of labour and other forms of human trafficking on the major migrant routes. </p> <p>\u201cWhat these surveys show is that human trafficking networks are becoming brutal and efficient at exploiting and making profit from the vulnerability of migrants,\u201d says Simona Moscarelli, anti-trafficking expert at the IOM. </p> <p> \u201cThere is still very little real recognition of the scale of this business or just how much money is being made from the misery and labour of people fleeing war or poverty.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Hyland, the UK\u2019s independent anti-slavery commissioner, said that the surveys provide further evidence that the migration crisis is being used by human trafficking networks to target and exploit the most vulnerable. <br></p> <p>\u201cThere is a need for urgent action to protect these people,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe that a key focus for the UK and other governments must include collaborating with partners to prioritise safeguarding against the risks of modern slavery as part of the response to the migration and refugee crisis.\u201d</p>",

Thank you.</p> <h2>The big picture</h2> <p>Last week provided a fair few signs that the path towards the kind of clean, hard Brexit Theresa May outlined to such a rapturous reception at the Conservative party conference will not be without pitfalls.</p> <p>The obstacles \u2013 political, economic, constitutional \u2013 came thick and fast. </p> <p>The one that garnered most media attention, of course, was Marmite-gate, a pricing row between Tesco and Unilever that saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/tesco-running-low-key-unilever-brands-price-row-supplier-supermarket-falling-pound\">the supermarket run short of supplies</a> of Britain\u2019s much-loved (and hated) spread and other famous household brands. </p> <p>That was resolved fairly rapidly. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/15/after-marmite-bitter-taste-price-rises-new-year-2017-retail\">analysts warned</a> it was merely a harbinger of the <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/pro/nick-clegg-chocolate-cheese-prices-will-soar-after-hard-brexit/\">major price rises</a> likely to hit British consumers in the new year as manufacturers and retailers find themselves forced to respond to sterling\u2019s fall against both the euro and dollar, with the pound now <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/12/sterling-rebounds-brexit-fears-bank-of-england-business-live?page=with:block-57fe1163e4b05d915e424186#block-57fe1163e4b05d915e424186\">plumbing record lows</a>. </p> <p>It is in the nature of currencies, of course, that their value fluctuates. More of a worry for the prime minister may be the stiffening parliamentary opposition to her view that MPs need not necessarily be consulted before article 50 is invoked. </p> <p>After several Tory MPs threatened to vote with Labour on the question, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/theresa-may-accepts-need-for-brexit-debate-in-parliament\">May was forced to accept the need for \u201cfull and transparent\u201d parliamentary scrutiny</a> of the UK\u2019s negotiating terms before Brexit is triggered (though she stopped short of allowing a vote). </p> <p>Perhaps heartened by the government climbdown, a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/15/brexit-cross-party-mps-renew-calls-for-parliamentary-scrutiny\">powerful cross-party group of MPs is now demanding it publishes a substantive outline</a> of its plans for the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU \u2013 a \u201cBrexit blueprint\u201d \u2013 and ensure parliament can amend it before negotiations start.</p> <p>That\u2019s not the end of it. Scotland is not too happy, either, with the direction Brexit appears to be taking in the wake of the Conservative conference.</p> <p>The first minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/16/nicola-sturgeon-second-scottish-referendum-likely-in-event-of-hard-brexit\">Nicola Sturgeon, said it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that Edinburgh would call a second independence referendum</a> by 2020 if Britain left the EU single market, adding that she also wanted to explore ways of keeping Scotland in the single market even if the rest of the UK left.</p> <p>Nor, it seems, are some of the most important sectors of the UK economy taking the threat of a hard Brexit lying down. </p> <p>After the French finance minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/14/us-banks-planning-exodus-from-brexit-britain-michel-sapin-french-minister\">Michel Sapin, said US banks were planning a post-Brexit exodus</a> from the City, the Open Europe thinktank said <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/17/banks-could-move-assets-out-of-uk-by-2017-if-eu-passport-is-lost\">some could begin moving assets out of the UK</a> as early as the end of 2017 if no deal is in prospect to maintain their rights to sell services freely across the EU. </p> <p>And the chief executive of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, was sufficiently alarmed at the prospect of tariffs on car exports to seek <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/14/nissan-chief-executive-carlos-ghosn-meets-theresa-may-brexit-talks\">a personal meeting with May, during which she assured him the company would not be penalised</a> by Brexit (although there was no detail on how that might be achieved).</p> <p>The politics of the immediate financial aftermath of Brexit, too, look somewhat delicate, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/18bn-brexit-divorce-bill-eu-payment-boris-johnson\">Downing Street refusing to rule out the UK having to continue paying into the EU budget</a> after its exit and analysis suggesting a \u20ac20bn (\u00a318bn) \u201cBrexit divorce bill\u201d. That is hardly likely to please hardline Brexiters.<br></p> <p>(Separately, the government is reportedly <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/17/cabinet-considers-plan-to-keep-citys-single-market-access-by-pay/\">looking into the possibility of continuing to pay billions of pounds into the EU budget</a> after Brexit to maintain single-market access for the City and other vital sectors.)</p> <p>Doubtless, however, the prime minister will be heartened by the cheering words of her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who told the foreign affairs select committee that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are going to get the best possible [EU] deal for trade in goods and services ... We are going to get a deal which is of huge value, and possibly of greater value. I think those who prophesied doom before the referendum have been proved wrong, and I think they will continue to be proved wrong. </p> </blockquote> <h2>The view from Europe</h2> <p>Leaders from the EU\u2019s 28 (for the time being) member states gather at the end of the week for a European council summit in Brussels that will be May\u2019s first. Brexit won\u2019t be up for formal discussion \u2013 \u201cno negotiation before notification\u201d, as Brussels likes to say \u2013 but the PM will utter the B-word at dinner on Thursday evening. </p> <p>It\u2019s likely to be a fairly chilly affair. Donald Tusk, the council president who will chair the summit, became the latest EU leader to make clear the EU\u2019s view of the situation, saying last week that Britain faced the stark choice of either a hard Brexit or no Brexit \u2013 the first time he has taken such a clear line.</p> <p>Tusk said the leave campaign and its \u201ctake back control\u201d slogan showed the UK wanted to be free of EU law while rejecting free movement of people and contributions to the EU budget: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This approach has definitive consequences.

This makes the Slovenian-born former model\u2019s appearance with Cooper notable even if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations\">more than a dozen allegations</a> of sexual impropriety had not been leveled against her husband over the past week.</p> <p>\u201cEvery Friday something comes out,\u201d Trump told Cooper, dismissing the controversies that have followed her husband since he announced his candidacy for the White House last June.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard, especially for him,\u201d she continued, \u201cbecause he did so many stuff in his life. He was on so many tapes, so many shows. And we knew that, that, you know, tapes will come out, people will want to go against him. But my husband is real, he\u2019s raw. He tells it like it is.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about whether she views her husband\u2019s behavior in the video as \u201clocker-room\u201d stuff, as he has characterized it, Trump agreed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of two teenage boys - actually, they should behave better,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI know how some men talk - that\u2019s how I saw it.\u201d</p> <p>No matter the subject matter, she continued, Trump does not view her husband\u2019s remarks in the video as descriptive of sexual assault.</p> <p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not a sexual assault,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say he did it, and I see many many women coming to him and giving phone numbers, and want to work for him and inappropriate stuff from women. And they know he\u2019s married.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvery assault should be taken care of in court of law,\u201d Trump said, but the accusations made in the media are \u201cdamaging and it\u2019s unfair.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cI believe my husband. This was all organized from the opposition,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any facts and even the story that came out in People Magazine, the writer that she said that my husband took her to the room and start kissing her, she wrote in the same story about me that she saw me on Fifth Avenue and I said to her, Natasha, how come we don\u2019t see you anymore? I was never friend with her. I\u2019d never recognize her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow we could believe her? That never happened.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the pressures of the campaign on her marriage, Trump said, she does not want people feeling bad for her.</p> <p>\u201cPeople think and talk about me like, \u2018oh Melania, oh poor Melania.\u2019 Don\u2019t feel sorry for me, don\u2019t feel sorry for me.

His non-answer provoked much ire, especially since many other athletes were quick to criticise Trump\u2019s remarks.</p> <p>Brady, who threw for 376 yards and three touchdowns in New England\u2019s 35-17 win over the Bengals on Sunday, told Boston sports radio WEEI that he ducked the question because didn\u2019t want to create extra headlines.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s just the way it is right now. Obviously there\u2019s a lot of headlines to make, and I\u2019ve tried not to make a lot of headlines. I\u2019ve been in an organization where we\u2019re taught to say very little, we have respect for our opponents and we don\u2019t do the trash-talking.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing I\u2019ve always thought is I don\u2019t want to be a distraction for the team. That\u2019s what my goal is. Not that there are things I\u2019ve said and done that haven\u2019t been, but you try not to be. It\u2019s just hard enough to win and prepare without the distractions so when you start having the distractions it\u2019s even harder to prepare.\u201d</p> <p>However, Brady\u2019s refusal to answer the question arguably created just as much of distraction for the Patriots, a point which was acknowledged by former New England receiver Troy Brown on Sunday.</p> <p>Brown said: \u201c[He should have said] just something, a quick answer on the question to get it out of the way, just answer the question to say, \u2018I don\u2019t condone it\u2019 and then walk off the stage. The optics of it weren\u2019t great. I understood what he was trying to do. But the next time he\u2019s asked that question, then give a quick answer and let it be. I\u2019m not responsible for what comes out of my friend\u2019s mouth. But I am responsible for correcting my friend.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Brady again said that he and Trump have been friends for 15 years, and that \u201cI\u2019ve always had a good time with him\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/17/tom-brady-donald-trump-press-conference-distraction\">Tom Brady says he ducked Trump questions to avoid team distractions</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58054a18e4b0cd26ff71e1d4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T22:01:59.374Z\">11.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Juanita Broaddrick, on Donald Trump\u2019s accusers:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If these accounts are true, yeah.

It was an important story, of obvious public interest. </p> <p>\u201cABC News and Four Corners stand by the report and reject the claims of the government of Nauru. The interviews with the children were conducted remotely by Four Corners and their stories were subjected to the program\u2019s usual rigorous fact-checking processes. </p> <p>\u201cThe program was made in this way because the Nauruan government routinely refuses journalists access to report on offshore processing and charges prohibitive fees for media visas, which are not refunded if the applications are refused.\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/aug/10/nauru-australia-refugees-detention-centre-asylum-migration-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4p27m\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2619508\"            data-video-name=\"The children of Nauru: 'What\u2019s the point of surviving at sea if you die in here?' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-578cb31de4b073c22786cb87\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/04/160804ChildrenOfNauru_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/04/160804ChildrenOfNauru.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/08/04/160804ChildrenOfNauru_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/08/04/160804ChildrenOfNauru_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/04/160804ChildrenOfNauru_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/aug/10/nauru-australia-refugees-detention-centre-asylum-migration-video\">The children of Nauru: \u2018What\u2019s the point of surviving at sea if you die in here?\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The Nauru government said: \u201cIt was clear that these children were coached and that the entire process of filming the refugees was stage-managed, as the program has not been to Nauru.
